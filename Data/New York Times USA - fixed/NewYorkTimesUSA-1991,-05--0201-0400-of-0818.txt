Black-Held Businesses In Sales Gain

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
The nation's largest black-owned companies, despite weakness in the economy, said they had a 5.2 increase in sales last year from the previous year, according to an annual survey being released today by Black Enterprise magazine. By contrast, the top 500 American companies listed by Fortune magazine showed a 1990 sales increase of 6.4 percent.
Gross sales for the largest black-owned industrial and service companies and automobile dealerships increased to $7.16 billion in 1990 from $6.81 billion in 1989. 
 But the recession took its toll on the work force of the black-owned companies, which cut their staffs by 4.5 percent last year.
"Black businesses have done nothing different than what other businesses are doing," said Earl G. Graves, editor and publisher of Black Enterprise. "They have been cutting costs and delaying capital expenditures. They have cut staffs, delayed buying new equipment and new vehicles."
Mr. Graves added that the chief executives of the nation's largest black-owned companies "reacted to the recession, the retrenchment of government set-aside programs and diminished private procurement opportunities by showing just how good, smart and tough they could be when the chips were down."
 
One Publicly Traded
 Except for the Johnson Products Company, which is traded on the American Stock Exchange, the companies on the Black Enterprise list are privately held and do not report earnings. The sales figures were given to the magazine by the companies. Mr. Graves speculated that there had been a decline in profitablility in the last year among black-owned companies. "My sense is that profitability has followed the general trend of American corporations," Mr. Graves said.
Heading the list for the fourth consecutive year is TLC Beatrice International Holdings Inc., which includes the international operations of the Beatrice Companies. The holdings were purchased four years ago by the investor Reginald F. Lewis. The company, based in New York, reported sales of $1.49 billion in 1990, accounting for about a quarter of the sales on the list of industrial and service companies.
In second place was the Johnson Publishing Company, the magazine, broadcasting and cosmetics company based in Chicago. Johnson Publishing's sales totaled $252.1 million, up from $241.3 million in 1989. The company, whose magazines include Ebony and Jet, led the ranking four years ago.
In the No. 3 spot again this year was the Philadelphia Coca-Cola Bottling Company, which reported sales of $251.3 million, up from $240 million in the previous year's survey.

HEADLINE: Borrowing by Consumers Down for 4th Month in a Row

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 7

 BODY:
Consumers cut back on borrowing for the fourth straight month in March, a degree of spending restraint not seen since 1980, when credit controls were in place, the Federal Reserve Board said today.
The amount of outstanding consumer installment credit -- loans on cars, furniture and other items that are paid off in monthly chunks -- fell by $931 million after declining a revised $201 million in February. 
 Consumer credit debt fell $2.14 billion in January and $342 million in December, adding up to a four-month shrinkage of $3.61 billion in the amount consumers owed.
The Fed, the nation's central bank, said the last time credit debt fell for four straight months was in 1980, when the Carter Administration imposed stiff controls on lenders as part of its war on inflation. Before that, there had not been a four-month period in which consumer credit contracted since the 1958 recession.
Most of the March drop was accounted for by lower demand for new-car loans, while so-called revolving or credit-card loans were the only category of credit that grew.
Analysts said rising credit-card debt was unhealthy in the long term because it reflected consumers' attempt to maintain living standards amid recession by taking on more debt. Credit cards typically carry extremely high interest rates.
"Any increases in spending that we're seeing seem to be those that are put on credit cards," said Jean Sundrla, an economist at Evans Economics Inc. in Washington.
Credit-card debt grew by $3.25 billion in March, compared with expansion of $1.97 billion in March. But auto loans contracted by $2.29 billion after falling $1.12 billion in February and $839 million in January, as consumers put off buying new cars.
Spending in the first quarter was also dampened by the Persian Gulf war, which depressed consumer sentiment. Spending by consumers fuels two-thirds of economic activity.
Loans to buy mobile homes, another measure of credit activity used by the Fed, fell $95 million in March after dropping $258 million in February. Other loans, which include any bank borrowing other than home mortgages, dropped $1.79 billion after falling $791 million in February.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Magazine Publishers Toast A TBWA Ad for Absolut

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
WHEN the nation's magazine publishers gathered last night in New York to salute the best print advertising of 1990, the winner wore a familiar, though welcome, face.
Receiving the 10th annual Stephen E. Kelly Award from the Magazine Publishers of America was TBWA Advertising Inc., New York, for its Absolut vodka ads. It was the second time in three years that TBWA has been honored for its unusually creative and innovative ads for the pricey imported liquor. Singled out this time was "Absolut First Class," an ad that appeared in New York magazine in July, showing a sheet of perforated stickers mimicking postage stamps. The sheet was tucked into a glassine envelope that was bound into the magazine. 
 The award, named for the late president of the magazine publishers group, bestows a cash prize of $100,000 on the executives responsible for producing the winning ad, making it the most lucrative of the many ad awards presented each year by various organizations and assocations.
The difficulty of convincing agencies and advertisers of the efficacy of print in an age of video spurred the group to create the Kelly award in 1982, then to increase the prize five years later to $100,000, from $25,000. The strategy behind the award is to treat the agencies' creative staff people as a target market, encouraging them to think print.
"The more we could focus the attention of creative directors, copywriters and art directors on great magazine advertising, the more we could get agencies and clients that haven't been using magazine advertising to consider it," said James R. Guthrie, the group's executive vice president for marketing development.
Still, such an effort -- even when the usual incentive of a prestigious award is sweetened with 100,000 extra reasons to ponder print -- is clearly a daunting task.
"The agencies that have been winning are the small ones that do a lot of print," said Ted Bell, president and director of creative services of Leo Burnett USA in Chicago.
"I would love for Leo Burnett to win the Kelly Award," Mr. Bell added, and indeed Burnett does produce print ads for giant clients like McDonald's and Oldsmobile. But most of the agency's efforts are directed at television.
This suggests there are limits to what any award can achieve.
"I don't think that an award enters into the media choice, that anyone says, 'Hey, let's do print instead of TV because we can win $100,000,' " said Arnold Arlow, executive vice president and co-creative director of TBWA. (Mr. Arlow, one of six people at the agency and at Carillon Importers Ltd., the importer of Absolut, who are sharing the Kelly wealth, was interviewed before the award announcement.)
Peter Eldredge, the United States publisher of Newsweek magazine, said he hoped the Kelly award "does make some difference." But he added: "What the Kelly award is doing is just one step. We should be doing more." Mr. Eldredge wants additional efforts aimed at young media planners and buyers who were "raised on video."
"They read magazines," he said, "but they don't love magazines."
"Love" is probably the right word to describe the affair between Absolut and the magazine industry. Since 1980, Carillon's strategy to stimulate sales of the Swedish vodka has been to drown readers in a sea of Absolut ads, all different and unusual. There have been talking ads, singing ads, ads resembling jigsaw puzzles and ads in 3-D. The result: Absolut has become the No. 1 imported vodka.
Absolut has also become a sort of patron of the arts, not only in the choice of cutting-edge artists to illustrate its ads, but also in its decision to advertise in the initial issues of magazines like the now-defunct Wigwag, as well as in "downtown" magazines aimed at young, hip readers, like the revamped Details. And Absolut has begun to buy space in publications directed at homosexuals, making Carillon one of the few mainstream marketers addressing those consumers through their own media.
Absolut is important to the continued health of many magazines. Although Carillon does not appear to be joining the advertisers cutting back on print during the recession, some magazine executives say the company and TBWA seem to be driving harder bargains when buying space.

HEADLINE: Laissez-Faire Legacy on Jersey Shore: How Not to Do It

BYLINE: By PETER KERR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SEA BRIGHT, N.J., May 6

 BODY:
So intense and so haphazard is development along the Jersey Shore that it has become an example to other coastal states of what not to do.
For 18 years, builders have taken advantage of a loophole in state law that exempts any development of fewer than 25 units from state regulation. As a result, the 137-mile shoreline is dotted with 24-unit complexes, often shoe-horned in between the beach houses, motels, restaurants, and arcades that make New Jersey's coast one of the most heavily used in the nation. 
 The overbuilding threatens water wildlife and the ecosystems of fragile wetlands.
 
Bill Before Senate
 "In other states they are now saying they want to avoid the New Jerseyization of their shores," said John Weingart, an assistant commissioner in the State Department of Environmental Protection. "We have beautiful beaches, but a huge population that uses them."
As New Jersey again begins its summer campaign to attract visitors to its beaches, environmentalists are pointing to mile after mile of chock-a-block development and are asking the Legislature to restrict overbuilding on the shore.
Next week, a State Senate committee is to hold hearings on a bill that would make developments of 25 or fewer units within 1,000 feet of the ocean subject to state approval. The bill would also require the state to develop a comprehensive plan for future growth in areas near the shore.
But a number of environmentalists say that even if such restrictions are passed into law, the state is going to pay a price for the feverish development of the 1980's. Its legacy, they say, ranges from the traffic jams on the state's highways to the effect of storm water pollution on the fish that swim in coastal waters.
"People who come down to the shore now don't even know what it was once like," said Derickson W. Bennett, the executive director of the American Littoral Society, an environmental group that specializes in coastal issues. "It's just difficult at the shore now to find a place where there isn't somebody else."
Mr. Bennett spoke as he drove his pickup truck down the shoreline road in Sea Bright, a town built on a sliver of sand, a barrier island where several 24-unit condominium complexes were built in recent years. He pointed to the storm drains in parking lots, through which rain washes the oil and other residue from the street out to sea.
Attempts to control development along the shore go back to 1973, when the Coastal Area Facilities Review Act, a bill sponsored by Assemblyman Thomas H. Kean, was enacted. Under the law, developers intending to build along the coastal areas were required to receive approval from the state.
 
1,232 Applications
 But Mr. Kean, who was governor from 1982 to 1990, recalls that under pressure from the state's builders, the Legislature agreed to exempt residential projects of fewer than 25 homes.
Since 1973 the state received 1,232 applications for construction in coastal areas, most of which were large housing projects averaging about 100 units, according to the Department of Environmental Protection. But the state kept no record of the developments of 24 units or less, requiring only the approval of local governments, which often were eager to encourage building that would increase their tax bases.
One count of construction in coastal areas, by The Press of Atlantic City, identified 190 24-unit developments in Ocean, Cape May and Atlantic Counties between 1986 and 1989. The 24-unit complex became so common in coastal areas that shore planners often quip that some day archeologists will try to discern the religious significance of the number 24 in 20th century New Jersey.
In areas like Barnegat Bay, Mr. Bennett said, the water has turned cloudy from sediment washed from the land, blocking the growth of vegetation on the shallow bottom. The runoff of fertilizers from lawns, as well as other nutrients, has often spurred algae growth, which, in turn, has upset the ecological balance of coastal areas. In extreme cases, public beaches have been closed because of high levels of coliform bacteria from storm water and sewage.
 
State Testing of Water
 Questions of how to regulate commercial development in shore areas have become a major subject of debate in many of the nation's coastal states, including Florida, the Carolinas, Georgia and California. Orrin Pilkey, a professor of geology at Duke University who has written extensively about shoreline preservation, said conservation experts in many of those states look to New Jersey as a textbook case of overbuilding.
Despite such problems, some critics of environmental groups in New Jersey say, with rare exceptions the water at public beaches in the state has been clean and safe and the state closely monitors the water during the summer months.
"I'm not sure what horrendous impact we are talking about," said Michael Gross, a lawyer who represents builders along the shore. "The D.E.P. has said the water was never cleaner. The statement that development has been uncontrolled, that is an exaggeration."
As a result of the extensive development of housing projects with fewer than 25 units, Governor Kean enacted an emergency order in October 1988 extending state review to most of those projects within 1,000 feet of the ocean. Gov. Jim Florio adopted a similar policy, but it was struck down by an appeals court last December.
 
Developers' Proposal
 Senator Paul J. Contillo of Hackensack, a Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Committee on Land Use and Regional Affairs, said builders were willing to support the bill that would extend state regulation of developments with fewer than 25 units. But, Senator Contillo said, the builders want any master plan for coastal development to be subject to an economic impact study and a vote of the Legislature. The committee is to vote on the bill on Monday.
In an interview today, Mr. Kean said he would urge the Legislature to adopt stricter regulation of development on the coast, in part to protect the state's tourism industry.
"You can kill the goose that lays the golden egg," Mr. Kean said. "You can make the Jersey Shore the type of place where people would not want to go."

HEADLINE: Housing Plan In New York Taps Banks From Abroad

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Several large foreign banks, concerned that their lack of local lending in New York City could hurt their standing with banking regulators, are joining a lending program to finance construction of new low- and moderate-income housing.
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo is expected to announce the program today as part of an effort to attract more foreign capital and business to New York. 
 It comes as American banks are making stronger efforts to comply with the Community Reinvestment Act passed by Congress in 1977. The act does not specify how much banks should lend within their local community, but requires that they provide satisfactory service locally if they want approval for other projects, like acquisitions of other banks or expansion into new businesses.
"There is increasing interest among foreign banks in how they can participate in community-reinvestment kinds of lending," said Lyndon Comstock, president of Community Capital Bank, a new Brooklyn bank specializing in loans to areas of the city that many banks have shunned.
 
$10 Million Committed
 Cathy Wilde, director of the New York City Housing Partnership, which will channel the foreign banks' funds to developers of low- and moderate-income housing, said investment from foreign banks in local real estate is increasingly important because American banks have grown more cautious about real-estate lending since suffering large losses on loans. "Without investments by foreign banks in areas outside Wall Street and midtown Manhattan, we are going to come up short," she said.
As of late yesterday, banks had committed at least $10 million to the program. The goal is $100 million, officials said.
To encourage the cash-rich foreign banks, many of whom have little knowledge of city neighborhoods or small real-estate developers, the State of New York Mortgage Agency will insure 75 percent of the bank loans against loss.
The housing developments to be financed by the foreign banks will be selected by the Housing Partnership, a nonprofit organization that has completed about 6,000 owner-occupied housing units since it was founded in 1982. The group now has about 1,500 units under construction. "We are not a consumer or retail lender, so the Housing Partnership can help us by providing expertise for lending we could not do on our own," said Allyn W. Keiser, general manager of the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.
"This combines good citizenship with good credit quality," he added.
The Canadian bank is one of half a dozen expected to join the effort. Others considering the program include the American branches or affiliates of Barclay's Bank of London; Banco Popular of Puerto Rico; and four Japanese banks, Sumitomo Bank, Fuji Bank, Bank of Tokyo and the Industrial Bank of Japan.
Masahiro Nagayasu, vice president at Fuji Bank, said, "We do not have our own staff for lending to the local community, so we have to trust somebody to do the credit decision-making for us."
Bankers Trust Company, a New York bank, is also participating in the program as a lender and to coordinate the collection and disbursement of funds from other banks.
Kenneth H. Thomas, a banking consultant in Miami, noted that foreign banks in the New York area have received lower ratings under the Community Reinvestment Act than domestic banks "because the foreign banks have not done much local lending."
The program grew out of discussions between the partnership, the banks and the state's director of economic development, Vincent Tese. As a condition of their participation, the banks insisted that the state insure their loans and assist low-income applicants in obtaining mortgages.

HEADLINE: WORLDWIDE EFFORT TO AID BANGLADESH CALLED TOO LITTLE

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 7

 BODY:
The world has failed to mount an adequate relief effort to help survivors of last week's deadly cyclone in Bangladesh, international relief agency and United Nations officials said today.
At a meeting in Dhaka attended by representatives from the United Nations Disaster Relief Organization and the United States, Japan, Britain, France, Germany, the World Bank and nongovernmental aid agencies, the Bangladeshi Government appealed for $1.4 billion for relief and reconstruction, of which $670 million would be for immediate relief and $740 million for help in rebuilding the country. 
 Speakers at the meeting said tighter organization of relief efforts was needed. Officials there said that the United Nations Disaster Relief Organization was expected to lead coordination with the Bangladeshi Government and that Hamed Essafi, director of the United Nations agency, had spent the last five days in Bangladesh and was drawing up a plan of action.
 
Copters and Medicines Needed
 The United Nations Disaster Relief Organization said on Sunday that Bangladesh urgently needs helicopters, 10 million water purification tablets, tents, plastic sheeting, emergency medical kits, drugs, particularly anti-diarrheal medications, and milk powder.
Other urgently needed items, like rice, beans, shallow-draft boats, cooking oil and utensils, are available in Bangladesh, but the means to transport them to the affected areas are lacking, the report said.
Although the official death toll in Bangladesh stands at just over 125,000, relief officials estimate that as many as 200,000 people have died and up to 10 million others remain homeless. Of the 10 million, 4 million are classified as "in immediate risk," that is, in urgent need of food, medicine and clean water, said Philippe Boulle, the New York director of the United Nations Disaster Relief Organziation.
United Nations and relief agency officials argue that without a large and immediate infusion of aid as well as helicopters to transport it to remote areas, another 100,000 or more Bangladeshis could die.
 
Comparable to '70 Disaster
 "This crisis compares closely with the 1970 cyclone in Bangladesh that claimed half a million lives," said John Hammock, executive director of Oxfam America. "Recovery is going to cost hundreds of millions of dollars."
Saudi Arabia, the leading international donor, has given $100 million to the Bangladeshi Government for the relief effort. Other aid donors include the European Community, which has given $12 million; Britain, $7 million; India, $5 million; Pakistan, $4.3 million; Japan, $2.5 million, and Canada, $1.5 million.
But so far, the relief effort has been organized in a haphazard fashion. The United Nations has not had access to the funds and does not know how the Bangladeshi authorities will disburse the aid. United Nations officials emphasize that the relief effort requires extraordinary organization so that well-meaning donors do not send goods that may be available in the country.
The officials at the Dhaka meeting asserted that the problems in Bangladesh were far more serious than the refugee crisis in Iraq and appealed to governments in general to commit more funds to Bangladesh and to the United States in particular to divert some of the helicopters currently being used to help Iraqi Kurds.
 
Worse Than Kurdish Situation
 Between 20,000 and 30,000 Kurds have died, and an estimated two million Kurds are either refugees in Turkey and Iraq or displaced inside Iraq.
"The Kurdish crisis is just a blip on the screen compared to what we're facing in Bangladesh," said Tom Getman, director of government relations at World Vision, a private relief organization.
In Washington, the deputy State Department spokesman, Richard A. Boucher, announced today that the Administration was authorizing an additional $5 million in grants to nongovernmental organizations for the Bangladesh relief effort and would reprogram $2 million in funds already in Bangladesh for the effort. The Administration has already authorized $2.1 million in grants, medical supplies and equipment and water purification equipment.
The Administration has allocated more than $200 million to help the estimated two million Kurdish refugees and displaced persons who have fled their homes and has asked Congress to approve another $150 million in supplemental aid. The Administration estimates that the Kurdish relief effort will cost the United States and its allies between $500 million and $700 million in the first six months.
United Nations officials said today that the United States, as well as other governments they did not name, had thus far turned down their requests for helicopters, and that they lacked the funds to rent private helicopters.
 
No Decision on Helicopters
 Mr. Boucher said no decision had been made on sending American helicopters to Bangladesh. "The substantial transportation assets do exist in the country," he said. "There are boats that can be mobilized, and part of the $5 million that I announced will be available for logistic support to distribute the relief to the victims and disaster by truck and boat."
Bangladesh, which has been hit by 55 cyclones since 1900 and 8 of the world's 10 worst floods of the last decade, has enough food in warehouses inside the country to feed the survivors of last week's storm. But it is still raining in the areas where the homeless are located, and overland transporation is impossible.
What complicates the Bangladesh relief effort is that tragedy struck on the heels of other emergency relief crises: that of the Iraqi Kurds and a worsening famine in the Sudan. "If Bangladesh had happened at any other time, there would be a much more massive outpouring of support," said Lisa Mullins, program officer for foreign disaster assitance at Interaction, an umbrella group of more than 100 relief organizations. "But then again, there's no geopolitical interest in Bangladesh."
Even some private benefactors are reluctant to transfer to Bangladesh money intended for other causes. Sponsors of an international celebrity concert that will be staged Sunday on behalf of Kurdish refugees said there was no current intention to divert any of their receipts to Bangladesh.

HEADLINE: G.A.O. Job Study Expected To Fuel Trade-Pact Debate

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 7

 BODY:
A study by the General Accounting Office has found that employment in the Los Angeles furniture industry has dropped by as much as one-tenth in the last three years as companies have moved to Mexico in pursuit of lower wages and less stringent environmental laws.
The study, scheduled for release on Wednesday, is likely to provide further ammunition for members of Congress who have contended that a proposed free-trade agreement with Mexico would prompt many American companies to move their factories there, depriving the United States of jobs and despoiling the Mexican environment. Organized labor and some environmental groups have opposed granting the Administration the negotiating authority it seeks for the proposed pacts. 
 Administration officials have testified repeatedly that American companies with any interest in moving to Mexico have already done so. The Administration and some economists also maintain that economic development in Mexico offers the best hope for protecting the environment there.
The Administration is seeking so-called fast-track authority to negotiate trade agreements for the next two years, including one with Mexico, and submit them to a single yes or no vote in Congress with no amendments allowed. Resolutions have been introduced in both houses of Congress to cancel this authority, and if either house passes such a resolution by the end of this month, the fast-track authority would be canceled.
The G.A.O. study estimated that up to 28 wood furniture manufacturers moved from Los Angeles to Mexico in the last three years. A survey of some of these companies found that 83 percent of them identified high wages in Southern California as a reason for the move and 78 percent "cited stringent air pollution emission control standards for paint coatings and solvents" in Los Angeles.
The study also said that Mexico had not established air pollution standards for paint coatings and solvents in the region near its northern border.
Representative John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan, commissioned the study for the House Subcommittee on Commerce, Consumer Protection and Competitiveness.
In a statement prepared for delivery on Wednesday, Representative Cardiss Collins, Democrat of Illinois and head of the House panel, said the G.A.O. report was "the first documentation that manufacturers do, in fact, relocate to avoid environmental regulation."
President Bush is scheduled to meet Wednesday morning at the White House with several environmental leaders in a bid to win their support for the fast-track authority.
The plan was submitted to Congress last Wednesday.
Mr. Dingell sent letters today to the United States trade representative, Carla A. Hills, and Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher seeking reactions to the study, said Victoria Clarke, a spokeswoman for Mrs. Hills.

HEADLINE: More Woe for Dinkins: Income-Tax Revenue Is Off

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
The Dinkins administration said yesterday that income-tax collections from April were running significantly below the city's already shrunken expectations in the crucial final weeks of the fiscal year.
A city lawyer disclosed the problem yesterday at the closing of a sale of $1.2 billion in short-term notes, saying that income-tax payments made around the April 15 tax deadline were $80 million below expectations. The trend raised new concerns about the city's ability to balance its budget before the fiscal year ends on June 30. 
 But Dinkins administration officials tried to discount the significance of the revenue problems. They said that much of the shortfall was likely to be offset by $30 million in increases in other tax revenues and $40 million in revenue from stepped-up city audits.
 
Holtzman's Concerns
 However, with the city already struggling to close a $465 million budget gap this year and a $3.4 billion gap for next year, City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman said the lower tax collections were a real concern, indicating that the situation "is not even stabilizing."
City officials have repeatedly reduced their estimates of income-tax and sales-tax collections during the last year in response to the worsening local economy.
City officials also disclosed yesterday that they were counting on as much as $77 million in new aid from the state to help close this year's budget gap. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo has promised to help make sure the city ends the fiscal year with a balanced budget, but this is the first time details of the state's plan have become known.
City officials said state tax officials had agreed to provide $50 million this year by speeding up the final reconciliation of city income taxes collected by the state, a process that in the past was completed in November. The state has also agreed to restore $27 million in funds for the city that Albany had proposed cutting. The money is a payment that the state has made each year to cover the city's losses from the elimination of a state tax on the transfer of stock.

HEADLINE: Latin Immigrants in Capital Find Unrest a Sad Tie to Past

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 7

 BODY:
With the smell of tear gas lingering in the air, Central American immigrants said today that the unrest in their neighborhoods was rooted in what they saw as brutality and discrimination by the Washington police and was an unwelcome reminder of the strife they thought they had left in their native lands.
After two nights of disturbances that prompted the imposition of a 7 P.M. curfew today, the Mount Pleasant district and part of the Adams-Morgan area in the Northwest section of Washington are reminiscent of battle zones, with storefronts and vehicles left smoldering and police officers in riot gear patrolling in groups of half a dozen or more. 
 The damage shows that the demonstrators were discriminating about what they attacked: amid the looted drug stores and supermarkets, Salvadoran restaurants and Guatemalan artisans' shops were untouched.
"We left El Salvador to find peace," said Mario Pineda, a 22-year-old construction worker. "But what did we find here? No jobs and bad police."
Roberto Flores, a 21-year-old Salvadoran bricklayer who was loitering on an Adams-Morgan street corner today with Mr. Pineda, nodded his head in agreement.
"The problem is racial discrimination," he said. "Everyone looks down on us. Fifteen days ago when I was assaulted by some blacks, I asked the police for help and they told me to put my hands up like I was the criminal."
The street violence began Sunday night, shortly after the police wounded a Salvadoran man who they said was wielding a knife. The incident ignited long-held resentments in the densely populated streets about two miles north of the White House where most of Washington's Central Americans live.
For many of them the incident recalled the role of the police in their home countries and the sense of injustice they felt when they left. In street-corner interviews in their neighborhoods today, many residents expressed anger toward the police here, and complained of abuse and disrespect by American institutions.
Comparisons by Central Americans of the police in Washington to the police in their own countries reflected their frustrations more than the facts of the alleged brutality. Tens of thousands of people have disappeared in El Salvador and Guatemala at the hands of security forces in the last 15 years.
 
'It's the Same Repression'
 Jose Mendez, 23, a Salvadoran carpenter, said, "It's the same repression, though in El Salvador it's about politics. Here it's about discrimination."
A 48-year-old Salvadoran house painter who would only identify himself as Jose, said: "The problem is the police shot a Salvadoran man who was handcuffed. They could have arrested him and taken him to jail -- that is supposed to be the American way to do things."
Instead, he suggested, the authorities here are not much different from the Salvadoran security forces.
Mayor Sharon Pratt Dixon announced the new curfew this afternoon. The 7 o'clock starting time was five hours earlier than on Monday night. The curfew ends at 5 A.M.
Tonight, in sharp contrast to the tear gas, rock throwing and fires of the previous two nights, it was relatively quiet.
The police started enforcing the curfew at 7 P.M., and by 8 o'clock there was only a trickle of pedestrians on the street. Those who could not identify themselves or persuade the police that they were on their way home from work were usually arrested.
By late tonight the police had arrested 23 adults and 10 youths on charges of violating the curfew, disorderly conduct or disturbing the peace. The police also said there had been two stabbings and a shooting in the general area of the disturbances, but were unable to connect them to the street disorders of the last two nights.
"We feel that the community is in support of what the city government is trying to do," said Lieut. Reginald Smith, the chief spokesman for the police department.
 
Mayor at Command Center
 At about 10:15 P.M. Mayor Dixon came out of the command center that the police have set up on the outskirts of the Mount Pleasant area and said, "So far we have nothing to report, which I'm very happy about."
At least 1,000 of the city's 4,800 police officers have been assigned to the troubled district.
More than 40 people were arrested Monday night for curfew violations. They were taken to a night court, and most decided to pay a $300 fine rather than go through a trial.
None of dozens of people interviewed today would admit that they had participated in the disturbances, and many refused to speak at all. But several descriptions of the violence indicate that most of the participants were Salvadorans, Guatemalans, Nicaraguans, Panamanians and Colombians.
Young blacks and teen-age gang members took advantage of the mayhem, especially on the second night, to steal money and food.
"It's just like Guatemala except what happens back home during the day happens here at night," said Armando Marroquin, a 29-year-old restaurant waiter who arrived in Washington from the Guatemalan city of Esquintla seven months ago. Referring to the Salvadoran man shot by the police, he spoke like a man seeking revenge for a death squad slaying: "The people took reprisals for the Latino brother."
On a couple of looted stores, red graffitti scrawled on the wooden siding covering the broken windows called for "justicia," the Spanish word for justice. Also scrawled on the panels were the acronyms of three revolutionary groups fighting the Government in El Salvador.
"The same oppression that there is in my country, there is here, too," said Juan Perez, 38, an unemployed Salvadoran. "The police are the same as in El Salvador. For the simple pleasure of it, they harass people. The rioting is the response to years of oppression."
The disturbances also appeared to unleash tensions between Hispanic and black residents, with each group blaming the other for the violence.
 
Blacks Accused of Stealing
 Andrea Blanco, 25, a waitress at the El Tazumal Salvadoran Restaurant, said Hispanic youths threw rocks through store windows but it was the blacks who stole. "They've taken advantage of the situation and we take the blame," she said of the blacks.
Jacqueline Grooms, a 43-year-old black housewife, said that because of the misbehavior of Hispanic residents she and her neighbors were choked by tear gas fumes even though they stayed in their houses. "They came over here with malice in their hearts," she said. "They trash the neighborhoods."
But another black woman, Janet Poteat, 33, a supermarket worker, compared the unrest to past disturbances involving blacks. "The Spanish people are going to have to be heard the way we were in 1968," she said. "They are in the streets with no hope."

HEADLINE: Human Threat Ruled Out in Drug for Cows

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 7

 BODY:
A new Congressional report concludes that genetically engineered bovine growth hormone, which is being used to increase milk production in cows, poses no safety hazards to humans or to the animals in which it is injected.
The report, prepared by the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment, agrees with the Food and Drug Administration that the hormone does not pose the fundamental danger that some scientists, consumer groups and state regulators have contended it does. 
 But the Congressional agency also said widespread commercial use of the hormone was likely to put greater economic stress on many small dairy farmers, because it was likely to push milk prices downward.
The report, to be issued on Friday, is likely to strengthen the position of companies now pressing the Federal Government for commercial marketing approval. It gives members of Congress an independent technical basis for refusing to override attempts by the Food and Drug Administration to approve such growth hormones for widespread commercial use. Until now, the drug agency has allowed their use in dairy herds only on an experimental basis.
 
Safety in Humans
 In its report, the Congressional office agrees with the drug agency and says the hormone is very unlikely to turn up in milk consumed by humans, and that even if that happens, it would have no effect on humans.
The agency reiterated the opinion of most scientists in the field, saying that bovine growth hormone's effects were specific to cows and that the drug "does not elicit any of its normal biological actions in humans, even if injected." The report notes that bovine growth hormone has a unique three-dimensional shape that can only attach to cells in dairy cows.
Genetically engineered versions of the natural hormone, although having slightly different molecular structures, would be equally unlikely to affect humans.
The use of the hormone, technically known as bovine somatotropin, has been a source of heated debate among groups worried about its safety as well as its economic effects on farmers. Supporters of the drug contend that it can increase a cow's milk production by 10 to 25 percent. But some consumer groups have argued that important safety issues have not been addressed, and many smaller farmers have been alarmed about the hormone's effect on their livelihoods.
Four companies have developed genetically engineered versions of the drug and have applied for Federal approval to begin marketing it. They are the Monsanto Company, the Upjohn Company, the American Cyanamid Corporation and Eli Lilly & Company.
Industry representatives said the report provided further vindication of their views. Richard D. Godown, president of the Industrial Biotechnology Association, a trade association in Washington, said the Congressional agency "is verifying what the industry has been saying all along: that bovine growth hormone is a safe product and one which will benefit society."
 
Consumer Group's Concerns
 But the Consumers Union, the publisher of Consumer Reports magazine, said the report was only based on a review of published literature and had failed to delve into issues raised by unpublished documents within the Food and Drug Administration. Dr. Michael K. Hansen, a biologist at the Consumer Policy Institute, the research division of Consumers Union, said, "Our concerns are not from what has been published, but by what's not been published -- what the F.D.A. has and is not releasing."
Mr. Hansen said the drug agency raised concerns to Monsanto in l988 about evidence that cows treated with the hormone were affected by inflammation of the udder and reproductive problems. If valid, he said, the result could be that cows would need more treatment by antibiotics, which might then make their way into humans.
But the Congressional report dismissed those concerns. It confirmed that cows showed a decreased pregnancy rate and a slightly altered fertility cycle, but said the changes were associated with high milk yields and not the effects of growth hormone.
The report noted the concerns about a growing incidence of inflammation of the udder and other ailments, but said that "no such effects have been observed" and "nor have subtler health effects been in evidence."
Milk and meat both appear to be essentially unaffected by the hormone, the report continued. Milk showed slight variations in fat content in the first few weeks of hormone treatment, the report said, but the changes were temporary and smaller than those that occurred in a cow's natural lactation cycle. It said the meat from treated cows had a lower fat content but was otherwise identical.
But the agency did warn that use of growth hormones could speed the trend toward larger, technology-driven farms and a smaller total number of cows in use. "Such changes inherently put increased pressure on traditional dairy farms," the report concluded. "The trend will no doubt accelerate in the 1990's as the result of the combination of BST and other cost-reducing technologies."

HEADLINE: EATING WELL;
Are Cattlemen Now Guarding The Henhouse?

BYLINE: By MARIAN BURROS

 BODY:
ON April 24, after three years of study, research, consultations and discussions with consumers, the Agriculture Department sent its Eating Right Pyramid to the printer. This new chart was to have replaced the food wheel used since the 1950's to provide information about a healthy diet.
The next day Agriculture Secretary Edward R. Madigan announced that he was indefinitely delaying the chart's publication. Through a spokeswoman, Kelly Shipp, Mr. Madigan said many groups had complained that it was confusing and that it had not been tested on children. 
 But other Federal officials and health professionals, outraged by the Secretary's decision, said the pyramid was withdrawn because meat and dairy producers objected to what they felt was the pyramid's negative depiction of their products.
"It's very clear this is the effect of pressure from the cattlemen," said one Agriculture Department official who spoke only on the condition of anonymity. The official was referring to a meeting the Secretary held with board members of the National Cattlemen's Association, a producers' group, on April 15. "Up until the cattlemen came to their meeting with the Secretary, the Eating Right Pyramid was being released," the official said.
 Mr. Madigan has denied succumbing to pressure from commodity groups. But the reversal on the pyramid highlights the dual role of the Agriculture Department, the Federal agency in charge of educating the public about nutrition as well as the agency representing the food industry. Critics say that if the department surrenders to producer interests on matters of nutrition education and withdraws a well-researched teaching tool like the pyramid, why should the public believe anything it says about nutrition?
Even agency officials fear a loss of credibility.
"No one is going to believe us," the Agriculture Department official said, adding that cancellation of the pyramid "is tainting everything the department is doing."
"You don't need nutrition education from U.S.D.A. if it's going to be controlled by special-interest groups," the official said.
Gerald Combs, who retired last Friday from the department as deputy administrator for human nutrition, said: "For almost eight years, until this release came out, I had had no surprises and no pressures. Issues were dealt with on the basis of scientific fact and objectivity. I was terribly upset by this announcement. I don't know of any valid reason for the decision made so abruptly and handled so badly. One can only jump to all sorts of conclusions. My concern is that people will think the department has no integrity or objectivity."
Health professionals outside the agency were less surprised.
"There's a long history, going way back, of U.S.D.A. changing dietary policy because of the food industry," said Dr. Marion Nestle, chairwoman of the nutrition department at New York University. "I saw this all the time during the preparation of the Surgeon General's report on nutrition and health." Dr. Nestle was the editor of that report.
At the center of the controversy is the four-level pyramid, which has grains and cereals as its base. The next three levels, in ascending order, are fruits and vegetables, meat and dairy products and at the tip, fats, oils and sweets (with the advice "use sparingly").
The pyramid recommends 6 to 11 servings a day of grains and cereals, 2 to 4 of fruit, 3 to 5 of vegetables and 2 or 3 each of meat and dairy products. The number of servings called for by the chart are the same as on the old food wheel; the only difference is the way the information is presented.
"The Eating Right Pyramid emphasizes foods from the five food groups shown in the three lower sections of the pyramid," says the text that was to have been published with it. "Each of these food groups provides some, but not all, of the nutrients you need. Foods in one group can't replace those in another. No one food group is more important than another; for good health, you need them all."
At the April 15 meeting with Mr. Madigan, the cattlemen said the pyramid, which they had seen without the text, gave the impression that some foods were good and some, specifically meat, were bad.
On April 19 the American Meat Institute weighed in with its complaints. In a letter to the Secretary, the trade association said it had "neither seen the pyramid nor been consulted about it," but that to clear up confusion the Agriculture Department should "reject adoption of the 'Eating Right Pyramid.' "
The National Milk Producers Federation joined the chorus with complaints that dairy products were stigmatized by being next to the fats and oils on the pyramid.
The pyramid had not been kept secret. It was presented at a Public Voice for Food and Health Policy conference in Washington in March. It was talked about at the American Dietetics Association conference last year.
"It kind of makes you wonder where the cattlemen were for the last year," said the Agriculture Department official.
Despite the outcry, there is no unanimity about the pyramid in the meat and dairy businesses. The National Livestock and Meat Board and the National Dairy Council, trade associations that have more contact with consumers than the producer groups, have been aware of the pyramid for quite a while and have not protested. In fact, the National Dairy Council uses a similar illustration in its publication "Healthy Dividends."
Mr. Madigan said the pyramid was being withdrawn because it had not been tested on children, but on Friday Steve Abrams, the department's deputy assistant secretary for food and consumer services, added a new wrinkle.
In a telephone interview, he said the Secretary also wanted the pyramid tested to see if low-income families could understand it. He said Mr. Madigan wanted other symbols tested, too, though he could not provide a date for the new testing.
The pyramid was created as an illustration for a food guide intended to provide practical information to the public on how to use United States Dietary Guidelines, the Federal Government's advice for healthful eating. The food guide and the dietary guidelines are both geared to people with a high school education.
"The pyramid was never specifically targeted to children," said Dr. Rachel Ballard-Barbash, director of the nutrition policy staff in the Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion at the Department of Health and Human Services. The office worked closely with the Agriculture Department on the pyramid.
"Dietary guidelines were never intended to be read by children," Dr. Ballard-Barbash said. "Nutrition guidance is a particularly complex area. In my view it is naive to think it should be understood by children." Mr. Combs, the newly retired Agriculture Department official, concurred.
Research on the pyramid, which included work with two "focus" groups, made up of ordinary consumers, as well as interviews in a shopping mall, showed that people understood the purpose of the pyramid.
"No one came away with the feeling of good foods, bad foods," Dr. Ballard-Barbash said.
The pyramid and its text were reviewed by outside professionals who work with nutrition information and by the Agriculture Department's interdepartmental committee that includes a liaison from Health and Human Services.
 Dr. Ballard-Barbash said her agency was concerned about the turn of events at the Agriculture Department, as are many people who worked for three years on the pyramid.
Before Mr. Combs retired he proposed a compromise in a letter to Charles Hess, an Assistant Secretary of Agriculture. "I suggested the blocks of the pyramid be modified to be directly in proportion to the median serving size," he explained.
Letters urging Mr. Madigan to reconsider have been sent by the American Cancer Society, the Society for Nutrition Education, the American Dietetic Association, the United Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Association and the Center for Science in the Public Interest.
The Center for Science, a nutrition advocacy group, urged the Secretary "to demonstrate that your department has not put agricultural industry needs ahead of the public's health by resuming plans to publish the pyramid now."
Mr. Abrams, the deputy assistant secretary for food and consumer services, said he thought Congress "will believe Ed Madigan on these matters."
"He spent 18 years in Congress and is credible on health and nutrition issues," Mr. Abrams said.
But Representative Ted Weiss, a Manhattan Democrat who heads the Human Resources and Intergovernmental Relations Subcommittee of the Committee on Government Operations, has asked for all of the Agriculture Department's records on the Eating Right Pyramid.
"We are not surprised by allegations that U.S.D.A. succumbed to industry pressure to abandon the Eating Right Pyramid," Mr. Weiss said. "This provides the committee with the opportunity to review the capacity of U.S.D.A. to deal objectively with the conflicting duties of protecting the public's health while also promoting the economic well-being of the meat and poultry industry."

Award for Greenmarket
The New York City Greenmarket program has been honored for its contribution to city life, winning the Rudy Bruner Award for Excellence in the Urban Environment. 
 The annual award, named for a business executive and friend of Frank Lloyd Wright who died in 1967, has been given annually since 1987 by the Rudy Bruner Foundation to the project that best combines the successful interaction of social, economic and esthetic elements to demonstrate the reaffirmation of urban areas.
The Greenmarket program, sponsored by the City Council for the Environment, has established markets in the five boroughs where farmers sell food they produce.
The Bruner award is more than mere honor. It includes a prize of $25,000. Program officials said they would use some of the money to match a state grant for making improvements at the markets, including building portable market shelters. The winnings will also be used to help complete a study on local farm survival.
 
Gravlax, Homemade
A new product, Mar-Seche, is a blend of salt, sugar, dill and spices for making gravlax at home. The process, consisting of rubbing a boneless piece of raw fish with the dry marinade, covering it, weighing it down and refrigerating it from eight hours to two days, could not be simpler.
Salmon is the fish typically used for making gravlax. For best results, it is important to run your hand over the fillet and remove any tiny bones with a tweezer. After the fish has been cured, slice it thin and hold each slice up to the light to check it again.
Before making the gravlax, take the precaution of freezing the raw salmon for 72 hours at 0 degrees Fahrenheit to destroy any parasites that may be lurking.
Fresh sea bass and fluke can also be used to make gravlax, and the marinade can also cure scallops and tuna. Do not use it for freshwater fish, which should never be consumed raw.
Mar-Seche, a formula devised by Richard G. Sanders, owner of Grace Tea Company, is available by mail from the company, 50 West 17th Street, New York, N.Y. 10011. Two 6 3/4-ounce jars, enough for about 12 pounds of boneless fish, are $10.95 including postage.
 
Downtown Pies
Bubby's, at 120 Hudson Street (North Moore) in Manhattan, is a cozy cafe with a menu of hefty sandwiches and simple, homestyle food available to eat in or take out. When it comes to dessert, Bubby's can stand in for a bakery. The homemade pies in cookielike crusts are especially good.
Cherry, caramel apple, banana cream, cranberry and cranberry-pear are some of the flavors usually on hand. The pies are sold by the slice for $3. A whole 10-inch pie is $18.50 to $20.50, depending on the flavor. Miniature pies, enough for two people, are $4.50.
Bubby's also has a chocolate cake, a single intense, yet light, layer dusted with powdered sugar, for $3 a slice.
 
Cookbook Contest
There is a special competition for community cookbooks, those books published as fund-raisers by nonprofit organizations. Created by the McIlhenny Company of Avery Island, La., the makers of Tabasco, the competition is open to books published in 1990 and 1991 that have not been previous winners.
The deadline for submitting books for consideration by a panel of judges is Oct. 1. Winners receive a donation of as much as $1,000 to the charity benefiting from the book.
Previously published community cookbooks that have sold more than 100,000 copies are also eligible to be named to the Walter S. McIlhenny Hall of Fame.
Entry forms and contest rules are available from Tabasco Community Cookbook Awards, c/o Hunter MacKenzie Cooper, 41 Madison Avenue, New York N.Y. 10010; (212) 679-6600.
In 1990, the first year of the competition, "From a Lighthouse Window," published by the Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum, won first prize.
Runners-up were "Gracious Goodness: A Taste of Memphis" published by the Memphis Symphony League and "Spice and Spirit: The Complete Kosher Jewish Cookbook" published by the Lubavitch Women's Club of Brooklyn.
Regional prizes were awarded to six other books. One, "The $2 Billion Cookbook" was published by volunteers in Anchorage, Alaska, who were working to clean up the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Prince William Sound.
 
KING OF THE WINE FRONTIER
THE label on the bottle of California wine says Parker, not as in Robert, the wine critic, but as in Fess, the actor who played Davy Crockett and Daniel Boone on television. The gold label has a tiny coonskin cap on it. Fess Parker has gone into wine making with his son Eli.
The first of the wines from their ranch in Santa Barbara County, a supple 1989 chardonnay for about $15 and a 1989 Johannisberg riesling in a lush Spatlese style for about $9, are now available in the East. Mr. Parker is also preparing to play Rhone Ranger, planting Rhone Valley-style grapes like viognier, marsanne, syrah and mourvedre.
The wines are sold at Park Avenue Liquor Shop, 292 Madison Avenue (40th Street); Sherry-Lehmann, 679 Madison Avenue (61st Street); Heights Chateau, 131 Atlantic Avenue (Henry Street), Brooklyn; Zachy's, 16 East Parkway, Scarsdale, N.Y.; Young's Liquor Store, 505 Plandome Road, Manhasset, L.I., and Murphy's Liquors, 106 Closter Plaza, Closter, N.J.

Back in New York
Harry Belafonte is an optimist. Though America is mired in recession, the country's civil rights agenda has faltered and its cities are in turmoil, the 67-year-old singer and human rights advocate says he finds hope in the patterns of history.
"It's not the first time we've entered a dark age," he said in a telephone interview in Manhattan last week. "The antebellum period, which gave rise to the Ku Klux Klan and segregation, was also a dark age that ended the short-lived euphoria of blacks who believed they would be able to participate in this new union. We had to go through that period before the civil rights period came and took things to another level. I have to hope that history will continue to repeat itself." 
 This evening, Mr. Belafonte, who lives in Manhattan, is to give his first concert in the city in more than 30 years. It is to be at Avery Fisher Hall, to benefit the Ensemble Studio Theater. Although he has continued to perform all over the world and in the suburbs of New York, he said he decided years ago that it would be unwise to wear out his welcome in the city where he was born and became famous.
"Being born in New York and having got my start here, I had painted myself into a corner," he said. "One day I woke up and realized that there was nothing I hadn't done here. I decided I would only come back at those moments when I had something significant to do or say."
Mr. Belafonte is to perform what he called "the old, the new and the unimagined" in a program that will include music from Brazil, the Caribbean and Africa. Some songs are to be taken from his 1988 album, "Paradise in Gazankulu" (EMI-America), a record of African-oriented music that drew little attention when it was released. Mr. Belafonte said he paid close attention to the world-music movement, especially to African music. He hopes, he said, to work one day with the Senegalese singer Youssou N'Dour.
Musically, Mr. Belafonte is still best remembered for igniting the calypso craze in the mid-1950's with songs like "Jamaica Farewell" and "Banana Boat (Day-O)," and with the album "Calypso" (RCA), one of the first long-playing records to sell more than a million copies.
"I was absolutely amazed at the response to the music, especially that of white America," he said. "I can't think of another music from an outside source that has impacted on the American popular music world so strongly. The 50's were an apolitical time in America. Singing those songs was as political as one could get while still trying to sell something."
"All my life, I've spent a lot of time wondering how to break stereotypes," he said. "I've often thought that if those who participated in oppression could be made to understand that their humanity was equal to mine that they would be required to challenge their own prejudice. If you sing my song and enjoy it, you're going to want to know a little about who I am."
These days, music is only one of many facets of Mr. Belafonte's career. He recently signed a production agreement with New Line Cinema to develop seven movies and has bought the rights to August Wilson's play "Joe Turner's Come and Gone." Denzel Washington, Sidney Poitier, Morgan Freeman and Danny Glover have all agreed to appear in the film, for which Mr. Wilson will write the screenplay, Mr. Belafonte said.
 
Color Me Badd
 Hip-hop doo-wop is the catchy term that the pop group Color Me Badd has invented to describe its sound, which combines four-part pop-soul harmonies with electronic hip-hop beats and occasional short raps.
One variant of that sound has already propelled the group's first single, "I Wanna Sex You Up," to No. 12 on Billboard's pop-singles chart in just six weeks. The biggest hit from the sound track album of "New Jack City" (Giant/Reprise), "I Wanna Sex You Up" has a loping pop Latin beat that is similar to the Young Rascals' "Groovin' " and Laura Nyro's "Stoned Soul Picnic," and a piercing lead vocal by Bryan Abrams, whose voice resembles that of the late-1960's Stevie Wonder.
The four members of Color Me Badd, who come from Oklahoma City and who have been living in the New York area for nearly two years, are all 21 years old and have been working together for six years. Besides Mr. Abrams, the group includes two second tenors, Sam Watters and Mark Calderon, and Kevin Thornton, a baritone.
They said they first heard doo-wop a cappella singing in a jeans television commercial, which they taught themselves and performed in a school talent show. "Confucius said that the best prophet for the future is the past," Mr. Abrams said in a group interview last week when asked to explain why the group has delved so far in the past for its sound.
Mr. Watters added: "We don't try to make pop music, and we don't try to make R-and-B music. The name Color Me Badd means that we ignore all boundaries."
It was through sheer persistence that the quartet got itself a record contract. When big-name acts would play Oklahoma City, the group would follow them around and perform spontaneous auditions. One afternoon, Mr. Thornton spotted Jon Bon Jovi in a movie theater; he telephoned the other band members, who came to the theater, waited for Mr. Bon Jovi to leave, and insisted on singing the 1961 doo-wop hit "Daddy's Home." Mr. Bon Jovi promptly invited the group to be his band's opening act for an audience of 15,000 the next night.
It was Robert (Kool) Bell of the pop-funk group Kool and the Gang who helped the group find management and a record deal.
Color Me Badd recently completed its first album, which is to be released in early July.

HEADLINE: Educator's Legacy: Success, and Shaky Finances, in Several Districts

BYLINE: By WILLIAM CELIS 3d

 BODY:
Long before Walter L. Marks was blamed for the bankruptcy last month of the Richmond, Calif., school district, his reputation had been cast: An innovative administrator and educator whose concept of budgets was elastic at best.
In 20 years, Mr. Marks served five school districts, was ousted from two of them and left a third under mutual agreement with the board. As superintendent in four of the districts -- Richmond; Lake Travis, Tex.; Wake County, N.C., and Montclair, N.J. -- he introduced magnet school programs acclaimed for integrating racially polarized districts and improving curriculums and students' performances. 
 But he left the Wake County and Richmond districts in fiscal chaos -- a grand jury is investigating what happened to Richmond's finances -- and during his tenure in Montclair a state audit took the district to task for accounting lapses.
"He's one of the sharpest curriculum and instructional minds I've ever known," said James A. Adams, superintendent of the Fort Myers, Fla., schools, who as superintendent in Montclair in 1972 hired Mr. Marks as a curriculum director. "But sometimes his vision to get things done doesn't match reality."
Most education experts agree that magnet school programs and other improvements like those created by Mr. Marks would be expensive in any district. But he has been criticized for playing down the true costs and forging ahead with his innovations.
"When you talk about adding programs, you are talking about adding cost," said Thomas A. Shannon, executive director of the National Association of School Boards. "That can sometimes lead to disaster."
In Richmond and his previous positions Mr. Marks proceeded with his grand plans largely unchecked, according to many current and former school officials in those districts. He skillfully sold his plans to board members, who rarely quizzed him because they so wanted and needed the changes he promised -- and delivered.
He has charisma, too, these former associates said, so that when they challenged him, and he gave his stock answer -- "It's in the budget" -- they were inclined to believe him. Most board members said they did not know how to analyze a budget, or lacked the time.
When officials of a new school system came to court him, they were always so impressed by the educational achievements he had fostered that they tended to overlook questions about his handling of budgets.
Mr. Marks, who started his new job as superintendent of the Kansas City, Mo., schools on March 1, declined repeated requests for interviews about the Richmond bankruptcy and his experiences elsewhere. In several articles in The Kansas City Star after his arrival in Missouri, Mr. Marks said Richmond's financial difficulties reflected the souring California economy and grants that had failed to come through.
Members of the Kansas City board said they believed his assessment. But when California officials approved a court-ordered $19 million bailout of the Richmond system last week, they castigated Mr. Marks for his management there.
 
Making a Name in Cleveland
 After receiving a bachelor's degree in elementary education from Glenville State College in West Virginia in 1960, Mr. Marks worked in small Ohio schools. In his spare time, he earned master's and doctoral degrees in education from Kent State University and Ohio State University, respectively.
By 1971, he caught the notice of Robert Holloway, the superintendent of the Beachwood Public Schools in suburban Cleveland, who hired him as an assistant high school principal. There, Mr. Marks began a program that allowed gifted students to pursue an independent course of study and receive one-on-one instruction.
"It worked real well in the beginning because he picked the cream of the crop," said Walter McMahon, a retired Beachwood teacher. But the program did not survive Mr. Marks's departure very long, he added, largely because it required too many teachers.
Even before the program's demise, however, Mr. Marks encountered criticism. Some teachers said that he introduced a radical idea too quickly and that he hired acquaintances or friends as consultants.
Less than a year he began work, he was threatened with a school board inquiry into the hirings and was dismissed, Mr. Holloway said.
"I couldn't find it in my heart to be too vindictive under the circumstances," Mr. Holloway said. "I brought in Walter Marks to do a job, and he did it."
Mr. Holloway gave Mr. Marks a good recommendation when school officials from the Montclair Public Schools in New Jersey called.
 
Suspicions in Montclair
 After two years as curriculum director at Montclair, Mr. Marks succeeded Mr. Adams as superintendent in 1974 and catapulted to national prominence with his magnet school program. It was intended to desegregate the schools without mandatory busing, using upgraded, specialized curriculums to lure white students into predominantly black schools, and vice versa.
The plan worked, but within months questions arose over how the improvements were being financed. Eventually, the Montclair League of Women Voters asked to see district financial records and requested a state audit.
"We had strong suspicions that our school budget was being overspent," said Patricia Koechlin, chairwoman of the league's education committee in 1978 when the group sought the audit. For example, she said, the district would ask for 20 lawn mowers in one budget year and then ask for the same number the next year.
The audit uncovered accounting lapses, and the state recommended tighter controls on finance. These were instituted, and the Montclair programs continued running successfully.
In 1981, after he had been at Montclair for 10 years, Mr. Marks went to Wake County, which had recruited him to overcome problems similar to those he had helped solve in Montclair.
Wake County officials traveled to Montclair to assess Mr. Marks's work with the magnet system. They brushed aside questions about the audit, said Charlotte Martin, a Wake County board member who traveled to New Jersey.
In his three years as superintendent in Wake County, Mr. Marks worked his magic once more with magnet schools to desegregate the schools. But again there were skeptics.
"I was very leery from the beginning," said Ann Koonce, a board member during Mr. Marks's tenure. "I didn't think people would come into the inner city. And I didn't think it was possible for him to do everything he wanted to do for how much he said it would cost."
Mrs. Koonce admits being wrong about her first worry; the program was a success in integrating schools in and around Raleigh. But her fears about money were correct. The local newspaper, The News & Observer, began reporting irregularities in the school budget, and as a result the board requested an audit by the state education department.
After months of scrutiny, the state, in 1984, ordered the district to repay $489,000 in Federal grants designated for poor children, saying the money had instead been funneled into Mr. Marks's magnet program, which included students ineligible for Federal aid.
In addition to repaying the money, the district had to raise taxes to keep the magnet program operating.
At the same time, Mr. Marks's personal style -- his Lincoln Continental, his large house and the redecorating of his office with expensive leather furniture -- rankled board officials, who were also perturbed by his demand, which was not met, that his wife, Diane, a teacher he married in Montclair, be hired as an assistant principal.
But it was the misuse of Federal money that ultimately unseated Mr. Marks, as a second audit found an additional $60,000 in misused Federal money. He and the board agreed he should leave.
Mr. Marks taught briefly at Texas A&M University, and then in 1985 returned to school management, as superintendent of the Lake Travis Independent School District outside Austin.
The small district of 1,800 students needed an academic jump start and several new buildings. Dusting off his ideas, Mr. Marks started several programs, including Spanish for kindergarten students and an independent education foundation to award college scholarships to graduates.
Taxpayers groused about the changes, and about the expensive new administration building erected under Mr. Marks's guidance.
"He was changing so many things," said John Burns, a parent. "The biggest negative is he moves too quickly and the community does not have a chance to catch up."
Lake Travis officials said they were told about the fiscal problems in Wake County by school officials there, but Jack Reynolds, a board member at the time, said that over all Mr. Marks was given "a very pleasing recommendation."
Indeed, despite the grumbles, when Richmond officials came to recruit Mr. Marks, Lake Travis board members were so pleased with his work that they debated suing him for breach of contract if he left.
 
A National Reputation
 When he arrived in the sprawling Richmond district northeast of San Francisco in 1987, students' test scores were low and teachers were dispirited. The district, ethnically and economically diverse, was polarized.
Mr. Marks's school-choice program, a variation of his magnet programs, tried to pull white students into minority schools and vice versa. Extra teachers and administrators were hired (including Mr. Marks's wife, who became an elementary school principal), and all teachers and administrators received raises. In time, the program helped improve students' test scores.
"But almost immediately, it became apparent that he was going to implement expensive programs without any input from teachers and parents," said Ernie Ciarrocchi, executive director of the United Teachers of Richmond."People opposed him, but Walter is nothing if not a good salesman."
If the board sensed that the district was overspending, little was said initially. And understandably: Richmond basked in a national spotlight in 1989, when the Education Secretary, Lauro F. Cavazos, visited and pronounced the district a national model for school-choice programs.
But last year, it began unraveling, as expenses grew significantly, partly because extra people were required for the school-choice program.
When, as a condition for a $9 million loan from the state, a state-appointed trustee moved in to oversee the district's finances, he said the district's accounting was so shoddy that nobody knew how many people were actually employed. A head count was undertaken and showed that the district's personnel costs were over budget by $7 million.
Last December Mr. Marks was dismissed.
Now as the Richmond system struggles to regain its financial balance, many blame Mr. Marks. But others are more philosophical.
"I think his tragic flaw was that he wanted to believe in what he was doing," said Pat Howlett, who ran the district's public relations office under Mr. Marks. "He found ways to justify what he was doing. He reached."

HEADLINE: Violent Impasse in Seoul

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, May 8

 BODY:
One of the more revealing moments in the flare-up of violence between student demonstrators and the South Korean Government over the last two weeks was the hasty retraction of comments by a senior member of the ruling party that the much-feared plainclothes riot police should be disbanded.
 The politician, Kim Chong Hoh, the Democratic Liberal Party's floor leader in the National Assembly, told reporters he had asked the Interior Minister to dissolve these forces, which were notorious for their rough tactics long before they beat a student to death with steel pipes two weeks ago. But the party spokesman later insisted no such request had been made or was planned. 
 Despite most Koreans' growing frustration with the cycle of demonstrations and clashes that poison the air with tear gas this time of year, the reversal was a sign of the immense resistance on both sides to new thinking that might avert the annual ritual of running street battles.
The Government's opponents have, in some ways, only grown fiercer in their determination, taking the most extreme measures in years. There has been a series of suicides to protest the earlier killing of the student.
Today a 24-year-old dissident set himself on fire, then leapt from a building at Sogang University in Seoul. It was the fourth such self-immolation.
The violence, which has spread across the country, also seems increasingly out of step with the more moderate image South Korea is trying to project internationally; Seoul is seeking membership in the United Nations and a greater voice in regional affairs.
The stances of both the Government of President Roh Tae Woo and its opponents seem hardened in another era, while the middle classes appear fed up with unyielding attitudes.
 
Sign of Weakness Feared
 Kim Kyung Won, a former Ambassador to Washington and head of the Social Sciences Institute in South Korea, said both sides are locked in place out of fear any conciliatory steps would be perceived as a sign of weakness, which the other side would exploit with even harsher attacks.
"This has become a structural problem," said Oh Sae Chull, an economics professor at Yonsei University.
That intransigence stands in stark contrast to the bold diplomatic steps President Roh has taken over the last year. South Korea has wooed the Soviet Union and China. It has also won some international support by holding a round of local elections, with plans for another set in June. But the old order of violent dissent and heavy-handed Government responses reigns on.
Part of the problem is the Government's falling credibility. Despite his recent overseas triumphs, Mr. Roh's domestic position has been eroded by recent student deaths, a major industrial pollution scandal and a corruption scandal involving several former Government officials, according to Park Choon Ho, a law professor at Korea University.
"The public will not give the Government credit for its diplomacy if it is not seen as taking the initiative for getting rid of corruption," Mr. Park said.
 
Cabinet Official Dismissed
 Eager to allay the distrust, Mr. Roh was quick to dismiss his Interior Minister after the beating death of the student on April 26. That came a few days after he dismissed his Environment Minister over the pollution scandal. Mr. Roh also issued an apology for the student's killing, and five riot policemen were later arrested.
For the students, the death was an opening to win back some of the public support they have lost in recent years. The public has grown weary of political strife and eager to enjoy this country's increasing wealth.
After the latest suicide, a prosecutor called for an investigation into what he said appeared to be an organized program among dissident leaders to compel young followers to kill themselves to advance the movement.
Indeed, each death has become another focal point for further demonstrations. The funeral of the student killed earlier is set for Thursday, and it is feared there will be violent confrontations around the nation.
The demonstrations have been fiercer and attracted more students than at any time since the presidential election in 1988. Tens of thousands of students have demonstrated at various times in the capital as well as more than a dozen provincial cities.
While many hope for some conciliatory measures to at least halt the suicides, there are few optimistic signs.
Mr. Roh speaks frequently of strengthening the country's three-year-old democracy. Yet the plainclothes riot troops, who are trained in the martial arts and carry truncheons or steel pipes, are a carryover from the years of military rule.
In addition, the Government has yet to ease or amend the National Security Law, a vague ordinance that permits the Government to detain just about anyone it suspects is a threat to order.
The students' short-term goal seems clear: to disrupt the elections slated for June, and thus rob the Government of a chance to improve its credibility. The Government, in turn, has yet to show that it has a broader plan for ending the cycle and building a unified nation in the South before it tackles building a unified peninsula.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR;
Firefighting Pace Quickens in Kuwait Oilfields

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KUWAIT CITY

 BODY:
Slowly, the recovery of Kuwait's oil industry, its only basic industry, is taking shape.
Firefighters can now arrive at a small burning well in the morning, extinguish the fire and cap the flow of oil before dusk, and roll their equipment off toward another well, to be ready for the next day. 
 The continuous application of manpower, proven oilfield methods and tons of equipment airfreighted from Houston are gradually yielding results. More than 10 percent of the 600 dynamited wells have been brought under control, the first step for Kuwait in resuming its role as one of the world's largest exporters.
The Kuwait Oil Company can find the remains of its heavy equipment among the convoys of Iraqi vehicles destroyed by allied aircraft during the retreat, but despite the destruction of war, Kuwait still has infrastructure.
The country lacks tools and spare parts, and blames the Iraqis for stealing everything, right down to the bulbs in the traffic signals. But the amount of heavy civil engineering work now needed is fairly modest. The airport control tower must be rebuilt, but the runways are still there and in service. The ports need new cranes or repairs to existing ones, but they, too, are in operation.
 
Buildings Still Standing
 It will take many square miles of plate glass to restore Kuwait City to its pre-war appearance, but the buildings are still standing. Around the country, the roads need patching but few need rebuilding. Many were under construction at the time of the invasion, and they wait to be finished.
The land here, whether crossed by roads or not, is easily traversed by bulldozers, heavy trucks and the other equipment used in an oilfield. This is far more than can be said of many frontier areas where international oil companies are accustomed to doing business.
Kuwait also has capital. If this is not always evident in the oilfields, where purchasing agents sometimes scrimp, buying used equipment that breaks down, it is evident in the streets and highways here. The streets are crowded with fleets of white 1991 Chevrolet Caprice sedans, ordered by the Government for its own use, and car carriers full of shiny new police cars, with emergency lights on top and Kuwaiti markings painted on the sides, could be seen crossing the border from Saudi Arabia.
 
Bureaucracy Hampers Effort
 Wealth is also evident in the private sector; pickup trucks speed by with refrigerators and freezers, and the markets are stocked with everything from chandeliers to designer sunglasses.
The most important ingredient, the oil, is still there; even if some wells have to be re-drilled, the prospect for success is nearly 100 percent.
Outside the oil sector, other parts of the rebuilding effort are hampered by a choking post-war bureaucracy, the Kuwaitis' inability to do the work themselves, and desire not to let too many non-Kuwaitis in to do the work. Kuwaitis complain that they lack the computers, fax machines and other conveniences to run their country.
But the oil sector, in the hands of foreigners since its inception more than 50 years ago, does not suffer from the same problem. Skilled foreigners fly in daily from Dubai on a chartered flight, without visas.
Kuwait Oil Company is represented at each well, as is customary in the oil business around the world, by a "company man," but most of those company men are Americans. It is possible to spend days at the wells themselves watching Americans and Canadians fight the fires, aided by Indian mechanics, Sri Lankan truck drivers and Banagladeshi laborers, and never see a Kuwaiti.
The goal of the firefighters now working is 50 wells a month, which would mean that wells will still be burning next spring, more than a year after the Iraqis were driven out.
 
Production Being Restored
 But oil exports could resume long before the last fires are out; as the firefighters move from well to well and finally field to field, other oilfield service technicians can move in behind them, repairing the capped wells and putting them back into service. In any given location, firefighting may preclude production, because the pipes that formerly carried oil to the terminals and tankers in the gulf are instead carrying seawater inland, for firefighting.
But Kuwait's oil wealth is spread over hundreds of square miles, tied into 26 separate gathering systems, and then exported through several different terminals, depending on the location of the well. Resumption of their production above the level of gathering station need not be closely synchronized; Ahmadi, southwest of Kuwait City, where firefighting began, will undoubtedly be back in production before some of the wells to the north are even touched.
In addition to the wells, there are other problems; some storage tanks and port installations were hit by allied bombs, and must be repaired.
 
Meeting Domestic Needs
 But plans are to start production in May, by tying 20 surviving wells around Ahmadi into one mostly intact gathering station, to produce 50,000 barrels a day. That amount is small by Kuwait's prewar standards, about 3 percent of the country's OPEC quota of 1.5 million barrels a day, and small even by prewar consumption standards. But with the country's population reduced by about half, it might meet domestic demand, ending the paradox of having to import oil into the country with a tenth of the world's known reserves.
By late this year, the Kuwait Oil Company hopes to be producing 100,000 more barrels a day, with exports resuming on a small scale by year end. Full recovery, the company thinks, will take five years.
This could take longer, as everything in Kuwait seems to these days. But recovery might also be more than full; the country may finish with more capacity than it had when it began. Its prewar capacity was estimated at 2.1 to 2.2 million barrels a day, but it always had more wells than its ports could handle. In rebuilding, it may re-size.
This, however, may depend more on politics than engineering. Iraq has reportedly told customers that it is ready to export 600,000 barrels a day, pending a lifting of the United Nations embargo. It badly needs the revenue to rebuild. Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, which spent heavily on the war, need revenue too, and will not be inclined any time soon to sacrifice market share for Iraq.

HEADLINE: CONSUMER RATES;
Money Fund Yields Lower As Analyst Cites Confusion

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields of money market funds monitored by IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report fell for the week that ended yesterday.
Walter S. Frank, the chief economist at IBC/Donoghue's, said he saw much confusion in the market. "The Fed has lowered interest rates but as yet gotten no response except from the short end of the market, where it has control," he said. The Government's quarterly refunding this week will temporarily block the way of lower rates, as yields of government securities rise to attract investors.
 
Maturity Days Unchanged
 Tax-exempt money fund yields declined for the week, with the average number of days to maturity of securities held in portfolios unchanged at 45. Fund assets increased by $465 million, to a total of $88.1 billion. 
 For the period that ended yesterday, the average seven-day compounded yield fell by 12 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 4.32 percent, while the seven-day simple yield fell by 11 basis points, to 4.23 percent. The 30-day compounded average yield increased by a basis point, to 4.30 percent, and the 30-day simple yield rose by a similar amount, to 4.21 percent.
The taxable equivalent of the current tax-exempt compounded yield is 6 percent for investors in the 28 percent tax bracket and 6.26 percent in the 31 percent tax bracket.
Of the tax-exempt funds with assets of more than $100 million monitored by IBC/Donoghue's, the General California Municipal Money Market Fund, distributed by the Dreyfus Service Corporation in Garden City, L.I., had the best return for the second straight week, at 5.31 percent.
 
Taxable Assets Higher
 The assets of taxable funds rose by $1.5 billion, for a total of $458.4 billion, with those of institutional funds up by $2.5 billion, to a total of $116.6 billion. Donoghue's analysts think institutionals may be parking money in the money funds while the quarterly refunding is taking place. But the assets of consumer funds were down by $1 billion, to $341.8 billion. The smaller investors may be looking elsewhere for higher returns, the analysts said.
The average seven-day compounded taxable yield fell by 9 basis points in the week, to 5.81 percent, while the 30-day yield fell by 7 basis points, to 5.93 percent. The seven-day simple yield was 5.65 percent and the 30-day one was 5.76 percent, both down, by 9 basis points and 7 basis points, respectively.
The taxable fund with the best return was a Merrill Lynch & Company fund, the Merrill Lynch CBX Money Fund, with a yield of 7.14 percent, including capital gains.

HEADLINE: Licenses for 2 Trump Casinos Are Renewed

BYLINE: By WAYNE KING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, May 8

 BODY:
State regulators conditionally renewed gaming licenses for two of Donald J. Trump's Atlantic City casinos today amid concern about his tottering finances, propped up just last December at one of the casinos by a $3.5 million cash infusion disguised as a chip purchase by his father.
Licenses were renewed at the Trump Castle and the Trump Plaza by a unanimous 5-to-0 vote by the Casino Control Commission in Atlantic City. One requirement for obtaining and holding a casino gaming license is "clear and convincing proof" of financial stability on the part of both the casino and its owner. 
 The commission voted to renew the two licenses, but left open the question of Mr. Trump's financial stability until next month. In the meantime, Mr. Trump and the casinos must file weekly cash flow reports and progress reports on meeting payments to bond holders.
The commission took a similar action last month regarding Mr. Trump's other Atlantic City casino, the Taj Mahal, imposing the same conditions.
 
Cash-Flow Difficulties
 In both instances, the major concern was not about the casinos, although they have experienced cash-flow difficulties amid a weakened economy and the impact of the recent Persian Gulf war on travel, but on Mr. Trump's personal financial stability. He has had to sell off many assets, restructure more than a billion dollars in debt, and plans to declare the Taj Mahal bankrupt in June to protect himself from creditors during restructuring, Mr. Trump and his advisers have told the commission.
Valerie Armstrong, a commission member, voted to renew the casino licenses in all three cases, but said today that she remained concerned not only about overall stability, but also specifically about a chip transaction at the Trump Castle last December that amounted to a sub rosa loan. The casino paid a $30,000 settlement to the state's Division of Gaming Enforcement in the matter, but the commission has yet to approve or reject the settlment.
Mr. Trump's father, Fred, a New York real-estate investor, purchased $3.5 million in gambling chips from the casino, but never used them, leaving the $3.5 million in the casino's coffers. The money was then used to make a bond payment that the casino otherwise did not have enough cash to make.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Up in Quiet Trading; Gold Prices Also Higher

DATELINE: The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar rose yesterday in quiet trading as investors were heartened by the results of the Treasury's bond auction.
Gold prices were mostly higher, rising in all major markets except Zurich. Gold picked up 60 cents on the Commodity Exchange in New York, closing at $357.10 an ounce. The Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $357, up 70 cents.
There were few events to influence domestic currency trading, but the market was reassured by good demand for the $11.96 billion in 10-year notes the Treasury sold yesterday, said Kevin Logan, chief economist for the Swiss Bank Corporation in New York. 
 If United States bonds are attractive to foreign investors, the dollar gets a lift because overseas buyers must purchase dollars to pay for their new securities.
The Government sold the bonds as part of its three-day quarterly refunding auction.
Analysts said the dollar was also helped by news that President Bush suffers not from a heart ailment, but from a treatable thyroid condition.
In earlier European trading, the dollar rose on news that an American warplane came under antiaircraft fire while flying over northern Iraq Tuesday night. The report was subsequently played down by United States officials.
The dollar tends to rise in times of international strife because it is seen as a haven for investors.
Dealers said the United States currency was also helped by unsubstantiated rumors that the president of the German Bundesbank, Karl Otto Pohl, was about to resign. The rumors sent the mark falling.
The dollar rose to 1.7312 marks in New York from late Tuesday's 1.7175. In Europe, the dollar advanced to 1.7330 German marks, from 1.7210 late Tuesday.
The British pound fell against the dollar, dropping to $1.7200 in New York, from $1.7265 late Tuesday. In London, sterling fell to $1.7180 from $1.7205.
The dollar rose against the Japanese yen in New York, closing at 138.30 yen, up from 137.80 late Tuesday. In Tokyo overnight, the dollar fell 0.54 yen, to 137.88 yen, and in London, it was quoted at 138.30 yen.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday's prices, included: 1.4630 Swiss francs, up from 1.4530; 5.8585 French francs, up from 5.8155; 1,281.25 Italian lire, up from 1,270.50, and 1.15245 Canadian dollars, up from 1.15105.
Earlier in London, gold rose to a late bid price of $357.25, from $356 late Tuesday.
In Zurich, gold fell to a closing bid of $356.65, from $356.85 late Tuesday. Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.19 to close at a bid of $357.55.
Silver closed at $4.047 an ounce on the Commodity Exchange, up 1.1 cents. Earlier in London, silver was unchanged at a late bid of $4.05.

For more than three decades, Arnie Brown waited for a redevelopment plan that would revive the last old section of this city's downtown district, an area known as the Ninth Square, just blocks from the town green and the towers of Yale University.
Four years ago, Mr. Brown tired of waiting. He sold his family's shoe store on Chapel Street in the Ninth Square. The storefront's new owners operate an adult book store and a peep-show parlor. 
 "We have had so many promises for the area, it is unbelievable," Mr. Brown said.
Today, most of the Ninth Square remains a motley collection of boarded-up storefronts and soaped windows. It is very likely to remain that way for the foreseeable future because of a decision by the Connecticut Housing Finance Authority not to approve $52 million in bonds needed for the latest plan to revitalize the area with a mix of stores and housing.
 
Austerity Measures Imposed
 The project's scrubbing, though, is just the latest fiscal problem to strike this long-suffering city. And the troubles, which are found in many Northeast cities these days, are weighing particularly heavy on Mayor John C. Daniels, a well-respected former state senator, who was elected this city's first black mayor 18 months ago.
Last month, Mr. Daniels laid off 120 employees, or 5 percent of the city's non-education work force, to avoid a $6.2 million deficit for the current fiscal year. His other austerity measures included delaying the opening of some parks until July 1 and leaving the main library open only 24 1/2 hours a week and its three branches, 15 hours.
More foreboding, perhaps, is the fiscal situation for next year.
The city, which already has the highest property tax rate in the state, has a gap of $40.9 million between projected revenue and departmental budget requests for the fiscal year beginning on July 1. The budget for the current fiscal year is about $255 million.
"There is a lot of hopelessness out there," Mr. Daniels said. New Haven's fiscal problems stem, in part, from a slowing growth in its tax base, which rose by only 0.2 percent for the year ending Oct. 15, 1990.
City officials attribute the stagnation to the regional recession, the continuing commercial and residential flight to the suburbs, a high office vacancy rate, the generous tax abatements awarded to some downtown developers by previous administrations and the tax-exempt status of many properties held by Yale, the city's largest landowner.
The Mayor also attributed the financial problems to a lack of county or regional government, which forces large and poor cities in Connecticut to pay for many of their own social services.
 
Outside Aid Dwindles
 Peter Halsey, the comptroller, said that Federal aid has been sharply curtailed, and state aid, under the 1991-92 budget proposed by Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., would rise from about $100 million this year to $110 million next year. "The state is not going to be our salvation," he said. "We will be happy to keep what we have got."
What little optimism was left about the city's fiscal future was dashed with the cancellation of the Ninth Square project. Mr. Daniels said he feared it might also dissuade other potential downtown developers like the Taubman Company, which has expressed an interest in building a new shopping mall in the city. "This project may have been the litmus test," he said.
"It is a dead end," said Arthur Horowitz, whose family has owned a yarn shop in the Ninth Square area for more than 50 years. "At this point, I can't see anything happening until the economy starts up again, and that could be another 10 years."
 
Political Payback to Some
 The decision not to approve the bonds was made, housing administration officials said, because of the state's fiscal problems and the level of risk in the project.
Many New Haven officials believe, though, that the demise of the project, which was backed by the previous governor, William A. O'Neill, a Democrat, is a political payback aimed at Mr. Daniels, a Democrat, who actively supported former Representative Bruce A. Morrison of Hamden, a Democrat, for governor over Mr. Weicker, who created the Connecticut Party before leaving the Republican Party.
"I want to believe that it's not politics," said Mr. Daniels, who is seeking re-election this fall but has said he intends to run for governor in 1994, "and I have to take the Governor's word on it that he wants to help cities, that he wants to provide jobs for the cities, that he wants to provide housing for the cities, that he wants to give the cities an economic boost.
"Well, this was the project to do that, and it didn't happen," he said. "And I have yet to this day received a solid reason as to why the state is not going to do this project."
The project had the financial support of Yale, which had pledged $10 million. "We still believe it is a good project, and would like to see it revived and succeed," Shelia W. Wellington, Yale Secretary, said. "It is important for New Haven socially and economically."
As New Haven officials search for a way to revive the Ninth Square project and solve their fiscal problems, they are being pressed to increase social services, particularly in the city's poorer neighborhoods. For example, New Haven, which has a population of about 130,000 and is the third largest city in Connecticut, after Bridgeport and Hartford, has the highest infant mortality rate in the nation.
The city, which was chosen as the site of the nation's first urban-renewal project and later became known as the original model city, has also experienced a rising level of violent crime, much of it prompted by the increased use of illegal drugs and the growing prevalence of gangs.
Nine murders have been committed in New Haven this year. The most publicized, by far, was the slaying of a Yale sophomore, Christian H. Prince, on Feb. 17 a block from the home of the Yale president, Benno C. Schmidt Jr. The slaying has not been solved.
"It did considerable harm to the city in terms of the efforts we are trying to make to try and uplift the image of the city," Mr. Daniels said of the killing of Mr. Prince.
He added, though, that town-gown relations with Yale, had never been more harmonious. Yale is the city's largest employer. New Haven has an unemployment rate of 6.2 percent compared with 5.9 percent statewide.
Mr. Daniels also dismissed widespread criticism that Yale's contributions to the city were not enough. He noted that last October the university had agreed to place its golf course on the city tax roll and to make contributions for Fire Department services.
"What do I say to Yale?" Mr. Daniels said, "I say, 'Thank you.' "

In Clashes, a Hispanic Agenda Enters

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 8

 BODY:
The riots of the 1960's in Watts and Washington helped to push the questions of civil rights, political representation and economic opportunities for blacks to the top of the national political agenda, and this week's disturbances in the capital could focus national attention on the wide array of problems facing Hispanic Americans.
Certainly the spasms of violence on Sunday and Monday night were dramatic enough, with hundreds of youths throwing rocks, bottles and other missiles at police officers, setting fire to cars and trucks and looting more than a dozen stores. 
 And certainly the television cameras caught the fury of the crowd. It was a civil version of the war in the Persian Gulf, with battering rams instead of Scuds. A city watched live as youths bashed in the doors of a fried-chicken restaurant while customers inside huddled in terror and the police, having been withdrawn for the moment, were nowhere to be seen.
An exigent curfew imposed by Mayor Sharon Pratt Dixon calmed the streets on Tuesday night, and she has promised to do a number of things to attack the underlying problems, like recruiting many more Spanish-speaking police officers.
Leading Hispanic officials joined in the effort to steady nerves. Representative Solomon P. Ortiz, a Texas Democrat who is a former sheriff, broadcast messages on Spanish-language radio.
But many Hispanic leaders doubt that there will be a serious national effort to attack the problems affecting the more than 22 million people of Hispanic descent living in the United States. (That figure, which comes from the 1990 census, is almost certainly too low because of systematic undercounting, the Cenusus Bureau concedes; it works out to 9 percent of the national total, whereas Hispanic people probably account for about 10 percent.)
"You can already hear people saying that this is an isolated instance, that things are different in other cities, that we should leave things to local officials and everything will be fine," said Margarita Roque, executive director of the Hispanic caucus on Capitol Hill. "But in cities across the country, our people feel like they do in Washington -- no access, no local elected officials, no recourse."
There are no Hispanic senators or governors at the moment, though there have been some in the past. There are 10 Hispanic members of the House (including 4 from Texas and 3 from California), which is only 2 percent of the total, and Hispanic people account for less than 1 percent of all elected officials in the country, according to the census.
Hispanic people face intractable problems that are significantly different from those of other minorities. If blacks tend to be disenfranchised by their failure in many cases to register to vote, Hispanic Americans often do not even get that far. Rob Paral of the National Association of Latino Elected Officials says that 37 percent of all Hispanic people living in the United States are aliens.
Large numbers of those are in the country illegally, which makes their integration into American life difficult if not all but impossible.
Another difficulty is the reluctance of many Hispanic people to learn English -- a pattern mentioned by many blacks and whites in the Mount Pleasant and Adams-Morgan neighborhoods here as an explanation of ethnic tensions.
But there is more to it than that. For those who remember 1968, this week in Washington has brought eerie and disheartening echoes of that year, when white politicians, merchants and journalists admitted that they had been totally surprised by the explosions in black communities. This time both whites and blacks here, including Mayor Dixon, who is black, have made such confessions.
The problems will not go away now any more than they did then, and they will confront more and more communities as the Hispanic population is diffused through the nation. Ten years ago, for instance, there were few Hispanic residents in Rhode Island, which is now 5 percent Hispanic, or Nevada, which is now 10 percent.
For that matter, few Washingtonians, though vaguely aware of the Salvadoran and Guatemalan refugees who have been settling among them, would have guessed that the District of Columbia is now at least 7 percent Hispanic, with large Hispanic communities in the Virginia and Maryland suburbs, too.

HEADLINE: Productivity Error Fixed

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 8

 BODY:
Correcting an embarrassing mix-up, the Labor Department issued a new report today on the productivity of American workers to officially fix inaccurate figures issued earlier this week.
Today's report confirmed that American workers' productivity rose 1 percent from January through March. 
 On Monday, the Labor Department first reported that productivity fell nine-tenths of a percent during the first quarter of 1991. Eight hours later, the agency caught the mistake, and said productivity actually increased 1 percent. It said there had been a mistake in transmitting data between the Commerce Department and the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The report issued today officially revised the figures.
Productivity, defined as output per hours worked, is considered a key to increasing the nation's standard of living without lifting inflation.
Deborah Klein, a spokeswoman for the Labor Department division that releases the figures, said she could not recall such a mix-up in economic statistics in the 25 years that she had worked with the figures.

Income Slides At Woolworth

 BODY:
Citing lower than expected revenues in all but its German operations, the Woolworth Corporation said yesterday that first-quarter net income dropped 65.8 percent, to $13 million, or 10 cents a share, from $38 million, or 29 cents a share, in the comparable quarter last year.
The New York-based retailer said revenues rose 2.4 percent, to $2.12 billion in the period that ended April 27, from $2.07 billion the year before. Domestic revenues rose 2.5 percent, and foreign revenues increased 3.9 percent. Specialty store revenues increased 6.3 percent while general merchandise revenues remained essentially unchanged. 
 "The recession continued to hurt our operations in North America, especially in Canada, where same-store sales of our Woolworth and Kinney subsidiaries were down 15 percent," said Harold E. Sells, Woolworth's chairman and chief executive officer.
Company-wide operating profit declined 46 percent, to $49 million, from $91 million in the 1990 quarter. Specialty store operating profit declined to $24 million from $53 million, mainly because of the weak performance of the company's non-athletic apparel and Kinney shoe stores.

HEADLINE: Excerpts From the Bush News Conference on Foreign and Domestic Issues

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from President Bush's news conference in Washington yesterday as supplied by Reuters:
 
OPENING STATEMENT
It is with a great sense of pride -- genuine pride in his accomplishments -- and long years of dedicated service to his country, that I announce that Bill Webster has informed me of his intention to retire as the Director of Central Intelligence. Bill will be leaving Federal service after 26 years on the Federal bench as Director of the F.B.I. and as Director of the C.I.A. And as a former D.C.I., I know the complex organizations and inter-relationships that comprise our intelligence community. 
 Bill has brought an integrity, an effectiveness, and an insight to the many intelligence-gathering operations of this nation. He has done a superb job. A strong nation requires a strong intelligence organization, and Bill Webster has directed our efforts according to the guidelines that I set down at the beginning of this Administration, that the C.I.A. would have the single mission of providing intelligence to the policy makers of this government. And he's performed admirably. And that is a very important point. Intelligence not trying to shape policy.
There are those who think C.I.A. should have a different role, but I believe Bill Webster has demonstrated the value of an intelligence organization that is professionally directed and purposely committed. It is invaluable in defending the security of America.
I noticed what one of our coalition partners said -- the dependence on United States intelligence in the recent war. In so many ways he has performed with great distinction and the best -- the best -- in the sense of service to his country. And I hate to see him go. This was his choice, but I offer him my thanks, and I offer him the thanks of a very grateful nation, as he finishes this distinguished career in government and considers other avenues. And he can say a few words now, and then I'll be glad to take just a few questions. Director, we're going to miss you, pal, but you're not leaving right now. We're not going to let him go.
WILLIAM H. WEBSTER: Thank you, Mr. President. I have many mixed feelings about this morning. There's never an easy time to go, especially when you are working for an organization that you believe in and for people that you believe in. It's been an extraordinary experience to have worked with you, Mr. President. . . . I think I'm leaving you -- I know I'm leaving you -- a healthy organization, one that has had, during the last four years, I think, a good track record for its accountability, insofar as it's possible to be accountable. We have positioned ourselves for the challenges of the 90's, which are different than the challenges of the 80's, and I'm very proud of the performance that the entire community rendered during the Persian Gulf. . . . You hate to leave, but something tells you that it's a good time to leave. I still have my roots in the law, and this gives me an opportunity to pursue other avenues in the private sector. So there you are.

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Successor to Webster
Q. Did this come as a surprise? Do you have a successor in mind?
A. We haven't talked successor -- haven't got anyone in mind, but it did come as a surprise when Bill brought this up to me. He told me this several days ago. And it was his decision. I told him that what I've said -- essentially said here publicly -- and he called in yesterday evening and said he thought we ought to go with this announcement.

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
Health and Schedule
Q. Mr. President, you were described yesterday as elated when you got the news that it was your thyroid, not your heart that was out of kilter. Do you have any plans to adjust your schedule, which we all know is rather grueling for anyone, let alone a 66-year-old?
A. Almost 67. No. They've said that with the thyroid thing that I might not get into as active an athletic regime as I'd like to, and they told me that this morning when I took this -- did this test. But they're elated that they know what caused this fibrillation and that it's curable, and will be cured very soon. But they've asked me just for the next few days to check it a little bit in terms of athletics, not in terms of my schedule here.
Q. But beyond the next few days -- will you be scaling back?
A. No, I don't think so. That's the good news, is that once the thyroid is corrected, that means there's no problem on the heart -- the thyroid connected to the heart bone, you know, and I think it's going to be all right. And they've assured me that it can be O.K. Yes.
 
Position on Brady Bill
Q. Mr. President, the House will begin voting today on the Brady bill or the Staggers bill. Is there any scenario under which you would find yourself being able to support the Brady bill, if, in fact, it is attached to you comprehensive crime legislation?
A. Well, what we've said is, we will consider it if it is attached to the comprehensive crime bill. The important legislation -- the priority legislation -- should be the comprehensive crime bill. And I'm a little discouraged that it has not moved faster. And so I will just stay with that position, that we're opposed to them alone. We'll consider them as part of the comprehensive crime bill.
Q. What's wrong with waiting seven days, Mr. President?
A. Our position on this is so well known, I don't want to take up your time going into it any more. Yes.
 
Baltics and Aid to Soviets
Q. Yes, Mr. President. You've got the Baltic leaders coming in later this morning. What are you going to tell them about your leanings on providing aid to the Soviet Union?
A. Well, I'm going to tell them that we haven't made a decision on that. I'm going to tell them I must comply with the law as it's written. But I will also tell them that we have a strong and I think good relationship with President Gorbachev, and I will tell them that I will be interested in hearing what their problems are. I will tell them that we have never, and will never recognize the incorporation of the Baltics into the Soviet Union, but I will encourage peaceful resolution of these very difficult questions.
Q. Well, your comment about Gorbachev today and a similar one yesterday seem to indicate that you'd like to help him out -- that you might want to work around the edges of that credit worthiness provision in the law.
A. Look, when you look at the accomplishments of Mikhail Gorbachev, they are enormous. And yes, the Soviet Union is fighting difficult economic times, but I am not about to forget history and what he did in terms of Eastern Europe, what he's done in terms of perestroika and glasnost has my respect. And so we will deal with the facts as they come to us, but I don't want to see a breach in a relationship that is very strong, that has served us extraordinarily well in recent times, during the war itself, where for the first time the Soviet Union and the United States worked in sync on those matters, and I give President Gorbachev great credit for that, because he was under some pressures at home.
Q. Well, that sounds like you're not going to turn down his request for help.
A. Well, we have to, as I said the other day, we have to be sure that we abide by the rules, as established -- I think the Agriculture Department has to make certain representations. But look, I've always felt that when people are hungry or in need of support, as it relates to food and nourishment, that we ought to try to help.
 
Travel Policy and Sununu
Q. Mr. President, could you give us an update on your review of the White House travel policy and are you still absolutely firmly convinced that Governor Sununu did not abuse it in any way?
A. Yes. I am convinced of that, and I'm going to have some changes, and I'll announce them soon -- perhaps in the next 48 hours.
Q. Will the travels that were made -- that he took -- be permitted under the revisions?
A. Well, why don't you wait and see, because I don't want to preview it. . . .
 
Keeping Quayle on Ticket
Q. Mr. President, what do you say to the pundits who have suggested that as a result of your health scare over the weekend, you might reconsider keeping Dan Quayle on the ticket next year?
A. . . . I've expressed my support for Dan Quayle. I think he's getting a bum rap in the press, pounding on him when he's doing a first-class job. And I don't know how many times I have to say it, but I'm not about to change my mind when I see his performance and know what he does. And I think it's probably been quite hurtful to him, but he's a man -- strong one -- and in fact, we talked about it a little bit yesterday. And I said, look, keep your head up. You're talking to a guy that went through something like this for about eight years -- maybe not quite as intense. But that goes with the territory. And it's unfair, and it is piling on, and it is beneath the critics to do that at this time, I think. But anyway, it's a question I can't lay to rest. . . .
 
Deal on Hostages
Q. Mr. President, lately we've been hearing a resurgence of questions and increasing credence to these allegations that the Reagan-Bush campaign in 1980 was involved in a political deal to hold off on hostage releases until after the election. And even President Carter, who hadn't said this before, thinks that there should be at least some investigation. Don't you think that with all of these allegations coming from so many different continents and so many questions being raised that at least an investigation would be warranted to lay some of these issues to rest?
A. I think the Congress -- some Democratic members -- are looking at it right now, and that's fine. I can only say categorically that the allegations about me are grossly untrue -- factually incorrect -- bald-faced lies. And I have my schedule out there. I think it was put in the days in question -- was in detail in the paper. And those critics -- those who continue to pass this little word-of-mouth ugly rumor ought to have the decency and the honor to say, this takes care of this question. I'm talking about myself. And I can categorically deny any contact with the Iranians or anything having to do with it. And to assign -- let me give you a little more lecture on this, Rita -- to assign a motive to a person that he'd want to keep an American in prison one day longer I think is vicious, and I really am turned off by this, and I'm disappointed in this Mr. Sick, whoever he is.
Q. Then Mr. President, you wouldn't object then to Congress, if it ----
A. They can do whatever they want. It's been looked at exhaustively. But all I'm talking about -- all I can speak for is my own participation or lack there of. And I think that the people who are making these insidious insinuations ought to have the honor to say, this takes care of it. But that's not the way the rumor will works. Yes.
 
Altering the Quayle Image
Q. Mr. President, . . . to follow up about the Vice President. The confidence you've expressed in him is buttressed by those around the White House here who say he's very much a player. There's strong evidence, apart from what the media may or not write that that confidence is not widely shared among people in the general public, and I wonder, sir, if you have contemplated altering his role, giving him more of a chance to be seen, or anything that might allow him to shake this image that he seems to have ----
A. I'd love to be helpful to him in any way I could in that regard. In my view, he is doing his assignments very well -- Competitive Council, Space Council. He's done a lot of very important foreign travel for me, particularly as it relates to South America. And so I can think of a lot of things that maybe I could emphasize more, because I want to help. I don't like to see somebody unfairly criticized. With me, it's again a question of honor. I don't like it. I see him in action. I know what he's doing. He has been extraordinarily helpful, and I can't ask any more of him. But Brit, if there was something I could do to help, I'd want very much to do it because I have great respect for him.
 
Involvement in Iraq
Q. Final question -- the Iraqis this morning tried to shoot down an American plane. What [inaudible] the United States in that?
A. Well, we're looking into that. Fortunately it didn't hit anybody, and I gathered from the Pentagon that they're not particularly concerned. But we have to look into that.
Q. It seems that more and more the U.S. is going deeper in northern Iraq. Aren't you [inaudible] try and [inaudible]?
A. Well, as you know, I expressed my concern early on that I did not want to get bogged down. But what we're doing is humanitarian. We're getting enormous credit finally -- not that we're in there for credit -- for saving lives and helping innocent victims of Saddam Hussein's brutality. And so you raise a very good question, because I don't want to see us get into a quagmire, get further militarily involved with some permanent presence required. I will be talking to the Secretary General of the U.N. -- I think it's tomorrow, and I would hope that the U.N. could do in the north that which they are doing in the south. This is the last one, then I really do have to go.
 
Attitude on Middle East
Q. Mr. President, can you tell us your feelings now towards the Middle East? You've got Secretary Baker heading back for yet another trip. The Soviet foreign minister Bessmertnykh is going to be there at the same time. Does this signal some sort of breakthrough in the offing -- something that gives you cause for optimism?
A. I wouldn't say breakthrough. I wouldn't say breakthrough. But cause for optimism -- I think there's reason to be optimistic. I won't go into the details right now, because when you're dealing with a situation of this complexity and of this endurance, you have to use some quiet diplomacy, which Secretary Baker is very effectively using. But I saw after his last trip some very quite negative reports, and I don't think it's negative. I think there's still a real opportunity here and I don't say that just wishfully. I say it after talking to him and talking to some leaders around the world. So, I'd like to say optimism. But I don't want to go overboard on it, because there's still a complex problem.
Q. There are some who think that you may be being mislead and they cite for proof of that that actions such as the Israelis continuing to establish settlements, that people may be telling the Secretary one thing but either unable to deliver or actually not telling the truth about their intentions.
A. As we know, these differences have gone on for a long, long time, and I don't think that's the case, that somebody's saying one thing and then going off and, you know, just doing something behind his back. But -- no, it's complex. But I don't accept that criticism. There's plenty of room to critique this and to wish for more progress from one country or another. But there's a lot going on and I want to stay involved myself. I want to be a part of this, because I think we have an opportunity now. And I think countries that the United States has helped recognize that, and I think Israel understands that. I think the Saudis understand that. I think the Egyptians understand that. And so I want to use that good will to further peace in the Middle East. And so I'm -- put it this way -- moderately optimistic. Thank you all very much.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Newspaper Ads, for Newspapers

BYLINE: By ALEX S. JONES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: VANCOUVER, British Columbia, May 8

 BODY:
The newspaper industry ended its annual convention here today by announcing a national multimedia advertising campaign to promote a product that has rarely been effectively advertised: newspapers themselves.
"Go on the offensive and holler!" Donald F. Riesett, vice chairman of W. B. Doner & Company, the Baltimore ad agency that created the campaign, exhorted the American Newspaper Publishers Association. The association's 1,400 members include most of the daily newspapers in the United States and Canada. 
 Mr. Riesett said the campaign was intended to reverse the image of newspapers as old-fashioned, and tout the advantages of advertising in newspapers. He pointed to campaigns by television, radio and magazines that try to portray newspapers as out-of-date.
Like true believers at a revival, the publishers cheered such ads as one that read: "Some car dealers love to see themselves on TV. Others love to see a lot of buyers in their showroom," followed by the campaign's tagline: "Newspaper. The best way to close a sale."
The campaign, which will begin this month, includes a $500,000 budget for placing ads in advertising and marketing trade publications and a commitment by 15 major metropolitan papers to bear the cost of repeatedly publishing the ads in their own pages.
In addition, the ads will be distributed by direct mail, and camera-ready newspaper ads, radio spots and videotapes will be provided to all newspapers at a modest cost so they can localize the campaign in their own markets.
The advertising agency had recommended a $5 million campaign that would have included national television and billboards, but that approach was deemed too expensive for an industry looking for every opportunity to trim costs.
The promotion effort comes as newspapers are suffering through what many here say is the worst advertising recession in memory.
The association reported that newspapers accounted for 24.9 percent of the $129 billion spent on advertising in 1990, which meant newspapers retained their longstanding place as the largest advertising medium, followed by television with 22.2 percent.
But the newspaper share of the total advertising pie was down from 26.1 percent in 1989, and the decline has only intensified the anxiety among publishers.
Indeed, this year's convention has been unusually serious. Its theme was "reinventing" the traditional local daily to prosper in a dauntingly competitive world.
"There has been very much less sizzle and much more on operations," said Richard T. Schlosberg 3d, group vice president for newspapers for the Times Mirror Company.
But the nation's 1,611 daily papers, each with its own quirks and procedures, have a history of talking about change without following through.
For instance, retailers like K Mart, which advertise in many markets and are newspapers' most important customers, have long complained that the industry should standardize certain procedures and forms to facilitate buying space.
In 1986, for instance, the association adopted a standard advertising invoice format and loudly predicted its universal use by 1988. But a majority of papers still do not use the format, or use it incorrectly.
 
Symbol in an Invoice
 The failure to adopt the standardized invoice "has become a symbol of newspaper inertia to our best customers," said Ann C. Hunt, a vice president of the Newspaper Advertising Bureau, an industry support organization.
There are signs that this time, the industry will rouse itself, if only because it has no choice.
"We're not alarmist to say that the retail-newspaper partnership may be up for grabs," Ms. Hunt warned.
After years of discussing the need for a mechanism that would allow advertising agencies to buy advertising at many newspapers through a single centralized computer system, such a system now seems a near reality.
A rapt audience of publishers watched wall monitors today as the new system was put through its paces and, in minutes, was used to plan a hypothetical $75,000 advertising campaign in four cities. Under the system, which is still being refined, the entire campaign could be ordered with the push of a button.
But, once again, the success of such a system will depend on whether most of the nation's newspapers will provide data and follow procedures in the standardized fashion that such a computerized system requires.
Jerry Tilis, vice president for marketing at Knight-Ridder Inc., who has headed the project, said that without broad industry support, "we will end up with a technological success and a marketing failure."

HEADLINE: Insurer Pays Price for Risk Strategy

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 8

 BODY:
Like its crosstown rival, the First Executive Corporation, the First Capital Holdings Corporation of Los Angeles built itself into a major life insurance company by investing heavily in high-risk "junk bonds," and like First Executive, whose Executive Life insurance subsidiaries were seized by regulators last month, First Capital is now paying the price for that strategy.
Rocked by defaults in its junk bond portfolio, the Los Angeles-based First Capital reported a $24.7 million net loss in the fourth quarter. Its claims-paying ability has been downgraded by ratings services. Its stock price has slid from $26 four years ago to $1.50 at the close on the New York Stock Exchange today. 
 This week, with concern rising among regulators about the company's ability to withstand further junk bond losses, the California insurance comissioner, John Garamendi, has been putting pressure on First Capital's largest shareholder, the American Express Company, to replenish the financial reserves of the First Capital Life Insurance Company, the largest operating subsidiary.
 
Profitable on Operating Basis
 First Capital so far does not appear to be nearly as weakened by its junk bond losses as First Executive and Executive Life were, analysts said, and there is no indication that any move by regulators to seize its operating units is imminent. Aside from the losses it has had to recognize on its junk bonds, the company still seems to be profitable on an operating basis.
Perhaps most important, it has one thing Executive Life did not: a well-financed backer in the form of American Express, whose Shearson Lehman Brothers subsidiary owns 28 percent of First Capital Holdings.
The most immediate threat to First Capital and First Capital Life may be one of consumer confidence. As questions have grown about First Capital Life's finances, there has been an increase in the number of customers cashing in policies or taking out loans against them. A spokesman for First Capital Life said the number of policy surrenders and withdrawals was up, but that it was "certainly at a manageable level." He declined to provide specifics.
 
An Aggressive Founder
 First Capital Holdings is largely the creation of an aggressive investor, Robert I. Weingarten, who saw a carefully selected portfolio of junk bonds as a way to generate high returns that would fund the competitive rates the company would offer consumers on insurance policies and other investments.
Mr. Weingarten, who resigned as chairman and chief executive on March 15, followed a strategy similar to that used by Fred Carr, the former money manager who built Executive Life into one of the nation's largest insurers.
Mr. Weingarten, a former stockbroker, analyst and magazine publisher, founded First Capital Holdings in 1984. The company grew dramatically, reaching $9.7 billion in assets at the end of last year, $4.1 billion of it in the First Capital Life Insurance subsidiary and $4 billion more in another insurance subsidiary, Fidelity Bankers Life Insurance of Virginia. Both companies primarily sell interest-earning life insurance policies and annuities.
 
$500,000-a-Year Pact
 The whereabouts of Mr. Weingarten, who had previously said that his departure from the company was unrelated to its financial problems, could not be determined. Mr. Weingartern, who is 49 years old, will continue to be paid $500,000 a year through 1997 under a consulting agreement with First Capital Holdings. First Capital Holdings executives did not respond to an interview request.
First Capital is now being run by Gerry R. Ginsberg, the president and chief operating officer.
It is unclear how much money Mr. Garamendi wants American Express to inject into First Capital Life. Mr. Garamendi said on Tuesday that the regulators would "continue to closely monitor First Capital, and will take any action necessary to protect the interests of policyholders."

HEADLINE: Bush Is Leaning To Food Credits For the Soviets

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 8

 BODY:
With the United States and the Soviet Union seeming to move toward another summit meeting, President Bush hailed the accomplishments of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev today and indicated that he was inclined to find a way to satisfy the Soviet leader's request for emergency aid to buy American food.
"When you look at the accomplishments of Mikhail Gorbachev, they are enormous," Mr. Bush said at a White House news conference, going out of his way to praise the Soviet leader. "And yes, the Soviet Union is fighting difficult economic times. But I am not about to forget history. And what he did in terms of Eastern Europe, what he's done in terms of perestroika and glasnost, has my respect." 
 In Moscow, Prime Minister Valentin S. Pavlov said that if the West was truly interested in the success of economic reforms in the Soviet Union, it could not take a "wait and see" attitude toward providing aid. [Page A12.]
 
Ties Seems to Improve
 Developments in recent days suggest that Soviet-American relatons are improving again after a period of coolness that began when Eduard A. Shevardnadze resigned as Foreign Minister in December and Moscow cracked down violently against independence movements in the Baltic republics.
An implicit deal seems to be in the making in which Mr. Gorbachev will satisfy American concerns about the conventional arms treaty, Mr. Bush will help him with more economic aid, and they will both agree to hold a summit meeting in June or July, when they will focus on the still uncompleted strategic arms reduction treaty.
Mr. Bush, in a meeting today with Baltic leaders, was quoted by his visitors as speaking freely about his coming meeting with Mr. Gorbachev, although arrangements have not been completed.
In addition, reports from Moscow indicate that Parliament this weekend may pass a law lifting legal barriers against travel abroad, something long demanded by the United States before remaining trade barriers can be removed.
In discussing the Soviet request for additional credits to buy more American grain, Mr. Bush said, "I've always felt that when people are hungry or need support as it relates to food and nourishment that we ought to try to help."
 
Still Undecided on Method
 But Mr. Bush quickly went on to say that he had still not decided how to respond to Mr. Gorbachev's appeal for the United States to guarantee up to $1.5 billion worth of commercial bank loans by the Soviets to purchase American grain -- largely because by law the Administration cannot extend more such guarantees unless the Soviets are deemed a credit-worthy borrower, which they no longer are by the international banking community.
Administration officials said, however, that the President has asked his aides to look for alternative ways to extend food aid or technical assistance to the Soviets and that this was now being explored by a variety of departments.
Mr. Bush's lavish praise for Mr. Gorbachev today, and his strong hint that he would provide some sort of economic help, were in marked contrast to his public position last week. He said then that "regrettably" the Soviets could not meet the requirements of credit-worthiness, and he left the impression that as a result no American help would be forthcoming.
Since then, though, Mr. Shevardnadze met with Mr. Bush on Monday and appealed for help. And Mr. Gorbachev agreed Tuesday to send the Soviet Chief of Staff, Gen. Mikhail A. Moiseyev, to Washington next week to try to resolve the last disputes over the treaty limiting conventional forces in Europe.
 
$1 Billion Used Up
 The Soviets have virtually used up all of the $1 billion in credit guarantees that Mr. Bush granted them through the Commodity Credit Corporation in December to buy grain to get them through the winter. With Washington guaranteeing the loans, the Soviets could not only get them from commercial banks, which would not normally lend them money, but also get a better interest rate.
Mr. Gorbachev's reason for seeking more help and the Administration's inability to give it automatically have to do with several factors that have developed since December.
First, the United States farm bill that went into effect in 1991 tightened up the conditions for agricultural credits by stipulating that the Secretary of Agriculture had to be able to affirm that a country receiving such benefits could service its debts.
Second, with the Soviet foreign debt now $60 billion and rising, Moscow has become less able to repay many of its commercial lenders, and is now in arrears.
Third, last fall, when the Soviet winter grain crop was being planted for harvesting this spring, its economy was experiencing widespread dislocations, with shortages of seed, fertilizer, tractors, fuel and workers prepared to do their jobs properly. Administration experts are predicting not only a poor Soviet harvest this spring, but also a poor spring planting, which will reduce the fall harvest needed to take the Soviets through next winter.
The impulse to help Mr. Gorbachev is not simply motivated by his cooperative behavior in Eastern Europe and in the Persian Gulf, officials say, but also by the feeling in Washington that he is making a real push to complete the conventional and strategic arms control treaties, which the Administration is eager to lock in.
Administration officials say they are also inclined to help Mr. Gorbachev because if they do not, there could be more serious upheavals in the Soviet Union this year, which could spill over into Eastern Europe.
At the same time, extending new food credits to the Soviets is viewed by some in the Administration as the equivalent of giving drugs to an addict, since it is increasingly clear that the Soviet leader is either unable or unwilling to adopt the real free-market economic reforms that might one day make such credits unnecessary.
Among the alternative approaches being considered would be for the President to extend bank loans or food aid under his discretion to meet humanitarian disasters, although this would require declaring a disaster in the Soviet Union, which would be complicated.
Another option is to use the up to $300 million in credits that could be secured through the Export-Import Bank. A third option, already in the works, is to send a team from the Department of Agriculture this month to advise the Soviets on how to reorganize their farm distribution system. Another possibility is to make grain available on concessionary terms through Public Law 480.
After his news conference, Mr. Bush met for 40 minutes in the Oval Office with President Vytautas Landsbergis of Lithuania, Prime Minister Ivars Godmanis of Latvia and Prime Minister Edgar Savisaar of Estonia. This marked the sixth time he has met with Baltic leaders in the last year.
Mr. Godmanis, speaking to reporters after the meeting with Mr. Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, said Mr. Baker had suggested that the Baltic republics try to establish their independence from Moscow in ways "which also save face for the Soviet Union."

Toys 'R' Us Sales Results

 BODY:
Toys "R" Us Inc., the nation's largest specialty toy retailer, said yesterday that sales at its domestic stores open at least a year fell 4.7 percent in the first quarter.
The retailer said its overall sales, which include those from newer stores, rose 9 percent, to nearly $1.03 billion, from $944.8 million in 1990's first quarter. 
 Securities analysts and investors consider sales from stores open at least a year, known as same-store sales, to be the best measure of a retailer's performance. Newer stores tend to have extraordinarily strong sales.
Many American retailers have seen their same-store sales fall or remain level because of consumer worry about unemployment and the economy. Toys "R" Us had reported a drop in same-store sales during the Christmas shopping season. The company, based in Paramus, N.J., said it would release first-quarter earnings on May 20.

HEADLINE: C.I.A. in Search of a Role

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 8

 BODY:
With his retirement as the Government's chief spymaster, William H. Webster leaves the Central Intelligence Agency with its image and internal controls on misdeeds visibly stronger, but with its own destiny muddled and its performance in the Persian Gulf crisis under a cloud.
 Charting a new role in a world no longer chilled by the cold war will be the overriding task of his successor, and Mr. Webster's own difficulty in doing so may be one reason that he is leaving. President Bush announced Mr. Webster's decision today but did not name a successor. 
 When Mr. Webster came to the intelligence agency in 1987, on the heels of William J. Casey and the Iran-contra affair, the situation in American intelligence was the opposite. The agency was swamped in scandal over secret arms sales to Iran and the Nicaraguan rebels but nevertheless driven by a single cause: the defeat of America's archenemy, the Soviet Union and its proxies in the third world.
Mr. Webster's greatest accomplishment, Administration experts agree, was his restoration of public trust in American intelligence after the political and policy debacle of the Iran-contra scandal.
"The Agency was perilously close four years ago to sliding back into the public image of the 'rogue elephant,' " Bobby Ray Inman, a former Deputy Director of the C.I.A. and an intelligence adviser to Mr. Bush, said today. "The first and foremost job that Webster did, and at a critical time, was to arrest that and get the presumption back to reality."
Mr. Webster imposed strict controls over secret operations like the Iran-contra arms sales, and he disciplined several lower-ranking agency officials involved in the sales. Those public actions reassured a suspicious Congress and raised morale in the intelligence agencies, where advocates of the C.I.A's involvement in the affair were a minority.
But as morale and direction improved within the intelligence agency, the collapse of the Soviet military and ideological threat in 1989 and 1990 suddenly deprived the agency and its brethren organizations of the purpose that drove them for four decades. And while Mr. Webster made a mark in restoring the heart of American intelligence to its proper place, he leaves it without its old soul.
 
Unprepared to Deal With Peace
 "We set up an intelligence apparatus in the 1940's for a specific purpose, to monitor a military and political challenge from the Soviet Union," said one former intelligence official who spoke on condition of anonymity. "When we were planning to meet this challenge, our assumption was that it would come in the form of war. But it didn't; it came in the form of peace. And we are basically unprepared to deal with it."
Agency officials argue that the organization under Mr. Webster has been planning for years for a world without a preeminent Soviet threat. Although critics such as Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, have argued otherwise, some evidence supports the officials' assertion.
Five months after Mr. Webster took office in 1987, for example, the agency sent President Ronald Reagan a classified report entitled "Eastern Europe: Impact of Gorbachev's Agenda on Stability," which predicted outright that Soviet political and economic reforms taking place under Mikhail S. Gorbachev would infect the old East Bloc, producing a political upheaval within several years.
 
Speed of Change a Surprise
 Similarly, the agency sent Mr. Bush a 1989 classified report that predicted increased economic crisis and political instability within the Soviet Union and its ethnic republics as Mr. Gorbachev's policies unleashed national aspirations and demand for goods that even the Soviet leader's reforms could not accommodate.
Mr. Webster since has acknowledged in interviews that the intelligence agency did not anticipate the speed or sweep of those upheavals, but that he believes its assessments were generally accurate.
In recent months, Mr. Webster has come under fire from some in Congress who have complained that he has not offered a dynamic plan to reshape American intelligence for a post-cold war world. Both the House and Senate intelligence committees are now studying legislation that would impose new orders on the $30 billion-a-year intelligence establishment.
Mr. Webster's supporters say that he sought to outline new roles for the intelligence agency, even before the Soviet Union's difficulties. Mr. Webster set up a Federal counter-terrorism center to coordinate American and foreign intelligence on global terrorism and a second center to integrate intelligence and law-enforcement efforts against narcotics producers and traffickers.
More recently, he has publicly advocated collecting more intelligence on foreign threats to the American economy, such as companies that steal American trade secrets and governments that use espionage to learn about American economic strategies.
But such new roles have been unpopular among some intelligence officials, who question the agency's involvement in law-enforcement missions or the practicality of using economic intelligence on foreign rivals to benefit American companies.
 
Challenge Facing Successor
 Whoever succeeds Mr. Webster must quickly resolve those differences and convince Congress that the agency and other espionage agencies have compelling missions to perform in the absence of a serious threat of global war.
The task is made doubly hard by Congress's own skepticism about the ability of American espionage agencies to provide accurate and farsighted information about either its enemies or its friends.
Congress's faith has been shaken by predictions in such hot spots as Afghanistan, where the C.I.A. and many other agencies forecast in 1989 that the nation's Soviet-backed regime would collapse within weeks after Moscow withdrew its troops. Two years later, the Afghan Army has grown stronger and has battled United States-backed guerrilla forces to a stalemate.
More recently, some legislators have criticized the agency's analysis of intelligence on Iraq and its president, Saddam Hussein.
Less than a year before Iraq invaded Kuwait last August, C.I.A. analysts forecast incorrectly that Mr. Hussein would shy from military adventures in order to rebuild his nation's economy after an eight-year war with Iran.
Analysts in serval intelligence agencies were also slow to conclude that Iraq's buildup of forces at the Kuwait border would lead to an invasion, and virtually no one foresaw that he would seize all of Kuwait and precipitate an international crisis.
Many experts in the estabishment complain that such failures are rooted in the C.I.A.'s 20-year emphasis on satellites and other technical wizardry to collect intelligence rather than on traditional spies who collect information firsthand and up close.
 
Traditional Role Stressed
 "Largely speaking, in broad parts of the world we're interested in, we have no special sources, no particular or unique sources of information," said one former Congressional intelligence expert who spoke on condition of anonymity. "If you expect our clandestine services to have recruited lots of people in the Politburo, then we're a failure."
Mr. Webster's associates say that he has made major efforts within the agency, amid resistance from some officials, to stress the traditional espionage of individual agents abroad. He has also intensified the agency's language training and begun to aggressively recruit ethnic minorities and technical specialists, a departure from the spy of agency lore, who was a white, male, Ivy League-educated expert in the liberal arts.
Because recruiting, training and placing agents takes years, the real fruits of Mr. Webster's effort will not be seen until the next century.

HEADLINE: Mail-Order Sales Tax Upheld in North Dakota

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 8

 BODY:
In a decision that could substantially aid small merchants and state treasuries, the North Dakota Supreme Court decided late Tuesday that out-of-state telemarketers and mail-order houses must start collecting a 5 percent sales tax on purchases by North Dakota citizens and sending it to the state.
The case, believed to be the first in which a state's highest court has ruled directly on this issue, challenged the landmark 1967 National Bellas Hess decision in which the United States Supreme Court barred states from collecting sales and use taxes from out-of-state marketers. It was brought against the Quill Corporation, an Illinois-based seller of office products, by Heidi Heitkamp, North Dakota's tax commisioner. 
 The court, citing technological advances and mail-order growth during the last quarter-century, found that "the economic, social and commercial landscape upon which Bellas Hess was premised no longer exists, save perhaps in the fertile imaginations of attorneys representing mail-order interests."
This is a longstanding controversy, one that has turned on the question of physical presence. Ms. Heitkamp contended that not only does Quill use sophisticated equipment to market its goods in the state but also distributes 24 tons of catalogues and brochures each year that wind up in state landfills.
The decision in Bismarck is thought unlikely to have much practical effect until it is upheld on appeal. But if the United States Supreme Court agrees, "out-of-state direct marketers no longer will enjoy an unfair competitive advantage against Main Street America small businesses through the avoidance of $2.9 billion in state and local tax collections," asserted the Coalition for Fair Collection of Interstate Sales Taxes, a group of business and labor interests allied with North Dakota.
Citizens of North Dakota, the most rural of the states, rely heavily on mail-order houses, which now account for 15 percent of national retail sales.
Duane Benton, tax commissioner of Missouri and chairman of the Multistate Tax Commission, a group of 32 states that have led the legal challenge to the mail-order tax exception, said, "Local businesses in every state with a sales tax will benefit from this decision, which recognize the facts of life about the modern American retail market."

HEADLINE: Excerpts From Dinkins Speech: 'Our Difficult Journey Ahead'

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from an address last night by Mayor David N. Dinkins, as recorded by The New York Times.
Good evening, everyone. Tonight I want to talk to you about events of the past few days that touch upon the heart of our fiscal health. I want to talk to you about our difficult journey ahead and about the choices facing all of us who care about this city. And I want to reaffirm my staunch and deep belief that despite our problems, for this greatest of all cities the greatest days still lie ahead. 
 Last Saturday an extraordinary meeting took place at Gracie Mansion. I called together a diverse group of New Yorkers -- elected officials, leaders of business, labor, the Municipal Assistance Corporation and the social service community -- all joined in a common bond, believing in our city and wanting to secure the best New York has to offer for all of our people.
I shared with each of them some very painful decisions that I have had to make for the coming fiscal year. And I asked each and every one of them to work with me to ease the pain of this tight budget. They will be responding in weeks to come -- specifically, compassionately and even bravely. . . .
During the past few months I've had to make some of the most difficult decisions of my career, decisions affecting every single New Yorker. . . . While it has not been an easy time for any of us, we have taken the actions required to regain our fiscal health. Since taking office, my administration has had to cut spending in nearly every agency, raise taxes and weigh every service on a new scale of priorities. The conditions we have faced have stretched the imagination and tested the character and soul of our city.
And we have accomplished a great deal.
 
Budget on Friday
Since I took office we have had to close nearly $8 billion in budget gaps. That's a larger deficit than any prior mayor has had to confront in a full four-year term. This Friday we will be releasing our budget for the next fiscal year and our plan for the next four years. The facts are starkly, undeniably clear. We will grapple with nearly $4 billion in shortfalls for the next 14 months -- at the same time that New York State must come to grips with a $6.5 billion shortfall. . . .
Like most cities throughout the region and the nation we are faced with a kind of continuing, grinding financial squeeze and regrettably the only solutions available will be felt in one way or another by everyone of us.
Most New Yorkers, especially older New Yorkers like myself, remember the city's fiscal crisis 15 years ago as though it were yesterday. . . . Let us never lose sight of the fact that there is a fundamental difference between then and now. The fiscal crisis of the mid-70's was precipitated by financial gimmicks and budgetary tricks. The fiscal challenge today is largely the direct result of a failing national economy. The national recession is real in New York, and it has deprived us of both dollars and hope. We simply do not have the resources to pay for what we need, and our city, like every urban center in our country, has been abandoned in the past decade by the Federal Government.
If the Federal Government had maintained the level of aid it gave New York City 10 years ago, our operating budget would have received an additional $1.2 billion. In addition to that, over $2.5 billion in housing money would have enriched our capital construction plan. Now we must solve problems that have jolted our nation. Our Federal Government stopped building housing, and homelessness has swept across our land. We battle crack and crime, a failing infrastructure, an AIDS virus that has killed more people than the Great Plague. Our current situation is not one that we have created. We are paying the price of inequities in state aid and of money not saved during better times. Washington let us down and then left us with the recession. . . . We will achieve nothing by pointing fingers or assigning blame.
 
'Our Future Health'
As New Yorkers we cannot quarrel about the past and the present or we are sure to lose the future. The answers to our problems are clear. We are the participants who must shape the solutions. . . .
It is, however, only a small down payment toward our future health. A budget gap of over $3.5 billion for the next fiscal year remains. Indeed, our shortfall is so large that we have met with the Governor, state legislators, the City Council, municipal labor unions and the Municipal Assistance Corporation to ask them for help. And unless we receive this critical assistance, we will have to cut essential services by almost $1.5 billion in a single year.
To make reductions of this size is a drastic, almost intimidating, undertaking. But to stop short of that goal of insuring a fiscally sound New York would mean a failure of will, a failure of responsibility, a failure of our city itself. And I do not intend to fail.
Let me outline the choices we have made. Not one of them is pleasant, but without the help of the leaders I have mentioned every one of these cuts will be necessary. I'm ordering city agencies to begin moving ahead with our plan to lay off over 20,000 full-time city workers. As I announced in January, I will recommend to the City Council and to the State Legislature that property and personal income taxes be raised. And most painful of all, under our $1.5 billion service reduction plan we will have to begin a broad-based retrenchment in virtually every critical service this city provides.
We will be dealt some hard blows, but I am certain that in this hour of action we will show our greatest courage. . . . Our entire recycling program will have to be suspended for one year. Our children will lose a treasured experience when we shut the Central Park Zoo. Our streets will be darker since we cannot afford to light all of our lampposts. Our street-cleaning program will be drastically curtailed. . . . For me, this has been a time of reflection. I must say that there is personal sorrow in each of these choices for I have fought for many of these initiatives for years and unless we get the relief that I am seeking, we must begin to dismantle them. But the decisions we had to make, the necessary sacrifices we had to confront, were piercingly clear. As we addressed projected shortfalls for the next four years we have not merely reacted to the crisis, we're several steps ahead. We will have balanced the budget not just for this year, but we will be stabilizing our city's finances for years to come.
 
'I Will Assure You'
At each step along the way we've tried to cushion the blow. Until now we've been able to cut expenses without sacrificing the core programs and services that fuel growth in our communities. We're downsizing city government; I'm reducing the mayor's office by 15 percent; we've consolidated six of our economic development agencies into just two; we have slashed our debt service; we've slashed overtime; we've slashed our fleet of automobiles; we've slashed the salaries of our senior city managers. Sometimes our common goals are derived simply from common sense. In total we have saved $550 million through productivity initiatives. . . . In making these very difficult choices I have tried to preserve programs that affect our most precious resource, our children. Sadly that has not always been possible. But I will assure you tonight, that as soon as our fiscal health improves or if I can secure funding from the other sources that I have consulted, programs will be restored.
Since I dedicated my administration to children, I want to assure you personally that this government will do everything it can to keep our children from harm's way.
We will endeavor to restore prenatal care programs, drug treatment for pregnant mothers and school health clinics. I know the children need nourishment for their minds and bodies, and our libraries and recreational facilities will open again, as soon as additional revenues are at hand. We also want our children to be nurtured by the richness of our cultural life, and I hope I will soon be able to restore funding for these very very vital institutions.
We have fought our hearts out to fund a $1.8 billion six-year criminal justice strategy. Safe Streets-Safe City we call it -- subtitled Cops and Kids, and we will keep that program in place. The battle against violence, lawlessness and drugs will not be short or easy, and I am convinced that if this battle is not won, our poorest, most vulnerable citizens will be hurt most of all.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Our labor unions fight tenaciously for their workers, but we're asking them to think about the impact of these cuts not only on their members but on the sons and daughters that they have and the grandsons and granddaughters of those members. . . . Our business leaders must cope with a great national and local recession, but we're asking them to protect the future of the city that nurtured them by bearing an increased tax burden.

 	 	 		. . .	 	The budget that the State Legislature should have passed in April must be passed by May 25.
This delay has already cost us millions of dollars, and once this budget is approved we ask that they give us our fair share of aid. I'm sure that's clear but let me just say it again: We not only need a budget by May 25, we need our fair share out of that budget.

 	 	 		. . .	 	The choices before us are clear. We can act together making sacrifices and sharing the burden for the good of this city. Or we can go forward with some of the most difficult, painful budget cuts our city has ever had to confront. I am convinced that we will act collectively, not selfishly in this alliance for New York's future, for a cause that is greater than any of our separate interests.

HEADLINE: Dinkins Urges New Yorkers to Ride Out Fiscal Cuts

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
Mayor David N. Dinkins painted a grim picture of a fiscally flattened New York in a somber speech last night that served as his strongest appeal yet for sacrifices from every corner and constituency of the city.
The Mayor announced that the city could close a $465 million budget gap in the last seven weeks of its current fiscal year. But for the longer term, he said, "we simply do not have the resources to pay for what we need." 
 To resolve that problem, Mr. Dinkins affirmed that he would press ahead in his budget proposal to the City Council tomorrow with harsh cuts, some of the worst the city has seen, he said. But then he said not all of this nightmare vision had to come true if all New Yorkers, from municipal workers to business leaders and state officials, would join in making sacrifices.
In doing so, Mr. Dinkins sought to use his public platform and persuasive powers to move large numbers of New Yorkers to accomplish what his administration has so far been unable to do in private talks: agree to address the problems, one way or the other.
"The choices before us are clear," he said. "We can act, together, making sacrifices and sharing the burden for the good of this city, or we can go forward with some of the most difficult, painful budget cuts that our city has had to confront." [Excerpts, page B2.]
With the speech, Mr. Dinkins fell back on a tactic he has used in other pivotal moments in his 16-month tenure, going directly to the public in an effort to quell criticism of his stewardship by confronting it head on and appealing for understanding of his predicament.
The Mayor's speech -- carried live on five television stations and six radio stations with the solemn trappings of a Presidential event -- offered little new substantive information.
The Mayor's aides said they would be able to close the current year's gap by juggling various reserve funds and one-time revenues. For the fiscal year that starts on July 1, Mr. Dinkins vowed to make more than $2 billion in spending cuts to balance the $29 billion budget if he cannot win concessions or aid from the state and the Municipal Assistance Corporation, a state body that was set up to borrow on the city's behalf in the fiscal crisis of the mid-1970's. He has also called for more than $1 billion in higher taxes.
But the remarks were crafted primarily to elaborate on his plea last weekend to municipal labor unions and state officials for concessions and aid to soften the worst of cuts, which would turn off street lights, drain swimming pools, shut homeless shelters, abandon garbage recycling for a year and lay off more than 20,000 workers.
Mr. Dinkins began the half-hour speech by saying flatly that he would make the cuts, then outlined how others could help and by the end made his own conviction clear. "I am convinced that we will act collectively, not selfishly, in this alliance for New York's future -- for a cause that is greater than any of our separate interests," he said.
Unlike the fiscal crisis of the 1970's, Mr. Dinkins said, the city's current problems were not caused by "financial gimmicks and budget tricks" but by the pressures of recession and Federal cutbacks that have "deprived us of both dollars and hope." But that, he said, would pass.
Speaking hoarsely from the effects of a cold in the calm style that is his trademark and wearing glasses to see a Teleprompter, he asked citizens to volunteer to help clean neighborhood parks and streets and to donate time and money to local community organizations that would be hurt by city budget cuts.
He announced that an anonymous donor had offered $2 million to avoid the closing of all 32 city swimming pools, though he said he realized that not everyone could be so generous.
"If others cannot come to the table because of their own constraints, then we can and we must and we will help ourselves in a way that only New Yorkers can," he said, flanked by 18 flags under the crystal chandeliers of the old Board of Estimate chamber on the second floor of City Hall.
"And we'll do it together. For we are New Yorkers, a people with restless dreams and countless hopes, a people who have derived strength from adversity, a people who have always reached for greatness."
 
'Not Going to Stand By'
 City Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone, whose members must pass a budget by June 30, said after the speech, "We're not going to stand by and see essential services decimated." At the same time, he said, the Council will resist the amount of higher property taxes Mr. Dinkins is seeking.
"We have said clearly a long time ago that the days of taxing and spending are over," Mr. Vallone said.
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's press secretary, Anne W. Crowley, said he had not had a chance to listen to the speech, which was not broadcast in Albany, and could not comment on it.
All day, City Hall had an anticipatory air, with television trucks stationed outside and technicians scurrying about, but there was also some sense of skepticism about just what Mr. Dinkins could say that would be new.
In a reminder that not all departments would shrink under the Mayor's cuts (he is hiring thousands of new police officers) and of the oddities of municipal government, police officers from the Technical Assistance Response Unit of the Chief of Detectives' office -- who more often wield cameras and listening devices to help defuse hostage-takings -- were called to install a television link from the second floor to the Blue Room downstairs, to handle overflow crowds of invited guests of city officials and community leaders.
 
'A Tough Town'
 The televised speech evoked an emotional appeal broadcast just 16 years ago this month by Mayor Abraham D. Beame, at the depth of the city's fiscal crisis, in which Mr. Beame warned of the tens of thousands of layoffs he would have to make, complained of a "whispering campaign to denigrate our fiscal integrity" and pledged that New York "is a tough town and it knows how to deal with adversity."
Weeks later, the city was faced with the prospect of immediate bankruptcy, Gov. Hugh L. Carey stepped in to rescue it and by that fall was overseeing its affairs through a special state body, the Financial Control Board.
The control board, now just a watchdog agency, could resume binding powers over the city's spending if the city ended the year with a deficit of $100 million or more or was unable to borrow money in the bond markets. But Mr. Dinkins has pledged to avoid that at all costs, and Mr. Cuomo says his goal is "cooperation, not control."
Mayoral aides said the city could finish closing the gap in the current budget, which they pinpointed several weeks ago after unexpected falloffs in personal-income and sales tax receipts. They would do so with savings from a freeze in purchasing nonessential supplies and other cuts in spending, $50 million from labor reserves, up to $60 million from the sale of a mortgage the city holds on Mitchell-Lama housing, and higher than expected collections in some other taxes and improved tax audits.
 
'Showing Leadership'
 But they acknowledged that if the state did not pass a budget by the end of this month, giving the city anticipated aid, the city could face severe cash-flow problems.
Mr. Dinkins decided to make the speech last Saturday after meeting with union and business leaders, state and city officials and representatives of social-service, parks and cultural groups at Gracie Mansion to outline his proposed cuts.
"I felt that with all of the buzzing around going on, that the Mayor needed to go directly to the public," said Deputy Mayor Bill Lynch, his chief political aide. The strategy "is one that should be used when you have situations like this where the public is concerned," he said. "I think he's showing leadership as he has in the past and he's gotten people's attention."
It was at least the fourth time Mr. Dinkins had taken to the airwaves in a moment of challenge for his administration. The first was just a year ago, when he appealed for racial tolerance in the midst of a black-led boycott of Korean-American grocery stores in Brooklyn and in the Bensonhurst racial murder trial.
The second was last fall, when Mr. Dinkins announced his plan to hire thousands of new police officers and expand the justice system after spending weeks being criticized for not responding forcefully or vocally enough to a highly publicized spate of late-summer crimes. In January, he outlined an optimistic vision for the future in his State of the City address.
 
Final Revisions
 Last night's speech was drafted by Mr. Dinkins's principal speechwriter, Maria Laurino, and worked over by deputy mayors and other aides. Late yesterday, Mr. Dinkins made final revisions himself and then practiced delivering it using the Teleprompter.
First Deputy Mayor Norman Steisel said the point was to prepare the public for pain but also "to remind people that the city has always turned around and there's no reason it shouldn't now" and that the problems were the result of precipitous declines in the city's tax revenues, "as opposed to the impression that seems to be forming in some people's minds that this is poor management at City Hall."
But the City Council President, Andrew J. Stein, who has said he may challenge Mr. Dinkins for the mayoralty in 1993, said: "If we had confronted these problems eight months ago, and the Mayor hadn't granted raises to unions, the public wouldn't be facing this situation now. This is the 11th hour. This is very late in the game."

HEADLINE: A Moving Call to Arms, Or Too Little, Too Late?

BYLINE: By FELICIA R. LEE

 BODY:
Mayor David N. Dinkins's appeal to New Yorkers last night to make sacrifices in a time of fiscal trouble was praised by many city leaders invited to hear it as an eloquent call to arms. But City Council leaders derided the Mayor's plea as too little, too late, and two key labor leaders, while praising the speech, said they were not ready to give Mr. Dinkins what they would call concessions.
Elected officials as well as civic, religious and labor leaders crowded into the public hearing room at City Hall to hear Mr. Dinkins's televised speech, and most gave him high marks afterward. They said the Mayor did a good job articulating the scope of the city's problems in plain but passionate terms. 
 "I thought the Mayor was somber, eloquent and strong," said the Rev. Herbert Daughtry, the pastor of the House of the Lord Pentecostal Church in Brooklyn and a civil-rights advocate. "It was as though he stepped forward and said, 'I've got a painful job to do and I'm going to do it.' "
The city faces a budget gap of more than $3.5 billion in the fiscal year that begins in July, and city officials have ordered reductions in virtually every critical city service.
 
Another Message
 In a speech that outlined a broad swath of cost-cutting measures, including more than 20,000 layoffs, cuts in cultural programs, and the closing of drug-treatment programs and homeless shelters, the Mayor asked New Yorkers to volunteer their services to save the city. Mr. Dinkins said the resolve of ordinary people, coupled with tax increases and the retrenchments he has ordered, would ensure New York's continued pre-eminence.
But the critics in the audience said resolve alone would do little to ease New York's budget woes. They said the Mayor's speech lacked long-term solutions and was not tough enough on pressing the business community to do its part. They also criticized his failure to discuss the impact of the higher personal and property taxes that his administration has requested.
"The Council has a message for the city also," said Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone, whom the Mayor called on in the speech to enact a property-tax increase to raise additional revenues. "And that is we will not allow the decimation of essential city services and we will not allow a tax rate that will cripple the city's economy. We will begin to reshape the budget after we receive it on Friday."
Those who praised the 30-minute speech said the Mayor had succeeded in giving New Yorkers some idea of how they can help, whether it be volunteering at a clinic or library or just making do with less.
"It was a great speech. Inspirational. Well-done," said Barry Feinstein, president of Local 237 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. "We'll do what we can in reviewing the budget."
"I think he had real impact with people who watched him on television," said Stanley Hill, executive director of District Council 37 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. "We must make sure that the children grow up with health clinics, swimming pools, libraries -- all the things I had when I was growing up."
But neither Mr. Hill nor Mr. Feinstein said yesterday that they would ask their memberships to make wage concessions and givebacks previously requested by Mr. Dinkins to reduce the deficit. Mr. Hill said he had a "very productive" three-hour meeting with his membership yesterday, and Mr. Feinstein pledged his help in any way he could.
Some other union officials who campaigned for Mr. Dinkins were left disappointed and upset.
"He's going totally against the entire platform that he won on," said Jimmy Carosella, the president of Local 299 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, which represents Parks and Recreation Department workers, hospital therapists, chaplains and employees at the Department of Cultural Affairs. "He's an embarrassment. I'm really sorry that my local, we backed him, because everything he said he wouldn't do, he's doing."
Geoffrey Canada, executive director of the Rheedlen Foundation, which operates six service centers for children and families in Manhattan, gave Mr. Dinkins's speech a mixed review. He said the Mayor was articulate and compassionate, but failed to conceive a clear role for the unions and for business in sharing the burden.
"I thought the Mayor was truly moved by the pain that the budget cuts were going to bring to the children and families in New York," Mr. Canada said. "But I was disappointed that he was not more explicit in making clear what the other parties who hold the city's future in the palm of their hands could bring to the table."

HEADLINE: U.S. Sees End of Slide In Housing

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 8

 BODY:
The housing slump appears to have bottomed out in much of the nation, the Government reported today.
In the latest sign that sales and values have picked up from a low point at the beginning of the year, a new survey of bank examiners and liquidators shows that residential real estate improved over the last six months in the West, the South and the Midwest. The survey found that even in the Northeast, which is reeling from overexpansion in housing and commercial real estate, more officials saw an improvement than further deterioration. 
 The survey, which will initially be conducted twice a year but may become quarterly, supports anecdotal reports and impressions by real estate developers and brokers that the worst may be over.
 
Other Evidence of Upturn
 It follows other Government and private reports that indicate the markets have begun to improve. On Tuesday the National Association of Realtors reported that home sales picked up for the first quarter of the year by 1.8 percent, to an annual rate of 3.5 million units, although prices continued to stay low compared with those of the 1980's.
And last week the Commerce Department reported that sales of new single-family homes rose in March to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 490,000 from a low of 409,000 in January. Building permits issued for new-home construction, a leading indicator, have also steadily increased since January.
Analysts attributed the increases to the continuing drop in interest rates while prices remain low in many regions.
 
'Turned the Corner'
 "The picture is beginning to become clearer that the housing market has turned the corner," said Mark H. Obrinsky, senior economist at the Federal National Mortgage Association, which provides financing to lenders and did not participate in the survey. "It looks very much like January was the bottom of the residential housing market. We've seen improvements in February and March and although the final numbers have not come in yet, we will probably see an increase in sales in April."
Mr. Obrinsky and other economists predicted that housing prices could begin to increase at the same rate as inflation by the end of the year.
The newly developed index of real estate trends found that more than half the professionals polled across the country said the strongest gains in residential real estate had been in the West, the South and the Midwest. It also found that in the view of the majority of those polled, commercial real estate continued to decline modestly.
The survey was based on questionnaires sent to 500 bank examiners and liquidators from five Federal bank agencies that value and sell real estate. It was created by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which insures the largest real estate lenders, and the Resolution Trust Corporation, which is supervising the bailout of the nation's savings associations and has become the world's largest holder of commercial and residential property. The results of the survey generally conform to the outlook of many private economists and analysts.
Like the widely followed Purchasing Managers' Index, the survey relies on an index calculated from the responses of those polled. An index of more than 50 indicates an improving economic condition, while one below 50 is a sign of decline.
The composite F.D.I.C. real estate index for the last six months through the middle of last month was 61, which was a weighted average of the commercial market index of 47 and the residential index of 70. The index is expected to become more useful once it is conducted over a period of time that will enable trends to be detected.
At a luncheon with reporters, L. William Seidman, chairman of the F.D.I.C. and the trust corporation, said results and trends gleaned from the survey would be used to set discounts and pricing on property held by the Government and to help devise regulations for lenders.
 
'A Reasonable Improvement'
 "People in the field see a reasonable improvement in the marketplace in residential real estate compared to six months ago," Mr. Seidman said. "They don't see it in commercial real estate.
In recent weeks, Mr. Seidman has attributed the weakened condition of the banking industry to changes in the laws that have permitted institutions to make imprudent loans on construction and development projects.
The survey, conducted in the first few weeks in April, also detected strong evidence of a tightening of credit. Almost four-fifths of those questioned found that financing was a problem for "viable" commercial property.
Opinions were more mixed for residential construction lending. Slightly more than a third of the respondents said banks in their area had cut back, and 22 percent reported that banks had become more active. Almost 7 out of 10 polled also said there was too much commercial and residential property on the market.

HEADLINE: Rent Board Proposes Increases of 3% a Year

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
In a move that left tenants' groups unhappy but not as unhappy as landlords' representatives, the New York City Rent Guidelines Board proposed last night that apartment rents rise 3 percent for one-year leases and 6 percent for two-year leases in rent-stabilized buildings.
If adopted, the proposal would be less than last year's rent increases, which were 4.5 percent for one-year leases and 7 percent for two-year leases. 
 More than 900,000 apartments with at least two million city residents are covered by rent stabilization. Public hearings on the proposal will be held on June 18 and 20, and the rates could be revised before a final vote by the board on June 24.
As usual in the annual jockeying over the rent increases, both tenant and landlord groups at the board meeting last night expressed dissatisfaction. But landlords were especially vehement.
"This is one of the most irresponsible government acts I've ever seen," said John Gilbert 3d, president of the Rent Stabilization Association, a building owners' organization.
A study by the staff of the Rent Guidelines Board concluded that actual building operating costs in the 12 months ending in April rose by an average of 5.1 percent. Mr. Gilbert's organization came up with a figure of 7.2 percent.
The city agency's study also projected that in the coming year, operating costs would rise 6.1 to 7.7 percent.
Citing steep rises of about 20 percent in property taxes and water and sewer charges, Mr. Gilbert said many building owners could not make ends meet under the proposed rent increases. He predicted that more buildings would be abandoned by owners.
Another owner representative, Dan Margulies, executive director of the Community Housing Improvement Program, said that without adequate rental income, more owners would default on their property taxes, a result that would only compound the city government's fiscal problems.
But tenant advocates called for no change in rent levels, asserting that building owners have profited from excessive increases in past years.
 
Proposal Approved 5 to 4
 The board itself was sharply divided in last night's voting. It has two members representing landlords, two representing tenants and five designated as "public" members.
After a succession of 10 different rent formulas were introduced and voted down, the board took a recess and returned to adopt the compromise proposal by a vote of 5 to 4.
The regulations apply to leases that are renewed between Oct. 1 of this year and Sept. 30, 1992, said Timothy L. Collins, executive director of the rent guidelines agency.
Oda Friedheim, a tenants' representative on the board, said rents needed to be limited in part because of the economy. "Many tenants are suffering tremendously in the recession," she said. But a member of the audience supporting the landlords shouted, "We're not social workers!" There were occasional catcalls and boos from both sides throughout the session.
While the annual rent increases are being decided, the landlord groups are making their most concerted effort in years to win changes in rent control laws from the State Legislature. Tenant organizations are adamantly opposed to them.

HEADLINE: $4.5 Million Matisse Leads in Slow Sales

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL

 BODY:
The recession in the art market continues, judging by this week's auctions of Impressionist and modern works at Christie's and Sotheby's . A majority of paintings at both auctions sold either well below or right at low estimates, and private buyers dominated the market.
Of the 57 lots sold at Christie's last night, 17 did not find buyers. The sale totaled $23,144,000, well below the presale estimate of $34 million to $47 million. Sotheby's sale on Tuesday evening fared even worse: of the 49 paintings, sculptures and drawings offered for sale, 20, or 41 percent, found no buyers. Even the best-known painting -- "The Persian Robe" by Matisse, which sold for $4.5 million -- went for significantly less than Sotheby's presale estimate of $5 million to $7 million. 
 As was evident at last week's sales of contemporary art at Sotheby's and Christie's, which opened the spring auction season in New York City, selectivity was the buzzword among buyers, who eagerly packed both sales rooms, hoping to cash in on bargain prices. In this week's sales of Impressionist and modern art, auction houses and buyers appeared to be playing tug of war to see just how low prices have to go to make sales, and just how many risks are worth taking.
"Bidding was slow, so slow at times it was almost in reverse," said John L. Marion, the chairman of Sotheby's North America, at the conclusion of Tuesday's auction, where he served as auctioneer.
While both auction houses said they had put what they considered low estimates on the artworks they were selling, those estimates apparently were not always low enough. Sotheby's had estimated its sale would bring $31 million to $42 million, the Sotheby's auction totaled only $18.2 million. In comparison, last year's spring sale brought a total of $286 million, $78.1 million of which went for a single painting, "At the Moulin de la Galette" by Renoir.
Christie's Impressionist and modern sale last May totaled $268.4 million, $82.5 of which went for Van Gogh's portrait of Dr. Gachet. Last night's top lot at Christie's was Magritte's "The Mysterious Barricades," a chilling Surrealist scene that sold for $2,200,000 after a high estimate of $1,600,000, but that was one of the few works that exceeded the estimate. Another was a pen-and-ink drawing by Picasso that sold for $264,000, or $64,000 more than the high estimate.
Last night, rumors circulated that Christie's had urged consignors to lower their reserves in light of Sotheby's sale. "There was a small degree of fine-tuning," said Michael Findlay, who heads the Impressionist and modern department at Christie's. "But by and large the results reflected accurately the works offered, which has not always been true in recent years."
Clearly, times and tastes have changed. One artist whose works did badly both nights was Chagall, a favorite among Japanese buyers. At Christie's, two of the five Chagall's up for sell did not find buyers, including "The Night of Orgeval, which had the highest estimate in the sale. At Sotheby's, only one out of three Chagalls sold.
Looking at the overall picture, Sotheby's admits that it was not easy to obtain artworks for this week's sale. In addition to the climate of recession in the art market, the sale was put together at the height of the war in the Persian Gulf, when few sellers were inclined to trade actively. "We debated and debated about whether to have a sale at all," said Diana D. Brooks, president of Sotheby's North America.
Fortunately for Sotheby's, one big-name estate was available: seven important paintings and drawings, including the Matisse, which had belonged to Irene Mayer Selznick, the Broadway producer known for "A Streetcar Named Desire" who died last year at age 83. She was the daughter of the film producer Louis B. Mayer and the first wife of the producer David O. Selznick.
To secure the property, the auction house followed the now-common practice of offering a guarantee, or a promise of a minimum amount that Mrs. Selznick's heirs would receive from the sale. While the amount of the guarantee was not disclosed, the consensus among experts is that it was roughly 80 percent of the low estimate. If so, the guarantee was met, but narrowly: the total received for the Selznick property was $7.7 million, just meeting Sotheby's low estimate.
 
$1.3 Million for Seurat Study
 Besides the Matisse, another work from the Selznick estate that drew major attention was a study for Georges Seurat's "Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte," which is in the Art Institute of Chicago. It sold for $1,375,000, above the $1 million high estimate.
Also offered for sale was a 1905 Matisse, "View of Collioure With Church," which made headlines several months ago when it was removed from the Museum of Modern Art and sent to Sotheby's as the result of a dispute over its ownership. The painting, which was eventually determined to have been the property of Ariana Rodina Calderone Stahmer of Pennington, N.J., a 6-year-old great-granddaughter of the photographer Edward Steichen, did not find a buyer. Nor did two paintings by Jean Dubuffet that were the property of the Pierre Matisse Gallery, whose collection Sotheby's owns in partnership with the art dealer William Acquavella.
Still, many works seemed out of place in a sale of Impressionist and modern art. Among them were the five Latin American paintings that Sotheby's decided to include rather than holding a separate Latin American auction, as it has done in the past. Of these works, only one sold.
 
A Narrower Market
 "There were a lot of lesser works, the type that would have normally been put in a day sale," said Ann Richards Nitze, an art dealer in New York and Washington. "There were also many more 20th-century pictures." Mrs. Nitze said the sale as a whole did not appeal to the Japanese market. "Japanese buyers tend to gravitate more toward pictures of beautiful women and colorful landscapes," she said.
While the Japanese have not been active buyers this spring, many were in attendance, occupying the front rows, as they often have. "The salesroom looked very much the same, with its standing-room-only, glitzy crowd," said the writer Tom Wolfe. "The adrenaline is still pumping. Maybe people are still coming because they think it's all going to collapse." Actual buyers were primarily private European and American collectors, many of them new to the market, others re-entering after years of not buying.
"It's a much narrower market than we've had in the past," said David Nash, who heads Sotheby's Impressionist department. "This season there was no support at all from the trade." The speculators who epitomized the hyperactive market of the 1980's were missing as well.
One buyer very much in evidence at Sotheby'swas a man who refused to give his name but said he was a private collector based in London. He bought steadily all evening, racking up a bill of more than $4.2 million. "The overall sale was disappointing," he said. "But for me it was an opportunity to make some good purchases. Who knows? I might be wrong. Ask me in three years."

HEADLINE: For the Disabled, Products That Help, but Have Style, Too

BYLINE: By EVE M. KAHN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: EDISON, N.J., May 5

 BODY:
Tom Mullen, a wheelchair designer, fears that neon is losing favor with the California beach crowd.
"The surfers are starting to wear shirts that say, 'No to Neon,' " said Mr. Mullen, whose employer, Quickie Designs in Fresno, Calif., builds wheelchairs with high-speed wheels and neon frames that are used for sports. "We're having trouble picking frame colors for next year, because people in wheelchairs are just like everybody else. They want the very latest." 
 Quickie was one of more than 100 companies that participated in the Abilities Expo here last weekend. The exhibit of products for the disabled attracted parents of infants with severe birth defects as well as elderly paraplegics.
"We're looking for anything that makes life a little easier for us," said Laura Reilly of Basking Ridge, N.J., who attended with her son, Erik, a college student who uses a wheelchair.
She had one complaint: the prices. Marc Friedenthal, a graduate student from Albany who uses a wheelchair, agreed. "Everything's so expensive here," he said. Adapting a home, car or workplace for infirmities may now involve highly sophisticated technology, and that costs more.
Among the most innovative and highest-priced products was the Eyegaze Computer System, which is meant for people with virtually no mobility and costs about $25,000. A lens below the computer monitor follows the user's pupil, and half-second glances at segments of the screen act as commands.
"There are 18 of our systems running now," said Nancy Cleveland, a medical and technical coordinator for the manufacturer, LC Technologies . "There's an 11-year-old kid in Florida doing his homework on one."
For less profoundly disabled people, exhibitors like the J. C. Penney Company offered clothes that are easy to put on. All the buttons on Penney's Easy Dressing Fashions are nonfunctional fronts for Velcro strips, and zippers bear oversized pull-up rings. Most items in the line are $20 to $60.
LJM Products showed a line of housewares, including thick-stemmed wine goblets that are difficult to topple ($5.50 each for glass; $14.95 for acrylic) and a plastic cutting board ($62.50) equipped with a vise that can grip bottles. LJM's heavy utilitarian designs could pass for Danish modern.
"We try for products that aren't so rehab-looking," said Linda Schweighardt, the company's president.
The expo was started 12 years ago in California by Richard C. Wooten, who was partially paralyzed by polio as a teen-ager in the 1950's. This was the expo's first venture on the East Coast, and visitors came from all over. Earl and Lisa Vaught drove up from Luray, Va., where they run a steakhouse. The Vaughts attended with their 7-year-old son, Daniel, who has a motor disorder that prevents him from walking.
"We live in a very rural, economically deprived area," said Mrs. Vaught, who watched her son tap hesitantly at a computer keyboard. "His school got a computer because of our advocacy," she said, "and I'm here to learn what it can do, because no one back home understands its potential."
Nearby, Dennis Fitzpatrick, a 5-year-old with cerebral palsy, was trying out a motorized wheelchair painted in primary colors. Adults were cruising the aisles in high-tech wheelchairs. People riding electric scooters that looked like lawnmowers with seats had to swerve to avoid others in three-wheeled exercise chairs powered by hand pedals.
Parked alongside every aisle were sleek minivans. Sales representatives rolled potential customers in wheelchairs inside, pressed buttons that folded up ramps and closed doors, and then locked the chairs into the seatless driver positions.
"I've never seen anything like this," said Inez Allen, principal of Public School 134 in the Hollis section of Queens. Her wheelchair was ensconced in a van manufactured by Independent Mobility Systems , and she was toying with the hand controls. "This would be so much better than my Toyota," she said. "I could get in and out myself."
The salesman told her the vehicle cost $32,000; she frowned and said she doubted she could afford it. "I really came looking for a scooter," she said.
Mark Malone, a financial analyst from South Bound Brook, N.J., came to the expo in search of ideas. Paralyzed eight years ago in a swimming accident, he wore a T-shirt that read, "I'm Not Paralyzed I'm Just Lazy."
"I'm checking out reactions to the shirt, to see if I should sell ones like it, maybe at the next expo," he said. "And I'm seeing what products are out there, what I could use. I've got a big family, and if I see something I like, maybe a relative could make it for me."

The motorized wheelchair can be controlled by any part of the body.

Withers Stakes Won By Subordinated Debt

BYLINE: By JOSEPH DURSO

 BODY:
Belmont Park rang up the curtain on 66 days of racing yesterday with the 116th running of the Withers Stakes and a rousing victory for Subordinated Debt, a 7-to-1 outsider who outran Scan, Kyle's Our Man and half a dozen other colts with varying designs on the Preakness and other 3-year-old classics.
The performance was an upset in more ways than one. Subordinated Debt had a bleeding problem only two months ago plus a three-race losing streak of convincing proportions. But he still ran a dashing race, outdueled the well-connected Scan in the final sixteenth, won by three-quarters of a length. 
 At the finish, with Julie Krone prompting him home, the 3-year-old bay gelding had the best of Scan, the even-money favorite, who in turn had eight lengths on Kyle's Our Man, next in the betting at 5 to 2. And farther up the track in fifth place came Wayne Lukas's Dodge, another failing candidate for Triple Crown action, who had gone off as third choice at 9 to 2.
Not only that, but Subordinated Debt toted his 126 pounds over a fast track in very fast time, indeed: He went the first three-quarters of a mile in 1:09 3/5 and completed the mile in 1:34, which was one-fifth of a second (or one length) slower than Dr. Fager's stakes record of 1967 and only one second slower than Conquistador Cielo's 1982 track record for the mile.
David Monaci, who trains Subordinated Debt for Leslie R. Grimm, immediately said that his horse had opened several doors, including the Preakness. And this was a horse who had run third (and bled) in the Fountain of Youth Stakes in February, run 11th in the Jim Beam in March and sixth in the Arkansas Derby in April.
"I was a little discouraged because of those last two races," Monaci said. "You try to get them ready and then they fall apart. He even had a little virus. But he's fine now. I want to run him in one more race before the Belmont Stakes, probably either the Jersey Derby, the Preakness or the Peter Pan. It depends on how he comes back."
 
Running Out of Candidates
 Scotty Schulhofer, who once was training three prime Kentucky Derby contenders, conceded that he had run out of candidates. Cahill Road suffered a leg injury while winning the Wood Memorial, and will be retired. Fly So Free ran fifth in the Derby, and will skip the Preakness. And now Scan, a three-time winner at Belmont last fall, ran second in the Withers.
"He just got beat," Schulhofer said.
The Preakness? "Never even thought about it," he replied.
But John Veitch, who trains Kyle's Our Man for Daniel Galbreath, said that the Preakness was still a possibility despite the fact that the colt ran third on the same track where he had won the Gotham a month ago.
"It's disappointing," Veitch said. "He may go to the Peter Pan, it's right here at Belmont. The Preakness is still a possibility. But we'll have to let Mr. Galbreath make that decision."
 
FINISH LINE
 The sun was shining and the temperature was climbing, but only 11,549 persons attended the opening of Belmont after four months of New York racing at Aqueduct. The horses will stay at Belmont for 66 days until July 22, when the action moves upstate to Saratoga for five weeks.
Aqueduct reported some losing numbers, too: The daily average attendance over the 107 days dropped 11 percent to 9,117. The betting handle also dropped 11 percent to $260 million.
"Our business," said Gerard J. McKeon, president of the New York Racing Association, "is a reflection of what's going on across the country and in particular in the Northeast, which is that there is a recession."

HEADLINE: In New York's Crisis: Opportunity

 BODY:
New York City will cobble together a solution to its immediate fiscal crisis; it has little choice. By law, it must balance its budget and will do so with a hotly debated assortment of tax increases and harsh service cuts. But unless the city's leaders use this emergency to pursue fundamental reforms, nothing will change.
The city will remain adrift, at the mercy of the economic tides. New Yorkers, now facing such pain that a solemn Mayor David Dinkins felt compelled to deliver a televised pep talk last night, will suffer even more of it the next time the economy sours. 
 There is an alternative. Under the discipline of crisis, City Hall and the state can make dramatic changes in government. Mr. Dinkins has begun downsizing his administration, to his credit, but there are more far-reaching ways to provide better services with fewer employees and less money. There are no surprises or municipal magic bullets. But a number of responsible reforms could make a powerful difference. They will be hard to achieve. As the Mayor noted last night, however, New Yorkers "are the participants who must shape the solutions."
Shift the local share of Medicaid and welfare costs to the state. New York City would save close to $3 billion a year if New York State took over these costs, shifting the burden of caring for the poor to a broader tax base. Ideally, these health and social services should be a Federal obligation, but there's little chance that Washington will soon accept that burden. A state takeover is the next-best solution.
Reform civil service rules so the city can consider merit when it must lay off workers. The city must now consider only seniority. This change would allow retaining the most motivated -- and productive -- employees.
Use more one-officer police cars. The N.Y.P.D. is alone among the largest police forces in permitting only two-officer cars to respond to 911 calls. Using solo cars in low-crime neighborhoods would free officers for community patrol and could save some hiring costs for the Mayor's anti-crime plan.
Negotiate new rules for trash collection. Sanitation workers are paid for eight-hour workdays but more than half put in four hours or less because of a 1981 agreement made to win union acceptance of two-man crews. The agreement made sense then, but needs modifying now. Just one more hour of work would save $7 million.
Restructure health and welfare plans. These can be designed to provide better benefits for municipal workers at less than the current annual cost of $1.25 billion.
Reform the pension laws. Police officers and firefighters can retire on half pay after 20 years. That's a holdover from the days when age 40 was considered over the hill. There's another expensive provision: a police officer who develops a heart problem, or a firefighter who develops a heart or lung problem, can retire immediately on three-quarter pay because the law presumes that the disability was job-related. Former Mayor Edward Koch failed when he tried to get Albany to modify the "heart bill." Another try is long overdue.
Charge tuition at the City University based on ability to pay. That's a much fairer way to support the university system than the present approach, imposing tuition increases across the board.
Those are some of the more obvious reforms. The city needs cuts and taxes of the kind the Mayor described last night; there's no avoiding the loss of billions in municipal income. But New York can do more than bite the bullet; courageous reforms made under the gun of the crisis can save many billions more, permanently.

Landsbergis for Nobel Laureate

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Through an area under curfew where 66 were arrested the night before; past boarded-up shops, recently looted, with shards of glass cluttering the sidewalk; into the very eye of defiance of authority I made my perilous way to breakfast with Vytautas Landsbergis, President of the Republic of Lithuania.
This was in Washington, D.C., of course, capital of the most stable Government in the world. Did President Landsbergis, who made his stand against Mikhail Gorbachev's black-bereted goons in Vilnius four months ago, feel at home? 
 "Certain similarities exist," he allowed, "but I feel at home in a different sense." Later, he said: "This is the home of freedom. Everybody seeking freedom looks to the U.S."
This modest patriot offers no bombast, no heroic poses; he believes the Baltics are of right independent and ought to be treated that way.
"But the Western democracies speak over our shoulders to the face behind us," he says. "They don't look us in the eye."
Yesterday, in a significant symbolic act, President Bush looked the Balts in the eye, greeting the leaders of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania in the Oval Office.
No longer do we cling to the passive posture of not accepting the Hitler-Stalin conquest. We are step-by-stepping toward outright recognition of the captive states, which infuriates the leftover imperialists in Moscow.
In helping to move Baltic independence from de jure to de facto, Mr. Bush is executing the classic "pushmipullyu maneuver." This involves talking out of heads at both ends of the mythical animal.
Thus from the front head he loudly lauds the "enormous" accomplishments of Mr. Gorbachev, and flashes the signal that $1.5 billion of U.S. taxpayers' money is soon to go down the Soviet command-economy drain to appease the old apparatchiks.
Meanwhile, the back head of Mr. Bush is planning to name Robert Gates (who Mr. Gorbachev thinks is out to get him) as Director of Central Intelligence. That back head also poses for a picture with the Baltic leaders, which helps weaken Moscow's grip on three captive nations.
As further evidence of his back head's iron resolve, Mr. Bush will send Curtis Kamman, a Deputy Assistant Secretary of State (whose protocol seat at a diplomatic dinner is deep in the butlers' pantry) to the Baltic capitals to show the U.S. flag.
Is pushmipullyu diplomacy -- dazzlingly acting against our words -- the best way to achieve our ends? Oval officers love it because historians damnably praise feints. Sometimes two-facedness works, but most of the time it confuses everybody by muddying our purpose.
President Landsbergis, with independence his fixed goal, would prefer us to use our credit guarantees to encourage companies to invest in his country, and to establish a Baltic development bank. Richard Nixon, returning from his Soviet tour, agreed: we should be helping the reforming hands in the republics, not pressing credits into the dead hand of the Gorbocracy.
But the trio of Baltic leaders in the White House yesterday did not presume to advise against our giving billions in baksheesh to a Soviet central Government bankrupted by arms spending; they were grateful for the photo op and eager to develop connective tissue. The steady accretion of foreign recognition is their bloodless road to independence.
Moving beyond symbolism, we should warn the Kremlin that any economic punishment of the Baltics would trigger our counter-coercion. We should also lean on the Soviets to accept the Balts as observers at C.S.C.E. meetings this summer. (Last year the U.S. supinely allowed the Soviets to lock out the Balts.) And next March, at Helsinki II, we should link our attendance to their full participation as European nations.
Momentum is all. Norway's Nobel committee, to make up for its abysmal judgment of the recent past, should restore the luster of the Peace Prize this October by awarding it to Vytautas Landsbergis, symbol of Baltic independence.
That long-overdue return to self-determination by three little nations has always been the key to the relaxation of Soviet internal imperial rule. Keep the heat on; free the Baltics, change the world.

HEADLINE: For Floyd Bennett Field Past Should Be Future

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Contrary to your April 6 article on Floyd Bennett Field in Brooklyn, the abandoned air facility may not need a private developer to make a park of it. In my view, Floyd Bennett should be re-established as an airfield, preferably one that is physically linked to Kennedy International Airport to create a superregional airport. 
 The proximity of Floyd Bennett to Kennedy (five miles) means that they could be connected by a passenger monorail over Jamaica Bay. Floyd Bennett's runways can be used or expanded slightly to accommodate the same kind of aircraft that now use La Guardia, whose runways and land area cannot readily be expanded. The Gateway Park setting could be preserved as part of the overall project. This plan would use Government-owned land, create jobs and help revitalize our local economy, ease traffic congestion on the highways leading to Kennedy, ease air traffic congestion at La Guardia and Kennedy, and promote air traffic safety.
New York City should do everything in its power to restore Floyd Bennett to what it once was: a thriving airfield.

Qualex Chief's Strategy To Beat Photo 'Minilabs'

 BODY:
Although customers of photofinishing labs operated by Qualex Inc. usually wait 24 to 48 hours to get their photos, the company's new president is relatively unconcerned about the proliferation of laboratories that can process film in under an hour.
Peter D. Fitzgerald, who was named Qualex's president and chief executive yesterday, said the company had a strategy that can beat the one-hour laboratories, or "minilabs," at their own game. 
 "We will put our own 'microlab' into a retailer's store at no cost to the retailer," Mr. Fitzgerald said. "They can have 30-minute processing, and the lab takes only one-third of the space of the standard minilab."
Unlike the minilabs, which use on-site machinery, Qualex had used only centralized processing. The company picks up film at an affiliated retail outlet, sends it to one of its 53 laboratories and then returns the finished pictures to the retailer.
The centralized labs are usually cheaper than minilabs. Centralized processing companies also offer a broader range of enlargement and processing services.
Mr. Fitzgerald said Qualex, based in Durham, N.C., controlled about a third of the photofinishing market. "The minilabs have about 25 percent of the market and other laboratories have 75 percent," he said. Qualex, he added, controls nearly half of the centralized laboratory market.
The company was formed in March 1988 from a merger of photofinishing operations owned by the Atlanta-based Fuqua Industries, which owns 51 percent stake in Qualex, and photofinishing operations owned by the Eastman-Kodak Company, which holds a 49 percent share of Qualex.
Mr. Fitzgerald said the company expected to place about 300 of its microlabs into drugstores and grocery stores before the end of the year. Nevertheless, sales should be flat to down. "Volume will be flat this year. And prices are under a little bit of pressure," he said.
Curt Rohrman, an analyst with the First Boston Corporation, said: "We're in a recession, and that is going to affect travel. Anything that affects travel is going to affect photo taking."
Nevertheless, he said, Qualex should not be under increasing pressure from the minilabs. "The minilabs have proliferated to most of the retail outlets where they are likely to go," Mr. Rohrman said. "I don't see much increased growth for them."

Why Some See A Longer Slump

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
IS the recession bottoming out?
The latest survey by Blue Chip Economic Indicators, to be released today, reports that the consensus forecast of the 50 economists polled is that real gross national product, after dropping at annual rates of 1.6 percent and 2.8 percent in the last two quarters, is flattening and will rise slightly -- by six-tenths of 1 percent -- in the current April-June quarter. And a new survey of 500 bank examiners and bank liquidators indicates that the housing slump is ending. 
 Yet, some economists at major banks and industrial corporations contend that the recession is not only still here but is even widening. Joseph G. Carson, the Chemical Bank's chief economist, told the bank's international advisory board earlier this week: "In my opinion, rather than ending, there are more signs that the recession is broadening domestically, encompassing not only the consumer sector but also capital spending and Government spending." Globally," he added, "recessions continue in Canada and the United Kingdom, and early signs of recession are now present in continental Europe."
Mr. Carson's major concern about the American economy is that as a result of the debt buildup of the 1980's and the big rise in interest costs to a record level of 30 percent of cash flow, many concerns have been starved for cash and, even before the recession began last July, had been suffering "profitless prosperity."
Hungry for cash, they have resorted to selling goods at distress prices, liquidating inventories, cutting capital spending and laying off workers and managers. And Mr. Carson sees more adjustments ahead, as profit margins continue to shrink, manufacturers' inventories remain high and, in some retail sectors, order backlogs continue to decline. Also, he said, "export orders may remain soft for several more months."
Mr. Carson also reported on the views of other business economists at last week's meeting in Washington of the technical advisers to the Business Council. "Without exception," he said, there had been a "significant swing" toward pessimism since the economists' mid-February meeting. Auto industry representatives said business was "very soft" with no "signs of a pickup in sales." There were also pessimistic assessments by representatives of the capital goods sector, chemicals, textiles, primary metals and consumer durables.
Yet, Mr. Carson reported, "industry representatives continue to expect a second-half recovery." He suggested that these representatives were guilty of "calendar analysis," based on the belief that because recessions historically have lasted about one year, this one should be over by midyear. But he held that individual recessions vary widely in duration and do not expire because of old age. Rather, he said, they end as business makes its financial adjustments and Government monetary and fiscal policies kick in to lift the economy out of recession.
"How much worse the recession gets," Mr. Carson said, "will depend on the pace at which we can unwind the financial imbalances which triggered this recession and, importantly, the monetary and fiscal policy responses which follow." Those responses up to this point, he argued, have been "at best neutral."
Last fall's budget agreement between the Administration and Congress raised personal taxes by more than $25 billion for 1991, and 26 states increased taxes by $10.3 billion. The Fed has been moving to bring down interest rates, including last week's half-point cut in the discount rate, to 5 1/2 percent, and a quarter-point cut in the target for the Federal funds rate, to 5 3/4 percent. But Mr. Carson held that real corporate borrowing costs had not come down enough.
His conclusion was that the recession would last another five to six months -- but that during that period the roots of recovery, in the form of lower interest rates, would be taking shape, "setting the stage for a solid recovery in 1992 and beyond." Before the recession is over, he is looking for at least one more cut in the discount rate, to 5 percent, and a Federal funds rate of about 5 1/4 percent. He is far from alone in his view that Fed policy should ease further. Richard A. Debs, advisory director of Morgan Stanley International, and a former official of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said the Fed "has leeway now to go further."
And David D. Hale, chief economist of Kemper Financial Services Inc., said that while the economy might be stabilizing, the recovery was likely to be so modest as to have no impact on unemployment or industry's rate of using capacity. "The critical issue," he said, "is the economy's growth rate vis-a-vis the potential growth rate of new supply and the slack created by the recession."
If the second-half recovery is too weak, it will still feel like recession, especially to the jobless, the cash-short and debt-laden consumers and businesses threatened with falling profits or bankruptcy. And there will be a danger of a lurch into a secondary recession in 1992 or '93 -- like the double-dip recession of 1979-80 and 1981-82. A stronger Fed push is still needed.

Santa Anita Sees Odds in Its Favor

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
CLIFFORD C. GOODRICH says his business drew fewer customers this year than last, and he thinks the number will fall off dramatically next year. And those facts are positive, he says.
Mr. Goodrich runs the annual horse racing meet at Santa Anita, the race track in Arcadia, near Los Angeles. In California, the major horse racing tracks are owned by investors. Santa Anita, like its crosstown competitor, Hollywood Park, and Northern California's Bay Meadows, is publicly traded. 
 As Santa Anita sees it, the general decline in horse racing is likely to result in a shakeout in which the strong do better, and Mr. Goodrich thinks that Santa Anita will make the cut. And, he adds, with fewer people attending the races, some parking lots can be closed and developed for other uses.
While spring is the annual highlight of the racing calendar, as the Triple Crown races draw attention from sports fans who otherwise ignore horse racing, this spring has been a glum one. Attendance and betting are down.
"Racing used to be recession-proof and inflation-proof," Mr. Goodrich said in an interview.
In this year's meet at Santa Anita, which began on Dec. 26 and ended on April 22, there was a 4.5 percent decline in attendance, and, perhaps more significant, a 7 percent drop in the amount wagered.
Santa Anita's problems are not unique. At New York's Aqueduct, whose racing season ended this week, betting handle and attendance were each down 11 percent.
Horse racing in California has not been the same since 1985, when that state's lottery began. Suddenly, there was an easier legal way to gamble than going out to the track. But the tracks have fought back, obtaining passage of laws that allow gamblers to bet at their local track on races at other Southern California tracks, as well as allowing some bettors outside the state to bet on California racing.
Revenue from those gamblers is expected to push up Santa Anita's revenue this year, despite the drop in attendance, and to do the same next year even though Mr. Goodrich, the president and chief operating officer of the Los Angeles Turf Club, expects a further decline in attendance, perhaps as much as 25 percent, as more satellite wagering sites go into operation.
But for investors in Santa Anita, horses are not the only story. And it was real estate, the other part of the story, that caused a big fall last year in the value of shares in the two Santa Anita companies, which trade in a pair. A stock buyer gets shares in two companies: the operating one that owns the Los Angeles Turf Club, which runs the races, and the real estate investment trust, which owns the track and a lot of other property.
The stock price fell from a 1989 high of $35 to a low last fall of $19.375. In this year's market revival, the shares have climbed back to $25.75, despite a drop of 37.5 cents in New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday.
"Everybody was so down on real estate investment trusts," Mr. Goodrich said. "We just got swallowed up in the real estate depression." He argues that that pessimism was unwarranted.
The most important real estate assets are two big shopping centers in which Santa Anita has large interests. The first is adjacent to the track. It plans to expand by adding two more major tenants, and the second is a shopping center, Towson Town Center, near Baltimore, where expansion will be completed later this year and a Nordstrom's is scheduled to open next year.
The dual-share arrangement provides some unusual tax benefits. The profits of the operating company end up being paid as rent to the real estate trust, which passes them, along with income from other properties, through to investors in the form of dividends. The law requires the real estate trust to pay at least 95 percent of its net income to shareholders each year, but in fact it pays out much more than that as it passes along available cash flow as well.
As a result, Santa Anita shareholders got $2.08 a share in dividends last year, although the company only reported earnings of $1.41 a share, down from $1.61 the previous year. The good news for holders is that they must pay tax only on the part of the payout that represents earnings. The rest qualifies as a return of capital, and taxes on that payout are deferred until the shares are sold.
In the first three months of this year, net earnings were down slightly from the year before, with the per-share figure dipping to 61 cents from 63 cents. The company paid 52 cents in dividends.
As a result, the shares now have a dividend yield of 8.1 percent, which makes the shares sound cheap, but a price-earnings ratio of 18.5, which does not.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Ends Mixed in U.S.; Gold Up After Dip in London

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar ended mixed in quiet domestic dealings yesterday after posting narrow gains overseas.
Gold prices were also mixed. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $358.10 an ounce, up $1. The Republic National Bank later said that gold gained 60 cents an ounce, to $357.60. Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $356.95 an ounce, from $357.25 bid late on Wednesday. 
 Markets in Zurich were closed for a holiday. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold rose 65 cents to close at $358.20.
The dollar got an initial lift from a better-than-expected report from the Labor Department showing initial claims for unemployment insurance fell by 45,000, to 455,000, in the week that ended on April 27. That was down from a peak of 543,000 a month earlier and could be interpreted as an indication the economic recovery might be under way.
But the dollar reversed course on technical factors. Michael Malpede, a senior analyst at the Refco Group Ltd. in Chicago, said traders were squaring their positions before today's report on producer prices for April.
Marc Chandler, an analyst with the financial advisory firm IDEA, said that bidding for the Treasury's $11.75 billion in 30-year bonds in the Government's quarterly refunding auction was inefficient and that demand was "somewhat reluctant." Many traders had expected strong foreign appetite for the bonds, which would have helped the dollar.
Over all, "the dollar remained confined to ranges as the market awaits fresh trading incentives," he said.
Analysts noted that national holidays closed markets throughout most of continental Europe, which kept trading subdued worldwide.
In Tokyo, the dollar rose to close at 138.23 Japanese yen, from 137.88 yen on Wednesday. Later in London, it rose to 139.35 yen. In New York, the dollar settled at 138.10 yen, down from 138.30 yen on Wednesday.
In London, the pound fell to $1.7045, from $1.7180 late on Wednesday. In New York, it cost $1.7175 to buy a pound, less expensive than Wednesday's $1.7200.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with those of late on Wednesday, included: 1.7325 German marks, up from 1.7312; 1.4629 Swiss francs, down from 1.4630; 5.8585 French francs, unchanged; 1,280.25 Italian lire, down from 1,281.25, and 1.5326 Canadian dollars, up from 1.5225.
In Europe, other late dollar rates included: 1.7425 German marks, up from 1.7330; 1.4730 Swiss francs, up from 1.4655; 5.8925 French francs, up from 5.8650; 1.9635 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9523; 1,288.75 Italian lire, up from 1.282.50, and 1.1529 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1519.

HEADLINE: Council Speaker Vows to Avert Steep Cuts by Dinkins

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
A day after Mayor David N. Dinkins warned New Yorkers to show courage in the face of devastating cuts in city services, the Speaker of the City Council vowed yesterday to head off the worst of the reductions.
In doing so, the Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, appeared to undermine the Mayor's public-relations strategy -- if not his actual fiscal plans -- in which a horror list of service cuts was to be used to wrest crucial concessions from municipal unions and close a huge gap in the city's budget. 
 "The time for games is over," Mr. Vallone said. "It is time to balance the budget."
In an emotional televised address Wednesday evening, Mr. Dinkins presented a somber scenario of service reductions -- from shutting off a quarter of all street lights in the city to closing the Central Park Zoo and a suspension of the city's recycling program.
 
Cool to Concessions
 Mr. Vallone's move raised the possibility that the initiative may be slipping from the Mayor's control, even after he spent much of the last week trying to marshal support from Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, labor leaders and the public in a carefully orchestrated series of meetings and presentations culminating in his televised address. Labor leaders, although praising his speech, have remained cool to any concessions.
Yesterday, Mr. Vallone, in a brief interview a day before the Mayor is to present his budget to the Council, said he was committed to keeping the zoo open and maintaining the operation of all street lights and was seeking to maintain the Council's commitment to continue recycling.
"The zoo is back in," Mr. Vallone declared. Asked about the turning off of street lights, he added, "We are not going to close down portions of the city that we consider essential."
Mayor Dinkins did not respond directly to Mr. Vallone's remarks yesterday. But at a City Hall news conference the Mayor lost his composure, for the second time yesterday, after quoting Mr. Vallone as quoting Fiorello H. La Guardia to the effect that budgets are "conceived in despair and developed in agony." His voice halting, with tears welling in his eyes, Mr. Dinkins told how hard it was to sit across from a city commissioner "telling you about the safety net and how frayed the safety net is."
"So people who think that this is some process that one engages in as an exercise really don't understand," he said. "Not if you care. This administration cares deeply."
The Mayor also appeared to lose his composure in a similar fashion as he defended his service cuts at a meeting at City Hall with representatives of private social-service agencies.
 
Within Its Rights
 First Deputy Mayor Norman Steisel said the Council was within its rights to to restore programs as long as it came up with the money to pay for them. He said he hoped the Council would also come up with funds to restore infant-mortality programs threatened with cuts by the Mayor.
Mr. Dinkins is to present his executive budget today, giving the first detailed account of how he would find $3.4 billion to close a gap in a $29 billion budget for the fiscal year that begins on July 1. His plans include about $1 billion in new taxes, $1.5 billion in service cuts, productivity improvements and increased state aid.
As a preview to this main event, Mr. Dinkins presented a 10-year capital plan, which seeks to reduce city construction plans by $500 million next year, or about 12 percent, and a total of $2.9 billion in cuts over a five-year period as part of city economy moves.
The new plan slashed spending below previous plans, cutting spending by the Parks Department by more than 50 percent over four years. Nevertheless, the plans showed the city planned to spend $4.8 billion on construction next year, the largest construction budget in the city's history.
 
Some Flowery Praise
 Only a day before, in his televised pleas for unity and help, Mr. Dinkins reached out to Mr. Vallone, offering him a bouquet of flowery praise, albeit one wrapped in a suggestion that the Speaker might be beholden to "special interests."
"Our City Council," Mr. Dinkins said, "led by an extraordinary public servant, Speaker Peter Vallone, must act as true representatives of the people, moving beyond any special interests to enact our property tax increase."
The Mayor's tone reflects the distant relation between the Mayor and the Speaker, who have been at odds over the City Council's redistricting plans and who rarely meet to discuss the city's finances or other issues.
Months ago, Mr. Vallone rejected more than half of the nearly $800 million in property tax increases called for by the Mayor, and presented the outline of an alternative plan to cut as many as 30,000 jobs from the city payroll over the next few years.
Administration officials said Mr. Vallone would be under pressure to give up his rejection of the full $1 billion in tax increases as the budget process unfolds, especially since union leaders have conditioned their concessions on the willingness of others to share the pain.
But with the city seeking to put together a credible financial plan before the city returns to the bond market in a matter of weeks, the Mayor will be under pressure to make concessions as well, long before the June 30 deadline for adoption of the budget.
 
Expanding City Jails
 Mr. Dinkins's 10-year capital plan called for deep cuts in spending in some agencies, which were in part offset by sharp increases in others, particularly on expanding city jails and replacing a detention center for youth.
Proposals within the administration to make steep cuts in Mr. Dinkins's housing program were rejected by the Mayor, who restored $247 million in funds for housing development over the next four years. The city now plans to spend $400 million a year on housing, officials said.
The administration also cut $976 million from a $4 billion plan to rebuild many city schools, prompting Board of Education officials to question whether the cuts violated the terms of a state law that set up a School Contruction Authority several months ago.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Long Bond Yield Averages 8.21%

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
The Treasury struggled to complete the final leg of a record $37 billion set of auctions yesterday, as an $11.75 billion auction of new 30-year bonds attracted the smallest amount of bids since early 1977, when the United States began to sell such securities on a regular basis.
Because of their maturity, 30-year bonds are the most speculative security issued by the Government. As the size of outstanding issues has increased over the years, 30-year Treasury bonds have become the financial world's most favored vehicle for placing a bet on the direction of interest rates. 
 The bonds auctioned yesterday were sold at an average yield of 8.21 percent, up from the 7.98 percent average yield produced at the last 30-year bond sale on Feb. 7.
The yield was largely in line with expectations, but analysts nevertheless said the results of the auction were very poor.
The fact that only $17.3 billion worth of bids was placed for the securities was a big reason for that assessment. In relation to the $11.75 billion worth that was sold, it was the lowest amount of bids received since February 1977, the Treasury said.
In addition, the difference, or spread, between high bids and the average bid was 3 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, an unusually large amount. The large size of the "tail" indicated that dealers were far from unanimous in estimating the value of the securities.
 
Secondary Trades
 On other days, such results would have sent the secondary market for Treasury securities into a tailspin. That did not occur yesterday, however, as prices of outstanding notes and bonds actually moved slightly higher.
"The bond auction was far worse than expected, yet the results had no impact on secondary trading," said William V. Sullivan Jr., a senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds. "That suggests the distribution of the securities was far better than most expected."
By late in the day, the new bonds were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 8.20 percent.
As on Wednesday, when the Treasury auctioned new 10-year notes, rumors of a strong bid from Japanese firms for the new bonds circulated yesterday.
"The Japanese bid for a good 30 percent of the bonds," said John P. Costas, a managing director in the taxable fixed-income department at the First Boston Corporation. "It's the highest level of participation we have seen from them in the last couple of years."
An executive at one of the four large Japanese investment banks, who asked not to be identified, estimated the big-four firms actually purchased about 20 percent of the issue, or around $2.45 billion worth of bonds.
In searching for an explanation on why bond prices did not tumble after the release of the auction results, analysts and traders said market participants are expecting a good report from the Government today on inflation. Most analysts are estimating that the Producer Price Index, scheduled to be released this morning, was unchanged in April and up a modest two-tenths of a percent excluding food and energy.
Bond investors loathe any hint that inflationary pressures are intensifying because rising prices erode the inflation-adjusted value of their fixed-income investment.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the outstanding benchmark issue, the 7 7/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021, were offered at a price of 96 7/32 late yesterday, up 2/32, to yield 8.21 percent, down from 8.22 percent late on Wednesday.
Among note issues, the 7 5/8 percent five-year notes were offered at 99 7/8, up 1/32, to yield 7.65 percent. And the 7 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 11/32, unchanged on the day, to yield 6.80 percent.
Prices of securities sold earlier in the week by the Treasury also inched higher.
The 8 percent 10-year notes sold on Wednesday were offered on a when-issued basis at a price of 99 31/32, up 5/32, to yield 8 percent. And the three-year notes sold on Tuesday were offered at a price of 99 3/4, up 1/32, to yield 7.09 percent.
 
Bill Rates Slip
 Short-term Treasury bill rates dipped slightly.
By late in the day, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 5.46 percent, down 1 basis point. Six-month bill rates fell by 4 basis points, to a late offered rate of 5.58 percent.
In deference to the Treasury, corporate and tax-exempt issuers chose not to offer new debt securities yesterday.
In the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds, traders said prices of most issues were unchanged in quiet trading.
In the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds, prices of the most widely quoted issues rose 1/8 to 1/4, according to market participants.
 
New York City Issues
 An address on Wednesday evening by Mayor David N. Dinkins on the fiscal crisis confronting New York City had little impact on prices of New York City securities yesterday. Traders said prices of most New York City bonds were unchanged in light trading.
In other developments, the Federal Reserve reported yesterday that all three measures of the nation's money supply fell during the week ended April 29. The money numbers were largely in line with expectations, and had little impact on prices in the credit markets.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of 30-year Treasury bonds:

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR;
BAGHDAD REJECTS U.N. POLICE FORCE TO PROTECT KURDS

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 9

 BODY:
Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar of the United Nations told President Bush today that Baghdad had turned down an American-supported proposal for a United Nations police force in northern Iraq, raising the possibility that American troops might have to stay there far longer than the Administration had hoped.
Mr. Perez de Cuellar was said by his associates and by American officials to be unwilling to send a United Nations force in the face of Iraqi opposition, unless the Security Council authorized it, which at the moment seems unlikely.
 
No Lifting of Sanctions
 So it appears that President Saddam Hussein of Iraq -- defeated in battle, faced with awesome economic and social problems, struggling to hold his country together -- has found a way to frustrate the United States, at least for the moment. 
 But by blocking a United Nations force, Mr. Hussein in effect invites a continuing occupation of part of his country by American and other allied forces. Moreover, until the Kurdish problem is resolved satisfactorily to Americans, the United States has said it would not agree to relaxation of the economic sanctions against Iraq.
Administration officials conceded that Baghdad's action probably means a considerable delay in United States withdrawal from the area. Although the last American troops left southern Iraq on Wednesday, those in the north cannot depart until some other sizable force arrives to screen the new Kurdish refugee camps in the region.
 
'The Q Word' Is Heard
 Last week, important policy makers began to apply what they called "the Q word," meaning quagmire, to the problem developing in the area along Iraq's border with Turkey. Today, they said Mr. Perez de Cuellar's report, which was delivered to the President at a White House meeting, represented a major setback to American policy.
Mr. Bush promised last month, when he announced that the United States would aid the Kurds, that American troops would pull back quickly, handing over the camps to United Nations administration. But that plan raised the question of who would make the camps at least symbolically secure enough from possible Iraqi attack to persuade large numbers of Kurds to leave their mountain refuges. And that led to the idea of a United Nations police force.
In company with France and Britain, the United States has insisted the international organization could set up a police force in the area -- a less heavily armed force than the peacekeeping force authorized by the United Nations in southern Iraq -- without the passage of a new resolution. But Mr. Perez de Cuellar, aides said, was worried about bypassing the Security Council.
The three nations hoped, according to Western diplomats, that Iraq would not object to the police force if not specifically asked to approve of it.
 
'A Very Clear Rejection'
 But Mr. Perez de Cuellar sent an envoy to Baghdad, where he got the thumbs-down from the Iraqi Government. "Today I have received a very clear rejection from the Iraqi Government," the Secretary General said at the White House. "They do not want a United Nations police force."
John Bolton, the United States Assistant Secretary of State for International Organizations, confirmed that Mr. Perez de Cuellar was still pressing for another resolution. The problem with that is that either the Soviet Union or China or both are likely to block a Security Council authorization because they are reluctant to set precedents for interfering in the internal affairs of other countries, such as that between the Kurds and the Baghdad Government.
 
'Limited in Duration'
 Mr. Bush has been emphasizing for weeks that he would do everything possible to avoid getting bogged down in northern Iraq, with American troops stuck there because no replacements were available. At a news conference on Wednesday, he said again that he opposed any permanent commitment. And today he said that the United States still viewed its role in protecting the Kurdish refugees "as limited in duration."
"I think that is the wish of our American friends as well as the United Nations," Mr. Perez de Cuellar said, to which Mr. Bush responded, "That's for sure." But then the United Nations official took up again the line that has the White House and the State Department seething with irritation.
"I think we have to be patient," he said.
 
'Sanctions Will Remain in Place'
 According to White House aides, Mr. Bush pressed Mr. Perez de Cuellar again today to move faster, as he had done in a telephone call more than two weeks ago.
Richard Haass, Mr. Bush's special adviser on Near Eastern matters, reiterated today the Administration's determination to continue to penalize Iraq until President Hussein is replaced, even though the United Nations resolution setting the terms for ending the war, which was passed April 3, makes no demand for his departure in exchange for relaxing sanctions.
"In our view, Saddam is discredited," Mr. Haass told a group of correspondents. "As a result all possible sanctions will remain in place until he is gone. Iraqis will not participate in the region's post-crisis political, economic and security arrangements until there is a a change in regime."
Eventually, the United States wants private relief agencies and the United Nations to care for the Kurds who have been uprooted by the failed rebellion that followed the Persian Gulf war. But that cannot be done, everyone agrees, until the Kurds' fear of the central government has been overcome, and that may take considerable time.
"The goal is not simply to create a series of camps along the Iraqi border with Turkey and Iran," a senior Administration official said. "The goal is to get the Kurds to return to their place of permanent residence in safety, so the camps are envisioned as a very temporary thing."

HEADLINE: New Claims by Unemployed Fell Sharply in Late April

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 9

 BODY:
The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits declined significantly at the end of April, the Government reported today. Analysts saw the drop as a possible sign that the worst of the recession was over.
"It's confirmation of the belief that the end of the recession is not too far away," said Irwin Kellner, chief economist at Manufacturers Hanover Trust. 
 "This is further evidence that the labor markets are improving," said Michael K. Evans, a Washington economist and consultant. "It's another straw in the wind to support the view that the recession is over."
 
45,000 Fewer Claims
 The Labor Department said that for the week ended April 27, the number of people filing unemployment claims for the first time fell by 45,000 from the previous week, to 455,000.
The news followed a report last week showing the unemployment rate fell in April for the first improvement in nearly a year. The nation's unemployment rate dropped to 6.6 percent last month, down from March's rate of 6.8 percent.
Some analysts dismissed April's unemployment report as a statistical fluke, but others said it might mean that the nation's economy, mired in recession since July, was bottoming out.
The jobless claims report can be extremely volatile from week to week, but Mr. Evans noted that the four-week average of jobless claims, which many analysts consider a more reliable measure, had also fallen.
For the four weeks ended April 27, the average for weekly jobless claims filings was 476,000, Mr. Evans said, down from the 511,000 average for the similar four-week period in March.
Although the number of people filing for unemployment assistance fell in the last week of April, it was still far above the level for last year. In the similar week of 1990, there were 361,000 new jobless claims, the Labor Department said.
Samuel Kahan, an economist at Fuji Securities, cautioned against making too much of the jobless claims report. He noted that analysts were cheered by back-to-back declines in jobless claims in mid-March, only to see those claims jump by 47,000 a week later.

HEADLINE: New York's Government: Is It Too Big?

BYLINE: By SARAH BARTLETT

 BODY:
As New York City officials struggle to cope with a tide of red ink by turning off street lights and shutting down drug-treatment programs, many are asking a more fundamental question: has the local government simply grown too big for its own good?
Across the political spectrum, business executives, labor leaders and politicians are asking whether New York can afford to maintain its traditional commitment to big government when the money to pay for it is growing scarcer and scarcer. 
 New York City's financial commitment is certainly considerable. According to the latest data available from the Bureau of the Census, it spends more money per capita on its residents than any other city except the District of Columbia. That money helps pay for a $10.5 billion municipal payroll, 10,300 beds in 16 public hospitals and clinics, housing for 900,000 people, seven community colleges, and dozens of agencies that regulate everything from outdoor bootblacks to billiard parlors.
In the past, the city could count on a healthy supply of personal, corporate and real-estate taxes to pay for those services. But today, New York is confronted by what amounts to a triple whammy: the cost of social programs to combat drugs, AIDS and homelessness is soaring at the same time that Federal and state spending has been sharply curtailed and the city's traditional base of tax revenue is shrinking.
As a result, the city's longstanding commitment to provide a social safety net for its residents is under siege. Last week more than 20,000 city workers crowded the streets to protest imminent cuts in public services. And on Wednesday, Mayor David N. Dinkins delivered a somber televised address in which he detailed the painful cuts that would be necessary if substantial aid from municipal unions and the state is not forthcoming.
For the most part, Mr. Dinkins's cutbacks are meant to be temporary, with services to be restored when the economy recovers. "The situation we now face will pass," he said on Monday at City Hall. "Much of our difficulty is the economy." Out of his $3.4 billion package to deal with next year's deficit, only $58 million in savings is expected to come from downsizing the government.
But some municipal experts, and even certain members of the Dinkins administration, think that approach is too accepting of the boundaries of city government as they are currently drawn. They argue that the city needs to rethink entirely the range of services it offers, finding new ways to provide some of them at a lower cost and eliminating others altogether.
Officials in the Dinkins administration "are asking questions like how they can avoid the Financial Control Board, how can they get through 1992," said Stephen Berger, chairman of the Financial Guaranty Insurance Company and former executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. "The real question is: How can they unwind these bureaucratic public institutions and find different ways of assuring service?"
City officials often try to justify the relatively high level of public spending by noting that many of the services New York City offers are normally paid for by county governments, making strict comparisons difficult. That is also true of Washington, which provides services traditionally provided by counties and states.
But as far as New York is concerned, that justification can be somewhat misleading. Consider Los Angeles, the nation's second most populous city. Even if its budget is combined with that for Los Angeles County, which pays for much of the area's social-welfare programs, the two governments still spend a little more than half as much per capita on their residents as New York City.
The City of Los Angeles, for example, offers its residents no public higher education; that is provided by the state. And it has no public hospitals. Los Angeles County has six public hospitals, but they have just 3,020 beds, a third the number available in New York City, which has 1.1 million fewer people than Los Angeles County.
Chicago pays only one-third of the cost of its community colleges and has no city university system. Its only public hospital is run by Cook County, and has one-tenth as many beds as New York despite having three-quarters as many people as New York City.
 
History of Advocacy For Public Relief
 Per capita spending is higher in New York City -- and ambitions greater -- for a variety of reasons. Some of them hark back to an era when the city was a thriving commercial and manufacturing center determined to respond to the influx of immigrants who needed temporary public assistance.
It was the city rather than the state that adopted its own unemployment-relief program during the Depression, and started the first full-scale public-housing program that became a model for Federal programs in the New Deal. That same history explains why New York City pays a larger share of state Medicaid costs than any other city.
"In terms of ideology and thinking about the role of government, New York City was very open to what was going on in Europe -- much more than any place else in this country," observed Dick Netzer, professor of economics at New York University. "Local government here became much more activist, like governments in industrial Europe."
Perhaps as a result of this cultural tradition, New York has also shown itself to be more susceptible to political pressures. When the public outcry over homelessness grew to a crescendo, Mayor Edward I. Koch reversed himself and committed the city to the largest low-income housing program in the country. When Mr. Dinkins tried to close firehouses in low-density areas, the public outcry was so great that he immediately relented.
Over time it became commonly accepted that New York's local government could and should try to protect its residents from all potential sources of harm. The result is that although other cities have also been hurt by cutbacks in Federal and state aid, they have not all rushed to fill the vacuum the way New York City has. Los Angeles, for instance, has a limited commitment to shelter poor people.
"The city is stuck trying to fill the Federal Government's housing role, the state's Medicaid role, and also provide local basic services," said Allen J. Proctor, executive director of the Financial Control Board, which oversees the city's spending.
The question Mr. Proctor and others are now asking is whether and how the local government can continue to deliver services that are considered essential without bankrupting the city or forcing taxes so much higher that more businesses and wage-earners flee, further eroding the tax base.
 
Trap With No Exits: Streamlined Services
The city's Comptroller, Elizabeth Holtzman, said some might liken this problem to a trap with no exits. "This crisis creates opportunities to change the way the city works in a fundamental way," she said. She and others have proposed a frontal assault on waste and bureaucracy, returning some services to the private sector, and getting out of some businesses altogether.
Some politicians would move to eliminate certain government units that have parallels at the state level, like the Human Rights Commission and the Department of Consumer Affairs, transferring the latter's revenue-generating licensing authority to other agencies and eliminating one agency's administrative costs. Others would like to see the city's two computer-service agencies combined, and the Cultural Affairs Department eliminated.
Some former city officials also argue that many mayoral offices -- like the commission on the status of women, and the offices for children and families, health policy, housing coordination, midtown enforcement and people with disabilities -- would be expendable if other city agencies would simply fulfill their mandates. Some who study New York's urban problems have recommended eliminating the borough presidents' offices for a savings of $30.8 million.
While cuts like these might lighten the city administration, the organizations involved are for the most part so small that their elimination would not do much to solve the budget shortfall. That has led some municipal experts to conclude that the Dinkins administration has no choice but to tackle three big areas of city spending: health care, education and housing, even though doing so is most likely to engender fierce political opposition.
The city's costs for Medicaid, the main health program for the poor, have almost tripled in 10 years, to $1.8 billion in the last fiscal year from $650 million in 1980. City officials are quick to point out that New York City pays a higher proportion of state Medicaid than any other urban area. But New York also has a far more liberal eligibility standard and more generous range of benefits, which some politicians now say should be trimmed back.
The Mayor's management advisory task force has emphasized the savings the city would reap if it could assign a Medicaid patient to a particular center. Proponents said such a system would not only reduce duplicative record-keeping, but would also improve preventive health care and reduce the stream of Medicaid patients into expensive emergency rooms.
Some municipal observers like Felix G. Rohatyn, chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, which was created in the 1970's to help finance the city's deficit, have suggested that the city also consider returning hospitals to the private sector, on the theory that it would run them more efficiently. But social-service advocacy groups remain skeptical.
"I'm not against privatization," said David R. Jones, president of the Community Services Society. "But I question whether you'll get the cost savings." He also said that any shift to the private sector would have to be accompanied by more stringent enforcement of the law requiring private hospitals to accept Medicaid patients.
Some former officials and public-policy experts think the city's public education system also needs to be examined. New York now has 86,200 employees devoted to education, a 23 percent increase from 10 years ago. Spending by the Board of Education, meanwhile, has more than doubled.
Despite the commitment of resources, condemnation of the city's public-school system is almost universal, leading a variety of critics to suggest that the problem is not a lack of money but the way the city spends it. They have called for more cuts in the Board of Education's administrative staff and more freedom for individual schools.
 
Relieving the State To Unburden City
Some people, including Mr. Rohatyn, have questioned the need for both a state and a citywide university system. A recent study by the State Comptroller, for instance, found that the state spends about $32 million supporting colleges for the study of forestry and maritime activities, and questioned whether the state could afford to support such efforts in the current climate.
Since the state pays most of the costs of the State University of New York and the City University, merging them would not result in direct savings to the city. But Mr. Rohatyn and others consider the state's and the city's budget troubles intertwined, and say that anything that would reduce the pressure on one would ultimately help the other.
Public housing is the third big area that many who have studied the city's finances believe should be re-examined. Many municipal experts are proud of the city's efforts to fight homelessness, but still question whether the city should try to fill the vacuum caused by the Federal Government's retreat from low-income housing programs.
They feel that the city can no longer afford to be the landlord of last resort, rehabilitating more than 10,000 apartments a year through the Department of Housing Preservation and Development and taking on ancillary services like construction and oversight of fuel deliveries.
Many of these proposals could be expected to generate fierce opposition from a wide variety of constituencies: advocacy groups for the poor, labor unions and voters dismayed by the scaling back of New York City's welfare role.
Mr. Berger, the former Port Authority chief, believes that in a time of economic crisis, ideas previously considered too radical will gain new currency. But others point to the 1970's: As the city's fiscal problems gradually subsided, so too did pressure for fundamental change.

HEADLINE: Worry on Quayle Continues With News of Bush's Health, Poll Says

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER

 BODY:
Thrust into the spotlight because of President Bush's health problems, Vice President Dan Quayle continues to stir deep anxiety among Americans, with 62 percent saying they worry about the prospect of a Quayle Presidency, the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll has found.
Nearly three years of careful image-grooming have done little to improve the public's perception of the 44-year-old Mr. Quayle, the poll suggests: Only 19 percent of those who participated in the survey say they have a favorable opinion of the Vice President. Twenty-two percent held that view just after the election in November 1988, three months after Mr. Bush stunned much of the political world by selecting the young Senator from Indiana as his running mate. 
 And 54 percent said Mr. Bush should replace Mr. Quayle in 1992. That possibility is often discussed by commentators and political professionals, but it has been repeatedly ruled out by the President. Just 32 percent in the survey say Mr. Quayle should be kept on the ticket.
 
Doubts Among Republicans
 The survey showed pervasive doubts about Mr. Quayle in his own party: 42 percent of those identifying themselves as Republicans favored keeping Mr. Quayle on the ticket, but 47 percent said he should be replaced. Even those who identify themselves as conservative Republicans, thought to be Mr. Quayle's strongest supporters, are evenly divided on whether he should stay or go.
Less than a third of all those responding to the poll say Mr. Quayle passes a basic test for a Vice President. To the question "If something happens to George Bush, do you think Dan Quayle would be qualified to serve as President, or would you be worried about him?" 30 percent said he would be qualified and 62 percent said they would be worried. This has changed little in the last three years.
The poll, with a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points, was conducted through telephone interviews with 909 adults around the country on Tuesday and Wednesday. That was after Mr. Bush had returned to work and after the announcement that his heart irregularity had been attributed to a treatable thyroid problem, but it was before the White House said he had Graves' disease.
 
Quayle Gains Some Support
 The survey showed that most Americans were rallying around the President. Eighty-one percent said they approved of the way he was doing his job. That was an improvement over his rating in two Gallup Polls in recent weeks that showed him receiving about 75 percent approval. The jump in support was reminiscent of that accorded ailing Presidents in the past, from Dwight D. Eisenhower, who rose in the Gallup Poll after a heart attack in 1955, to Ronald Reagan, whose popularity climbed in polls after he underwent colon surgery in 1985.
Even after Mr. Bush was back on the job, there were signs of lingering anxiety among the public about his health. Twenty-seven percent said they were very or somewhat "concerned" that Mr. Bush might not be able to complete his term as President.
The Times/CBS News Poll did find a few signs of improvement in Mr. Quayle's ratings -- a few indications that some Americans, at least, see him growing in office. Forty-eight percent said they thought he understood the complicated problems a President must deal with, as against 33 percent who said so in mid-October 1988. And a Gallup Poll conducted on Monday and Tuesday suggested some gains for Mr. Quayle since last November, the last time Gallup asked a comparable question about his qualifications to be President.
But The Times/CBS News Poll registered overwhelming and persistent doubts about Mr. Quayle at a time when Ameicans were forced to confront the possibility of his assuming Presidential power. Mr. Quayle would have become acting President, temporarily, if Mr. Bush had undergone the electric shock treatment to his heart that was considered earlier this week, before the President's condition responded to medication.
 
Little Fallout Over Kurds
 The proportion of those who said they held an unfavorable opinion of Mr. Quayle actually rose slightly, to 32 percent, as against 27 percent in March. The proportion of those who said they held a favorable opinion remained at 19 percent. Forty-seven percent said they were undecided or had not heard enough to have formed an opinion.
Asked to explain their disapproval, people most often cited what they viewed as his youth and immaturity, a perceived lack of qualifications and their sense that he simply did not seem like a leader.
One-sixth of those surveyed said they would be more likely to vote for the Republican ticket in 1992 if Mr. Quayle was replaced. For all of that, Mr. Bush is not considered likely to replace Mr. Quayle, and some analysts have suggested that the Republicans will suffer little for it.
In 1988, the voters' doubts over Mr. Quayle did not prevent a Republican landslide, even though Democrats tried hard to build on those fears in a number of television commercials.
The poll's results suggest that the Bush Administration is suffering little political fallout over the Kurds: Just 32 percent say the United States should do more to help the Kurdish refugees in Iraq, while 47 percent say it is doing enough and 12 percent say it is doing too much.
Sixty-one percent approve of Mr. Bush's handling of the Kurdish situation. And 53 percent say American actions are not to blame for the plight of the Kurds, while 32 percent say the United States is partly responsible.
Some Democrats had predicted that the Kurds' situation, along with the recession and other domestic problems, would dim Mr. Bush's post-war glow. But the poll found his overall approval rating to be 81 percent.
However, the poll continued to show a huge gap in approval of Mr. Bush's handling of foreign and domestic policy. Seventy-four percent said they approve of his foreign policy, and 41 percent said they approved of his handling of the economy.
On another issue recently in the news, only 11 percent said they believed reports to be true that people in the 1980 Reagan campaign encouraged the Iranian Government to hold the American hostages in Iran until after the election as a means of weakening President Carter. Forty-four percent said they would not rule out those reports, saying they "might possibly be true." And 32 percent said the reports were "almost certainly not true."

HEADLINE: Treasury's Sale Result Lifts Stocks

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
The stock market came out of a slump late yesterday and moved sharply higher. Traders attributed the upturn to Wall Street relief that in spite of all the concern over the huge three-day Treasury refinancing, the sales came off well.
The Dow Jones industrial average of 30 blue chips, which climbed 30 points early in the day and then gave back half of that gain fairly rapidly, ended the day ahead 40.25 points, or 1.4 percent, to 2,971.15. The Dow is now only slightly more than 33 points from its record close of 3,004.46 established in mid-April. 
 "As soon as the Street realized that the Treasury raised $37 billion without increasing long-term bond yields very much, it released pent-up cash to go into stocks," said Peter G. Grennan, senior vice president of Shearson Lehman Brothers.
 
Overcomes Weakness
 "We got the news about the third leg of the refunding, shortly after 2 P.M.," he noted, "and at that point stocks turned up again." The Dow had been weak for at least an hour before the news.
The bidding in the final leg of the auctions was sluggish, but the Treasury sold $11.75 billion of new 30-year bonds at an average yield of 8.21 percent, which was in the expected range. [Page D14.]
All the major stock market averages quickly moved ahead sharply. The broader-based Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks, gaining almost as much as the Dow, rose 1.3 percent, or 4.74 points, to 383.25. The smaller stocks, as represented by the Nasdaq composite, tacked on 1.1 percent, or 5.30 points, to 497.81. The American Stock Exchange's market value index, another measure of the smaller stocks, also moved ahead but by about half as much.
 
Fairly Strong Volume
Trading volume, while not exactly sizzling, rose to a fairly strong 180.2 million shares, from a slugglish 157.2 million on Wednesday.
The New York Stock Exchange said advances led declines by 1,101 to 516, or a little more than 2 to 1. Three Big Board stocks slid to 52-week lows while an impressive 98 rose to 52-week highs.
Computer-driven program buying, particularly after the favorable results of the Treasury refinancing, lifted the Dow by almost 19 points, Birinyi Associates said.
The Dow slid 24.15 points on Tuesday amid widespread fears that the sheer size of the refunding, coming on top of disquieting economic news, would make investors hesitant. But Wednesday, the Dow climbed 13.41 as many traders realized that the refinancing was going well. And yesterday, in what Mr. Grennan called "a sigh of relief" that the auction was over, the market responsed instantly.
Among the Dow stocks, gains of a point or more were widespread. Walt Disney, a Dow newcomer since Monday, rose 3 1/2, to 123 1/4. I.B.M. rose 2 1/8, to 105 7/8, on 1.5 million shares, and Minnesota Mining and Mannufacturing rose 2 1/8, to 89 7/8.
 
Several Dow Stocks Up 1 or More
 Among the Dow gainers of a point or more were Merck, General Motors, International Paper, Coca-Cola, Exxon, Boeing, Du Pont and Texaco.
Among other movers, Wal-Mart Stores rose 2, to 42, with two million shares changing hands, making the retailer the sixth-most-active Big Board stock. Wal-Mart said sales rose 37 percent in the three months ended April 30.
Other retailing stocks were also strong. Dillard Department Stores climbed 1 3/8, to 121; J. C. Penney 1 1/4, to 54 7/8; Dayton Hudson 1 1/2, to 75 1/2, and Home Depot 1 1/2, to 60. Toys "R" Us tacked on 1 5/8, to 29 1/2; Gap 1 1/2, to 58 1/2; Melville 1, to 49 7/8, and Nordstrom 1 1/4, to 42.
 
'Excellent Opportunities'
 Commenting on the industry in his latest report, Bruce Missett, retailing analyst for Morgan Stanley & Company, said, "Investors' perception of gradual improvement in consumer spending and growing confidence in expense control have helped drive up the share prices of both growth and more mature retailers."
He continued, "While the price movement has been substantial, valuations are still below their historical averages, and excellent investment opportunities remain, in our view." His buy list included Dillard, Dayton Hudson, Limited, Circuit City, Gap, Toys "R" Us and Woolworth.
Technology and health-care stocks were also strong.
Bristol-Myers Squibb rose 2 5/8, to 80 3/4, with 1.2 million shares changing hands. Richard Gelb, the company's chairman, told stockholders at the annual meeting on Tuesday that the Food and Drug Administration would review its AIDS drug, Videx, in July.
 
Pfizer Up 2 1/8
 Pfizer rose 2 1/8, to 58 1/8, in brisk trading, although there did not appear to be any news to account for it.
Amgen, recommended by Michael Sorell, biotechnology analyst at Morgan Stanley, rose 2 1/2, to 129 1/4. Chiron, another Sorell "buy," rose 1, to 56 1/2.
Drug stocks rising a point or more included Schering-Plough, Merck, Johnson & Johnson, Warner-Lambert and Eli Lilly.
In the technology group, Intel gained 3, to 54 1/2; Microsoft 2 3/4, to 105 3/4; Hewlett-Packard 2 1/2, to 49, and Borland International 2 1/2, to 54. Adobe Systems rose 2 3/4, to 54 1/2.
Morgan Stanley told investors in its latest report that "with the equity market uncertain about the direction of interest rates, spooked by first-quarter earnings shortfalls and in a mood to harvest investment gains, our 'fresh money buys list' is concentrated in technology, basic industry and energy stocks, whose long-term prospects remain unusually compelling."
 
Tokyo Stocks Are Lower
TOKYO, Friday, May 10 (Reuters) -- Stock prices declined today in Tokyo. The Nikkei index of 225 stocks ended the week at 26,274.29, off 164.21 points, or about six-tenths of a percent. For a week, it fell 203.57 or about eight-tenths of a percent.

HEADLINE: Bell Units' Rivals Gain At F.C.C.

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 9

 BODY:
In a move that could greatly increase competition for many local telephone companies, the Federal Communications Commission proposed a rule today that would force them to let rivals plug directly into local telephone systems.
The proposal, which officials hope will be adopted within 12 months, will be a big help for the growing number of operators of high-speed fiber optic lines that bypass the traditional telephone system. These companies allow customers to reach their long-distance carriers at prices considerably lower than the access charges imposed by local telephone companies. Access charges account for about 40 percent of the cost of long-distance service. 
 Over the long term, the measure represents an important step in chipping away at the near-total domination of traditional telephone companies in their local markets. Large corporations have begun to consider the newer services in developing local private networks to link their offices.
 
Issues Are Unresolved
 F.C.C. officials said they considered the measure a priority although many issues remained unresolved, particularly those concerning rates that telephone companies would charge for making connections.
The heart of today's proposal is a requirement that telephone companies with revenues greater than $100 million a year let the aspiring rivals set up switching equipment on or very near their premises. This will cover most local phone companies that serve mid-sized and large cities. At the moment, bypass companies account for less than 1 percent of the local telephone market.
The measure will mean that a fiber optic company can run lines directly to the neighborhood switching stations and then use the telephone company lines to reach individual customers.
 
Deeper Market Penetration
 Under the proposal, the telephone companies will have to offer special rates that reflect the narrowed use. As a practical matter, the change will make it economically feasible for the bypass companies to penetrate much more deeply into local markets than they can now.
At the moment, these rivals serve only customers who are connected directly to their fiber optic lines. These lines are analagous to superhighways: They are excellent for relaying heavy volumes of traffic along a busy corridor, but they do not offer the equivalent of backroads that reach throughout a community.
Today's proposal will address this "last mile" problem by allowing new providers to run high-speed lines to the telephone company's neighborhood substations scattered around a city. Customers will use the telephone company only for a tiny segment of their service, and use the bypass company for the rest of the service.
The proposal was greeted enthusiastically by Metropolitan Fiber Systems of Oak Brook, Ill., which operates fiber networks in 11 cities, including New York, and had proposed the new rule. "Over all, we truly do applaud the F.C.C. on the action they have taken," said Royce Holland, chief executive of Metropolitan Fiber. "This is a giant step in opening up this last bastion of monopoly control to competition."
It was also applauded by long-distance carriers, including both A.T. &T. and the MCI Communications Corporation, which stand to benefit from lower access charges. "This will speed the day when there are more choices for consumers at the local level," said John Houser, an MCI spokesman. "This will speed the day when access charges will be lower,"
The regional Bell companies had mixed reactions. Some have long predicted that competition is inevitable, but some expressed concern about being forced to encourage competition when their prices reflect obligations imposed by state utility commissions.
"What we're worried about is that we're still restricted as to what markets we are allowed to expand into, while others are now expanding into our markets," said William F. Adler, executive director of Federal regulatory relations in the Washington office of the Pacific Telesis Corporation.
 
Local Companies Restricted
 Unlike their new competitors, who can choose to provide service only through the most lucrative high-traffic areas, the local telephone companies are obligated by state and Federal governments to make service available to everyone in their jurisdictions and to keep prices for residential customer comparatively low.
The upshot is that prices to residential customers are frequently artificially low, while prices for large corporate customers artificially high.
Metropolitan Fiber Systems is considered the largest player, with plans to add nine operations by the end of 1992. Other significant providers are New York Teleport of New York City and the Institutional Communications Company in McLean, Va.
Thus far, competing providers have tended to push down prices on business lines in the markets they have entered. Mr. Holland, of Metropolitan Fiber, said his company usually charged about 10 percent to 20 percent less than the local telephone company, but those prices were eventually matched.
Mr. Holland said about 18 cities now had a competing provider of local telephone service and that the market would be saturated if his company simply expanded according to its current plan. If the rule is adopted, however, bypass companies would probably be able to generate profits in as many as 50 more cities.
The F.C.C. took another action intended to lower customers' bills, this one for calls made from the United States to foreign countries. The F.C.C. has long contended that state-owned telephone companies in Europe and Latin America charge excessive prices for receiving calls and that these charges currently drain about $3 billion a year from the United States.
In the action today, the F.C.C. ordered American long-distance companies to negotiate rates with foreign telephone companies that reflect the declining cost of new technology. If the negotiations do not result in lower rates, F.C.C. officials said they would consider prohibiting Americans from paying rates higher than those it considered fair.
 In moves concering radio broadcasters, the F.C.C. proposed relaxing rules that currently limit a company from owning more than 12 AM and 12 FM stations, as well as rules that bar a company from owning both an AM and FM station in one market.

TRADITIONAL PHONE SERVICE
 
Calls must travel over local telephones lines. The local phone company charges for access to its lines and businesses that want to establish private networks must lease lines from the local company.
 
EXISTING FIBER-OPTIC PHONE SERVICES
 
To establish private networks for customers, an independent phone company must lay a fiber-optic network parallel to existing phone lines, lines to branch offices.
 
PROPOSED FIBER-OPTIC PHONE SERVICES
 
The Federal Communications Commission has proposed that private fiber-optic phone companies be allowed to plug into a local phone company's switching stations. The access costs would be smaller because calls would use local lines for a shorter time. (pg.D6)

BYLINE: By Rita Reif

 BODY:
A Frida Kahlo
The second Frida Kahlo self-portrait from the 1940's to be auctioned in New York in a year is the most important work in Christie's Latin American art sale at 7 P.M. on Wednesday. The painting, from 1947, is an intense study of this solemn-faced Mexican artist with her long thick black hair hanging loosely. It was painted after a year of undergoing operations to correct injuries from a bus accident when she was 18 years old.
At 24 by 17 inches, it is twice the size of her self-portrait "Diego and I," from 1949, which brought $1.4 million last May at Sotheby's. This small work, which was the first Latin American artwork to exceed $1 million at auction, shows Kahlo with her hair down and with an image of the artist Diego Rivera, her husband, painted at the center of her forehead. 
 "The loosened hair is one indication of her sadness," said Lisa Palmer, who heads Christie's Latin American art sales. "If she was in despair, she depicted herself this way. When she was happy, she painted herself in braids, her hair piled high on her head.
"Self-portraits were a recurrent theme throughout Kahlo's career. They represent about one-third of her works. She would paint a portrait and would send it to a friend with a bill. Those who were not thrilled with this uninvited gift would return the painting."
Mrs. Palmer said the artist, who was 40 years old when she completed the 1947 painting, wrote in the inscription across the bottom of the painting that she was 37 years old.
Since 1985, Kahlo's works have been part of the national patrimony of Mexico. "This means they cannot be exported and are increasingly difficult to find in the market," Mrs. Palmer said. Since Kahlo's total output was small, her self-portraits are scarce today, even though the record-breaking painting sold at Sotheby's last May is still available at the gallery of the buyer, Mary-Anne Martin of Manhattan.
The value of Kahlo paintings dramatically escalated in the 1980's art boom, Ms. Martin said. In fact, the portrait at Christie's was bought in 1982 for $85,000 at Ms. Martin's gallery by Louise Noun, a collector from Iowa. Ms. Noun is selling the painting to establish a women's archive at the University of Iowa.
Christie's presale estimate is $1 million to $2 million.
Compared with other art sales in November, in which about half the works went unsold, the Latin American art auctions last fall in Manhattan realized healthy totals. Christie's achieved a record total for a Latin American art sale -- $12.4 million -- at an auction in which 228 works of the 317 offered were sold. It was below the low estimate of $13 million.
The Latin American art sales this month are being viewed by auctioneers, dealers and collectors as the first test of this market in the recession. Sotheby's canceled its sales of Latin American art this month and included 32 works by these artists in its contemporary art auctions last week and in this week's sales of Impressionist and modern art. Of the 32 Latin American works in the auctions, which were estimated by the house to bring about $3 million to $4 million, 22 were sold for a total of $1.7 million.
Christie's has no intention of canceling its Latin American art sales, Mrs. Palmer said. The two-day sale, which is to continue at 10 A.M. on Thursday, will offer 213 works estimated by the house to total $13 million to $16 million.
"What's been making prices go up and paintings sell in the specialty sales is the competition between the Latin American buyers, the Americans and the Europeans," said Ms. Martin, who is a former head of Latin American art sales at Sotheby's.
Meanwhile, Sotheby's is reviewing its decision to cancel its Latin American sales. Diana D. Brooks, Sotheby's president in North America, wrote to clients last month asking them to express their opinions about how they wished such art to be presented.
David J. Nash, who heads Sotheby's fine-art sales internationally, had urged that Latin American art be combined with European and postwar American art in sales. But this week, after Tuesday night's unsuccessful Impressionist and modern art auction, in which only two of the five works by Latin American artists were sold, Mr. Nash said, "We are keeping an open mind whether this is the right approach."
 
African Sculpture
 An angular African sculpture of a woman, carved a century ago by a Senufo artisan in the southern part of what is known today as Mali, is the most important work in the tribal-art sale to be held at 10:15 A.M. on Wednesday at Sotheby's in New York. The smoothly sculptured ritual artifact, a three-foot rhythm pounder with a bronzelike patina, was used in ritual dances.
It was shown in 1984 at the Museum of Modern Art exhibition " 'Primitivism' in 20th-Century Art" and was later owned by the show's organizer, William S. Rubin, the former director of the department of painting and sculpture at the Modern.
Bernard de Grunne, who heads Sotheby's tribal-art sales, said this week that Mr. Rubin owned the figure until three or four months ago, when it was acquired by the seller, a European collector who wishes to remain anonymous.
Why is the owner selling the figure?
Mr. de Grunne said: "I don't know. Maybe he doesn't like it, or maybe he needs the money."
Susan Vogel, director of the Center for African Art in Manhattan, described the figure as an "absolutely wonderful piece, one of a tiny group of similar ones all by the same workshop or the same hand."
Mr. de Grunne, who has headed tribal-art sales at Sotheby's since 1987, described the carving as "the best African piece I have ever offered for sale."
Sotheby's presale estimate is $800,000 to $1 million.
 
One Big Sapphire
 Large stones discovered at the turn of the century are among the most discussed items in next week's jewelry sales organized in Geneva by Christie's and Sotheby's. Christie's is to auction a 337.66-carat sapphire, described by the house as the largest ever to be auctioned, in a sale to be held on Thursday night. Squarish with rounded corners, the stone was framed in diamonds weighing 24 carats and mounted as a pendant in 1910 by Cartier of Paris.
Francois Curiel, who heads Christie's European art sales, said on Wednesday that the house's original presale estimate of $1.6 million for the sapphire was recently reduced because of the recession. The estimate is now $850,000 to $1 million.
A pear-shaped 69.68-carat diamond, the weightiest jewel of the 21 cut at the turn of the century from what was then the largest gem-quality diamond in the world, is to be auctioned on Wednesday by Sotheby's in Geneva. It was cut from the loaf-shaped blue-white 995-carat Excelsior, which was discovered in 1893 in Jagersfontein, South Africa, and which was exceeded in size in 1905, when the 3,106-carat Cullinan was discovered. Both were cut by the I. J. Asscher diamond company of Amsterdam.
Sotheby's diamond, called the Excelsior I, is owned by a European client who bought the stone in the last year. Sotheby's presale estimate is $2 million to $3 million.
CHRISTIE'S, Park Avenue at 59th Street in Manhattan, (212) 546-1010. Viewing hours for Latin American art: 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. tomorrow; 1 to 5 P.M. on Sunday; 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. on Monday and Tuesday; 10 A.M. to noon on Wednesday.

What an Old Scroll Tells About Buddhism in Korea

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BRENSON

 BODY:
"The Story of a Painting: A Korean Buddhist Treasure From the Mary and Jackson Burke Foundation" is the first exhibition at the Asia Society that was conceived under its new director, Dr. Vishakha N. Desai, and it points one of New York's revered institutions of Asian art in a new direction.
This idea-filled yet overanxious and overambitious exhibition, organized by Dr. Hongnam Kim, an Asia Society curator who also wrote the catalogue essay, inaugurates "Objects in Context," a key part of Dr. Desai's curatorial program. 
 "In this series of annual exhibitions," the new director writes in her preface, "we intend to feature a single work of Asian art, generally from the permanent collection, augmented with related loans from public and private collections in the United States, to highlight the multiple layers of meaning -- esthetic, cultural, art historical, functional -- embedded in the work."
The painting whose story is being told is "Sakyamuni Buddha and Attendant Bodhisattvas," a 426-year-old hanging scroll discovered in Japan in 1989 and acquired by the Mary and Jackson Burke Foundation in New York in 1990. It is not large, around 28 inches tall and 13 inches wide, and is easily obscured by the more than 60 paintings and sculptures around it.
This restrained yet expressive work, which has darkened considerably with time, is one of 400 paintings completed in 1565 for the Hoeam-sa temple near Seoul. The temple was reconstructed by the Queen Dowager Munjong, who seems to have been almost single-handedly responsible for reviving Buddhism in her country. The pictorial program at Hoeam-sa was clearly a pillar of her Buddhist revival. When all 400 pieces of this vast religious and cosmological puzzle were in place, the effect must have been both meditative and spectacular.
The painting presents Sakyamuni Buddha, the historical Buddha, on a throne (Sakyamuni was, Dr. Kim writes, the founder of the faith, the "paradigm for the Buddhas who transcend time and space, existing outside of all doctrines and scriptures"). The delicate, frontal, almost feathery figure is flanked by two bodhisattvas (enlightened beings) who carry out the Buddha's word. The triadic composition (each figure is a point of a triangle) was widespread throughout Asia (as it was throughout Renaissance Italy). The most accessible part of the exhibition is devoted to this composition and its many forms in Asian art.
The installation places the work in the context of the Songgwang-sa monastery in Korea (Hoeam-sa temple was destroyed sometime between 1565 and 1825). It places the work in the context of Buddhist "banner" paintings, or t'aenghwa, of which there are two kinds: one small, private and made for indoors (like the Burke painting), one large (some were colossal), public and made for outdoor display.
The exhibition is instructive in many ways. Its variety of work from all over Asia underlines a diversity of Asian art that the public may not expect. It suggests a Korean style of painting that is much flatter (at times almost wafer thin) and, despite its apparent gentleness and self-effacement, is spellbinding and authoritative in intention and emphatically rhythmic in chromatic effect.
The exhibition also reveals that the figures in the Burke painting were part of a type -- oval face, arched eyebrows, almond-shaped eyes -- that essentially developed in Tang Dynasty China (618-907) and became an Asian style. The section on connoisseurship points out that the distinctions between Korean, Japanese and Chinese art are not always as clear as they may seem.
The exhibition provides a good deal of information about Dr. Desai, whose appointment last year as Asia Society director is as important in its own way as the recent selections of David Ross as director of the Whitney Museum of American Art and Robert Storr as a curator at the Museum of Modern Art.
Dr. Desai, a scholar of Indian art who had been a teacher and curator in Boston, Mr. Ross and Mr. Storr are all in their early 40's. She shares with them a far-ranging intellectual curiosity and eagerness to engage the kinds of issues -- including the meaning and formation of an artistic "mainstream" and canon -- that are helping to define the first years of this decade.
What does this exhibition tell us about her curatorial vision? For one thing, it is contextual in a broad sense. It approaches the painting from religious and artistic as well as political and historical perspectives.
For another, the focus of the show is not China, Japan and India, the giants of Asian art, but Korea, whose art is far less known in the United States.
Dr. Desai is clearly interested in opening up the field of Asian art so that the public will consider all its aspects and also question prevailing assumptions about which styles, traditions and approaches are worthy of serious consideration.
In addition, the show is a clear attempt to develop the resources of the Asia Society and to court collectors. Nine works in the show are from the museum's permanent collection. The centerpiece, as well as some of the Japanese paintings in the show, were lent by Mary Burke, a major collector of Japanese art and a member of the Friends of the Asia Society Galleries, a group that provides the museum with advice, economic support and artistic loans.
The exhibition also suggests some of the dangers of a contextual orientation. Although the painting is clearly a historical document of considerable importance, it is not a masterpiece. It is, in fact, considerably less compelling than some of the other paintings around it.
The problem is almost fatal. A show about a single work in context has to choose a work that is, if not demonstrably great, at least an artistic statement with unmistakable visual weight and power. The esthetic stature of this painting is questionable amid all the strong works around it. As a result, the exhibition has no center, and it seems more an attempt to present a new work and communicate a new curatorial approach than a desire to put the public in touch with a work it needs to understand.
In addition, the exhibition attempts too much. There are so many directions to follow that the points the show sets out to make are obscured or lost.
But stay tuned for the next installment in the "Objects in Context" series. The dynamism and scholarship in this show are clear evidence of a curatorial administration with a lot to say. In Chapter 2, many of the problems here may be resolved.
 "The Story of a Painting: A Korean Buddhist Treasure From the Mary and Jackson Burke Foundation" remains at the Asia Society, 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, through July 28.
 
Arturo Martini
Philippe Daverio Gallery
41 East 57th Street
Through June 15
This exhibition offers a glimpse at a 20th-century Italian sculptor who is almost entirely unknown in the United States, even through he may be the equal of Marino Marini and Giacomo Manzu. It presents 10 small sculptures and 3 large reclining nudes, all in bronze. It does not include any of Martini's sculptures in plaster, terra cotta or stone (although one reclining figure was cast from stone). If the show cannot suggest the range of Martini's work, it does reveal his talent and the difficulty in pinning his work down.
Martini was born in Treviso in 1889 and died in Milan in 1947. The artists with whom he studied or was affiliated, including the German sculptor Adolf von Hildebrand and the Italian painter Carlo Carra, as well as the group Valori Plastici (Plastic Values), were committed to finding a modern way of working with the human figure. The sculptures in this show fit easily into classical and academic categories, but they are not all that idealized and there is something that saves almost all of them from being academic.
Martini had a real touch. He also had a sense of line and surface and the kind of feeling for void that cannot be taught: the spaces between arms and body, and between legs, can be more convincing than the limbs themselves. He also had a feeling for the odd angle that keeps you turning around a work, and for quirky bumps that disrupt a flowing movement or shift the weight in a surprising direction. In "Woman in the Sun" and "La Pisana," both reclining nudes, the movement through and around the body is extremely active, even though the figures are at rest. It would be nice to be given a larger selection of work so that it would be possible to see how far Martini's talent managed to go.

HEADLINE: BOXING;
Nunn Fight Looks Like an Economic Prize for His Resurgent Hometown

BYLINE: By PHIL BERGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DAVENPORT, Iowa, May 9

 BODY:
In an era when prime-time fights routinely land in Las Vegas and Reno and Atlantic City, where casinos use them to draw high rollers to their gaming tables, a hometown hero has returned here to the banks of the Mississippi to defend his world title.
Here, there are no flashing neon hotel signs or honking horns downtown. Davenport, Iowa, population 100,000, is surely an odd spoke on boxing's big wheel. 
 But on Friday night, in John O'Donnell Stadium, a baseball park that is home to a Class A affiliate of the California Angels, Davenport native Michael Nunn, the International Boxing Federation middleweight champion, will be in action against an undefeated contender named James Toney.
 
Trend in Site-Setting?
 Is the grass-roots setting of the fight a trend? After all, just last weekend Orlando Canizales defended his bantamweight title in Laredo, Tex.
It's doubtful. The Nunn bout is a specific case in which both the fighter and his hometown benefit. For Nunn, it's a rare chance to show off his slick moves to the people he grew up with, and still be awarded in a manner to which he is accustomed. Nunn, who, like Jerry Lewis, is more popular in France than he is on these shores, gets to keep the fight's gate receipts, which could go as high as $750,000. That is as good -- and predictably better -- than any casino would have paid him for this match.
For Davenport, the fight signals ongoing recovery from economic hard times, adding to a sense of progress that the recent launching of riverboat gambling has given the city. And in the days leading to the match, the involvement of Nunn has lent an edge to life in this place, which is generally quiet save for an annual festival dedicated to another of the city's home-grown stars, jazz great Bix Beiderbecke.
 
On the Mound
 Friday night, things don't figure to be quiet for long.
Somewhere around 10:15 P.M., Central time, Nunn will bound up the steps of the stadium's first-base dugout and enter a ring laid out over the pitcher's mound. And if the weather is temperate and ticket sales go as expected, 9,000 to 10,000 fans, paying prices ranging between $25 and $200, will cheer Nunn on while the rest of the country catches the bout on a TVKO pay-per-view telecast that costs $19.95.
The 28-year-old Nunn, who said fighting in his hometown "means the world to me," is undefeated in 36 fights and, if he wins Friday, is expected to fight Nigel Benn next. Toney, a 22-year-old from Ann Arbor, Mich., who has been fighting professionally for only two and a half years, has 24 victories and a draw in 25 bouts. Tonight, Nunn weighed in at 160 pounds, and Toney at 157.
The pairing of this city -- one of the Quad Cities on the Iowa and Illinois sides of the Mississippi River -- and a prime-time fight has not been without complications. To set the match in motion, the advance men of promotor Bob Arum said they first had to knock down the local people's expectations of windfall prices for services rendered and materials delivered.
"They read about all the fancy numbers for Holyfield-Foreman and figured this was a grand chance for them," said Fred Berns, the on-site promotor for Arum.
 
Fight Game's Format
 Besides overcoming those economic preconceptions, Arum's men had to bring Davenport personnel up to speed on boxing logistics. O'Donnell Stadium personnel may know baseball, but as Jay Edson, site coordinator for Arum, discovered, they were fuzzy on staging a fight.
For instance, there was a question of where to house all the fighters for the night. Nunn and the co-featured Michael Carbajal, the I.B.F. light flyweight champion, will use the home-team clubhouse; their opponents, the visitors' clubhouse. Edson wanted two 60-foot trailers for the other preliminary combatants, but had to settle for two 30-foot trailers and a last-minute offer of two motor homes.
 But in Davenport, Edson has discovered adversity is mother to invention. "To get power for the trailers, we'll go through the ball park's scoreboard electric box," he said.
 
Difficult 80's
 If staging the fight in Davenport has meant complications for the promotor, it has been another story for the city. Staging a big-league fight here has primarily been an affirmation of an upturn in its fortunes. Like the other Quad Cities -- Bettendorf on the Iowa side and Moline and Rock Island on the Illinois side -- Davenport has had its share of hard times in the recent past.
"In the late 1970's and early 1980's, the farm economy went bad," said Joe Taylor, director of communications for the Quad Cities Convention and Visitors Bureau. "There were large surpluses and prices plummeted. Farmers were unable to buy farm equipment. And the plants that made that equipment were situated in the Quad Cities. We're talking about J.I. Case. John Deere. International Harvester. Farmall. The plants laid off workers, and some of them closed."
But Davenport is bouncing back, Taylor said. Yes, there are empty storefronts on some of the main streets and in the downtown, and yes, the reconstruction there is hardly finished. But for the civic leaders, Nunn's title defense here is viewed as one of many proofs of a resurgent economy.
The most conspicuous sign of a revitalized city is along River Drive. That's where four times a day the President Riverboat Casino pushes off from dockside and cruises along the Mississippi with a thousand or so customers trying their luck at slot machines and at table games like blackjack, craps and roulette.
Riverboat gambling is new here. On April 1, floating casinos began navigating the Mississippi in Bettendorf, Dubuque and Davenport. There's a $200-per-cruise limit to what a patron can lose, but that may change. Across the river in Illinois, it seems the Legislature has approved riverboat gambling, with no limit to what a consenting adult can lose.
After the Nunn-Toney bout was announced, John Connelly, owner of the President, bought $100,000 worth of tickets. That was in March. By this week, the activity and excitement for the fight was quickening. On Wednesday night, Monte Cox, sports editor of The Quad City Times, was putting the finishing touches on a 16-page fight supplement for Thursday. Bout posters appeared in stores and hotels in the Quad Cities.
"What this really is," Taylor said, emphasizing rising tourism figures, "is one more activity to draw visitors. Success breeds success."

Opulent pastries and high-octane coffee are featured at a new Austrian-style coffeehouse that opens today in the lobby of Avery Fisher Hall. The theatrical 90-seat cafe, with hand-painted murals depicting scenes from Mozart's operas as well as displays of costumes from famous Austrian operas, is a gift to Lincoln Center from the Federal Economic Chamber of Austria. The donation honors the center's current Mozart Bicentennial celebration, which continues through August 1992.
Cafe Vienna, which will be operated by Restaurant Associates, is open from 11:30 A.M. to well after evening performances at Lincoln Center. Patrons do not need event tickets to get in. The cafe is expected to remain open at least through August 1992, and perhaps permanently, said Richard Cattani, president of restaurant services for Restaurant Associates.
The cafe features a wide array of pastries, coffees, beer and wine. In the true European cafe tradition, there are wood slat newspaper racks around the dining room. But the newspapers are in German.

Aureole
With pricey haute cuisine restaurants toppling like power lines in a hurricane, how does one account for a place like Aureole? Opened in 1988, just as the economy was plummeting, it could have been heading into a maelstrom. Yet three years later, it remains one of the most vibrant and popular restaurants in New York City. 
 With a $55 prix fixe dinner, Aureole is on the high end of the price scale. Its unwavering success must be attributed to the top-notch service and the consistently captivating food of Charles Palmer, the chef and owner.
The restaurant is in a dramatic town house with a two-story front window that allows previews of the cream-toned walls adorned with plaster reliefs of wildlife. The downstairs dining room, all beige and accented with eruptions of colorful flowers, occasionally feels cramped when full; upstairs offers more privacy.
We started one evening with an array of savory little giveaways: shrimp tempura, pop-in-the-mouth beef Wellington and seared tuna on top of peppered pineapple. Mr. Palmer's signature appetizer, which remains as good as ever, is called sea scallop sandwich: perfectly seared sea scallops between layers of thin golden potatoes atop a lemony shellfish stock sauce.
Sweetbreads make a dynamic starter when lightly browned and set in a nest of mixed greens and asparagus tips with beignets of morels.
Aureole's Muscovy duck tasting is a varied teaser: lean but well-seasoned rillettes, an earthy pistachio-studded terrine, a silken foie gras terrine, excellent homemade duck sausage moistened with vinaigrette, and creamy (but bitter) duck liver mousse. If you find all this daunting, there is always the superb oak-smoked salmon served with cucumber salad and a dollop of double-cultured cream.
Waiters at Aureole have a professional bearing without being stiff. Like good basketball centers, they know when to float in and when to stay on the perimeter. You won't find many bargains on Aureole's wine list. A few California chardonnays and pinot noirs are worth looking at, though.
The kitchen has a sprightly touch with seafood, from sesame-crusted tuna with mushroom soy sauce and caramelized turnips to buttery sauteed halibut with ravioli of potato and green beans. The big hit at my table was seared salmon coated with three mustards accompanied by basil-braised artichokes and new potatoes.
Wood-grilled lamb chops come atop an earthy lentil cake and are surrounded by a ragout of oyster mushrooms and sweet caramelized onions -- a harmonious combination. Zestily seasoned peppered quails are served deboned over wild mushrooms and sauteed vegetables, along with a sweetish sweetbread pudding. I'd just as soon spend a summer weekend in the Holland Tunnel as eat kidneys, but the exceptionally mild ones served here with roasted pancetta, shallots and wild mushrooms in a Barolo wine reduction were indeed special.
Richard Leach, the pastry chef, should have his hands licensed as deadly weapons, like boxers. One seductive example of his handiwork is called a chocolate timbale, which has a chocolate cylinder filled with bittersweet chocolate mousse, anchored in exceptionally rich chocolate cake. Apple tart is ineffably light with its warm apples in its puff pastry crust with vanilla ice cream. Pear and pistachio layer cake was too sweet for my taste, but the pear sorbet with it was wonderful, as was the warm pear fritter.
In today's economy, Aureole may be a place that is frequented only on special occasions. If you are lucky enough to go there, though, special it should be.
 
Phoenix Garden
 The seedy, trash-strewn arcade off the Bowery in Chinatown hardly piques one's appetite. Those who venture within come across a lightning fast and obstreperous little place called Phoenix Garden, where some of the best Cantonese fare in New York City can be found.
Phoenix Garden is neither the friendliest nor the most comfortable restaurant in Chinatown. Upon entering the packed beige-toned dining room one evening we were ushered -- well, pushed really -- against a glass partition near the cash register by the aggressive hostess. When one woman in our party drifted from her designated spot, the hostess pummeled her on the arm until she returned.
Waiters here make delicatessen countermen look leisurely. "Beer?" "Beer?" "Beer?" asked three different waiters in quick succession. "Ready?" "Ready?" "Ready?" they inquired about two minutes after menus were presented. Finally, after about 10 minutes, the hostess took our orders when she felt we had used up sufficient time. Phoenix Garden is an easy place to despise -- but then there is that food.
We started with a light and wholesome soup of mustard greens and sliced pork that carried a kick of fresh ginger. The house specialty, called pepper and salty shrimp, is as heavenly as ever. Medium-sized shrimp are butterflied and amply seasoned with a yin-yang of salt and pepper, then cooked to light gold. A similar method works extraordinarily well with squid. Thin twirls of seasoned squid are delightfully crisp and tasty.
Crispy roasted squab with a sweet brittle skin and thin layer of fat is as addictive as candy. Another good light starter is stewed eggplant with ground ham served in a casserole.
All entrees come cascading out of the kitchen at once even if you ask for them staggered, so be ready, chopsticks up. Sea scallops smothered in moderately hot black pepper sauce with onions and garlic are tantalizing. So too is tender braised duck with mustard greens. A dish called sizzling chicken was dry because the moisture had evaporated during cooking. Much better was the complex combination of stewed beef flank with sweet turnips, mustard greens, garlic and lots of coriander.
The melange of mai-fun (rice noodles) and shrimp, sweet morsels of pork, green peppers, onions and bean sprouts, is right on target for texture and blending of flavors. Four-mushroom casserole was more impressive looking than it tasted. (It needed seasonings.) A seafood dish called lobster with satee sauce, a piquant blend of black pepper and curry, was an unqualified winner. Cut-up lobster, carefully cooked, came in an earthenware crock over clean cellophane noodles in a sweetish sauce tempered by the oceanic lobster juices.
When the last claw is cracked, out go the plates and in comes a chemical-tasting almond gelatin. Check . . slam . . . dunk . . . goodbye. For the first time, the hostess smiles.

HEADLINE: Soak the Rich? No. Help the Poor

 BODY:
Four senior Democrats, led by Senator Albert Gore and Representative Thomas Downey, proposed a bill to lower taxes on poor families with children and raise taxes on the very rich. That's a seductive combination: a way to play Robin Hood without costing the Treasury a dime.
But the proposal is also deceptively dangerous. To reap political favor, the sponsors would also shower tax benefits on a wide swath of the middle class. That's why their proposal requires piling tax hikes on six million rich families. 
 That invites -- begs -- wealthy investors to swarm all over Congress to reinstate the tax break for capital gains and recreate loopholes to protect themselves against the higher taxes.
The likely outcome is a deformed tax code, much like the one that existed before the 1986 tax reform. Tax rates were weighted in favor of the poor. But after taking account of the dodges, loopholes and shelters, rich and poor paid about the same proportion of their income to Washington. And the various deformations pushed investment into wasteful boondoggles.
 The Democratic sponsors make a compelling case for targeting tax relief to poor families. For more than a decade the working poor have suffered as their wages, measured after inflation, went down and their payroll taxes went up. And non-working poor parents have suffered from a 40 percent plunge in after-inflation welfare benefits.
The Downey-Gore bill would eliminate the existing personal deduction for children and substitute a child care tax credit worth $800 to every family, rich and poor. Families in the 15 percent tax bracket would save $455 per child; families in the 28 percent bracket would save $156 per child.
The bill would also boost the earned income tax credit, an income supplement for low-paid workers. The benefits for the poor would be dramatic: it would lift 600,000 families out of poverty; two million more families would owe no taxes.
But because every family would be eligible for the new tax credit, there would also be tax cuts for as many as 135 million Americans -- including families earning up to $75,000 a year. To pay for that, the bill would raise tax rates on upper income families, including a top rate of 38 percent on income above $250,000.
These proposed rates would pose no serious economic threat; they would still be lower than rates prevailing in much of Europe and in the U.S. before the Reagan Administration. But higher rates do pose a serious political threat.
The Democratic leadership has barely beaten back President Bush's attempts to cut the tax on capital gains -- during a period when the tax rate on the highest incomes ranged merely between 28 percent and 32. With a top rate near 40 percent, the opposition to Mr. Bush is quite likely to crumble.
A big boost in the top tax bracket would also push lawyers and accountants back into the business of creating wasteful tax shelters. The crowning glory of the 1986 reform was to eliminate the incentive to create dodges.
Messrs. Gore and Downey can solve the problem by targeting their tax cut. They could, for example, phase out the new child tax credit as family income rises. That way poor families would get an equitable boost and spare society any need to deform tax reform.

HEADLINE: Courage, Finally, on Gun Control

 BODY:
The customer shows up at the Ohio shop every couple of weeks looking for 9-millimeter semiautomatic handguns. He doesn't look like a local man, but he produces what looks like a valid local ID. So the dealer sells him the guns. He's not sure what the man does with all those 9-millimeters. But that's not his concern.
Eventually the man stops coming in, and the dealer learns that his best customer has been arrested. He's actually a resident of the Bronx who was getting rich selling guns from Ohio on the streets of New York City, where gun laws are strict. 
 The gun control bill that cleared the House of Representatives by a resounding margin on Wednesday would do much to stop such gun running -- and a lot of urban bloodshed as well. The vote was a welcome triumph of common sense over the bullying tactics of special interests. And it challenges the Senate to show similar fortitude.
The legislation would impose a national seven-day waiting period between the purchase and delivery of a handgun. It was introduced by Representative James Feighan, Democrat of Ohio, and named for James Brady, the former press secretary injured in the 1981 assassination attempt on President Reagan.
In addition to the waiting period, the bill requires that documents involved in the sale, including the purchaser's identification, be forwarded to local police. That gives them a chance to prevent illegal sales to felons, drug addicts, mental patients and purchasers from out of state.
The last group may be the most dangerous. Drug gangs and other criminals in cities with strong gun laws are commonly armed by smugglers who buy guns over the counter in other states and bring them home for resale on the black market -- at huge profits. Knowing that such out-of-state purchases will be routinely subjected to police scrutiny could have a powerful chilling effect.
The House vote marked a dramatic defeat for the National Rifle Association, which has for years invested heavily to prevent passage of the Brady bill. This time the gun lobby sought to parry the bill with a proposal for instant background checking at the point of sale. That was a cynical maneuver: the N.R.A. knew better than anyone that such a system would take years to set up and cost millions Washington doesn't have.
For once, enough lawmakers refused to be fooled or intimidated. Angry N.R.A. spokesmen now promise revenge in the 1992 elections. Such crude tactics could backfire. The bill's substantial margin of victory is due in part to representatives like Les AuCoin of Oregon, an N.R.A. supporter who changed his vote and publicly voiced his disgust with the gun lobby's heavy-handed approach.
Now it's the Senate's turn to show that it is capable of similar decency and courage. Senator Howard Metzenbaum of Ohio has introduced the Brady bill, and Senator George Mitchell of Maine, the majority leader, says he wants a stronger version that would combine a waiting period with development of a data base for instant background checking.
There is some reason to suspect Mr. Mitchell, from a state where gun control gets little sympathy, of another cynical scheme for an unworkable substitute. The House vote, however, makes that a highly dubious strategy. Now more than ever, the Brady bill looks like Washington's best response to the deadly spread of illegal guns.

CORRECTION-DATE: May 14, 1991, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
An editorial Friday misidentified the House sponsor of the gun legislation known as the Brady bill. He is Edward Feighan, Democrat of Ohio.

HEADLINE: Jerome P. Pickard, 74, Is Dead; Early Forecaster of Urban Spread

BYLINE: By GLENN FOWLER

 BODY:
Jerome P. Pickard, a geographer and a specialist in economic development who was senior adviser on demographics to the Appalachian Regional Commission for two decades, died on Monday at his summer home in Amagansett, L. I. He was 74 years old and also lived in Somerset, Md.
He died of heart failure, his family said. 
 In 1972, in a much-discussed report to the Federal Commission on Population Growth and the American Future, Dr. Pickard concluded that the urbanization of the United States was proceeding so rapidly that metropolitan governments would eventually have to be superseded by broader regional authorities to cover entities like the Atlantic Seaboard urban region. The Shenandoah National Park in Virginia, he said, would bear the same relationship to the seaboard region as Central Park bore to New York City in the 19th century.
Dr. Pickard, who was reared in Chicago, was a graduate of the University of Chicago and held advanced degrees from the University of Wisconsin and a doctorate from the Maxwell School at Syracuse University. He was a Fulbright scholar at the University of Oslo in Norway.
From 1954 to 1959 he served as research director for economic development at the Washington (D.C.) Board of Trade. Later he held similar posts at the Urban Land Institute and the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development. He joined the Appalachian Regional Commission in 1970 and retired last year.
Dr. Pickard taught regional development at George Washington University and was widely published in scholarly journals.
He is survived by his wife, Mildred; four daughters, Judith Lemieux of Montreal, Ruth Ann Running of St. Francis, S.D., Elizabeth Pickard of Lummi Island, Wash., and Susan Pickard of Madison, Wis., and six grandchldren.

Head of Quaker State Steps Down at Meeting

 BODY:
Quentin E. Wood, who rose during a 43-year career at the Quaker State Corporation from field engineer to chairman, resigned at the motor oil company's annual meeting yesterday. He will be succeeded by Jack W. Corn, who will also retain the title of chief executive.
Under Mr. Wood's leadership, as chief executive from 1975 to 1988 and chairman since 1982, Quaker State undwerwent a sizable expansion. From 1979 to 1986, sales increased from $292.9 million, to about $1 billion, and net income rose from $23.2 million, to $50 million. 
 Mr. Wood, 68 years old, attributed the growth, in part, to the acquisition of a string of assets, including the Valley Camp Coal Company, the Heritage Insurance Group and the Arctic Circle Corporation, which the company converted into a chain of 460 fast-lube service centers now known as Quaker State Minit-Lube.
Since 1986, the company, based in Oil City, Pa., has sold all its shallow crude oil wells, two of its refineries, its wax plant and its restaurant business. By the end of 1990, the company's sales had fallen to $874 million and net income was $19.6 million.
Mr. Wood said one of the most memorable accomplishments of his tenure was fending off an unsolicited $675 million takeover bid from Ardshiel Inc., an investor group, in 1988.
"During that period, when hostile takeovers were so prevalent, Quaker State was on the list of every corporate raider," Mr. Wood said. "I'm very proud of the fact that I was able to keep Quaker State independent."
Mr. Wood, who will remain a director at Quaker State, is leaving the chairman's office at another critical time in the history of the company, as it battles the debilitating effects of the recession, the sluggish automotive market and the operational problems that have plagued two of its coal mines.
The company reported that net income fell 88.4 percent in the first quarter, to $269,000, or 1 cent a share, compared with $2.3 million, or 9 cents a share, in the comparable period of 1990. Sales fell 9.8 percent, to $188.5 million, compared with $209 million.
Mr. Wood joined Quaker State on July 1, 1948, less than a month after he graduated from Pennsylvania State University with a bachelor of science degree in petroleum and natural gas engineering. He rose from field engineer to chief engineer of the product division, to manager, to vice president, to corporate director and then to president, the job he took in 1973. He relinquished the position of chief executive to Mr. Corn in 1988.
He and his wife, Louise, will continue to divide their time between Oil City and Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla. They are avid golfers and tennis players and are planning trips later this year to Ireland and Scotland. "I feel ready to step aside and relax a little bit," Mr. Wood said.

HEADLINE: Brazil's Economy Chief Out; Envoy to U.S. Gets the Post

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, May 9

 BODY:
Pressed by a deep recession, stubborn inflation and restive foreign creditors, President Fernando Collor de Mello today replaced Zelia Cardoso de Mello as Economy Minister, traditionally Brazil's second most powerful Government post, with Brazil's Ambassador to the United States.
As Marcilio Marques Moreira prepared to take office on Friday, Ms. Cardoso's economic team, including the president of the central bank and the nation's foreign debt negotiator, resigned. 
 In making the change, Mr. Collor replaced youth with experience, and radical home-grown solutions with orthodox, internationally acceptable remedies. Business executives here hailed the move.
Ms. Cardoso, Brazilian-trained and 37 years old, was a virtually unknown college professor when Mr. Collor named her Economy Minister, the first woman in Brazil's history to occupy the post.
Ms. Cardoso ordered radical measures, including freezing most bank accounts, and Brazil's economy shrank 6 percent in her first year in office. When inflation returned to 20 percent a month in January, she imposed wage and price controls, Brazil's fourth such experience in four years.
In a demonstration of disaffection with Government policies, shopkeepers increased the supposedly frozen prices by 40 percent in the last three months.
Universally known here as Zelia, Ms. Cardoso disrupted the Government in October when she made public her affair with Bernardo Cabral, then Minister of Justice. Mr. Cabral, who is married, was forced to resign. Ms. Cardoso, who is single, retained her post.
Her replacement, Mr. Moreira, 59, is a discreet former bank director with 34 years of experience with the United States and a penchant for orthodox, negotiated approaches to economic problems.
"Marcilio brings a key ingredient: credibility," Joel Korn, who is head of Bank of America operations in Brazil said today. "He brings maturity. He has developed an extremely good rapport with the international community."
The son of a career diplomat, Mr. Moreira grew up in Europe and Rio de Janeiro, where he studied law. Fluent in English, Mr. Moreira lived in Washington from 1957 to 1963, where he worked as first secretary in Brazil's Embassy and earned a master's degree in political science from Georgetown University.
At the embassy, Mr. Moreira's mentor was Roberto Campos, then-ambassador and later architect of Brazil's economic boom of the late 1960's.
 
Business Experience Stressed
 Speaking today of his former protege, Mr. Campos, now a congressman, said, "Marcilio has what Collor's team has lacked so far: business experience and international negotiating experience."
Before becoming Brazil's Ambassador to the United States in 1986, Mr. Moreira worked for Unibanco, Brazil's fifth-largest private banking group, rising to become a board member.
"Marcilio is well respected, both as a banker and as a diplomat," William R. Rhodes, a Citibank executive who has led the negotiating committee of Brazil's creditor banks, said today. "He has some of the best connections of any ambassador in Washington."
Reacting favorably to his appointment, the trading price of Brazilian debt paper rose 1.25 cents, to 28.25 cents, on London's secondary debt market.
 
Visit to U.S. in June
 In Washington, the appointment is expected to smooth President Collor's state visit to the United States next month. Reknowned for her abrasive personality, Ms. Cardoso tangled in recent weeks with American officials over Brazil's slow progress on renegotiating its $60 billion foreign debt.
Several business people cautioned that Mr. Moreira would have to name a seasoned team in order to make progress against Brazil's entrenched economic problems.
Today, two members of the new team were named: Francisco Gross, nominee for the presidency of the central bank, replacing Ibrahim Eris, and Joao Santana, new Minister of Infrastructure, succeeding Eduardo Teixeira.
Jorio Dauster, special ambassador for foreign debt negotiations, resigned today but was expecterd to complete negotiations in the next few weeks over Brazil's rescheduling of back due interest on its foreign debt.
In late April, the two protagonists of today's drama displayed radically different styles and spirits in separate interviews in Brasilia.
 
Complexity Acknowledged
 Ms. Cardoso, interviewed in her fifth floor office in the Economy Ministry, appeared tense, tired and irritable.
"The problems were more complex than we imagined when we were out of government," acknowledged the minister, whose elegant lime green business suit and cherry red lipstick contrasted with her gray frame of mind.
On the other side of Brasilia's grassy central mall, at the Foreign Ministry building, Mr. Moreira was the picture of a seasoned diplomat. Balding, dressed in a dark blue suit, he outlined in soft tones the agenda of President Collor's visit to Washington.

HEADLINE: Your Money;
School Vacation Tax Advantages

BYLINE: By Jan M. Rosen

 BODY:
With school holidays approaching, single parents and working couples with young children are scrambling to arrange for their care, while many older students are looking for summer jobs. Both situations can offer opportunities for tax savings.
Working people who pay for child care may be able to take a credit that reduces income taxes dollar for dollar. For people with adjusted gross incomes of $28,000 or more, the maximum is $480 for one child and $960 for two or more, but it is higher for lower-income people -- 30 percent of the money spent up to $4,800 for two or more children for people with incomes below $10,000. 
 To qualify, taxpayers must provide the Social Security number or taxpayer identification number of the person or institution providing the care. The children must be under age 13, and the amount spent cannot exceed the earnings of the lower-income spouse. Only day care is eligible, not overnight camp.
"I advise clients that they have to be sure everything is documented with respect to the care given," said Avery E. Neumark, a partner in the accounting firm of Weber, Lipshie & Company in New York. Sometimes, he said, people feel that if the child attends a camp sponsored by a religious organization, the money paid ought to be deductible as a charitable gift, but he points out that it is not. "It's the same principle as tuition," he said.
A dependent care assistance plan may be even better than the tax credit for families with income above $32,000, Mr. Neumark said. It may be either a stand-alone plan provided by the employer or paid through an employee salary-reduction plan -- that is, a flexible spending account or "cafeteria" plan in which up to $5,000 of compensation can be set aside on a pretax basis for child care. Self-employed people may also be able to set up a flexible spending account. People must choose between the credit and the dependent care plan, Mr. Neumark said, adding, "You can't double-dip."
For a family in a 40 percent marginal bracket for combined Federal, state and local taxes, that would provide a direct tax benefit of $2,000. And with personal exemptions and itemized deductions being phased out for upper-income taxpayers, it helps by lowering adjusted gross income.
Companies normally give employees an opportunity once a year to elect to take part in a flexible spending plan. For those with a June 30 fiscal year, elections may be possible now, said Mr. Neumark, who is also an adjunct professor at the Fordham Graduate School of Business.
An important consideration when the person providing the care is a household employee is that employers must pay their share of Social Security and Medicare taxes, which together equal 7.65 percent, and often state unemployment taxes.
For high school and college students, summer work can be rewarding in a number of ways, and parents are often surprised to learn that it may be tax-free.
"There is a misconception that the kiddie tax is all-encompassing," said Julian Block, a Larchmont, N.Y., tax lawyer and author. That tax applies only to unearned income like dividends and interest paid to children under age 14. Amounts above $1,100 this year are taxed at the parents' rate.
But earned income is taxable at the child's rate, he noted, and with the $3,400 standard deduction in 1991, young people may earn that much and owe no taxes. Earnings above that are taxable at 15 percent, up to $19,450. Parents who provide more than half a child's support may still claim the dependency exemption.
William J. Goldberg, partner in KPMG Peat Marwick in Houston, advised students to "give your employer the address where you are going to be in January," when employers mail out W-2's. Taxes will generally be withheld, and the student will have to file a return with the W-2 attached to get a refund, he said. When students are away at school, the matter sometimes slips through the cracks, he said.
Mr. Block said, "A family that has its own business can hire the child for the summer." For example, he hired his daughter, a college student, to file and type letters. "The break is that you can shift some income," he said, and the student can learn about the business or profession and decide whether to enter it after graduation.
Sole proprietors and husband-wife partnerships are not required to withhold Social Security taxes for children under age 18, he said. But it is important to keep thorough records of wages and hours, he added, and "you can pay no more than you would pay an unrelated employee for the same work." Also, it must be legitimate work within the child's competence.
Of course, Mr. Neumark noted, "Summer plans shouldn't be contingent on deductibility of costs." He added: "If children have an opportunity to work on a kibbutz in Israel or study a foreign language in Switzerland, they shouldn't be deterred. The experience may be worth a lot more than a tax deduction."

HEADLINE: Luxury Tax Under Attack

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 10

 BODY:
Repeal of the luxury tax on expensive cars is a top priority of the American International Automobile Dealers Association, the group's president, Walter Huizenga, said today.
"I've yet to find one member of Congress who says this is sound tax policy," Mr. Huizenga said at a news conference as the group prepared to begin its annual legislative meeting here on Monday. The association represents more than 9,700 foreign-car dealers. 
 Members will also lobby against pending legislation requiring significant fuel-economy improvements and allowing the Bush Administration to negotiate a free-trade pact with Mexico, he said.
The luxury tax was imposed last fall as part of the five-year deficit-reduction law. The tax -- 10 percent of a car's purchase price above $30,000 -- was viewed as a way to get more money from the rich, Mr. Huizenga said. Instead, he said, it has combined with the recession to cut luxury car sales 45 percent in the first quarter.
The dealership closings that resulted have have put 3,700 dealers, mechanics and others out of work, he said, and many more people will lose their jobs unless the tax is rescinded.

HEADLINE: Washington Bank Seized

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 10

 BODY:
Federal bank regulators today seized the Madison National Bank, one of the largest in the Washington area, after declaring it insolvent.
Madison is to be sold to Signet Bank for $18 million. 
 Banking officials estimated that the failure of Madison would ultimately cost the fund that insures deposits almost $150 million. All depositors, even those with uninsured accounts of more than $100,000, will be protected. Madison's shareholders will lose their investments.
The move caps three years of problems at the bank, which had an unusually high concentration of loans for real estate and construction and had been unable to comply with regulatory standards.
Trying to keep Madison afloat, regulators last year permitted the bank to borrow heavily from the Federal Reserve. But the borrowing could not offset the mounting losses on loans to real estate developers and to many of the bank's executives, and the losses eventually exceeded the bank's capital.
"The downturn in the local economy contributed to the bank's problems," the office of the Comptroller of the Currency said in a statement released today. "But Madison National Bank's poor underwriting standards, including making unsecured real estate loans, providing 100 percent financing of real estate projects, and lending based on character rather than cash flow, were major causes of the bank's failure."
The banking company is the sixth largest in Washington. It had assets of $529 million as of Dec. 31.

HEADLINE: NWA Has Loss of $62 Million

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: EAGAN, Minn., May 10

 BODY:
NWA Inc., the parent of Northwest Airlines, said today that it lost $62 million in the first quarter of 1991. It attributed the results to higher fuel prices and lower traffic caused by the recession and the Persian Gulf war.
The loss compared with a $39 million loss a year earlier. The privately held company reported its financial results in a filing required by the Department of Transportation. 
 Operating revenues in the quarter were $1.64 billion, compared with $1.63 billion for the first quarter of 1990, a 1 percent increase, Northwest said. But quarterly operating expenses were $1.76 billion, compared with $1.72 billion a year earlier, a 2 percent increase.
John Dasburg, president and chief executive, said the first quarter "typically produces a loss because of traditionally lower travel demand."
The airline, the nation's fourth largest, suffered a $10 million net loss for 1990, compared with a $355 million profit in 1989. The 1990 figure included a $121 million net loss in the fourth quarter, which the airline said resulted from the Persian Gulf crisis.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
The Dollar Is Mostly Down; Gold Prices Show Declines

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell yesterday against all leading currencies except the Japanese yen in quiet trading on world currency markets.
Gold prices declined worldwide. On the New York Commodity Exchange, bullion for current delivery settled at $357.10 an ounce, down $1 from Thursday. The Republic National Bank said gold slipped 85 cents an ounce, to $356.75. 
 Currency dealers said activity was uneventful, with the dollar holding to a relatively narrow trading range.
The dollar got a slight lift early in the session following the Labor Department's report that producer prices rose in April for the first time in five months. The report was interpreted favorably as a sign that inflation was being kept at bay. But because the increase was within expectations, traders said it had no more than a brief impact on the dollar.
"I don't think the fundamentals in the United States justify a sustained upward move for the dollar, so we're in a consolidation mode," said Earl Johnson, a vice president at the Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago.
Mr. Johnson said there was some talk about interest rate cuts in Europe next week, possibly in Italy and Spain, which could give the dollar a slight lift. But traders are also awaiting the release of fresh data on the American economy, including figures for industrial production, consumer prices, business inventories and merchandise trade.
In Tokyo, the dollar rose to a closing 138.58 Japanese yen from 138.23 yen at Thursday's close. Later, in London, it rose to 138.70 yen. In New York, the dollar settled at 138.70 yen, up from 138.10 yen on Thursday.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.7195, from $1.7045 late Thursday. In New York, it cost $1.7245 to buy 1, more expensive than Thursday's $1.7175.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday's rates, included: 1.7230 German marks, down from 1.7325; 1.4550 Swiss francs, down from 1.4630; 5.8280 French francs, down from 5.8585; 1,275.00 Italian lire, down from 1,280.25, and 1.1514 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1526.
Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $356.80 a troy ounce, from $356.95 late Thursday. In Zurich, the metal fell to a closing bid of $356.50, from $356.65 on Wednesday. Markets were closed Thursday for the Ascension Day holiday.
Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 53 cents to close at a bid $357.67.
Silver prices also lost ground. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current delivery settled at $4.024 a troy ounce, down from $4.050 on Thursday. In London the metal slipped to a late bid price of $4.04 an ounce from $4.07.

HEADLINE: Stocks Wilt in Fallout From Treasury Sale

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
Stocks fell sharply late yesterday, more than erasing Thursday's strong gains. Traders attributed the slide to plunging bond prices.
The Dow, relentlessly tumbling minute by minute throughout the day, sank 50.98 points, or 1.7 percent, to 2,920.17. 
 Ironically, Wall Street traced both Thursday's rise and yesterday's fall to the same thing -- the Treasury's $37 billion refinancing. [Page 38.]
"The stock market rose 40 points on Thursday because we were all so relieved the refunding went so well," said Robert T. Falconer, senior vice president and economist of Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, a leading bond dealer.
"Today," he added, "the stock market dropped 50 points because we realized we had one devil of a bad refunding. Investors didn't show up, and dealers were selling unwanted inventories, and prices plunged."
The blue-chip index also lost 18.69 points for the week, but because of a couple of strong gains earlier in the week, the five-day loss was small.
Showing that yesterday's decline was widespread, the broader-based Standard & Poor's index of the top 500 stocks slid almost 2 percent.
Trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange, turning a bit sluggish, dropped to 172.7 million shares, from 180.2 million the day before. Big Board declines, though, led advances by well over 2 to 1.
In one of the wildest computer-driven selling frenzies, Birinyi Associates, which tracks program trading, said that 10 separate waves of program selling chopped slightly more than 68 points off the Dow. Close to 20 points of the decline came in three big waves between 12:45 and 1:04 P.M.
To prevent the selling from feeding on itself and driving the market down further, the Big Board intervened at 3:23 P.M. -- imposing its so-called 50-point rule for the first time since the middle of last month.
Under the rule, program traders are not permitted to sell unless the price of the stock is the same as or more than the previous price. A similar procedure is used to regulate program buying. While it does not eliminate program trading, imposing the rule almost always halts it.
 
 'A Mammoth Mountain of Bonds'

Explaining what happened, Mr. Falconer said: "There's a mammoth mountain of bonds, and the indigestion you're seeing is that dealers have more than they wanted. And to reduce their holdings -- to encourage institutional investors to buy them -- they've had to lower prices."
When the Treasury needs money, it auctions bonds through a network of primary dealers, who, in turn, resell them to the big investors, like insurers and investment funds.
When dealers studied the resale potential Thursday, in advance of yesterday's Producer Price Index data, the figures were expected to be favorable enough for them to unload the bulk of their inventory.
"We got good numbers," Mr. Falconer said. "They showed inflation slowing. But they were not good enough to ignite buying. And in the absence of buying, you have unwanted inventories."
He explained that dealers would not hold on to inventory because of the risk that interest rates could go up, forcing prices down, "so dealers mark them down."
Further complicating an already difficult day, wild rumors -- regarded now as unfounded -- circulated that California insurance regulators were liquidating a bond portfolio owned by First Capital Holdings, a company 28 percent owned by American Express and its Shearson subsidiary.
Other rumors, discounted as ridiculous, circulated that a bond dealer had failed. There appeared to be little doubt, though, that the bond community had sustained big losses on the refinancing.
Declines among the Dow stocks were widespread.

HEADLINE: Dutch Export Violator Barred on Sales to U.S.

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 10

 BODY:
The Defense Department has for the first time banned a company from doing business with any Federal agency because it reportedly exported high-technology products in violation of American export controls.
The Defense Logistics Agency suspended a Dutch company from bidding for Government contracts after the early results from investigations by the Defense, State and Commerce departments indicated that it had shipped American night-vision equipment to Iraq without first obtaining the Government's permission. 
 The company, Delft Instruments N.V., has been a large seller of medical equipment to the Government, and is now barred from these contracts.
 
 Found on Iraqi Troops
 Some of the night-vision equipment sold by Delft was found on dead and captured Iraqi troops after a battle in Khafji, Saudi Arabia. A night attack by Iraqi forces surprised allied forces there, who had underestimated the Iraqi night-fighting capabilities, and resulted in significant casualties among allied Arab forces.
The suspension represents a hardening of Defense Department policy in the debate over whether the United States should try to increase exports with potential military applications now that the Soviet Union represents a dwindling military threat. The debate pits business and Government officials concerned about the nation's waning economic fortunes against military and civilian officials who want the United States to retain the technological advantage that gave it an easy victory in Kuwait.
 
More Caution Seen

The Defense Department's action against Delft "is new, and it is going to put a lot of companies on edge," said Laura A. Gubisch, the export controls expert at the American Association of Exporters and Importers. Businesses that rely heavily on Government contracts may become even more cautious about what they allow any of their subsidiaries to export, she added. Violators of American export control statutes are already subject to civil and criminal sanctions.
The logistics agency justified the suspension by citing its military acquisition regulations, which are normally used to bar companies for fraud or bribery. The regulations technically allow the Defense Department to suspend any company deemed to have behaved irresponsibly, and the logistics agency decided that a violation of export controls qualified as irresponsible behavior.
The logistics agency explicitly banned Delft from Defense Department contracts. But under a little-known law, a company deemed irresponsible by any single Federal agency is automatically barred from doing business with any other agency of the executive branch.
The Defense Logistics Agency took action against Delft at the request of the Defense Technology Security Agency, said a Defense Department official who spoke on condition of anonymity. The security agency, which seeks to prevent the leakage of American military secrets to foreign powers, has not previously tried to bar companies from doing business with the Government.
Vincent Cusack, the president of the Oldelft Corporation of America, the American arm of Delft Industries, did not return telephone calls seeking comment. Oldelft had sales of $30 million last year, its first year of operation.
The Defense Department's move against Delft, which went into effect without announcement on May 2, may make it much more difficult for companies to export militarily sensitive products, said Stephen D. Bryen, who was the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for trade security policy from 1981 to 1988 and now runs a small computer software company.
 
Tougher on Curbs

"The Defense Department is more likely to impose these constraints than the Commerce Department, which has not been strong on these sanctions," Mr. Bryen said. The promotion of exports is one of the Commerce Department's main tasks.
A Commerce Department official said his agency had no objection to the Defense Department's action because the night-vision equipment involved was intended for military use. The equipment was on a Government list of munitions that are subject to strict export controls and not on the broader list of technologies with both civilian and military applications, he added. "Honest exporters have nothing to worry about," said the official, who insisted on anonymity.

HEADLINE: Mild Rise in Producer Price Index

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 10

 BODY:
Prices of finished goods as they left the factory rose a mild two-tenths of 1 percent in April, the Labor Department reported today. The report was fresh evidence that the recession is taking the steam out of inflation.
The rise in prices that manufacturers charge for goods sold to wholesalers and distributors was the first after four months of declines. But the increase resulted mostly from flukes in two areas -- fresh vegetables and tobacco products -- rather than from strong demand driving up prices, said Craig Howell, chief for producer prices at the department's Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
 "When you analyze all the items, there is no sign yet of a pickup in the general economy," he said.
 
 Effect on the Fed

The report today and the April performance of the Consumer Price Index, to be released on Tuesday, are likely to ratify the Federal Reserve's decision last week to reduce interest rates to fight the recession. A regular meeting of the Fed's policy makers, known as the Federal Open Market Committee, is set for Tuesday, and the inflation numbers are likely to be a prime topic.
Those Fed officials who had pushed within the central bank for the April 30 rate reductions had expressed the hope then that the two April inflation numbers would be weak enough to help justify the rate cuts when all 17 policy makers held their meeting next week. Some economists also suggested that weak April inflation numbers might prompt the policy makers to favor lowering interest rates another notch to stimulate the economy, although there is skepticism on this point on Wall Street.
"We are seeing some inflation dividend out of the recession," said Richard B. Berner, chief economist at Salomon Brothers. "Now the issue is whether we will sustain the apparently lower level of inflation."
 
 The Core Rate

Through April, the Producer Price Index for Finished Goods has risen only 3.2 percent in a year. That is roughly half the annual rate of increase in the final months of last year. Even excluding volatile food and energy prices -- to get at what economists consider the core rate of inflation -- the index has risen a relatively mild 3.7 percent in the last 12 months. The April increase, without food and energy, was also two-tenths of 1 percent.
Consumer prices -- almost always higher than producer prices because they include the cost of health care and other services -- have declined since late last year, but not as sharply as producer prices. The March Consumer Price Index showed a decline of one-tenth of 1 percent, the first monthly drop since 1986. The 12-month rate of increase through March was 4.9 percent.
Among producer goods ready for consumption, three items -- fresh vegetables, tobacco products and prescription drugs -- rose with unexpected sharpness. The increases in vegetable prices -- onions up 83 percent, sweet corn 36 percent and tomatoes 29 percent, for example -- came because spring supplies from California that usually appear in quantity by April failed to do so this year, Mr. Howell said.
Tobacco product prices, usually increased by the industry at the beginning and in the middle of each year, rose 2.7 percent in April, perhaps reflecting concerns arising from various legal actions against tobacco companies, Mr. Howell said. Prescription drugs rose 2.3 percent, an unusual jump for a product category in which the average price has risen 8.6 percent in the last year. The drug companies cited research and development costs, Mr. Howell said.
The prices of nearly all other items either rose only mildly, or fell. Men's, women's and children's apparel, for example, all rose three-tenths of 1 percent or less, the Labor Department reported. Light trucks, cars, books, computers, dies, textile machinery and most other types of capital equipment all fell in price, with light trucks down 2.2 percent and cars two-tenths of 1 percent.
While the Producer Price Index rose, two other indexes fell. One, measuring the prices of intermediate goods like flour, synthetic fibers, leather and car parts, fell four-tenths of 1 percent in April, the fifth monthly decline. The other, measuring crude goods prices for products like wheat, cattle hides, leaf tobacco and logs, dropped five-tenths of 1 percent in April, the third monthly decline.
The indexes say the recession continued in April, said Joel Popkin, a consultant, "but the decline in the prices of things that producers buy is not yet reflected in what retailers charge for consumer goods."

HEADLINE: Detroit's Assault on Mileage Bill

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, May 10

 BODY:
The American auto industry, a perennial straggler in Washington regulatory battles, has been waging an uncharacteristically effective fight against proposed legislation to make cars and trucks much more fuel efficient.
The focus of the campaign is a bill sponsored by Senator Richard H. Bryan, a Nevada Democrat, that would raise the corporate average fuel-economy standard, known as CAFE, to 40 miles a gallon, from the current 27.5, over 10 years. The Bryan bill has cleared the Senate Commerce Committee and awaits action by the full Senate. Similar bills have been proposed in the House. 
 Auto makers contend that if the bill became law, it would shoehorn Americans into tiny cars akin to today's Geo Metro and eliminate production of full-size models. President Bush, whose economic advisers prefer a market approach to reducing fuel consumption, has promised to veto the measure.
 
 Supporters Back Off
 As industry pressure against the bill has grown more intense, even some of the bill's original supporters are beginning to back away. One of its co-sponsors, Senator Dale Bumpers, Democrat of Arkansas, has said he is no longer sure the bill's efficiency goals are feasible.
But even if the Bryan bill fails, auto makers fear that fuel-efficiency initiatives will permanently remain on Congress's agenda.
In the past, Detroit's efforts in Washington have mostly been limited to lobbying, and more often than not, the attempts have fallen flat. But this time, the industry has geared up a grass-roots lobbying and education effort, called the Coalition for Vehicle Choice, to argue against far-reaching fuel-efficiency standards.
Headed by Diane Steed, a former head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the lobbying group has attracted constituencies as diverse as tool and die makers, cattlemen and campground owners, who are willing to rally around the comfort and hauling capacity of the large car and truck. "Traditionally, debates like this have been between Congress and the auto industry," said Ron DeFore, a spokesman for the coalition. "We think we are making a tremendous difference."
Environmental and conservation groups disagree with Detroit, producing studies suggesting that technological changes could significantly improve fuel efficiency without sacrificing much of the size or usefulness of vehicles.
"The auto industry has been crying wolf for decades," said Dan Becker, the Sierra Club's director of energy programs. "Back in 1974, when the first CAFE bill was being discussed, Ford said we'd all be driving Pintos and Mavericks if it got passed." The Sierra Club asserts that the Bryan bill will save the country 2.5 million barrels of oil a day and that vehicles will remain about the same size.
The Center for Auto Safety, a nonprofit research foundation that is often critical of auto makers, published a report last month suggesting that safety would not be compromised by strict economy standards. Its findings contradict those of the Department of Transporation, which said the Bryan bill would lead to smaller cars and more highway deaths. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, which is supported by the insurance industry, agrees.
The auto industry's grass-roots and special-interest organizing infuriates the opposition, which has used similar tactics in the name of tougher regulation. Clarence M. Ditlow, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, dismissed the Coalition for Vehicle Choice as "an industry front that only gives the appearance of a broad-based coalition." And Mr. Ditlow accused Ms. Steed of "weakening fuel-efficiency standards when she was in charge of N.H.T.S.A."
 
 Under Study by Experts

Most lawmakers lack the technical expertise to evaluate which side is right, so the Department of Transportation has enlisted a committee of the National Academy of Sciences to determine what standards are technically and economically feasible. The panel hopes to submit its findings by June 30, although the process could drag through the summer.
The crux of the auto makers' brief is that average fuel efficiency has doubled since 1975 and that few technological innovations remain that could bolster efficiency as quickly as the Bryan bill would require. Indeed, the size and weight of the average car has shrunk since 1975, and fuel efficiency has doubled. As cars and engines got smaller, Detroit says, many consumers simply switched to roomier trucks and truck-like vehicles, which conform to more liberal fuel-efficiency standards.
Most cars already have front-wheel drive, which reduces weight and delivers power to the wheels more efficiency, and enhanced aerodynamics, which reduces wind resistance. Adding refinements to those designs and other improvements, like tire innovations, will gradually raise the fleet average, but not by the 40 percent envisioned by the Bryan bill over the next decade, auto makers say.
The politics of CAFE are complex and only partly related to the question of whether imposing fuel efficiency on auto makers effectively promotes conservation. Although the Bush Administration damaged the Bryan bill's chances for passage by promising a veto, the bill's backers hold something the Administration wants: support for expanded oil and gas drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska.
Lobbyists and political strategists say the Administration may be willing to trade support for higher fuel-efficiency standards in return for expanded drilling rights in Alaska. Such a swap could be carried out in an energy bill sponsored by Senators J. Bennett Johnston, Democrat of Louisiana, and Malcolm Wallop, Republican of Wyoming. That bill is being debated in the Senate.
Lawmakers, Administration officials and those trying to increase economy standards concede privately that higher gasoline taxes are vital to reducing consumption. But rather than impose a direct tax on constituents, lawmakers like Mr. Bryan prefer that auto makers raise prices to pay for technological breakthroughs.
The auto makers decline to say what increase in CAFE would be technically and economically feasible. They want the power to raise fuel-efficiency standards assigned to the Transportation Department, rather than let Congress decide them. The law, therefore, would force auto makers to improve fuel efficiency continually, but in small increments that the Secretary of Transportation would control. Detroit thinks those rules would be easier to take.

HEADLINE: Focusing on Welfare

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 10

 BODY:
President Bush has struck a partisan blow against critics who accuse him of having no domestic policy: He has denounced Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society. By doing so he also invigorated a national debate about what type of social welfare programs the nation needs, and how effective other Presidents have been in combating poverty and racial bias.
The heart of the debate is political. Mr. Bush delivered his rebuff in a speech at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor last Saturday, laying a foundation for domestic policy debate in the 1992 Presidential campaign. He knows that many voters share his opposition to racial quotas, and he knows there are few votes to be had in defending welfare recipients. 
 Mr. Bush's comments on the Great Society came in an address in which he warned that free speech rights were under assault on many college campuses. The President defended both free speech and "freedom of spirit," saying the Great Society had discouraged individuals from performing good works by overemphasizing the role of Government in social policy.
Mr. Bush said Johnson's crusade against poverty had backfired, saying its civil rights programs had "generated animosity" and its welfare programs had made poor people dependent on Government.
 
Embedded in Social Fabric
 In his remarks, Mr. Bush ignored the fact that much of the Great Society has been accepted and embedded in the nation's social fabric: Federal aid for elementary and secondary schools, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the Fair Housing Act of 1968, Medicare for the elderly, Medicaid for the poor, a nationwide food stamp program, automobile safety and consumer protection laws.
The President's speech pointedly omitted any praise for Great Society programs that Mr. Bush has lauded, like Head Start and a number of environmental laws. Perhaps unintentionally, Mr. Bush's comments revived debate over the merit of those programs. Supporters of the Great Society say it drastically reduced the number of poor people. Critics insist that it fostered a culture of dependency.
The President's criticism of the Great Society was sweeping and unqualified. But Mr. Bush's main speechwriter, Tony Snow, who drafted the address, acknowledged in an interview that the Bush Administration's judgment of the Great Society was actually more complex and nuanced than the speech suggested.
Mr. Snow, 35 years old, a former editor of the editorial page at The Washington Times, said he had been troubled to hear radio reports that Mr. Bush had attacked the Great Society. Mr. Bush conceded that "the ideals behind the Great Society were noble," but he said the programs were not "up to the task," and he concluded that "we need to rethink our approach" to poverty and discrimination.
Mr. Bush, in his speech, sought to lay the groundwork for the Republican domestic agenda in the 1992 Presidential campaign, a campaign in which Republicans will assail Democrats as members of the party of old ideas.
Mr. Bush's indictment of the Great Society surprised some experts. Joseph A. Califano Jr., for instance, who worked for Johnson at the White House from 1965 through 1968, said, "Mr. Bush doesn't know his history."
 
'Redistribute Opportunity'
 In a telephone interview from London, Mr. Califano said, "The goal of the Great Society was to redistribute opportunity and wealth and to empower poor people."
Empowerment is a theme in vogue among Bush appointees like Housing Secretary Jack F. Kemp and James P. Pinkerton, a White House policy planner. And Mr. Bush has often alluded to the notion that poor people should have more control over public housing and other Government benefits.
Mr. Bush delivered his speech at the site where Johnson articulated his vision of the Great Society 27 years ago. Speaking in a time of prosperity and economic growth, Johnson said, "We have the opportunity to move not only toward the rich society and the powerful society, but upward to the Great Society," and he declared his commitment to end poverty and racial injustice "in our time."
What Johnson did not envision was that the Vietnam War would eat up so much of the nation's resources.
Nonetheless, by virtually all accounts, the Great Society helped improve the lives and financial security of the elderly, in part through a big increase in Social Security benefits. By most accounts, Medicare and Medicaid have succeeded in providing health care for the elderly and the poor, though at far greater cost than Johnson could ever have imagined.
 
A Question of Dependency
 But there has been bitter debate over whether the Great Society's main cash welfare program, Aid to Families With Dependent Children, tends to foster dependency. Timothy M. Smeeding, a professor of economics at Syracuse University, is among those who say it does.
But Greg J. Duncan, a professor of economics at the University of Michigan who has followed the income of 7,500 families for two decades, said: "There is no evidence from our data that dependency is any greater problem now than in the early 1970's, when Great Society programs reached their peak. There is no evidence of an increase in the proportion of children dependent on welfare."
In the speech, Mr. Bush proposed to replace the Great Society with a "good society," in which individuals perform private acts of common decency, becoming "points of light." Mr. Bush's speech and his domestic policy indicate that his vision of Government's role in fighting poverty is much more modest than Johnson's; it omits the idea of the Government as helper and savior that inspired Johnson.

HEADLINE: Rates Climb in an Unsettled Market

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
Long-term interest rates soared yesterday as the Treasury securities market was unsettled by fact and rumor. After shrugging off a modest rise in the April Producer Price Index, dealers began shaving prices of Treasury notes and bonds they had bought at this week's quarterly refunding auction.
Given the less than enthusiastic bidding for the 30-year bonds that wrapped up the auctions on Thursday and the tepid response to the note sale the previous day, dealers said they wanted to cut their inventory before the weekend. 
 Also during the morning, the Treasury debt market was buoyed by the residual buying occasioned by the covering of short positions taken by dealers and other prospective bidders as a hedge against a decline in the value of the securities they plan to bid for.
 
 Rumor From California

But the price shaving turned to price slashing late in the session on a rumor that California had ordered the liquidation of the large bond portfolio of the First Capital Life Insurance Company. State officials said later that options being discussed with outside directors of First Capital Holdings, the insurer's parent, included the reduction of the "junk bond" portfolio,
"Normally the rumor would have not had much effect, except that it was Friday afternoon and the market wanted to forget the refunding and go home," said Alan R. Leslie, chief economist at the Discount Corporation of New York. "As for the refunding, it wasn't as terrible as some had predicted before the auction. Even after today's selloff, the long bond's yield is well below the yield of 8.40 that many in the Street had predicted would be needed to draw retail interest."
As it was, late trading found the outstanding Treasury long bonds, the 7 7/8 percent issue maturing in February 2021, being offered at 94 29/32, down 1 6/32, while its yield soared to 8.34 percent, from 8.21 percent the day before and 8.22 percent a week ago.
Treasury bond prices plunged even lower in Chicago's futures market. The spot June Treasury bond futures contract plummeted 1.11, to 94 24/32.
In the cash market, the refunding issues auctioned this week will continue to trade on a when-issued basis until the May 15 settlement date, when the buyers at the auctions pay for their securities.
On this basis, the $13.75 billion of the usually popular three-year Treasury notes auctioned Tuesday and carrying a 7 percent coupon traded late in the day at 99 20/32, off 3/32, for a yield of 7.14 percent. The average at the sale was 7.09 percent.
The $11.75 billion of 8 percent 10-year notes that sold on Wednesday at an average yield of 8.07 percent traded at 99 11/32, to yield 8.09 percent.
But the new 8 1/8 percent 30-year bonds bore the brunt of the late selloff, dropping 1 6/32, to 98, while their yield soared to 8.30 percent from the auction average of 8.21 percent.
At the short end of the Treasury maturity spectrum, discount rates on bills were mixed. The 90-day bill rate fell 4 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 5.44 percent; six-month bills were unchanged at 5.62 percent, and the one-year bills added a basis point, at 5.75 percent.
Normally, the Treasury bill market responds to moves by the Federal Reserve. Yesterday, the Fed moved to drain reserves from the banking system. Mr. Leslie said the Fed's move, which was expected, was prompted by what the central bank thought was excessive liquidity in the banking system.
A key measure of this liquidity is the Federal funds rate, which banks charge one another for temporary loans and from which most other interest rates are scaled up. The funds traded at 5 5/8 percent for most of the day, below the Fed's perceived target of 5 3/4 percent, and closed at 5 1/2 percent. As usual late on Friday, demand shriveled.
 
 Liquidity Explanation

Douglas P. Handler, an economist at the Dun & Bradstreet Corporation, offered a possible explanation for the liquidity in the banking system.
"The biggest source of credit is still the credit that merchants receive from suppliers," Mr. Handler said. "The quality of this credit is closely monitored by bankers and other lenders. In any case, we found that at the end of 1990, $64 billion of the credit extended by suppliers, banks and other credit providers to vendors was delinquent, nonperforming or not being serviced promptly."
At the end of the first quarter of this year, Mr. Handler added, "these nonperforming supplier and other credits had increased by 74 percent."

HEADLINE: A Reckoning For Dinkins

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
In proposing the darkest budget New York City has seen since its brush with bankruptcy 16 years ago, Mayor David N. Dinkins said yesterday, "No one is to blame for this crushing burden." But it is weighted by bundles this Mayor chose to carry.
 "To suggest that we are in this fix because of actions of our own is not accurate," Mr. Dinkins said, noting that recession and punishing cuts in state and Federal aid have robbed his city of resources. 
 But the Mayor is also a prisoner of the competing priorities to which he committed himself in one fateful week last fall: granting raises to city workers and hiring thousands of new police officers.
The cost of those moves would amount to almost $800 million for the coming fiscal year, though Mr. Dinkins argues that he has access to some of that money precisely because he did what he did. And if he did not spend at least some of it, workers would get no raises at all and the Police Department would have shrunk by about 2,000 officers next year.
But even half the $800 million could avert the worst of the $2 billion in spending cuts -- from closing health clinics and libraries to suspending recycling -- that he now says he needs to keep the $28.7 billion budget balanced as required by law.
"The chickens of October have come home to roost in May," said Henry Stern, president of the Citizens Union, one of the city's oldest nonprofit civic groups.
Mr. Dinkins refuses to repudiate the labor settlements, but he effectively retreated from them yesterday, calling for more than 20,000 layoffs to pressure most municipal unions to make wage or benefit concessions that could soften the sharpest service cuts.
Paradoxically, the Mayor would end up rewarding one large union that did not support his candidacy -- the police -- because he refuses to waver from his plan to hire thousands of police officers and expand the justice system, which he undertook after blaring headlines about a spate of frightening crimes last summer combined with criticism of his subdued response to force his hand.
 
'We Have Done Something'
 "I know this audience remembers the summer of '90 when the tabloids headlined 'Dave, Do Something' -- people are dying, so do something," Mr. Dinkins told reporters at City Hall. "We have done something and I modestly say done it damn well, and we are going to stick with that the best we can."
Now the question is whether Mr. Dinkins did too much.
It may be the most poignant conundrum of his progressive platform that the city's first black mayor -- who has been asked over and over by both critics and supporters to prove himself -- is now proposing to prove himself by closing the shelters for the homeless and infant mortality programs he fought for, to hire police officers, which are among the most routine of city expenses.
Mr. Dinkins had vowed in his campaign to be "the toughest mayor on crime that this city has ever seen."
But, as one longtime senior adviser said yesterday, "He couldn't get by on rhetoric, like Koch did," referring to Mr. Dinkins's outspoken precedessor, who failed in 12 years to reach the police hiring goal Mr. Dinkins is now pledged to reach in six. "He wasn't seen as true blue."
First Deputy Mayor Norman Steisel said: "The public wanted security. The Mayor fought hard to put this together and he feels its very important to stick with it. There are people who are questioning that now."
To be sure, shelters are of little help if people feel unsafe on the streets, and Mr. Dinkins would use the new officers to support Police Commissioner Lee P. Brown's expansive vision of "community patrol," which emphasizes a return to neighborhood beats and requires a large staff.
The Mayor is also quick to note that the police hiring plan (which also includes programs for youth) is supported by $168 million in special taxes and a new lottery game reserved for that purpose. He won the money after bruising negotiations with the City Council and the State Legislature, and said he might not have won it for less politically popular programs.
But that is only part of the story. Getting the special taxes locks Mr. Dinkins into spending money from the regular budget, too. That is because the legislation approving the new taxes requires Mr. Dinkins to meet fixed police hiring targets by certain dates or lose the new revenues. And he can only meet those goals by going ahead with the level of police hiring that was already planned for the coming year -- replacing 1,700 retirees and adding 1,200 recruits.
That will cost $40 million -- money he must spend to be assured of getting the $168 million.
The true cost of labor settlements already reached and projected also has two parts. Mr. Dinkins says that the direct cost to the city was for a 1.5 percent raise, or about $320 million in the coming year. But the raises were supplemented by raising the assumptions for how much workers' pension funds will earn, which allows the city to reduce its contributions to the funds by about $250 million in the coming year.
The administration needed the unions' support to make the change in pension earnings assumptions, and Mr. Dinkins has repeatedly said he could not have obtained such support without agreeing to use the money for raises. On the other hand, the administration could have chosen to bargain harder, offering to use the pension money to avoid layoffs.
But mayoral aides contend that would not have been acceptable to the unions last fall, when the depth of the city's slide was less clear and the Mayor's decision to pursue both raises and hiring agendas at once made it hard for union leaders to persuade their members that the city was strapped.
For his part, bound by the tight oversight imposed on the city's finances after the fiscal crisis of the mid-1970's, Mr. Dinkins was defensive yesterday.
"It is important to understand that cuts are forced upon us," he said. "If you wish to argue that which cuts to do are mine, I accept that responsibility with every expectation and every hope that it will be recognized that we ought not have to do any of these things."

HEADLINE: U.S. Will Cite Manhattan for Soot Level

BYLINE: By ALLAN R. GOLD

 BODY:
After three years of monitoring bus and truck fumes on Madison Avenue, the Federal Government is preparing to cite New York City for violating health standards for the city's most visible form of pollution: soot.
The finding would give the city -- the diesel-bus capital of the nation -- until Dec. 31, 1997, to reduce soot levels in Manhattan. City and state officials said they would try to meet the standards through a variety of measures, including buying buses that burn cleaner fuels. 
 Another approach would be expanding the use of soot traps on diesel buses. And state officials say the city could also consider restrictions on truck access to mid-Manhattan, although attempts to impose traffic restrictions to comply with Federal health standards for ozone and carbon monoxide -- both of which the city has already been found to violate -- have failed repeatedly. If compliance is not reached, the Government could impose sanctions, such as cutting off Federal highway grants, although such measures are rarely invoked.
 
Madison Ave. at 47th St.
 The soot problem in mid-Manhattan is attributed mainly to emissions from diesel engines on trucks and buses. Toxic particles in the black smoke become trapped between tall buildings lining the streets, causing or aggravating respiratory problems. The Federal Government has identified the particles as a probable cause of cancer.
Air quality monitoring on Madison Avenue at 47th Street, which is one of the busiest bus thoroughfares in Manhattan, has shown annual violations since 1988, environmental officials say.
"While everyone on the street knows the diesel buses and trucks smell bad, this is the first formal Government step to acknowledge this public health problem," said Eric A. Goldstein, a senior lawyer with the Natural Resources Defense Council, a nonprofit environmental group.
Government officials say they will formally designate Manhattan as a violator in July.
State and city environmental officials acknowledge that Federal standards are violated in Manhattan but say that the standards can be attained by the 1997 deadline. "We're not that far out of attainment," said Thomas C. Jorling, the state's Environmental Conservation Commissioner.
The soot levels measured exceeded the standards by 14 percent in 1988, by 32 percent in 1989 and by 10 percent in 1990, according to figures from the Environmental Protection Agency.
The cost of a soot control program is uncertain. But it will be closely related to the price tag for gradually converting the city's bus fleet to fuels that burn more cleanly, said Albert F. Appleton, the city's Environmental Protection Commissioner.
Both Mr. Jorling and Mr. Appleton said the compliance plan would include wider use of buses powered by cleaner-burning fuels like natural gas and methanol. Mr. Jorling also said the plan could require better inspection and maintenance for diesel vehicles, stricter enforcement of vehicle-idling regulations and limits on the hours that trucks may use city streets.
 
Soot Traps on Buses
 One corrective step taken by the Transit Authority involves equipping new buses with pollution-control devices that trap 85 percent of soot particles before they are emitted. But questions have been raised by public and private environmental experts about whether these devices are durable enough to offer a long-term solution to soot and other air pollution problems.
The Transit Authority has responded that it is monitoring developments in alternative-fuels technology but that the emissions traps are the best and most economical technology available for controlling soot.
The Transit Authority operates 3,600 diesel buses while private companies run several thousand more. In addition, 10,000 diesel trucks are registered in the city, and thousands more enter and leave each day.
Diesel engines have been popular because they are more durable than those powered by gasoline, fuel is cheaper and, until recently emissions standards were less stringent. But they are far dirtier, emitting 30 to 70 times as many particles as gasoline engines, the Environmental Protection Agency said.
Soot violations in Manhattan have been recorded only recently because the Federal Government began using a new standard in 1987 that addresses smaller particles. These particles -- less than 10 microns, or one-tenth the width of a human hair -- have been found most likely to produce health problems because they can pass through the body's natural filters in the nose and mouth and lodge in the lungs.
 
Emissions Standards
 Even if the Government did not force new soot control measures, New York City air would probably have still become cleaner through recently passed national and city pollution legislation.
The Federal Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 calls for much stricter emissions standards on new diesel bus engines beginning in the 1993 model year and another tightening the following year. And Mayor David N. Dinkins signed legislation last January requiring the city to begin purchasing vehicles, including buses, using fuels that burn more cleanly than gasoline.
For now, the Transit Authority has purchased 400 buses, more than 10 percent of the fleet, equipped with the special soot emissions control devices, called trap oxidizers. A Transit Authority maintenance official, John Walsh, said the devices would permit new city buses to comply with the strictest Federal soot emissions standards.

HEADLINE: U.P.S. Is Latest to See Prices Diminish the Lure of Suburbs

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GREENWICH, Conn., May 10

 BODY:
When the United Parcel Service moved its corporate headquarters here in 1975, it was part of an exodus of companies fleeing the high costs of living and working in New York City.
This week, United Parcel Service officials announced that they were moving again, this time to Atlanta. But it was for much the same reason. The company said the chief reason it planned to move 1,000 employees was that the cost of suburban housing that offered a welcome refuge two decades ago had risen so much. 
 "We are right back to facing what we wanted to escape from when we left the city," said the company's chairman, Kent C. Nelson, noting that housing costs in Fairfield County are double those in Atlanta.
The median price of a home in the Atlanta area in the first three months of this year, according to the National Association of Realtors, was $86,000. The median price of a single-family home in southwestern Connecticut was $165,100 and the median price of homes sold in Greenwich during the last year is $480,000, according to the Greenwich Board of Realtors.
Housing prices like those, Mr. Nelson said, force many employees transferred here to lower their standards of living by buying smaller homes than the ones they had given up, or by commuting an hour or more from Danbury, Trumbull and other towns on the outer rim of the metropolitan area.
"The sentiment is that most of the employees are looking forward to it," said Robert Kenney, a spokesman for the company. "The cost of living here is extremely high."
"I'm real positive about it," said Leroy W. Daniel, a computer technician who lives in Yonkers and has been with the company for six years. "Overall, the feelings are mixed. A lot of the younger people without any ties to the area think it's a great opportunity. Some of the others who have ties to the area aren't so sure."
The move comes as the appeal of lower Fairfield County, which is home to more than two dozen Fortune 500 companies, is changing.
The area is still attractive to small-to-medium-sized companies and larger ones with ties to Manhattan. For example, the Morgan Stanley Group, a securities firm with 4,200 employees, has been negotiating for months to move from midtown Manhattan to downtown Stamford. And on Friday, the Macmillan publishing house announced plans to move its headquarters from Third Avenue and 52d Street to downtown Greenwich.
 
Other Companies Slip Out
 But for companies that moved here in the 1970's and 1980's, growing traffic congestion and some of the most expensive housing in the nation have tarnished the county's luster. GTE, for example, has been paring down its presence in Stamford for years, moving employees to Plano, Tex. And at least 10 large corporations, including Conoco, Kennecott, the Continental Group and the Singer Company, have moved their headquarters out of the area or sharply cut their operations because of mergers and takeovers.
In March, the office vacancy rate for Fairfield County was among the highest in the nation: 26.9 percent, largely a result of overbuilding in the 1980's.
"It is always a reason to be glum when a company leaves the area, especially one the size of U.P.S.," said Joseph M. Ercolano, vice president for economic development for the Southwestern Area Commerce and Industry Association, a Stamford-based business-advocacy group.
But the company's departure, which could add hundreds more homes to brokers' "For Sale" listings, is not expected to seriously hurt the glutted Greenwich housing market because only "a handful" of United Parcel Service employees can afford to live in Greenwich, Mr. Kenney said.
Bett McCarthy, executive vice president of the Greenwich Board of Realtors, suggested that it would have a greater impact elsewhere in Fairfield County and in Westchester.
 
Impact May Be Diluted
 But Ormond G. Farris, the head broker at the Century 21 A&B Realty office in Stamford, said the impact even on the region's severely glutted market would be diluted by the wide area in which U.P.S. employees live. He said there are already 1,400 homes and condominiums on the market in Stamford alone. "The homes of U.P.S. people are scattered around," he said. "It is not like there are 500 homes going on the market in Stamford. That would be a disaster."
The loss of the company is more likely to be felt by Greenwich charities. U.P.S. is the city's largest donor and has given as much as $3 million a year to them, including the United Way and the Greenwich Hospital. "They are wonderful corporate citizens, and Greenwich will dearly miss them," Ms. McCarthy said.
The company has not yet picked a site in Atlanta for its headquarters, Mr. Nelson said.
But it must move, Mr. Nelson said, because it is becoming difficult to keep administrators, especially if they were being transferred from the Midwest or South, despite salary differentials and perquisites paid by the company to resettled employees. Worldwide, United Parcel Service employs 245,000 people. It was in New York for 45 years before moving to Greenwich in 1975.
"I was just in Louisville and people there told me they were dreading facing buying a home in Connecticut if they were fortunate enough to be promoted," Mr. Nelson said.
He said other factors, like airports, cultural amenities, similarity of landscape and lifestyle also influenced the decision. But the growing tax burden in Connecticut and the increasing clamor for a state income tax was not a factor. Georgia has a state income tax.
Mr. Nelson said that Dallas, Baltimore and Cincinnati were the runner-ups. Florida, he said, was ruled out because its resort image is not appropriate for the company.
The company, which is owned by its employees, plans to begin moving workers to the Atlanta this fall.

HEADLINE: DINKINS PRESENTS '92 BUDGET, VOWING TO BAR TAKEOVER

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
A somber and sometimes angry Mayor David N. Dinkins presented a worst-case New York City budget yesterday filled with sharp tax increases, searing service cuts and more than 20,000 layoffs and declared that he was committed to carrying it all out if necessary to stave off a takeover of city finances by a state oversight agency.
"The nearly eight million people who are privileged to call this great city home must decide whether we shall make our own destiny or have another destiny forced upon us," Mr. Dinkins said at a City Hall news conference. 
 With charts mounted on an easel by his side, he laid out the specter of $1 billion in tax increases and cuts ranging from the shutdown of all municipal swimming pools to the elimination of infant-mortality-prevention programs to close a $3.5 billion budget gap for the fiscal year that begins on July 1.
 
Council Opposition Likely
 The budget presented by Mr. Dinkins, which faces a potential fight in the City Council, would be 2.6 percent larger than this year's, bringing it to $28.7 billion, the smallest increase in years. It is far below the 7 percent growth projected between last year's budget and the current one, even after months of budget-cutting and alarms about a possible deficit.
Property taxes would rise by $776 million next year and by more than $500 million a year in each of the next three years, increases that have sparked a protest movement in the real-estate field. Taxes on a house with a market value of $170,000 would go up by $227 next year, to $1,570.
Personal income tax increases would rise by another $200 million, with the maximum rate going to 4.3 percent from 3.9, costing a family with $100,000 income $260 more next year. A family with a $50,000 income would pay $76 more.
 
New Tax on Autos
 A new 1 percent tax on the value of automobiles would raise $45 million and expanding the sales tax to cover cable television, airline food and the trade-in value of automobiles would raise $45 million.
City officials attributed virtually the entire growth in the budget to an $800 million increase in debt service, mainly a result of bond refinancings and other fiscal sleights of hand that had temporarily cut those costs in the current budget.
Other spending on city services would remain nearly constant, with the cost of an ambitious expansion of the police force, wage increases for city workers and higher welfare costs offset by layoffs and spending cuts, including a 42 percent cut in staffing at the Parks Department.
Some cuts were less heralded. The Board of Education, which avoided a large cut this year, was hit with far deeper cuts next year. Because it is an independent agency, the details of the cuts would be decided by the board.
But with the hiring of police and correction officers continuing next year, the total number of city employees would decline by only 8,357 from the 241,794 on the payroll when Mr. Dinkins took office on Jan. 1, 1990, a roll-back that would reduce the payroll only to the levels of three years ago.
 
Looking for Concessions
 Yesterday Mr. Dinkins, seeking to dampen concern, said the city had successfully closed a $465 million gap calculated under its accounting system for the current fiscal year and would also have enough cash on hand to pay its bills. But he warned that if the State Legislature failed to adopt a long-delayed state budget by May 25, the city could have difficulty selling $600 million in bonds, which in turn could create an immediate cash problem.
After months of concern and complaints that the Mayor had not cut spending enough and with growing urgency over the city's balancing its budget, Mr. Dinkins put out his dire plan with the hope of wresting concessions from union leaders, state aid from Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, and surplus cash and the proceeds of bond refinancings from a state agency, the Municipal Assistance Corporation.
But yesterday Mr. Dinkins angrily insisted that the need for deep cuts was real and that the cuts would begin immediately as part of his commitment to do whatever was necessary to maintain control of the city's finances. A memo to city commissioners ordered them to identify workers to be laid off within a week so that they could be off the payroll by the end of the fiscal year.
Asked if some of the service cuts were merely a ploy, Mr. Dinkins, a touch of anger in his voice, said: "The process begins now. Now is upon us, and those who think this is some kind of exercise are mistaken."
 
Blaming Washington
 Later when a reporter suggested that the Mayor's own policies might be to blame in part for the city's current problems, Mr. Dinkins strenously disagreed and turned a finger of blame to cuts in Federal aid to cities.
"To suggest that we are in this fix because of actions of our own is not accurate," Mr. Dinkins said.
And even as Mr. Dinkins announced his plan, the City Council, which has the power to modify and approve the budget, dissented. The Speaker of the Council, Peter F. Vallone, promised to keep the Central Park Zoo open and street lights on while he reviewed the social service budget.
At a news conference, Mr. Vallone and other council leaders, said Mr. Dinkins's proposed tax increases went too far. They called for deeper, structural changes, rather than across-the-board cuts.
Others offered little praise for the Mayor. Advocates for services urged him to roll back cuts, while others pressed for deeper reforms in the way the city does business.
State Comptroller Edward V. Regan called the plan to close the zoo "only a pressure tactic to get tax increases and concessions" reflecting a failure of the city government to "undertake fundamental reforms."
 
Labor Asks Burden-Sharing
 To head off the worst of the cuts, Mr. Dinkins is seeking hundreds of millions of dollars in help from city unions, the State Legislature and the Municipal Assistance Corporation, and he plans to go to Washington next week as part of a delegation of city officials pressing the Federal Government to step in to help cities battered by the recession.
Yesterday union leaders said they would help, but only if others do their fair share.
Felix Rohaytn, the chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, which was set up in the 1970's to sell bonds on the city's behalf, said his staff was working on a plan to help the city, but he said it would not be easy. He is to report on his progress late next week.
With city revenues sagging because of the recession, and the size of the city work force still above the near-record levels when Mr. Dinkins took office, concern has been mounting that the State Financial Control Board, an agency set up in 1975 during the last fiscal crisis, could assume powers now in reserve to regulate city spending.
Some business and civic leaders have urged the Mayor to invite the Financial Control Board to assume its regulatory powers, as a way to staunch concern in the financial markets, and to help the city drastically curtail services in a single year.
But Mr. Dinkins, leaning on some oratory more in tune with a civil rights rally than a city budget, insisted that the city must prevail on its own, so "our generation and the next will be able to hold our heads high as free men and free women in a free city."
"I advance these proposals with a heavy heart," he said. "If we lose control of our finances, we lose control of our government -- and that is something we cannot and will not allow."

HEADLINE: Woodbridge Schools Pay for Voter Support

BYLINE: By ROBERT HANLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WOODBRIDGE, N.J., May 9

 BODY:
As scores of communities in northern New Jersey rejected school budgets last week, residents of this sprawling suburb of 93,000 people voted their approval of a budget for the first time in 27 years.
The deeply divided school board had virtually insured the passage of the $103 million budget by first cutting $4.5 million from it, which guaranteed that no new taxes would be needed. 
 Now Woodbridge's Superintendent, Fredric Buonocore, and his staff are grappling with a retrenchment that colleagues elsewhere might consider unthinkable. With enrollment down almost 50 percent from its peak in the baby-boom years, this school system is shrinking in many ways.
Officials have dismissed 79 teachers and administrators and 20 aides out of a staff of 1,600; eliminated 140 courses in Woodbridge's three high schools; increased class sizes; dropped classes in computers, music, driver training and other subjects and ordered delays in repairs at some of the 24 schools.
 
Teachers Feel Betrayed
 Bitterness prevails. Teachers feel betrayed by the three educators on the board who, with two other members, ordered the budget cut. Leaders of parents groups complain that the pro-cut majority is more sensitive to elderly taxpayers than to students, and they helped defeat the only majority member up for re-election last week.
An angry Dr. Buonocore said Gov. Jim Florio and the State Legislature had turned their backs on schools by taking $380 million from the $1.1 billion in increased school aid that Mr. Florio initially wanted and giving it to towns to cut property taxes.
"It's a sick situation," Dr. Buonocore said. "We need more support for education and less is coming."
Authors of the $4.5 million cut disagree, saying Woodbridge's school administrators have spent too much for years. "They waste money," said Warren Larsen, the board member who lost his seat in the voter backlash. "If they were concerned about what's good for children, why don't they work longer hours?
"We're going to make people in the schools work harder and earn their money. That was the message we sent out."
Joseph Karabin, head of the board's finance committee, said, "We felt there were quite a few areas that could be managed more effectively." Before he became a board member two years ago, he ran the science department at Colonia High School for 21 years.
Enrollment has dropped from 21,000 in 1967 to about 11,000 today, Mr. Karabin said. Dozens of classes in the three high schools and five middle schools have fewer than 10 students.
"That's a very sparse number and a very big cost factor," he said.
 
Variety Will Be Lost
 In response, Dr. Buonocore said Woodbridge's hallmark had been a rich variety of courses. "One of the things we prided ourselves on was the many, many offerings to provide for the individual needs of students," he said. "The long-term effect will be that some youngsters will never have the opportunities to experience some of them."
The biggest single budget cut -- $1.5 million -- led to the dismissal of 70 teachers and the elimination of high school courses with fewer than 10 students, officials said. Chinese I and German I were dropped at one school or another, as were current affairs, computer science, architectural drawing, advanced placement physics, carpentry and basic stenography. At one high school, business systems I and II will be merged; in another, French II and III will be.
Separate sociology and economics classes for average and above average students will be merged. Computer instruction will be reduced. Cello and violin instruction will be eliminated in elementary schools. Special arts, music and drama for gifted students in all grades will be scrapped, as will driver training.
 
Bus Routes, Overtime
 Other cuts include $800,000 for 63 of the 275 bus routes in this 23-square mile community; $500,000 for supervisors' salaries; $600,000 in staff health-care benefits, $300,000 in capital programs, including roof repair and playground repaving; $200,000 in overtime, primarily spent for janitors during nighttime use of schools by community groups, and $100,000 for new equipment, Dr. Buonocore said.
In less cost-conscious times, Woodbridge's budget usually increased at least 10 percent a year. Although budgets were defeated 27 times in a row, the votes are nonbinding and mean only that the budget is submitted to the town government, which can order cuts.
This year, state legislators, fretting about taxpayer hostility to last year's $2.8 billion increase in state income and sales taxes, imposed maximum spending increases for all districts. Woodbridge's cap was 7.65 percent.
The proposed 1991-1992 budget met that level. But Mr. Karabin of the finance committee said it required a property tax increase of $364 on a home assessed at $140,000 -- roughly the average assessment in Woodbridge, he said.
To avoid raising taxes, Mr. Karabin and four allies tapped a $4 million surplus from earlier years and cut $4.5 million from the $81 million part of the budget to be raised from property taxes. Toyce Collins, head of Woodbridge's teachers union, said the cut turned a "frugal budget into an irresponsibly low budget."
The union and parent groups failed to persuade the board to restore $2.3 million, but then campaigned intensely for passage, fearing a defeat would lead to even deeper cuts by the Council.
On voting day, a parents' get-out-the-vote campaign prevailed. About 10 percent of the eligible voters voted, and the budget passed 2,281 to 2,103. Among elderly voters, the turnout was sparse, apparently because the flat tax rate for 1991-92 mollified their traditional opposition to school budgets.

HEADLINE: Drug Makers Face Pressure To Restrain Price Increases

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
A new Federal law requiring drug makers to cut their prices to Medicaid programs has touched off efforts by virtually every other major purchaser to control the costs of prescription drugs.
Taken together, these efforts represent the most serious challenge yet to the ability of drug makers to continue raising prices far more rapidly than the general rate of inflation. Prescription drugs have been one of the fastest-growing but least regulated health-care costs. 
 Under a law passed in December, the Federal Government has ordered drug makers to pay an estimated $3.3 billion in rebates over five years on products provided to the poor by Medicaid. State programs that spend hundreds of millions of dollars on drugs for the elderly are now pressing for similar rebates.
Employers and private insurers are trying to keep the drug companies from shifting the costs of the Medicaid rebates to them. In addition, a growing number of insurers, health maintenance organizations and other cost-containment plans are strengthening incentives for patients to use lower-priced, alternative drugs.
More large purchasers are demanding discounts and rebates. And some public officials are seeking price controls like those in most other industrial countries.
For the time being, the drug companies seem capable of fending off most constraints because most doctors who prescribe drugs still do not worry much about the costs. Even those companies that hold the line on prices of older drugs can increase their profits by introducing new, more expensive medicines.
Pharmaceutical executives say privately that they have never felt such strong pressure to limit their prices. Some fear they will become as closely regulated as public utilities.
The drug companies say that Government price controls would damage the economy by harming one of the nation's strongest industries. Regulation would discourage spending on scientific advances that can save lives, they say.
The new law requires the companies to offer rebates to Medicaid programs matching their deepest discounts -- sometimes as much as 60 percent -- for other large purchasers. Some drug companies have responded by eliminating these discounts and sharply increasing their charges to hospitals, health maintenance organizations and even other Government agencies.
Angered by the increases, David Pryor, chairman of the Senate Aging Committee and the principal author of the Medicaid rebate law, has suggested sharply curtailing the drug industry's benefits from various Government programs.
But the drug makers said they had to raise prices and reduce discounts to make up for lost earnings. The Medicaid rebate law "threw a monkey wrench into the marketplace," said Dr. Charles A. Sanders, chief executive of the American unit of Glaxo Holdings P.L.C. of Britain, one of the largest drug makers. "People are scrambling around trying to figure out what to do."
 
Hospitals Could Be Hurt
 Glaxo is considering whether to abolish all its drug discounts, as several major companies have already done. Hospitals and other large purchasers say that without the discounts, their drug expenses will rise at least $1 billion this year, or more than 12 percent.
Americans spent $34.2 billion for prescription drugs last year, with $15.1 billion, or 44 percent, paid directly by individuals. People older than 65 bought at least one-third of all prescriptions, with only those used in hospitals covered by Medicare, the Federal health program for the elderly.
Although drugs consume only 6 percent to 8 percent of the nation's health-care spending, prices have been rising much faster than general inflation. New drugs can be painfully expensive. Some medicines for high blood pressure or ulcers require decades of use.
Spending for prescriptions for employees and retirees has been increasing by more than 20 percent a year at many companies. Employers and private insurers paid about $12 billion for prescription drugs last year, up from $5 billion in 1980, said Stephen W. Schondelmeyer, director of Purdue University's Pharmaceutical Economics Research Center.
New accounting rules are forcing large companies to deduct from profits the estimated future costs of health benefits for retirees, which may amount to several hundred million dollars. The Aluminum Company of America says it expects drugs to absorb about 28 percent of its $1 billion in estimated retirees' costs.
Ronald Nordmann, an analyst at Paine Webber Inc., said the pharmaceutical industry's greatest fear was that the Medicaid rebate law presaged more Government intervention. Pennsylvania, which uses $220 million a year of state lottery money to provide drugs for the elderly, is already pressing for rebates on these purchases. "Government is saying, 'Hello, we are the market and we are not going to bear this anymore,' " said Linda M. Rhodes, Pennsylvania's Secretary of Aging. Eleven other states have similar drug programs for the elderly.
Senator Pryor, an Arkansas Democrat, has asked Dr. Louis M. Sullivan, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, to review hundreds of millions of dollars in tax credits that the drug companies receive for research and development and at least $1.4 billion in tax credits for operating factories in Puerto Rico.
"I think some of the companies are taking this research and development money and using it for the marketing of me-too drugs," Senator Pryor said.
 
Marketing Costs Noted
 Mr. Pryor also asked Dr. Sullivan to see whether the drug companies were claiming research tax credits for marketing activities. David Wilson, a principal with the Foster Higgins consulting firm, said the industry spends $2.5 billion annually on marketing, or $5,000 for every American physician.
The drug companies deny all of Senator Pryor's accusations, saying that patients benefit from their tax-subsidized research. Administration officials warn that unless drug companies limit price increases voluntarily, they will face more calls from Congress for further cost controls. "Pharmaceuticals is a successful, internationally competitive industry and we want to make sure it stays that way," said Gail R. Wilensky, the Federal Medicare and Medicaid administrator. "There are some individuals who would just as soon see the industry as a regulated public utility. I would hate to see the companies doing anything that would give those groups any encouragement."
American employers and insurers are also demanding better prices. To control medical costs, they are forming health maintenance organizations and other groups that limit patients to certain doctors and hospitals. The groups can then bargain with drug makers and steer patients to products that cost less.
Many health plans are refusing to pay the full cost of a drug when a cheaper alternative is available. Some health plans that will pay the $690 typical annual cost of treating ulcers with SmithKline Beecham's Tagamet require patients to pay all or part of the $910 annual cost of Glaxo's Zantac, a newer remedy.
The companies say their high profit margins -- about triple those of most other large American companies last year -- allowed them to spend $8.2 billion for research and development. But economists at the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment said recently that industry estimates of research costs depend on "arbitrary" numbers that cannot be substantiated.
 
Increases Expected to Continue
 Most analysts say the drug industry will succeed in resisting cost containment pressures for at least the next few years. "In the short run, the vast majority will continue price increases as a way to rachet up growth," said Marsha Fanucci, a consultant with Arthur D. Little.
Merck & Company, the world's largest drug maker, says it will keep its price increases below the general rate of inflation. But analysts said that Merck and other companies reaped some of their largest profits from setting high prices on new drugs that replaced less expensive ones.
Companies like Merck that have many important new products can shrug off demands for discounts, said Paul A. Brooke, an analyst at Morgan Stanley. But companies with weak research and products that already face strong competition could face hard times, he said.
Federal officials and health care administrators say that for all but Medicaid patients, this year is bringing another pile of higher drug bills. Congressional aides said that veterans hospitals face $150 million in higher drug expenses, up 21 percent. Kaiser Permanente, the country's largest health maintenance organization, said its drug costs would rise by $140 million, or 31 percent.
Many drug companies are eliminating discounts, which they would now be required to share with the Medicaid program. Jeffrey Bourret, the pharmacy director at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, cited the Du Pont Merck Pharmaceutical Company, a joint venture, which raised the price of Coumadin, an anticoagulent, from $1.80 for 100 tablets to $37.26. But Roger R. Morris, a joint venture spokesman, said the increase reflected a decision made before the Medicaid law's passage.
Mr. Morris and spokesmen for several other companies said they would continue to offer drug discounts to Federal depots that supply veterans and military hospitals. The law does not require the drug companies to give the Medicaid program the same discounts as the depots receive. The hospitals have found it easier to fill their needs by ordering directly, but many drug producers no longer offer them discounts.
As long as almost half of the nation's drugs are purchased by individuals, analysts say, the drug makers can continue raising their prices. "In our system," said Marc O. Mayer, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, "one person prescribes a drug, another person dispenses it, somebody else takes it and somebody else pays for it."

HEADLINE: Black Frats Step Back

BYLINE: By Bill Maxwell; Bill Maxwell is a columnist for The Gainesville Sun.

DATELINE: GAINESVILLE , Fla.

 BODY:
While verbal and physical attacks against African American students are at an all-time high nationwide, and while battlelines are being drawn over admissions quotas and culturally diverse curriculas, many black students are their own worst enemies.
At the University of Florida, for example, two black fraternities, Kappa Alpha Psi and Phi Beta Sigma, are at each other's throats, not over how to improve exam scores or how best to get more black jocks to earn degrees. No, we're talking about potential fratricide, so to speak, over such weighty issues as which fraternity wears the fanciest outfits or has the most intricate dance steps. 
 Between April 20 and 22, the Kappas and Sigmas hurled profanities, kicked in doors, fought with fists and canes and exchanged gunshots at an off-campus apartment complex. Luckily, no one was killed. The university has suspended both fraternities indefinitely and the police are seeking charges against those who used handguns during the incident.
I'm sad that these violent incidents occurred because black Greek-letter organizations began with noble goals. The 65,000-member Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity, for example, established in 1914, promoted brotherhood, community service and academic excellence through scholarships and tutorial programs. Kappa Alpha Psi was founded in 1911 at the predominantly white Indiana University to encourage black achievement and mutual support; it also runs housing and job placement services.
But these organizations, like others that have forgotten their original purposes, undercut their effectiveness through pettiness, false superiority, unproductive competition, egotism, childish pranks and now open warfare. These faults are not local nor are they recent developments.
When I attended Wiley College in Marshall, Tex., during the early 1960's, I became a pledge to Omega Psi Phi. The silly and sometimes dangerous hazing notwithstanding, I was appalled at the negative remarks made about members of other fraternities -- blacks like me who were struggling to get a college education.
My big brothers tried to make me dislike, if not hate, blacks who belonged to other fraternities. Disgusted, I quit the pledge line.
There's more. I couldn't join one fraternity even if I wanted to. Why? Because my skin is too black. This fraternity was for those with fair skin, curly or straight hair and so-called good breeding; the same was true of some sororities. Even today, several black Greek organizations select their members along skin-color lines.
Such behavior isn't innocuous. After these people graduate, many members select their friends, business partners, churches and even spouses in this shallow manner. I know several who force houseguests to wear society colors. The most bizarre practice is that of fraternity members who brand their group's symbol on their arms.
Sure, I've heard the arguments ad nauseam: These groups need their identity. They need their pride. True enough, but for blacks -- as a group that is generally mired in economic, social and political problems -- such behavior is self-destructive.
Recently, for example, a promising central Florida black chamber of commerce dissolved because its members aligned themselves according to Greek organizations. "The frat I belong to wanted to control all of the executive positions," a chamber member said. "The other frats wouldn't cooperate, so the chamber just fell apart. Black frats need to learn to work together."
Indeed. Imagine the chamber's accomplishments had it been unified; imagine the clout a unified voice could have developed with civic, political and lending institutions.
The Kappas and Sigmas have written letters of apology to their local chapters and national offices, and to university officials. But that's not enough. For the good of all African Americans, black fraternities and sororities should revive their original objectives. After all, their members are at the university to learn, not to play children's games.

HEADLINE: Fishing Rights for the Few Is Un-American

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Without fanfare, Washington has begun to turn over to private interests the exclusive rights to the multibillion-dollar harvest of fish off the United States coast" (front page, April 22). 
 I think that turning over the right to fish commercially to a select group is counter to the American spirit of free enterprise. This system of individual transferable catch quotas is the latest experiment in fisheries management, the result of at least 30 years of mismanagement of the fish stocks that live in Federal waters by the National Marine Fisheries Service.
Here is a case where the Federal Government is going to bestow an economic windfall on relatively few people and eliminate the majority's chance to make a living from the sea. This policy is an attempt to end a citizen's right to own and operate a small fishing boat business for the capture and sale of fish.
Can you imagine the government trying to allocate the number of restaurants or supermarkets based on economic efficiency? Who would dare to say that there are too many establishments and that we must set the number that makes every participant a profit regardless of quality? Where is the free market capitalistic spirit that allows us to choose what we want to do?
Fish stocks would be more abundant if Federal laws did not allow fishermen to kill and discard millions of pounds of juvenile fish, just to catch the relatively few adults. Both the Marine Fisheries Service and the so-called Fishery Management Councils -- the eight regional groups dominated by local fishing interests that are being allowed to hand out exclusive rights to the catch -- are trying to avoid the political fallout of mismanagement from influential boat owners by giving them the soon-to-be-limited right to fish.
What about the captains and crews who work the ocean in the hope of making enough money so that they can own their own boats and businesses? What has the Federal Government really done to improve the economic efficiency of fishing?
This policy creates more problems than it attempts to eliminate. The reduction in the number of fishing boats will result in a significant loss of revenue and jobs in the transportation, shipbuilding, marine electronic, fuel, repair and other marine-related industries. There will be problems in the transfer of fishing effort from Federal waters to state waters.
If this Federal policy continues, then the next logical step is for the Federal Government to sell the exclusive rights away from the millions of recreational fishermen to the few wealthy boat owners.
The best idea for the Federal Government is to develop fishery management plans that would facilitate the rebuilding of fish stocks and eliminate bi-catch kills and waste, and that allow the free market system to work.

HEADLINE: Bela A. Balassa, 63, Economics Professor Who Fled Hungary

BYLINE: By ALFONSO A. NARVAEZ

 BODY:
Bela A. Balassa, an economist and a retired professor of political economy at Johns Hopkins University who specialized in trade and development, died yesterday at his home in Washington. He was 63 years old.
He died of complications of throat cancer, said his wife, the former Carol Levy. 
 Dr. Balassa was born in Hungary and educated at the University of Budapest, where he earned a law degree. He taught economics and statistics in Hungary before emigrating to the United States in 1957 after taking part in the anti-Communist revolt.
He was named a Rockefeller Foundation fellow in 1957 and went on to earn a Ph.D. at Yale University. After graduation, he served as an assistant professor at Yale until 1966 and also taught at the University of California at Berkeley and at Columbia University. In 1967 he joined the faculty of Johns Hopkins and was a professor there at his retirement on May 1.
He was a consultant to the World Bank and to public and private international organizations and the author of more than 23 books on trade and development, including "The Hungarian Experience in Economic Planning," "Trade Prospects for Developing Countries," "Toward Renewed Economic Growth in Latin America" and "Adjusting to Success: Balance of Payments Policy in East Asia."
His awards included the Bernhard Harms prize from the Kiel Institute of World Economies in 1984. He was also awarded honorary doctoral degrees from the University of Paris in 1990 and from the University of Budapest in 1991. He was recently elected a fellow of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.
In addition to his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Mara Balassa of Washington; a son, Gabor, also of Washington; and two sisters, Judith Nagy of San Rafael, Calif., and Charlotte Garvey of Mountain View, Calif.

HEADLINE: C. McKim Norton, 84, Ex-Leader Of Regional Plan Group, Is Dead

BYLINE: By ERIC PACE

 BODY:
C. McKim Norton, former president of the Regional Plan Association, a private nonprofit group working for the development and conservation of the New York metropolitan region, died early yesterday at the Brookhaven Nursing Center in Lexington, Mass. He was 84 years old.
 He died of leukemia, his family said. He was a resident of North Haven, Me., and lived in Princeton, N.J., from 1950 to 1989. 
The association, based in Manhattan, devises long-range public policies on economic development, transportation, land use and other issues. It then recommends the policies to leaders in the public and private sectors in New York, Connecticut and New Jersey.
 Mr. Norton headed the association's staff from 1940 to 1943 and from 1945 until his retirement in 1969.
 
Helped Develop Parks
 Sigurd Grava, professor of urban planning at Columbia University, said Mr. Norton made a "major contribution in assisting the development of parks" in the region.
 Professor Grava, who heads Columbia's urban planning program, said Mr. Norton had been instrumental in bringing about the creation of the Gateway National Recreation Area. The 26,000-acre patchwork of sites in Queens, Staten Island, Brooklyn and New Jersey was established by Congress in 1972 with the intention that it become the first urban national park in the United States. Critics say it has suffered from skimpy Federal support over the years.
 On parks and other questions, Mr. Norton was something of a gadfly. In 1960 he warned, "The New York metropolitan region is falling behind in its response to mounting pressures for more recreational space."
 Admirers of Mr. Norton in the planning world have said that he was ahead of his time in prompting debate on problems in such basic spheres as garbage disposal and sewers.
 
Advocate of Mass Transit
 Under his direction, the association led a campaign to revitalize the region's deteriorating public transportation system. The association's current president, Richard T. Anderson, said the campaign played a substantial role in the creation of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority in 1968.
 With Mr. Norton in charge, the association also worked out a comprehensive regional plan and issued it in the 1960's. It was a package of many detailed recommendations that emphasized the importance of rebuilding older cities and of encouraging satellite commercial and business centers.
 Though the plan had no legal force, Professor Grava said it was influential in focusing attention on those and other questions.
 
Father Was a Planner
 Charles McKim Norton was born Jan. 6, 1907, in Lake Forest, Ill., the son of Charles Dyer Norton and the former Katherine McKim Garrison. The elder Mr. Norton played an important role in drawing up an earlier regional plan for the New York City area.
 The younger Mr. Norton graduated from the Groton School, Harvard College, in 1929, and Harvard Law School. He worked as a lawyer and banker in New York and as a lawyer for the National Resources Planning Board in Washington before joining the association, which he left for Army service in World War II.
 Over the years he was also a member of the National Capital Planning Commission in Washington, vice president of the American Institute of Planners, vice president of the Middlesex-Somerset-Mercer Regional Study Council in New Jersey and chairman of the Borough Planning Board in Princeton.
 He was awarded the gold medal of the American Society of Planning Officials and the Distinguished Service Award of the American Institute of Planners.
 Mr. Norton was married in 1939 to Martha Chipman Hutcheson, a pianist. She died in 1988.
 He is survived by a daughter, Lucia Norton Woodruff of Austin, Tex., a violinist with the Austin Symphony Orchestra; a son, John C. Norton of Watertown, Mass., an art teacher and painter; a brother, Garrison Norton of Washington; a sister, Lucia Norton Valentine of Mercer County, N.J.; and four grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Heavy-Metal Mania: It's More Than Music

BYLINE: By DEANNE STILLMAN; Deanne Stillman frequently writes about American culture. Her work has appeared in The Los Angeles Times, The Village Voice and California magazine. She also writes for television.

 BODY:
"I'm in my mid-30's, I'm a professional, I pay my taxes, I'm a voter, I love heavy metal, and I will until I die." So says Tawn Mastrey, host of the video-magazine Metal Head. Ms. Mastrey built her reputation as "the leather nun" at KNAC, the Los Angeles heavy-metal radio station that features a traffic reporter named Headbangin' Barb, car insurance ads for "dudes" with questionable driving records and a turbo-charged playlist that "will make your ears bleed."
The only thing louder than heavy-metal music are heavy-metal fans. But there are many who choose not to hear this very noisy group, who regard the world of metal as being unrefined beyond redemption. 
 To get air time at the national cocktail party, three hard-core, precision metal bands -- Anthrax, Megadeth and Slayer -- embark on a two-month carpet-bombing beginning Thursday in Dallas (the tour reaches New York on June 28). As the press release for the "Clash of the Titans" tour puts it: "How do three bands with no Top-40 or album-rock airplay and scant video play launch a tour of the same arenas as Billy Joel and U2? Answer: Fans."
Says the Anthrax guitarist Scott Ian: "This tour is a salute to those fans so they can stand up and be counted. It's like we're saying, 'Here we are. Now deal with us.' "
"Us" encompasses a cultural phenomenon that continues to give everyone from fundamentalist preachers to middle-aged drummers a reason to get up in the morning. Heavy-metal fans are not only cranking up the volume in their American-made muscle cars but living the life in every possible way. They get their hair done at beauty parlors that specialize in "rock-and-roll hair." They get jobs through placement agencies that understand their "special needs." They frequently wear the skin of animals, like snake, lizard and cow. Accessorized by chains and other bikeresque hardware, the clothing symbolizes exactly the same thing it did 20 years ago (and probably 20 years before that) -- bad to the bone.
And the subculture shows no signs of extinction. In fact, as latter-20th-century life appears to be getting louder, faster and more crowded, so too does the world of heavy metal, now featuring countless clubs nationwide, myriad journals, fanzines and comic books catering to every conceivable gradation of metal mania, every manner of rude dudeness.
On weekends in Los Angeles, the loud crowd gathers big at clubs like F.M. Station, Gazzari's and the Bordello; in Tampa, Fla., at the Filling Station; in Tempe, Ariz., at the Cat House; at the Scrap Bar in Greenwich Village, and every Tuesday night at Beowulf in Manhattan. When not club-hopping, inquiring dudes keep up to date with journals like Screamer, Rip, Mean Street, East Coast Rocker, Thrust, Metal Machine, Metal Shop, Metal Maniacs and New Underground Magazine, a comic book that predicts that in the year 2060, the world will end and heavy metal, the only music to weather the big blast, will provide survivors with a moral code.
For the watchwords of today, headbangers dial the 24-hour hotline for dozens of bands. ("We might be doing a song for 'Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure II,' " says the recorded message for the group Faster Pussycat. "We'll know more on that later. . . . Go, Kings.") Fans looking for a vacation spot head for the Cabo Wabo Cantina, a Mexican nightclub co-owned by the guitar-speedster Eddie Van Halen, and fans with a craving for venison subscribe to Ted Nugent's World Bowhunters magazine.
They also keep tattoo parlors in business. Their beverage of choice is Budweiser, according to KNAC demographics, which also reports that most of them are 18- to 34-year-old males, although there's a not-unnoticed over-40 crowd, of which there are occasional sightings at concerts by older bands. Each category of metal has its own following, with some overlap; but for the most part, fans remain true to their respective schools. For instance, those who prefer the lighter fare of Bon Jovi are not at all charmed by the raw energy of Pantera. Nevertheless, these fans share a particular sensibility: many are working class, and their music of choice reflects their alienation. (It is significant that heavy metal, along with its angry black counterpart, rap, is the voice of another group of disenfranchised citizens, teen-agers.)
In the case of Damn Yankees, Ted Nugent's new group, "they're the typical Ted Nugent welding fan," he says. Like Mr. Nugent, his fans work with metal every day of their lives; for them, the streets of America are paved with steel, not gold. "They do a great job on the line, they work their behinds off to fulfill family responsibilities, and they won't follow anyone blindly," says Mr. Nugent.
In a statement issued at a recent heavy-metal convention, Dave Mustaine of Megadeth compared his band to its fans: "We're average. We're not rocket scientists and we're not wino bums. We're not like a bazillion years old and we're not fetuses with headphones."
In other words, the guy whom modern witch-hunters like to think of as being possessed by evil is actually completely dispossessed; he's the welder whose job has suddenly disappeared along with his pension fund, any alienated Joe (or Jane) who needs a mega-blast of electricity to get to work -- or the unemployment line -- in the morning.
Metal heads may not rank very high on the socioeconomic food chain, but they are certainly not embarrassed. "They're the most vocal fans of anyone in the world," says Riki Rachtman, host of "Headbangers' Ball" on MTV and co-owner of the Bordello and the Cat House. "The most frequently requested videos on MTV are heavy metal. Compare those to the Top 10 based on sales, and there's a huge difference."
Says Tawn Mastrey: "Heavy metal fans know what they want, and when they don't get it, they let you know. Someone at KNAC once played 'Helter Skelter,' and we got a lot of listener complaints. Not enough edge." Had they known that Charles Manson evidently took a cue from this song by the Beatles, would fans have approved? If Ms. Mastrey had the answer, she could be running focus groups for the Rand Corporation. Nonetheless, she seems to have an accurate reading of the dude pulse.
"Remember two years ago when Jethro Tull won the first heavy metal Grammy?" she asks. "If I played Jethro Tull, the station would get bombed." Another metal gaffe is the Rolling Stones. "The all-time lowest-selling issue of Rip," according to its editor, Lon Friend, "was the one with the Stone on the cover." As KNAC radio claims, true metal fans "rock harder and longer." Or, as the group Slaughter screams in their anthem: "Up all night, sleep all day."
For fans who are unable to sleep all day, Slaughter's boast translates into any number of things. For some, it means doing whatever it takes to follow the activities of their favorite band. Twenty-eight-year-old Gilda Caserta, for instance, publishes a quarterly fanzine called Kiss Fire, which is all about Kiss, the group that shaped her adolescence. Now a copy editor at Woman's Day, Ms. Caserta no longer plans her life around her favorite group. But she still takes personally the fact that although Kiss continues to play to sell-out crowds around the country, the band has never been appreciated by critics.
"They were doing the hair and the makeup before everyone else," she says (but not before the New York Dolls, upon whom they based their look). "And because of that, they were unfairly singled out by fundamentalists. I don't see why people get so upset about them. In the 40's and 50's there were sex songs like 'Makin' Whoopee.' Heavy metal presents the same thing in a different light."
Other fans announce their taste in wattage via hairstyle. Everyone has seen the balding executive with a ponytail dashing for the 5:43 to Westport. Most likely, this is a follower of Tom Petty. But what about the pool boy with the palm-tree hair? Chances are, he's a Scorpions kind of a guy. "Everyone wants to look like Nikki Sixx," reports Melissa Lopez, a Van Nuys, Calif., hairdresser who specializes in "rock-and-roll hair." Mr. Sixx is the bass player in Motley Crue, the model for a look that is now standard at gas stations and construction sites around the country.
Then there are fans who express team identification simply by playing "air guitar" -- not "air flute" or "air bongos" -- when they want to invoke coolness or power. And finally there are fans who are paid to be fans. Since actual fans are often not reliable enough to answer fan mail, some groups hire a professional service to take care of such chores.
Judith Krain is one such fan. As president of Fan Line, she supervises clubs for groups like Guns 'n' Roses, Skid Row, Great White and Slayer, which generates the most mail. "They get letters from all over the world," says Ms. Krain, "and some fans write every day. The Germans and Scandinavians are the most literate, whereas the Americans sometimes can't even make out an envelope. By far the very best letters come from the Japanese, who include reply cards, and if they get an answer send you gifts."
Slayer records on Def American, home to Andrew Dice Clay (a heavy-metal Don Rickles) as well as to five metal bands. "When rock heroes say don't do drugs and have safe sex," says Rick Rubin, the label president, "and along comes a band like Guns 'n' Roses, which is about aggressively not caring, then that's when rock-and-roll becomes exciting again." Slayer is perhaps one of the most aggressively not-caring rock entities since Sid Vicious. "There is something arty in how not musical it is," Mr. Rubin says. "With other groups you get a sense of history. It's not here." Perhaps ignorance explains why the group's fan club is called the Slaytanic Wehrmacht.
On a recent "KNAC Night" at the Florentine Gardens in Hollywood, several hundred metal heads had gathered for a showcase of new bands. Since hundreds of metal outfits vie for ear-space in Southern California, landing a gig here is a serious rite of passage. The emcee guided the devout in their worship of those two holy grails, the amplifier and the fuzz box (devices that produce the sound that makes people make that funny face when they play air guitar). As the bands thrashed on, the regulation heavy-metal lingerie slides were flashed on the wall.
Blasted by lyrics that invoked the stone age of male-female communication, many women gathered near the stage, hoping for the once-over from the sexiest band members, preferably the guy on bass.
Would it be better if heavy metal sang the praises of a politically correct world?
Hey, it's only rock-and-roll, and I like it.
 
 
 
THE DAWN OF THE IRON AGE
 What is heavy metal, exactly? Once upon a time, heavy metal was simply known as rock-and-roll. This was during the old-world order, when pasta was spaghetti and gay meant merry. No one knows exactly when it happened, or even what it was, but one day everything changed. Suddenly, rock-and-roll was heavy metal.
Some say it happened when Jimi Hendrix set his guitar on fire. Others say no, no, no, that wasn't it at all; it happened when Jerry Lee Lewis set his piano on fire. Then there are those who say heavy metal began the day Mrs. O'Leary's cow set Chicago on fire. While the debate rages, there is widespread agreement on one point: Billy Joel did not start the fire.
Hippie lore places "blame" for heavy metal on Bob Dylan, who "plugged in" his guitar at the Newport Jazz Festival in 1965 and thus perverted the instrument by "going electric." Paradoxically, Guns 'n' Roses, a group that wouldn't exist without electricity, recently recorded "Knockin' on Heaven's Door," one of Dylan's most popular tunes, thus introducing his message to a new generation of metal fans.
Nowadays, the term heavy metal refers to veteran three-alarm bands like Judas Priest, AC/DC, Iron Maiden and many others but also includes so many newer bands that the category has subdivided. There is speed metal (louder and faster, like Metallica and Megadeth), thrash (really loud and fast, no kidding around this time, as in Slayer and Danzig), glam (loud, fast, hair spray, maybe some mascara, very pretty, such as Warrant and Poison), metal-funk (critically acclaimed, no references to Lucifer so far, as in Faith No More and Living Colour), and even bands that are cited as thinking man's metal (Queensryche).
Penelope Spheeris, director of the documentary "The Decline of Western Civilization, Part II: The Metal Years," suggests that "new technology will soon allow musicians to play louder and faster than ever before." But the metal demi-god Ozzy Osbourne, who hates the term heavy metal, sees the future differently. "Pretty soon," he says, "concerts will disappear because bands will just phone in their gigs."

The Tall Truths of a Yarn Spinner

BYLINE: By DAVID RICHARDS

 BODY:
After all the bad blood stirred up on Broadway by "Miss Saigon," along comes "The Will Rogers Follies" to make things better again.
 More than better. A-O.K. Jim dandy. 
 Preceded by no weekly updates on the advance ticket sales, no protests over its casting, no now-it's-off-now-it's-on-again bulletins, it opened recently at the newly minted Palace Theater with next to no fanfare, unless you regard the 35-foot cowgirls above the marquee to be fanfare. But you can bet a lot of people are going to be talking about it from here on in. This, I suspect, is the musical audiences were really waiting for, all the time the paid drumbeaters told them they were waiting for "Miss Saigon."
 It boasts sumptuous production numbers, exquisite chorus girls, phosphorescent rope tricks in black light, a dog act, songs you actually want to hum, a stairway to paradise (or somewhere thereabouts), close harmony, shapely legs in kaleidoscopic patterns, and a thoroughly engaging star performance by Keith Carradine, as the laconic cowboy-philosopher from Oklahoma.
You do not come away from so much abundance, however, feeling satiated. Astutely built into the extravaganza by its incessantly inventive director-choreographer, Tommy Tune, is a heartfelt acknowledgment of the hard times the country happens to be currently experiencing. Without being maudlin, "The Will Rogers Follies" says we'll get through. Without being jingoistic, it says Americans usually do.
Probably the most widely known advocate of common sense since Tom Paine, Rogers was a vaudeville performer, radio personality, newspaper columnist and motion picture star before his untimely death in an airplane crash in 1935. During the 1920's, he was also one of the regular headliners in the Follies, Florenz Ziegfeld's yearly endorsement of conspicuous consumption and the female anatomy. Hence the basic idea behind the show. Why not make Rogers's own story the stuff of a Ziegfeld production? Rogers could offer running commentary about himself and the passing scene, as he did in his day. The lavish numbers, presumably, could be used to illustrate some of the life's highlights. By subtitling the whole affair "A Life in Revue" -- as indeed the show's creators have done -- you could even underline the connection beforehand and get a pun out of it.
All right, the premise is not foolproof. It is even seriously flawed. Whose existence naturally lends itself to the mindless glitter Ziegfeld splashed across the stage? Before his death, Liberace was already his own Ziegfeld revue, and Zsa Zsa Gabor, alas, seriously jeopardized her prospects by slapping the police. The fit is just not going to be all that exact, whoever the subject may be. That is probably why the book writer Peter Stone has the voice of Ziegfeld (played by the voice of Gregory Peck) intervene periodically to make sure that his time-honored theatrical tenets are being enforced, and to hell with what really happened.
When the moment comes for Rogers to meet his future wife, Betty (Dee Hoty, all fresh, warm and wonderful), Ziegfeld rejects the Oklahoma setting where the meeting actually took place and insists, instead, that it unfold "on the moon." Accordingly, the set designer Tony Walton provides a silvery vision of the planets in a sky of midnight blue, and the costumer Willa Kim drapes Ms. Hoty in moonbeam white. (Erte surely would have turned green.) Still, the transposition is forced -- beyond silly. "You're so down to . . . moon," stammers Betty, struggling to make the necessary adjustment, while she's gazing adoringly into the eyes of her ingenuous beau. Not very clever, that.
And let's face it, an animal act is an animal act. The six canines billed as Brackney's Madcap Mutts (five daredevils, one showoff) are incontestably the best thing I've ever seen on 24 legs. The show manages to work them in under the banner of the St. Louis World's Fair of 1904, at which Rogers proposes to his future wife. But we're still facing the same problem -- one man's biography butting up against another man's format.
If Mr. Tune were not the extraordinary showman he is, and Mr. Carradine were a less affable presence, "The Will Rogers Follies" would probably crack right up the middle. But the union holds. In the second act, it flourishes.
Consider, by way of proof, "Favorite Son," the production number that serves to commemorate Rogers's entrance into Presidential politics in 1928 -- on the not altogether serious "anti-bunk" ticket. To a razzle-dazzle campaign ditty by the composer Cy Coleman, Mr. Tune has devised an ingenious routine for 16 seated chorus girls, who clap their hands, pat their thighs, cross and uncross their legs in crisp patterns that suggest the child's game of pat-a-cake raised to the power of about 20 or so.
The precision is enough to boggle anyone who ever had trouble rubbing his stomach and patting his head at the same time. There, however, dead center in the red-white-and-blue line, grinning like the cat that ate the cream and wouldn't mind seconds, is Mr. Carradine. He's clapping, patting, crossing and uncrossing with the best of them, but there's no sign on his blissful face that any of this is costing him the slightest effort. The more complicated Mr. Tune makes the routine, the easier it seems to be for Mr. Carradine to follow along. The rivalry is certainly good-natured, if you can even call it rivalry. But it's also clearly responsible for the spring in the number.
Whatever its claims, "The Will Rogers Follies" does not find its drama in the events of Rogers's life, although the one-eyed aviator Wiley Post, seated in a box, is on hand to call out periodically, "Let's go flying, Will," and remind us of the inevitable ending. Rogers's private existence has been largely boiled down to two running misunderstandings -- one with his father (Dick Latessa), who disapproves of his son's choice of show business as a career; the other with his wife, who has no quibbles with show business, but wishes her husband devoted less time to it.
The show's real drama has far more to do with the pairing of two diametrically opposed temperaments -- Mr. Tune, exuberant, excitable, always on the lookout for a way to top himself; Mr. Carradine, sly, unflappable, looking just as keenly for a way to undercut himself. Mr. Tune takes the show up. Mr. Carradine takes it down. The one's incipient giddiness is chastened by the other's tongue-in-cheek wryness, just as the wryness is sharpened, vitalized, by the enveloping high spirits. The relationship is not only mutually beneficial, but it lends a continuing dynamic to what otherwise might be just a sequence of numbers hitched to the passing years.
The evening's most opulent indulgence, "Presents for Mrs. Rogers," is, in fact, abruptly stopped in its spangled tracks to make place for Rogers's plainest speaking. In a tribute to rare jewels, the Ziegfeld girls, each spectacularly costumed to represent a different gem, have been parading majestically down the staircase. And the staircase, not to be thought disobliging, has been regularly changing its color -- red, when rubies are being saluted; blue for the onslaught of sapphires; green for the wave of emeralds. Then, the Depression strikes.
The lighting designer Jules Fisher pulls the plug on the bright lights, stagehands dismantle the set, and wardrobe mistresses rush on to reclaim the elegant costumes, forcing the stunned chorus girls to wrap themselves in gray sheets. Cady Huffman, Ziegfeld's favorite, gazes out into the hall, hoping for a reassuring word from her protector. But the panache has gone out of her strut, and Ziegfeld is noticeably silent.
The company's sagging spirits are the country's, too, and for once, Rogers isn't sure he can rally them. Head bowed by the gravity of the assignment, Mr. Carradine steps up to a microphone and admits he's as baffled as the next man by the homeless everywhere, the hunger, the inequity. "We hold the distinction of being the only nation in the history of the world that ever went to the poorhouse in an automobile," he says. The words are Rogers's own and were delivered over the radio in 1931 at the invitation of President Herbert Hoover, who had just addressed the nation on the mounting unemployment. They've not gone out of date. Only the easygoing delivery -- content to let an irony rise or fall on its proper merits -- signals a different era. And when he asks, "Where are all the big men? Lord, we could sure use one now," even irony is temporarily set aside.
No Broadway musical in its right mind would leave things at that. And "The Will Rogers Follies" doesn't. Slowly, steadily, it builds from there to its uplifting finale. The only difference is that the build is undertaken by Mr. Carradine and Mr. Tune working in tandem, coming at matters from the same angle. The occasion is "Never Met a Man I Didn't Like," a catchy country-western-flavored melody with appropriately homespun lyrics by Betty Comden and Adolph Green. Mr. Carradine -- standing center stage, an overcoat thrown over his arm, hat in his hand -- is not about to change his basic manner. The mocking twinkle has been extinguished, however. That's his part of the bargain.
With each refrain, Mr. Tune enlarges the number surrounding him. But he does so without setting off fireworks at the star's feet. That's his concession. Faintly, at first, then with increasing distinctness, the homely faces of common Americans come into focus on the scrim behind Mr. Carradine. And just as faintly, too, the voices of the chorus join in. Before long, the sea of faces stretches off into infinity, and Mr. Carradine's voice is riding the crest of a full choir. But no one's stirring. Mr. Carradine is still center stage -- coat on arm, hat in hand -- standing firmly by his humble credo. Theatrically speaking, however, a reconciliation has been effected. One man's modesty and another man's flair have been triumphantly joined.
All that remains is for Rogers to take up Wiley Post's offer, climb the stairs into the billowing white clouds and go flying. The show, by this point, has long since been airborne.

HEADLINE: Fresh Air Fund Builds Lasting Links

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO

 BODY:
IN July, Lisa Carena of North Stamford will welcome a visitor from the Bronx. For two weeks, 10-year-old Nina Washington will make her third summertime visit to Ms. Carena's home as part of the Fresh Air Fund's program to bring poor city children to the country.
 Ms. Carena, whose family has been visited by Fresh Air Fund children for the past nine summers, said the hosts gain as much from the experience as the city youngsters. 
 The visitors "gave a lot," said Ms. Carena's 10-year-old daughter, Elizabeth. "During the summer, I would be real lonely, and they would give me friendship."
The Fresh Air Fund is an independent, nonprofit organization that gives free summer vacations to poor children. The fund was founded in 1877 by the Rev. Willard Parsons, a minister in Sherman, Pa., who requested that members of his congregation provide rural vacations for 60 children from New York City. Today, families from Maine to Delaware sponsor Fresh Air Fund children. Ms. Carena, who is the fund's chairwoman for Stamford and Greenwich, said 22 families in the area had volunteered as hosts for this summer.
 
Learning to Swim
 Ms. Carena said finding hosts in Fairfield County is difficult, because many families send their children away to camp, and because the recession has made a stay-at-home-parent an unaffordable luxury. She added that hosts can send their Fresh Air guests to day camp along with their own children.
"They don't have to baby-sit all the time," said Ms. Carena, who works part time.
In past summers, Ms. Carena said, Nina has learned skills like swimming.
"We tried to teach her how to ride a two-wheel bicycle," Elizabeth said. "And we will probably try to teach her again this summer."
 Ms. Carena said she had been surprised by the reaction of city children to country life.
"They are so full of fear," she said. "Nina is still not totally confident that there are not big animals hiding out there in the woods."
She added, "These children are never in the dark."
 
'We Don't Hit Anybody'
 Other cultural differences show themselves during the visits, Ms. Carena said. "We tried to explain to Nina not to throw garbage out the car window," she said. "She didn't know why not."
And when Nina was found improperly taking money, she said, the child was stunned to learn that she would not be hit for her misdeed.
"I told her we don't hit anybody," Ms. Carena said. "She was quite taken aback by that."
Some Fresh Air Fund children also have a slang-littered vocabulary that is difficult, if not impossible, for a host parent to alter, especially during such a short period, she said.
"You're not going to change these kids," Ms. Carena said. "What I'm hoping to do is give them a focus and encourage them to do something with a future."
 
Never Met Apartment Dweller
 The Carena family has had other Fresh Air guests over the past nine years. One of their favorites was Siegfredo Traverso of the Bronx, known as Ziggy, who first visited when he was 9 and has kept in touch ever since.
Ms. Carena said the experience has proved especially useful for her own children, who live a sheltered life. Besides Elizabeth, she and her husband, Joseph Carena Jr., have two older children, Alexis, 17, and Joe 3d, 15.
"They had never met someone that even lived in an apartment," Ms. Carena said.
Sending a child to visit a host family costs the fund $314, mainly for transporation and insurance, and it costs $819 to send a child to one of its camps. Tax-deductible contributions may be sent to the Fresh Air Fund, 1040 Avenue of the Americas, New York, N.Y. 10018. Connecticut families who wish to be hosts may volunteer by calling (800) 367-0003.

HEADLINE: DINING OUT;
Second-Story Restaurant, Two-Tier Menu

BYLINE: By PATRICIA BROOKS

 BODY:
STONE HORSE, yet another new restaurant in New Canaan, has totally revamped the spacious second story of a building it shares with the New Canaan Racquet Club.
The restaurant, which is a visual delight, has three dining areas (one smoking, two nonsmoking tiered ones) and well-spaced tables. The lively bar is separated from the nonsmoking sections by and a central divider of white columns, assorted plants and fresh flowers in handsome terra cotta planters and a large gray-white pony-size stone horse. Except for overloud taped music in the early dining hours, the atmosphere is one of comfortable, casual dining. 
 Stone Horse's menu reflects the current mood of economizing: In addition to the regular entrees, there is a category called "Stone Horse specialties." These are 10 entrees -- with a nice range of choices -- at prices from $6.50 to $9.95. Regular entree prices run from $12.95 to $17.75. The considerable price difference means portions that are slightly smaller (though still hefty) and no salad included. But even these smaller entrees are nearly enough to feed a horse. All entrees are served throughout the day, as are the sandwiches and pizzas. Fair warning: entree portions are sufficiently large to eliminate the need of a starter.
In addition to the regular all-purpose menu, there are daily specials (thoughtfully printed and clipped to each menu), including chowder, pot pie and quiche of the day. On the whole, our experiences with the specials proved more consistent than some of the menu standards. Especially rewarding were two soups: a rich cream of broccoli (pureed, with several fresh broccoli flowerets) and a creamy New England clam chowder (good flavor, despite only micro-sized clam bits).
Other specials to savor, when available, are the rainbow trout amandine (lightly sauteed with almonds in lemon butter) and crisp Long Island duck (well prepared and crispy skinned in a minimally sweetened sauce of fresh raspberries). One night, fresh asparagus and ham quiche made a totally satisfying light meal.
Lamb pot pie, also a special, was a huge ramekin full of hearty lamb chunks and carrots, with a crisp, brown puff pastry topper. Not a conventional pie, but tasty. A chicken pot pie with similar topping was a disastrous mush, however, reminiscent of a chicken fricassee that expired en route.
Inconsistency can be a diner's peril at Stone Horse. Examples abound: swordfish "with anchovy bread crumbs" was served with no hint of anchovy; fillet of Norwegian salmon, ordered rare, was cooked dry; Louisiana bouilabaisse was heavily oversalted; the crust surrounding baked ham and brie en croute was rubbery.
Best to order judiciously, concentrating on the menu's simpler items. On the whole, the sandwiches were well made and enormous. Either grilled pastrami or sirloin hamburger (enhanced by a melted cheddar or Swiss cheese topping) was a meal, along with a side order of paper-thin, greaseless, crisp onion rings.
Plump grilled mussels (actually steamed in an herb-enriched tomato broth), clams casino, bruschetta (toasted bread piled high with chopped fresh tomatoes) and crisp zucchini chips all made suitable starters. Among the regular entrees, our wisest choice was roast rack of lamb (four rare, meaty and tender little chops). Seafood crepe made a delicious light entree (a happy combination of scallops and shrimp in a sherry cream sauce). Caesar salad, available as the house salad, was a generous plate full of crisp, egg-coated and cheese-sprinkled romaine leaves, tasty even without the usual anchovies. Piping hot miniature blueberry muffins, served with commercial rolls, were a welcome bonus. The best desserts were a fluffy cheesecake and strawberry mousse cake.
Stone Horse is still new, and its kitchen and serving inconsistencies may shake out as time passes. An on-the-scene manager would help shorten the long waits between courses and other staff forgetfulness. Meanwhile, this handsome new place offers friendly, casual and moderately priced family dining. Before tax, tip and drinks, we spent $41.15 on two three-course dinners (one course too many for normal appetites).

HEADLINE: ALMA MATERS COURT THEIR DAUGHTERS

 BODY:
If Anne Matthews had extended her research to a few women's colleges, she could have discovered how to raise significant funds from alumnae at coed colleges and universities ("Alma Maters Court Their Daughters," April 7).
My alma mater raised more than $163 million between 1984 and 1989 in the Campaign for Smith College. In spite of tax reform and a volatile economy, we were able to surpass our goal of $152 million by informing alumnae of campus needs and by personal solicitation. 
 The secret is to celebrate the generosity of alumnae to other charitable causes, while continuing to ask them to contribute to the institution that, in all likelihood, first made them aware of community needs.
Matthews is right when she says that raising money from women is different from raising money from men. There is less quid pro quo and more need to make connections between the money and the outcomes of the programs involved. This was as true for small donations ($100) as it was for leadership gifts ($100,000 and up) in the campaign for Smith.

 BODY:

 
SKINNER TO SPEAK
 Trains, planes, roadways and seaways in Westchester and nationwide will be discussed Wednesday during the dinner meeting of the Westchester County Association, to be held at the Rye Town Hilton.
 The principal speaker will be Samuel Knox Skinner, United States Secretary of Transportation and the President's chief adviser on transportation issues and the economic problems surrounding them.
 In charge of 100,000 employees and a budget of $28 billion, Mr. Skinner oversees the Federal Aviation Administration, the Coast Guard, and seven other organizations dealing with maritime, highway, railroad, mass-transit, highway-safety and research programs.
 He will touch on actions under way to implement his Statement of National Transportation Policy, setting forth an agenda for the 21st century, some of which relates directly to the Westchester highway and transit systems.
 At 5 P.M. a special report by representatives of Westchester 2000 -- a group of leaders in the county that is looking for ways to improve life by the turn of the century -- , will cover county problems and successes in strategies for housing, education, intergovernmental relations, health and human services. A reception at 6:15 will be followed by dinner and Mr. Skinner's speech. Tickets are $90 and reservations can be made by calling 948-6444.
 
NEW CASTLE BICENTENNIAL
 One of several programs celebrating the town of New Castle's bicentennial is a talk by William McFeely today at 4 P.M. in the Quaker Meeting House, at 420 Quaker Road (Route 120) in Chappaqua. Mr. McFeely's subject will be "Frederick Douglass and the Quaker Radicals," based on his new book, a biography titled "Frederick Douglass."
 Mr. McFeely is a professor of history at the University of Georgia and a Pulitzer Prize winner in 1982 for his book about Ulysses S. Grant , titled "Grant: A Biography." His account of Douglass's extraordinary life, from slave to celebrated anti-slavery orator, was chosen by three book clubs, including the Book of the Month. Both biographies were published by Norton.
 The New Castle Historical Society recently published an oversize illustrated paperback, "A Bicentennial History of the Town of New Castle, 1791-1991." Among the remaining bicentennial events are a strawberry festival Saturday from 11 A.M. to 4 P.M. on the grounds of the historic Episcopal Church of St. Mary the Virgin on South Greeley Avenue in Chappaqua; and a Revolutionary Encampment and Battle in Gedney Park in New Castle, on May 25 from 11 A.M. to 4:30 P.M. Everything is free. For more information, call 238-4771.
 
'DOROTHY PARKER'
 Dorothy Parker, the author and wit, is being portrayed on the stage by Tina Sattin, the actress and director, in "What Fresh Hell Is This? An Evening With Dorothy Parker" at the Schoolhouse Theater in Croton Falls.
 In a series of six short monologues and two lengthier solo pieces -- all written by Parker -- Ms. Sattin at times speaks as the writer, and at times she becomes one of the characters created by Parker.
 "The Telephone Call," one of the longer pieces, concerns a woman who waits for and receives the phone call from Hell -- her lover telling her that it's all over. In "The Waltz," a society woman politely endures the attentions of wearisome dance partners at a soiree, while yearning for one man who is absent.
 Ms. Sattin founded and is the director of the Open Cage, a theatrical troupe housed in a former high school at 60 South Third Avenue in Mount Vernon. She has appeared in "To Be Young, Gifted and Black" and "Member of the Wedding" on television, and in other productions on and off Broadway. Her performance as Billie Holiday in "Lady Day at the Emerson Bar & Grill" by Lanie Robertson, seen last October at the Schoolhouse, will be repeated there next fall.
 Performances of "An Evening with Dorothy Parker" are at 3 P.M. today and 8 P.M. Friday and Saturday. Tickets at $12.50 may be reserved by calling 277-8477.
 
CHILDREN AND ARTS
 Dr. Sirgay Sanger, founder of the Parent Child Center at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan and a noted child psychiatrist, will talk about "The Arts and Children: Health Promotion for the 90's" Friday at 8 P.M. in Golden's Bridge.
 Drama, dance, music and the visual arts as means of communicating more profoundly with children, and the attendant benefits to children in terms of self-expression and self-esteem, are strongly advocated by Dr. Sanger and are gaining currency in the education community at a time when funds are being cut in many schools.
 Following the talk, to be given at the Northern Westchester Center for the Arts on Old Bedford Road, there will be an open discussion and the audience can view "Visions of a Better World," an exhibition of children's art.
 Dr. Sanger, a graduate of Harvard College and the Harvard Medical School, has written several books on parents and children and their emotional connections. His latest book, "Baby Talk, Parent Talk," was published this year by Doubleday. Admission to the program is free. Call 232-5740 for more information.
 
ARTFUL CHILDREN
 Young artists from 23 schools in Westchester, Putnam and Fairfield Counties will have their own juried art exhibition at the Katonah Museum of Art Saturday through May 26. One hundred high school students will exhibit more than 100 paintings, sculptures, graphics, photographs and metalworks that were judged by teachers to be the best in their schools.
 The show not only gives budding artists an opportunity for public scrutiny of their work, but provides experience in planning, advertising, hanging and being the hosts for their exhibition.Guided by professionals, the students produced the invitations, posters and program; pondered which works looked best where and how far apart; hammered the nails and set up the sculpture, and now will welcome the guests.
 The museum, on Route 22 at Jay Street in Katonah, is open free of charge Tuesdays through Fridays and on Sundays from 1 to 5 P.M.; and Saturdays from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. For more information, call 232- 9555.

HEADLINE: An American Wrestles With a Troubled Future

BYLINE: By ERIC N. BERG

DATELINE: OAK BROOK, Ill.

 BODY:
For the McDonald's Corporation whose name, golden arches and Big Mac are American icons -- a reckoning is at hand.
For two years, maybe more, McDonald's restaurants in the United States have been struggling to prevent a decline in their business from snowballing. 
 The reasons for the fall: restaurants that cost far more than many rivals' to build and are a permanent drag on earnings; prices that long ago stretched the budgets of many fast-food customers, and a menu that remains the bane of cardiologists and weight watchers, despite the recent introduction of the low-fat burger, McLean Deluxe. The impact of the decline: financial results that have been a painful disappointment.
While some competitors continue to report strong sales increases, many McDonald's restaurants have had flat to negative numbers since 1988, after adjusting for inflation. In the first quarter of this year, the typical company-owned outlet in the United States saw inflation-adjusted sales fall 3 percent from the same period a year earlier, according to Montgomery Securities Inc. of San Francisco. For the typical franchisee, the decline was even bigger -- 7 percent.
By comparison, the typical Taco Bell's sales in the last quarter were up about 3 percent after adjusting for inflation. Wendy's rose 3.2 percent; and at Cracker Barrel, a mid-priced chain in the Southeast, sales jumped 7 percent.
Most of McDonald's troubles are at home. For the first quarter of 1991, the company's net income rose 6.6 percent, thanks to strong foreign sales. But in the United States alone, operating income fell 2 percent. For all of 1990, the typical company-owned domestic outlet saw its operating income fall 7 percent, to $254,500.
The company's ills underscore just how much the fast-food business has changed in the 36 years since the first McDonald's was built -- and how far behind McDonald's has fallen. As the population has aged, customers have become far more sensitive to the healthfulness of what they eat. And the recession has cut deeply into many family food budgets.
Some chains are growing nicely by taking business from leaders like McDonald's. Mid-priced chains like Baker's Square have surged by offering healthier fare and table service for not much more than what some counter-service outlets charge. And Pepsico Inc.'s Taco Bell has scored big with Mexican meals for about $1.
 
 Heading South
 "McDonald's is still a business in which a guy working hard can earn a six-figure income, but the critical issue is the trend, which has been south for some time," said Michael G. Mueller, the Montgomery Securities restaurant analyst. Added Tiger Warren, chairman of Macheesmo Mouse, a Mexican-restaurant chain based in Portland, Ore.: "The halcyon days are over. McDonald's will always be the biggest, but more and more people are chipping away at its base and its competitors have gotten a lot smarter."
Suddenly, however, McDonald's has decided to tackle its problems head on. It has begun a campaign to cut hundreds of thousands of dollars off the construction cost of its restaurants. It has been slashing prices on everything from cheeseburgers to pancakes. And for those who still consider its food to be one step up from Gummi Bears and Twinkies, it has been adding healthier and reduced-calorie fare -- like oat-bran muffins, low-fat salad dressings and the McLean Deluxe.
McDonald's is at a crossroads. If its reforms are successful, sales and profits at the company's 8,600 domestic restaurants should resume their upward trek, and McDonald's will retain its position as a premier growth companies. But if it cannot right itself, McDonald's will cease being the model of excellence that it has been since 1955, when Ray A. Kroc, a former blender salesman, founded the chain. McDonald's would become just another combatant in the increasingly glutted world of fast food -- far more than a bit player but vastly diminished in importance.
Most fast-food experts will not predict the outcome. They note that McDonald's is only beginning to make some of its changes and that the company has been resilient in the past. But they also say that there will always be fast-food restaurants with lower overhead that can charge less.
For their part, some United States franchisees are already folding rather than risk further declines.
"I would like to stay in the system, but I see no future in it," said Joan Fiore, who recently sold the last of five McDonald's restaurants that she and her husband owned in New York City. "I think if we stayed in the system, eventually our restaurants would be valueless."
That may still be a minority view, however. McDonald's executives, including Michael R. Quinlan, the 46-year-old chief executive, believe investing in a McDonald's franchise remains the closest thing to a sure bet. They point to a long waiting list of people wanting a franchise and to the large number of operators earning six-figure incomes.
"They're in very good shape as a whole," Mr. Quinlan said in a recent interview at McDonald's headquarters here, referring to the 6,900 franchises in the United States. (The company owns 1,600 domestic restaurants, and it owns about a third of the 3,300 restaurants in the hugely successful overseas operation.)
But the chain's results suggest that many of its domestic outlets have been battling to keep even, at least in sales volume. And not just for a few quarters. The deterioration appears to have started in 1985.
That year, the average company-owned domestic outlet had $1.3 million in sales, a gain of only three-tenths of 1 percent over 1984 after adjusting for price increases. Since then, adjusted sales have declined every year except 1987, when they rose a modest 2.7 percent. For the three months ended March 31, sales fell in real terms, by about 3 percent.
One key problem is the cost of new restaurants, which come with top-of-the-line kitchen equipment and amusements for children, like playgrounds. It is simply uneconomical to have a Mercedes-Benz for a building when more rivals than ever are vying for the business, analysts say.
Indeed, since Mr. Kroc stepped down as chief executive in 1973, hundreds of newcomers have streamed into the market. There have been plenty of new burger restaurants, of course, like Rally's, a Louisville, Ky.-based chain that offers drive-through service only. But McDonald's now must also compete with convenience stores like 7-Eleven, with gas stations, with delicatessens -- in short, with anyone selling reheatable food. The last few years have also witnessed an explosion in the number of mid-priced restaurant chains, like Chili's and Baker's Square.
Worse yet, in a desperate attempt to hang on to customers in a maturing market, rivals across the spectrum have been cutting prices. Leading the way has been Taco Bell.
By comparison, McDonald's restaurants have been hobbled by heavy up-front costs, which not only have squeezed profits directly but also indirectly by making it hard for operators to match rivals' price cuts.
 
The Wrong Way
 Until recently, McDonald's was raising prices. Its price increases have matched or exceeded inflation in 9 of the last 17 years, according to Montgomery's Mr. Mueller
The result is that the company that got rich from the 15-cent hamburger now gives Americans a regular case of fast-food sticker shock, routinely handing out checks for $15 or more to families of four. More important, price increases have sent customers streaming to competitors.
While the erosion is hard to gauge because fast-food market-share data are notoriously unreliable, one figure speaks volumes: Many McDonald's operators have reported little increase in traffic in the last two years, a period in which Taco Bell says it attracted 60 percent more volume. Since the fast-food market is barely growing, the conclusion, analysts say, is that many of these customers were former McDonald's devotees.
"The world changed for McDonald's when Pepsico began focusing on its restaurant businesses," said Caroline Levy, Shearson Lehman Brothers' restaurant analyst.
In fact, the world changed for McDonald's years ago, when the public started worrying about cholesterol and calories. The simple fact is that, long after Americans became conscious of the impact of eating on health, McDonald's core menu remains high in fat and calories. The Big Mac has 560 calories, 52 percent of them coming from fat. While McDonald's is withdrawing the item cardiologists most loathe -- the 580-calorie, 57 percent-fat McDLT -- it continues to promote sandwiches as fattening and fatty as ever. To wit: the McJordan, a 520-calorie, 50 percent-fat, quarter-pound burger with cheese, barbecue sauce and smoked bacon.
 
Refining the Menu
 "Long term, McDonald's still does not have a menu that will be in favor," said Robert Brent, a former marketing executive at Taco Bell, whose menu is not as laden with red meat.
Mr. Quinlan, McDonald's chief executive, acknowledges that the menu needs work, but he maintains that the company is addressing the issue. "Our menu will evolve to be more varied from a nutrition and taste standpoint," he said.
 And although McLean Deluxe may have got the most attention, McDonald's has been steadily updating its menu in recent years, albeit not enough to convince all its critics. It converted to cholesterol-free vegetable oil for french fries and introduced lighter fare like low-fat milk and new salads. A grilled-chicken sandwich could be rolled out any time.
McDonald's has also been paring the cost of building a restaurant. By allowing franchisees to use less brick and more windows, for instance, $25,000 has been saved. All told, McDonald's hopes to identify $200,000 in savings on construction per building.
And the company has begun cutting prices in a big way. It recently introduced a "value menu," with hamburgers being sold for as little as 49 cents, down from 89 cents. And some combinations, like a burger, fries and drink, are as much as half off. The move appears to be a direct parry to Taco Bell, whose drive-throughs have been jammed since it began offering 49 cent tacos.
Competitors have responded to the value menu with even more price cuts. Earlier this year, for instance, Burger King began offering mini-hamburgers for as little as 29 cents.
And then there are the worrisome demographics. Older people in particular tend to view burger chains like McDonald's with suspicion. And many are uncomfortable with having to wait in line. As the population ages, more Americans may opt for the Baker's Square format of economical table service and a menu favoring such fare as broiled fish.
"When we were younger, burgers were O.K.," said Emerson Kendall, the president of Matteson, Ill.-based Baker's Square. "With the emphasis on nutrition, people want a much more balanced approach to their diets."
Despite everything, the company's stock has been rallying of late, closing Friday at $34.25, after falling steadily through the second half of 1990, to a low of about $28. The current rebound apparently reflects the prevailing view that McDonald's is simply too strong to be counted out. Sagging sales or not, McDonald's restaurants in this country still manage to serve more than 20 million people a day.
Over the long haul, "they are too damn smart and have too many resources to allow anybody to take their market away from them," said George Rice, an industry consultant.
 
 
WEEDING OUT FRANCHISEES
 Although McDonald's domestic restaurants have been suffering lately, the company still is one of the world's most successful food-service organizations.
A lot of that can be traced to the rigorous admissions and training process for franchisees. By making the process costly and time consuming to the applicants and, most important, highly selective, McDonald's insures that only top candidates become operators.
The recruitment numbers tell the story. Each year 20,000 people contact McDonald's about obtaining a franchise. Only 2,000 reach the interview stage and fewer than 200 get a restaurant.
Some applicants are rejected because they want to own a McDonald's as a sideline; the company requires its operators to work full time at the business. Others are rejected because they insist on exclusive rights to a territory; McDonald's will franchise only one restaurant at a time.
And not everyone has the cash: while McDonald's either owns or rents the land and restaurant, spending on average $1 million for the property and to construct the building's shell, franchisees must come up with $610,000. This covers kitchen equipment, dining-room furniture, signs and an initial franchise fee of $22,500. Only 60 percent of the $610,000 can be borrowed.
But having the cash is just the beginning. Before being awarded a restaurant, applicants must work two years, typically 15 to 20 hours a week, as unpaid apprentices in a McDonald's restaurant.
From there the candidates are off to Hamburger University, McDonald's two-week residential training center at its Oak Brook, Ill., headquarters. Candidates must complete courses on motivation, hiring, customer relations and managing time.
Even then, McDonald's sometimes goes a step further to make sure applicants are dedicated enough. Upon graduating from Hamburger U., many people are awarded a franchise hundreds of miles from their home, with relocation at their expense.
"That's what enables us to open restaurants where our market research tells us makes sense," said Chuck Ebeling, a McDonald's spokesman.
 
GAINING SPEED AT THE DRIVE-THROUGH WINDOW
 WITH competitors chipping away at their sales and profits, increasing numbers of McDonald's franchisees are using technology to try to gain an edge. Nowhere is this more true than in drive-throughs, from which many McDonald's restaurants now derive close to half of their business.
The first drive-throughs -- indeed, the first McDonald's restaurants -- took a "linear" approach. One person would take an order, assemble and bag the order and then take the customer's money. It was a time-consuming process that turned many drive-throughs into parking lots.
Now consider how McDonald's operates today at its single-lane, double-window drive-throughs:
When a customer gives an order through a two-way intercom, the customer is talking to a crew member sitting at an order-entry computer system. The system not only calculates the bill but transmits details of the order to two overhead television monitors -- one in the kitchen and the other at drive-through window No. 2, where the customer's order normally is delivered.
The moment the customer finishes giving the order, the kitchen crew looks at its screen and swings into action, and the attendant at window 2 uses the screen there to start assembling the needed condiments, napkins and coffee stirrers.
The most advanced restaurants equip the crew members with wireless, battery-powered headsets that allow everyone to hear an order arriving over the intercom. That way, the crew members do not even have to wait for a customer to finish speaking.
"Basically, there is something happening all the time," said Chuck Ebeling, a McDonald's spokesman. "Americans don't object to getting in line as long as that line is moving."

The Seed Money Flow Slows in Computers

BYLINE: By Diana B. Henriques

 BODY:
The high-technology darlings of tomorrow's stock market are incubating in the venture-capital nurseries today. That's the good news. The bad news is that the nanny may be about to give notice.
For the computer industry, in fact, 1990 may become "the year the Great American Venture Capital Machine began to slow down," said Richard A. Shaffer, savvy editor of the Technologic Partners' Computer Letter. Mr. Shaffer estimates that at least 10 of the 300 firms he surveys left the field last year. And at a recent conference, a session titled "How to Wind Down a Venture Capital Firm" drew a capacity crowd, he said. 
 Where will the pain be felt? In California, mostly. At least half of each year's venture activity since 1986 has occurred there. Meanwhile, Mr. Shaffer looks for a rebound in deal activity in Massachusetts, where the weak economy "has made it far easier to find qualified people and inexpensive space to put them in." One startup in the Boston area is operating rent-free for three years.

COMPANIES
 
An Overloaded Occidental Is Shedding Debt
 
When the late Armand Hammer was chairman of the Occidental Petroleum Corporation, he dismissed at least one would-be successor who dared say the company should pare down its debt. But now that Dr. Hammer is gone, Ray R. Irani, Oxy's new chairman, has a free hand. And last week he started moving toward his stated mission of trimming the company's $8.8 billion of debt by $3 billion this year. He made a deal to sell 50 percent of Trident Energy Inc., a producer of liquefied natural gas, for $600 million to a subsidiary of Hicks, Muse & Company, a Dallas-based investment firm. After taxes and other costs, the deal will yield $432 million for Occidental. Then he sold Oxy's North Sea oil and gas holdings for $1.35 billion to France's Societe Nationale Elf Aquitaine and Enterprise Oil P.L.C. of Britain. Mr. Irani is now more than halfway to his goal. And the market likes it. Occidental shares closed the week at $21.125, up $2.125.

NCR -- Who Is the Real Winner?
 
Who benefits most from A.T.& T's $7.4 billion purchase of the NCR Corporation? The American Telephone & Telegraph Company says it does; the deal puts it back in the computer business. But the real winners may be the Wall Street firms that advised the companies during their five-month fight. The advisers get millions in fees at a time when dealmaking is all but dead. Dillon Read & Company and Goldman Sachs & Company, which advised NCR, will each receive about $18.5 million. Morgan Stanley & Company, which advised A.T.& T., will get $13.28 million. Proxy solicitation firms also did well. Morrow & Company will receive $1.7 million and Georgeson & Company will receive $2 million for trying to sway NCR's stockholders. And then there were the lawyers. Two firms will split $20 million for the paperwork.
 
Metromedia's Mighty Returns
 
John W. Kluge, the billionaire chairman of the Metromedia Company, has been making money even in the money-losing cellular-telephone business. His formula has been simple: unload as much of your holdings as you can. Last week, he sold Metromedia's cellular telephone company in Philadelphia for $1.1 billion. The buyer was the Comcast Corporation, an operator of cable television systems there. Metromedia, based in Secaucus, N.J., is one of the nation's largest private partnerships. Since 1986, when it began selling its cellular systems in New York, Washington, Baltimore, Boston and Chicago, the partnership has received $3 billion. The company invested just $20 million in Philadelphia a decade ago. Not a bad return for Mr. Kluge.
 
Troubles for G.M.'s Saturn
 
The General Motors Corporation spent $3.5 billion just to get the Saturn Corporation off the ground. It was supposed to be "a laboratory for all of G.M.," said Ronald Glantz, an automobile analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds in San Francisco. But last week it announced it would be replacing 1,836 of its 1991 model cars that were filled with the wrong coolant. And another laboratory -- one at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration -- said Saturn was not as safe as any of the other cars in its class in a front-end collision. Should G.M. and the nation's Saturn owners be worried? "The data bear little relationship to reality," Mr. Glantz said. "Saturn is under a magnifying glass right now. It was a smooth startup and it's a good product."
 
USX Bidding Farewell to Steel
 
Carl C. Icahn wants the USX Corporation to sell its steel business, the nation's largest. Mr. Icahn, the company's biggest shareholder, is finally getting his way. Last week, shareholders approved a plan to separate the company's stock into two groups. One would comprise the steel business; the other, the Marathon Oil Company. With two groups of stock, the steel business would be easier to sell. Charles A. Corry, the company's chairman, is talking to potential buyers.
 
Of Batteries, Beer and Bunnies
 
First there was "Harvey," the six-foot rabbit in the 1954 movie starring Jimmy Stewart. This time around, there are two: one mechanical and one played by Leslie Nielsen, the star of "Naked Gun." And the bunny masters are suing each other. Eveready, the battery-making subsidiary of the Ralston Purina Company, alleged last week in a lawsuit that the Adolph Coors Company was unfairly parodying its mechanical rabbit in a new series of commercials starring Mr. Nielsen. Coors, in a countersuit, is trying to stop Eveready from interfering with its new campaign. The problem, said Eveready, is that it doesn't want people to associate its bunny with beer.
 
In Brief
 
The Justice Department said a subsidiary of Japan's NEC Corporation agreed to pay $34 million in fines to settle charges that it rigged bids on contracts worth $103 million at an American military base in Japan.

Vegetable prices rose by an astonishing 34.5 percent in April due to a heat wave in Florida. Important, of course, if you like vegetables. But more than that: the jump was enough to throw the entire Producer Price Index out of whack. Prices were up 0.2 percent for the month, according to the Commerce Department. On the other hand, the P.P.I. indicator of inflation showed a 0.4 percent decline in intermediate goods and a 0.5 percent decrease in crude goods. "The trend continues in the right direction," said Mickey Levy, chief economist at C.R.T. Government Securities in New York. "Inflation is coming down."
 
Housing Sales Up, Prices Down
 
The housing slump appears to be bottoming out, even in the Northeast. That is what a survey of bank examiners by the Commerce Department said last week. First-quarter sales were up, but at a cost -- falling prices. In another report, this one by the National Association of Realtors, the median price for a home in the United States slipped 0.5 percent, to $95,400 -- the second quarterly drop in a row.
 
The Productivity Twist and Turn
 
At first it seemed the recession had finally turned the corner -- into depression. American business productivity had fallen nine-tenths of 1 percent during the first quarter, the Labor Department said. But then the department corrected itself. Productivity was not down, it was up -- by a strong 1 percent. Even the revised numbers were perplexing. Productivity, a broad measure of output per hours worked, fell in the manufacturing sector and rose in the service sector, the reverse of a long-running trend. The recession has hurt sales, so manufacturing is down. But why the rise in services? "It may be an anomaly," said said Robert Ortner, former chief economist at the Commerce Department. "Every golden glove winner drops a pop fly now and then."
 
 A Few Fewer Layoffs
 
New claims for unemployment benefits fell 9 percent at the end of April, the Labor Department said. "The layoff rate is diminishing," said Alan Sinai, an economist at the Boston Company. "But we're still in recession."

Iraq Says It Will Pay Later
 
The allies got no spoils from the war with Iraq, only costs. Under the terms of a United Nations Security Council resolution, at least some of those costs -- not yet determined -- are to be paid by Iraq. The resolution calls on United Nations Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar to suggest a maximum percentage of Iraq's oil revenue to be used for rebuilding Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. But in a letter last week to Mr. Perez de Cuellar, Iraq asked for a five-year moratorium on those payments. It needs the time, the letter said, to rebuild its oil exporting capacity to 3 million barrels a day -- its prewar level -- from a current 2 million. It also needs time to repair its infrastructure. After all that is done, the letter said, Iraq will be willing to help rebuild the neighborhood its troops destroyed.
 
Sharing Soviet Power
 
1Boris N. Yeltsin, the popular president of the Russian Republic, is up for election next month. There is little doubt he will win. Even so, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev gave Mr. Yeltsin's campaign a lift when he agreed to transfer control of most of Siberia's coal industry to Russia. The transfer is important because coal is the Soviet Union's principal energy source. It is also important because Mr. Yeltsin has been complaining that Russia controls just 16 percent of its resourceslike oil. Far too little. Transferring the mines is a clear sign that a deal has been struck between by the two leaders. To avert a civil war, they may be ready to share power.
 
Banned in Arabia
 
Since 1967, much of the Arab world has been boycotting the Coca-Cola Company (and hundreds of others) for doing business with Israel. On hot days, Pepsi Cola was the only soft drink around. But in a gesture of thanks to the United States, the Arab League's Boycott Office removed four American companies from its list after the gulf war. Coca Cola, the J.B. Williams Company, Helene Curtis Inc. and the Home Insurance Company can now do business in the Arab Middle East. The only trouble is, 110 companies have been added to the list, including all those in which Britain's Robert Maxwell, new owner of The New York Daily News, has an interest. Mr. Maxwell is starting a Russian language paper in Israel.

HEADLINE: Making a Difference;
Weighing the Facts for Congress

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
In issuing its report last week on the use of genetically engineered growth hormone to boost milk production in cows, the Office of Technology Assessment didn't shrink from controversy.
The Congressional agency issued a point-blank declaration that the hormone poses no danger to cows or to humans who drink their milk, a view at odds with what some consumer groups and state regulators have argued. By so doing, the agency increased the chances that the Government will approve the new drug for widespread commercial use and that Congress will concur. 
 Armed with a tiny budget of $6 million, the agency's director, John H. Gibbons, has made the office important by taking strong stands.
In February, for example, it issued a toughly worded report arguing that the Department of Energy had "neither the capability nor the credibility" to meet its goal of cleaning up radioactive waste from weapons plants in 30 years. In another report that month, the agency argued that policies for disposing of medical waste remain mired in "confusion and inconsistency."
Mr. Gibbons, a 62-year-old physicist with a longstanding interest in energy conservation, is modest about the impact the agency has had in his 12 years as director. "We don't claim to have a big influence," he said. "We're really catalysts. Our job is to provide the movers and shakers with wisdom that is tough to get."
Yet beyond simply answering technical questions, the agency's reports attempt to address the social and economic implications of a technology. Thus, the report on bovine growth hormone went to great lengths describing how the drug could hurt small dairy farmers by lowering milk prices. Likewise, a report on global warming tried to frame strategies for dealing with the problem that would be economically feasible.
Mr. Gibbons admits the conclusions don't always satisfy everyone, but he says most sides to a debate usually agree with the underlying facts cited in the agency's reports.
"We're trying to give members a sense of where all the parties to a debate can stipulate," he said. "It's a heavy weight."

HEADLINE: All About/Computer Retailers;
Superstores Force PC Chains to Reinvent Themselves

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO

 BODY:
For personal computer sellers looking ahead, the future suddenly offers very few alternatives: get big, get specialized or get out.
The entry of a new breed of warehouse-sized superstores is putting the squeeze on traditional computer retailers. As do their predecessors in home furnishings, consumer electronics and toys, the PC superstores offer selection, discounts and convenience. 
 Unable to compete on price with these behemoths, many traditional resellers are closing their retail outlets to concentrate on direct sales to corporate accounts. Here, they say they can sell their "value added" services, like network installations. But by retreating to this higher ground, chains like Computerland, Businessland and MicroAge are, in effect, conceding the home and small-business market to the warehouse stores.
"There has been an evaporation of the middle ground," said Ed Anderson, president of Computerland U.S.A., in Pleasanton, Calif., the nation's largest franchise chain. "You have to make a choice: either go the superstore route for retail, or to a much smaller operation offering networking and service. If you stay in the middle, you're going to die."
Independent dealers and franchisees used to be able to make a good living in the middle ground by offering service with the sale, for which they were able to charge a premium price over the deep discounters and mail-order houses. But the growing sophistication of the customer and the relentless efforts of personal computer manufacturers to make their machines easier to use have eroded the demand for service.
"All of the changes we're seeing are representative of the fact that the customer has changed," said Seymour Merrin, a Palo Alto, Calif.-based PC retailing consultant. "The customer is no longer intimidated by the technology and is no longer willing to pay a premium for hand-holding."
 
Supermarket Concept
Will Big Inventories Become a Handicap?
 There are only a few dozen superstores scattered across the country, but each one that opens can lead to the closing of several traditional computer stores. Of the 5,000 computer dealers in the country today, experts expect that by 1995, 2,000 will convert to specialized business sales or superstore formats, while an additional 1,000 will probably go out of business.
Retail consultants say the most apt model for the emergence of the PC superstore is the stereo industry. When stereo, or "hifi" as it was then called, was a specialized interest, thousands of independent stores served a mostly hobbyist market. As stereo, and later video, equipment became a must-have for most families, the mass merchandisers moved in. The independents that survived, became boutiques, selling high-end products to a small group.
"The PC industry is undergoing a change that other segments of retailing already have undergone," said Nathan Morton, president and chief executive officer of CompUSA Inc. in Dallas. "All our company really did was to put all these products in one place and behave much like the supermarket," he said. With 17 stores, CompUSA, which recently changed its name from Soft Warehouse, is the largest superstore operator.
"One of the reasons we've had the opportunity is the existing resellers have essentially abandoned the retail business," Mr. Morton said. "All the talk about retail being dead in PC's is very much untrue."
Not everyone agrees that superstores are the best answer, however. With 20,000-square-foot stores in high traffic locations, the superstore operators' fixed costs are high, and they must maintain a large inventory at all times. And most superstores, including CompUSA, are not franchised by I.B.M., Compaq or Apple, so they sell mostly clones, and clones do not build customer loyalty the way name brands do.
"It is going to be a much tougher battle for them than it is running a Circuit City," said Albert Bates, president of the Profit Planning Group, a retail consulting firm based in Boulder, Colo. Personal computers still need active selling, and the technology changes often, which can be disaster for a store sitting on a large inventory, he said.
CompUSA does offer full service, and can configure computers to meet customers' needs. In that respect it is more like the established computer resellers than the mass merchandisers.
And now the real mass merchandisers, warehouse clubs like Price Club, CostCo and Sam's, are getting into PC retailing as well. Mr. Merrin estimates that warehouse clubs, which offer no service or support, nevertheless sold more than $700 million in personal computers in 1990 and will hit $1.5 billion this year. The warehouse clubs can offer a high-powered clone, based on Intel's 486 chip, with a large capacity hard disk for $2,999 -- about 25 percent less than the name brands.
 
End of the Retailer
Instead, Direct Sales To Big Business
 The days when a customer could drive to the neighborhood Businessland or MicroAge store to look at PC's may be gone for good. The established computer resellers are closing expensive storefronts as fast as they can to focus on specialized business sales. With profit margins on PC's razor thin, they see more money to be made on service, support and the systems engineering needed to create complex networks of PC's.
"We closed our last retail store Dec. 31," said Tom Pelandini, a spokesman for Businessland in San Jose, Calif., once the largest company-owned retail computer chain. "You can no longer walk into a Businessland store and buy a computer." He sees Businessland's future in direct sales to major corporate customers. Of the superstores, he said:"We are not going to, nor can we compete with those kinds of places."
Similarly, MicroAge, based in Tempe, Ariz., has replaced its storefronts with "2,000 sales people knocking on doors," said Jeffrey McKeever, president and chief executive officer. "Retail stores got a black eye because as people began looking for more complex solutions, nobody could help them," he said. "It's impossible to clerk a store with highly knowledgeable technical people; the economics don't work."
One company that has successfully managed both ends of the market is the Tandy Corporation, based in Fort Worth, which is both a manufacturer and a retailer. Tandy sells to corporations through its Grid Centers, which are more like sales offices than stores, and sells to home and small- business users through its Radio Shack stores. Tandy computers cost more than the no-name clones, but typically offer more built-in software and other features.
"Our object is to not be just a clone," said John Roach, Tandy's chairman and chief executive officer. In addition, "there is a comfort factor in knowing we're going to be in business."
Another tack the established resellers are taking is to "unbundle" sales and service. They note that 90 percent of the $40 million in personal computer sales is to large corporations, many of which have large internal computer support staffs and are only interested in the lowest price. For businesses without internal computer staffs, they offer a range of services at a fee, from loading software to complete support.
 
Software Sellers
More Competition From Discounters
 Before there were superstores, there were software-only stores, which undercut computer dealers on price by selling in volume.
"Unfortunately for them, the superstore is primarily a software store," said Mr. Anderson. "What's happening to them is what they did to the traditional dealer channel."
But Egghead Discount Software, based in Issaquah, Wash., the largest software-only chain, has been able to return to profitability by increasing its emphasis on outside sales and continuing an emphasis on service and selection, said Matthew Griffin, Egghead's president and chief executive officer. "While we are still significantly discounted from retail we are slightly higher than the warehouses," he said. "We believe our customers will pay slightly more to have our selection and service."
 
BEATING THE CLONES ON PRICE
"The retail channel will never be the same," said Seymour Merrin, a leading PC retail consultant, referring to Compaq's across-the-board price cuts announced April 16. Responding to a raft of clones with similar features and lower price tags, Compaq slashed prices on its entire product line by as much as 34 percent.
Computer resellers have long griped that if I.B.M., Compaq and Apple had lower prices, the clone makers and warehouse stores might never have come to be. Apple introduced a new line of lower-priced Macintosh models last year, which have rapidly become its best-selling products ever. And on April 23, I.B.M. lowered prices on its models.
The result of these price drops should be a leveling of the playing field between traditional computer stores, which mostly sell the big three, and superstores, which mostly sell clones, Mr. Merrin said. Corporate buyers would rather buy from I.B.M., Compaq or Apple, but were no longer willing to pay a 30 percent price premium. Now they won't have to.
"What Compaq did -- and this is the single most conservative and deliberate company in our industry -- was not just to meet the competition but to beat the competition," Mr. Merrin said. "They are literally putting their prices below the clones. It's a guerrilla marketing tactic."
One interesting aspect of the Compaq price cut is that the actual price cut to the dealer was not nearly as large as the drop in the suggested retail price. This means that Compaq's own profit margins will suffer little, but it also means that the gap between what the dealer pays and what the customer pays has narrowed. That should make picking Compaq over a clone an easier choice.
Surprisingly, dealers do not mind the apparent shrinkage of their profit margin; this is because most of them were giving it away in discounts to customers anyway, and they believe the lower suggested retail price will bring in added sales. "It was all vapor margin anyway," said Computerland's Ed Anderson. "The truth is that in most major markets, hardware margins were really only 15 to 18 percent."

HEADLINE: Why Salvadorans Flock to the Island

 BODY:
I must take issue with some of the economic and political implications of the article "Illegal Aliens Say Census Missed Thousands" [March 24, 1991]. The tone of the article suggests that most Salvadorans are here in this country because of political repression back in El Salvador and that they held the U.S. responsible.
One illegal refugee was quoted as saying, "It's hard to reach people on Long Island. . . . North Americans are cold to the suffering of our people."
The fact is, it must be hard to reach Salvadorans about the conditions of their country, too, because in election after election they keep electing the right-wing Arena Party, which is associated with death-squad activity.
In fact the United States has pursued a policy in El Salvador of political moderation that many Salvadoran people find soft on communism. That's why the Christian Democrats and Jose Napoleon Duarte were resoundingly turned out of office several years ago and why the Arena Party won another resounding victory this last month.
I was in El Salvador when Reagan won the election back in '84, and the people were jubilant, so afraid most of them were that Mondale was going to discontinue military aid.
All my Salvadoran in-laws who have come to this country hate communists with a passion that even the staunchest American conservative would admire. They all vote for Arena, and every one of them is here for economic, not political reasons. Their objective in the United States is simple. They want to make money.
Other than one college educated refugee I've spoken with and the people at the Central American Refugee Center, I've never met a Salvadoran who expressed the slightest shred of support for the guerrilla movement. They hold the guerrillas responsible for the social, political and economic turmoil of their country.
The article also suggests that Salvadorans have been exploited on Long Island. Considering their lack of economic resources, marketable skills and, often, the ability to speak English, they've done pretty well. Long Islanders should not be held responsible for the conditions under which poor Salvadorans must live because these people have come on their own. Long Island has enough "home-grown" poverty.
I suggest that liberal theologians and refugee organizations educate the Salvadoran people, not North Americans, about conditions in El Salvador. Most Salvadorans are remarkably misinformed, ignorant or indifferent to the roots of their country's present turmoil.
The fact that Salvadorans overwhelmingly re-elect right-wing leaders linked to death-squad activity underscores this point. And of the many Salvadorans I know who are seeking "political amnesty" or refugee status, not one would support even the moderate Christian Democrats over the conservative Arena Party.
These people use the political-amnesty claim because they know it is often the only way they can gain legal entry into this country. I know Salvadorans who while benefitting from amnesty workers and liberal religious groups here denounce what they call "liberation ideology" back home as meddlesome and sympathetic to Communists.
The massive influx of Salvadorans to the United States -- many of whom are indeed uncounted -- is a result of overpopulation, chronic poverty exacerbated by the revolution of rising expectations wrought by United States influence and, finally, the Civil War of the last 10 years. Most Salvadorans see the Communist-led insurgency and the Civil War as a cause, not as a result of the many problems that beset the country.
Journalists and refugee organizations are right in underscoring the chronic injustices of Salvadoran society, and wrong in leading North Americans to believe that the Salvadoran people at large share this concern. For most Salvadorans the concern is to make a living in a stable economic and political atmosphere.

HEADLINE: Vietnamese Streaming Into Hong Kong

BYLINE: By BARBARA BASLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HONG KONG, May 11

 BODY:
Ignoring constant warnings carried by Vietnamese radio and television about the bleak reception awaiting them here, Vietnamese boat people are once again sailing to Hong Kong in large numbers.
More than 800 arrived in the first week of May alone, 378 of them in eight boats on Tuesday -- the highest one-day total in nearly two years. Hong Kong Government officials say more than 4,500 Vietnamese have arrived so far this year, compared with only 6,400 who came in all of 1990, prompting fears that this British colony may face a crisis like the one in in 1989, when 34,000 Vietnamese fled here.
 
Officials Are Concerned
 Clinton Leeks, the Government's refugee coordinator, said that even though spring and summer are traditionally the most popular times for the Vietnamese to come, the big jump in arrivals compared with last season is "what is troubling us most." 
 Mr. Leeks said the Government once believed the high numbers of boat people who arrived in 1989 were "an aberration, but now we believe that the low numbers of 1990 were the aberration. We think the whole thing may start up once again."
He attributed the low number of arrivals last year to the forced repatriation of 51 Vietnamese in December 1989. The forced return of the boat people was condemned by countries around the world, including the United States, and an embarrassed Vietnam, desperately seeking foreign aid and investment, has refused to accept any more such returns.
 
Talks With U.S. Officials
 Mr. Leeks said Hong Kong and Britain this month hoped to discuss the Vietnamese problem here with American officials, who have opposed forced repatriation of boat people.
Vietnamese have been locked in detention camps here since 1988, when the Hong Kong Government said it would no longer treat all boat people as refugees, who are accorded special protection under international law, but instead as illegal immigrants.
Since then all new arrivals have been taken to closed camps, where they must wait to be screened by immigration officers who decide whether they are refugees eligible for resettlement, or illegal immigrants who will eventually be sent home.
Government officials here say that most of the Vietnamese have left for economic reasons, an assertion disputed by many humanitarian groups.
Relief workers say conditions in the colony's 10 detention camps, which already house 47,300 Vietnamese -- the largest population of boat people in Southeast Asia -- are tense.
 
'Violence and Unrest'
 "You have thousands of men and women locked up, facing uncertain, almost hopeless futures, and that breeds violence and unrest," said a relief worker.
On Thursday, fighting broke out between rival factions of Vietnamese at the Hei Ling Chau camp, leaving 42 people injured, 2 of them seriously, camp officials said.
About 350 additional correction officers were called in to conduct a weapons search, which yielded 419 homemade weapons. On Friday, the colony's legislative leaders said no matter how large the influx, they would refuse to vote money for any new camps.
One legislator said that Hong Kong's "humanitarian" treatment of the Vietnamese "attracts them to come here." But Suzy Comerford, chairman of Hong Kong Refugee Concern, an umbrella group of relief agencies, said: "Hong Kong has had a harsh system of detention that was supposed to deter the boat people and it hasn't. It ought to be clear by now that deterrence as a policy doesn't work."
"We've been interviewing these arrivals to find out what has triggered this new stream of migrants, and really the reasons they are leaving Vietnam now are no different from the reasons they left in the past," said Mr. Leeks. "They are poor, and they hope to find a better life."
Of the 47,300 in the camps, a government official said, 30,509 are still awaiting screening, while almost 17,000 have already been screened out. An additional 6,700 Vietnamese are classified as refugees and live in open camps while they await resettlement.

HEADLINE: Chief Executives See Recession Lingering to 1992

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOT SPRING, Va., May 11

 BODY:
Differing markedly from the view of most economists, the people who run the nation's biggest companies say the recession is likely to linger for many more months, with a recovery not likely until next year.
"There's no sign of recovery -- none at all," declared Henry B. Schacht, chairman of the Cummins Engine Company, a leading producer of such cyclical bellwethers as diesel engines. "The people who buy industrial equipment are not buying it." 
 One after another, individual corporate chiefs among about 100 members of the Business Council who have been meeting here, expressed skepticism in interviews and discussions over the past two days about the recession's ending this summer, thus staying within the average length of the eight previous post-war recessions.
The lack of optimism among the all-male membership of the Business Council, a club-like organization of America's business elite that gathers at the plush red brick Homestead Hotel each May and October, contrasts with the council's own economic consultants, who are still predicting an end of the recession this summer. "We do not see an upturn in the economy until the fourth quarter," said Walter V. Shipley, chairman of the Chemical Banking Corporation.
 
Top Executives in Accord
 "Flat," said Harold A. Poling of the Ford Motor Company, normally an early participant in business recoveries. Their comments were echoed by the top people at such giants as General Electric, Xerox and TRW.
A 20-member panel of economic advisers to the Business Council, many of whom work for companies whose chief executives were gathered here, continues to hold the common view that the recession will be over by midyear. Of the panel members, 6 contend the economy began to recover in the first quarter, 10 hold that recovery will occur during the April-June period and the remaining 4 predict a recovery by the end of September.
In its formal report, the panel predicted a decline in the gross national product of 1.2 percent from the economy's peak last July, about half the magnitude of post-war recessions.
"Favorable factors in the outlook continue to be the absence of a large and widespread overhang of inventories which sharply depressed production in past recessions, rising demand for exports and, most important, the easing of monetary policy under way since last fall," said the technical advisers, who forged their views at a meeting April 30.
This morning, Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, participated in a closed discussion of the chief executives on the outlook for economy. But he gave little hint as to whether the central bank was inclined to begin another round of interest-rate cuts to help turn the economy around.
A meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets the central bank's monetary policy, is scheduled for Tuesday.
 
Greenspan Sees Low Point

Business executives made it clear to Mr. Greenspan that they desired further lowering of interest rates. But Mr. Greenspan indicated he thought the economy was already nearing its low point, participants at the meeting said.
 There would be very little inflation risk if the rates were lowered, said John F. Welch Jr., chairman of General Electric.
The divergence of views between the professional economists and the chief executives appeared somewhat ominous since the economists proved overly optimistic last fall when only 5 of 19 thought a recession had begun by Oct. 1. As it turned out, the recession had actually begun in July, the National Bureau of Economic Research determined late last month.
A recovery could come this summer, as the economists predict, suggested George M. C. Fisher, chairman of Motorola Inc. but he added, "I wouldn't want to bet on it. I wouldn't be surprised to see a pickup delayed" to year's end.

HEADLINE: How Best to Teach the Blind: A Growing Battle Over Braille

BYLINE: By KAREN DE WITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 10

 BODY:
Kenneth Silberman was in graduate school when he realized he had to learn to read and write.
Mr. Silberman, who is blind, discovered that the tape recorders and computers he had always used to get through school were little help in the studies required to earn a master's degree. 
 He ended up teaching himself Braille and received the degree, in aerospace engineering, from Cornell University. But he is still bitter that as a child with only limited vision he was not taught Braille and thus found himself illiterate in his mid-20's.
Mr. Silberman's predicament is not unusual. Braille, once taught to all the visually handicapped, has been partly supplanted in the last 40 years by such technological aids as tape recorders, voice-activated computers and machines that translate print into voice. As a result, illiteracy is on the rise among the nation's 13 million people with visual handicaps. The most recent figures available, from the American Printing House for the Blind, show that in 1989, only 12 percent of visually handicapped students read Braille, down from nearly 50 percent in 1965.
 
How Militant an Approach?
 The illiteracy rate is at the center of a battle over whether the best approach is technology and some Braille, or a wholesale return to Braille. The conflict pits advocacy groups dominated by those without visual handicaps against more militant groups dominated by the blind.
Those without visual handicaps want to teach Braille selectively. They say the other aids have a valid place and that the pool of visually handicapped people includes those with other disabilities, like mental retardation or tactile insensitivity, that would preclude them from learning Braille.
But the groups dominated by the blind argue that Braille should be mandatory for any visually handicapped person who is able to learn it.
Both sides agree on the stakes: whether more people with visual handicaps will become independent, productive members of society, or whether they will remain largely on the fringe. Seventy percent of the visually impaired who are of employment age are either unemployed or underemployed, according to Susan Spungin, associate executive director of the American Foundation for the Blind.
 
How the Groups Differ
 Dr. Spungin's group is run generally by people without visual handicaps. By contrast, the more militant National Federation of the Blind is dominated by those with visual handicaps. Still another group, the American Council of the Blind, is similar in philosophy to Dr. Spungin's and is run by both handicapped and non-handicapped people.
The struggle between those who would require Braille to be taught and those who argue that it should be taught only when necessary has gathered force since the passage last year of the Americans with Disabilities Act. The law prohibits discrimination against people with physical and mental impairments. It would, for example, require restaurants to assist blind customers by providing Braille menus or having a waiter read selections.
The tension over the teaching of Braille grows out of changes in education. Historically, all people with vision handicaps have been taught Braille in separate schools for the blind. But in the 1950's and 1960's, there was a shift toward integrating these students into public schools and encouraging them to use whatever vision they had.
 
The Degree of Handicaps
 Mr. Silberman, a 30-year-old administrator at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., is among those who entered school in that period, just as technology like tape recorders, computers and machines that translate print into voice were becoming cheap enough for classroom use. The technology was considered a boon to those with visual handicaps, particularly people with "low vision," like Mr. Silberman. The feeling among some was that Braille was obsolete.
A person classified as visually impaired is one who has only limited sight and requires specialized care from an eye doctor. A legally blind person is one whose peripheral vision is reduced to 20 percent or who can see only the top "E" on the optical examination chart with the better corrected eye.
For Mr. Silberman and groups like the National Federation of the Blind, Braille is the solution not only to illiteracy but to dependency.
"There are a lot of blind people who can't take advantage of better employment opportunity simply because they can't use written words with facility," said Marc Maurer, president of the federation. "It isn't that we're oppposed to technology. Technology has enhanced Braille, has made it cheaper, made it more accessible and opened up more jobs for those who are blind."
 
Resistance From Parents
 But Dr. Richard Welsh of the Greater Pittsburgh Guild for the Blind disagreed. "Braille is a good medium for some students, but it's not the answer for every student," said Dr. Welsh, a former superintendent of a school for the blind in Maryland who opposed a bill two years ago that would have required the teaching of Braille.
The federation, whose headquarters are in in Baltimore, is demanding that Braille be taught to every legally blind person and is pushing for passage of Braille bills in state legislatures. Laws requiring that legally blind students be taught Braille are now in force in five states. Similar legislation is being considered in several other states.
Dick Edlung, a Democratic State Represenative, sponsored the Braille law that Kansas recently passed. "There was some resistance from teachers, but the major resistance to mandating that kids learn Braille was from the parents," said Mr. Edlung, who is legally blind. "A lot of parents don't want to have a blind kid."
Adapted in the early 19th century by a blind Frenchman, Louis Braille, from a code invented by another Frenchman, Charles Barbier, Braille is a system of six raised dots in 63 combinations representing letters and words that can be read by touching.
 
Aprons Over the Dots
 Opponents of mandatory Braille argue that it is inappropriate for some visually impaired people. They recall a period earlier in the century when students at schools for the blind who had some vision were forced to wear aprons to cover the Braille on their desks because they could see the dots.
"If you can read white dots on white paper with your eyes, then it is probably not appropriate to learn Braille," said Dr. Spungin of the American Foundation for the Blind.
But Mr. Silberman says even partly sighted people should learn Braille.
By the time he was studying astronomy at the University of Pennsylvania, Mr. Silberman said, "I was doing a lot of stuff with taped material, but have you ever tried to look for a specific piece of information on a cassette?" He said he tried to memorize everything, but "the work was getting steadily more sophisticated and I really struggled."
He won a scholarship from the National Federation of the Blind in 1985 and met other blind professionals who helped restore his self-confidence. As a result, he tackled the study of Braille. Mr. Silberman said that has made the difference between living on Social Security and food stamps and having a good job.
Dr. Spungin said the American Foundation for the Blind and the American Council of the Blind favor the use of Braille but object to legislation requiring it for all visually impaired people.
 
Labels for Disabilities
 She said a 1975 Federal law requires that special education students, including those with reduced vision, be given individual education plans, and that such plans can include Braille if parents and teachers think it necessary.
Like some other experts, she explains part of the increase in blind illiteracy by noting that medical advances have made it possible for more children today to survive with multiple disabilities, including impaired vision. But she said that many children are labeled visually impaired when they actually have multiple handicaps and will never be able to learn Braille.
Noreen Rysticken, a Baltimore speech and language pathologist and the mother of a multiply-impaired daughter, opposed the Maryland Braille bill.
"My daughter, Diane, has some functional vision, but she's also very delayed because of hearing impairments and cystic fibrosis," said Ms. Rysticken. "To force teachers to teach her Braille, would cause emotional problems. Braille is a reading system. She'll never read very much."

HEADLINE: For New Yorkers,Something Is Gone With Budget

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY

 BODY:
To the people who live in New York City, there is nothing abstract about the fiscal crisis anymore. Experts prescribe and politicians spar, but New Yorkers look past them at the city. What they see is loss.
They see the city budget through the prism of their own lives and jobs, fears and urban pleasures. Regardless of what happens in the coming weeks in the corridors and conference rooms of City Hall, many on the outside speak of a shared sense that New York City will never be quite the same again. 
 "I don't think that it will ever come back," said Stephen Bohannon, a 36-year-old video producer who lives with his wife and 5-month-old daughter in the Park Slope section of Brooklyn.
Mr. Bohannon was talking of the services he expected the government to cut. He was also referring to the economic boom, excitement, and confidence that drew him to New York in 1977 from the Midwest. "It's not that glittering place anymore."
The telling sign of a city's deterioration is in the eye of each beholder. To Llewellyn Lennon, 36, a Jamaican-born architectural designer, the crisis is one of unemployment. He has been out of work for 18 months. "If something doesn't break soon," he said, "I will have to drive a cab in a few weeks." A cleaning woman from the Caribbean, who would give her name only as Marre, said she feared walking down darkened streets of Flatbush, certain that the bad crime in her Brooklyn neighborhood would only get worse.
And Jacob Levich, a 31-year-old paralegal who lives in Manhattan and who spent the last four months hunting for his current job, said he saw decline most acutely in the simple luxuries of New York -- the parks he expected to be neglected and the libraries he expected to close. "Parks and libraries," Mr. Levich said, "provide the difference between an acceptable and utterly dismal existence."
Almost all the people who were interviewed last week spoke of danger, predicting that suffering caused by cuts in social services, employment and drug treatment would unleash class rage.
And many who heard the details of Mayor David N. Dinkins's doomsday budget proposals thought they smelled a bluff. They laughed dismissively at the notion that the city would really be forced to drain public swimming pools, turn off street lights or close the recently renovated Central Park Zoo. "It will probably cost just as much to remove the animals from their cages," said Neddi Heller, a painter and art teacher in Brooklyn.
Yet those same New Yorkers who were confident that not all the threatened service cuts would come to pass also gloomily predicted that those that were cut would probably never be restored. "Once services are gone, you can't bring them back," said Michele Krauthamer, 36, a teacher at a private school who is married to Mr. Bohannon. "Once people do without, they just keep doing without."
And few expect that the pain to be meted out by City Hall in the coming weeks will be remotely even. Most say they expect that those who will suffer most in the years of government's doing less will be those who already have little reason to rejoice about conditions in the city.
 
'People Will Be at Odds'
 This time, however, many predicted that even the well-off would not be entirely spared. "The lower down you are on the social scale the more these cuts hurt," Mr. Levich said, "but in the long run, even the well-to-do will be bothered. People will be at odds with each other."
The notion that greater unemployment, poverty, and crime would further pit the poor against the rich was widely shared. Mr. Bohannan put it this way: "The Mayor said that those who receive should also give something back, but for those who had it taken away, they are going to give some grief."
Not everyone was despairing -- but even the optimists worried that others would. "People are getting ready to retire and move," said Curtis Payadue, 66, an electrician from Cambria Heights, Queens. "I wish I could stay until I die, right here in New York, because I love the city."
Mr. Payadue said he was deeply troubled by how less-resilient New Yorkers would respond to higher taxes and service cuts. "You're going to knock the morale down," he said. "They're going to lose the spirit and you're going to lose those people doing things for the city, and we can't just cut our kids out and throw them to the dogs."
 
'I Don't Care How Bad It Is'
 Mr. Payadue had a warning for City Hall. "My advice to the Mayor would be, realize that certain things you cannot cut out," he said. "I don't care how bad it is, we have to have those things. They're talking about cutting the sanitation -- No, we need the streets clean. For appearance, for the morale of the city, you need to do things so that people can feel that you are trying, that you are saying, 'It's rough and tough but we're trying to weather those things.' "
There were those who expected their neighbors to pull together in adversity, and didn't scoff at the Mayor's plea for team spirit and volunteerism.
"I've seen more and more people really reaching out," said Durriyya Abdullah, an administrator at the Hudson Guild, a community center on 26th Street in Chelsea. "Last night I brought more than I could carry from the supermarket. When I came to a traffic light, I put my bags down to rest my arms. A woman I didn't know said, 'How far are you going? I'll walk with you.' "
"We cannot think that our backs are against the wall," Ms. Abdullah added. "True, our basic needs are being threatened. But we can assist in a very direct manner. There are people -- our neighbors, people we see -- who have a need, who we could help."
Her optimism, however, was not shared by Anthony J. Marra, a 48-year old municipal employee and lifelong resident of Staten Island. "There's no sense of community here," Mr. Marra said. "People are afraid to walk the streets. They don't know their neighbors. How can you expect them to want to help each other?"
Frustration over the city's straits quickly turns to anger at its leaders. "If I had been younger, I would have been part of the protest at Hunter over the tuition hike," said Ms. Heller, who is in her 30's. "It's miserable how the politicians have taken this education system and and taken away financial aid from students who really need to finish their education." She added a lament that was echoed by many others. "The wrong people are being taxed: the poor and the middle class."
Ms. Krauthamer worried about what was being done with her tax dollars. "I think there is a lot of corruption and money wasted unnecessarily," she said, adding that she saw it most clearly along the Eastern Parkway, whose restoration was stalled last year after the contractor filed for bankruptcy. "I think the city could be more careful who they do business with."
 
Call Seems Hollow to Some
 The call for sacrifice from City Hall also rang hollow to Mr. Lennon, who said he had seen little on the part of elected officials. "The City Council won't even take a cut in pay for their part-time jobs, which makes me feel like there is money out there and people don't want to do their share." He added, "Management doesn't want to bite the bullet, in my opinion."
Jean Alexander, a single mother from Trinidad, suggested that organized labor could also pitch in. "I think the union people should at least listen to the Mayor and understand and not ask for raises."
Ms. Alexander, who runs a social service agency for Caribbean immigrants in Coney Island, knows first-hand that there are places in far worse shape than New York City.
"Some people only look at the bad sides of things," she said. "If it were only bad, why would people be coming here from the Caribbean and all over the world?"
 
Beacon With Less Luster
 "But," Ms. Alexander added quietly, "now is not a good time to be migrating, because migrants expect that things are going to be better here and they're going to find a job, but that's not happening now. There aren't that many jobs out there now."
Despite all its financial troubles, New York City remains a beacon for the least fortunate of the third world, but it has lost some of its luster for other traditional immigrants. Take the Greenwich Village artist.
John Zinsser, 30, is an abstract painter who lives in the East Village and works in a studio in TriBeCa. He stated, "I do feel that New York is still the important art city, because of the peer group and intellectual support community." But Mr. Zinsser said he could not afford to ignore the city's weakened condition. "I've had a show in L.A." he said, "That eased my thinking, that New York isn't all there is."

GRAPHIC: Photos: "I wish I could stay until I die, right here in New York, because I love the city," said Curtis Payadue, left. With him at his home in Queens were his wife, Jacqueline, his niece, Trincia Payadue, and his son, Marcus (Jim Estrin for The New York Times); "We cannot think that our backs are against the wall," said Durriyya Abdullah, who lives and works in Chelsea. "True, our basic needs are being threatened. But we can assist in a very direct manner." (Bill Swersey for The New York Times) (pg. 22)

HEADLINE: Mexico City's Toxic Residue Worsens Already Filthy Air

BYLINE: By MARK A. UHLIG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ECATEPEC, Mexico, May 10

 BODY:
Whether the weather is cold or hot, one thing is usually certain in this northern Mexico City suburb: it snows.
Snow, at least, is the word that residents use for the fine white powder that blankets their streets and houses every morning. And it is a fitting description for what scientists say is a lingering cloud of wind-borne chemicals, raised from a giant caustic-soda plant beyond the horizon, that hangs above the working-class neighborhood.
"It even kills the trees," said Pedro Quesadas Herrera, a 40-year-old accountant, pointing to lifeless shrubs on the block where he lives with his wife and four daughters. "There's no way to get away from it."
 
Skin and Respiratory Ailments
 Amid the bare concrete houses and flat, rubble-strewn fields of Ecatepec, many adults and children have developed respiratory problems, and dozens bear large patches of rough, discolored skin on their faces and arms. The neighborhood air is so foul with sharp, industrial odors that it burns a visitor's eyes and throat.
Yet by Mexico City standards, Ecatepec's toxic snowfall is just one symptom of a deepening environmental crisis that has left the Mexican capital with the most polluted air of any major metropolitan area in the world.
Trapped by unfavorable geography and explosive population growth, Mexico City has what scientists say is an unequaled collection of atmospheric poisons. It is overwhelmed by industrial emissions, smoke, vehicle exhaust and human waste.
Saturated with contaminants, the grey-brown blanket of pollution that covers the Mexico City valley now routinely exceeds -- by as much as four times -- the maximum exposure limits established by the World Health Organization. Infectious diseases like salmonella and hepatitis can be contracted simply by inhaling bacteria suspended in the air. And doctors say that even mild outdoor exercise, like jogging, has now become a calculated risk.
As pollution problems have worsened, the Mexican Government, pushed by Mexico City's Mayor, Manuel Camacho Solis, has adopted increasingly stringent measures to force reduction in harmful emissions. Since late 1989, every automobile in the city has been required to remain idle one business day a week. This winter, the authorities banned traffic in 50 square blocks around the central plaza, Zocalo, and have begun shutting down dozens of industries for violating pollution laws.
Those efforts have been redoubled as environmental concerns have become central to the proposed free trade agreement grouping Mexico, the United States and Canada. Last fall, the Mexican Government announced a $2.5-billion, four-year plan to rescue the capital's air quality. In March, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari ordered the shutdown of the city's giant state-run oil refinery.
Despite such measures, daily concentrations of pollutants like ozone and nitrogen dioxide have continued to rise. In 1990, Mexico City exceeded maximum ozone limits four out of every five days of the year -- more than twice the level of Los Angeles.
Until now, renewed economic expansion has canceled out the hard-won gains of mandatory conservation programs, and well-intended decrees have been emasculated by lax or corrupt enforcement. But as Mexico City has labored through the worst season of contaminated air in its history, Government officials and environmental groups agree that the struggle against pollution has become a high-stakes battle for the city's survival.
"The citizen of Mexico City gets up every morning and the first thing he confronts is the pollution," said Homero Aridjis of the Group of 100, a group of writers and artists that has taken a leading role in anti-pollution efforts. "There is a contaminant for every hour, every activity. It has reached the level of an ecological catastrophe."
 
Tons of Foul Dust, A River of Sludge
 It takes just a glance from a high-flying aircraft to understand the causes of Mexico City's pollution crisis, which is defined, like the city itself, by a semicircle of volcano peaks that reach as high as 16,900 feet. "It is like a giant cup or bowl that is open only to the north, where the prevailing winds come from," an American scientist said. "So it acts like a catch basin, collecting every fume."
Carpeting the broad Mexico City valley is a seemingly endless sprawl of urban industries and ramshackle neighborhoods that have pushed the valley's population from 5 million to roughly 16 million in the last 40 years. That growth has made greater Mexico City the largest metropolitan area in the world, filling the valley with 2.8 million vehicles and tens of thousands of poorly regulated businesses -- from cement factories to public baths -- that foul the air with furnaces, incinerators, spray paint, solvents and open-air chemical stockpiles. They release a total of 4.35 million tons of pollutants into the city's atmosphere every year, Government statistics say.
The effect of those emissions is compounded by the city's high elevation, 7,280 feet above sea level. It reduces by 23 percent the oxygen needed for breathing and effective burning of fuel.
In the vast areas covered by urban squatters, where latrines and sewers are often nonexistent, that dust carries with it tons of dried fecal matter. A confidential United Nations study conducted in 1989 said that about 30 percent of Mexico City residents have no sewerage service, and their solid waste, deposited in open areas, contributes about 600 tons of fecal dust to the city's pollution each day.
Even where sewage is channeled into rivers or other means of disposal, it often remains exposed above ground, where it is carried into the air as gases or microscopic particles.
By the time it crosses north-central Mexico City, one such river, the Rio de los Remedios, appears to be less a body of water than a thick, venomous stream of black sludge. On the surface, the foul-smelling river shines with rainbow-colored slicks of oil and industrial discharges. But organic processes from untreated waste causes the river to release bubbles of gas from within, making it appear to boil as it slowly works its way across the city.
Once released into the air, scientists say, the chemical and bacterial pollutants are pressed down by early-morning inversions of hot air. Ground winds and local temperature variations then insure that the pollution becomes an equal opportunity affliction -- choking rich and poor neighbhorhoods alike.
 
Pollution and Illness: The Links Are Clear
 Trying to calm public fear about rising pollution levels, national officials have repeatedly asserted that there is no proven link between pollution and medical problems in otherwise healthy adults.
But years of studies in other polluted cities like Los Angeles and Tokyo have demonstrated the adverse health effects of such individual pollutants as ozone and nitrogen dioxide -- everything from skin reactions and eye irritation to weakness, lung disorders and increased susceptibility to heart attacks.
There is even less doubt about the health implications of the micro-organisms carried in Mexico City's fecal dust. Among the infectious ones identified in the 1989 United Nations study were salmonella, streptococcus, staphylococcus, shigella and amoeba.
Having found no Government answers to their patients' pollution concerns, doctors at one of Mexico City's leading private medical centers, the American British Cowdray Hospital, have pushed ahead with their own studies of lead and other contaminants, and are raising money to construct their own pollution monitoring station on hospital grounds.
Other physicians who deal regularly with large numbers of poor and working class patients have been more outspoken in their assessment of the city's environmental crisis. Dr. Juan Ortiz Feijoo, director of a state-administered hospital that serves more than 400,000 patients in north-central Mexico City, estimated that his staff has seen a doubling of cases of bronchitis and other respiratory ailments this year alone.
Similar increases, he said, have been noted for conjunctivitis and other eye disorders, with the most acute problems among children, the elderly and patients with existing illnesses.
Such statistics have been more than enough to sway many officials of private institutions, particularly those responsible for children. The superintendent of the American School, one of Mexico City's most prestigious preparatory academies, Fred J. Pasquale, explained why parents and teachers decided early in March to cancel all outdoor sports for the school's 2,300 students.
"The question was whether vigorous exercise is beneficial in Mexico City," Mr. Pasquale said. "The conclusion was that it is not." School officials are now studying the possibility of building a new sealed recreation area with filtered air for grade-schoolers.
Embassies and corporations have reached similar judgments about the pollution crisis, renting houses outside the capital for their staffs, and advising diplomats' families not to have babies while stationed here. While applauding the Government's anti-pollution efforts, the United States pays its diplomats a 10 percent hardship premium for enduring the city's air.
Converting medical concerns into free publicity, one small group, the Mexican Ecological Movement, has repeatedly drawn headlines by asserting its intention to install pay-per-breath oxygen booths across the city.
 
Lax Enforcement Obstructs Progress
 When he took office in December 1988, President Salinas declared the job of cleaning up Mexico City's air to be one of his principal objectives.
In 28 months, the Government has pushed through dozens of strict measures, including the nationwide introduction of unleaded gasoline, the replacement of more than 3,500 smoke-belching city buses, and the mandatory changeover of at least 94 major industries to low-sulfur fuels.
Those measures, officials say, have already reversed the growth of the two most dangerous pollutants, lead and sulfur dioxide. But peak measurements of harmful particles suspended in the Mexico City air have reached record levels, and other pollutants like carbon monoxide have, after drastic sacrifices, merely been held constant.
Even efforts like unleaded gasoline, which still accounts for only 3 percent of all gasoline burned in the city, have yet to prove their worth as long-term solutions. Other gains, like sewer-extension projects, have quickly become a perpetual race against the city's continued growth. Since the restrictions on car use were imposed, more than 275,000 additional cars have been registered in the city, as many as 10 percent of them purchased specifically to avoid the restrictions.
Above all, there is no clear indication that the Government has the means or the will to enforce its ambitious pollution standards.
On a recent day in the southeast Mexico City suburb of Iztapaluca, makers of a traditional clay brick known as tabique worked unmolested fueling the crude, house-sized furnaces that they have used for centuries to bake their wares.
A common fuel for the outdoor furnaces, which are designed to produce fierce, sustained heat, is sawdust soaked in fuel oil. But the local preference is for old rubber tires, which are cheaper and generate a powerful, virtually unextinguishable blaze that lasts for days. Both fuels send up billows of acrid black smoke that blanket the neighborhood and are visible for miles.
Asked about such flagrant environmental abuse, Government officials said that the brick factories are difficult to find or close because they operate clandestinely and move frequently from place to place.
But members of some of the 350 families that jointly operate more than a dozen furnaces in Iztapaluca said they have worked and lived in the same spot for at least 30 years. Their location is readily discovered by following the columns of smoke on the horizon.
Whether and how soon the Government can begin to address such glaring problems and improve its enforcement record is unclear. But there is little doubt what the costs of failure will be.
"They have to do something," said Silvia Salmeron Rodriguez, a 33-year-old mother who lives in Ecatepec with her seven children. "The air sticks to you, it chokes you, it burns your children. Nobody can live this way for long."

HEADLINE: States Using Donations to Get Medicaid Money

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON, May 11 --
Faced with soaring medical costs, states have devised a way to extract money from the Federal Government to pay for health care of poor people under Medicaid.
Bush Administration officials say the fund-raising technique is a scam that costs the Government more than a billion dollars a year, and they are trying to halt its use. But state officials say it is a legitimate way to finance expanded medical care for millions of women and children in low-income families mandated under recently passed Federal laws -- at no cost to state treasuries. 
 The device works this way: States collect "voluntary donations" from hospitals, count these contributions as part of the state share of Medicaid and then get $2 or $3 of Federal matching money for each dollar donated by the hospitals. Hospitals go along with the arrangement because when the Medicaid funds are paid out, they usually get back more money than they donated.
 
A Way to Pay Rising Costs
 Today, as for the last 25 years, general revenues are the main source of state Medicaid funds. But the hospital contributions have become increasingly important as states try to cope with the program's soaring costs in the midst of a recession that has depleted their revenues.
 Those donations and the related Federal payments finance health care for many pregnant women, new mothers and infants enrolled in Medicaid. Even though the Bush Administration says it wants to reduce infant mortality, it has drafted rules to end Federal matching payments for donations.
"Without these options, there is no doubt that the Medicaid program in Tennessee, after making great progress in recent years, would be forced to reduce benefits and services," said Norman B. Urmy, executive director of the Vanderbilt University Hospital in Nashville. Officials in other states expressed identical concerns.
Although Administration officials describe the hospital donations as a device invented by states to siphon money from the Federal Treasury, Federal courts have upheld the legitimacy of the technique, and Congress has explicitly allowed it to continue.
 
In Lieu of New Taxes
 Senator Wyche Fowler Jr., Democrat of Georgia, said states must be allowed to use "creative methods of financing Medicaid in these tough budget times, when health-care costs are skyrocketing and the Federal Government keeps setting new mandates" for the program. "I would much rather see a system of voluntary contributions from hospitals than the tax increases that might otherwise be needed," he said.
The fiscal condition of states is worse than at any time in the last decade, says the National Governors' Association. But state officials are reluctant to raise taxes, reading last year's election results as an overwhelming vote against new broad-based taxes.
Senator Bob Graham, Democrat of Florida, warned that "states will have to cut already insufficient benefits and reimbursement" if the Administration succeeds in restricting the use of donations and special assessments from hospitals.
A nationwide survey shows that eight states already accept donations from hospitals, for the specific purpose of getting more money from Washington for Medicaid, and 12 other states are considering such programs. A similar device -- a special state assessment on hospitals, used to get more Federal dollars for Medicaid -- has been adopted in nine states and is under consideration in 13 more.
 
Federal Objections
 The Department of Health and Human Services and the White House Office of Management and Budget object to both arrangements, saying they "unfairly increase the Federal share of Medicaid payments," distort the "Federal-state financial partnership" and permit states to finance expansion of Medicaid "with 100 percent Federal monies."
But state officials say the Administration's proposal to stop matching the hospital donations would violate the principle of federalism and usurp their authority to decide how best to raise money.
Nationwide, Medicaid finances health care for 27 million Americans, including 13 million children. States together pay about 45 percent of the program's total cost of more than $90 billion this year. The state share rises with a state's per capita income and ranges from 20 percent in the poorest state, Mississippi, to 50 percent in the most affluent states.
Georgia uses $35.5 million of hospital contributions to get $57 million from the Federal Government. Russell B. Toal, the state Medicaid director, said, "We are using the money for precisely the kinds of services that Congress and the Administration want: expanded eligibility for children, case management of prenatal care, home visits to new mothers and payments to hospitals that carry the burden of indigent care."
 
Helping Themselves by Donating
 While initially skeptical, hospital executives have come to appreciate the value of donating. W. Hoke Kerns, president of the Alabama Hospital Association, said: "Being able to generate additional revenue through voluntary contributions has enabled some of our rural hospitals to remain open. Otherwise they would have to close their doors because there is insufficient revenue to keep them open."
In Alabama this year, 24 hospitals are contributing $108 million to the state, which uses that money to obtain $288 million from the Federal Government. The state distributes the entire sum, $396 million, to hospitals, favoring those with disproportionately large numbers of low-income patients.
"We contribute to our own well-being," said Terry J. Smith, administrator of Bibb Medical Center, a 35-bed hospital in Centreville, Ala., that donates $8,000 a month to the state and gets back $16,000 a month for a net gain of $8,000.
Manly E. White, acting administrator of the Perry County Hospital and Nursing Home in Marion, Ala., said the voluntary contributions program was "a godsend" for many health-care providers. "It makes the difference between surviving and not surviving," he said.
 
How Transactions Work
 When hospitals donate to a state, they typically take the money from their general operating revenues. The donations are not just paper transactions; hospitals make actual cash contributions. While there may be a lag at first, the hospitals are eventually paid by state Medicaid programs at regular monthly or quarterly intervals.
While there is no legal limit on the donation amounts, hospital executives and members of Congress agree that donations should not exceed 10 percent of a hospital's gross revenues or 10 percent of a state's Medicaid spending.
States discovered the value of this fund-raising technique when they found that they had too little money to pay their share of Medicaid costs, creating a backlog of unpaid claims.
Missouri is using $88 million in donated funds to obtain more than $131 million from the Federal Government. "In light of the multiple Federal mandates placed on state Medicaid programs in the last few years, I have every right to be as creative as I can in paying for the program," said Donna E. Checkett, director of Missouri's Medicaid program.
In California, Sally Lee, chief of Medicaid operations, said the state had raised $147 million in voluntary contributions from hospitals and had obtained an equal amount in Federal matching funds. The money, she said, "keeps hospitals in business and improves access to medical care for the indigent."
 
Paying the State's Share
 In some states, hospitals contribute to Medicaid by paying part of the salaries of state or county employees who certify people as eligible for Medicaid. Salaries are considered an administrative cost. The Federal Government normally pays half of such administrative costs, with the expectation that states will pay the remainder.
However, in South Carolina, Missouri, Texas and several other states, hospitals pay the state's share of salary costs for eligibility workers assigned to hospitals to review Medicaid applications. The hospitals benefit because Medicaid pays many hospital bills that would otherwise go unpaid. Medicaid recipients often have neither private insurance nor the means to pay their own bills.
Thus, for example, South Carolina hospitals are contributing $2.3 million to the state's Department of Social Services to pay for 168 state employees who check eligibility for Medicaid. The Federal Government gives the state an equal amount for the salaries of those workers.
The eight states that accept donations to secure Federal matching funds are Alabama, California, Georgia, Massachusetts, Missouri, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas. States that have been coonsidering such arrangements are Colorado, Florida, Indiana, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Utah and West Virginia.

HEADLINE: International Calamities Tax America's Compassion

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER

 BODY:
Caroline Trinidad, a New York City housewife and mother of four, cringes when she sees the painful images of a Kurdish woman cradling her hollow-eyed child or a Bangladeshi father touching his dead son's head. Then, as quickly as she can, she turns away.
"I want to do something, but I don't do anything. And I feel guilty," Mrs. Trinidad said this week, while she shared a snack at a shopping mall with her daughter and granddaughter. 
 "I get upset watching the babies dying. Who the hell wants to see that? I switch the channel. There's so much going on at once."
Surrounded by horrifying images of war, natural disaster, famine and pestilence in what relief agencies call an unprecedented convergence of international calamities, Americans are showing signs of disaster fatigue.
 
Numbed by So Much Sorrow
 Many of the 50 Americans interviewed this week in cities across the nation said they are moved by the suffering, but overloaded, confused, even numbed by so much sorrow from so many places at once -- the war in Iraq that displaced the Kurds, the cyclone in Bangladesh, the famine in Africa, the cholera epidemic in Peru and earthquakes in Soviet Georgia and Costa Rica.
These sentiments worry international relief agencies working feverishly to aid the millions of people in desolate landscapes dotting the globe. While Americans historically have given generously to such efforts, fund-raisers fear that all the calamities coming together are proving to be too much of a bad thing.
Though many Americans are contributing, the volume of donations has not surged sharply the way it did during the Ethiopian famine of 1984-85, said Peter J. Davies, president of InterAction, an umbrella organization for 132 relief agencies.
Then, the public was able to focus on one catastrophe. British Broadcasting Corporation film footage of children with bloated bellies and wizened faces aired on network television in October 1984, galvanizing public sympathy. And the song "We Are the World," recorded by famous entertainers, made the famine effort famous.
 
'How Do You Choose?'
 But now disasters are piling up like freight cars in a train wreck. "It's so complicated," said Phyllis M. Angelo, a retired teacher from Wakefield, Mass. "Who's going to help who? How? Who first?"
Some who want to help find that they first have to sort through a thicket of moral choices. Do we owe the Kurds more since we got them into that mess, they ask. Or should we help the innocents of Bangladesh, their homes swept away by tidal waves?
"How do you chose?! -- But I do. This is for the Kurds," a man from Pennsylvania wrote on a check for $1,000 he sent to CARE, an international relief organization.
Others find their concern finally moving to action. David Finckel, the cellist in the Emerson Quartet, who lives in Manhattan, said the members of his group want to do a concert for the children of Bangladesh. Phyllis Silverman, a psychotherapist in Manhattan, said she has not given any money yet, but is getting close.
 
'Can't Tune It Out Anymore'
 "When you just see pictures of dead babies, it's over. But when they're alive and suffering, you have to identify with the mother," she said. "I just can't tune it out anymore. I started connecting to what individuals are feeling."
Many other Americans, feeling the squeeze of recession and seeing the outstretched palms of the homeless on their own streets, have let the tragedies hit them in the gut, but not in the pocketbook.
Some expressed doubt that money contributed to international relief gets to the people who need it. Some said they would rather give to causes closer to home. Some have just tuned out. And some said they cannot afford to give.
Debbie Goldberg, who works in a bank in Chicago, tries to tell her three small children why there is hunger, but she does not give money to fight it abroad. She worries most about her family's economic survival.
"I am scared to death of losing my job and my husband is the same way," she said.
 
'Can't Even Get Unemployment'
 Donald Demby, a construction worker in Oakland, Calif., reacted testily to questions about international disasters. A sluggish local economy has wiped out his ability to give to any cause: "A person like me can't even get employment," he said.
Still, many who could give do not. "I know I should give something, and I know even a dollar a week would help a lot," said Casey Nonmacher, who manages a delicatessen in Houston. "But I guess I'm like most people, staying preoccupied with the stuff in my own life."
Bruce McInnes, who owns a tree-care consulting company in Manhattan, said the sheer number of catastrophes left him "confused and unfocused.
"There are so many problems," he said, "that even if you study the reportage, it's hard to tell what one person can do."
 
Gives Tips to Homeless
 The psychic wear-and-tear of life in New York City has left him "enameled" against the pleas of the homeless, though he said he tries to give to a street person at least once a day.
"By the time you get to the office and read the paper," he said, "you may be bereft of emotional capacity sufficient to move you to do something like writing a letter to your congressman saying, 'Do something for the Kurds.' "
Debbie Fleure, a waitress in an Oakland, Calif. pizzeria, said she tries to block out the disasters around the world, but she regularly gives her tips to the homeless.
"I figure somebody just gave it to me, I might as well pass it on," she said. "If Bangladesh had happened awhile ago, people could have helped. Now, with homelessness, problems in the schools, AIDS, crack -- when you start seeing all that here it really affects your ability to give."
Eric P. Davis, a Boston contractor, also sees a need to focus on the homefront. He started an ice-hockey progam for inner-city youth at a local rink, then watched it shut down recently because of state and city budget cuts.
"It's so disheartening to have all these countries get all the attention when we have people lying in the streets here," he said.
Officials in relief organizations, battling public fatigue, apathy and cynicism, rely on the press to get the word out. But while television moves some viewers to act, it numbs others, said Neil Postman, chairman of the Department of Communication Arts at New York University.
"The sheer abundance of images of suffering will tend to make people turn away," he said. "People respond when a little girl falls down a well. But if 70,000 people in Bangladesh are killed, of course people will say, 'Isn't that terrible' but I think the capacity for feeling is if not deadened, at least drugged."
Kay Hamner, an Atlanta executive, and Roux Harding, a Seattle window cleaner, find the images on the evening news strangely unaffecting.
"You can see real true-to-life pictures, but your mind reacts to it almost as if it's just a movie," Ms. Hamner said. Mr. Harding remarked, "It's too surreal when you're watching television."
 
Too Overpowering
 Other Americans find the images and stories all too overpowering. They avoid those items on the news or those articles in newspapers. Tracy Wik, an investment broker in Chicago, says she feels "sensory overload."
And Rob Andropolis, an excercise equipment salesman from Novato, Calif., said the slew of depressing news broadcasts induced him to switch from an all-news radio station to one that plays only classical music.
"I used to listen for the traffic reports and take the side routes," he said. "But now I just don't care if I get caught in traffic. The news was just too much."

Dollars Can Still Get You Scotch and Waterford Crystal in Baghdad

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, May 7

 BODY:
So far, Iraq's dollar-owning bourgeoisie with a taste for foreign living has been hit only selectively by the United Nations trade embargo.
At Baghdad's Duty Free Shopping Center -- a four-story emporium of imported goods for those with dollars -- the cans of pate de foie gras and the Parma hams have all been gone for several months. The only remaining foreign foods are boxes of Blue Diamond smoked almonds from Sacramento, Calif., and some crackers made in the United Arab Emirates. 
 But pretty much everything else is in plentiful supply, including Johnny Walker Black Label -- an Iraqi businessman's favorite tipple -- and wine from Italy and France, all at standard duty-free prices payable in dollars.
Upstairs are French dresses, Italian shoes, Sevres porcelain, Waterford crystal, German dishwashers, General Electric refrigerators, cosmetics and Harris Tweed jackets.
Amer Saleh, the center's manager, whirls his amber worry beads in his huge office complete with four telephones and three air conditioners, none of them working. "The blockade has stopped all imports," he said. "But we have stocks to last a year, perhaps two years."
 
The Money Game

Theoretically, the United Nations embargo bans all financial dealings with Iraq except for humanitarian purposes. But in practice, it has encouraged a flourishing black market in Iraqi dinars as residents try to change their outlawed currency for dollars, while foreign visitors seek to evade a punitive exchange rate.
Officially it takes $3 to buy one Iraqi dinar, although on the black market $1 used to buy six or seven dinars -- until just recently. In the last few days the Iraqi dinar suddenly shot through the ceiling, and the dollar collapsed, dropping in value to five dinars or under. But why?
The black market rate in the Baghdad souk is set by the rate Jordanian money changers pay for the Iraqi dinar in Amman. And one of Baghdad's biggest dealers, a jocular man known as Mr. Tariq, says he thinks that the Iraqi Government has been buying up its own dinars in Amman to increase their value.
A possible reason for doing so is that a stronger dinar makes foreign travel more expensive for those planning to go abroad when the travel ban is lifted May 15, by increasing the cost of acquiring dollars.
Alternatively, President Saddam Hussein may believe that a strong currency is a symbol of a country's national prestige.
 
 Babylon Revisited
 One ofPresident Hussein's favorite prestige projects has been the rebuilding of King Nebuchadnezzar's great southern palace in Babylon according to the designs of German archeologists early this century.
Work continued on the project through the long Iran-Iraq war, even though the Government had to import Sudanese laborers because its own were at the front.
Reconstruction has been more or less complete for a year now. And while archeologists may bicker over details, this immense set of interconnecting chambers and courtyards surrounded by crenelated fortifications is more interesting for visitors than the pile of mud that used to be all there was to see at Babylon.
Today, however, the southern temple is a desolate spot. Power and water have been cut off by the allied bombing, and its shops, museums and restaurants are closed.
But work is under way on a series of three huge viewing platforms just outside the walls of Nebuchadnezzar's Babylon from which visitors will be able to look down at new excavations Iraq is planning.
"This is the personal orders of the President," said Iraq's Director General of Antiquities, Mouyad Said.
Mr. Hussein has always identified with Babylon's most famous ruler. When Nebuchadnezzar built the southern palace in the sixth century B.C., he placed inscribed bricks in the walls telling his successors to repair it. Iraq's current leader has put similar bricks in his reconstruction, declaring that the palace was rebuilt "in the time of the leader Saddam Hussein."
 
 A Feminist Alert

Under the secular rule of President Hussein's Baath Party, women have come to have more freedom in Iraq than almost anywhere else in the Arab world.
Manal al-Lusy, the head of the Iraqi Women's Federation, traces the trends back to Hammurabi, King of Babylon in the 18th century B.C., pointing out that his legal code includes 93 provisions dealing with women's rights.
But now Iraq's feminists are worried by the President's promise to introduce multi-party democracy later this year. They fear that more democracy may lead to the rise of fundamentalist Islamic parties dedicated to putting women back under the veil, as has happened in Algeria and some other Arab countries.
Last month, Mrs. Lusy organized a meeting of women to discuss the danger. They agreed that the answer is for women to play an active role in founding the new parties.
"If we have democracy, I'm not going to believe all parties will support the rights of women like the Baath Party," she said. "Look at Egypt. There are no women in the Parliament there. But we have 15 out of 250."

Dreams Deferred and Payments Due

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
AS he urged New Yorkers to pitch in with sacrifice and courage to endure the city's worst fiscal pains in years, Mayor David N. Dinkins promised last week, "Together, we can ensure that our dreams, though deferred, will never, ever be denied."
The Mayor has been forced to defer dreams so often since he took office 16 months ago that he clings to that comforting phrase from Langston Hughes's poem "Harlem." But he sometimes seems to overlook the poem's final warning about what happens to a dream deferred.
Maybe it just sags
like a heavy load.
Or does it explode? 
 The $28.7 billion doomsday budget that Mr. Dinkins proposed to the City Council on Friday would explode many New Yorkers' fondest hopes for themselves and their city by closing homeless shelters, clinics and the Central Park Zoo, laying off about 20,000 workers and raising $1 billion in new taxes to pay for the privilege of not cutting even more.
The Council, up for re-election this fall, has vowed both to hold down Mr. Dinkins's proposed taxes and restore programs. Just how it can do that before the new fiscal year begins July 1 is unclear. But flexing its muscles under a new City Charter that gives it sole power to approve the budget, the Council is determined to try.
Mr. Dinkins hopes to avoid the very worst of the cuts by pressuring municipal unions -- to whom he recently granted raises -- and state officials to make concessions and give him more aid. But by any measure, the Mayor, squeezed between the recession and his own managerial choices to grant raises and hire thousands of police officers, will sacrifice much of the expansive agenda he campaigned for.
Twice on Thursday, in public at City Hall, he lost his composure, and he was forced to stop speaking. "People who think that this is some process that one engages in as an exercise really don't understand," he said. "Not if you care. This administration cares deeply."
That very tender-heartedness has sometimes tripped Mr. Dinkins as he sought to thread his way through the twisting maze of the city's deepening problems. In a somber televised speech last week, he assured residents, "At each step along the way, we have tried to cushion the blow." He has postponed layoffs as long as possible, losing flexibility and leading his predecessor, Edward I. Koch, to dismiss him as Scarlett O'Hara, content to think about it tomorrow. Actually, Mr. Dinkins seems more like Scarlett's rival, Melanie Hamilton, firm in his belief in the fundamental goodness of others. He often says, "Most people are truly good at heart."
Elected with broad union support, Mr. Dinkins suffered labor's scorn for sending mixed signals by first granting raises, then hiring thousands of police officers, then threatening layoffs. Up to now he has generally asked labor leaders for just what he needed, or even less. That has left the leaders, themselves elected officials, without the ability to follow the classic ritual of excoriating a demand for cuts by the city, then compromising after loud negotiations and finally claiming victory to their members.
The Mayor's latest demands -- more than half a billion dollars in concessions through wage deferrals, early retirements or work-rule changes, his aides say -- have produced conciliatory reactions. "It is not a point of options or cutting a deal," said Stanley Hill, the head of the largest city workers union, District Council 37 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. "It is a matter of necessity to avoid these massive cuts and layoffs."
Mr. Dinkins has had trouble making austerity sound appetizing to a city whose steady but elusive goal for more than a decade was to restore the perceived quality of life of the days before the fiscal crisis of 1975. From 1982 to the time Mr. Dinkins took office, nearly 50,000 workers were added to the city workforce, many of them in the proud and politically irresistible name of recovery. "Blood, toil, tears and sweat may have worked wonders for Winston Churchill, but it cuts no ice at City Hall in 1991," Felix G. Rohatyn, the head of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, said before Mr. Dinkins's latest proposed cuts.
Now Mr. Dinkins is seeking help from the corporation, which was set up to borrow money on the city's behalf in the last crisis, hoping for $200 million to $300 million through refinancing some of the corporation's bonds. Mr. Rohatyn has agreed to talk, but has made no promises.
Meanwhile, Mr. Dinkins has pressed Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who is facing even bigger fiscal problems, for more aid, and vowed to do whatever it takes to avoid a takeover of the city's finances by the State Financial Control Board, which Mr. Cuomo heads. The control board could reimpose binding powers over city spending if the city ended the current year with a deficit of $100 million or more or lost access to the bond market.
Mr. Dinkins has declared high noon so many times in his administration that by now it seems like four o'clock at City Hall. New Yorkers who wonder just what is going on might take comfort from some other lines of Langston Hughes:
There's liable
to be confusion
in a dream deferred.
From river to river,
Uptown and down,
There's liable to be confusion
when a dream gets kicked around.

HEADLINE: African Dilemma: Food Aid May Prolong War and Famine

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ

 BODY:
ONCE again, the reports of starvation are trickling in from parts of Africa. And it is clearly no coincidence that the countries most menaced by famine this season are those that have been mired in long civil wars. Impoverished, warring nations have the worst food problems: peasants cannot plant or harvest during war, armies and rebels confiscate food for themselves, including in some cases well-intentioned Western supplies.
As Western nations gear up yet again to save the starving peoples of Africa they find themselves caught between their humanitarian obligation to feed the hungry and their growing conviction that donated food, far from solving the problem, may in some cases be aggravating rather than alleviating the hunger. In case after case, these officials believe, food from outside helps to subsidize the habits of civil war. 
 This time, too, the relief effort is overshadowed by the immediate needs of people elsewhere -- the Kurds in Iraq, the cyclone-devastated Bangladheshis -- whose disasters came in swift blows.
The United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization says as many as 35 million people are at risk in the six African countries most threatened by famine: the Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia, Liberia, Mozambique and Angola. These countries have one common thread: civil war. In Angola a peace accord has just been concluded, a positive sign; but because of the intensity of the war and the still-hot suspicions, food supplies for those in need will probably not immediately improve, officials say.
In Ethiopia and the Sudan, where drought as well as drawn-out war have contributed to crop failures, the end of conflict would make it much easier to deliver relief food. In eastern Ethiopia, a relief truck hit a mine last month; in southern Sudan, food convoys are regularly shot at by Taposa tribesmen armed by the Government. In Kopeata, a town under the control of the Sudan People's Liberation Army for more than two years, the marketplace remains barren because the few peasants who might have food to sell are fearful of moving from their villages.
"If peace prevailed there would be no problem in dealing with the shortages -- the commercial systems would work better and so would the relief systems," said Willard J. Pearson, director of the United States Agency for International Development office in Ethiopia.
 
Falling Short of the Need
 But there are shortages, most of all shortages of aid. In the Sudan, where Save the Children says 10 million people are in danger of starving, the United Nations has said that 1.2 million tons of food are needed in 1991. But a Save the Children report said so far only about 72,000 tons have been delivered. The United States has pledged about 300,000 tons of food, and Government figures show spending of $82 million for the Sudan and $53 million for Ethiopia between October 1990 and March. The European Community has pledged $167 million, or 400,000 tons of food, to African nations, but has not yet decided how to raise the money.
As officials of Western governments reassess their past unquestioning efforts to provide relief, they are not, they say, sending less food to places of need. It is not feasible, these officials say, to impose strict "you make peace or we won't give you food" conditions on food aid.
"If you condition the food aid on a certain event such as negotiations taking place and play a game of hardball to see how many people die, the humanitarian providers are going to blink first," said an American official organizing food aid to Africa.
On both humanitarian grounds and for domestic political reasons it would be unacceptable to allow mass deaths by starvation. Americans, even if a little weary of hearing about what seems like constant famine in Africa, do not like seeing starving Africans on their television screens if they believe something can be done to stop the suffering. But, said one official, "we need to organize a strategy in a more hard-minded way."
Humanitarian policies of donating millions of tons of food to warring governments and rebels have helped prop up combatants who care little for the civilians they purport to represent. With the food needs of the starving entirely taken care of by outsiders, the warring parties sometimes partake of the donated food themselves or find themselves left with more resources than they might otherwise have.
Last year, for example, the International Monetary Fund found that the Sudanese Government had sold large stocks of pre-drought grain abroad. Much of the foreign exchange earned by the sales is believed to have been spent on weaponry from China to continue the civil war against the southern part of the country, now in its 20th year.
Now, with the Sudanese Government's reserve food stocks sold, the United States and European donors find themselves struggling to deliver hundreds of thousands of tons of grain to stave off starvation among the Sudanese, against what have been almost insuperable barriers placed by the regime.
In Ethiopia it has been common practice for local government militia members to receive as a form of payment bags of food sent for famine relief. Now, Western donors are trying to weave through war zones to deliver food to hungry Ethiopian civilians as well as Sudanese and Somalian refugees who have sought sanctuary in Ethiopia from their own civil wars.
In southern Sudan, where the Sudan People's Liberation Army controls almost all the territory, Western donors say the leaders behave as though it were the international community's duty to feed the civilians while the rebel forces fight. 
During a visit to Kopeata, the French Minister for Humanitarian Action, Bernard Kouchner, told representatives of the rebel group that sympathy in the West for African people perpetually at war was wearing thin.
"The international community is tired of the mix of war, politics and drought," Mr. Kouchner told representatives of the rebel army and of the Sudan Relief and Rehabilitation Association, its civilian wing.
Mr. Kouchner's anger was sparked in part by the hopeless and virtually unchanged conditions in Kopeata, which the rebel army has controlled for more than two years and to which much aid has been sent. "There is a new hospital ward but that is not good enough," said Mr. Kouchner. "They are asking for white people to pay for everything."
A more hard-minded policy toward food deliveries would involve, among other things, more monitoring of where relief food goes, American officials said. More of an effort has to be made, they said, to insure that food designated for civilians does not end up in the hands of either government or rebel armies.
On the rebel sides of both the Ethiopian and Sudanese conflicts, for example, large quantities of food are provided by Western donors with no precise knowledge of where it goes. For the last several years, the United States has quietly provided food to the relief organizations of the Eritrean People's Liberation Front and the Tigrean People's Liberation Front, rebel groups that appear to be on the verge of defeating the Ethiopian Government. The food is moved from Port Sudan across the Sudanese border but is not accompanied by outside monitors. During their recent successful offensives, the Ethiopian rebels captured the best food-producing areas in Ethiopia -- the provinces of Gojjam and Gondar -- presenting another reason, some Washington officials suggest, for slowing the unmonitored food across the Sudanese border.
Similarly, the United States has been sending food through Kenya to rebel-held southern Sudan. In southern Sudan, there are fewer aid officials from outside agencies than ever before. This is in part because of the increasingly hostile attitude of the Sudanese People's Liberation Army and the Sudan Relief and Rehabilitation Association toward Western relief officials.
Some United Nations food monitors have been expelled by the rebel army in the last year because, according to United Nations officials, they asked too many questions.
And when Mr. Kouchner left southern Sudan he took with him a French volunteer doctor who had been thrown in a pit -- a form of jail -- by the rebels after taking a photograph of a water pump. The doctor, Jean Michel Bouvard of the organization Aide Medicale Internationale, said the rebel group also denied him use of the United Nations radio to contact the outside world.
Mr. Kouchner asked the rebels to allow the doctor to use the radio but when they refused, the doctor cut his stay short and left. Dr. Bouvard said he believed the rebels were hostile toward him because he was not offering tangible goods, like food, that they could use, but rather medical services for civilians.

As Funds for Welfare Shrink, Ideas Flourish

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
NOBODY likes welfare, and this year it shows. Across the country, officials are unveiling proposals to pay the poor less, work them more and coerce or cajole them into families with fewer children and a father at home. Black and white, liberal and conservative -- everyone seems to have a thirst for change and a six-point plan to boot.
Unease about the dole is an emotion as old as America itself; the nation has spent centuries trying to solve the dilemma of how to supply enough support to help but not so much as to foster dependency. This year, another factor upsets the seesaw: money. Case loads are up, coffers are empty and deficit-ridden state governments are looking for places to tinker and cut. 
But beyond these immediate, budget-driven pressures, something more enduring may be under way. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat known for his rhetorical sweep, reads into the pattern of a cut here, a work requirement there, the stirrings of a new epoch that he grandly terms "post-industrial social policy."
"What you are seeing is the steady emergence of dependency as the defining issue of American social welfare policy," he said.
In the industrial era of the last 100 years, he argued, the curse was sudden unemployment -- "the Hoovervilles of people accustomed to working, but suddenly without a job." By contrast, he said, "the curse of this era is dependency -- people who aren't in the work force at all." Recent studies show that more than 30 percent of the nation's children will spend a year on welfare before they reach age 18, he said, making welfare, next to public schools, "the most important program we've got."
One category of current proposals would simply cut checks. Another would add work requirements. A third would mix carrots and sticks to guide the poor into smaller and more stable families.
In terms of cutbacks, Michigan has gone farthest and fastest. Facing a $1.1 billion deficit, Gov. John Engler, a Republican, took office in January and reduced welfare checks by 17 percent. Under Aid to Families with Dependent Children, this cut the monthly payment for a family of three to $436, from $525. Smaller, but still substantial cuts have been proposed by the Republican Governor of California, Pete Wilson, and passed last week by the liberal Democrats who govern the City Council in the District of Columbia. These cuts come at a time when the purchasing power of A.F.D.C. payments nationwide has already eroded by 42 percent since 1970.
A second group of proposals has focused on swapping work for welfare. This, of course, is scarcely a new idea; it is essentially what President Franklin D. Roosevelt did in the Depression when he started the Works Progress Administration. But recent experiments have remained small in scale, and forcing poor women to work is a tougher, and potentially more expensive, goal than many people realize. Many mothers would need child-care services. Supervision on the job can be expensive. And sanctions can be difficult to enforce, since cuts in aid to the mother are cuts to the child as well.
Current work proposals include a referendum passed last fall in Oregon seeking Federal permission to start a six-county experiment to replace welfare with a system of guaranteed jobs. Those involved would be paid 90 percent of the minimum wage, a rate intended to maintain the incentive to find regular work.
In New York, the state Social Services Commissioner, Cesar A. Perales, has proposed adding a work provision to the state's Home Relief program, which serves poor people who don't qualify for A.F.D.C.
 
Disintegrating Families
 The third set of proposals takes as its target the dissipating American family, a problem contributing heavily to poverty rates. While 12.8 percent of the population falls below the poverty line, that figure is 35.9 percent for members of female-headed households.
During his unsuccessful campaign for Governor of Massachusetts, John R. Silber, the outspoken conservative Democrat, made headlines when he suggested abolishing welfare for teen-age mothers who have a second child. "If she gets pregnant again, until she is married and capable of taking care of her own children, she will receive no welfare whatsoever," he said. "And if she cannot care for her child, her children will be taken away from her."
Perhaps an even greater controversy erupted in Kansas when state Representative Kerry Patrick, a Republican, proposed financial incentives for welfare mothers to use the contraceptive Norplant. He would pay them a $500 one-time bonus, plus $50 a month, to have the device implanted.
Critics called the proposal an attempt at coercion, and it failed by a 77-to-27 vote. They also said it misdiagnoses the problem, since the average welfare family now has only three members. Mr. Patrick said he hoped to save the state money and help mothers avoid long stays on welfare.
In recent months several elected officials have made other proposals intended to retool the families of the poor. In Wisconsin, Gov. Tommy Thompson, a Republican, would stop paying teen-age mothers extra money for additional children and would provide financial bonuses to those who marry. In New Jersey, a plan put forward by Representative Wayne R. Bryant, the Democratic majority leader of the State Assembly, included similar provisions. Likening the current system to slavery, Mr. Bryant, who is black, said, "We, as African-Americans, know very well that it separates fathers and mothers from their children."
To some degree, these and other proposals are building on principles espoused in the 1988 Family Support Act, the welfare redesign crafted by Senator Moynihan. It requires an increasing percentage of welfare mothers to enroll either in work or training programs as a condition of their aid. But the law is just now taking effect, and many states have little money to get programs off the ground.
Senator Moynihan has pointed to the legislation as the capstone of a career in social policy that attracted attention in 1965, when his explosive Labor Department paper, known as the Moynihan Report, warned that a quarter of black children were being born to single mothers. Now, a quarter of all American children are born to single mothers, and the figure for blacks is 63.5 percent.
"I've been making this case, and feeling a little more confident about it, and a little more articulate, for a quarter century," Senator Moynihan said.
Mickey Kaus, the author of a forthcoming book that includes a history of welfare-policy debates, agrees that eliminating dependency is the biggest challenge. But Mr. Kaus, who wants to abolish welfare and start a huge system of guaranteed Government jobs, says the Family Support Act is "a small improvement" riddled with loopholes.
"Moynihan's great at analyzing the problem," he said. But pointing to the constantly worsening statistics, he added: "Unfortunately, he's consistently failed to come up with the solution."

HEADLINE: The Disasters Multiply And Compassion Falters

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
RELIEF agency officials say there has never been a time in recent history when so many disasters with such different natures have struck so many people.
The exodus of two million Kurds from their homes in Iraq resulted from a political crisis, a brief but bloody civil war that broke out in the aftermath of the allied victory over the Iraqis. 
 That was followed by a natural disaster: a cyclone in Bangladesh -- the 55th since 1900 -- which has killed more than 125,000 people and left 10 million others homeless. The predictions are that as many as 300,000 people may die from starvation, exposure and disease.
Meanwhile, a cholera epidemic is spreading across Peru and other South American countries and earthquakes have recently struck Costa Rica and Soviet Georgia.
And 27 million people in six countries in north Africa face death from starvation and civil war in what the relief agency Save the Children has called "the worst famine in Africa in living memory."
The task of ministering to a world ravaged by disaster has overwhelmed private humanitarian organizations, the United Nations and donor governments. Traditional donors, battered by so many appeals, are weary of pouring money into crises that never seem to go away. The result is a discouragingly contagious compassion fatigue. Even though many relief agencies report that donations have only dipped slightly despite the global recession, they say that the scope of the crisis requires a massive infusion of money and attention from new sources.
"Those of us who have been in the battle for years are tired and battered," said Tom Getman, director of government relations at World Vision, a private relief organization. "It's time for a whole new cadre of donors to emerge from around the world." To educate and encourage potential donors in the United States, Interaction, an umbrella group representing more than 100 relief organizations, will introduce a 900 telephone line next week.
While the world responded, albeit somewhat belatedly, to the Kurdish crisis, it has been more difficult to drum up enthusiasm for Bangladesh, whose history has been cursed by natural disasters. The United States, for example, has given $7 million for cyclone relief and 67,000 tons of food, and has received approval for additional food aid and funds. Bangladesh has pleaded for military helicopters to ferry food and medical supplies that are sitting in warehouses waiting for a delivery system, with little response.
The refugee relief effort in northern Iraq, by contrast, will cost the United States and its allies between $500 million and $700 million for the first six months of its operation.
The response to an evolving, seemingly endless crisis like the famine in the Sudan, a byproduct both of war and the government's refusal to heed the warning signals of famine, is even less enthusiastic.
Helping the victims of African famine was in vogue in the mid-1980's, and there is a reluctance to believe that the problem not only remains unsolved, but will be much worse this time.

Adding Up Concern For Bush and Doubts About Quayle, the Democrats Get Zero

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
PRESIDENT BUSH'S irregular heartbeat sent a tremor through American politics last week. Suddenly, there was new talk of the "Quayle factor" and a flurry of polls that showed a majority of Americans still queasy at the thought of a Quayle Presidency.
After a spring when Mr. Bush seemed destined for a triumphant, painless stroll to re-election, it was an object lesson in how quickly the political ground might shift. The post-war euphoria is fading, the economy still lags and Mr. Bush's health problem, although soon attributed to a treatable thyroid condition, reminded many people -- including nearly half of the Republicans -- that they would prefer someone else as Vice President, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll. 
 In the midst of all this, the President was forced to crack down on the travels of his chief of staff, John Sununu, in response to embarassing reports about his heavy use of military aircraft.
These may not be huge vulnerabilities, but they should be enough to occupy an opposition party 18 months before a Presidential election. The Democrats, however, are consumed once again with their own problems. In Cleveland, Des Moines and points between, they were thrashing about, fighting over message and strategy and divided over issues. At this point four years ago, they were griping about their Presidential field, often referred to as "the seven dwarves." Now, with just one official candidate in the race, former senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts, Democrats would be grateful for options of whatever size.
What they desperately need is a leader with a unifying vision. The party seems more balkanized than diverse these days; Republicans have the luxury of watching the opposition fight itself. "They can't take advantage of any opportunities," said Mary Matalin, chief of staff of the Republican National Committee.
 
In Search of Themselves
 Throughout the 1980's, as Democrats struggled to adjust to the rise of Reaganism, the party was pulled in two directions: Centrists and conservatives, many of them based in the South, argued that the national party must lose its liberal image and broaden its appeal to the middle class. The liberals, meanwhile, warned of losing the Democratic soul and said that a tough "progressive" message could win with the right messenger. This debate was waged last week with an edge of anger.
In Des Moines, the Coalition for Democratic Values, a group of liberals, railed against what Senator Howard Metzenbaum of Ohio called "shadow Republicans" in their own party. They re-committed themselves to aggressive new government efforts on health care and other domestic needs. They listened to populist stalwarts like Jim Hightower, the former Texas Agriculture Commissioner, inveigh against Wall Street.
In Cleveland, the Democratic Leadership Council, a group of conservatives and centrists, approved a manifesto that declares: "In the minds of too many Americans, the Democratic Party has stood for government programs that don't work, special interests before the interests of ordinary people and a reluctance to assert American values at home and abroad." They disavowed racial hiring quotas, although saying they supported equal opportunity, and endorsed a variety of programs to end welfare dependency. They also broke soundly with organized labor on the free trade issue and endorsed giving the President "fast track" authority in negotiations with Mexico.
 
Lecturing Leaders
 Meanwhile, down the street in Cleveland, the United Auto Workers held a rally against the "fast track" for a Mexican treaty. And across town, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who was very pointedly not invited to speak at the leadership council meeting, was holding forth in a union hall on "rebuilding America."
Ronald H. Brown, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, went to Cleveland with the attitude of a disgusted hall monitor, sternly lecturing the leadership council that "factions and bickering serve no purpose except to strengthen our opposition." Indeed, on trade and civil rights, the debate was moving onto the most sensitive ground, the Democratic Party's relationship with blacks and organized labor.
But there are many Democrats who argue that the party needs a cathartic debate over what it stands for, that years of muting and avoiding conflict have only made the Democrats a complacent, ill-defined Congressional party. There are Democrats, as well, who say that the generational transition begun by Gary Hart has stalled; Mr. Hart came close to the nomination in 1984 by arguing for "new ideas" and a fresh look at party orthodoxy, while attacking Walter F. Mondale as the captive of interest groups.
There are other tensions: the Congressional wing of the party, accustomed to coalition government and consensus-building politics, often ends up undercutting efforts to create a distinctive Democratic message. For example, many party strategists are convinced that tax cuts for the middle class, such as a cut in the payroll tax for Social Security, are a galvanizing issue. But many Democratic leaders in Congress have been cool to the idea, saying that tinkering with taxes invites trouble.
For all of that, party leaders saw some hopeful signs last week. After months when the 1992 Democratic nomination seemed more a burden than a prize, some politicians began showing interest. Senator John D. Rockefeller 4th of West Virginia, who had ruled out a run for the nomination a few months ago, announced that he was reopening the door. It was not clear, however, whether he is interested in 1992 or simply wanted to draw attention to his proposals for health care and position himself for a race in 1996.
Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, one of the prime movers in the Coalition for Democratic Values, also indicated a touch of Presidential ambition, while Senator Albert Gore Jr. of Tennesse and Gov. L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia continued to look like likely candidates.
Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, chairman of the leadership council, fared well in the spotlight last week as an articulate spokesman for a tough-minded yet humane approach to social welfare programs. But he shares all governors' glaring resume flaw: a lack of foreign policy experience. Senator Gore is conversant on foreign policy, but his attempt to present a domestic vision to the leadership council last week fell flat.
In the meantime, there is an almost palpable longing within the party for a leader.
Even when a Republican President has an 81 percent approval rating, there is, after all, a Democratic base in this country. No one who watched Michael S. Dukakis march resignedly toward defeat in the final days of 1988 could doubt it: Democrats turned out, dutifully, sometimes almost tearfully, to cheer on a candidate they barely knew. These loyalists wait and remember. In Iowa last week, Representative Dave Nagle brought a hush to a Democratic gathering as he talked about Robert F. Kennedy. "I can still see him, on a platform, the sun setting behind him, quoting Shaw," Mr. Nagle said, and the audience was very still and sad.

Is Nuclear Winter Giving Way to Nuclear Spring?

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
WITH global warming, research on safer reactors and the need for more energy all converging, advocates of nuclear power see signs that the industry is overcoming years of public criticism and doubt.
On May 2, the Tennessee Valley Authority was granted permission by the Government to restart one of three reactors at the Browns Ferry plant in northern Alabama after the longest shutdown for safety reasons in the history of the industry. With the startup scheduled for sometime before the end of the month, Browns Ferry will be the last of five nuclear plants in the United States to open after extended closures. 
 An even more significant event occurred on April 10, when the National Academy of Sciences urged the Government to quickly develop and test a new generation of reactors. Unlike coal-fired electric plants, the academy noted, nuclear reactors produce none of the carbon compounds that cause global warming. Designs under consideration in the United States, Japan and Europe would have far less likelihood of melting down in an accident than would conventional reactors, according to engineers.
Recently, three environmental groups that have opposed nuclear energy -- the National Audubon Society, the World Resources Institute and the Union of Concerned Scientists -- have guardedly recognized the technology's potential and accepted the need for more research. "Because of the global warming problem these new generation reactors have to be looked into for insurance purposes," said Dr. Jan Beyea, a nuclear physicist with the National Audubon Society in New York.
In the public mind, the accident at Three Mile Island in 1979, followed seven years later by the catastrophe at Chernobyl, seemed to seal the technology's fate as a long-term source of electricity. In 1989 alone, the Long Island Lighting Company pulled the fuel rods from the brand new Shoreham plant, voters in California shut Rancho Seco, a nuclear plant south of Sacramento, and the owners of the Fort St. Vrain nuclear plant in Colorado closed it after years of dismal operation.
Though it is far from clear whether the engineering and political trends of the last few months will persuade utilities to start buying reactors again, the industry is optimistic about making a comeback.
The Department of Energy is spending $160 million this year on research to design a new generation of safer, advanced reactors. The country's major manufacturers -- Westinghouse, General Electric, Combustion Engineering and Babcock and Wilcox -- have entered into joint ventures among themselves and with foreign reactor builders to search for new designs. Legislation sponsored by the Bush Administration to make licensing faster is receiving support in Congress.
 
Weighing Alternatives
 In its National Energy Strategy, made public earlier this year, the Department of Energy estimated that demand for electricity in the year 2010 will rise to 950 billion watts from 700 billion today. Energy conservation could slow the increase but will not eliminate it, the Energy Department said. Other options also present problems. Most of the good hydroelectric sites have already been taken and environmentalists are battling to save the last wild stretches of river from the dam builders. Solar power shows increasing promise, but the Government has been reluctant to provide much financing for research, and the largescale manufacture of photovoltaic panels would produce toxic chemical pollution. Burning and mining coal are an environmental menace.
The future of nuclear power will not be decided, though, until utility boards of directors are convinced the technology will be accepted by the public. "Neither Wall Street nor Main Street seems very supportive of a renewal of nuclear power," said Dan W. Reicher, a lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council.
That is true in financial circles. But there are signs that the public is less fearful than it used to be. When a fire and explosion destroyed the electrical transformer of the Maine Yankee plant late last month, citizens of Wiscasset, where the reactor has operated for 19 years, reacted with a giant yawn. The announcement that T.V.A. was close to starting Browns Ferry was greeted with enthusiasm in Alabama.
Still, enduring national acceptance will not come until the nuclear industry solves two problems it has battled since the beginning of the 1950's -- making reactors more reliable and disposing of radioactive wastes.
Billions of dollars spent on new equipment and training since Three Mile Island has resulted in fewer unplanned shutdowns and fewer accidents, according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The country's reactors operated at 68 percent of their capacity last year, a higher rate than in any other year, but still not as good as that of some other sources of power.
The industry is still years away from solving the nuclear waste problem. After spending hundreds of millions of dollars studying a site in Nevada for disposing the most dangerous radioactive wastes, the Department of Energy said last year that its program was a technical failure and that the Government was going to start over.
The industry's problems, though, are not deterring the Tennessee Valley Authority, a Federal agency based in Knoxville, Tenn. Once rebuked by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and reviled by independent authorities for its inability to operate nuclear reactors safely, the T.V.A. was commended last year by the Government for its operation of the Sequoyah Nuclear power plant in Soddy Daisy, Tenn. Sequoyah, closed from 1985 to 1988 for repairs, was ranked second in the United States and eighth in the world in 1989 for its reliability and the amount of electricity it generated.
Marvin Runyon, the chairman of the T.V.A., believes nuclear power is just as economical as generating electricity from coal and ultimately safer for the environment. In an interview last week, Mr. Runyon said he plans to restart two more reactors at Browns Ferry, and complete four other reactors at two unfinished nuclear plants in Alabama and Tennessee before the end of the decade. He is even considering buying a new reactor, the first ordered in the United States since 1973.

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
The C.I.A. in Limbo

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB

 BODY:
The next Director of Central Intelligence will inherit various spying activities totaling $30 billion yearly and a Central Intelligence Agency, the jewel in his crown, on the verge of irrelevance. The successor will step into a universe of a dozen grossly overlapping agencies, of cutthroat bureaucratic competition, of dizzyingly potent and expensive equipment like a spy satellite costing $1.5 billion and of organizations clumsily trying to make the transition from the cold war to a bewilderingly diverse "peace."
 Unless President Bush selects a powerful and experienced new spy chief, two things will surely occur: The C.I.A., already sleepy and isolated, will float into bureaucratic outer space, taking with it the talents of thousands of analysts and agents. And billions of dollars will be wasted in Washington inner space, as rival agencies triplicate tasks and scramble for influence with little sense of mission and excellence. 
 The story of disarray in the U.S. spy world follows a pattern now all too familiar.
 The Agency, as it is known in Washington, provided scant warning of Iraq's attack on Kuwait and raised few alarms about the war's bloody aftermath. Once the fighting began, the Pentagon easily shouldered the gentlemanly C.I.A. aside and ran its own intelligence show. Throughout, White House and State Department officials condemned the Agency for mundane and watered-down analyses and predictions.
 No one wants to blame the outgoing spy chief, Judge William Webster, for the mess. He did not come to the job four years ago as an intelligence or national security expert. His principal duty was to restore the C.I.A.'s integrity after the Iran-contra affair and other illegal activities carried out by his predecessor, William Casey. Judge Webster rebuilt trust brilliantly.
 But the judge had no stomach for bureaucratic in-fighting (particularly with the Pentagon, which controls most of his intelligence budget plus its own) and not much feel for how to fit secret information into policy debates. Top-secret Agency studies quickly became irrelevant to the policy makers. Senior officials became their own intelligence analysts, a disposition well ensconced before the war because of the Agency's lackluster predictions about Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.
The Agency could not get its act together on the gulf war. On July 20 and 25, a senior C.I.A. analyst predicted that there "may be" war, but not that Iraq would try to conquer all of Kuwait. On the 25th, he was rebutted by the senior agency analyst on the Mideast, and the top C.I.A. brass sided with the Mideast expert -- until 24 hours before the attack.
 The C.I.A., like the military, badly overestimated the number of Iraqi troops in Kuwait and their preparations to use chemical weapons. And compared with military estimates, the Agency was way off in estimating U.S. bomb damage.
 Commendably, the Agency in October predicted widespread rebellions by Kurds and Shiites after the war. But inexplicably, the top brass never pressed these views when victory was in sight.
 War predictions aside, the main task of the intelligence community now is to refocus resources and talents away from the Soviet Union -- and on new threats from economic competition, terrorism, drugs and the environment. The myriad agencies and departments involved in intelligence are making that transition, very slowly and in their usual fashion -- by expensive triplication of effort. Still, more than half the $30 billion spending total goes to countering the badly weakened Soviet war machine. What an incredible waste.
Mr. Bush is seriously considering only one candidate for the daunting task of bringing order and quality to the intelligence bureaucracy. That's Robert Gates, the President's deputy national security adviser. He knows foreign policy, is a tough manager and wily bureaucrat, and has been a career C.I.A. professional.
 Mr. Gates is fully qualified except for a black cloud hovering over his head. Suspicions remain in Congress that he knew more about the illegal Iran-contra caper than he acknowledged in sworn testimony. That cloud has to be cleared away expeditiously before the Director's job is offered, so that Mr. Gates can concentrate not on defending himself but on building a lean, refocused first-class intelligence operation.

HEADLINE: Why Help the Soviet Union?

 BODY:
Sending the Soviet people $1.5 billion in new credits to buy food would be a decent thing to do. It would also serve hard-headed American interests. So it is good to hear that President Bush is looking for a way to provide the aid, despite considerable advice to the contrary.
"When people are hungry," he said last week, "we ought to try to help." It's more than a humanitarian gesture and it's much more than a favor to Mikhail Gorbachev. It's a sign to anxious Soviet citizens that Americans care. 
 By giving aid now, Mr. Bush also lends support to the encouraging spirit of compromise between Mr. Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin that could revitalize flagging reform. And aid deepens America's economic and political engagement with its former rival. That could consolidate relations as the Soviet Union goes through the travail of transformation. After all, U.S.-Soviet cooperation is the keystone to any new world order Mr. Bush hopes to build.
Supplies of U.S. grain could insure against shortages in a Soviet Union caught between a command economy that's disintegrating and a market economy that's not yet functioning. Moscow wants guarantees of $1.5 billion in commercial bank loans. But it's not creditworthy under U.S. law, so Mr. Bush has to find a way to provide the aid.
Some critics say $1.5 billion of food aid would be a drop in the bucket, if not money down the drain. They fear it would be quickly consumed and yield no lasting economic benefit. But they ignore the political message of aid.
Aid is also being resisted by U.S. hard-liners who don't like that message. They want to accelerate the Soviet Union's economic collapse and political disintegration and undermine Mr. Gorbachev. But that's shortsighted. Washington could reasonably seek assurance that food is going to those who need it most. Getting that assurance opens the way to economic engagement with the restive Soviet republics as well as with Moscow.
Such engagement is essential as the nine core republics move toward federation and the others seem headed for commonwealth status or independence. Whatever shape the Union takes, the U.S. will still have to cooperate with the central government, with its formidable nuclear arsenal.
Mr. Bush sees aid as a reward to Mr. Gorbachev. "Yes, the Soviet Union is fighting difficult times," Mr. Bush said. "But I am not about to forget history." He went on to cite the Soviet leader's "enormous accomplishments" in promoting perestroika and glasnost, allowing Eastern Europe to go its own way and working "in sync" with Washington in the gulf war despite opposition at home.
However much aid might bolster Mr. Gorbachev, it would also yield a more enduring effect. As the last six months of turmoil show, the path of Soviet transformation is long and treacherous -- and stumbles can harm relations with the U.S. To cast bread on Soviet waters will strengthen those relations, and serve America's enduring interests.

HEADLINE: Political Correctness Besets the Left and Right

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Brent Staples, in commenting on "political correctness" (Editorial Notebook, April 17), does not see the threat to free expression at American universities. The policies to ban allegedly sexist and racist language and eliminate traditional history courses are subject to broad interpretation and may have a chilling effect on academic freedom. 
 The tendency toward left-wing conformism in the academy results in a pressure on independent thinkers to mouth politically correct views. The problem has grown since the 1960's and has not appeared just since the end of the cold war.
As to black enrollment at universities, because of economic inequality and cutbacks in student grants and loans, such enrollment dropped. However, particular universities that have the goal of maintaining or increasing the number of black students were forced to compete with one another for a shrinking pool of applicants. While politically correct admissions teams might be able to change standards to admit X number of blacks at their institutions, they are powerless to eliminate the economic and social trends that shape the national applicant pools.
Although pacifist activism may, as Mr. Staples says, be a prized goal of the politically correct, he is wrong to wonder why there was "no campus peace movement during the war in the Persian Gulf." There was only a small movement, because of the quick United States military victory.
The term "politically correct" does not equate liberalism with intellectual tyranny as Mr. Staples argues. On the contrary, it is the politically correct leftists, not genuine liberals, who are most inclined to be intellectual tyrants. Traditional liberals are more open-minded than the new politically correct left.
A major reason for the politically correct leftist zeal inside the academy is the low state of left-wing politics in the real, nonacademic world. Both the conservative critics of academic political correctness and Mr. Staples have overlooked the attempts of the political right and big business to impose their own kinds of correctness outside the academy.
Since 1980, the conservative Republican domination of American politics has made it politically incorrect to advocate progressive taxation and big, new Federal social programs. Most Democrats have engaged in acts of self-censorship about these subjects. This self-gagging of a once great political party has weakened the quality of debate in our elections. Conservative business interests have also threatened free speech by hitting their critics with lawsuits known as strategic litigation against public participation, or Slapp suits. Corporations use such cases to try intimidating their opponents into silence.
Leftist and conservative forces alike attempt to reduce the level of debate in the spheres they dominate. We must recognize and oppose the threats to freedom posed by the politically correct of both the left and the right.

HEADLINE: Foreign Peanut Toxins Could Harm Liver

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Lunch Without Peanut Butter" (editorial, April 21), you support a recommendation to allow peanuts grown outside this country to enter our food chain in order to eliminate the economic inequity of a controlled market. This could have serious health ramifications. 
 Any suspension of the import ban would have to include stringent measures to check for afflatoxins. An afflatoxin is a poison produced by some strains of Aspergillas flavus, which thrive on stored peanuts (and grains). This toxin is known to produce liver cancers in rats, fowl and fish. It is suspected of being a significant contributor to human liver cancer in Africa and Southeast Asia. Although afflatoxins are found in some of our food, the amounts are low and presumably pose no serious health threat. There has been a downward trend in deaths from liver cancer in the United States.
We should be concerned with a decent living for farmers in the third world, and should explore all means to raise their standard of living, but not at the expense of our children's health.

HEADLINE: A Crisis at Prenatal Clinic in Yonkers

BYLINE: By ROBERTA HERSHENSON

DATELINE: YONKERS

 BODY:
DELIVERY DAY was near for Tawanya Tuck and Ronda Terry, two Yonkers women expecting their first babies this month. The women, who are friends, had come to the prenatal clinic at St. John's Riverside Hospital here for their weekly checkups. After being examined by a doctor, the mothers-to-be met with a registered nurse, Margie Linton, to learn more about what to expect during labor. 
 Although neither woman had been seen here during the critical first trimester of pregnancy -- Ms. Tuck came in her fourth month and Miss Terry in her sixth -- both are part of a system that will insure the best possible care for them and their infants.
 
Treading a Dangerous Line
 Countless other pregnant women in this city, however, tread a dangerous line betwee no prenatal care at all and eventual delivery in a hospital that knows nothing about their medical histories. Their plight, caused by a confluence of social and economic problems, has been termed a crisis by county health administrators.
A shortage of prenatal care is not unique to Yonkers, but the problem is highlighted here. Of the 102 babies countywide who died before their first birthdays in 1988, the latest year for which figures are available, 34 were born to Yonkers residents. Although that is one-third of the deaths, Yonkers residents that year accounted for only about one-fourth of live births, 2,911 out of 12,168. Black babies born to Yonkers mothers died at a much higher rate than white babies: 17 black babies died out of 644 live births; while 15 white babies died out of 2,126 live births. Other ethnic categories are included in the total numbers, but Hispanic births are not calculated separately.
The issue revolves around the refusal of private obstetricians to accept Medicaid patients, thus forcing pregnant women to overflow the city's four prenatal clinics; the growth in the number of the poor in the city, and the reduction of the hospitals that will deliver babies here to one: St. John's Riverside.
The other prenatal clinics here are the Yonkers Community Health Center, a satellite of the Mount Vernon Neighborhood Health Center, whose patients are assigned to deliver at Mount Vernon Hospital; Valentine Lane Family Practice, an outreach branch of the Montefiore Medical Center, whose patients are expected to deliver at the North Central Bronx Hospital, and the clinic at St. Joseph's Hospital, which has a delivery arrangement with St. John's.
In fact, said Isabel Tripodi, a registered nurse and the clinical coordinator at St. John's, many of the women who were supposed to deliver at other hospitals wind up at St. John's. That is because St. John's is nearer to their homes, and because ambulances under contract with the city may travel outside its borders only for emergency treatment. St. John's prenatal clinic and obstretical service are both inundated, she said.
The "drop-ins," Mrs. Tripodi noted, present risks to the hospital as well as to themselves, because doctors often have no access to medical information about them. Dr. Shahram S. Razmzan, an obstetrician at St. John's clinic, said the situation especially created problems for women with conditions like diabetes or high blood pressure, who must be carefully monitored during pregnancy and delivery.
Babies born to diabetics can be very large and suffer neurological damage during birth or die from a rapid drop in blood sugar. The babies of women with high blood pressure can be "growth-retarded" the doctor explained.
For these reasons, Mrs. Tripodi emphasized, all women "should be hooked into a system where they can go to deliver."
 
Material Is Bilingual
 The St. John's clinic accepts all patients who meet the income guidelines established by the State Department of Health's Prenatal Care Assistance Program. Patients, who come by appointment, receive comprehensive services that include family planning and nutritional guidance, as well as postpartum care. Educational material is bilingual because of the large Hispanic population.
Mrs. Tripodi said that about 110 patients are seen in the clinic weekly, and that appointments have been booked until July. This meant, she said, that women who sought care at the appropriate time could not be seen until their pregnancies were well advanced.
David Scarpino, the director of finance at St. John's, said the number of babies delivered at St. John's had been about 1,800 for the last eight years, but that those born to clinic patients had risen to 1,000 from 200. He acknowledged there had been talk about closing the prenatal clinic, which loses $750,000 a year, but said such a move was not imminent. Mr. Scarpino explained that each visit cost the hospital $220, while Medicaid's reimbursement fee to the hospital had been frozen at $60 a visit for many years. The clinic pays the four obstetricians on its staff, because St. John's private attending doctors are no longer required to serve the clinic as part of their obligation to the hospital.
Mr. Scarpino said that none of the attending obstetricians would accept Medicaid patients because of the doctors' high malpractice insurance rates and their fear of suits from "high risk" patients. Clinic patients are considered at high risk of having complicated pregnancies because of problems associated with poverty.
 
Resident Status Not Required
 The finance director said the state's Prenatal Care Assistance Program, which has been administered by Medicaid for a year, offered some hope. Under the program, all pregnant women, infants and young children who meet the financial guidelines, regardless of their resident status in this country, are entitled to a complex of health services that are reimbursed at a higher rate than the standard Medicaid visit. But Mr. Scarpino said the hospital had as yet received no payment under the program.
Louis F. Parker, executive director of St. John's, said that while some trustees had raised questions about the clinic, "the consensus of the board is to do all in our power to continue operating" it. But, Mr. Parker said, "If reimbursements decline according to the Governor's proposals, and costs increase and this affects the rest of our mission to provide services and care to the community, then the clinic would have to close."
"Where these people will go is beyond me," Mr. Parker said. "Our fear is they won't go anywhere and they will appear on our doorstep in the emergency room either very ill or without prenatal care."
It is in the interests of a hospital with an obstetrical service to run a prenatal clinic, Mr. Scarpino pointed out, because "most lawsuits hospitals encounter concern babies." If the clinic were closed, he said, the obstetrical service would have to close, too.
 
Doctor Notes a Paradox
 Mrs. Tripodi and Bea Pilkington, director of social work at St. John's, said they have proposed a county-run prenatal clinic in Yonkers to Dr. Mary E. Lane, director of women and youth services for the county's Department of Health. Dr. Lane said that while she recognized the need for expanded services, the Health Department was "not in a position to set up a prenatal clinc."
Dr. Lane noted the paradox of her department's efforts to promote prenatal education, only to have poor women's attempts to seek care thwarted. "The more proselytizing and outreach you do, the more inadequate the services are," she said. The county subsidizes some prenatal clinics and operates a variety of programs for women and children, but runs no prenatal-care service of its own.
Dr. Mark S. Rapoport, the County Health Commissioner, called the shortage of prenatal care for the poor "a tragedy." He asserted that the county was "trying to expand our role as a coordinator of service," but was under "fiscal siege."
"Even in better financial times, this problem has eluded us," Dr. Rapoport said, because of what he called "the fragmented system of health care in this country." Dr. Rapoport said the county was working with hospitals and medical groups as well as with the state "to try to get the private sector to be part of the system."
Anne E. Wright, a family nurse practitioner at the Valentine Lane family practice, calls for "hospitals with a conscience" to require their attending doctors to serve the needs of poor people, particularly pregnant women. She criticized St. John's for not looking at "how to provide services for the people they are going to be delivering."
 
'Communication About Services'
 Ms. Wright said she was working in the March of Dimes Yonkers Campaign for Healthier Babies to "identify the problems" of pregnant women here and "to provide communication about services so people aren't lost between the cracks."
Dr. Lane said that "anything that can be done institutionally is important to help the doctors hang in there."
"They are leaving obstetrics in droves, and they are not taking care of the poor women."
Another solution was "more emphasis on nurse midwifery and birthing centers," Dr. Lane said.
"We need to promote that partnership between the doctor and nurse midwife," she said, "to give enhanced care with counseling that is sustaining, supporting and nurturing to poor women."

HEADLINE: Fresh Air Fund Tells Youths to Study

BYLINE: By ANDREW L. YARROW

 BODY:
Pecuniary interests may have been uppermost in the minds of about 100 poor New York City teen-agers who recently attended the Fresh Air Fund's second-annual Career Day, but all seemed to acknowledge the importance of their counselors' exhortations to stay in school, study hard, stay away from drugs and believe in themselves.
"I'm really interested in I.B.M. because I want to make a lot of money and I like word processing," said Johnny Carey, a 14-year-old from upper Manhattan who had just heard an I.B.M. executive's half-hour introduction to the computer industry. "I like their benefits." 
 Mr. Carey, who said he was applying to Brandeis High School and wanted to go to an Ivy League college, was a member of one of five groups that spent the day in similar sessions learning about careers in health care and art. In addition, the career fair, which was held at Columbia University, included sessions on labor unions and on high schools and colleges.
The day was part of the fund's Career Awareness Program, which was started several years ago "to make a small contribution to the pressing need to do something about youth unemployment," said Jenny Morgenthau, the group's executive director. The initiative also includes a "job shadowing" program, in which teen-agers spend days with architects, lawyers, journalists and other professionals seeing how they work, and a summer Career Awareness Camp, which is scheduled to open in 1993 on the fund's 3,000-acre property near Fishkill, N.Y., about 50 miles north of midtown Manhattan.
 
Free Vacations Since 1877

The fund has provided free summer vacations to more than 1.6 million New York City children and adolescents since 1877, and about 10,000 are expected to attend the fund's bucolic preserve this summer. The group's new $5 million camp will include lodges, an outdoor amphitheater and lakeside playing fields and serve about 300 teen-agers each summer with academic classes and career sessions with professionals.
The key to the program is "to make the link between careers and education, and motivate adolescents to stay in school by letting them explore career options," Ms. Morgenthau said, expressing a sentiment that was echoed many times during the day.
"There's a big difference between a master's degree and working at Wendy's -- and your best offense is education," said Michael Davis, a commercial illustrator who captivated his 12-to-15-year-old audience with his fast-talking, irreverent pitch for the importance of education. Like the other professionals who led the day's career sessions, Mr. Davis described how and why he became an artist and what his working life was like.
"When you think of art, you may think of someone on the street who says, 'I draw what I feel,' " he said mockingly, explaining that his J. C. Penney wardrobe was in keeping with his own philosophy of working hard to maximize his income and minimize his expenses. "It's not about being cool -- it's about business. I don't care if you don't want to be an artist, but you have to learn to read and write."
 
'It Gave Me Real Interest'

Kerensa Smith, a 14-year-old from upper Manhattan, seemed to take Mr. Davis's message to heart. "I've always wanted to draw pictures of people or take pictures," she said. "But when he talked about being an artist, it gave me a real interest in being one."
During a morning session on health care, about 20 teen-agers dressed in their requisite sweatshirts, jeans and sneakers watched a video about the myriad of careers in what was touted as America's fastest growing area of employment. After Carmen Padilla of the nonprofit New York Health Career Center finished extolling the field's virtues, 14-year-old Wilma Vega volunteered: "I want to become an obstetrician, because I like babies. But I learned today that it will be hard, with all the classes I'll have to take."
Many of the teen-agers had done job shadowing and attended the fund's career camp in Fishkill last summer. Ms. Morgenthau said the fund had a commitment "to stay with them for three years to keep encouraging them to stay in school, and then go to college or into the job market."
The practical career advice and the emphasis on education were also repeatedly mixed with a "be all that you can be" message. As Robert Fulton, an official with Local 100 of the Transport Workers Union, told one group: "You have to put it in your mind that you're leaders, not followers."
The fund is a nonprofit agency. Donations may be sent to the Fresh Air fund, 1040 Avenue of the Americas, New York, N.Y. 10018. Information: (212) 221-0900 or (800) 367-0003.

HEADLINE: Scandals Casting Shadows Over Public Life in South Carolina

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: COLUMBIA, S.C.

 BODY:
From its aristocratic beginnings in the great Low Country plantations to the development of what many consider the nation's most powerful state legislature, South Carolina has always been a state accustomed to rule by a few.
Now, after a series of scandals that have touched nearly all the state's power centers -- from the Legislature to its most powerful newspaper, from the former president of the University of South Carolina to the state's most powerful law firm -- South Carolina is looking hard in the mirror and recoiling from what it sees. 
 "Through most of South Carolina's history, the people who set up and ran state government have had two main priorities: Keeping power out of the hands of black people. Keeping power out of the hands of everybody else," began a voluminous package of news articles on May 5 in The State, Columbia's historically docile newspaper.
 
15 Legislators Indicted
 The scandals are diverse. The two most conspicuous ones, a Federal undercover operation that has led to the indictment of 15 state legislators and two indictments against the former state university president, James Holderman, stem from unrelated investigations. But both have helped highlight the degree to which public officials in South Carolina have long been accustomed to extraordinary latitude and minimal oversight in conducting their business. As for the legislators, 10 pleaded guilty, 4 have been found guilty in trials and one is awaiting trial.
"On a scale of democratic institutions, South Carolina is perhaps the least democratic state in the nation," said Charles W. Dunn, a political science professor at Clemson University. "What's happening now is that the old-boy network has been caught in a new-boy vise."
Along with prompting the news articles in The State, the shock waves have given impetus to efforts by Gov. Carroll A. Campbell Jr. to whittle away at the Legislature's power, and have set off a battle over ethics measures in the Legislature.
Skeptics doubt much change will result. But there is little disagreement that South Carolina has been shaken to its political core in the past year.
 
'It Can't Endure Shame'
 "I truly think these are the darkest days for the spirit of South Carolina since the Civil War," said Alex M. Sanders, chief judge of the State Court of Appeals. "For the whole term of its existence, South Carolina has demonstrated that it can endure guilt but it can't endure shame, and shame is where we are today."
South Carolina's culture and politics were shaped by the economics and social structure of its colonial beginnings, when its lordly planters were the richest men in the Colonies. The first English settlers in Charleston set up a rigid class system based on slave labor. What developed was a system that the New Englander Josiah Quincy described as a society divided into "opulent and lordly planters, poor and spiritless peasants and vile slaves."
As the state developed, its beginnings were never wholly forgotten. The Legislature, compared by many to a parliamentary system, is still regarded as the nation's strongest, appointing the state's judges and members of important boards. From the 1930's to the early 1970's the Barnwell Ring, consisting of Edgar A. Brown, the Senate President pro tem, and Solomon Blatt, the House Speaker, both from rural Barnwell County, exercised a degree of power almost unparalleled among the nation's state legislators.
They presided over the state in tandem with the leaders of a relatively monolithic business structure dominated by a few planters, the textile industry and the state's major utilities and banks. As late as 1940 fewer than 100,000 South Carolinians voted in Presidential elections out of nearly one million eligible voters, and the state still has one of the lowest rates of voter participation in the nation.
It was a system that also had some notable achievements. South Carolina integrated more peacefully and with less visible rancor than almost any state in the South. Its relatively placid political environment produced some of the South's most progressive governors, including Ernest F. Hollings, now a United States Senator, Robert McNair, John West and Richard W. Riley.
But it was also a system in which most public policy was made in private, with few brakes on the conduct of those at the top.
"There's a real deference to authority here," said State Senator Michael Rose. "It's like we began with a system of feudal lords who created a hierachical structure, and it's always more or less been that way."
Governor Campbell says the undercover operation, in which legislators took bribes from undercover agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation for support of a parimutuel betting law, reflects the degree to which some of the old ways were dying long before the scandals became public.
 
A Political Transition
 "I think you see a transition in the state," said the Governor, a Republican. "We have gone from a state that, like some others, was dominated by rural barons who operated under their own code and who operated in a nonthreatening society, to a state that now has a competitive two-party system. We had something of an oligarchy down here for a lot of years, and now we're making a transition from it."
Others are less sure how much change is afoot.
"This has always been a state where he who has the gold makes the rules," Mr. Rose said. "That's still the golden rule."
The problems at the state university may be a purer case of how South Carolinahas historically done business.
From his arrival at the university in 1977 to his resignation last May, Mr. Holderman worked the levers of power in South Carolina like a maestro, forging alliances with the state's powers, including the McNair law firm, which is headed by the former Governor. Mr. Holderman's two indictments on charges of tax evasion and use of a public office for private gain stem from a contribution from the firm.
 
Favors and Lavish Gifts
 Mr. Holderman is given credit for drastically upgrading the university. But one way of accomplishing that was by doing favors for and giving lavish gifts to powerful people inside and outside South Carolina.
He personally dispensed $1.6 million in scholarships, many to the children of the state's most prominent residents. He set up an unadvertised student intern program in which some participants, including children of influential South Carolinians, became his personal aides, often joining him on fund-raising expeditions and university-related trips around the country and to Europe and Asia . The program became a steppingstoneto prestigious jobs in the state.
Among his interns were the sons of top executives of The State, which remained an ardent supporter of Mr. Holderman even after other papers, most notably The Charlotte (N.C.) Observer, disclosed his profligate spending. The State, which was purchased from its longtime family ownership by Knight-Ridder Inc. in November 1986, published a long article in March after Mr. Holderman was indicted, taking critical notice of its own ties to the former university president.
"He knew how to utilize the elite structures of the state," said Professor Dunn of Clemson. "He was able to press the right buttons, and there aren't that many to push in an elite, closed system."
Professor Dunn notes that many of the things that once defined South Carolina no longer apply. Once a one-party state, it now has perhaps the strongest Republican Party in the South. Once limited to agriculture and textiles, it has broadened its economic base, with more manufacturing and service concerns. The old rural barons are no longer in control, and the state's news media are more aggressive than they have been in the past.
 
Some Things Remain the Same
 But others say the legacy still plays out in fundamental ways that are more significant then the indictments of legislators. Some blacks contend that the operation was directed disproportionately at black legislators, and some skeptics say legislators on the fringes of power, rather than the center of power, were the ones most affected by the investigation.
Despite economic gains in recent years, South Carolina ranks 42d among the 50 states in per capita income, 49th in life expectancy and near the bottom in many other indices, including infant mortality and illiteracy. It also has one of the nation's largest concentrations of toxic waste dumps, and the economy of the barons' old duchy in Barnwell County is now the preserve of the Savannah River Plant nuclear weapons plant in Aiken.
Tom Turnipseed, a lawyer and former legislator who is active in environmental matters, said the most significant indictment to come out of the F.B.I. investigation did not involve charges of gambling, but rather the indictment of Jack Rogers, a former House Speaker pro tem on charges of taking bribes from Laidlaw Environmental Services Inc., which was seeking a permit for a hazardous waste dump in the state. Laidlow is a major toxic waste collection and disposal company owned by Laidlaw Inc. of Burlington, Ontario. In a plea arrangement Mr. Rogers pleaded guilty to a racketeering charge last Wednesday.
"It's the same old South Carolina story," Mr. Turnipseed said. "There are a few well-situated people who are making a lot of money, and the rest of us are suffering."

CORRECTION-DATE: June 5, 1991, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
An article on May 12 about scandals in South Carolina misstated the link between Laidlaw Environmental Services Inc., a toxic-waste disposal company, and State Representative John I. Rogers 3d. Mr. Rogers was charged with having extorted money from an independent lobbyist who worked on behalf of Laidlaw; Laidlaw was not accused of having paid bribes to Mr. Rogers.

HEADLINE: Making a Difference;
America West's Latest Dogfight

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER

 BODY:
"On this initiative, we've hit the market hard; we are the strongest," said Edward R. Beauvais, founder, chairman and chief executive of America West Airlines, referring to the carrier's announcement last week of steep fare cuts.
Since its founding 10 years ago, America West has built a reputation as one of the last of the scrappy independents, offering full service at precipitous discounts, with such perks as unlimited free drinks. The booze is gone, but last week's move could be the first salvo in a new round of fare wars. 
 The Phoenix-based carrier cut most of its full coach fares by an average of almost 40 percent, touting the discounts in a $20 million ad campaign that casts Jonathan Winters as a Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf lookalike.
Some carriers, like Northwest and Midway, matched the new fares immediately in some markets, but the big three -- American, United and Delta -- said only that they were studying the move.
The guarded response of the giants was just what he expected, Mr. Beauvais said.
"Our cost levels are such that we can make money on these fares," he added, noting that America West has the youngest fleet of fuel-efficient airplanes in the business. In markets where the big three compete only with each other, they maintain high fares, Mr. Beauvais asserted. "It's really important for the industry to have the mavericks to provide a competitive spark," he said.
Though America West accounts for only about 3 percent of the airline industry's capacity, its routes link many major cities, with hubs in both Phoenix and Las Vegas.
Despite its spunk, America West is not immune to the travails of the airline industry as a whole. It reported a first-quarter loss of $49.9 million, compared with a loss of $2.6 million in the comparable period a year ago. Mr. Beauvais said the combination of the gulf war, the recession and soaring fuel prices hurt results, but that business began to recover in March.
A 31-year veteran of the industry, Mr. Beauvais, who is 54, began his career with Frontier Airlines in Colorado as an accountant. Prior to forming America West, he was a principal partner in an air transportation consulting firm from 1970 to 1981.

 BODY:
LEBANON: Death of a Nation, by Sandra Mackey. (Anchor/Doubleday, $12.) Carved out of Syria by the French as a haven for Maronite Christians, Lebanon has always teetered on the brink of self-destruction, Sandra Mackey writes. She makes "the story of Lebanon's morass readable for the uninitiated," Robin Wright said here in 1989. THE FLOATING WORLD, by Cynthia Kadohata. (Ballantine, $4.95.) In the 1950's, Olivia, a 12-year-old Japanese girl, and her family live their life on the road, as they travel through the Pacific Northwest looking for work. "Writing in beautiful, clean yet lyrical prose, Ms. Kadohata creates an emotionally precise picture of each member of Olivia's family," Michiko Kakutani said in The Times in 1989. "Ms. Kadohata does not shirk from examining all the sad, painful details of her family's thwarted lives, but she does so with tenderness, compassion and wit. . . . 'The Floating World' marks the debut of a luminous new voice in fiction."
 INSIDE JOB: The Looting of America's Savings and Loans, by Stephen Pizzo, Mary Fricker and Paul Muolo. (Harper Perennial, $10.95.) In the olden days, the Government's willingness to guarantee the deposits in the savings and loan industry was backed by a quid pro quo: there were strict regulations on how the money could be invested. Then the Reagan Administration deregulated the industry. In documenting the disastrous aftermath, the authors "have put together a chilling account, cast almost in cinematic terms, of greed and criminality," Anthony M. Solomon said here in 1989. In THE BIG FIX. Inside the S&L Scandal: How an Unholy Alliance of Politics and Money Destroyed America's Banking System (John Wiley & Sons, $12.95), James Ring Adams shows how the financial industry, the regulators and Congress were all to blame for the mess. He provides "a front-row seat at a three-ring circus," Karen W. Arenson said here in 1989. 
THE MUSIC ROOM, by Dennis McFarland. (Avon, $8.95.) Just as he is trying to adjust to the fact that his wife has left him, Martin Lambert learns that his brother has followed in their father's footsteps and committed suicide. "What is most magical about 'The Music Room' is its fabric: thick, rich, mysterious, true," Josephine Humphreys said here last year. "Constructed like a detective story (an unexplained death, a detective, clues to a buried past) and pressing forward with the detective story's speed, it is nevertheless an opposite of that genre. Instead of narrowing to a solution, it opens onto territory unforeseen, and revelations larger than those that might have been expected."
 CLEOPATRA: Histories, Dreams and Distortions, by Lucy Hughes-Hallett. (Harper Perennial, $10.95.) The myth of Cleopatra as the evil seductress that has come down through the ages began as part of a propaganda campaign by Antony's rival Octavian. Last year The Times's Michiko Kakutani said that in making this argument, Lucy Hughes-Hallett has produced "a well-researched and highly informative volume -- an often fascinating examination of the way history and historical figures are subjected to a continuing process of reimagination." CONSTANCIA: And Other Stories for Virgins, by Carlos Fuentes. Translated by Thomas Christensen. (Harper Perennial, $10.95.) In one of these obscure short stories, a student decides to kill a mannequin because she refuses to return his love. Last year our reviewer, Denis Donoghue, said each of these five fictions is "bizarre, a tale lingered over by the teller to the point at which, if he were to stay with it a moment longer, he would have to explain everything, and ruin it."
 THE SUN ALSO SETS: The Limits to Japan's Economic Power, by Bill Emmott. (Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $10.95.) A British journalist says that Japan's economic power can't last forever. In 1989 our reviewer, Joel Dreyfuss, said, "For those who worry about drowning in a sea of yen, 'The Sun Also Sets' is a fragile lifeline, offering hope that Japan will begin to behave like other nations and expose its problems, shortcomings and mistakes."
 MOTHERLAND, by Timothy O'Grady. (Anchor/Dou bleday, $9.) A middle-aged man returns to his flat in Dublin to find that his mother has disappeared, leaving behind a dead turtle, a live monkey and a collection of ancient manuscripts. Last year our reviewer, Annabel Davis-Goff, complimented the author on his "fine sense of image" and the book for its "evocative scenes." FAMILY PORTRAITS: Remembrances by Twenty Distinguished Writers, edited by Carolyn Anthony. (Penguin, $9.95.) Twenty writers, including Walker Percy, Margaret Atwood, Gloria Steinem and Joyce Carol Oates, tell how their lives were shaped by their families. "Every reader will find a favorite family in 'Family Portraits,' " Jill Ker Conway said here in 1989. "Most will ponder the skill with which such complex human relationships are brought to life in prose."
 THE HORSE LATITUDES, by Robert Ferrigno. (Avon, $5.95.) An archeologist and former drug dealer named Danny DiMedici is suspected of murder when his ex-wife disappears from her southern California beach house. "Mr. Ferrigno has concocted a striking if lurid poetry of violence," Christopher Lehmann-Haupt said in The Times last year. Most readers will enjoy "the violent, darkly comic and strangely haunting voyage that Mr. Ferrigno has taken them on."
 STARDUST, by Robert B. Parker. (Berkley, $5.50.) Spenser, the Boston private eye and gourmand, is hired to find out who is stalking Jill Joyce, a beautiful if self-centered television star. Last year our reviewer, Richard Gid Powers, called the novel "classic Spenser, the tough guy who knows his tofu from his tacos."

HEADLINE: Political Talk

BYLINE: By Kevin Sack

 BODY:
New Way to Run
In the old days, candidates announced their plans to run for office and then set about to assemble their staffs. But for today's politicians, who like to act like candidates while remaining coy about their intentions, the old ways no longer suffice. 
 So it is for the New York City Comptroller, Elizabeth Holtzman, who will not yet say that she plans to run for the United States Senate but has already hired a poll taker and a media consultant.
 "If and when she makes a decision, she'll have a strong team," an aide said,
 Perhaps because she was elected to her citywide post less than two years ago, Ms. Holtzman has been reluctant to disclose her ambitions too quickly. But those she has hired -- the poll taker Paul Maslin and the media consulting firm of Squier Eskew Knapp Communications -- think there is only the slightest chance she will not run in next year's Democratic primary.
 Mr. Maslin, who has offices in New York City and Los Angeles, worked for Ms. Holtzman in her 1989 comptroller's race. Robert Squier and Carter Eskew, two of Washington's best-known Democratic consultants, met while working in her 1980 Senate campaign.
 If Ms. Holtzman joins Attorney General Robert Abrams, former Vice Presidential nominee Geraldine A. Ferraro and Representative Robert J. Mrazek, all of whom have said they will run, the 1992 Democratic primary could be one of the most interesting statewide races in years. The Democrats hope to unseat Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, the Long Island Republican being investigated by the Senate Ethics Committee.
 
Decisions a la Jersey
 There was plenty of cynicism when Gov. Jim Florio announced recently that New Jersey would sell a stretch of Interstate 95 to the state's Turnpike Authority for $400 million to help balance its budget. Given that Mr. Florio had recently approved a major turnpike toll increase, which now will finance the interstate purchase, drivers felt they were being asked to shoulder an unfair burden.
 Now the cynicism is growing with the announcement that the Turnpike Authority has hired the law firm that employs the brother of the State Senate President, John A. Lynch, to act as counsel on a $2.5 billion bond refinancing. The refinancing will help generate the $400 million needed for the highway purchase.
 Republican legislators, who hope to wrest control of both houses from the Democrats this year, are charging nepotism.
 The Senate minority leader, John H. Dorsey, who estimates that the refinancing could generate up to $1 million in bond counsel fees, said he would be interested in learning what attracted the authority to the Philadelphia firm of Morgan, Lewis and Bockius. William J. Lynch, the Senator's brother, is a partner in the firm's New York office.
 Mr. Dorsey said that while Morgan, Lewis and Bockius is a prestigious firm, its relative lack of experience in bond work made its selection "extraordinary."
 Senator Lynch has denied knowing anything about the hiring decision. Clive Cummis, the authority's lawyer, said William Lynch's membership in the firm had nothing to do with his decision to recommend it.
 
Little Matilda Sunshine
 Sounding much like Ronald Reagan tweaking the Democrats, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo set out this week to show "the doom and gloom people" that New York City remained strong and would triumph over its fiscal adversities.
 On the same day that Mr. Dinkins, in a televised speech, told of "our difficult journey ahead" and a "grinding financial squeeze," Mr. Cuomo said in a speech that "we ought to provide more energy on the positive side." To that end, he announced -- first to The New York Post gossip columnist Cindy Adams -- that he plans to dispatch his wife, Matilda, as an ambassador of optimism.
 In fact, Mrs. Cuomo has played a similar role for many years, representing her husband on economic development missions to China, Japan, Italy, Spain and Hong Kong. But the Governor seems to feel that the state and city budget problems call for an accelerated campaign against the forces of negativism.
 Mrs. Cuomo's itinerary, which will be coordinated by the State Department of Economic Development, will begin with a daunting challenge. On June 4, she and other state officials will try to sell foreign diplomats, business executives and reporters on investment opportunities in the Bronx.
 
Hot Cakes and Messages
 Stanley Hill, the executive director of District Council 37 of the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees, is not the only New York City labor leader to emulate the rhetorical style of Yogi Berra. But Mr. Hill does demonstrate a special flair.
 In explaining recently that his members were disturbed by an erroneous news report about contract negotiations, Mr. Hill said, "My members have been calling up like hot cakes."
 With the city's fiscal problems shining a spotlight on the unions, Mr. Hill has retained the Kamber Group, a Washington-based public relations firm, "to help out during the crisis."
 In reacting to Mayor David N. Dinkins's demands for union concessions, Mr. Hill often has been eclipsed by Barry Feinstein, the colorful, quotable and perpetually outraged president of Local 237 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. With 20,000 members, Mr. Feinstein's union is far smaller than Mr. Hill's 140,000-member group.
 Deborah H. Friedman, who is handling Mr. Hill's account for Kamber, said she hopes to help Mr. Hill press his case. "When you represent so many people, and everybody else is getting their message out, and labor's going to be asked for sacrifices, you want people to know that your members work in the libraries and clean the parks," she said.

HEADLINE: States Using Donations to Get Medicaid Money

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 11 --

 BODY:
Faced with soaring medical costs, states have devised a way to extract money from the Federal Government to pay for health care of poor people under Medicaid.
 Bush Administration officials say the fund-raising technique is a scam that costs the Government more than a billion dollars a year, and they are trying to halt its use. But state officials say it is a legitimate way to finance expanded medical care for millions of women and children in low-income families mandated under recently passed Federal laws -- at no cost to state treasuries. 
 The device works this way: States collect "voluntary donations" from hospitals, count these contributions as part of the state share of Medicaid and then get $2 or $3 of Federal matching money for each dollar donated by the hospitals. Hospitals go along with the arrangement because when the Medicaid funds are paid out, they usually get back more money than they donated.
 
A Way to Pay Rising Costs
 Today, as for the last 25 years, general revenues are the main source of state Medicaid funds. But the hospital contributions have become increasingly important as states try to cope with the program's soaring costs in the midst of a recession that has depleted their revenues.
 Those donations and the related Federal payments finance health care for many pregnant women, new mothers and infants enrolled in Medicaid. Even though the Bush Administration says it wants to reduce infant mortality, it has drafted rules to end Federal matching payments for donations.
 "Without these options, there is no doubt that the Medicaid program in Tennessee, after making great progress in recent years, would be forced to reduce benefits and services," said Norman B. Urmy, executive director of the Vanderbilt University Hospital in Nashville. Officials in other states expressed identical concerns.
Although Administration officials describe the hospital donations as a device invented by states to siphon money from the Federal Treasury, Federal courts have upheld the legitimacy of the technique, and Congress has explicitly allowed it to continue.
 
In Lieu of New Taxes
 Senator Wyche Fowler Jr., Democrat of Georgia, said states must be allowed to use "creative methods of financing Medicaid in these tough budget times, when health-care costs are skyrocketing and the Federal Government keeps setting new mandates" for the program. "I would much rather see a system of voluntary contributions from hospitals than the tax increases that might otherwise be needed," he said.
 The fiscal condition of states is worse than at any time in the last decade, says the National Governors' Association. But state officials are reluctant to raise taxes, reading last year's election results as an overwhelming vote against new broad-based taxes.
 Senator Bob Graham, Democrat of Florida, warned that "states will have to cut already insufficient benefits and reimbursement" if the Administration succeeds in restricting the use of donations and special assessments from hospitals.
 A nationwide survey shows that eight states already accept donations from hospitals, for the specific purpose of getting more money from Washington for Medicaid, and 12 other states are considering such programs. A similar device -- a special state assessment on hospitals, used to get more Federal dollars for Medicaid -- has been adopted in nine states and is under consideration in 13 more.
 
Federal Objections
 The Department of Health and Human Services and the White House Office of Management and Budget object to both arrangements, saying they "unfairly increase the Federal share of Medicaid payments," distort the "Federal-state financial partnership" and permit states to finance expansion of Medicaid "with 100 percent Federal monies."
But state officials say the Administration's proposal to stop matching the hospital donations would violate the principle of federalism and usurp their authority to decide how best to raise money.
 Nationwide, Medicaid finances health care for 27 million Americans, including 13 million children. States together pay about 45 percent of the program's total cost of more than $90 billion this year. The state share rises with a state's per capita income and ranges from 20 percent in the poorest state, Mississippi, to 50 percent in the most affluent states.
 Georgia uses $35.5 million of hospital contributions to get $57 million from the Federal Government. Russell B. Toal, the state Medicaid director, said, "We are using the money for precisely the kinds of services that Congress and the Administration want: expanded eligibility for children, case management of prenatal care, home visits to new mothers and payments to hospitals that carry the burden of indigent care."
 
Helping Themselves by Donating
 While initially skeptical, hospital executives have come to appreciate the value of donating. W. Hoke Kerns, president of the Alabama Hospital Association, said: "Being able to generate additional revenue through voluntary contributions has enabled some of our rural hospitals to remain open. Otherwise they would have to close their doors because there is insufficient revenue to keep them open."
 In Alabama this year, 24 hospitals are contributing $108 million to the state, which uses that money to obtain $288 million from the Federal Government. The state distributes the entire sum, $396 million, to hospitals, favoring those with disproportionately large numbers of low-income patients.
 "We contribute to our own well-being," said Terry J. Smith, administrator of Bibb Medical Center, a 35-bed hospital in Centreville, Ala., that donates $8,000 a month to the state and gets back $16,000 a month for a net gain of $8,000.
 Manly E. White, acting administrator of the Perry County Hospital and Nursing Home in Marion, Ala., said the voluntary contributions program was "a godsend" for many health-care providers. "It makes the difference between surviving and not surviving," he said.
 
How Transactions Work
 When hospitals donate to a state, they typically take the money from their general operating revenues. The donations are not just paper transactions; hospitals make actual cash contributions. While there may be a lag at first, the hospitals are eventually paid by state Medicaid programs at regular monthly or quarterly intervals.
 While there is no legal limit on the donation amounts, hospital executives and members of Congress agree that donations should not exceed 10 percent of a hospital's gross revenues or 10 percent of a state's Medicaid spending.
 States discovered the value of this fund-raising technique when they found that they had too little money to pay their share of Medicaid costs, creating a backlog of unpaid claims.
 Missouri is using $88 million in donated funds to obtain more than $131 million from the Federal Government. "In light of the multiple Federal mandates placed on state Medicaid programs in the last few years, I have every right to be as creative as I can in paying for the program," said Donna E. Checkett, director of Missouri's Medicaid program.
 In California, Sally Lee, chief of Medicaid operations, said the state had raised $147 million in voluntary contributions from hospitals and had obtained an equal amount in Federal matching funds. The money, she said, "keeps hospitals in business and improves access to medical care for the indigent."
 
Paying the State's Share
 In some states, hospitals contribute to Medicaid by paying part of the salaries of state or county employees who certify people as eligible for Medicaid. Salaries are considered an administrative cost. The Federal Government normally pays half of such administrative costs, with the expectation that states will pay the remainder.
 However, in South Carolina, Missouri, Texas and several other states, hospitals pay the state's share of salary costs for eligibility workers assigned to hospitals to review Medicaid applications. The hospitals benefit because Medicaid pays many hospital bills that would otherwise go unpaid. Medicaid recipients often have neither private insurance nor the means to pay their own bills.
 Thus, for example, South Carolina hospitals are contributing $2.3 million to the state's Department of Social Services to pay for 168 state employees who check eligibility for Medicaid. The Federal Government gives the state an equal amount for the salaries of those workers.
 The eight states that accept donations to secure Federal matching funds are Alabama, California, Georgia, Massachusetts, Missouri, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas. States that have been coonsidering such arrangements are Colorado, Florida, Indiana, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Utah and West Virginia.

HEADLINE: Small Businesses Win Growth Awards

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER

 BODY:
WHEN the "white tablecloth" restaurants in Manhattan that flourished during the 1980's started to wither and die in the 90's, the future of the Westchester Restaurant Supply Company in Elmsford was threatened.
"Fifty percent of our business in the 80's came from upscale restaurants in Manhattan," said Richard Ross, owner of the company, which has been supplying restaurant china, glassware, silverware and cookware since 1927. 
 Mr. Ross and his partner, Stephen Birnbaum, who bought the company from its original owners in the late 70's, decided last year to expand their market and seek new customers.
Mainly, the partners turned their sights northeast. Formerly distributing no further east than Fairfield County, they now consider all of New England part of their territory.
"We also expanded our customer base by promoting walk-in trade," Mr. Ross said, "encouraging small restaurant owners, school and church representatives and the public, who want such items as quality cookware, coffee urns and restaurant-quality china."
The company's marketing efforts have been successful, Mr. Ross noted. In late February, sales began to turn up again and have continued to increase. "We've managed to achieve a pattern of growth every year for the past five years," he said.
Such growth is one reason that Westchester Restaurant Supply was recently named a "Westchester Winner" in the sixth yearly event recognizing 18 of Westchester's fastest-growing small companies. In order to qualify, each company had to be an independent business at least five years old, with 1990 sales of $150,000 to $25 million.
Ira Bratt, chairman of the Westchester Small Business Council, an affiliate of the County Chamber of Commerce that sponsors the contest, said this year's awards are particularly signficant.
 
'They Faced All the Problems'
 "These businesses are to be commended," Mr. Bratt said, "because, despite the recession, marked by vacant stores and unrented office space and increased business failures, winners this year have somehow managed to achieve consistent business success. This year, they faced all the problems always inherent in operating a successful company, compounded by the difficult economic climate."
The award winners, several of whose profiles follow, include two limousine concerns, several publishers, engineering firms, interior designers and suppliers of home care.
"Small-business owners create economic opportunities and employ more people than their larger counterparts," Mr. Bratt said. "They also take the biggest risks. But it's the growing small company that provides increased employment in a community. And that is why we like to give them some recognition."
 
'Repeat Business Is the Lifeblood'
 One such example is Excell Limousine Service in Mount Vernon.
Starting with two cars, bought in 1983 with a small stake provided by his grandmother, 32-year-old Richard J. Guberti, Excell's owner, now runs 25 limousines and employs 45 people.
Pointing out that cash flow and marketing are challenges a small service company such as his faces daily, Mr. Guberti said the growth of his company was based on service and a continuing marketing program.
"Repeat business is the lifeblood of our company," he said. "We try to make sure that once we get a customer, we keep him, by providing him with 24-hour-a-day service. I market the company aggressively and go around the country speaking to groups about limousine service."
One such appearance, he noted, resulted in a large order for limousines from the French Government. "They used us last fall to escort French President Mitterrand from the airport to the United Nations," Mr. Guberti said.
 
Publisher Branches Out
 The current challenge facing M. E. Sharpe Publishing in Armonk, publishers of books and social science journals, said its owner, Myron Sharpe, is finding a way the 33-year-old publishing company can grow when its major customers, college and university libraries, are restricted by tight budgets.
"We have been pioneers in translating social science journals from foreign languages, namely Chinese, Japanese and Russian, into English," Mr. Sharpe said. The company's work spans the fields of economics, political science, sociology and history as well as area studies of Europe, the Soviet Union, China and Japan, among others.
In addition to the company's four full-time translators, Mr. Sharpe said, M. E. Sharpe also uses the services of part-time translators and 150 free-lance proofreaders around the world.
The company's solution to the falloff in library orders, Mr. Sharpe said, has been to increase the number of trade books it sells to bookstores. "We're publishing more books, 100 new titles this year, notably in academic fields where we are well known," he said. "And they have generated a lot of new business for us."
 
A Tea Importer Who Adapted
 Despite market changes that mean fewer customers for its products, Kentea Ltd., a tea-importing concern in New Rochelle, founded in 1977, has managed to generate growth.
"Tea importing is a highly specialized business," said Kentea's president, Kentaro Ikeda, who came to this country from his native Japan in 1938. "It's a relatively small business, since Americans use only 187 million pounds of tea a year. But we have been in the business so many years -- I have been in it for 40 -- that we have earned a good reputation, which has helped us."
When Mr. Ikeda began in the tea business, he said, he had hundreds of potential customers in the early 1950's.
"The problem is that now, the number of buyers has dwindled to less than a dozen," he said, "Only the very big companies are left. We have managed because we have established good relationships over the years, and we are able to sell volume amounts at a very competitive price."
But, Mr. Ikeda continued, in order to insure his company's future growth, Kentea plans to import related items, such as speciality coffees, and to explore other products for possible export.
 
Abreast of New Technology
 Robert Schads, president of Signacon Controls in Mamaroneck, a company that designs fire, safety and security systems for industrial and commercial customers, has been in business for 25 years.
"In order to stay on the forefront of the industry, we have expanded over and over again through the years," Mr. Schads said.
"As technology becomes more sophisticated," he said, "the systems we design must integrate a wide variety of state-of-the-art equipment. We are already offering customers such things as fingerprint readers and biometric systems. That's the reason for our growth."

HEADLINE: Windsor Knot

BYLINE: By Christopher Hitchens; Christopher Hitchens, a columnist for The Nation, is the author of "The Monarchy: A Critique of Britain's Favorite Fetish" and "Blood, Class and Nostalgia: Anglo-American Ironies."

 BODY:
In a 1957 essay, the English novelist and playwright J. B. Priestley lamented Britain's decline into an offshore province of the new American empire. Perhaps surprisingly for such a man-of-the people author, he wrote: "That is why we are so happy and excited when we can send abroad a good-looking young woman in a pretty new dress to represent us, playing the only card we feel can take a trick -- the Queen."
The years have moved on, and the Queen's dressmaker has made very little attempt to keep up with fashion, but the point still holds. No longer a great exporting nation, the British adore sending their sovereign overseas as a symbol of national unity and grandeur. When Her Majesty arrives on a state visit to America this week, she comes not just to set the seal on cooperation between Desert Rats and United States marines in the Persian Gulf and to signal the enduring nature of the "special relationship" between the two English-speaking peoples, but to reassure the "subjects" that she leaves behind. In Washington and in the bloodstock country around Lexington, Ky., she and her husband and retinue will demonstrate the sturdy, enduring qualities of duty and lineage. 
 The visit will also be a holiday from the cares and trials that increasingly beset her court in London, where each week brings rumors of marital stress, of tension over the succession, even of abdication. The essential strength of the House of Windsor reposes in its image as a family: the pattern of order in society and the microcosm of the domestic ideal. Yet it is precisely as a family that the Windsors are beginning to fray. Without even looking for skeletons in the closet, it is possible to find them thrust in one's face in the most alarming way.
Consider, for example, the most popular member of the British royal family -- certainly the most popular after the Queen herself -- Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother. Born with the century in 1900, she was Queen during the years of the Nazi bombardment of London, when the royal decision to "stay on" through the blitz won so many hearts. And her stoic example also helped the House of Windsor to overcome the deep trauma that was occasioned by the abdication crisis of 1936, when Edward VIII decided that he preferred the company of an American divorcee to the grand responsibility of being King and Emperor.
The usual, if not, indeed, the inevitable word in newspaper descriptions of the Queen Mum, as she is affectionately known to the populace, is "radiant." She fulfils every expectation of a national grandma. Only once has she ever been publicly criticized. This was when, in 1987, a challenge was made to her position as chief patron of the Royal Society for Mentally Handicapped Children and Adults (Mencap). The challenge came when it was disclosed that two of the Queen Mother's nieces -- cousins to the Queen -- had been secretly incarcerated in a mental hospital, listed as dead and written out of the official handbooks of the British nobility.
Katherine and Nerissa Bowes-Lyon were confined in the Royal Earlswood Hospital in 1941, and their deaths announced in Burke's Peerage, the bible of British pedigree and genealogy, in 1963. Nerissa did not, in fact, die until 1986, and Katherine was still alive at the time that the grisly discovery of the forgotten sisters was made. Since Mencap existed partly to prevent ordinary families from "dumping" their retarded members and since the Queen Mother was found to have knowledge of the guilty secret in her own family, there was a row of sorts. But it soon blew over. A picture so much at odds with the prevailing and necessary one -- whereby the royal family is not just a model family in itself but a reinforcement of the idea that the British are a family -- could not be assimilated into the general consciousness. Mention the incarceration and airbrushing of the Bowes-Lyon sisters today, and most British people will look blankly at you. Mention the Queen Mother, however, and the word "radiant" will come easily to the lips as they affirm that she does "a marvelous job."
The history of British monarchy is, of course, replete with wives going to the block, princes smothered in the Tower, inconvenient pretenders spitted and burned. In Britain, reminders of this questionable past are everywhere about. On every coin is a picture of the Queen and the Latin abbreviation F. D., standing for "Fidei Defensor" or "Defender of the Faith." This title, right on the money, makes her head of the Church of England (a state church that does not permit female priests) and descends directly from the lecherous Henry VIII's schism with Rome over his hectic search for a divorce.
The hereditary principle is a peculiar thing. The laws of nature insure that it will throw up reprobates, incompetents, villains and madmen, of the sort that make the works of William Shakespeare imperishable. Yet by some alchemy, a principle so vulnerable to disaster is also the guarantee of tradition, continuity, breeding and other English hallmarks.
Subliminal association with English history and valor can make opposition to the throne seem almost akin to self-hatred. The British do not argue for their monarchy, or attempt to rationalize it. For most of them, it just is, and they affirm it with the same relish as some early church fathers affirmed the Trinity -- "Credo quia absurdum," I believe because it is absurd.
YET ON THE DAY I ARRIVED IN LONDON TO begin my re-examination of this durable absurdity, the front page of Rupert Murdoch's tabloid Sun was consumed by one giant headline. "SEPARATE HOMES," it bellowed, trumpeting the true confessions of Andrew Jacques, a police guard at Prince Charles's country estate of Highgrove. Jacques claimed that a glacial silence had descended upon the home, punctuated only by shouting matches, and that Princess Diana spent almost all her time at Kensington Palace in London. Separate rooms were the rule when the couple did meet, and the Prince spent all his waking time in a walled vegetable garden.
This looked grim. In another newspaper the same morning, I read that Capt. Mark Phillips, the recently separated husband of Charles's sister, Princess Anne, had been served with a paternity suit by a woman living in New Zealand. Princess Anne herself was reported to be having a romance with a young naval officer. And in yet another Fleet Street sheet was a lavish photo spread showing the three recent occasions when the Duchess of York -- nee Sarah Ferguson and known to all as Fergie -- had had her dresses blown above her knees by the wind on state occasions. Things had reached such a pass that Prince Charles complained (and on a French television station at that) about his family being turned into "a soap opera."
For a take on all this, I telephoned my old acquaintance Nigel Dempster, who does the royal-watch column for The Daily Mail and is regarded as the doyen of the Fleet Street society writers. "Take my advice, dear boy," he said. "Get hold of a picture of Prince Andrew" -- Fergie's husband -- "and then one of Lord Porchester at the same age. You'll see that Prince Philip could never have been Andy's father." Lord Porchester is the Queen's racing manager and tends her beloved stable of winners. He is a grandson of the Earl of Carnarvon, who opened King Tutankhamen's tomb with Howard Carter. "If you mention this," said the assiduous Dempster (who first broke the story that Margaret was the second Mrs. Thatcher), "I want full attribution."
The following morning, an angry Buckingham Palace aide, denouncing the Sun story of the previous day, told the rival newspaper Today that Charles and Diana spent at least three nights a week together -- as embarrassing a claim in its way as the earlier public one made by Diana's father, Lord Spencer, that she was "virgo intacta" on her wedding night. The same paper loyally reported that Princess Diana had given Charles a special lamp as a Christmas present, so that he could carry on his gardening after dark. In view of the repeated story that Charles likes to talk to plants and shrubs, how reassuring was this supposed to be?
What, in fact, was going on? Like poor old Tutankhamen, the royal family seemed violated and profaned, prey to every sort of vulgar gaze and speculation. Was nothing sacred? Where was the fabled mystique and reserve? I had left Washington in the clutches of Kitty Kelley fever. Had the virus crossed the Atlantic ahead of me?
SEEKING AN ANSWER, I WENT TO CALL ON Philip Ziegler, the distinguished historian and biographer. Author of "Crown and People," a study of British attitudes to the royal family, he is also one of the very few scholars permitted access to the Royal Archives at Windsor. His acclaimed 1990 biography of King Edward VIII was "authorized" by the present Queen and dealt candidly with the striking and unsettling fact of Edward's open sympathy, before, during and after the Second World War, for Adolf Hitler. (The subject of royalism and fascism is another of those topics considered too awkward for everyday discussion; one of the very few times that the Queen has had to face a political demonstration was in 1963, when she played host to then-Queen Frederika of Greece, the favorite cousin of Prince Philip and a noted pre-war Axis sympathizer.)
Ziegler received me in the ideal surroundings of his gentleman's club in St. James's, just across from the royal palace of that name. We talked about the scandal and sensation that infested royal coverage these days, and I asked him whether he thought that the monarchy, once the symbol of rectitude, had now become a generator of vulgarity. "Look, there's always been a problem with irresponsible behavior on the part of fringe members of the royal family," he said. "And I suppose there always will be. But it's a mistake to confuse public alarm at this with resentment of the monarchy itself. At the time of the abdication, several members of the royal family thought the game was up, for example, and there was a lot of disillusionment. But then along comes a jubilee or a royal marriage or some occasion of national unity and rejoicing, and everybody rallies round again."
Ziegler gave the example of King George V's Silver Jubilee in 1935, when, after a rapturous reception in London's East End slums, the old King remarked: "I'd no idea they felt like that about me. I'm beginning to think they must like me for myself." (This same King George, reading an article in The Times by H. G. Wells that called for a republic and for the end of "an alien and uninspiring court," grunted, "I may be uninspiring, but I'll be damned if I'm alien.")
"Now," Ziegler said, "if She or He showed any signs of vulgarity or irresponsibility, that'd be a very different matter." (I knew before he went on that the mentally capitalized pronouns meant the sovereign herself and the heir to her throne.) "But neither the Queen nor the Prince of Wales appears to be anything but extremely thoughtful and conscientious. In fact, the Queen really embodies the bourgeois virtues rather than the aristocratic ones -- dutiful, family-minded, respectable, hard-working -- and these values appeal to people. Prince Charles also seems a very serious and sober young man -- actually middle-aged man -- and though the press these days is much more efficient and much less scrupulous, it hasn't been able to find more than a few eccentricities in him."
I tried on Ziegler my theory that the hereditary principle is a rather chancy way of selecting a head of state, and that if you're going to claim credit for the sound ones you have to take responsibility for the nutty or corrupt ones as well. He employed the traditional defense: "It's still better than the alternatives. It avoids the ghastliness of finding some superannuated politician to be President every four years or so."
Still, considerable sentiment is generated, especially in times of high unemployment and hardship, by the extravagance of the royal style. The House of Windsor costs the taxpayers $101.5 million each year, almost half of which goes in staffing and maintaining no fewer than five royal palaces. And this hefty sum is a state supplement and subsidy to an astonishing private fortune in land, real estate, stock and art treasures. Fortune magazine recently estimated the private wealth of the Windsors, in everything from picture collections and priceless stamps to shares and jewelry, at $10.73 billion. And on the income of this immense wealth, no income tax is paid: a sore point in a country that very recently saw flaming streets and shattered windows in riots over the hated poll tax.
There's another point, hard to ignore: There are so many of them. Prince Andrew gets $481,000 per annum in expenses for his "official duties." Prince Edward receives $186,000. Princess Margaret, the Queen's divorced socialite sister, pulls in $423,000. Princess Anne, the Queen's daughter, gets $441,000. And it goes on. And all of these, except for the persistently unmarried and rumor-haunted Prince Edward, have children (one ultraloyalist glossy magazine in London deals only with the subject of royal offspring). As a consequence, given the ravenous appetite of the press and the public for royal trivia, England often seems like some princeling-infested Ruritanian theme park.
"Yes, it was all more restrained during the last reign," Philip Zeigler admits. "Then there was just the King and Queen and the two little princesses. Now it's high jinks all over the place, and Viscount Althorp can't even visit a tart in Paris without provoking a storm because he's Princess Diana's brother."
Increasingly, the smooth managers of the Buckingham Palace press office are relying on television to communicate with the public, giving up the press as a bad job (as some of the press is giving up on it: The Independent is said to have a standing order that no more than a dozen "royal stories" a year may appear in its pages). "There is much more control available when it comes to TV," a royal-coverage professional says, "and it is much less easy to spot. The key thing is that the palace can control access and film rights like a tap and can demand editing privileges before anything sees the screen. Ziegler blames the avid press for this state of affairs. But it's also clear that the journalists have more to work with these days.
During the gulf crisis, there was a colossal row over the way the royals fiddled while Kuwait burned. In a huge, indignant editorial on Feb. 10, The Sunday Times intoned piously about the sacrifice of British servicemen in the gulf while, "on the home front, too many of the young royals and their entourages carry on regardless with their peacetime life styles, parading a mixture of upper-class decadence and insensitivity which disgusts the public and demeans the monarchy."
The up-market newspaper, which represents the respectable end of Rupert Murdoch's empire and often editorializes as if it did not share offices with The Sun, is edited by Andrew Neil. Neil once told me that he represents "the new Britain" -- essentially classless or at least meritocratic, with an American approach to politics and business. He makes a practice of ridiculing royal excess and anomaly -- something that no middle-class newspaper would have dared to do until recently, and would still not dare to do unless there were sales in it. On this occasion, he even attacked the heir to the throne, saying: "The Duke of Edinburgh and the Prince of Wales have taken up arms, but only to go hunting birds. Not even war, it seems, can stop the last shoot of the season at Sandringham."
The editorial undoubtedly had the desired effect. Within 24 hours, Prince Charles and Princess Diana were visiting naval families at Plymouth, and "Fergie," the Duchess of York (attacked in the editorial for "playing with her gang, very publicly, at a high-spirited dinner in a London restaurant") was preparing to do the same at a naval air station. In addition to being the head of state and the head of the church, the Queen is also the head of the armed forces -- the only colonel in the British army, in fact, to be married to another colonel -- and on the eve of the ground war a few days later she made a very rare television broadcast to invoke the protection of God on the British troops. Yet in a previous generation, the identification of the monarchy with gut patriotism, empire and the martial virtues was so close as to be unquestionable, and no such hurried or improvised gestures would have been expected or demanded.
There are limits, though, and Neil understands them. Some weeks after his editorial had provoked the storm, The Sunday Times gave its annual literary awards dinner at the Grosvenor House Hotel. Before the ceremonies began, Neil rose, glass in hand, and proposed "The Loyal Toast" to Her Majesty. This toast must be drunk standing up. Joan Smith, the feminist critic and novelist, kept to her seat. "People kept hissing at me to stand up," Smith says, "but I stayed in my chair. And then someone pulled my chair away so I had no choice. It was one of the servants, of course." There will, as people never tire of saying, always be an England.
But is England getting value for its money? Royalists have a threefold reply. First, and usually slightly sotto voce, is the argument that the monarchy isn't like the rest of us and it's silly to pretend that it is or wish that it were or what would be the point of it? Second is the undoubted fact that revenue from the Crown Estate (which, for example, controls all land beneath territorial waters and all mineral rights except hydrocarbons) goes direct to the Treasury. Third is the claim -- put forward with some diffidence because it smacks of tacky commercialism -- that the royals are a magnet for Britain's lucrative tourist industry.
Ziegler disdains to make the tourist-industry defense because he thinks the monarchy is worth every penny. "It's a proven success over many centuries," he argues. "It's a guarantee of political stability. It gives the Prime Minister of the day a chance to talk to at least one adviser and confidante he can be certain isn't after his job. It's very well loved by the British people, who identify their national pride and unity with it. And it costs less than the British Embassy in Washington." Really? "So I've always been told," he says stoutly.
There is a problem with the elegant Ziegler defense: He makes it all somehow appear like a sound business and constitutional proposition, built to human scale. Yet the idea of English monarchy is inextricably linked with the notion of magic and charisma -- something that mortals find it hard to come by. And every revelation of human frailty, from the walled-up cousins of the Queen to the marital difficulties of her progeny, tends to derogate from this aura of majesty and mystery. As Walter Bagehot, one-time editor of The Economist and author of "The English Constitution," wrote on this ticklish subject: "Above all things our royalty is to be reverenced, and if you begin to poke about it you cannot reverence it. . . . Its mystery is its life. We must not let in daylight upon magic."
AS SHE PREPARED for her visit to the United States, during which she will address a joint session of Congress and visit MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Fla. (there, according to palace rumor, to meet with and perhaps confer an honorary knighthood on Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf), the Queen was confronted with two reminders of the problem of her symbolic, magical role. The first came with the enthronement of a new Archbishop of Canterbury as steward of the state church that she heads, and the second was her 65th birthday.
At the consecration of the Most Rev. George Carey on April 19, traditionalists were appalled at the evangelical, upbeat, jazzy tone of the event. The Archbishop, who once said publicly that he would gladly change the name of the Church of England to "the Jesus Movement," allowed Canterbury Cathedral to be penetrated by saxophone players and other heralds of "the good news."
The Fidei Defensor had no choice but to attend. But among those pointedly staying away from this trendy outrage to the bones of Thomas a Becket was Prince Charles, who has evolved something of a reputation as a staunch defender of undiluted Anglican orthodoxy. Those who feel that modern liturgy and worship possess none of the magic of the old Book of Common Prayer find a champion in the Prince, so untypical of his baby-boom generation, who has also been very outspoken in his attacks on modern architecture and the sloppy use and teaching of English. His nonattendance, which was explained away by an increasingly busy Buckingham Palace press office as a matter of conflicting engagements and pressure of work, was the sign of his stolidity and seriousness as contrasted to the frivolity of his junior relatives and, indeed, of his wife.
The Queen's birthday, which for magical reasons is actually celebrated on her "official birthday" in June, naturally turned people's thoughts to the increasingly headlined topic of her possible abdication. Sixty-five is the retirement age for most of her subjects, and it has been noticed that she now needs spectacles to read her speech on the state opening of Parliament; that she looks tired at public events, and so on. Meanwhile, Prince Charles has to endure the frustration of playing heir to the throne until well into his 40's.
Taking this touchy subject head on, the novelist and biographer A. N. Wilson wrote an article prominently entitled "The Queen, Abdication and the Question of Charles III." Wilson's fictions and histories qualify him as a conservative with a small c, very much identified with a reverence for what might be called Victorian and traditional standards. He is the only man I know who dines with the Queen Mother and who once even went so far as to write about the experience. He wrote: "It is no longer believed that there is any magic, apparently, about being Queen, and if she feels that she would like to spend more time with her horses in Kentucky, or looking at her father's stamp collection in Sandringham, there is no reason why the Queen should not put her feet up."
Having stated this popular view of the matter, Wilson argued against it: "The Queen did not get her job by mere promotion, as would a bank manager or a Cabinet minister. She was anointed and crowned in a religious ceremony with the clear understanding that being crowned, like being married in church, was something for life. Once an anointed monarch, always an anointed monarch."
There is an inescapable truth to this, despite the increasing demand that the Queen step down and rescue her firstborn son from the waiting room of the "Dynasty" soap opera. On the day of her coronation, the then-Archbishop of Canterbury stated: "This country and Commonwealth . . . were not far from the Kingdom of Heaven." The rituals of anointment, as performed and solemnized, are supposed to be sacred. As The London Times put it on the same occasion: "In her is incarnate on her coronation the whole of society, of which the state is no more than a political manifestation."
Indeed, Parliament itself enacts laws solely in its capacity as the embodiment of the Crown, and one of the Tory and Thatcherite objections to British participation in an increasingly federal Europe is that the primal notion of "the Crown in Parliament" would be diluted. Let no one suppose that the British think that such matters of their history -- with the words "sovereign" and "sovereignty" closely identified -- are mere quaint details. Blood has been shed over them ever since Oliver Cromwell decided that a parliamentary nation should lop off its crowned head. So, having read him making this awkward but essential point, I was surprised when having a drink with A. N. Wilson to hear him say that the monarchy was a vain and foolish business and that he would not mind if it were entirely done away with.
When literary persons of his standing start talking like this -- and the literary world tends to be royalist if only because it is included in the twice-annual distribution of medals and decorations by Buckingham Palace -- then the Crown is in some kind of trouble. If the Queen stays on, as magic says she must, then she will grow antique in the job and her son will become, as Wilson describes him, "morose and tetchy" to an even greater degree. He will be stale before his time.
If she steps down, on the other hand, she breaks the compact with realm and nation that she made on her accession and, on a practical note, becomes a looming dowager presence over the throne held by the new incumbent. Since the country already has a rather colorless Prime Minister dwelling nervously in the shadow of a formidable female predecessor, this might not be the most suitable or dignified outcome. Here is another dilemma that the hereditary system supplies and the much-despised presidential (or democratic) system does not.
"Oh, I'm quite sure she'll never abdicate," Philip Ziegler says confidently. "The British people like their monarchs to be either very old or very young -- Prince Hal or Queen Victoria -- and the Queen knows what's expected of her. It's her duty to provide a very long reign. Prince Charles will be quite happy, using his freedom to comment on matters like architecture and the environment."
LONG-RUN tendencies tell against the primacy of the Crown as it is now constituted. To take one very obvious example, Britain is now (as it was not when Elizabeth II ascended the throne) a conspicuously multiracial and multicultural society. For the Queen to be head of the Church of England is no longer for her to be, in any serious sense, a spiritual figurehead. Not only are there large Roman Catholic and Jewish minorities in the United Kingdom -- the former alone greatly embarrassing the Queen's role as, effectively, and by her own choice, monarch of only just over half of Northern Ireland -- but a large and growing number of Muslems are making their presence visible in everything from education to literary criticism. The fact that members of the royal family are prohibited by law from marrying a Roman Catholic is therefore only the least of the many anomalies for a supposed emblem of national unity.
Add to this the growing debate on constitutional reform. A highly vocal movement named Charter 88 -- composed mainly, but not exclusively, of writers and intellectuals -- has changed the terms of political argument in Britain by pressing for a constitutional bill of rights on the American model, and thus challenging the supreme right of Parliament to make any law that it chooses.
At present, the British people are "subjects," not "citizens." They can be told what to do by what Lord Hailsham, the former Tory Lord Chancellor, once famously called "an elective dictatorship." So the demand for entrenched and inalienable constitutional guarantees strikes at the heart of the political settlement made in 1688 -- the so-called Glorious Revolution" -- whereby the former powers of the deposed King James II were passed to Parliament and a new dynasty founded by the importation of the House of Orange.
On the right, the modernizing monetarists centered at the Institute of Economic Affairs -- think tank for many of Margaret Thatcher's privatizing and marketeering initiatives -- have produced a pamphlet by Frank Vibert that calls for the monarchy to be stripped of all but its ceremonial powers. Thus, to an extent that it would have been impossible to predict even a decade ago, the monarchy has become a political subject as the varying pressures for political libertarianism, for new European institutions and a more modern system come up against the traditions of an ancien regime whose symbolic leadership has internal troubles of its own making.
Once the monarchical apex of the system is challenged, the less popular features of the old order, such as the House of Lords as a nonelected second chamber, become much harder to defend. Indeed, the whole hierarchy of British society would look rather threadbare if it were not for the golden coach, the orb and scepter and the Crown -- known to cynical republicans as "a hat that lets in the rain." Not for nothing is the allegedly apolitical monarchy considered a force for "stability" -- a word that is never quite as apolitical as it seems.
In his story "Russian Hide- and-Seek," the novelist Kingsley Amis (who was created Sir Kingsley by Her Majesty less than a year ago) wrote about a futuristic Britain that had been incorporated into the Soviet Empire. Gradually it becomes evident that the turning point in the Russian subjugation of the conquered Anglo-Saxons has been the execution, disguised clumsily as a suicide, of their Queen. When a Russian officer asks an English doctor his feelings about this, the man becomes all gruff and stiff upper lip: "Please don't let's discuss the matter." When the other assumes a look of theatrical puzzlement, he hurries on: "Because I know from experience that it's quite impossible to explain to a Russian how we feel about that. After what happened . . . there's no point."
This captures quite nicely the indefinable sense that average conservative Britons have of their sovereign as a self-sacrificing, nearly miraculous person; someone only they can understand and who understands them in return -- someone for foreigners to envy and admire but never to comprehend.
Philip Ziegler's book "Crown and People," which contains the results of many surveys of public and street opinion, has as a recurring feature the conviction that Americans are jealous of the monarchy. Typical of many comments is one reported by a Mass Observation polling monitor at the time of the coronation, a man of 60 who said: "I'll say one thing. I think the Americans are a bit jealous. They like it, they think it's wonderful and all that; but they're just a little bit jealous, as if they wished it was theirs." You don't have to spend long in a pub to hear similar sentiments similarly expressed.
This sense that the Queen is all that is left of past imperial splendor must be felt at palace level also, because very particular attention is paid to the deployment of the royal family in the "special relationship" with the former colonies. Visits by one or another royal are frequent and various, with Prince Charles preferring to spend time with Walter Annenberg and Princess Diana choosing the company of John Travolta and Donald Trump.
Some visits are successful -- when the queen made her first visit as Princess Elizabeth, one Washington politician was so overcome on meeting her that he claimed to have met "your father -- Sir Winston." Some are less happy -- as when the then-unmarried Prince Charles thought President Nixon was leaving him too much alone with his daughter Tricia. But in general a royal progress through the United States leads to a good press, some prestige for British exports, a terrific riot over invitations to the reception or garden party in Washington and some enhancement to diplomatic and military relations.
Two honorary knighthoods have recently been conferred on American citizens; one on Caspar W. Weinberger (for services rendered during the Falklands war) and one on Ronald Reagan, and both decisions were taken on the direct prompting of the Foreign Office. The Germans and the Saudis may be able to do many things for their American guests, but one thing they cannot do is take them to Buckingham Palace and lay a ceremonial sword on their shoulders. The present visit is planned as a sort of seal on what was seen throughout Britain as an Anglo-American, rather than an American-led, combined operation. If General Schwarzkopf goes so far as to forget what Jefferson wrote about "the false glare which surrounds kingly government," he will be only the latest in a long line of Democrats and Republicans to do so.
In his acid and crusty memoirs, which are now making the London rounds and causing sharp intake of breath with their caustic reflections, Sir Kingsley Amis speaks quite candidly about his dreams -- some of them rather carnal -- about the Queen. This confession is not as novel as it may appear. A few years ago, there appeared an entire book called "Dreams About H. M. the Queen," in which subjects of every rank and calling confided their fantasies. These were most commonly of embarrassment; of meeting the Queen unprepared or unawares. The book contained a warning. "The dream," it said, "is not about the Queen. It is about you." Some of the British are beginning to notice the difference.

CORRECTION-DATE: June 16, 1991, Sunday, Late Edition - Final

 CORRECTION:
An article in The Times Magazine on May 12 about the British royal family and a correction in this space on May 19 referred incompletely to the reason the sovereign is called Defender of the Faith. The title was given to King Henry VIII by Pope Leo X in 1521 but was withdrawn by the Roman Catholic Church after Henry broke with it. During Henry's monarchy, an act of Parliament later joined the title to the English crown.

HEADLINE: Shore Tries New Tack In Luring Tourists

BYLINE: By LEO H. CARNEY

 BODY:
IN years past, the tourism industry in New Jersey largely relied on the 127-mile stretch of sandy beaches from Sandy Hook to Cape May to sell itself. Now, with many vacationers discouraged by the recession and by the pollution of summers past, and with the state cutting back on promotion money, tourism and local government officials have teamed up with business owners to package and sell the Jersey Shore.
"What we're seeing this year is business people networking among themselves to promote tourism, and cooperation even between chambers of commerce, which you never saw before," said Gordon S. Reinauer, the chairman of the Shore Region Tourism Council, a group of tourism-related businesses and local government agencies in Monmouth and Ocean Counties. 
 He pointed to the marketing of tour packages on Long Beach Island and in Spring Lake as illustrative of local promotional efforts. Among the half-dozen packages on Long Beach Island, for example, are those that include sightseeing at Barnegat Lighthouse, meals at a selection of restaurants, charter-boat deep-sea fishing and a visit to the Fantasy Island amusement park. Businesses and merchants, Mr. Reinauer said, "are being encouraged to work out things like freebies, coupons, transportation and other inducement to amusement parks, restaurants, antique shops, hotels, inns and even malls, where vacationers at the beach can go on a rainy day."
Tourism officials and others say it is too early to judge the results of the new marketing strategy. But preliminary indications, like preseason rentals, they say, give them cause for some optimism. Among the upbeat is Donald O'Rourke, a spokesman for the Ocean County Board of Chosen Freeholders.
"If the weather is good," he said, "I think we'll have a banner year."
The downturn at the Shore in recent seasons is attributable to two largely unrelated phenomena. Widespread reports of ocean pollution and beach closings beginning in 1987 resulted in fewer vacationers and an erosion of tourism revenue. For the Shore, what was a $7 billion a year industry in 1987 is expected to total less than $6 billion this year.
At the same time, many resort towns have seen a falloff in rental properties -- and tourist dollars -- as they have become either year-round communities or enclaves of second homes that are not rented out by the owners. Also undermining the Shore economy are the regional and national recessions, as well as a trend toward shorter vacations caused by socioeconomic changes, like working couples' being unable to coordinate their job schedules.
But with the shorter-vacation trend, at least, tourism officials see an opportunity: as vacationers worry about getting the most for scarce dollars, the officials say, many are opting for the vacation closest to home.
The Shore's promoters, like Mr. Reinauer and Peter Schnell, head of the Ocean County Tourism Advisory Council, pointed out that many businesses in Monmouth and Ocean Counties had decided to market their boardwalk and other beach-related businesses vigorously this year, spending thousands of dollars in hopes of winning back the vacationers. But the marketing efforts also encompass shopping, sightseeing and such rainy-day activities as indoor fashion shows at shopping malls.
 
Municipalities' Efforts
 Meanwhile, county governments and individual municipalities are placing new emphasis on promotional programs, Mr. Reinauer and Mr. Schnell said. Ocean County, for example, will spend $150,000 or more this spring to promote tourism, Mr. Schnell said.
Mr. Reinauer noted that the $350,000 that the state made available in 1989 to Shore communities for special grants to promote local events had dwindled to $200,000 this year because of the budget cuts.
In Belmar, Marie Newbery, the official who oversees beach activities, recited a long list of oceanfront events planned from June 2 to Labor Day that will be financed by the Borough of Belmar and commercial promoters. The events include amateur and professional volleyball tournaments, bicycle and jet-ski races, a jazz festival, surfing contests and a five-mile run.
"There has been a big effort this year to get more people to visit us," she said, adding that much of the organization of these events came from the business community there.
In Asbury Park, Garrett L. Giberson, a spokesman for the city, said the city would hold a boardwalk rock festival this summer, to be broadcast by a New York City radio station, WNEW-FM.
 
Lighthouse to Reopen
 Farther south, in Barnegat Light, the historic Barnegat Lighthouse, known as Old Barney, will reopen on Memorial Day after being closed three years for restoration. And Ocean Grove, in Monmouth County, has a full summer schedule of special events on the boardwalk and at the Great Auditorium, which was built in 1896.
At the Fantasy Island amusement park in Beach Haven, Fern Schoderer, the promotions manager, said she was expecting a banner season, thanks to the various tour packages and a trend toward shorter vacactions and day trips. The park has not yet realized the profits that were expected when it opened in 1985, Miss Schoderer said, but there have been small and steady increases each year since.
"In good times and bad times," Miss Schoderer said, "even when people don't have enough money to take out their family to a restaurant, they won't refuse their children a trip to an amusement park."
 
Encouragement on Rentals
 Preseason rentals along the Shore have, for the most part, provided an encouraging sign. Dolores Szelling, the rental manager for H.C.H. Real Estate in Harvey Cedars, said rentals along the northern half of Long Beach Island were up 20 percent over last year's.
Jeanne DiPaola, a spokesman for the southern Ocean County Chamber of Commerce, said business along the 18-mile Long Beach Island improved last summer over 1989, especially for rentals and the restaurant trade. Vacation packages, with a variety of places to stay and sights to see, had helped, Ms. DiPaola said, as had a brochure that is distributed by the tens of thousands.
And for the coming season "we're seeing some very dramatic increases over 1990 in rentals and motel reservations, too," Ms. DiPaola said.
Eugene Dilbeck, director of the New Jersey Division of Travel and Tourism, said that a promising sign of a successful summer in 1991 was reports the division had received from real-estate agents, who said the renters included families who were returning to the Shore after not vacationing there for five years or so.
But last year, in the spring, the Division of Travel and Tourism had said that preseason shore rentals were running 30 percent above 1989. At summer's end, however, the agency said the actual increase had been only 10 percent.
 
Differences of Opinion
 Others are currently less sanguine in their assessments of preseason rentals.
An innkeeper in Cape May, who insisted on not being identified, for example, said reports by real-estate agents of a 15 to 40 percent increase in preseason rentals were overly optimistic. "They say the same thing every year," he said. "I'll let you know in September if they were right, but our rentals aren't up like that."
Another innkeeper, Carl Conover of Bay Head, said that weekend reservations there for the coming season were merely satisfactory, not exceptional, and that weekday reservations were down, as they had been last year, despite his advertising in national and international directories.
"The preseason reservations and property rentals are generally an accurate barometer of how the summer will be," Mr. Conover said, although he added that "we get a good amount of last-minute rentals, too."
 
Feeling the Budget Pinch
 Mr. Dilbeck, of the Division of Travel and Tourism, acknowledged that budget cuts had hampered the state agency's efforts. The agency's budget has shrunk to $7.6 million this year from $9 million in 1988. As a result, he said, the agency could no longer afford national radio and television advertising that it had sponsored in the past.
He said the $1.9 million that the agency would spend on advertising this spring would be placed in national and regional magazines, like Good Housekeeping, Family Circle and Baltimore Magazine. Roughly a quarter of the ads are specific to the Shore. Others, he said, extol the pleasures of casino gambling in Atlantic City, the state's rich history or the rural splendors of the state's northwest.
"I am dealing the hand I was dealt," Mr. Dilbeck said, referring to the small budget, "and that does not mean I am dealing the hand I wanted." He said $10 million to $12 million a year was need to promote tourism adequately in New Jersey.
With the decline in state support, Mr. Dilbeck said, the agency has adopted the attitude that it is more like a shopping mall operator that advertises the mall itself -- the state -- and the individual communities and businesses are like the mall's retail outlets, which must promote their own specific goods and attractions.
For example, the theme of the division's three-day Governor's conference on tourism in Cherry Hill in March was "Building Partnerships for the 90's." National experts from organizations like the American Express Travel Services Group and Travelers Weekly, a magazine, gave talks and seminars on "Optimizing Marketing Opportunities" and "Developing Tour Packages and Tour Package Partnerships."
"They have to spend their own money now, and also be more creative," Mr. Reinauer said.
 
Uncertainty Over Pollution
 Despite the upbeat talk of tourism officials and merchants, the threat of ocean pollution remains a lingering uncertainty.
State environmental officials note that much has been done to rid the beaches of plastic, wood and other debris; to monitor potential problems from floating waste and garbage in nearby harbors, rivers and offshore waters and to vigorously test bathing waters for bacteria. But the officials say the quality of ocean water this summer will remain anyone's guess.
"We are still vulnerable to easterly storms and driving winds, or to periods of heavy rain that can either force floatables onto beaches or cause bacterial levels to rise in surf waters," said Ed Neafsey, director of enforcement policy and ocean issues for the State Department of Environmental Protection in Trenton.
Acknowledging imponderables like pollution and the tight economy make it impossible to predict accurately how successful the summer season will be. Mr. Dilbeck said the state's advertising campaign could draw an additional 400,000 visitors to the Shore if the weather was good. "We just don't know how deep their pockets will be," he said.

More Thinking About Proposing The Unthinkable

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
In his broadcast call to alms last week, Mayor David N. Dinkins took pains (a word whose variants he invoked seven times) to distinguish the fiscal crisis New York City faced 16 years ago from the great (a word whose derivatives he employed nine times) challenges posed by the current budget crisis.
The 1975 version, the Mayor said, was precipitated by "financial gimmicks and budgetary tricks." In contrast, Mr. Dinkins said, the deepening crisis he inherited last year "is largely the direct result of a failing national economy." 
 But the thrust of his speech was strikingly similar to the refrain sounded in May 1975 by Mayor Abraham D. Beame, a few months before the city was, in effect, placed in receivership. Mr. Beame, too, blamed a national recession. He recounted "unheard of" economies he had already imposed. Unable to muster support for his austerity budget, he proposed an "unthinkable" one. With the help of the public and the assembled officials, he concluded, "I will not fail you."
Mr. Dinkins was somewhat less equivocal last week. "I do not intend to fail," he declared a third of the way through his speech, rousing his invited audience at City Hall to only its third smattering of perfunctory applause.
What does Mr. Dinkins intend to do?
His speech and the budget he formally presented on Friday offered few new clues for dealing with the city's enduring structural deficit. A few high-profile cuts (eliminating lifeguards at public beaches, for one) seemed to have been proposed under the politically correct presumption that the City Council would restore them. Others may become self-fulfilling, though; the deficit is real, even if some of the proposed solutions may not be.
Why did he give the speech?
Mr. Dinkins would rather address the public directly than have his remarks filtered though the media. (He usually prefers to govern in camera.) He appeared earnest and unusually impas sioned, but his nothing- for-everyone speech was heavy on props, platitudes and perspi ration (which, given the one percent of in spiration required by Thomas Edison's defi nition, may qualify the Mayor as a genius).
 The Mayor cautioned againstfinger-point ing. But he took swipes at his predecessor and attributed the city's 10- digit deficit largely to the Federal Government. He has been instrumental in uniting fellow mayors and is to join them again this week in Washington to press their domestic agenda jointly with a new Congressional urban caucus.
Mr. Dinkins defended himself, though, for having lobbied in behalf of his pet spending priorities when he sat on the Board of Estimate as the Manhattan Borough President. ("I did a whole lot with that one damn vote," he said.) He also defended commitments he had made as Mayor -- to expand the police force and raise the pay of city employees -- that now confine him.
Shouldn't he have spoken sooner?
Yes, but would he have been any more believable? By Friday, at least Mr. Dinkins had completed a full week in which his message was consistent, even if he has yet to deliver on most of it. "It is not in words that I should wish my life distinguished but rather in things done," he quoted Sophocles, who also wrote: "That pilot of state who sets no hand to the best policy, but remains tongue-tied through some terror, seems vilest of men."
Has he, indeed, done the unthinkable?
"Without help," Mr. Dinkins said, "the unthinkable will become the unavoidable." Some of the economies he has proposed and imposed were overdue. He even disclosed that a panel he appointed was reviewing the possibility of imposing tolls on the East River bridges. But his conclusion that the recession represents "less an opportunity than a calamity" implies that some things are still unthinkable.
Top-heavy administrations have been pared at the Board of Education and the Health and Hospitals Corporation -- which Budget Director Philip R. Michael said is almost no longer dependent on the city for general support -- but not in the Police Department.
Not until Borough President Howard Golden of Brooklyn pressed was the administration willing to consider a proposal to save millions of dollars in overtime costs by avoiding the heavy use of police officers at nonconfrontational public events.
Mr. Dinkins appealed to New Yorkers to help replace lapsed city services. But he stopped short of suggesting that there are some services the city should no longer provide because it cannot afford to.
What does he consider unthinkable?
Freedom, as the song says, is just another word for nothing left to lose. With so many of his own dreams deferred by the deficit, the Mayor never fully explained why, beyond symbolism, New Yorkers would be that much worse off if the State Financial Control Board or a similar body stepped in to help. Instead, he declared Friday: "Fiscal independence must be maintained at all costs."

HEADLINE: Wary of Expense, Soviets Debate Bill to Ease Travel and Emigration

BYLINE: By ESTHER B. FEIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, May 12

 BODY:
Soviet legislators today discussed the financial and human-rights considerations raised by a long-debated bill that would allow citizens the freedom to travel and emigrate. But they were unable to resolve their conflicting concerns and postponed a vote on the measure.
Although the Soviet Union has considerably eased its once overwhelming obstacles for those seeking to leave the country, on visits or permanently, it still does not have a law that grants its citizens the right to choose whether and when to go abroad. 
 This has created obstacles in the United States to granting most-favored-nation trading status to the Soviet Union, a designation that could help ease the country's critical economic situation by relaxing trade barriers and allowing millions of dollars in credits.
The Supreme Soviet first took up the so-called freedom-of-movement bill two years ago. But fears of a large-scale wave of emigration and of the high costs of putting such a law into effect have continuously pushed the subject back into committee for further discussion. As a result, many Western governments have questioned the country's commitment to guaranteeing travel and migration rights.
 
Support From Gorbachev
 With a recent show of support for the bill by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, supporters of the measure say that it may finally be nearing passage. The debate is scheduled to resume on Monday, and legislators say there is a good chance that there will be a vote.
A presidential spokesman said last week that Mr. Gorbachev was in favor of lifting barriers for those wishing to travel abroad. The spokesman, Vitaly N. Ignatenko, said that "to our regret, the bill has gone through several readings," but added, "It is being fully supported by the President."
In today's debate, and in discussions of the bill that began last week, lawmakers detailed the cost of a law granting across-the-board freedom to travel or emigrate.
They quoted estimates by the official press agency Tass and other Government departments that it would cost the country the equivalent of $20 billion to print passports and new customs forms, increase staff at passport agencies, customs offices and border-control points, and increase the number of outward-bound flights.
That price tag, many of them said, did not include the loss of manpower and intellectual capacity that the country would suffer if all who wished to leave were allowed to go.
 
Hurdles Would Remain
 If the bill is passed, it is not expected to go into effect until July 1992.
And even under the new law, Soviet citizens trying to leave would face substantial hurdles. With low reserves of critically needed hard currency, the Soviet Government strictly limits the amount of rubles a citizen can change into dollars or other convertible currencies, making it difficult for many to pay for a trip or a move abroad.
More important, permission to leave the country does not guarantee that another country would agree to receive potential emigrants. Leaders of Western European nations have already expressed concern that passage of the bill would cause a flood of labor in the European Community, which is already struggling to absorb millions of workers from Eastern Europe.
The immigration issue was long a stumbling block in relations between Moscow and Washington. Tension over the subject has eased in recent years, as the authorities here have relaxed travel restrictions. But Congress has been reluctant to lift remaining trade barriers until the more open policies are enshrined in law.

HEADLINE: Bush Greeted With Silent Protest at Black College

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HAMPTON, Va., May 12

 BODY:
Two-thirds of 1,023 graduating seniors at Hampton University, a historically black institution, remained seated and silent to protest the Bush Administration's civil rights policies today as the President received an honorary degree.
There were a few moans and some laughter as the university's president, William R. Harvey, read the citation recognizing Mr. Bush's "long and steady support for historically black colleges and universities." About 30 students raised their clenched fists into the air. 
 But it was an understated, even polite demonstration as most of the students, who had been standing for the singing of the school song, simply sat down abruptly while Mr. Bush took the stage to the strains of "Hail to the Chief."
There was scattered applause from faculty members, some students and parents for Mr. Bush, whose speech went through a wide range of domestic issues but hardly mentioned civil rights.
 
Sending a Message
 "The students wanted to do something subtle," said Carvel Lewis, the senior class president, who said it was "an honor" to have Mr. Bush at the ceremony. "With the world looking at us, they wanted to act like the educated people that they are, but also do something that would be noticed."
Still, it was a substantial change from the enthusiastic crowds that generally greet Mr. Bush, especially since the Persian Gulf war. And the protest not only demonstrated the unhappiness on one college campus with Mr. Bush's veto of the 1990 Civil Rights Act, but was also a reminder that the President has yet to come to grips with the civil rights issues that have been troubling him since he took office.
Nonetheless, the President stuck to his plans to avoid any discussion of civil rights in the speech, one of a series of commencement addresses that he is delivering this spring on major issues facing the country.
Mr. Bush does plan a speech on civil rights. He will deliver it on June 2, at the United States Military Academy in West Point, N.Y.
 
Promoting Free Trade
 Mr. Lewis said he had not expected Mr. Bush to talk about civil rights, but some of his classmates were disappointed. "One of my friends said he wanted to hear more about what the job market is going to be for us, what the economic prospects are for the country and about the civil rights bill that Bush vetoed," Mr. Lewis said.
Instead, in what had been billed as a major address on "the new world economic order," Mr. Bush gave more of a campaign stump speech extolling his proposals on free trade with Mexico, educational reform and encouraging programs that allow public housing residents to buy their homes.
White House aides argued that simply because Mr. Bush was addressing a largely black audience did not mean he must discuss civil rights. They said it was unfair to criticize the President for not raising the issue.
 
Aware of the Opposition
 Mr. Bush returned to Camp David, Md., after the ceremony and planned to take Monday off at the request of doctors treating a thyroid ailment that has been blamed for an irregular heartbeat. Asked how he would spend the day, Mr. Bush replied, "Jogging." But it was not clear whether he was joking or really intended to resume the exercise that touched off his heart flutter on May 4.
The White House had been aware of the opposition among some Hampton students to Mr. Bush's appearance today; Mr. Lewis said a Presidential aide went to the university last week to discuss Mr. Bush's positions on civil rights with students.
Mr. Bush did not acknowledge the silent demonstration. "The President appreciated the warm welcome and the opportunity to address the students at Hampton," said Judy Smith, the assistant White House press secretary.
Mr. Harvey said the institution was giving Mr. Bush his honorary Doctor of Laws degree "because of your long and steady support for historically black colleges and universities." He also mentioned that Mr. Bush had founded the Yale chapter of the United Negro College Fund as a student.
Mr. Lewis said that many students on campus thought Mr. Bush's actions years ago were not persuasive. "A lot of the students thought, 'Big deal.' "
A document distributed by a group of students said, "We feel that we should only honor any person who has benefited the entire African American community and not just its wealthy and most fortunate."
As he began to speak, Mr. Bush tried a few jokes: "You know, President Harvey is an avid tennis player. Really avid. When I shook his hand he corrected my grip."
But there was little laughter and Mr. Bush launched into his prepared text, which roamed from educational opportunity to free trade, a pitch for his proposed cut in the capital gains tax, affordable housing and general statements about America's role in the post-cold war world.
But there was only one direct reference to domestic civil rights issues. Mr. Bush said: "We must free people who have been held back by barriers of discrimination. This Administration will fight discrimination vigorously because a kinder, gentler nation must not be gentle or kind to those who practice prejudice. We must free people bound by red tape and unnecessary regulation."

HEADLINE: Dinkins and Koch Trade Barbs on Fiscal Performance

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
In a whirlwind round of live and taped television appearances yesterday, Mayor David N. Dinkins defended his handling of New York City's fiscal problems and took some sharp swipes at the stewardship of his predecessor, Edward I. Koch. The former Mayor replied with a few barbed counterpunches reminiscent of the blows he delivered in his own days at City Hall.
"I don't know that it's too fruitful to blame others," Mr. Dinkins said on the WABC-TV "Eyewitness News Conference" after a long week of bad budget news. "I think what people want is resolutions to the problems, as opposed to finger-pointing." 
 The Mayor's resolutions call for, among other things, $1 billion in new taxes and spending cuts that would shut shelters for the homeless and turn off street lights.
But in defending himself and his plans for closing a $3.5 billion gap in the city's $28.7 billion budget for the fiscal year that starts July 1, the Mayor made it clear that he believed there was plenty of blame to go around -- from the Federal and state governments to Mr. Koch.
Noting that the city's work force grew by 50,000 people from the early 80's until he took office, he said: "That was not done by Dinkins. It was done by my predecessor."
 
Prior Planning Criticized
 The Mayor, who has generally avoided pointing a finger at Mr. Koch, also said the city was forced to trim plans for building long-term projects, since it could not afford the interest on bonds issued under "plans made heretofore which may have seemed well and good at the time but were not."
"And mind you," Mr Dinkins added, "while we were doing that in the past, yet we weren't taking care of bridges, and that's why we have our crumbling infrastructure today. So it's significant that many of the actions we take today are to cure the errors of the past."
Asked on the WCBS-TV "Sunday Edition" program whether he, as Manhattan Borough President, had urged Mr. Koch to save money, Mr. Dinkins bristled a bit and said, "What I used to recommend was that we spend money differently."
As Borough President, Mr. Dinkins supported many of the social-service programs that he is now proposing to cut while hiring thousands of new police officers.
Mr. Dinkins was also a member of the Board of Estimate, where he had just one of 11 votes on the budget from 1986 through 1989. Thus, he said, he did not "remotely" bear the same responsibility as Mr. Koch for not spending more carefully.
 
Koch Response: 'Baloney'
 Mr. Koch, in a telephone interview, called the Dinkins criticisms "baloney."
"I never saw David Dinkins ask that we paint the bridges," the former Mayor said, "I only saw him ask for increases in social services. I'm not saying the bridges were not my responsibility, too."
Mr. Koch said the only area in which he had restored the work force to the levels in effect before the fiscal crisis of 1975 was education.
"Did he want me not to?" he asked. "I increased social services for abused children. He wanted even more."
Mr. Koch called Mr. Dinkins, who was elected with strong labor support, a "prisoner of the unions."
"He thought they were his partners," the former Mayor said. "They turned out to be his executioners."
 
Raises Are Defended
 Leland T. Jones, a spokesman for Mr. Dinkins, said the Mayor would not answer Mr. Koch's rebuttal because "he does not respond to columnists."
Mr. Dinkins defended his decision to grant raises to municipal employees, though he is now struggling to get some of that money back through concessions.
"I expect them to make concessions that will be acceptable to us," he said. An 18-month wage deferral, for example, would be unacceptable, the Mayor said, because it would merely postpone the problem. His aides have said he is seeking more than a half-billion dollars in wage, benefit or work-rule changes.
Yesterday the New York City Partnership, a business and civic group, urged Mr. Dinkins to find at least $800 million in labor savings and productivity moves.
Mr. Dinkins has proposed saving hundreds of millions of dollars through various efforts to make the government more efficient.
But the Mayor also said in a live interview on the CBS-TV news program "Face the Nation" that New York was entitled to more help from Washington. He plans to go to the capital on Wednesday with other urban mayors to argue for what he called emergency "anti-recession" aid to cities.

HEADLINE: Fund-Raising on Target for Whopping Victory Parade

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN

 BODY:
With a month to go, New York's salute to the veterans of the Persian Gulf war -- a huge, triumphant ticker-tape parade up lower Broadway's Canyon of Heroes -- is on schedule, planners say, and very likely to meet its twin goals of total private financing and a spectacle rivaling those for Lindbergh or V-J Day.
In an outpouring of support for the hard-pressed city and troops of the American-led coalition, the organizers say, scores of corporations, hundreds of businesses and thousands of individuals have pledged $4.1 million in cash, goods and services, bringing Operation Welcome Home within reach of its $5 million goal for the June 10 extravaganza. 
 If continuing appeals meet expectations, organizers say they will be able to spare the city up to $2.5 million in police, sanitation and other costs; defray all other parade expenses; sponsor an interfaith service and a fireworks display, and have enough left to aid some returning veterans and families of those killed or wounded in the war.
And if all goes as planned, they say, two million people in lower Manhattan and millions more watching television around the world will see 30,000 marchers -- troops and dignitaries from every state, every gulf regiment and all 40 allied nations -- march up Broadway with floats, veterans of other wars, Medal of Honor recipients and a legion of thundering bands under cascades of cheering and a blizzard of confetti and ticker tape.
 
Biggest Parade Planned
 "It's going to be larger than any ticker-tape parade in history," said Joseph H. Flom, co-chairman of Operation Welcome Home, a 30-member private commission named by Mayor David N. Dinkins in March to organize a heroes' welcome that has traditionally been planned and paid for by the city itself.
"It will be wonderful -- a unique experience," said Peter Kohlmann, executive director of the commission. "Imagine yourself in the middle of a big snowstorm with millions of people cheering all around you, people dumping confetti out windows and off the rooftops. It's a form of New York respect and love."
Some 3,000 dignitaries -- ambassadors, cabinet officers, governors, members of Congress, labor and civic leaders -- will join the Mayor in the reviewing stands at City Hall Park, while Secretary of De fense Dick Cheney, Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, the gulf commander, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Gen. Colin L. Powell, and other military and civilian leaders will ride or march in the parade.
Along the one-mile parade route from the Battery to Worth Street, scores of five-foot yellow-ribbon bows will be painted on the pavement, symbols of the void left on the block by a soldier gone to war.
Although parades on St. Patrick's Day, Puerto Rican Day and other occasions have often mustered larger gatherings or longer marches along Fifth Avenue, ticker-tape parades have usually been short lavish bursts of adoration on lower Broadway for lone heroes or a few world-class athletes, political or military victors, astronauts or foreign leaders.
Those honored have included Charles A. Lindbergh in 1928, Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1945, John Glenn in 1962, the world champion New York Mets in 1969 and 1986, the New York Yankees in 1978, Pope John Paul II in 1979, the American hostages returned from Iran in 1981 and, last year, Nelson Mandela, the African National Congress leader.
 
Foreign Troops, Too
 Next month's parade will more closely resemble those that followed the Armistice of World War I and victories in Europe and the Pacific in World War II, when returning American troops marched up the Canyon of Heroes at shoulder arms and were engulfed in ticker-tape and patriotism.
Outlining plans for the parade, Eric Andrus, a spokesman for the organizers, said, "We're going to have 30,000 marchers, troops from all 50 states, a heavy contingent of New York City-area Desert Storm troops and veterans from World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War."
Besides American Army, Navy and Marine contingents, he said, troops or other representatives from most of the 40 nations in the coalition that defeated Iraq, and from Israel, which was bombed but did not respond militarily, are expected to take part. Bands, floats, fife and drum corps and many civilian organizations, including labor groups, will also participate, he said.
Among the marchers will be a contingent of at least 87 of the 210 living recipients of the Congressional Medal of Honor, the nation's highest award for valor. The eldest are four 80-year-old veterans of World War II. Those honored are to be flown to New York by American Express, their hosts and a principal contributor to the parade.
 
1,000 Tons of Paper
 The marchers will step off at 11:30 A.M. from Battery Park and move up Broadway in the shadows between the skyscrapers. More than 1,000 tons of ticker tape, shredded paper and confetti, much of it distributed by parade organizers, will flutter down from windows and rooftops.
"It's a blizzard of paper and color and sparkle," Mr. Kohlmann said, conjuring up scenes from ancient newsreels with streamers raining down through the sunlight upon a roaring tumult of humanity.
Most ticker-tape parades end at City Hall, where the Mayor and other officials greet and praise the heroes. But next month's parade will pass the reviewing stand in City Hall Park and continue north to Worth Street, where the marchers will disperse. The parade is expected to end at midafternoon.
The throngs lining Broadway that Monday are expected to be swelled by lunchtime crowds of workers from Manhattan's government-financial complex, and by people in town for the Puerto Rican Day Parade and the Welcome Back to Brooklyn Festival, both scheduled for June 9, and Fleet Week, the annual gathering of American warships in the harbor.
Although many details of news coverage remain to be worked out, the parade organizers say they expect the event to be telecast live by most local stations and by some of the American networks and broadcast in Europe, the Middle East, the Far East and Australia as well.
 
Fireworks at Night
 As part of the welcoming festivities, the organizers are planning to send out 5,000 invitations to an inter-faith service to be held at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, 112th Street and Amsterdam Avenue, at 4 P.M. on Sunday, June 9.
After Monday's parade, at about 9 or 9:30 P.M., the organizers are planning a half-hour fireworks display to be set off from barges in the East River at the South Street Seaport. Mr. Andrus said that Coca-Cola had agreed to sponsor part of the display but that a co-sponsor was still being sought.
Some 450 people, mostly volunteers, have worked on the parade for two months. The Mayor's 30-member commission has set the goals and raised most of the money; Mr. Kohlmann, the executive director, with a small paid staff and 400 volunteers, has coordinated planning, publicity and invitations; Eventures, a company that produces special events, has taken on the huge logistics of the parade without charge.
Deputy Mayor Bill Lynch and other mayoral staff members have met often with the parade organizers. The city, facing a budget crisis, will provide 3,000 police officers, 550 sanitation workers, a battalion of cleanup trucks and hundreds of other municipal employees, but will be reimbursed for all its expenses.
 
Aid for Veterans Planned
 Despite the recession, organizers say, more than 3,000 individuals and 40 corporations have donated $2.5 million in cash and $1.6 million in goods and services. About $300,000 is expected to be raised from the sale of T-shirts and tote bags, but the campaign will continue to provide funds for veterans and their families as well as the parade.
Noncash contributions, the organizers said, have included hotel rooms and airline tickets for visiting dignitaries; meals and gifts for service personnel; office supplies; donations of accounting, legal and advertising services, even tons of used ticker tape from a Connecticut company that still makes old-fashioned ticker-tape machines.
Has support for the troops waned since the war? "People are getting back to their day-to-day lives," Mr. Andrus said. "But there's still enthusiasm for this. I see it in the yellow ribbons people wear, in the calls we receive from people willing to help."
Among the hundreds of letters bearing contributions, he said, was one from Alison Bankes's fourth-grade class at the Todd School in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y. The children had raised $800 selling hot dogs.
"We hope this money will make a better parade for the troops of Desert Storm," the children wrote. "They deserve it!"

HEADLINE: U.S. Lawyers Flock to Brussels

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRUSSELS

 BODY:
As Brussels strengthens its hold as the administrative capital of the new Europe, American law firms have rushed to open offices to do everything from lobbying on waste-disposal rules to defending clients charged with antitrust violations.
With business slow at home, more than 20 large American firms have opened offices in the last two years, seeking to cash in on an expected avalanche of rule-making that will inevitably accompany the European Community's plans to form a barrier-free market next year. 
 "It's part of 1992 mania," said Barry E. Hawk, head of the Brussels office of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, the New York-based firm. "The business community discovered 1992, and then the lawyers discovered it."
The huge influx of American firms has many lawyers already worrying about a shakeout, and those worries are expected to slow the American invasion.
 
Raiding the Law Schools
 Nonetheless, the Americans have already left their fingerprints on this city's more leisurely Old World bar, which includes 3,000 Belgian lawyers and more than 200 non-Belgian firms. The high-paying American firms, for example, are bidding up salaries for young Belgian law school graduates, in some cases tripling their pay. Fearing the American behemoths, many Belgian law firms are scurrying to merge with each other or with Dutch firms to add bulk and breadth.
Working seven-day weeks to impress clients, the American firms are putting pressure on the reluctant Brussels bar to do likewise. Mr. Hawk told the story of a client who one Friday afternoon gave Skadden, Arps research to do.
"They were ecstatic when we had it finished by Monday morning," he said. "They weren't used to that, but, believe me, now they're getting used to it." The Americans are sometimes the target of ridicule, particularly for the reams of documents in which they have buried European Commission officials. In Brussels, politesse and brevity are the rule.
"A lot of people say the Americans are too brash and are dumping too much paper on people's desks," said C. Mark Nicolaides, a partner in the three-lawyer office here of Mayer, Brown & Platt of Chicago.
An example: A loan between two Belgian companies negotiated by two American law firms produced a 110-page document. The American lawyers were proud of the thoroughness of the agreement, but one Belgian client was shocked. Having expected a document of a dozen pages, it worried that the pact was too complicated and could result in excessive fees.
The Americans, along with the many new British firms here, set an aggressive tone. American lawyers think nothing of rushing off to Turkey, South Korea or India to court potential clients threatened by suits from the European Community for their trade practices.
 
Just Like the New Deal
 The new arrivals see huge opportunities as the European Commission, the community's executive branch, adopts rules in areas that had been the preserve of national governments: telecommunications, public procurement, labor relations and environmental protection. In 1970, the community's official journal of new rules was three inches thick; now, each year's edition takes up a yard of shelf space.
Some lawyers say there has not been such an outburst of rule-making since the New Deal in the United States in the 1930's, when Washington assumed broad new powers in regulating the American economy. The current shift is transforming Brussels into Europe's law-firm capital because lawyers flock to power like moths to flame.
Some Americans say Belgian law firms are rushing to wed a foreign partner before they are trampled by the invading hordes. But Carl Bevernage, president of the Flemish-speaking bar in Brussels, said the invasion might help Belgian firms because the greater the number of firms that crowd into Brussels, the more legal work will be created.
 
Ticket for Growth
 As hard times push some American firms to lay off lawyers back home, many firms see Europe as the ticket for growth. Some Belgian lawyers angrily accuse the Americans of dumping excess lawyers in Europe. But Frederick L. Lukoff, a partner in the Brussels office of Oppenheimer, Wolff & Donnelly of St. Paul, disagrees. "The idea that you invest in one place at the same time you restructure in another is not a contradiction," he said.
Many firms are playing what might be called "keeping up with the Jones, Days." Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue, the big Cleveland-based law firm, opened here 16 months ago and has been aggressive in expanding. Its office has 13 lawyers, including 4 Belgians, 3 Italians, a German, a Frenchman and an Irishman.
Jones, Day has hired two respected antitrust lawyers who had worked at the European Commission. "We sought lawyers who had a long-established presence as opposed to merely plunking down a number of Americans," said Joseph F. Winterscheid, head of the Jones, Day office here.
The initial euphoria that American firms felt here is giving way to fears that there will be a brutal shakeout. There are more than 30 American firms in Brussels, up from 7 before 1987, as well as more than 200 non-Belgian firms, including many British, German and Dutch powerhouses.
"Over the next three years, people will realize there is not enough work to go around," said Mr. Nicolaides of Mayer, Brown.
Several firms say they are making profits, but the general consensus is that it will take most firms at least two years to break even.
The American firms are pursuing specialties. Jones, Day is concentrating on antitrust work; Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld of Dallas and Washington is focusing on lobbying and trade work. Mayer, Brown is specializing in work for banks, but it plans to expand into European Community regulatory law. McGuire, Woods, Battle & Boothe of Richmond opened its office here in January principally to advise one large client, the James River Corporation, also of Richmond, about the European Community's regulatory maze.
Belgian firms often complain about the starting salaries American firms pay to 25-year-old lawyers -- often $65,000 or more, at least twice what many Belgian firms pay. Belgian lawyers also say that some American lawyers acted unprofessionally when they placed advertisements to announce their arrival.
 
Lobbying Efforts Belittled
 The natives also belittle the American attempts at lobbying in Brussels. "Some people think that just because you are good at lobbying in Washington you can be good at lobbying here," said Walter W. Oberreit, a partner with the New York firm of Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen & Hamilton, which has been in Brussels since 1960. "A good Washington lawyer has been around a long time and knows the ins and outs. That person won't necessarily know all the ins and outs and all the faces in Brussels."
The levers of power work differently here than in Washington. While American agencies have a process for formal comment when they introduce new regulations, no such process exists within the community. In Washington, most lobbying is aimed at the Administration and Congress. But to influence community legislation, it might be necessary to lobby officials in the capitals of the 12 community countries and members of the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France, as well as officials from the European Commission in Brussels.
The lobbying style is also vastly different. As one American lawyer put it: "Here in Europe, it's impolite to be direct. If a client has deep concern with a proposal, you should say something like, 'We support the desire of the commission to do this, but we would invite the commission to make the following small changes.' In Washington you would say, 'The agency's action was fundamentally wrongheaded, violates the statutory intent and is wrong for the following 17 reasons.' "

HEADLINE: A Hard Line From China On Trade

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 12

 BODY:
China faces a difficult battle in Congress this summer to retain its preferential access to the United States market, but you would hardly know it from the unconciliatory remarks being made by Chinese officials.
Ambassador Zhu Qizhen, in a speech last week outlining his Government's position in the coming debate, took a hard and at times menacing line. China has not violated any human rights, he said; it does not have a problem trade surplus with the United States, and it keeps adequate controls over its exports of arms and nuclear technology.
 
Retaliation Is Likely
 China will also use high tariffs to drive American companies out of its markets if the United States does not renew the current trade privileges, Mr. Zhu added. Billions of dollars in contracts and thousands of jobs in industries from aircraft manufacturing to agricultural chemical production would be at risk, he said. 
 Mr. Zhu's remarks were only a little more strident than other policy statements by Chinese officials. For China has pursued a pugnacious four-pronged lobbying strategy here that has dismayed its friends and gladdened its foes.
Mr. Zhu's comments were not what members of Congress had hoped to hear. The massacre at Tiananmen Square in 1989, along with reports in the last month by a human rights group and a Congessman that political prisoners are being forced to produce goods for export, have so stained the reputation of China's leadership that diplomats' assurances carry little credibility.
A growing number of American lawmakers say they want China's "most favored nation" trade status revoked outright. "The Ambassador's threats will strengthen their case," said Representative Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat who opposes renewal unless it is linked to human rights improvements.
 
Bush Decision Due by June 3
 President Bush must notify Congress by June 3 if he wishes to renew for one year China's most-favored status, which is due to expire on July 3. A motion of disapproval, which seems likely to be introduced, would have to pass both houses of Congress within 90 days, and it probably would provoke a Presidential veto.
When President Bush renewed China's trade status last year, the House voted to disapprove the renewal. The Senate considered similar action but did not take a vote before the 90-day time limit expired, so the renewal stood.
Several lobbyists who favor renewal expect that this year President Bush will recommend a renewal of the special status, that both houses of Congress will disapprove it, and that the President will veto the disapproval. It is possible, though unlikely, that Congress will then override the veto.
Another possibility is that Congress will pair its disapproval of the status for China with approval of a renewal for the Soviet Union, said one lobbyist who favors a renewal for China. In that case, the President would face a particularly difficult dilemma, because the Soviet Union is in desperate need of certain trade subsidies and other credits that indirectly depend on a renewal of its status.
 
Tariff Would Rise to 47.48%
 The U.S.-China Business Council, a Washington-based group of American companies with investments in China, has estimated that the average tariff for the 25 biggest categories of American imports from China will rise to 47.48 percent, from 8.35 percent, if most-favored status is not renewed. With this status, Chinese products enter the United States at the lowest rate available to any American trading partner for each category of goods.
The test of China's strategy will come soon. Congress appeared increasingly likely last week to authorize the Administration to negotiate a free-trade agreement with Mexico and another round of reductions in global trade barriers. At the same time, China's trade status was moving quickly toward the top of the agendas of Washington's economic policy makers.
An eclectic alliance of trade protectionists, anti-Communist conservatives and liberal human rights advocates opposes an unconditional extension.
The strongest of China's four lobbying themes has been that Congress and the Administration should value the United States' strategic relationship with China too highly to risk endangering it for the sake of human rights or trade surpluses. President Bush, a former chief of the American liaison office in Beijing, is widely seen as particularly influenced by this argument.
 
Overestimation by Chinese
 But the Chinese consistently overestimate how much weight is given to such long-term considerations on Capitol Hill, said Warren W. Williams, the president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong. Mr. Williams has led a delegation to lobby Washington in support of the Chinese.
"Their fundamental lack of understanding of how things work in Washington, D.C., is a continuing surprise," he said.
Another Chinese lobbying tactic is to insist that China guarantees different human rights, including rights to food and shelter, than the the United States does. American officials, by this argument, should not judge a foreign country by their own standards.
Chinese officials also criticize American trade statistics showing that China shipped $15.1 billion worth of goods to the United States last year while importing products worth only $4.8 billion. Excluding Chinese exports that pass through Hong Kong, the trade is nearly in balance, Mr. Zhu contended. But this argument has not been persuasive in Washington, Mr. Williams said.
 
Attempt to Intimidate U.S.
 The last of China's four approaches to lobbying in Washington has been intimidation. "I have a fondness for the American people," Mr. Zhu said after his speech on Tuesday. "I really don't want to see West German or Japanese people there, taking over."
Business conditions for Americans in China are said to be deteriorating already. For three weeks, Chinese negotiators have been stalling in contract talks with American companies, said an American businessman with extensive contacts there, who spoke on condition that he not be identified. He said the Chinese negotiators were acting on Government instructions.
But in a possible change of tack, the New China News Agency said Saturday that China would send a buying mission to the United States, Reuters reported.
Some people in Washington question the credibility of Chinese threats to exclude American businesses and products. "They may not love capitalism; they may not love human rights, but they love money," Representative Pelosi said.

HEADLINE: Bush Cool to Having Gorbachev at Economic Meeting, Officials Say

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 12

 BODY:
President Bush is reluctant to grant President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's request to observe an economic conference of the seven leading industrial countries in London this summer, but is moving toward agreeing to a visit to Moscow late in June, officials said today.
Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev discussed both questions on Saturday during a 45-minute telephone call that Mr. Bush placed to Moscow from Camp David, Md., the officials said. 
 The call was part of increasingly complicated diplomatic maneuvers as the United States and the Soviet Union try to resolve arms-control disputes, schedule the much-delayed 1991 summit meeting, deal with Moscow's requests for economic assistance and lay the groundwork for moving forward in their overall relationship.
Administration officials said Mr. Bush had been troubled by the disputes over arms control and by what some of his advisers saw as a Soviet drift toward more authoritarian policies.
But they said the President was eager to help Mr. Gorbachev with his political and economic problems, and was especially inclined to find a way to meet with Mr. Gorbachev before the end of June and to grant the Soviet leader's request for $1.5 billion in guaranteed agricultural loans.
During the conversation on Saturday, Mr. Bush told Mr. Gorbachev that he would send a delegation of agricultural and economics expets to Moscow to help the Soviets find ways to alleviate food shortages and to search for ways to give Moscow financial aid.
"We have to find out what the basic problem is," a senior official said today, "and then, would food aid from abroad help?"
 
Seven-Nation Meeting
 Mr. Gorbachev raised the possibility of his going to London in July for the annual meeting of the so-called G-7, the seven most powerful industrial countries -- the United States, Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Japan. Mr. Bush did not reply, officials said today.
"We have mixed feelings about Gorbachev going to London," the senior official said. "We are very reluctant to agree to having him as an observer to the whole meeting, and I don't think that's in the cards."
But the official said the United States could support a plan under which Mr. Gorbachev would go to London to meet with the seven nations' leaders outside the formal conference framework. "The idea is to get him involved in a way that acquaints him with the international economic system, processes and so on, but doesn't bring him into the G-7," he said.
Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev said last year that they would hold another summit meeting in 1991 in Moscow, and the original date was to have been early in January. Mr. Bush postponed it because of the Persian Gulf crisis, arms-control disputes with Moscow and the Kremlin's crackdown in the Baltic republics.
The arms-control disputes center on American charges that the Soviet Union is cheating on a treaty reducing non-nuclear forces in Central Europe that was signed last November. The two sides are also at odds over the details of another treaty that would reduce long-range nuclear weapons.
For some time, American officials have said both problems must be cleared up before Mr. Bush will agree to the Moscow summit meeting, which was to have centered on the signing of the new nuclear weapons treaty.
But the United States and the Soviet Union have been maneuvering toward a compromise, and officials today said Mr. Bush was increasingly eager to find a way to hold the meeting. One approach, officials said, would be to drop the "arms control" umbrella for the meeting and discuss other issues.
"We're clearly more disposed toward a summit," an official said, "and we'll probably go in the third or fourth week of June. It will be just a summit for the sake of a summit. The President has already made clear that he's willing to meet irrespective of the types of agreements that may or may not be reached."
Officials here said that the United States was counting heavily on the visit this week by Gen. Mikhail Moiseyev, the chief of the Soviet General Staff. American officials are hoping he will bring a new proposal to end the deadlock on the conventional arms treaty.
Sergei Grigoryev, a Gorbachev spokesman, appearing on the ABC News program "This Week," said today, "I don't have a date, but I guess that in summer we will definitely have a summit.
"The feeling is that President Bush is expected in Moscow, to come and sign a treaty," he said.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Long-Term Interest Rates Resist Downward Pressure

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
After 10 months of recession, long-term interest rates remain stubbornly high, and a number of credit market analysts are beginning to wonder whether bond yields may have reached a trough in February, when they briefly dipped below 8 percent.
Persistently high long-term rates must be a source of concern at the Federal Reserve, which has aggressively pushed down short-term rates but has virtually no power to influence the direction of long-term bond yields. And as long as these bond rates remain high, recovery in important sectors like housing and capital spending will be muted or delayed. 
 Historically, bond yields tend to fall roughly one to four months after recessions bottom out, said Alan Sinai, president of Boston Company Economic Advisors Inc.
"It is conceivable that we have seen the lows in long-term rates," Mr. Sinai said, "but bond yields are typically stubborn in response to recession. That is particularly true in the United States, where we tend to be inflation prone."
Bond market participants reaffirmed their fear of inflation on Friday when they generated a fierce sell-off that pushed bond yields above 8.30 percent for the first time since early December.
The rise in long-term rates widened the gap between yields on two-year Treasury notes, which have declined in response to the Fed's moves, and those on 30-year bonds. The gap now is just under 1.50 percentage points. That is the widest difference, or spread, since 1985, analysts at the Wells Fargo Bank said.
The rise in long-term rates came despite a report from the Government showing that producer prices, excluding food and energy, rose by a modest two-tenths of a percent in April, the same rate of increase recorded in March.
The report was in line with market expectations, but was not persuasive enough for traders to want to hold on to huge amounts of Treasury securities accumulated at last week's spring refunding auctions.
"Bond market participants need a lot of information before they can be persuaded that inflation is coming down," Mr. Sinai said. "The history is that even as many as three good monthly reports are generally not enough."
Mr. Sinai and others say that they are convinced that more good inflation numbers are coming and that bond yields will fall in late summer.
Even if inflationary pressures do abate, analysts say that the ever-increasing load of new Treasury debt in coming months may in and of itself be sufficient to prevent long-term rates from falling.
Last week's $37 billion refunding was a record, but analysts said that because of the recession Treasury borrowing needs in the third and fourth quarters were likely to total some $200 billion.
 
'Dominant' Supply Aspect
 "The supply aspect is becoming dominant, and the prospect for the second half of the year is staggering," said Norman Robertson, chief economist at the Mellon National Bank in Pittsburgh. "It is getting harder to see a significant drop in bond yields as long as we experience these demands from the Treasury."
Steven A. Wood, director of financial markets research at the Bank of America, said: "I don't think the market has really focused on the extent of the supply that is coming. But over the next four to five months it will be a real tough chew."
Aside from the bill auctions, credit market participants do not have to worry about placing new Treasury debt this week. Instead, the focus will be on a slew of economic reports for April, beginning with industrial production data that the Fed is expected to release today. Data on retail sales and housing starts are also expected to be released this week.
 
Further Decline Seen
 In general, economists said the figures might dispel the notion that the economy is clawing its way out of recession. "I don't think we have hit bottom yet," said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at the Chase Manhattan Corporation. "I think the economy will decline for a few more months. And there is some risk that it could last longer than that."
For the bond market, the week's most important set of statistics is likely to come tomorrow, when consumer price data for April are expected. Few analysts are forecasting a repetition of the March report, when consumer prices declined by one-tenth of a percentage point. But most expect the figures will provide additional evidence that price pressures are moderating.
Mr. Fine and others project that the Consumer Price Index will show a rise of two-tenths of a percentage point for April, and a like amount once food and energy prices are excluded.
Given that the Federal Reserve cut the discount rate and reduced the overnight Federal funds rate another notch late last month, the Fed's policy-making Open Market Committee, which is scheduled to meet tomorrow, is not expected to take any important action, many analyst say.
"If I were advising the Fed, the only thing I would tell them is to keep their powder dry," said Mr. Wood of the Bank of America. "We have already seen that pushing down the funds rate is not going to bring bond yields down with it."

HEADLINE: First U.S. Troops Arrive in Bangladesh to Begin Large-Scale Relief Effort

BYLINE: By DAVID BINDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 12

 BODY:
A team of about 64 marines and Army Special Forces troops flew from Okinawa to Bangladesh today to begin preparing for a large-scale American relief effort in the cyclone-battered country.
The team is the vanguard of a disaster relief force of nearly 8,000 dispatched by the United States military on Saturday to aid survivors, ferry food and clothing by helicopter and set up water-purification centers. 
 A total of 4,660 marines and 3,000 sailors are due off the coast of Bangladesh by Wednesday aboard eight ships of a Navy amphibious group headed by the assault vessel Tarawa, the military said. Among them are Navy construction teams, known as Seabees.
The amphibious force was on its way back to California from the Persian Gulf, where it had been dispatched in early December to take part in the war against Iraq. It was never ordered into combat, said Lieut. Col. Thomas J. Boyd of the Air Force, who is a spokesman of the Pacific Comnmand.
 
Helicopters on the Way
 Colonel Boyd said a C-5 Galaxy transport plane had taken off from Hawaii carrying five Army UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters and 56 crew members and was due in Dhaka, the Bangladeshi capital, on Monday. In addition, several four-member teams of Air Force air-traffic controllers have been sent to Dhaka and members of an Army engineer battalion already working on public works projects in Bangladesh will be incorporated in the operations.
The spokesman said the amphibious vessels carried four types of helicopters for carrying food and medical supplies to people isolated on islands in the Bay of Bengal by the huge tides unleashed during the cyclone on April 30. They range from the CH-53 Sea Stallions and CH-46 Sea Knights to smaller UH-1N Iroquois and AH-1T Cobras.
Al Panico, director of international relief and development for the American Red Cross, said the effort represented a shift in United States Government disaster assistance policy. He said in an interview that in the past aid was usually confined to credits and funds provided to private relief agencies and occasionally included provision of air transport.
"Frankly, they didn't do it before," Mr. Pacino said. "Relief consisted of credits, food supplies, funds and 10 to 20 advisers. Nothing this massive. What is now changing, in northern Iraq and Bangladesh, is sending the military to provide some relief directly. When the military gets a mission, it's awesome. They have orders, command, resources, planes. Others wouldn't do it as fast. I think that's great."
Tom Drahman, director for Asia of CARE in New York, who testified here last week before a House committee on Bangladesh's special need for helicopter transport ships, said of the military relief effort: "We think this is very, very positive. These things can be used. This is a massive problem. It's not going to be solved overnight."
CARE has distributed plastic sheeting for shelter, five days' supplies of rice and molasses, and water supplies together with decontamination tablets to a total of more than 200,000 people in Bangladesh, he said.
Bangladesh officials now estimate that 138,000 people have died as a result of the cyclone and its aftermath.
Mr. Drahman noted that because of the vulnerability of Bangladesh to cyclones, its Government, CARE and relief organizations had positioned emergency supplies "with a very long shelf life" as part of a disaster preparedness strategy at various sites around the country. The problem now, he said, was to move those supplies to people in need.
"Transport, communications and the awful weather -- those are the major problems," he said. "I have been able to speak just twice to Bangladesh on the telephone." It is unclear how much the American military relief effort may cost. The United States has already contributed $7.2 million in assistance and is scheduled to redirect another $2 million already planned for Bangladesh for disaster aid.
 
Officers Plan Campaign
DHAKA, Bangladesh, May 12 (AP) -- A half-dozen American military officers plan to visit Chittagong on Monday to see whether the cyclone-shattered seaport can accommodate their fleet and to start figuring out how best to deploy their troops.
"We've got equipment here to make pure water out of salt water, out of contaminated water," said Maj. Dave Sebastian of the Marines. "We can take almost mud and make it drinkable."
Major Sebastian, a 39-year-old engineer from Orlando, Fla., said the marines would probably set up several water-purification points close to food distribution centers established by foreign and local relief teams along the coutry's badly damaged southeastern coast.
The advance team that arrived today from Okinawa is under the command of Maj. Gen. Henry Stackpole of the Marines. He spent the day conferring with Bangladeshi Government leaders and American Embassy officials.
Another flight from Okinawa was expected to reach Dhaka tonight, carrying about 30 more engineers and communications personnel. Also on the flights were medics who will try to keep the task force from getting sick.
The area where the task force will be working is a nightmare of health hazards. The diarrhea ravaging flood survivors, especially babies and small children, can be fatal because of the rapid dehydration it induces.
Bangladeshi relief workers have already warned of the danger of a cholera epidemic.
 
New Cyclone Is Feared
DHAKA, Bangladesh, May 12 (Reuters) -- Weather officials reported the threat of a new cyclone today. They said a low depression in the Andaman Sea, 800 miles south of Chittagong, could turn into a new storm that might hit the country in the next two days.
"We don't want to take any chances," said Abdur Rub Khan, an official in Chittagong. "We have told people to stay alert."
Finance Minister Saifur Rahman said that the first cyclone cost Bangladesh $3 billion in economic losses and that nearly four million people had been made virtually destitute.
The Dhaka weather office said rivers all over the country were still rising.

Far From an Arid Economy, Desert States Thrive

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PHOENIX

 BODY:
The Phoenician Hotel, where there is not much of a waiting list for its $4,000-a-night suites, stands in suburban Scottsdale in all its ostentatious splendor, a glittering monument to the savings and loan debacle, a hangover from the reckless building spree of the 1980's.
In a city that once knew no limits, perhaps 3 of every 10 offices now sit empty. Housing prices are flat. 
 But nothing, it seems, can stop growth in the desert. Indeed, the excesses of the past could seed an even more abundant future as the building glut provides a fast and relatively inexpensive way for more companies and people to claim stakes amid the cactus. In the past year, Arizona, the 24th-largest state, jumped from 35th to 7th in the rate of creating jobs.
The growth here and in Nevada, Utah and New Mexico is a testament to the drawing power of the American desert, a region that thrives as a terminus, and often a turnstile, for people looking for a new start, another roll of the dice. It has become the new California, a place where palm trees and the desert still beckon dreamers.
Even in the depths of the real estate crisis in parts of the region, jobs and people continued to increase. And today, this land of the sun, sand and mesquite has become even more attractive.
The sharpest growth is occurring in Nevada, which has led the nation in employment and population growth for five consecutive years. Utah climbed to sixth in job creation last year, and sees rosier prospects on the horizon. Even New Mexico, one of the poorest states in the country, outpaced the national average in job growth in 1990.
"Businesses today have a lot more freedom about where they want to locate," especially the high-technology companies, said Phillip Burgess, president of the Center for the New West, a research organization. "And employers who need to recruit highly educated technical specialists are going to have a lot more luck convincing somebody to come to the desert. It's simply where people want to be."
But growth does not come without pain, and there are already signs that this region will have to work harder in the 90's to achieve the growth rate of the 80's. In Nevada, there was some slowing in the rate last year, and a shortage of water could be stifling.
Traffic has begun to grow wearisome around Phoenix, and more cars mean more pollution. And the low tax rates throughout the desert, which drew so many migrants, could ultimately prove to be a mirage. With dwindling treasuries and rising costs associated with growth, these states are now considering what had been a taboo: raising taxes.
 
Migration
A Swift Stream Of Californians
For generations, the lifeblood of the desert has been migration, and most of this growth has come from the Midwest and East. But in recent years, a bigger share has come from California, where high costs have been pushing people to bargains in nearby states.
"We think of ourselves very much as an extension of Southern California," said Lee McPhetters, the associate dean in the College of Business at Arizona State University in Tempe. "Ten years ago, there was an aversion to that. But so many of the people in the desert are from somewhere else themselves -- 25 percent of the people in Arizona weren't here a decade ago -- that people don't throw up barriers against 'outsiders' coming in."
Bill Hunter, a regional credit manager for Reynolds Metals, which moved its credit office from Southern California to Scottsdale last August, said: "The noise, the traffic, the crime -- it's just getting to be too much in California. And in Arizona, you can get more house for half the money."
Even places like St. George, a growing city of 28,000 in southwestern Utah, counts about 1,000 new settlers from California in the past year.
Some of the Californians, called "equity migrants," have sold homes for $500,000 or more and find much cheaper replacements in the desert. Ray Jones, the vice president of a civil engineering company in Las Vegas, sold his home in Orange County for $1.3 million and bought a house in Nevada for $400,000.
How do the houses compare? "The one in Las Vegas is much nicer," he said.
 
Haven for the Rich
 More than a generation ago, the artist Georgia O'Keeffe was drawn to New Mexico by its haunting beauty. Now Sante Fe is a haven for the rich, famous and creative. The actor Val Kilmer, the contemporary artist Bruce Naumann and others have recently become residents of Sante Fe.
The state has grown, as well, with the influx of people drawn by the natural beauty who "telecommute" to offices in faraway big cities. Dick Spray, an executive with a golf course design company in California, uses a computer and fax machine to communicate with his office while he works in an adobe house overlooking Taos Valley.
"My office is 10 feet from my bed," said Mr. Spray, who moved to Taos two years ago from the San Francisco area. "The fax machine made this whole adventure viable for me."
Throughout the desert, the population tends to be younger than elsewhere around the country, despite an image of the desert states' being filled with retirees content in the warm, gentle breezes.
In part, the population in desert states has stayed young because many here, among them American Indians, Hispanic people and Mormons, have relatively high birth rates. Arizona, for example, has a median age slightly below the national average of 33.
"In general, people who move tend to be younger, between 25 and 35, because they don't have the established ties," said Steve Happel, a professor of economics at Arizona State University. "And they're more likely to be looking for changes in their lives."
The migration to the desert differs in another important way. In most parts of the country, people follow jobs. In the desert region, with its stunning beauty and sunshine that accommodates tennis players 300 days a year, people often move first and find a job later.
"People in other parts of the country get discouraged and call U-Haul," said Jerry Jordan, chief economist for First Interstate Bancorp, which is based in Los Angeles but has underwritten much of the recent construction in the desert region. "They figure, 'If I've got to live in a tent, I might as well live someplace nice.' "
 
Real Estate
Early to Fall, Early to Rise
The overbuilding boom of the mid-1980's, and the savings and loan collapse that followed, were especially dramatic in Arizona, New Mexico and Utah. Developers built here for the same reason that Willie Sutton robbed banks: This was where the money was.
But the building craze, which was fed by the 1981 Federal tax law that made real estate investment hugely profitable, came to a halt with the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and the evaporation of capital.
The grandiose Phoenician Hotel, built by Charles H. Keating's now-failed Lincoln Savings and Loan of Irvine, Calif., became a symbol of this intoxicating time for builders and, when it was taken over by Government savings and loan regulators, a symbol of the boom going bust.
Since 1987, 10 of 11 savings and loans in Arizona have failed.
 
Seeing the Light
 In some ways, the real estate collapse here in the late 1980's was a harbinger for the slide in New York, Boston and other cities in the Northeast.
"We've already been through what is now occurring in New York, Boston and elsewhere," said Kelly Matthews, an economist at First Security Corporation in Salt Lake City. "We've turned the corner on our real estate problems."
Indeed, the desert states fared much better in construction employment last year than the nation as a whole, which saw a drop of 8.6 percent in building jobs.
Utah had a 6.3 percent increase in construction jobs last year. Construction employment in Nevada slowed a bit, but still grew by 4.6 percent. Arizona and New Mexico lost construction jobs last year, but at a rate of only about 1 percent.
In some important ways, the savings and loan crisis will end up helping the economies of places like Phoenix, where overbuilding has left a surfeit of relatively cheap office space. While that surplus is bad news for landholders -- in many cases, the Federal receivers now running the holdings of bankrupt financial institutions -- it is good news for companies seeking to move.
"When we come out of this recession, and companies start to grow again, these cheaper rents are going to make places like Phoenix very attractive," said Edward Hill, a professor of economics at Cleveland State University. "In a sense, it's the taxpayers' money that will help make Phoenix more competitive."
 
'Cold Water' in Nevada
 Nevada escaped the building glut, in large part, because it grew so fast that builders could scarcely keep pace. While construction foundered elsewhere, many building trades workers and laborers flocked to Las Vegas, drawn by work on the new Mirage and Excalibur casinos and a flurry of home building.
Now some have been idled, as the pace of building in Nevada has slowed. Lenders, wary of the building spree of Arizona, have "thrown cold water" on the real estate market there, said Mr. Jordan, the economist with First Interstate Bancorp.
"We've got some men who are waiting for work," said George Dunckhurst, president of the Laborers Union 872 in Las Vegas. "We've got a waiting list of about nine pages, with about 39 workers to a page."
The lending crunch, as developers call it, has delayed several projects in Las Vegas. "As a consequence, we've got a lot of pent-up demand for homes," said Glenn Barton, manager of the Las Vegas division of the Meyers Group, a real estate consulting company.
That demand has helped pushed up housing prices in Nevada. In Las Vegas, for example, the median price of a home has risen to $123,000, from $105,000, in two years. In Phoenix, meanwhile, the median-price home is about $84,000, and people are fortunate if it has increased in value. In the late 1980's, housing prices fell as much as 30 percent.
"People aren't playing the speculation game here anymore," said Jeff Burt, vice president of the Greater Phoenix Economic Council, a group that recruits new businesses. "They're buying homes because they represent good values, and because they've got some long-term interests here. And that's much healthier for our region."
 
Tourism
Work and Play Under the Sun
The economy of the Southwest, it was once said, rested on the four "C's": copper, cattle, cotton and climate.
Before air-conditioning, the desert sun was a curse. But as more and more Americans choose to work and live where they can also play, the desert climate has generated far more dollars than the other three C's put together.
Few regions can compete with the desert states for sightseeing and recreation, from year-round sunshine to all-night slot machines. It is a factor that already tips the scales in the recruiting efforts of many companies, and it will grow more important.
As members of the baby-boom generation grow older, they are reaching the time of life when their salaries are highest and, with children reaching adulthood, their financial responsibilities are largely satisfied. The result is more money and time for leisure.
The beauty of the Grand Canyon, Carlsbad Caverns and Zion National Park have been drawing tourists, and their money, for generations. More recently, a growing chunk has been spent at the gaming tables in Nevada.
 
The Lure of Las Vegas
 Tourism in the desert region generated $23.3 billion last year, up significantly from the $13.1 billion in 1984. In Nevada, tourism accounts for a whopping 80 percent of revenue. Nationally, tourism accounts for about 6.7 percent of the gross national product; in the desert, tourism represents nearly 19 percent of the economy's revenues.
Some economists once speculated that Las Vegas would suffer if the rest of the country legalized gambling. But people can now gamble in Deadwood, S.D., Atlantic City, on a riverboat on the Mississippi River or stay at home and play the state lottery. The explosion in gambling has only heightened the attraction of Las Vegas.
"It's allowed Las Vegas to say, 'Hey, gambling isn't so bad, you have it in your hometown,' " said Bill Thompson, a professor of management at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas and an expert on the economics of gaming. "It's really stimulated an interest in gambling. And Las Vegas is the capital, the mecca, so people want to come here."
But far from the casinos of Las Vegas, the desert region is profiting on its tourist attractions. Salt Lake City is competing for the 1998 Winter Olympics. And places like Sante Fe, the 17th-fastest growing metropolitan region in the nation, have cashed in on the surrounding beauty and cultural offerings.
 
Limits
Foundations To Be Built
"The great playground of the white American," D. H. Lawrence once called the Southwest.
Not everyone in the desert is pleased that the region has become such a magnet. They see elements of class and race exploitation.
In some cases, the arrival of affluent newcomers has pushed rents beyond the reach of the Indians and Hispanic people who have lived there for generations. And newcomers are not always tolerant of the native ways. In Taos County, for example, affluent newcomers have sought to close a molybdenum mine, fearing that it damages the environment. They were less concerned about the paychecks of the hundreds of Hispanic workers whose ancestors also toiled in the mines.
"The Southwest has become a commodity to be bought and sold," said Joseph C. Wilder, director of the Southwest Center, a research unit at the University of Arizona. "It's a place that's easily romanticized."
During the whirlwind of the 1980's here, planning for the future did not usually mean preparing for the next decade, or even the next year. More often, it meant next Tuesday. But economists say that lack of planning may limit growth in the future.
"We have enough buildings for this millennium," said Mr. Jordan, the economist with First Interstate Bancorp, "but we have neglected the infrastructure, water, sewer, education, and it could put a cap on growth."
 
Dread of New Taxes
 The relatively low level of taxes attracted many people and companies to the desert. But the tax base did not keep up with growth, and now the desert states are struggling to provide services with dwindling coffers.
Every state in the desert region has discussed raising taxes. But since that might discourage newcomers, the governments are groping for more innovative, and less painful, ways to pay the bills. In Arizona, for example, many governmental services have been turned over to private companies in the belief that they can do more with less public money. But it will not be easy.
"If you don't put enough money into schools, for example, some people are going to decide not to move to Arizona," Mr. Jordan said.
In recent years, the desert economy has moved toward greater diversification, but it is still vulnerable.
In New Mexico, about 15 percent of paychecks are drawn on the Federal Government, much of them for military and energy research. While economists there say the research-oriented Government work will probably be spared in military cutbacks, it is by no means a certainty.
And the growth in Las Vegas, which depends on a single industry, has no guarantee of security.
"Las Vegas isn't exactly a one-industry town, but it comes pretty close," said R. Keith Schwer, director of the Center of Business and Economic Research at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas. "If New Orleans or Florida should legalize gambling, then we could be in serious trouble."
But economists generally foresee long and strong growth for the desert states. As Elliot Pollack, president of Epic Enterprises, a real estate consulting company in Phoenix, put it: "If a company is going to pick a city for a new office, do you think they'll pick someplace like Boston, which is fairly staid, or Arizona, which has had 100 years of strong growth, and prospects for more?"

The New Prague Spring

BYLINE: By JACK ROSENTHAL

DATELINE: PRAGUE

 BODY:
The raw new politics of free Czechoslovakia are contained by the magisterial stature of a president who transcends politics. Chalked on a wall on Zatecka Street is a heart, containing the words "Vaclav Havel." Is there another country in the world where a political leader enjoys such popularity? The raw new economic freedoms, meanwhile, seem to be popping out everywhere.
A story told at dinner: How are things going in the former Soviet satellite countries compared with the Soviet Union? Ivan Lamper, editor of Respekt, a leading political journal, answers with a story. Two travelers, one in Paris and one in Moscow, set off by plane for the other capital. Bad weather forces both planes to land in Warsaw. When the travelers get off, they both think they have reached their final destination. 
 Prague, too, may look like Paris to a Soviet traveler; but to a Western visitor, it doesn't look like Moscow at all, most of all because it seems to brim with anxious optimism.
An emigre's view: Jiri Horak left for New York when the Communists took over in 1948 and established himself as a political scientist. In 1989, he came back to help re-establish the Social Democratic Party, which he now chairs. One way that things have changed: "In the past, every Czech wanted to be a musician. Now everyone wants to be an entrepreneur."
A street scene in Prague: "Look at that!" On a busy downtown street, a young American woman who has been teaching in Czechoslovakia since last fall rushes with astonishment to a vendor's stand labeled "Kelly Fruit." Not for months has she seen such produce: Avocados! Artichokes! Mangoes, selling for 150 crowns, or about $5.
Suddenly, a little old lady in a blue hat interrupts. "Oh, no! Too expensive!" she exclaims in German. "Yes, they have these things now, but who can afford them? This is what ordinary people can afford." She presses her thumb over the zero in "150" -- and a dozen passers-by stop and applaud. A small, neat market metaphor. Goods long dreamed of are available but few can pay the price.
Another street scene in Prague: Dozens of electric trams clatter past, all painted drab beige and maroon. Then, with a clang, another one passes in a streak of color. It is painted entirely in shocking pink except for the slash of stylish black script that proclaims "Minolta."
A store scene in Prague: One byproduct of the new freedoms felt since the Velvet Revolution is pornography, long forbidden. Now, a bookstore on smart Pariecka Street displays, next to a "Tom a Jerry" book, a new translation of the old classic: "Fanny Hillova, Memoary Kurtizany." Skin magazines are sold on street corners and lurid pin-ups appear even in shops staffed by women. Don't they object? "Well," says one female clerk with an effort to be understanding, "it was illegal for so long."
A store scene in Bratislava: In the Prior department store, a resident notices two dramatic changes. Where once there were bare pipes and drab lighting now there are posters, plastic flowers and streamers. The other change is on the shelves. They sport, for instance, six feet of "Milford Tea" and three of "Pril," an Austrian dishwashing liquid. The displays probably contain the entire stock -- but that's surely more appealing than shelves that stay empty because there's nothing to put on them.
A street scene in Bratislava: On a main street, whose stores include two fashionable jewelers, pedestrians recoil from two burly men in black uniforms and boots, packing billy clubs and two-way radios and accompanied by a big black dog on a chain. Who are these men? Some sort of secret police?
"Oh, no, they're not political," says a politician. "They're what we call 'black sheriffs.' With the start of private ownership, there's been more crime. So owners hire these people. Like security guards. Like America."

HEADLINE: Chastise China; Don't Isolate It

 BODY:
By June 3, President Bush must tell Congress whether he wants China's "most favored nation" trading privileges extended for another year. Congress has three months to weigh any such request. At stake are billions in commerce, a million jobs in China and thousands in the U.S.
America has nothing to gain from inflicting economic harm on China or reducing its trade. But this yearly decision on trade privileges gives Washington its best opportunity to exert leverage on human rights, arms sales and other issues. The ideal way to use that leverage now would be a conditional renewal, making future trade relations turn on China's willingness to respond to specific U.S. concerns. 
 China has, in fact, responded to some concerns expressed in last year's trade debate. Most of the Chinese imprisoned for taking part in the 1989 Democracy Movement have now been brought to trial, as Americans demanded. Chinese courts imposed long sentences simply for advocating basic freedoms, sentences now being served under extremely harsh conditions. Yet by Chinese standards, punishment was relatively lenient. Recently, a few high-visibility prisoners have been released.
Even so, China's hard-line leaders continue to misread Western attitudes and act in ways that seem calculated to provoke trade retaliation. They export missiles and nuclear technology in violation of their own past pledges. They promote the use of prison labor to produce low-cost exports -- a practice they now promise to cease. They blatantly violate computer software copyrights, asserting that being underdeveloped entitles them to do so. Such methods have helped push the U.S. trade deficit with China to $15 billion.
These provocations might justify revoking the special waiver that allows China to enjoy most-favored-nation privileges despite its failure to qualify as a market economy or as a country permitting free emigration. Alternatively, some in Congress now propose rigid conditions that, realistically, China could not be expected to meet.
Such actions would indeed punish China's leadership. They would also inflict serious economic damage on the Chinese economy, particularly to the special economic zones along the south China coast opposite Hong Kong and Taiwan.
But that's just the problem. Punishing the neo-Stalinist octogenarians now dominant in Beijing won't loosen their grip. But they will, inevitably, pass from the scene, and the last thing the U.S. should do pending a succession crisis is weaken market-oriented regions and personalities by a period of enforced economic isolation.
Mr. Bush and Congress have a better alternative. They can approve renewal -- but attach provisions requiring that when the next 12-month period expires the President report to Congress on Beijing's performance in the areas of trade-law infringements, weapons proliferation, free emigration, prison labor and political imprisonment, and base his 1992 recommendation on this performance.
Even if the President's 1992 report showed disappointing Chinese performance, Mr. Bush could still recommend a further renewal of trade privileges. But he would have to justify that in an election year.
China is flouting U.S. law and values and that warrants a sharp rebuke. But to cut off trade would be to put today's desire for emotional satisfaction ahead of tomorrow's hope for substantive change. Renewal of the agreement, with a reporting requirement, is the better choice.

HEADLINE: HORSE RACING;
Owners Gain an Inside Track

BYLINE: By JOSEPH DURSO

 BODY:
It has been 13 years since a horse won the Triple Crown, with Affirmed prevailing in three stirring duels against Alydar, who lost the Kentucky Derby by a neck, the Preakness by a nose and the Belmont Stakes by an eyebrow.
Now, six months after Alydar died at the age of 15, renowned as the race horse who would not surrender, only one horse in America has a chance to win the Triple Crown in 1991: a son of Alydar named Strike the Gold. 
 To his public, Strike the Gold is the colt who dethroned last year's juvenile champion, Fly So Free. To his trainer, Nick Zito, he is "a horse of destiny."
To his owners, three New York businessmen and golfing partners led by B. Giles Brophy, Strike the Gold is the principal resource in a world that is relatively new to them.
In fact, Strike the Gold's entourage is riding what seems to be the wave of the future in racing: outsiders who invest in horses and also race them. And like Thomas Valando, a music publisher who owns Fly So Free, and Carl Icahn, a financier who owns Meadow Star, Brophy personifies these new horsemen; he is a salesman of Holstein cattle and Government securities who now has a share of the hottest horse in the 3-year-old classics.
Strike the Gold carried his three owners one-third of the way toward their ultimate goal when he won the Kentucky Derby on May 4. He will aim for the second part of the crown next Saturday when he runs in the Preakness at Pimlico Race Course in Maryland.
And, if he is still striding toward the goal that eluded his distinguished sire by inches, he will face the final test three weeks later in the mile-and-a-half Belmont.
"Alydar changed the whole picture as a sire," trainer Scotty Schulhofer said the other day at the Belmont barn of Fly So Free, who twice in the last month lost crucial races to the son of Alydar.
One man who could not agree more is Brophy, who with his partners bought Strike the Gold last year from Calumet Farm about four months before Alydar died. Brophy's partners are William J. Condren, an investor in real estate and oil and a part owner of the sprinter Housebuster, and Joseph M. Cornacchia, a publisher of games like Trivial Pursuit and other blockbusters.
"Everybody has a place in the universe," Brophy said recently. "But they haven't found the spot in the universe for Alydar. You saw him battle Affirmed, stride for stride, without being defeated mentally. And that's what is special about Strike the Gold. They don't make any more Alydars."
When he isn't poring over pedigree charts or performance charts, Brophy is poring over economic charts, either in his office on East 57th Street in Manhattan, in his homes on Fifth Avenue and in Palm Beach, Fla., and Westhampton, L.I., or on his cattle and horse farm in Yorktown Heights in Westchester County.
 
Canyons of Finance
 Brophy is a stocky 53-year-old New Yorker with close wavy hair and blue eyes and a forceful manner, and he gives the distinct impression that not much happens to him by chance. He was raised in Bay Shore, L.I., studied at Hofstra University, earned a graduate degree in business at New York University and headed straight into the canyons of finance.
But Brophy's life changed when he headed into the canyons of raising cattle and buying race horses.
It seems indisputable that Giles Brophy has the golden touch, and some people even suggest he has the flair for executing business coups with the best of them. He laughed at the thought the other day, saying:
"I'm no wheeler-dealer. I'm a pretty conservative guy. If I were scouting myself, I'd say, 'He's persistent, intense about the things he wants to do.' They wrote in my yearbook at Bay Shore High, 'Patience is a virtue not oft deterred.' Was it fair? I have no idea. I didn't know what they were getting at. But let's hope it keeps up."
He is persistent and intense, all right and in business and finance, he has built a track record for dash that even his famous horse might envy.
 
Flip of the Coin
 In 1960, for example, he "decided to go into the securities business," so he flipped a coin to see if he would take a job at Citibank or United States Trust. Citibank won the toss. Later, he founded the securities company of Brophy Gestal Knight & Company and built it into a winner as an institutional bond house. Three years ago, he sold it to the Sanwa Bank of Japan.
"Then I went to Florida and took six or seven months off," he said. "But then I wanted to get back to work. So, I set up another securities firm. I had sold my name along with the firm to the Japanese, so I called the new company Giles Securities.
"This was last year, and by then I was spending a lot of my time with my horses. Animals were always important to me. When I was a kid, I wanted to be a veterinarian. Later, I got into the cattle business, around 1973, registered Holsteins, raised them on my 250-acre farm in Yorktown Heights.
"Horses? I got interested in them once when my wife and I were hunting bear and moose in Alaska. I decided I better learn to ride a horse to mount the hills. So, I bought a jumper for myself and one for my wife. Got into steeplechase riding. And, in 1984, race horses."
But as with his Government bonds and Holstein cattle, the race horses were ones with pedigrees. His first coup was Thirty-Six Red, a son of Slew o' Gold, who won the Gotham and the Wood Memorial in New York last year. But Brophy and Zito were disappointed when the colt ran eighth in the Kentucky Derby, so they promised to take the Blue Grass route to Kentucky next time they had a Derby horse.
They didn't have to wait long. One day last summer, Brophy was approached by Condren, his longtime golfing friend from the Deepdale Club and National Golf Links on Long Island, who proposed pooling their interests with Condren's friend Cornacchio. And while each man kept separate interests in some horses, they formed a partnership to buy and race some others, and naturally struck gold.
Brophy and Zito pored over bloodlines and decided to buy five fillies and one colt from Calumet Farm. Then one day Zito telephoned to warn Brophy that a colt he was training was going to be auctioned in January as part of a dispersal sale by Calumet. The colt was Strike the Gold, a son of Alydar, and Brophy wrote a check "in the low seven-figures" and bought all seven young horses.
So, now he is two races away from making history. Can Strike the Gold go on and win the Triple Crown?
"Very definitely," he said, defending his own unique horse. "Remember who his father was."

HEADLINE: U.S. Sees Trade as Spur

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 13

 BODY:
International trade will continue to stimulate global economic growth, but at a slower rate this year before picking up momentum in 1992, the Bush Administration said today.
"World trade growth should continue to run at its historical rate of just over twice the pace of output growth, or 2.5 percent in 1991 and around 5.5 percent in 1992," it said in its "Annual Trade Projection Report to Congress." 
 "Thus, international trade will remain an important source of stimulus and support for output growth," it added.
The Administration is counting on demand for American goods by overseas nations to help pull the economy out of the recession. Exports accounted for about 40 percent of the economy's growth last year.
The gross national product of the industrialized nations will rise from about 1 percent this year to 2.5 percent to 3 percent in 1992, the report said. The G.N.P. is the total value of a nation's goods and services.
Growth among the lesser-developed countries is expected to increase slightly less than 1 percent this year and about 3.5 percent in 1992.

The Drug Makers' Defense on Costs

BYLINE: By Milt Freudenheim

 BODY:
PHARMACEUTICAL executives jousted with Government economists last week over a draft report to Congress that questions the drug industry's main justification for charging thousands of dollars per patient annually for some drugs.
The companies say they have to set high prices to recoup heavy costs of finding and testing a new drug and obtaining Food and Drug Administration approval. The Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, a trade group, often cites a 1987 estimate of $231 million. 
 Economists at the Office of Technology Assessment, a Congressional advisory bureau, said in the draft report that such numbers were unverifiable, if not meaningless. Critics say the estimates involve guesses about the rates of success and failure in finding new drugs, the time expended, and the cost, in theory, of borrowing money.
At a meeting last week of the technology office's Advisory Panel on Pharmaceutical Research, drug industry spokesmen insisted that the high estimates were basically correct, even if they could not be verified. "You do know the order of magnitude," said Judy C. Lewent, chief financial officer and vice president with Merck & Company, the world's largest drug company.
"Success rates are highly dependent on the state of knowledge about a compound at the start" of a research project, said Jacob Stucki, who retired as vice president for research at the Upjohn Company. He said drug companies often had a "much greater success rate with compounds acquired from outside" laboratories. The up-front costs for such drugs and royalties later are not counted with research in company financial statements.
Ms. Lewent and George B. Rathmann, the retired chairman of Amgen, a biotechnology company in Thousand Oaks, Calif., conceded that not enough was known about the cost of developing a drug. "By the time you get the story right, it's out of date," said Mr. Rathmann, who has moved on to found Icos, a start-up biotechnology company.
Another panel member, Lewis A. Engman, a Washington lawyer and former president of the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, said that he had often cited the estimates of research costs, but that even ball park figures were enough to show that the number was large. "Granted that there are many variables and we don't know what they are," he said, "does it matter if the estimate is $250 million, or even $400 million?"
Nancy L. Buc, a Washington lawyer who is a former chief counsel with the F.D.A., identified the political stakes: "If the number is seen as really big, it is less distressing to politicians to allow returns that are seen as perhaps too big." Otherwise, she said, Congress might decide to "tinker with taxes" paid by drug companies.
At a time of rising alarm about health-care costs, these are not idle concerns. Robert B. Helms, a former executive director of the American Pharmaceutical Institute, an industry-sponsored policy group, said there was talk in Washington of adopting European-style controls on drug prices or even subjecting pharmaceuticals to "public utility regulation." To discourage such ideas, he said, the technology office report should cite the savings that drugs permit by taking the place of even more costly hospital care.
Economists say the companies spend heavily for research because the payoffs can be enormous. Ms. Lewent of Merck said increased profits would be "chased by research and development costs" as long as the companies had the money. Merck plans to spend $1 billion this year for research and development. Mr. Rathmann, who recently helped raise $30 million for Icos from investors, said they hoped for a return in 10 years of "42 percent compounded." He added: "If there had not been profitability, there would not be a biotech industry today. The products would not be out there."
Dr. M. Leigh Thompson, a group vice president with Eli Lilly & Company, said medical needs, not economics, were the starting point for drug research. He added that spending on research and development by the drug industry, which was $9.2 billion last year, was less than 2 percent of the $676 billion in national spending on health care.
Ms. Lewent said, "The science opportunities that the industry now sees are orders of magnitude greater than have been seen for a long time." She added, "The hard core issue" is that pharmaceuticals are "an industry that shows itself to be adding to social returns in a competitive environment."
But Jeffrey Levi, a representative of AIDS Action, a patient advocacy group, said the Congressional technology office economists should ask: "Are the companies producing drugs that are accessible to the people who need them?"

Hunt Transport At a Crossroads

BYLINE: By Agis Salpukas

 BODY:
FOR most of the last 10 years, J. B. Hunt Transport Services Inc. has thrived under the freedoms brought by the deregulation of the trucking industry in 1980.
A nonunion carrier, it benefited from lower costs, an absence of union work rules, and an aggressive management that knew how to exploit the opportunities created when hundreds of older unionized companies failed. Hunt, based in Lowell, Ark., saw its revenues grow to $579 million in 1990 from less than $100 million in the early 1980's. Hunt is the second-largest full-truck-load long-haul carrier, behind Schneider National Inc. of Green Bay, Wis. 
 The company became a favorite of investors and analysts, whose reports helped push the price of the stock up to $33 a share in 1987, from an average in the low teens in 1985. It closed at $19.75 yesterday in over-the-counter trading.
In recent years, Hunt has sustained growth of about 15 percent a year, but it expects to find it more difficult now to meet that target.
When it faced a severe shortage of drivers, the company parked many trucks and then raised its pay rate to 33 cents a mile last year, from 25 cents a mile in 1987. The raises brought a flood of applicants, from which Hunt was able to pick the best, but its cost advantage over union carriers and other nonunion carriers has lessened.
At the same time, its customers, like Ford Motor and Reynolds Metals, have become tougher. They are resisting rate increases and demanding better on-time service, particularly customers that are running their plants on just-in-time inventory deliveries. The recession has also caused many customers to take a sharper look at their haulers.
"They just had open-ended growth opportunities," said Paul R. Schlesinger, the trucking analyst for Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Inc. "As they could add equipment, they could fill it at decent rates."
But competitors were also adding equipment, which put pressure on prices, making it difficult for truckers to make price increases stick, despite rising labor and fuel costs.
Hunt's operating costs soared from 77 percent of total revenue in 1986 to 90.2 percent in 1990. At the same time, freight rates were steady until last year, when the industry was able to push through a 3 percent rise. "They're at the crossroads," Mr. Schlesinger said. "They've discovered that the growth that they had been counting on will not do the job."
As a result, the management has entered new areas of trucking where Hunt has not shown the expertise it demonstrated in the long-haul, full-truckload market.
Last year the carrier made its first acquisition of a company since 1978. It bought Bulldog Trucking, a short-haul trucking company in the Southeast, based in Carnesville, Ga., to spearhead its drive into the short-haul market.
From 50 to 70 percent of freight is considered short-haul, thus providing a huge market for growth. Hunt is betting that its large size and reputation will enable it to gain market share quickly in a segment that is dominated by small trucking companies.
Hunt also plans to build up its flatbed business, through which it hauls mostly building materials, another highly decentralized business dominated by owner-operators or small companies.
Also, instead of competing in major corridors with railroads, which have made big improvements in the cost of hauling truck containers, Hunt has formed a partnership with the Santa Fe Railway for some of its long-haul business.
Kirk Thompson, president and chief executive of Hunt, said that about one-third of Hunt's business was for hauls of less than 500 miles. "This is not anything particularly new to us," he added.
He said Hunt had been able to persuade some of its Fortune 500 customers, who use it for long hauls, to turn over their short-haul freight to the company, because many prefer limiting the number of vendors they use.
He contended that with its investments in trucks and terminals and with a reputation on which it could now cash in, the company would not have trouble growing in the 90's.
"We took the risk and availed ourselves of the opportunities in the 1980's," he said, "and now we have new opportunity in the 1990's." He added that the industry was resistant to economic slowdowns, commenting, "You can live without frozen yogurt, but you can't live without transportation."
Some analysts suggest that Hunt may even benefit from the recession, because it could lead to the failure of more carriers, giving the stronger companies an opportunity to pick up more customers.
Mr. Thompson also argues that the larger companies have built up such an advantage over smaller truckers that it would be hard to catch up with the efficiencies that a large carrier has.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Dozens of Agencies Pursue Three Japanese Car Makers

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
ALTHOUGH car and truck sales in the United States remain mired in a slump severe enough to sadden any glad-handing dealer, the appeal of creating vehicle advertising remains strong enough to entice more than two dozen agencies into eagerly pursuing three Japanese auto makers.
Subaru of America is expected to name a short list of finalists sometime this week in the monthlong review of its $60 million account, now handled by Levine, Huntley, Vick & Beaver. American Isuzu Motors is seeking an agency for its car and truck account, valued at $74 million to $100 million, to replace Della Femina, McNamee, which it dismissed Thursday after an 11-year relationship. 
 And in the realm of possibility, agency executives say Mazda Motor of America is continuing to plan a luxury car line code-named Pegasus. If that car, which has involved preliminary discussions with agencies, is introduced, it could mean initial annual ad spending of $60 million to $75 million.
Combined total billings of the three accounts exceed $200 million -- as much as an agency that would rank around 43d among all shops in the United States would have.
Of course, no one agency could serve all three, given the insurmountable competitive conflicts that would ensue. Yet even singly, the billings at issue are magnetic, especially during a recession that has touched off a feeding frenzy among income-starved agencies for whatever sizable pieces of new business become available.
Apart from the financial implications, an added draw makes an automotive account attractive to just about every agency without one. Call it the lure of the open road.
"A car is one of those things that's bigger than life," said Mark Goldstein, president of Earle Palmer Brown Advertising, the Bethesda, Md., agency that is among those identified as being on the long list of Subaru contenders. "It adds a tremendous cachet to your business. You can park a car in front of your building. You can't park a box of Tide in front of your building."
So overwhelming is the desire for auto business that even allied fields bask in a halo effect. When Avis Car Leasing announced the selection yesterday of six finalists on its $30 million-plus account, now being handled by Backer Spielvogel Bates, Robert Cardillo, vice president of sales and marketing, noted that the car-rental company began its review with a list of 120 agencies.
Besides Backer, the finalists, all based in New York, are DDB Needham Worldwide, D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles, FCB/Leber Katz Partners, McCann-Erickson and TBWA Advertising. A decision is expected in mid-June.
Servicing a car account is "almost synonymous" with an agency's being regarded by potential clients and its peers as substantial and significant, said Richard Costello, president of TBWA, which is also considered to be among the ranks of Subaru candidates.
"What crystallized it for me was what happened last fall or winter, when we pitched the Nikon account," he continued. "I looked around the room, and there were five of the best agencies: Ammirati & Puris, which has BMW; Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos, which has Infiniti; Della Femina (Isuzu); Levine, Huntley (Subaru), and TBWA, nothing. I thought, 'Man, we're the best agency in America that doesn't have a car account.' " And the winner was a car agency, Ammirati. Mr. Costello added, "With all the nice things that have happened to us over the last few years, the one thing we feel we're missing is the car accunt."
And while the current vehicle sales picture is bleak, automotive accounts remain desirable, Mr. Goldstein said, because, like other marketers, including airlines, restaurant chains, telecommunications outfits and computer makers, "advertising and promotion are critical to them to market their products, whether we're having boom times or we're in a recession."

Sharp Gains At Nordstrom And Dillard

BYLINE: By ISADORE BARMASH

 BODY:
Nordstrom Inc. and Dillard Department Stores, two of the nation's most widely followed retailers, reported sharp increases in quarterly income yesterday.
Considering the "continuing sluggish retail environment," both Nordstrom and Dillard "did quite well for the first quarter," said William N. Smith, retail analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company in New York. He said that Dillard, based in Little Rock, Ark., had primarily benefited from strong growth in same-store sales and had been able to improve sales in the stores it had acquired. He said Dillard had also been helped by not having stores in economically depressed areas like New England, the West and the Middle Atlantic States. 
 "Nordstrom had relatively weak sales results, especially in same stores, which were up in the quarter only six-tenths of 1 percent," Mr. Smith said. But the retail chain had achieved improved gross margins and expense leverage, he added.
"Nordstrom, too, is making a successful transition of appeal to more middle-income consumers, adding more moderately priced goods, without tarnishing its upscale image," Mr. Smith said.
Following are details of the companies' results:
 
Nordstrom
Nordstrom, which operates 64 fashion department stores, said its net jumped 95 percent, to $25.7 milion, or 31 cents a share, in the quarter ended April 30, from $13.2 million, or 16 cents a share, in the 1990 period. Sales rose 10 percent, to $610.6 million, from $555 million. Nordstrom, based in Seattle, operates in eight states and recently opened stores in Paramus, N.J., and Chicago.
"The company benefited from improving sales trends, better management of inventories and steps taken last year to reduce operating expenses," said John Goesling, senior vice president. "These results compare favorably with what we regarded as a disappointing performance during the previous year's first quarter."
Nordstrom, in addition to the release of its quarterly results, also announced that it had settled for $7.5 million both Federal and Washington state securities law class-action suits. Those actions accused the company and six of its officers of failing to disclose that Nordstrom might be liable for additional employee compensation arising from certain past employment practices.
The settlement, which is subject to court approval, calls for the payment to be made to shareholders who bought Nordstrom stock between Feb. 1, 1988, and March 8, 1990. Nordstrom said it had anticipated that most of the settlement would be covered by insurance.
The shareholder settlement followed an earlier settlement with employees who had complained that Nordstrom had failed to pay them for efforts outside their regular work hours, like telephone calls and personal deliveries to customers. Referring to the settlement, Mr. Goesling said that while arrangements with the insurance company were not yet resolved, any payment made by Nordstrom would not have an adverse effect on results for the year.
Nordstrom's stock advanced $2.75 yesterday, to $44, in over-the-counter trading.
 
Dillard
Dillard said that its net income in the quarter ended May 4 rose nearly 30 percent, to $38.1 million, or $1.03 a share, from $29.4 million, or 82 cents a share, in the 1990 quarter. Sales increased 19.3 percent, to $886 million from $742.4 million, while same-store sales -- those from stores opened at least a year -- rose 8.6 percent.
Dillard operates 186 traditional department stores in 18 states, mostly in the South, Southwest and Midwest. Selling primarily branded merchandise in the upper-middle price range, Dillard grew quickly by opening new stores and acquiring many stores from financially pressed retailers.
Dillard's stock rose $4.875 yesterday, closing at $123.25 on the Big Board.

HEADLINE: U.S. Output Up by 0.1% Last Month

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 13

 BODY:
Snapping a six-month decline, the nation's factories, mines and utilities raised production slightly in April as assemblies of trucks and automobiles rebounded, the Federal Reserve reported today.
The increase of one-tenth of 1 percent, while neither large nor unexpected, was seen as indicating that the economy was approaching its low point and that a recovery might be imminent. 
 "We take this number seriously," said James Annable, chief economist at the First National Bank of Chicago. "I think it's good evidence that this recession is indeed bottoming out."
 
Data Intently Scrutinized
 Industrial production data cover only about 25 percent of the economy but are intently scrutinized these days since this is the sector of greatest sensitivity to the business cycle.
But while analysts were encouraged by the first rise in industrial output since September, today's report also showed that output fell twice as much in March as initially estimated and that industry's operating rate, the utilization of capacity, slipped yet again, to 78.3 percent.
It was quite possible, they added, that more months of declining output might lie ahead before the economy was clearly seen to be on the mend. Industrial activity is a "coincident" indicator, typically not turning up before the economy at large but not lagging behind it, either.
 
Gains for Motor Vehicles
 Much of the improvement last month was concentrated in motor vehicles, where output has been held tightly in check during recent months as sales slumped. The April advance was 10.8 percent at a seasonally adjusted annual rate, 24.3 percent for trucks and 2.7 percent for cars.
Production of light trucks surged to an annual rate of 3.1 million from 2.5 million, accounting for the bulk of a 700,000 rate of overall gain for motor vehicles that carried the pace to 8.4 million units.
It appears that demand for light trucks has picked up this spring while car sales remain depressed.
 
Furniture and Textiles Up
 Excluding motor vehicles and parts, industrial production eased two-tenths of 1 percent but several non-automotive industries did post gains, including furniture and textiles. Output of lumber, another product closely tied to the recovering housing industry, has remained about unchanged since February after having dropped an average of almost 2 percent a month between July and February.
On the other hand, production continued to fall last month for primary metals, and weakness was still evident in chemicals and in transportation equipment other than motor vehicles. A drop of eight-tenths of 1 percent in primary metals was its fifth decline in a row.
Over all, factory output rose two-tenths of 1 percent with a rebound of six-tenths in durable goods -- those designed to last at least three years -- more than offsetting a two-tenths decline for nondurables that was paced by a fall in the output of consumer fuels.
 
Mines and Utilities Down
 American mines, meanwhile, produced 1.1 percent less in April than in March and utilities produced one-tenth of 1 percent less.
Production of both consumer goods and construction supplies rose four-tenths of 1 percent last month, construction supplies gaining after tumbling an average of 2.4 percent over the three preceding months. Output of business equipment, meanwhile, rose three-tenths of 1 percent, reversing a March decline of that amount.
The operating rate for manufacturing edged down one-tenth of a point, to 77.1 percent, its lowest level since August 1983, and 2.9 percent below the April 1990 level. The 78.3 percent rate for all industry was two-tenths of a point lower than in March and 2.5 percent lower than the level a year before.
At 105.1 percent of its 1987 average, industrial production last month was down 3.4 percent from April 1990.
April's one-tenth of 1 percent increase in output followed declines of six-tenths in March, eight-tenths in February and five-tenths in January. The March fall had initially been estimated at three-tenths.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Copper at a 15-Month Low As Industrial Need Slumps

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Copper futures sank to a 15-month low yesterday on the Commodity Exchange in New York as weak industrial demand and rising supplies pressed the metal's price toward $1 a pound.
Copper futures settled 1.95 cents to 3.1 cents lower, with the contract for delivery in May at $1.007 a pound, the lowest daily finish for spot copper since Feb. 8, 1990. 
 Copper has been sliding since late in the third quarter of 1990, when slowing industrial production translated into weakening demand. The metal is widely used in the construction, automobile and electronics industries.
"The direction of the market is being determined by the sluggish demand picture we're seeing," said William O'Neill, senior futures strategist with Merrill Lynch.
 
Heavy Japanese Selling
 Yesterday's drop began with heavy Japanese selling early in the session, said Fred Demler, the metals economist at Paine Webber Inc. He said those sales ignited speculative selling, which took the market down sharply.
Traders found little to cheer about in yesterday's Government report of a gain of one-tenth of a percent in industrial production last month after a six-month decline.
The improvement was too slight to offset weak copper demand at a time when industrial consumers of the metal normally were acquiring stocks for summer and fall, analysts said.
Grain and soybean futures ended narrowly mixed in a quiet session on the Chicago Board of Trade as traders awaited a Government update on spring planting progress.
In a weekly report released after the close, the Agriculture Department said corn planting in the 17 largest corn-growing states progressed rapidly last week but remained well behind the normal pace.
 
51% of Corn in Ground
 About 51 percent of the corn crop was planted as of Sunday, compared with a five-year average of 71 percent for that date.
The grain markets were also under pressure. the Agriculture Department said that a decision on whether to grant additional export credit guarantees to the Soviet Union would not be made until around May 24, when a team from the United States returns from studying the Soviet food distribution system.
Moscow has asked for $1.5 billion in United States food credits.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
The Dollar Is Mostly Down While Gold Prices Advance

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar ended lower yesterday against most major currencies except the Japanese yen, which was under pressure fromspeculation about declining interest rates in that country.
Gold prices headed higher after falling in Asia. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $358.60 a troy ounce, up $1.50 from late Friday. The Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for gold at $358 an ounce, $1.25 higher. 
 Currency dealers said technical factors were largely responsible for the dollar's movement. Most traders, they said, shrugged off the Government's latest economic report showing industrial production increased one-tenth of 1 percent in April against March's six-tenths of 1 percent decline.
The spotlight in foreign exchange centered on the yen.
"There is a perception that the Bank of Japan will lower interest rates," said Ronald H. Holzer, vice president and chief dealer for the Harris Trust and Company in Chicago.
Such speculation intensified after the Bank of Japan intervened by selling dollars for yen, traders said.
In Tokyo, where the global trading day begins, the dollar closed up 139.03 Japanese yen, from 138.58 yen Friday. It traded higher at 139.40 yen in London, and at 139.45 yen in New York, up from 138.70.
The dollar was weaker against the British pound compared with trading on Friday. Sterling bought $1.7320 in London, up from $1.7195, and $1.7385 in New York, up from $1.7245.
The dollar also fell against the German currency, dropping to 1.7140 marks in New York from late Friday's 1.7230.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's rates, included: 1.4412 Swiss francs, down from 1.4550; 5.8040 French francs, down from 5.8280; 1,272 Italian lire, down from 1,275, and 1.15005 Canadian dollars, down from 1.15135.
Meanwhile, gold gained in London to a late bid of $357 an ounce, from $356.80 Friday. In Zurich, gold rose to $357 an ounce from $356.50.
Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 23 cents an ounce to close at $357.44.
Silver prices declined.
On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current delivery settled at $3.989 a troy ounce, down from $4.024 late Friday. Silver fell in London to a late bid of $3.99 an ounce from $4.04.

HEADLINE: Historic Hotel Is S.& L. Victim

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: BRETTON WOODS, N.H., May 13

 BODY:
The hotel where the postwar international monetary system was born in the 1940's has fallen victim to the savings and loan debacle of the 1980's.
The Mount Washington, the last of five grand hotels that once graced this resort area, will be put on the auction block on June 26 by Federal banking regulators. 
 The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation acquired a majority stake in the 235-room hotel when it bailed out the Eliot Savings Bank of Boston.
The Mount Washington, an 89-year-old hotel that is on the National Register of Historical Places, was the site of the Bretton Woods conference, where economists and policy makers gathered in 1944 to hammer out rules for the global monetary system.
The meeting created the economic sister organizations of the United Nations: the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Prices of Treasury Issues Increase

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities rose in moderately active trading yesterday, with dealers reporting that some retail accounts were buying notes and bonds following Friday's big selloff.
Market participants said that most of the buying took place during overnight trading, with foreign accounts buying bonds when the yields on long-term bonds were around the 8.30 percent level reached near the close of business on Friday. 
 There were also some signs of life after market activity shifted to the United States, traders said.
"We are starting to grind back," said Joseph Liro, a senior vice president and money market economist at S. G. Warburg & Company. "But the problem is that since we started so much in the hole, I don't know where we will go if yields get back to 8.21 percent, which is where the new bonds were auctioned last week."
Indeed, analysts said that additional, sustained price improvement was unlikely until inventories of notes and bonds amassed by dealers during last week's quarterly refunding auctions were pared.
"While the long-term outlook for bonds remains bullish, we do not expect solid buying interest to emerge for several sessions, due to the burdensome supply conditions," analysts at MMS International, an economic information service company, said in their daily market commentary.
A report from the Federal Reserve showing that output at the nation's factories rose by one-tenth of a percentage point last month was largely in line with the expectations of analysts and evoked little response in the credit markets.
The gain, the first in six months, was even less than it appeared, however, because the Fed also said that industrial production declined by much more in March than initially reported.
In addition, market participants said, a decline in April in capacity utilization rates, a figure included in the Fed's report, should provide further help in squeezing out inflationary pressures.
"The market has a nice little pop to it, but it doesn't seem particularly inspired," said Mitchell Held, chief financial economist at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company.
Many economic statistics are expected to be released today, and that may help explain why market activity was not more intense yesterday. Among the reports scheduled are consumer price statistics and retail sales data for April.
Most economists expect that the inflation figures will show a modest upturn, and that retail sales sagged again last month.
At the Treasury's weekly bill auction, three-month bills were sold at an average discount rate of 5.50 percent, unchanged from last week's sale. Bids on the new six-month bills produced an average discount rate of 5.63 percent, up slightly from the average rate of 5.61 percent a week ago.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the new 8 1/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 98 1/2 late yesterday, up 18/32, to yield 8.26 percent, down from 8.31 percent late Friday.
Among Treasury note issues, the 8 percent 10-year notes were offered at 99 5/8, up 9/32, to yield 8.05 percent. And the 7 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 11/32, up 2/32, to yield 6.80 percent.
Activity in the investment-grade corporate bond market was slow yesterday, as market participants prepared for an expected offering today of $1.405 billion of new securities from Citicorp backed by credit card receipts. Price talk in advance of the offering put yields on the new five-year securities at between 95 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, and 99 basis points above the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7 5/8 percent five-year notes.
In the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds, prices of most issues rose by a quarter of a point in quiet trading, dealers said.
In the secondary market for tax-exempt securities, traders said that prices of most widely quoted municipal issues were unchanged to up an eighth of a point.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills:

HEADLINE: Gain in Square D Deal Seen After Slump Ends

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
The agreement by Groupe Schneider S.A. of France to buy the Square D Company for $2.23 billion is one of the largest consolidations in the electrical equipment industry. But that industry is facing some serious challenges because of lower demand in the construction market, which accounts for more than 60 percent of Square D's sales.
The combination of Square D, the North American market leader in low-voltage electrical distribution and industrial control products, and Schneider, with its vast size and financial resources, will result in a stronger competitor for other global giants like Siemens-Nixdorf of Germany, ABB of Sweden, Mitsubishi of Japan and General Electric. The acquisition will also create the world's largest maker of electrical control devices like circuit breakers, switchboards and transformers.
 
Square D Stock Soars
 In response to the agreement announced Sunday night, which calls for Schneider to pay $88 in cash for each Square D share, Square D's stock soared $6.375 yesterday, to $87.375, on the Big Board. 
 "Obviously, the industry has been affected by the economy," said James E. Peirce, an analyst with PNC Financial in Philadelphia. "With construction down, the industry is having some problems, and the outlook for this year is not too good," Mr. Peirce added. "But this will help both companies to be stronger competitors when the economy picks up again."
The combination will be particularly valuable, analysts said, because Schneider will be able to sell its products through Square D's big distribution system in the United States. The companies will have a combined budget of $450 million for research and development, Schneider said. Analysts said that figure would outpace others in the industry.
The combined company will have revenues of about $3 billion from electrical distribution systems, said Schneider, placing it above ABB, which has sales of about $2 billion in that field; Westinghouse, which has $1.6 billion; G.E., $1.5 billion, and Siemens, $1.2 billion.
 
Advantage After Recession
 The larger size will help the company after the recession, Square D officials said. "With the downturn in construction, our industry is deeply affected," said Robert P. Piorani, a Square D spokesman. "The industry is cyclical, and we are at a lower cyclical point. But with the recovery in sight, we expect to come out of this recession on a profitable and strong basis."
For years, Schneider has been trying to move into faster-growing markets overseas.
The industry is considered important because it provides the distribution and control of electrical energy from the point of generation to the outlet on the wall. Square D, based in the Chicago suburb of Palatine, Ill., gets about 80 percent of its profits from electrical distribution, which includes load and circuit breakers, safety switches and connectors. The rest comes from industrial control systems, which include power protection systems, infrared measurement products and automation products.
The size of the industry is difficult to determine, analysts say, because Square D is virtually alone as an independent producer of electrical distribution products. The other giants in the industry, like General Electric and Siemens, make a variety of products, from jet engines to machinery.
The deal follows the 1988 acquisition by Schneider of Telemecanique, another French electrical equipment maker.

HEADLINE: Cash-Strapped Cities Turn to Companies to Do What Government Once Did

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, May 13

 BODY:
Seventy years after Philadelphia helped launch a new era in American politics by having public workers provide most public services, many politicians here are saying the city's survival may depend on bringing that era to a quick close.
To help solve the city's fiscal crisis, say four of the eight politicians who are vying to be Philadelphia's next mayor, the city must put many costly public services, including trash collection and custodial services, out to competitive bid by private companies. 
 The assumption is that private companies are unhampered by union contracts, civil service systems, bloated work forces and other burdens that raise costs and are thus more efficient than governments in performing the same tasks.
A switch to private companies would normally be unthinkable in this overwhelmingly Democratic and highly unionized city. But public policy analysts say the time is ripe for radical change here and in many other cities, particularly older ones in the Northeast and Midwest.
An exception is New York, where there is a fiscal crisis but so little impetus toward shifting public services to private companies that Mayor David N. Dinkins has not even mentioned it in his recent statements on the city's financial problems.
Felix G. Rohatyn, chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, the state agency that monitors New York City's finances. favors contracting out more services and attributed the lack of action to political inertia.
 
Move to Shed Services
 Elsewhere, the trend is clear. "Since the beginning of the 1980's the prevailing political philosophy has been that governments should shed what services they can," said Dr. Anita A. Summers, professor of public policy and management at the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania.
The buzzword here, in both Democratic and Republican circles, is privatization. The term, popularized by the Reagan Administration, refers to a process of stripping government to the bones: While public officials continue to regulate and administer the city government, private companies bid to provide public services.
Such arrangements have become relatively common around the nation, though much less so in large older cities like Philadelphia.
Many cities have experimented with privatization, according to the Mercer Group, a management consultant in Atlanta that advises cities on ways to contract out services. A survey last year of 82 municipalities in 34 states chosen to represent cities of different sizes, regions and political organizations found that virtually all had contracted out at least three services.
The savings that result from contracting out services are hard to measure, but numerous studies put the savings at a 10 percent to 40 percent reduction in costs, with the greatest savings coming from contracting out labor-intensive services. Savings also vary depending on how bloated a city's work force is and how out of line city compensation is with the marketplace. But most estimates do not include hidden costs like writing and bidding contracts, monitoring contractors, cost-overruns and employee severance.
State governments have been generally less experimental than local governments, but many states have started to hire private companies to manage prisons, roads, parks, commuter railways and hospitals. Cities in the South and West, where unions are weaker and where growing populations have strained public services, have been the most active in contracting out public services.
Los Angeles County recently contracted out the management of five small airports, and the Los Angeles City Council last month discussed selling the Los Angeles International Airport. Fort Worth is turning the operation of its zoo over to a not-for-profit organization that will seek charitable donations to cover annual deficits.
Chicago is contracting out a string of services and, in some cases, turning money losers like vehicle towing into small profit centers. Lansing, Mich., is looking for companies or not-for-profit organizations to take over the city's ambulance service, cemetery and recreation programs.
And among Northeastern cities, Newark has taken the lead by contracting out a dozen functions, including a third of the city's trash collections. "The hardest part of it is laying off men and women who live in the community," said Mayor Sharpe James.
 
Reversal in Phoenix
 In 1978, Phoenix set up a competitive system in which private contractors bid against the city for trash collection. For several years, the department was underbid and lost contracts to serve half the city. But by 1987, the department had won back all the contracts.
"Competition forces you to improve productivity, develop teamwork and raise morale," said Ron W. Jensen, director of the department. A city audit estimated that competition had saved the city $20 million in the last decade.
Despite the boom in privatization, experts say it is easy to do wrong, because public officials are just learning to write these novel contracts. In March, for example, Los Angeles County officials canceled a five-year contract to maintain city vehicles because of cost overruns.
Labor leaders, facing the prospects of layoffs, say that contracting with private companies to run public services is merely a way for politicians to hide their own management failures. "Philadelphia is not in a mess just because of union work rules," said Linda M. Lampkin, director of research for the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.
 
Savings Can Be Small
 Even where there are considerable savings in some departments, they can be relatively small compared to the overall budgets of many cities. And Paul Starr, a sociologist at Princeton University, said that in many privatization plans the savings are largely a result of private companies' paying low wages and providing minimal health benefits.
Apart from the individual hardship, he said, the net social result was that one branch of government saved money while social welfare agencies and public health agencies spent more because more city employees were out of work.
Ray F. Ybarra, business manager of the Phoenix sanitation workers' union, said the private contractors were hardly free of problems and added: "The city is wasting money going through the bidding process. It's a myth that competition keeps you on your toes."
In Philadelphia, there are discussions about selling the city-owned gas and water utilities, Veterans Stadium, parking garages and the Philadelphia International Airport, which, like nearly all other airports that receive Federal subsidies, is operated as a not-for-profit entity. But laws, politics and opposition from companies that benefit from current arrangements make it unlikely that major city-owned assets would be sold or leased any time soon.
But the city's labor contracts, which prohibit layoffs, expire next year, and a new mayor could consider contracting out things like trash collection, custodial services, vehicle repairs and building maintenance, said Dianne E. Reed, director of the Pennsylvania Economy League, a not-for-profit research organization.
She said a conservative estimate of savings produced by these contracts was $20 million to $30 million a year; other experts in privatization say the savings would be much higher. The savings would only dent the city's deficit, which is more than $230 million on this year's $2.1 billion budget, but would be "psychologically significant," she said.
Many of the mayoral candidates who are lining up for the May 21 primary have prescribed more state aid and contracting out services as the most powerful remedies for Philadelphia's financial ills. Mayor W. Wilson Goode is prevented by law from running for a third consecutive term.
"Contracting out public services can produce significant savings and restore credibility to the city in Harrisburg and up on Wall Street," said Edward G. Rendell, a former Philadelphia District Attorney and a Democratic candidate for mayor.
The candidates with backing from city unions oppose contracting out services.
Former Mayor Frank L. Rizzo, who is running as a Republican, is one of the staunch opponents to privatization. "I'm pro union, I've been that way all my life," he said at a recent candidates forum the issue.
James S. White, a Democrat and former managing director of the city who just dropped out of the race, said: "We've already privatized the health care in prisons, solid waste disposal, the golf courses, the trolley service in Fairmount Park, certain custodial services in certain buildings and all road resurfacing."
But in New York, Mr. Rohatyn said: "When you begin to talk to politicians about privatization, they look at you with blank stares because they know that kind of process takes years here." He recalled that in the midst of the city's mid-1970's fiscal crisis, the assistance corporation proposed contracting out trash collection but that the proposal died after running "into a brick wall of opposition," mostly from unions and private trash haulers.
Philadelphia's fiscal crisis has turned up the volume in the debate over contracting out services, but it remains to be seen whether a new Mayor could persuade the City Council to lay off city workers. Three years ago, when the city first invited competitive bids for collecting trash, the council rejected a contract that its advocates said would have saved the city $40 million in the first year. It chose to keep sanitation workers on the job and contract out only waste disposal.
To some local history buffs, the debate echoes one that took place more than 70 years ago, when city ordinances required officials to contract out all services. Corruption was rampant. In 1919, Philadelphia repealed those ordinances and developed professionally managed service agencies.
Frederick L. Voight is executive secretary of the Committee of Seventy, a not-for-profit group founded in 1904 after the muckraker Lincoln Steffens wrote that Philadephia was "corrupt and contented."
"We have to be very careful," Mr. Voight said, "about going private in a way that we don't repeat the mistakes of the past under the guise of doing something new and different."

HEADLINE: Daily News Is Rebuilding Circulation But Is Still Below Level Before Strike

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
Eight weeks after the British publisher Robert Maxwell took over The Daily News and ended a bitter five-month strike, the New York newspaper has overcome initial difficulties in production and distribution and has begun to rebuild its circulation.
But whether The News will approach the daily circulation of almost 1.1 million that it had before the strike began last October, when it was the nation's largest daily tabloid, is still in doubt. Newspaper investment analysts and newspaper executives say it will be months before the long-term prospects of The News become more clear. 
 Executives of The News say about 800,000 copies a day are now being sold. The News claimed a circulation of 600,000 during the strike, but labor leaders and executives at other papers said then that perhaps half that many papers were being bought each day.
Some newspaper investment analysts and newspaper executives said that, based on reports from newspaper dealers and distributors, they thought the daily circulation of The News was now about 700,000. They were uncertain how many copies were now being sold on Sunday, a critical day in the newspaper business because as much as half of the advertising revenue for an entire week comes from the Sunday edition. Several newspaper executives said they thought 700,000 to 800,000 copies of The News were being sold on Sundays. Officials of The News did not disclose the current Sunday circulation.
 
Chief Beneficiary
 New York Newsday appears to be the chief beneficiary of the strike at The News and its aftermath. The New York edition of the Long Island paper sold about 225,000 copies a day before October and reached a daily peak of 365,000 during the strike. Its circulation is now slightly less than 300,000 on weekdays, said Chiara Coletti, a Newsday spokeswoman.
New York Newsday is selling 375,000 copies on Sunday, more than double its Sunday circulation of 155,000 before the strike, Ms. Coletti said. On Long Island, Newsday has a daily circulation of about 500,000 and a Sunday circulation of about 560,000, she said.
The New York Post, which reached a peak of more than 1 million in February, is now down to about 550,000 copies a day, a spokesman for The Post, Gary Lewi, said. Several executives at other newspapers did not challenge The Post and Newsday figures.
The major question for all three New York tabloids -- The News, The Post and Newsday -- is how thoroughly The News can rebuild its circulation, many executives and investment analysts said. If The News can reach daily sales of 800,000 to 900,000, they said, it would re-establish its dominance among the tabloids, and significantly increased advertising would likely follow.
 
Buying Patterns
 "I was surprised that the circulation did not come back faster," said John Reidy, a newspaper investment analyst at Smith Barney. "I had thought that the circulation would bounce back to about a million fairly quickly."
Mr. Reidy said the next few months could be crucial for The News. He said it would have to attract more readers before people go on summer vacations. "Buying patterns get established," he said. "If you didn't get them back by the end of June and they're going to go off on a trip or to the shore, are you going to get them back in September?"
Many of The News's traditional advertisers, including Macy's and Alexander's, have been running ads in recent weeks. But its comeback effort is complicated by the recession, with nearly all advertisers cutting back.
 
Introductory Rates
 "They have a lot of loyal advertisers, but their deals are all over the place," said a newspaper executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "They are offering some nice introductory rates. You've got to do that so you don't look like you're out of business. They've got to prove their circulation, which will then drive their advertising."
The next semiannual audit of newspapers' circulation will not be reported until the end of September, so until then The News will have to win the confidence of advertisers without independent verification of its circulation.
Executives of The News said they were confident that they could do so. "Mr. Maxwell has guaranteed our advertisers a daily circulation of 800,000 and a Sunday circulation of 1 million for the six months ending with the A.B.C. audit of Sept. 30," said John G. Campi, the paper's vice president of promotion and public relations, referring to the Audit Bureau of Circulation. "Our initial checks suggest that we're right on target."
In the initial weeks after Mr. Maxwell took over The Daily News from the Tribune Company of Chicago on March 21, The News had significant problems with printing and distribution, and the paper was slow to return to many newsstands.
Hundreds of union drivers and pressmen were laid off as a result of the settlement between Mr. Maxwell and the paper's unions, and it took time to reconfigure staffing levels for the reduced work force.
Some union officials said Mr. Maxwell's refusal to pay overtime made it difficult to print the required number of papers and impossible for some drivers to complete their deliveries.
Donald A. Nizen, a former circulation executive at The New York Post and The New York Times, was hired by Mr. Maxwell last month to help straighten out the distribution system. Mr. Nizen said drivers have now selected their new routes and have become familiar with them. In late March and early April, he said, drivers had different routes each night.
He said some overtime has been restored for longer routes. "You can't get from Brooklyn to Montauk on straight time," he said. All overtime must still be approved by Mr. Maxwell.
 
Still the Publisher
 The publisher of The News, James Hoge, has been away while many of these matters have been resolved. In mid-April, officials at the paper said Mr. Hoge had gone on a six-week vacation. That led to speculation by the staff that Mr. Hoge, who had run the newspaper before Mr. Maxwell took over, would not return.
Mr. Campi reiterated yesterday that Mr. Hoge was still the publisher. Last week, Mr. Hoge was said to have been an unsuccessful candidate for chief executive of the American Newspaper Publishers Association.
Under the sale agreement, the Tribune Company would pay severance to about 60 senior executives if Mr. Maxwell should dismiss them during the first 90 days after the sale, an executive involved in the sale said. The executives would get two weeks' pay for every year of service at The News, up to a year's pay. For 10 days after the 90-day period, they could leave voluntarily and still receive the severance.
Now that the paper's post-strike problems have been worked out, The News has begun restoring pre-strike features, like zoned editions in some boroughs and more sections on Sunday, Mr. Nizen said.
One News employee said executives were studying whether to bring back a late-afternoon edition published only during the strike.
But some investment analysts said it would be months before the prospects for The News could be evaluated.
"All the problems that The Daily News had before the strike are still there," said John Morton, a newspaper analyst at Lynch, Jones & Ryan in Washington. "It is a paper that has had profound market problems for a long time. And Maxwell has not come up with a magic formula so far."

HEADLINE: Panel Urges Wider State-City Fiscal Ties

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
New York City and State suffer deep and inseparable fiscal problems that will not be solved by an economic recovery, and should agree on a multiyear plan to shift tax burdens from the city to the state, shrink their work forces and improve management, a major civic group said yesterday.
The report by the Citizens Budget Commission puts it at least partly at odds with Mayor David N. Dinkins, who endorses shifting some of the city's burdens to the state and streamlining government but contends that the city's problems are mostly the result of a cyclical recession that will pass. 
 The commission, a nonprofit watchdog group financed by businesses and for more than half a century a leading Cassandra on local fiscal issues, said the city and the state could face combined deficits totaling $30 billion over the next four years and must begin phasing in fundamental but politically difficult changes.
In making the recommendations, the budget commission, whose chairman is Richard Ravitch, the former mayoral candidate who was chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, sums up and expands on a chorus of warnings that New York's problems are so deep and likely to persist as to require a rethinking of state and local governments' mission.
"I think this is an opportunity to deal with this on a long-term basis," he said. "People need certainty and reasonable predictability to make economic decisions. And it's very damaging to have us lurch from crisis to crisis."
 
Sharing the Costs
 Many of the changes recommended by the commission have been batted around unsuccessfully for years. They include the state's assuming a greater share of the cost of Medicaid and welfare payments, better management of health care for the poor and reshaping employee health benefits, a smaller, more efficient work force in which government could share savings from increased productivity with workers, and higher state income and gasoline taxes to help pay Medicaid and welfare costs and allow reductions in local taxes.
Only in exchange for such major changes, the group's leaders said, should the city and state move to borrow their way out of their current troubles through various proposals now under review to stretch out the problem by refinancing bonds, for example.
The commission's president, Raymond D. Horton, said: "What we're sort of looking for is some sort of compact with all the players. What I'm really afraid of now is that we're getting awfully close to treating this problem very much like we treated the 1975 crisis as just a financing problem."
Mayor Dinkins and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo have said they hope the Municipal Assistance Corporation, which was set up to borrow money on the city's behalf in the 1970's, could now help it with several hundred million dollars from bond refinancings in the coming year.
Yesterday, in a WNYC radio interview, Mr. Cuomo said the assistance corporation might be able to provide more than $1 billion over the next several years if it could do so without damaging its credit ratings. The corporation's chairman, Felix G. Rohatyn, says he could only provide such help on those conditions and as part of a comprehensive plan.
The budget commission, too, has resisted the idea of borrowing to help close the deficit, and its report seemed aimed at buttressing Mr. Rohatyn's views in the face of heavy political pressure to use the money for this.
Of the study, Mr. Cuomo said in Albany: "We're trying to deal with imminent catastrophe in New York City between now and May 25. The Citizens Budget Commission's ideas for the future may be worthwhile. For the moment the important question is how to get the Legislature to produce a budget within the next 10 days or so, and that's what I'm concentrating on."
A spokesman for Mr. Dinkins, Eli Attie, said, "Obviously we're very pleased that the Citizens Budget Commission has embraced a number of proposals we have already made," like having the state bear a bigger share of Medicaid costs. "We hope the C.B.C. will use whatever authority it has to help achieve these goals. At the same time, it's important to recognize that achieving these kinds of reforms isn't as easy as issuing a report or snapping your fingers."
"I think there is no question," Mr. Rohatyn said, "that ultimately there has to be a city-state restructuring of functions and financing."
"This obviously can't be done overnight," he added, "and I think the only way to do it will be for some legislatively created type of commission to make recommendations to the Legislature and to have it voted up or down."

HEADLINE: Mulroney Outlines New Unity Strategy

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: OTTAWA, May 13

 BODY:
Amid indications that Quebec may resolve differences with the rest of Canada without breaking away, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney outlined a strategy of broad public consultation today as the key to national unity.
In his first major address to the nation since the collapse of an effort for constitutional change in June, the embattled Progressive Conservative leader, who is far down in the polls, promised economic and social changes as the constitutional issues are worked on. 
 "Prosperity is enhanced by a united country," Mr. Mulroney declared. "But disunity in the face of global economic challenge invites decline."
His remarks, which signal the path the Government will take in elections that have to be called in two years, were delivered in the Senate of Parliament in the Speech From the Throne, a rough equivalent of the American State of the Union Message. Canada recognizes Queen Elizabeth II as its formal head of state.
 
Truckers and Other Protesters
 The text of the speech, prepared by Mr. Mulroney, was read by the Queen's representative, Governor General Ramon J. Hnatyshyn, in a traditional ceremony in the Parliament Building. On the lawns, demonstrators carried placards referring to "brain-dead Tories" and calling for the impeachment of Mr. Mulroney. Truckers protested high fuel and insurance costs.
The speech kicking off the third session of the 34th Parliament in 124 years of nationhood was intended to lift morale -- and Tory political hopes -- at a time when Canada is not only going through a constitutional crisis, but also a recession that is already deeper and longer than the one in the United States.
Although there have been signs that the recession may have bottomed out here, unemployment is still at 10.2 percent of the work force, about 4 points higher than in the United States, and home-mortgage interest rates have not fallen under 10 percent.
Mr. Mulroney, whose seven years in power have been dominated by efforts to win free trade with the United States, and now Mexico, and fend off Quebec separatists, is hoping to capitalize on the more subdued feelings about independence in Quebec. Polls show the number of voters supporting sovereignty has sharply dropped since last year, apparently reflecting effects of the recession and warnings of Quebec business leaders that more belt-tightening would follow independence.
Although the Quebec legislature is expected this week to outline plans for a separatism referendum by the end of next year, Premier Robert Bourassa has said he may delay the vote if the other nine provinces are close to making commitments on revising the Federal system.
 
New Ideas for Changes
 Against this backdrop, Mr. Mulroney sketched out a more broadly based process for changes to replace the failed Meech Lake Accord of June. That proposal would have enshrined Quebec's status as a "distinct society." The effort failed to carry two provinces, Newfoundland and Manitoba.
Mr. Mulroney said his Government would formulate plans to change Federal and provincial powers by September and refer the proposals to a joint parliamentary committee that would consult Canadians at all levels of life. The committee is to report in five months, and the Government would propose a plan for "a renewed Canada for consideration by the people of Canada."
Although the speech did not spell it out, officials said the Prime Minister was leaving the door open to a referendum or a constituent assembly for final votes on the proposals. He said he would follow the principles that Quebec's "unique character must be affirmed" and that "particular interests of the west, the Atlantic provinces, Ontario, the north and aboriginal Canadians must be recognized as well."
Mr. Mulroney said the two-and-a-half-year-old free-trade agreement with the United States, which is seen by opposition members as costing jobs, had "helped to secure the Canadian economy in difficult times." For the first time in 16 years, he noted, Canada is attracting more job-creating direct investment than had been going abroad.

HEADLINE: Stock Prices Edge Upward on a Quiet Day

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
Stocks edged higher yesterday in quiet trading as investors tried to figure out where the economy was heading.
The Dow Jones industrial index of 30 blue chips tacked on 4.25 points to close at 2,924.42. 
 Trading on the New York Stock Exchange slumped from more than 170 million shares on Friday to 129.6 million shares, the slowest in a week.
Birinyi Associates, which tracks program trading, said five big waves of computer-driven selling cut close to 23 points off the Dow throughout the day. Selling was particularly heavy early in the day and again between 1 P.M. and 2 P.M.
Asked why the Dow was not doing better, Allen Sinai, chief economist for the Boston Company, said: "The market's overvalued. The economy has to recover soon and by a lot to justify these prices."
The market, he argued, "is way ahead of itself and has discounted good earnings long before we're likely to see them."
Alan M. Newman, technical market analyst for H. D. Brous & Company, in Great Neck, L.I., said he thought the S.&P. 500, the Value Line index and the New York Stock Exchange's composite index would "continue to outperform" the Dow "because of the way the Dow's constructed."
"When I look at the charts of the smaller stocks," he said, "I see much more potential than I see in the Dow stocks. The smaller stocks overwhelmingly have been under selling pressure for years, and the market is telling us the economy will recover eventually -- although that could still be a year away -- and that these small companies will remain attractive."
As he explained it, "The problem with the Dow is that it's 30 stocks; all you've gotta do is throw in a couple of rotten apples and you really spoil the performance compared to the other indexes."
Union Carbide, Sears Roebuck and American Express, he maintained, "have basically gone nowhere in a long time."
And as for what he called "the worst reason why the Dow can underperform in the near future," he mentioned Merck and Disney, two of the most highly regarded investment stocks.
"God forbid these stocks split," Mr. Newman said. "Their impact will be severely reduced."
He noted that Merck ended yesterday up 1/8 at 118 1/2 and that Disney, which just joined the Dow index a week ago, ended ahead 5/8 at 121 1/2.
"The best-performing Dow stocks are generally the highest-priced ones," he said, "and the highest-priced ones are generally the ones that split."
Of course, companies like to split their stock so that more people can afford to buy it. Moreover, stocks that split often continue to rise.
Mr. Sinai noted that while the Fed "is a friend to the stock market," it was not easing interest rates any more right now -- "and that's negative."
Asked why the Fed would not ease for the present, he replied, "It's expecting a recovery."
He said Wall Street would be watching for clues in such forward-looking figures as retail sales, expected today, and housing starts, due on Thursday.
Technology stocks, often viewed as a market leader, were fairly strong yesterday. I.B.M. rose 2 1/2, to 105 7/8; Digital Equipment 1 7/8, to 67 7/8; Apple Computer 1 1/2, to 52 3/4, and Motorola 1 5/8, to 65 3/8.
Dillard rose 4 7/8, to 123 1/4, and Nordstrom 2 3/4, to 44, after both store chains reported higher-than-expected profits.
Square D jumped 6 3/8, to 87 3/8, after the electrical equipment producer accepted $88 a share from Schneider of France when the Justice Department said it would not block the deal on antitrust grounds.

HEADLINE: Census Finds Households Are Growing In New York

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN

 BODY:
After declining steadily for most of this century, the average number of people living in a household in New York City began to rise again in the last decade, according to an analysis of 1990 census data by New York City planners.
The reversal of the longstanding trend toward smaller households appeared to signal a return to an old phenomenon for a new generation in this city of immigrants -- one in which families with many children and older members had to live together. 
 Richard L. Schaffer, the Director of City Planning, said yesterday that the average size of New York households increased to 2.54 people in 1990 from 2.49 in 1980. Despite the citywide increase, Manhattan -- with fewer than two people in each living unit -- retained its distinction as the county with the smallest household size in the nation.
"This modest increase in household size reflects recent changes in the composition of our population," Mr. Schaffer said of the citywide figures. "For example, we have many new immigrant groups with extended families and multigenerational households."
 
Living With Relatives
 And in a city that gained at least 250,000 people in the 1980's, and perhaps many more if census figures are adjusted upward, a declining economy and a shortage of affordable housing may also have contributed to the rise in the average household size, Mr. Schaffer said. Both factors make it harder for immigrants and young people to establish their own households.
While experts say hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers are living with relatives or friends in overcrowded apartments, Evelyn Mann, the Planning Department's population division director, cautioned against interpreting the figures as confirmation that families are doubled up.
"It doesn't necessarily mean that people are being squeezed in," she said. "It only means that more housing in certain areas of the city is being used at their designed levels. I don't think the census actually counted many people who were doubled up. If such arrangements were illegal, it would not have been reported."
Average household size is figured by dividing the number of people in households in a given area by the number of occupied units in that area. New York City contends that both the population and the housing count were seriously flawed in the 1990 census, partly because residents in illegally overcrowded housing were not reported.
If people were undercounted, Mr. Schaffer noted, the average number of people in New York households might well be higher than 2.54.
In any case, he said, the 1990 census showed a reversal in trends toward smaller households that had been noted since 1900.
The average size of New York households at the turn of the century -- in an era of heavy immigration by ethnic groups that tended to have many children and lived in large, multigenerational families -- was 4.51 people, according to figures supplied by the Planning Department.
But as increasing prosperity and a growing housing stock in New York allowed for more privacy and greater choice in living arrangements, the extended families broke up, young people increasingly established their own homes. Household size declined to 3.89 people in 1930, to 3.2 in 1950 and to 2.74 in 1970.
 
Immigrant Pattern Cited
 Mrs. Mann said the 1990 census figures for average household size suggested a return in some neighborhoods "to the family structure at the turn of the century" by new immigrants who had many children and lived in multigenerational households.
For example, she said, an apartment in Flatbush that once was the home of a large extended immigrant family was occupied down through the decades by fewer people as the family prospered and children moved out, until finally the apartment was occupied by a lone widowed grandmother.
When that woman dies or goes to a nursing home, the apartment again becomes occupied by a new large extended immigrant family. This has the effect of raising the size of the household and using the housing stock more efficiently, Mrs. Mann said.
"It's turning back the clock in some neighborhoods," she said of the reversal of the long decline in household size.
Moreover economic hard times and an inadequate stock of affordable housing have prompted many young people to remain longer at home with their parents. People who are doubled up with relatives or friends have also postponed establishing their own households.
Mr. Schaffer said that while all five boroughs gained population in the 1990 census, the Bronx and Brooklyn experienced declines in housing units and occupied housing units. In the Bronx, average household size rose from 2.66 to 2.74, while Brooklyn's increased from 2.66 to 2.73.
Thus, he said "more people lived in fewer housing units in these two boroughs than in the past."
Manhattan and Queens gained in total and occupied housing units and the number of people in each household. Manhattan's increase, to 1.99 people from 1.92 in each household, did not jeopardize its national standing as the county with the lowest average household size. Queens showed an increase from 2.62 to 2.67 over the decade.
Staten Island had the highest percentage increase among the boroughs in both housing units and people in each household, but nonetheless it experienced a decrease in average household size from 2.99 to 2.85.

HEADLINE: Nursing Homes Drain Connecticut Budget

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: FAIRFIELD, Conn., May 8

 BODY:
Grete Struch, blind but barely slowed down, marches the hallways at the Jewish Home for the Elderly with a Braille copy of a Danielle Steel novel under her arm and a fistful of raffle tickets to sell. She also has the Sweetheart's Ball coming up, plus an afternoon sing-along, a cocktail party, and the next crafts sale.
Her ebullience shatters the stereotype of nursing homes as bleak and sterile warehouses. The cultivated grounds here, the hallways lined with stained glass, the buoyant good humor of the patients and the constant activities attest to the high level of care. 
 And that is the problem. Connecticut spends about 17 cents out of every general fund tax dollar, or about $1.2 billion, on medical assistance, with a good part of that going to nursing-home care in places just like this one. With a fiscal crisis and an aging population bearing down from two sides, the Medicaid budget, intended to help the poor, has emerged as a middle-class entitlement program that state officials say can no longer be maintained in the style to which it has become accustomed.
The Jewish Home, for example, charges $194 a day for skilled full-time nursing care, or $70,810 a year. Of its 240 patients needing that level of care, 83 percent are legally destitute and have most of their bills paid by Medicaid, the Federal and state reimbursement program. Even at the reduced Medicaid rate of $163 a day, and with patients contributing Social Security payments and other income, a year here can still cost taxpayers $50,000 or more per patient, state officials say.
When times were good and Medicaid patients were rare, few questioned the priorities of a system that created expensive nursing centers like the Jewish Home, with its 12-member recreation staff, music-therapy sessions and entertainment programs to stimulate the minds of its residents.
It is formal state policy, for example, that no one should have to drive more than 10 miles to visit relatives in a nursing home, an almost unheard-of courtesy that national health experts say has led to clusters of small homes, each costing far more per bed to operate than one large home.
Even at the median statewide rate of $109 a day, Connecticut nursing-home care is the fourth most expensive in the nation, after Alaska, Hawaii and New York.
But in the harsher light of recession and budget crisis, state officials have declared war on a system they say is too costly to withstand Connecticut's newly straitened economic circumstances. Armed with con sultants' studies and anecdotes about patients' limousine rides to hospitals at state expense, they have proposed an overhaul that would separate for the first time those costs that are strictly related to medical care. So-called nonessential care would be sharply restricted.
Total Medicaid expenditures would be reduced by about $78 million in the year beginning July 1, with the bulk of the immediate cuts -- and the even more restrictive growth limits set for futures years -- aimed at pushing the most expensive homes down toward the median.
State welfare officials have also attacked their clients, the patients, arguing that growing numbers of middle-class people who transfer all their assets to their children are unfairly expropriating Medicaid, which was intended for the poor.
These newly minted poor, having given away their wealth, enter the nursing-home system at state expense, fueling part of the sharp increase in Medicaid cases that began in the mid-1980's. Another factor is that the highest Medicaid enrollment rates are also found in the most expensive homes.
"The taxpayer has been there with the checkbook, with no limits," said Lorraine M. Aronson, the deputy secretary at the Office of Policy and Management. "Now we have to say, 'what is care?' " she added. "What do we believe is a reasonable contribution on the part of the taxpayer?"
 
Highest in the Nation
 Nursing home operators and advocates for the elderly blame the state for creating the spiral. Connecticut is one of only a handful of states that regulate private-pay nursing home rates, and those regulated prices are the highest in the nation, reaching a peak of nearly $200 a day at the most costly centers.
State laws also mandate that patients receive exactly the same care regardless of how their bills are paid, a provision that nursing home operators say removes any incentive to pay one's own way. Why give up a lifetime of savings if it makes no difference in care?
They also attack the system as being riddled with inefficiencies that have nothing to do with care. Medicaid rules require, for example, the use of $5,000 customized wheelchairs for certain patients, and has refused to reimburse the modification of a standard wheelchair at about half the cost, according to administrators of St. Joseph's Manor, a nursing home in Trumbull.
On a moral landscape where the painful issues of aging bump up hard against the realities of public finance and nursing-home profits, all sides ask the same question: can a state with growing numbers of elderly, a clouded economic future, and festering problems of poverty and infant mortality cut back on spending for the elderly without betraying its own vision?
 
Immediate Layoffs
 "For years they've said, 'we don't care what you spend, we want everybody to get a Cadillac level of care,' " said Louis Halpryn, executive vice president of the Connecticut Association of Health Care Facilities, a trade group that represents most nursing homes. "They can't change all that in one year -- it's Draconian," he added.
"All the things that soothe the soul -- goodbye," said Rebecca Baker, the Jewish Home's director of community relations and special projects. "These are the things that make life worth living."
At the Jewish Home, a nonprofit center, administrators say the reimbursement overhaul plan could result in immediate layoffs for 10 percent of the 550 employees if the proposal is approved by the State Legislature. Statewide, nursing home lobbyists say that between 1,200 to 1,500 jobs could be lost.
At the backdrop of the debate are numbers that cannot be changed by anyone: Connecticut's population is aging, and the elderly of today are living longer. That portends a future with more nursing-home patients who will require more and more expensive care as they live on into their 90's.
In the 1980's, people aged 85 and over made up the single fastest growing segment of the state's population, up 31.5 percent, according to figures from the Federal Bureau of the Census. The percent of the population aged 65 or over rose to 13.6 percent in 1990 from 11.7 percent in 1980.
Other numbers are so foggy as to be almost meaningless. The overhaul package, for example, would impose a three-year moratorium on the approval of any new nursing-home beds on the theory that the state has a surplus of beds and that any bed, once created, will be filled whether it is really needed or not. Yet many homes also have waiting lists. The Jewish Home has more than 300 people waiting for an available space.
And some of the most desirable homes already have the upper hand. One woman who insisted that her name not be used said she looked at eight nursing homes for her 82-year-old mother, and three of the homes wanted illegal deposits to guarantee admission. One insisted that all of the patient's assets be turned over to the home, to be "spent down" to the point at which Medicaid could take over.
The woman said she finally paid a $4,000 deposit, and is still on a waiting list to get into the home she really wanted.

HEADLINE: Health Insurance Gaps Laid to Racial Bias

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 13

 BODY:
The editor of a medical journal said today that longstanding racial discrimination was one reason black and Hispanic people were slipping through ever-widening cracks of the nation's health care system.
In an editorial in The Journal of the American Medical Association this week, the editor, Dr. George Lundberg, said it was no coincidence that the United States and South Africa were the only developed countries that lack a national health policy insuring access to basic care for all. 
 The United States and South Africa "also are the only two countries that have within their borders substantial numbers of under-served people who are different ethnically from the controlling group," Dr. Lundberg said.
Inequity in access to health care in the United States, he said, is due in part to "longstanding, systematic, institutionalized racial discrimination."
Such characterizations of American health care have been expressed before, but Dr. Lundberg's statement was considered remarkable for a medical association official. Dr. Lundberg is editor in chief of all the association's publications.
 
Disparity in Medical Care
 Black and Hispanic people have higher rates of unemployment than whites, and more often have low-level jobs. So, Dr. Lundberg said, they have less employment-related health insurance and are less likely to receive medical care.
And the public sector has not filled the gaps, he said, adding that Medicaid coverage for the poor is often harder to get in states that have large populations of blacks.
Nationwide, an estimated 31 million to 37 million Americans lack any health insurance, and millions of others who are insured lack adequate coverage. The rising number of uninsured Americans and the steeply rising costs of health care have recently emerged as a major preoccupation of government, business and many citizens. But there is little consensus on solutions.
"An aura of inevitability is upon us," Dr. Lundberg said in his editorial. "It is no longer acceptable morally, ethically or economically for so many of our people to be medically uninsured or seriously underinsured."
 
A.M.A.'s Call for Reform

The A.M.A. devoted the entire issue of its journal this week to proposals for restructuring the nation's health care system. From among 80 individuals and groups that answered the association's call last year for reform proposals, editors selected 13 for publication in the journal.
The proposals fall into four broad categories. Some, put forth by the A.M.A. and other groups, would expand access to all by requiring employers to provide health insurance for all full-time workers and their families. Government would insure nonworkers and the poor. A second group of proposals, variants on the first, would require employers either to provide health insurance or pay a tax, and the Government would use the tax proceeds to help cover uninsured workers.
A third approach, put forth by market-oriented conservatives, would provide income-related tax credits for individuals and families to help them buy insurance directly, while eliminating current tax incentives that promote job-based insurance.
A fourth approach would establish a single, comprehensive public insurance program without co-payments or deductibles. It would allow everyone to choose his or her own provider and would be financed with health care taxes. The higher taxes required to finance national insurance would be offset in large part by the elimination of employer payments for health insurance.

HEADLINE: Continental's New Face Is Red

 BODY:
Some women like to wear the kind of makeup that shouts. Some women like to wear the kind of makeup that whispers. And some women like to wear no makeup at all. For very few of them does not using cosmetics mean the difference between a job and the unemployment line. Teresa Fischette is one of those few.
Is Teresa Fischette a performer, who must be visible from the balcony? No. Is she a sales representative for Elizabeth Arden? No. 
 Teresa Fischette is, or was until last week, a ticket-counter agent at Boston's Logan International Airport for Continental Airlines. The airline, now operating under the supervision of a bankruptcy court, wants a new image. Female ground workers, the airline says, must wear makeup. Told, in other words, that she had to get a new face, Ms. Fischette demurred -- and was fired.
Since then she has been offered a job with no customer contact, thereby sparing potential passengers a glimpse of a naked female face. She has refused; the Massachusetts Civil Liberties Union has taken her case, and Continental is sticking to its paint and powder rule. Which, the airline points out, was suggested by a group of 16 employees, seven of whom were women, who devised a new appearance code to go with the airline's new image.
New code? Old tradition is more like it. There was the airline that wouldn't let its flight attendants wear eyeglasses . . . the airline that wouldn't trust female employees in non-uniformed jobs to wear normal business attire and made them wear smocks . . . the airline that monitored female flight attendants' weight far more carefully than that of males. All were found by the courts to have discriminated against women.
There's nothing wrong with reasonable dress and appearance codes. But before those Continental code-writers decreed a bit of blush, a puff of powder and a lick of lipstick, they would have done well to ask themselves just what it is a female ticket agent is supposed to be selling.

HEADLINE: New York's Pain: Deeper, Longer

 BODY:
The more one studies Mayor David Dinkins's new budget proposal the worse New York's fiscal crisis looks. The budget confirms that, even assuming some exaggeration for bargaining purposes, the crisis is real and it is deep. What's worse is how long it is projected to last.
Even if New Yorkers learn to do without services like clean streets and libraries while paying higher taxes for the privilege, the problems will not disappear. Unless the economy makes a startling comeback, and nobody can responsibly predict that, the pain will last. 
 Retrenchment, service cuts and tax increases are necessary in the crisis budget for the fiscal year that begins in July. But all this will be perpetuated in future years as well, unless the city and state, itself burdened, can promptly join in deep, difficult reforms that would benefit both.
The Mayor's proposed cuts will hurt just about every aspect of city life. Thanks to the Safe City, Safe Streets plan, law enforcement is the only area for which Mr. Dinkins proposes real growth. The city would hire 1,800 new police officers. Meanwhile, it would eliminate 500,000 vision and hearing screenings for schoolchildren . . . add to the garbage mountain at the Staten Island landfill by suspending recycling for a year . . . cut library funding so much that some branches would probably close . . . cut cultural affairs by 44 percent . . . and cut education so deeply that school officials anticipate losing perhaps 6,500 teachers and 3,500 aides.
The mix of cuts and taxes will change as the Mayor negotiates with the City Council, and the gap may be narrowed if the city gets more revenue from the state and the Municipal Assistance Corporation. But the recession, magnified by policy mistakes the Mayor made in the fall, leaves so serious a problem that deep cuts cannot be avoided in the fiscal year beginning July 1.
So much pain does not have to endure, however, if the city and state will join in fundamental fiscal, tax and management reforms. The Dinkins administration is already pursuing some of those changes and the Citizens Budget Commission urges even more far-reaching reforms. But the city cannot do it without its unofficial partner, the state -- particularly Gov. Mario Cuomo, who has yet to involve himself energetically.
The Mayor supports state takeover of local Medicaid costs, for instance, which would be more equitable for all cities and counties because it would spread the tax burden more evenly. The same is true of welfare. If city and state could work together to lift some forms of rent control, most New Yorkers would benefit, as they would if the city conceded that it undertaxes residential properties and pursued reform legislation.
Those are just a few potential reforms. They would not substitute for a thriving economy, but would at least ease the long-term burden. New Yorkers will have to tighten their belts in the coming year. Joint action now to make the city better run and more competitive can spare them municipal starvation in the future.

HEADLINE: Keep the Heat on Gorbachev

BYLINE: By Hedrick Smith; Hedrick Smith, a fellow of the Johns Hopkins Foreign Policy Institute, is author of "The New Russians."

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
To sort out Soviet politics, Americans need a seasonally adjusted method for interpreting the zigzags of Mikhail Gorbachev. In fall and winter, he typically aligns himself with reactionary forces. But in spring and summer, he turns toward reform and compromise with progressive forces.
He has done it again. After five months of alliance with Communist and military reactionaries, Mr. Gorbachev rebuffed the hard-liners last month, and is now operating in a partnership with his rival, Boris Yeltsin, the Russian Republic leader and champion of the reformers. 
 Mr. Gorbachev's shift reflects a pragmatic concession to the power of republican governments, one that opens an opportunity for American policy. The West can widen its official dealings with republican and local governments to promote long-term democratic and market reforms. Mr. Gorbachev himself offered the means for doing so, asking Washington for a new agricultural credit of $1.5 billion.
Clearly President Bush wants to say yes, but Washington should also spread its bets among the contending forces -- not abandoning President Gorbachev but moving to expand parallel connections at all levels of the fragmented Soviet power structure. Here are some steps that should be taken:
* Amend the 1990 legislation establishing the Support East European Democracy program to include the Soviet Union, so that the U.S. can help train elected legislators, mayors and city council members in the art of democracy. Those reformers confront the hard-line party apparatus and lack experience in governing.
* Invest in building democratic institutions in the Russian Republic and other republics. With only $300,000, the National Endowment for Democracy through the National Democratic Institute has run seminars for Soviet officials on budgets, taxes, services and coalition-building. Some 200 city officials have begun this training, but 20 times that number need help. Multiply the budget tenfold, using Federal money, and it would still pale beside the cost of aid to the Kurds.
* Take advantage of glasnost's daring spirits like the TV journalists of the popular program "Vzglyad" who were thrown off the air last December. They are trying to organize alternative TV and radio outlets to compete with the censored state media. Seed money and secondhand equipment are desperately needed.
* Extend economic advice to republics, regions and city governments that want market reforms. Until now, the Bush Administration has been so worried about offending Mr. Gorbachev that it has only advised the central Government, where the will to create a market is weak.
By contrast, leaders in Moscow, Leningrad and some other cities are eager to promote privatization, free trade zones and wholesale markets, rewrite tax laws and ease customs restrictions and other conditions for joint ventures. Low-cost technical advice offers potentially large returns.
* Channel U.S. aid, especially food and other humanitarian aid, to republican governments rather than to the Kremlin. Let the local reformers get the bonus for delivering food. Last winter, when Mr. Bush granted $1 billion in farm credits, the grain went to Moscow and was distributed by the K.G.B. The leader of Moldavia complained that Mr. Gorbachev was demanding that republic leaders accept his version of a new union treaty as a price for obtaining grain.
* Use this summer's summit meeting of the seven industrialized nations to coordinate aid to Moscow; distribute it in phases, continuing so long as Mr. Gorbachev pursues progressive politics and market economics.
* Insist that the Interior Ministry's black-beret troops stop taking over banks, customs posts, airstrips and other facilities in Lithuania and Latvia. Require as a price of outside help that seized Baltic institutions be returned to local authorities.
* Gradually expand official relations with Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, leading to establishment of what Zbigniew Brzezinski calls "institutes," or veiled U.S. embassies, and get the Baltic states accepted as full members at Helsinki II conference.
In sum, the moment has come for bolder American actions. The object should be to encourage Mr. Gorbachev to stay on a progressive track, -- and to strengthen democratic institutions in case he follows his seasonal pattern and swerves back toward a hard line next fall.

HEADLINE: ON MY MIND;
For China: Action Now

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
Jimmy Carter went to Communist China. He made a speech to Beijing's diplomatic trainees. He spoke privately to China's leaders.
Always, he says, he made a point of supporting amnesty for some political prisoners and the right of Chinese students abroad to visit their country and leave again. 
 Then Mr. Carter returned to Atlanta, and promptly advised the United States to continue the special privilege of minimum tariffs that allows Communist China to sell $15 billion of goods to us annually, about three times more than it buys.
Of course, under various laws and regulations the U.S. is not supposed to give those privileges to countries that do not allow its citizens to come and go freely or which generally act like beasts from hell. Law or not, most Americans would hardly favor giving those privileges to a country that specializes in slave labor, or which occupies and tortures another nation, as China does Tibet.
 The lowest-tariff privileges, known as most-favored-nation status, are supposed to be for friends, not operators of countrywide gulags.
Oh, we get around that, we do. The President just waives the whole thing every year and Beijing goes on selling us the goods it needs to preserve the Communist dictatorship.
But Mr. Bush has to make up his mind any day now on whether he will waive again or state the simple truth that Beijing is in violation of American trading laws and every international human rights agreement.
What with additional disclosures of Communist brutality coming in from China and Tibet every day, and with Beijing shipping nuclear weapon ingredients and technology or missiles to countries all over the world, waiving is becoming more awkward.
China clearly intends to become a major nuclear and missile supplier, which would give it political as well as economic clout. So far it has supplied nuclear material or missiles to Pakistan, Algeria, India, Brazil, Argentina, Syria and South Africa.
Beijing's taste for murder, aggression and death-trade profits is a hot political issue in Congress. The majority wants to grab Beijing's attention by attacking the tariff privileges.
But Mr. Carter advises us not to be so "self-satisfied" about such rights as freedom of speech, press and religion. After all, the former President says, the Communist Chinese and leaders of other "socialist" countries point out "correctly" that in their countries certain rights are respected that the U.S. neglects -- like the right "to have a decent home, a job and adequate health care."
Naturally, neither Mr. Carter's speech nor his advice to the butchers of Beijing were carried by the Chinese press, radio or TV. The outside world knew about it only because of the reports of foreign correspondents in Beijing, printed by the free American press about which we are so unbecomingly self-satisfied.
More embarrassing: Two days after Mr. Carter's Op-Ed comments about human rights in the "socialist countries" were carried in The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal reported from China that not all Chinese have jobs, houses or medical care and in fact between 30 and 50 million of them are wandering the countryside at the moment, searching for any of the three.
So despite Mr. Carter's advice, many members of Congress are demanding that tariff breaks end next year unless the President testifies that Beijing is granting full human rights in China and Tibet and is getting out of the death trade.
 But in separate bills, Senators Daniel P. Moynihan of New York and Jesse Helms of North Carolina are calling for immediate cancellation of the tariff privileges.
Some journalists and Americans in the China trade say that action at once would isolate China. That's a tired argument, historically false. Refusing those privileges to the governments of countries like the Soviet Union or Nicaragua isolated not the people, only the rulers they hated.
There would be a majority for certain action now, not possible action next year, except for fear of a Presidential veto. But human rights advocates in Congress think they could override a veto on a milder bill, to delay action another year but still leave the waiver with the President.
Maybe that is simply human rights politics. But the Communist lords of China have failed for almost a half-century to give their people real human rights, "socialist" or otherwise. It is past time for the United States to refuse to subsidize political tyranny any longer. That is simply human rights truth.

HEADLINE: More Health Care for Less Money

BYLINE: By Joseph A. Califano Jr.; Joseph A. Califano Jr., a lawyer, was Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare from 1977 to 1979.

 BODY:
The $750 billion Americans will spend on health care this year -- and the trillion dollars in 1994 -- should be an opportunity to release the poor from rationing and give all Americans all the health and long-term care they need. Instead, to stem rocketing costs, Richard Darman, Director of the Office of Management and Budget, some legislators and the General Accounting Office suggest rationing health care for all of us.
No politician or bureaucrat has the wisdom to decide who should suffer how much pain for how long, who should walk and who should limp, who will live and who will die -- and when. Here are some ways to free up resources to provide all Americans with the care they need for what we are now spending, or less. 
 Revamp the medical malpractice system. The Bush Administration is right to use Federal programs to prod state malpractice reform. We should develop standards of care to establish under what circumstances which medical procedures work. Any doctor who follows those standards should have a defense to any charge of malpractice. Where providers are negligent, states should limit recovery for pain and suffering and sharply reduce contingent legal fees.
Relax the doctors' monopoly over the practice of medicine. Once essential to protect patients from quacks and charlatans, the doctors' monopoly is now an economic hammerlock that keeps costs high and denies us the savings and efficiencies of modern technology. Today, trained nurses can perform all sorts diagnoses and treatments of common ailments like respiratory diseases, sprains and breaks, just as competently and far less expensively than doctors. Midwives can handle normal deliveries. These physican assistants earn less than half the income of doctors.
Require that insurers and managed care plans compete on the basis of service and price, not on the basis of who can attract the most low cost patients. Now most insurers and managed care plans vie for the healthiest beneficiaries. If all plans were community based -- with rates determined by the needs of the entire community -- and were required to cover anyone who could pay, they would be forced to compete on the basis of price, service and efficiency.
Medicare, Medicaid and private insurers should refuse to reimburse (or at least reduce payments to) hospitals operating at less than 60 percent capacity. We've got to eliminate the inexcusable level of excess capacity in our hospitals. Residents of towns with hospitals where doctors and nurses don't perform operations enough to maintain proficiency, much less attain excellence, would be better off investing in a first-class primary care clinic and a helicopter. Insurers would save money by paying for of such transportation rather than to keep the hospital open.
Eliminate the pharmacists' monopoly over dispensing drugs. The era of doctors writing in Latin and pharmacists mixing powders and potions is long gone. Today, virtually all prescriptions can be filled by anyone who can read and count. Mail order houses do it and some provide prescriptions for as little as 50 cents an order. The cost at retail pharmacies is three to 10 times higher. Pharmacists can help counsel about potential drug interactions, but their monopoly over filling more than a billion prescriptions a year is rooted in self-interest, not consumer protection.
Change the way we pay doctors. It's time to pay doctors to talk with us, not just to do something to us. Fees for such consultation are better spent, particularly when physicians are talking about health promotion and life style changes. It's also time to pay family practitioners more and some specialists less. Medicare is moving in this direction; private insurers should follow.
There are other things we can do to reduce costs. Insurers and the Government should promote disease prevention with financial incentives to take care of ourselves. And everyone involved in the health care industry should sign a paperwork nonproliferation treaty. Electronic processing, standardizing and simplifying claims and audit procedures could save a quarter of the more than $100 billion we will spend this year to administer the system.
Before politicians and bureaucrats resort to rationing for everyone, they should stop tinkering and make fundamental changes in the way we deliver care. Then we can provide high quality care to all -- rather than a declining quality of care to some.

HEADLINE: South Africa Needs Loans for Democratization

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The imminent elimination of repressive racial laws in South Africa is, as you state in "The Last Days of Apartheid" (editorial, April 24), only a part of the job of establishing a truly democratic society. Few can be more aware than South Africans of the tremendous challenges ahead.
As has been recognized internationally, the successful transformation of South African society is vitally dependent on the country's rebuilding its economy. I therefore welcome your view that the United States should not defer lifting sanctions when South Africa has complied with the minimum conditions of the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act. 
 However, I am astonished by your suggestion that, to preserve some leverage after sanctions have been phased out, Washington use its voting veto at the International Monetary Fund to deprive South Africa of I.M.F. loans until a true democracy has come about.
Decades of apartheid and years of destructive international sanction measures have left South Africa with a zero-growth economy incapable of meeting the demands of high population growth, let alone the aspirations of the black population. It has resulted in growing unemployment and insufficient capital for the huge backlog in housing, education and job creation. The increasingly difficult economic situation contributes to the wave of violence and crime being experienced and seriously threatens democratization.
Immediate access to international finance is the crux for successful transition in South Africa. The recent warning by Chris Stals, governor of the South African Reserve Bank, that if poor economic performance continues, South Africa will be ungovernable by 1995, should not be taken lightly. For you to propose delay of South Africa's access to I.M.F. loans condemns South Africa to being a country unable to borrow extensively for growth. Linked to I.M.F. borrowings, of course, are the opportunities to raise funds from the international capital market and commercial banks around the world.
Your proposal would jeopardize the future financing of the democratic option for which so many of us are striving.

HEADLINE: South Africa Needs Loans for Democratization;
Enriched by Apartheid

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The statement by South Africa's Foreign Minister, P. W. Botha, that he hopes the United States and other countries will offer economic aid to apartheid's black victims, creates an interesting picture: that of wealthy white South Africans with their often lavish life style expecting the American taxpayer to subsidize these white foreigners, who are responsible for apartheid's misery in the first place.
Such a picture is not entirely uncharitable to white South Africa, for its whites have shown a strong reluctance to make any reparations to the blacks for apartheid's shameful exploitations. Development Minister Gerritt Viljoen, for instance, has insisted that there will be "no expropriation of land without compensation" to its legal (under apartheid's laws) owners. Apartheid -- especially including the historically false "homelands" system -- apportions 35 times more land to whites, per person, than to blacks. Blacks made poor by apartheid will be expected to buy back their own land from whites made rich by apartheid. 
 And the blacks are poor indeed through apartheid. Last October it was disclosed that on a large fruit farm, one of whose trustees is President F. W. de Klerk, black workers were being paid barely $40 a month for a 60-hour week and were fined $15 if they ate any of the fruit they picked.
It is rarely realized outside South Africa that by corralling, with racist laws, nearly all South Africa's good farmland and most of its vast mineral riches for themselves, the white South Africans' debt to the blacks runs into dozens of billions of dollars. (Example: some years ago The Financial Mail of South Africa reported that each year, whites profited by $2 billion from land transactions and rent, while five times as many blacks had effectively no income from land at all.)
Apartheid has made its white creators enormously rich. They should be made to pay their own debts, at last. To pay the blacks a proper wage for a hard day's work might be a good start.

HEADLINE: Arizona Catacombs Yield Clues to a Vanished People

BYLINE: By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD

DATELINE: SPRINGERVILLE, Ariz.

 BODY:
FROM the rim of the broad mesa, as a dust devil whistled its way across dry grassland like a whirling apparition, John W. Hohmann looked down the slope on the stone ruins of a prehistoric pueblo. Some 700 years ago this was a village of the Mogollon, a hunting and farming people. Now it was his archeological domain.
Few sites of pre-Columbian life in North America explored in recent years have aroused so much curiosity and excitement, even extravagant expectations and simmering controversy. Archeologists expect the ruins, called Casa Malpais, to cast new light on the mysterious Mogollon (pronounced MUG-gy-own), who seemingly vanished by the year 1450.
But here they lived for more than a century, hunting deer and antelope on the mesa and growing corn and beans in the green valley of the Little Colorado River below. On natural terraces, formed of collapsed basalt from an ancient volcano, they built a housing complex of stone, clay, timbers and brush. They erected an unusually large kiva, or ceremonial building, whose size marks it as a possible religious center. 
 "We don't know where these people went or what happened to them," said Mr. Hohmann, an archeologist with the private consulting company of Louis Berger and Associates in Phoenix. "That's a mystery we hope to solve."
Deep beneath the dwellings and kiva lay the most astonishing surprise, which Mr. Hohmann and two other archeologists discovered last summer. Crawling and squeezing through natural fissures in the dull reddish basalt, they came upon sacred chambers where the Mogollon had interred their dead.
In an announcement to the Society of American Archeology two weeks ago, Mr. Hohmann described the burial chambers as catacombs and said these were the first known to have been used by prehistoric people north of Mexico. Other archeologists agree that catacombs had not been found before in the United States.
"We've seen that Indians used caves for burials," Mr. Hohmann said. "But we've never heard about these types of fissures being so culturally modified. All that labor and community effort to seal up the chambers, conceal entrances and make other architectural changes is truly remarkable."
Except for the discoverers, visitors are not allowed in the catacombs, out of respect for the dead. Yet the magnitude of the discovery can be sensed by climbing down a ladder into a nearby cavern that was presumably never used for burials. One narrow chamber opened into a larger one, some 20 feet high, 30 feet long and no more than 12 feet wide, flanked by walls of basalt smooth and cool to the touch.
Mr. Hohmann said that he and his colleagues, Diane E. White and Christopher D. Adams, had explored three to four acres of intricate catacombs similar to this cavern. A few of the rooms were 50 feet high and 100 feet long. The Mogollon had carefully laid stones in the terrain above to close cracks in the ceilings.
Several hundred graves were found -- bones arranged under stone cairns, in stone cribs and in wall niches. Once there may have been even more human remains, and possibly ceramics, tools and other artifacts. But no such grave goods have been uncovered. The archeologists suspect looters got there first.
 Nevertheless, the find is seen as an economic godsend in Springerville, a town of fewer than 2,000 people about two miles from the ruins.
Officials of Springerville estimate that if Casa Malpais could become a national park or monument, it would bring in $3 million to $5 million annually from tourism. People have opened a small museum on Main Street, offering tours of the ruins. In addition to the usual rodeo on the Fourth of July, a promotion of local archeology will feature an Indiana Jones look-alike contest for children.
 
Tough Time in Rural America
 State archeologists are apprehensive that modern Indians, sensitive to any appearance of desecration of ancestral remains and sacred places, will be angry. Other archeologists have begun to quibble over the use of the word "catacombs" to characterize the burial site.
Mr. Hohmann winces at comparisons with the fictional archeological swashbuckler that find their way into many news reports. He is a young archeologist completing his doctoral dissertation at Arizona State University, not on lost arks, but on the social complexity of ancient Americans.
The dig was commissioned and partly financed by Springerville and the neighboring town of Eagar to lay the groundwork for a recreational park that would capitalize on the ruins, long known to local people but never fully explored by scientists. In compliance with the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, the site had to be investigated for archeological treasures before development.
Mr. Hohmann said the plan he was drawing up was for the conservation of the ruins, along with some continuing scientific research, within a park setting. Local people hope this will attract tourists to this out-of-the-way place near the New Mexico border, four to five hours' drive from any major city.
Brandee Snyder, a volunteer working at the museum, said: "This is rural America, and we're having a tough time economically. The lumber mill is closed. We see this as a chance that people won't have to leave our community."
But the hoopla puts Mr. Hohmann in an embarrassing position because it came swiftly before he could inform modern Native Americans of the discovery.
 
Amicable Pacts With Tribes
 Lynn Teague, a curator at the Arizona State Museum in Tucson, said that some of the tribes "are very distressed by all the publicity," though their representatives have yet to make any public comments about the catacombs. Under a new state law, archeologists are supposed to notify officials of all 20 Indian tribes in Arizona when any human remains are excavated. Even though the law was not in effect when the catacombs were found, Mrs. Teague said the museum was inviting the tribes to send representatives to inspect Casa Malpais and discuss their concerns.
As many as 40 states now have similar laws, and Federal legislation went into effect last year regulating the handling of human remains found on Government lands and by federally financed institutions. Indian skeletons and grave goods already in museums must be returned to tribes for reburial, if requested.
Dr. Dennis Stanford, an anthropologist at the Smithsonian Institution who specializes in prehistoric America, said that so far negotiations with tribes have ended amicably. Cave burials found recently in the Aleutian Islands were being investigated with the cooperation of the Aleuts, he said.
Mr. Hohmann's dealings with fellow archeologists could also turn bumpy. Several researchers have expressed doubts that the discovery qualifies as true catacombs, a subterranean cemetery consisting of galleries with recesses for tombs.
"I have mixed feelings about calling them catacombs," said Dr. Charles A. Hoffman, professor of archeology at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff. "When we say catacombs, we think of Rome and the early Christians and their elaborate underground burial chambers."
Miss White, one of the discoverers, stands by the designation. "There's always debate in archeology over definitions," she said. "What else would you call underground features with human remains that have clearly been modified by people to serve as a burial place?"
But no one is disputing the potential significance of the ruins of Casa Malpais.
Dr. Stanford said the pueblo, kiva and catacombs "might give us a whole new look at Mogollon society, its organization and structure and rituals, none of which is well known."
"In terms of ethnohistory," Dr. Hoffman said, "the discoveries are important because they will be filling a gap in our knowledge between the historic Indians, like the Zuni, and the earlier prehistoric people."
Three distinctive prehistoric cultures dominated the American Southwest between the years 300 and 1450. In southern Arizona and northern Mexico lived the Hohokam, whose descendants may include the modern Papagos. Across northern Arizona and New Mexico and into Utah and Colorado, the Anasazi were the master builders of pueblos on the sides of canyon walls. The Mogollon were a mountain people living mainly in central Arizona and New Mexico. The Zuni and Tarhuamar Indians are thought to be their descendants.
Dr. Edward B. Danson, director of the Museum of Northern Arizona at Flagstaff, surveyed the Casa Malpais site in 1948 as part of the Harvard Peabody Museum's Upper Gila expedition. Told of the ruins by local people, he climbed there and found the stone walls of the kiva still standing, the foundations of several dwellings and a staircase leading to the mesa above.
But busy archeologists never gave it a second thought, until the people of Springerville decided they wanted to turn it into a park. Mr. Hohmann's team began systematic excavations at Casa Malpais last summer and expects to continue another year or two. The archeologists have found the stone outlines of as many as 100 rooms in a kind of apartment-building complex where the people lived. Some of the rooms are small, no more than 6 feet by 9, with some others much larger. In one room being excavated, a fireplace is visible in the center and fragments of pottery have been collected.
 
Too Early for Conclusions
 Mr. Hohmann said the typical dwelling had walls of boulders and clay mortar and roofs of poles and brush. Wood fragments buried there have enabled scientists at the University of Arizona, examining tree rings, to date the construction to as early as 1265. Ceramics indicate that the village must have been abandoned soon after 1380.
Most of the dwellings are on the same terrace with the great kiva. Remains of its stone walls stand 6 feet high and reveal that the building was about 50 feet square, an impressive size for such ceremonial centers. A bench of stone and clay bordered the interior wall on all sides, and in the center is a depression where the fireplace had been.
Among the pottery uncovered are reddish-brown jars and bowls typical of Mogollon culture. But others have black and white geometric designs that archeologists believe indicate the Mogollon had considerable contact with the Anasazi to the north. The pueblo architecture also appears to show an Anasazi influence.
On the lower terraces, Mr. Hohmann said, areas cleared of stone are thought to have been gardens. But the people probably did most of their farming along the river, their one reliable source of water.
 
Drought May Be the Culprit
 A rift in one of the higher terraces provides a protected area where, as grinding stones indicate, the people must have prepared their corn meal and made stone tools. On the walls are drawings of animals, including a huge centipede, and human footprints and "stick men" figures. Also, vandals have left graffiti.
Archeologists suspect that devastating drought, not defeat by intruders, eventually drove the Mogollon from Casa Malpais.
Mr. Hohmann climbed over huge chunks of basalt toward the rear of the pueblo and the face of the cliff. He reached the hidden staircase Dr. Danson had described. It spiraled upward between walls of rock. The Mogollon had laid smooth stepping stones and chipped out handholds right where they were indispensable.
At the top of the mesa, Mr. Hohmann could watch the archeologists bent at their digging in the baking sun. Beyond was the valley of the White Mountains where the Apache, a nomadic hunting people, came to replace the Mogollon, and then Spanish sheepherders replaced the Apache and finally the pioneer Henry Springer established his trading post in 1879 -- one broad vista of prehistory and history.

HEADLINE: Heads That Roll if Computers Fail

BYLINE: By GLENN RIFKIN

 BODY:
The last decade has brought chief information officers, the executives who manage corporate computer systems, into the upper ranks of their companies. But their prominence has come with a price: When something with the computers goes wrong, they often get the blame and the dismissal notices.
Martin Stein arrived at the BankAmerica Corporation 10 months ago as the fourth chief information officer in six years. Mr. Stein professes to be unafraid. "At Paine Webber, there were eight C.I.O.'s in six years," he said, referring to his previous post. "I consider this job low risk." 
 Mr. Stein's experience is hardly unusual. More than a third of 600 chief information officers said in a survey that their predecessors had been dismissed or demoted, according to Deloitte & Touche, the consulting and accounting firm.
The chief information officers, who go by a variety of formal titles, have become vulnerable as computer networks grow more sophisticated and companies' demands on them multiply. Cost-conscious companies whose systems fail to meet their sometimes extravagant expectations often hold their chief information officers responsible.
More top executives are learning enough about computers to become dangerous to those directly responsible for the machines. "The mystique is coming out of information technology," said DuWayne Peterson, the chief information officer at Merrill Lynch. "This puts some C.I.O.'s at risk because they once had a niche that no one else understood."
But some computer managers themselves say the turnover results as much from their own failings as from scapegoating. Trained as technicians, they must think more like other business people to survive.
"There is a fundamental change happening in the profession," said Michael Simmons, group vice president in charge of technology and operations at the Bank of Boston. "Technology is changing so fast that we haven't learned how to manage it. C.I.O.'s have to become managers rather than tech nerds and a lot just don't make that transition."
More chief executives are asking the question many computer managers dread: What is the company getting for all that money? Though corporations continue to spend billions of dollars on technology, white-collar productivity has stagnated. No longer are chief executives confident that throwing computers at their office staffs will result in greater efficiency, said Stephen Roach, an economist at Morgan Stanley. Major computer suppliers, including the International Business Machines Corporation, are facing declining sales, especially for their largest systems.
"If the C.I.O. cannot reduce his own cost structure, then he is destined to extinction," Mr. Roach said. "Information technology has to be directed, bottom line, to productivity enhancement."
The current recession is causing many chief executives to take a harder look at technology spending. Computer managers have to justify every dollar of what, for many companies, is the single largest capital expense. In a recent survey of 200 chief executives and chief financial officers by Computerworld newspaper and Andersen Consulting, more than half doubted that their companies were getting the full benefit of their computer investments.
 
'Serious Technology Bets'
 Chief information officers are often buried under an avalanche of technological change. New computer architectures, networking, open systems, and powerful desktop computers linked to even more powerful, specialized machines called servers confound anyone trying to make decisions as simply as they did a decade ago. "There are serious technology bets that have to be placed in most corporations now," said Bill Laberis, editor of Computerworld, a leading industry publication. "Is the profession up to handling this change? In many cases, the answer is no."
In the 1980's, the failure of many companies to achieve major advantages over their competitors after investing heavily in computers damaged the reputations of many computer managers. As professional information systems people, "we have just about lost it," said Henry Spencer, assistant vice president of Cigna Systems, the computer operations of the Cigna Corporation. "There are countless examples in most major corporations of late or never-completed projects and cost overruns."
H. Ross Perot, chairman of Perot Data Systems, said many major computer projects were ill conceived. "They went from massive funding to massive implementation to failure," Mr. Perot said.
Many new computer managers find they have to clean up messes left behind by predecessors or consultants. Mr. Simmons -- who preceded Mr. Stein at BankAmerica before joining the Bank of Boston a year ago -- found the Boston company using 11 different brands of large computers. "They were shell-shocked," Mr. Simmons said. "They had listened to a consultant in the mid-1980's who told them to decentralize everything, and they didn't realize they would have to put everything back together eventually." He has already cut back to seven computer makers, and plans to end up with four.
Mr. Simmons is used to inheriting snarled systems. At BankAmerica, he stepped in after management had scuttled an $80 million system designed to automate the employee benefits and trust departments.
The most savvy technology managers now speak of re-engineering company operations, not just computerizing antiquated processes. For 25 years, the old data processing departments focused on automating backroom procedures. "We automated everything just because it was there," Mr. Simmons said. "We were taking the same bandy-legged horse and putting him in a faster race."
Now, computer managers try to introduce new, streamlined techniques. The Ford Motor Company was able to cut its 500-member accounts payable department by 75 percent. Rather than having rows of clerks manually match suppliers' invoices with Ford's purchase orders and receipt records, then authorize payment, a constantly updated computer data base matches purchase orders and receipts automatically -- with no invoices required -- and the computer authorizes payment.
Not that such thorough changes are easy to bring about. As F. Warren McFarlan, a Harvard Business School expert in information technology, said, "People look at glitzy examples of technology implementation and they overlook how complex it is to drive these processes through."
Many large companies, searching for ways to cut costs, have turned their computer operations over to outsiders like I.B.M., Electronic Data Systems or Perot Data Systems. Earlier this month, Continental Airlines signed a 10-year agreement handing over its computer reservation system to E.D.S. Such "outsourcing" has many chief information officers worried about the future of their departments.
Proponents of outsourcing point to potential savings. Kathy Hudson, chief information officer at the Eastman Kodak Company, said the company's agreement in late 1989 for I.B.M. to run its data center has cut annual capital spending on technology to $3 million from nearly $60 million. The collaboration has succeeded beyond all expectations, she said, although she would not disclose I.B.M.'s fee.
But some managers point to companies whose own computer staffs have scored major victories. John Hammitt, the chief information officer of the United Technologies Corporation, mentions American Airlines' Sabre reservation system and American Hospital Supply's ASAP system for delivering orders. "Technology can be a powerful weapon and still bring competitive advantage," he said. "We'll have a few more surprises in the next few years."
Many in the industry, however, have grown tired of hearing about these same few examples over and over. Max Hopper, the chief information officer of American Airlines responsible for much of Sabre's success, says that the era when large new computer systems can bring insurmountable advantages is over. "Hitting the big home runs has become almost impossible," because computer technology has become so pervasive, he said.
 
In the Middle
 Competitive pressures are squeezing computer systems managers as never before, he said. "Introducing change is tough," Mr. Hopper said. "If the C.I.O. drives it too fast, the C.E.O. hears complaints that systems is buying technology just for technology's sake. But if he doesn't move fast enough, he hears how Company X down the street just put in a new whiz-bang system and why don't we have it here."
Consultants say that instead of blaming chief information officers for every glitch, senior managers ought to become more involved in their computer departments.
But the top executives most likely to stay involved and support their computer managers are those who once managed computer operations themselves. "The best systems are in companies where the C.E.O. once had responsibility for technology and understood what systems could do," Mr. Perot said. "When a C.E.O. wants something new, he should spend time with the systems people rather than send it through three levels of command."

HEADLINE: Despite Rights Issue, Chinese Hope U.S. Trade Status Stays

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING

 BODY:
As a battle looms in Washington over whether to end normal trade relations with China, many Chinese are finding themselves reluctantly siding with their hard-line rulers in hoping that the status is maintained.
While they appreciate the concern for human rights in their country and hope that the debate will force the Government to become less repressive, some worry that a cutoff of so-called most-favored-nation status would hurt their standard of living, harm the most reformist segments of the economy and prompt the hard-liners to restrict contacts with the United States. 
 It is impossible to be sure of public opinion in so vast and tightly controlled a country as China. But in informal conversations with dozens of Chinese in several parts of the country over recent months, most of those who were aware of the issue did not favor American economic sanctions and hoped that most-favored-nations benefits would be extended.
President Bush's annual recommendation on whether to renew the preferential trade status for China is required by June 3. He is expected to favor renewal, and opponents in Congress are expected to introduce legislation to overturn the decision.
In their first breath, urban Chinese intellectuals typically tell their trusted American friends how much they detest their leadership. In their second breath, they express affection for the United States and inquire about getting visas. And in their third breath, they worry that harsh American sanctions would hurt the Chinese people rather than their leaders.
"If I were President Bush, I would extend most-favored-nation status to China," said Zhang Weiguo, a Shanghai dissident who was unusual only in that he was willing to have his name published. "The U.S. should support China's economic development and social exchanges."
Mr. Zhang's anti-Government credentials are not in doubt. He was arrested after the 1989 Tiananmen crackdown and spent 20 months in prison before being released earlier this year, still unrepentant and fuming at the Government.
Mr. Zhang said the best result would be for a tough battle over Chinese trade in Washington, ending in an extension for another year. Such a close call would encourage China to make concessions on human rights and would leave the issue open for another fight next year, he said.
"Every year it's discussed, and that's very good," Mr. Zhang said. "It puts new pressure on China each year."
A downgrading of American trade links with China would mean a large rise in the tariffs imposed on Chinese goods shipped to the United States, and would hurt its thriving export sector. The south of China, which has the most developed private economy in the country, would be particularly affected, as would Hong Kong, through which Chinese goods usually pass for packaging or transshipment.
Many dissidents say they would like the United States and other countries to be even more outspoken in supporting Chinese human rights. Above all, they would like Prime Minister Li Peng and other hard-liners to lose "face."But they worry that economic sanctions are the wrong method.
"People are very torn inside," said a university student in Beijing. "They want pressure on the Government to change its policies, and they want the leadership to eat bitterness. But on the other hand, they're afraid that if sanctions are imposed, it's the ordinary people who would suffer. So we want America to threaten sanctions to pressure China, but we don't want sanctions themselves."
 
Peasants Seem Less Aware
 Among Chinese peasants and workers, especially outside the capital, there seems to be much less awareness of the issue of sanctions, as well as less anger at the Government. Consequently, many people do not have clearly formed ideas on the subject, but frequently seem vaguely opposed to any sanctions that might compound the economic difficulties of the last couple of years. And some wealthier people fear that sanctions would make it more difficult to buy foreign products.
"The fear is that if M.F.N. were cut off, the price of a pack of Marlboros would go up," said an entrepreneur.

Bush Picks Envoy to China
 WASHINGTON, May 14 (AP) -- President Bush said today that he would nominate J. Stapleton Roy, a State Department officials, as Ambassador to China, succeeding James Rodrick Lilley.
Mr. Roy, 55 years old, of Bethesda, Md., is special assistant to Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and executive secretary of the State Department. A former Ambassador to Singapore, he was deputy chief of the United States liaison office and later the American mission in China from 1978 to 1981.
He was born in Nanjing of missionary parents.

HEADLINE: Port Newark: Busy Corner Of Commerce And Worries

BYLINE: By PETER KERR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEWARK, May 14

 BODY:
Everything seems outsized in the Port of New York and New Jersey, the docks around New York Harbor that have dominated the Atlantic maritime trade since the 1600's.
Here at Port Newark, the larger port's heart, an ship carrying orange juice arrives every month, brimming with enough concentrate to fill 40 million glasses. A Toyota ship disgorges 900 vehicles in a matter of hours. On other nearby docks, workers move mountains of salt, piles of Portuguese paving stones, hills of cars that have been flattened, cubed or diced into scrap. 
 "The port is an entire world of its own," said the Rev. Jean R. Smith of the Seaman's Institute Church, one of two churches that minister to the thousands of sailors who dock at the major slips in Newark and Elizabeth, just across the New Jersey Turnpike from Newark International Airport. "Most people drive by and only see planes landing at the airport. They have no idea of what goes on here."
 
Half-Billion Dollars
 Each day more than 15,000 trucks enter the main cargo areas here through gates that look much like highway toll booths. A computer system directs each of the truck cabs to one of the thousands of spaces where freight containers are parked. The 40-by-8-foot containers can hold 15 tons or more of cargo, anything from M & M's to VCR's.
In recent years there the level of activity has been stable in the sprawling warehouses and docks that line not only the shorefront at Newark and Elizabeth but also smaller docks in Brooklyn and on Staten Island.
But in other ports, new trade patterns have increased the flow of cargo.
In 1981, New York handled cargo worth $11 billion more than Los Angeles and Long Beach combined. In 1989, the latest year for which figures are available, New York's $49 billion in goods was $6 billion less than in Los Angeles and only $7 billion more than in Long Beach. And on the East Coast, ports with less expensive operations for loading and unloading containerized cargo, like Halifax, Nova Scotia; Baltimore and Norfolk, Va., have cut heavily into New York's position as the premier port in the trans-Atlantic trade.
As a result, the agency that manages the port, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, plans to spend a half-billion dollars in the next five years to improve the harbor and its docks.
"We are in a real fight," said Stanley Brezenoff, the Port Authority's executive director. "We used to be the de facto port for the Eastern Seaboard. Now we have to fight for market share. But we believe with increased trade from the European Community after 1992 and the opening of Eastern Europe, we can greatly increase our role."
For most New Yorkers, consciousness of New York Harbor as a sea cargo hub disappeared when cargo piers vanished from the West Side of Manhattan. They were replaced largely by new containerized operations in Newark and Elizabeth. In fact, the port seethes with activity year round and provides the metropolitan region with what the Port Authority estimates as more than 200,000 jobs.
 
Danglng From Ropes
 At dockside here in Newark, cranes 18 stories tall lower devices that look like giant four-legged spiders, which hook onto the corners of containers to raise or lower them off ships where they are stacked seven stories high.
Men known as lashers dangle from ropes as they secure the containers with rods, chains or cables in an occupation that is highly dangerous, particularly on winter days when all metal surfaces are coated with ice.
One section of the docks here is devoted to foodstuffs, including a pier that handles only bananas. At least once a month, a Brazilian freighter ties up at the orange juice dock, where hissing hoses suck out 400,000 gallons of cold concentrate, bright orange and thick as jam. Silver refrigerator trucks then carry the concentrate to factories around the region where every gallon is mixed with five gallons of water.
At another warehouse on the Newark docks, a factory melts, casts, rolls and coils 90,000 tons of copper tubing a year, enough copper, port officials estimate, to construct several hundred Statues of Liberty.
A short distance away ships built like floating parking lots discharge fleets of Japanese and European cars. Similar ships load American automobiles that have been shipped by train from factories across the United States for export.
Not everything here takes on gargantuan dimensions. Next to the offices of the Foreign Auto Preparation Service, a family-owned business that prepares 100,000 imported cars each year for delivery to dealers, John LoBue, the company's president, maintains a tiny garden with strawberry and tomato plants, an apple tree and a small waterfall.
 
Floating Parking Lots
 "After years of looking at automobiles," Mr. LoBue said as he stood in front of a shipment of Chevrolet Caprices being prepared for shipment to Kuwait, "I wanted to see something more than automobiles."
Although New York has remained the largest port on the Atlantic, receiving more than 5,200 ships a year, high labor costs have put it at an economic disadvantage in competing for the imports and exports of America's industries.
The port's labor costs date back to the 1960's when the system of shipping cargo loose in a ship's hold, or break bulk, was replaced by shipping in containers. Although far fewer dockworkers were required to load and unload containerized cargo, the surplus unionized workers continued through an assessment on all containers passing through the port.
In the agreement with the International Longshoremen's Association, more than 20,000 dockworkers were guaranteed employment although far fewer workers were needed -- the largest ship requires 60 to 80 workers. Through deaths and retirements, the port now employs about 5,200 longshoremen although, James Malone, the general manager of the port's New Jersey Marine Terminals, said the port needs only about 4,000.
 
New York as Target
 The ports' labor costs have now begun to decline, officials say. But in recent years the quality of services at competing ports has been vastly improved.
"Ports like Halifax, Norfolk and Baltimore were making hundreds of million of dollars in investments in facilities," said Lillian Liburdi, the director of the agency's port department. "New York has been the target."
The Port Authority's plans call for the dredging of a 40-foot channel to accommodate new cargo vessels with deeper drafts. It also plans to improve warehouses, add new rail lines that will take trains onto the docks and establish a new computer system that will give customers instant information on where their cargo is and when it is expected to arrive.
Such expansions are expected to strain further the two churches that minister to the thousands of sailors passing through, a Catholic Stella Maris Chapel, a church in a trailer with a steeple, and the Seaman's Institute Church, which provides Protestant ministers, a restaurant and a gift shop.
Ms. Smith, an Episcopal minister, said many sailors arrive at her church racked by loneliness, often desperate to phone home to learn of births, deaths and the health of family members. The church provides telephones for sailors to call home, and when ships remain in port for only several hours, church members go on board to take cellular phones to the seamen.
The church has also married sailors, counseled stowaways and helped seamen quickly obtain everything from perfume to a prosthesis.
"We are," she said, "a full-service ministry."

HEADLINE: Consumer Prices Up A Modest 0.2% in April

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 14

 BODY:
The prices that consumers pay for goods and services rose a modest two-tenths of 1 percent in April despite a sharp jump in food costs and the first increase in gasoline prices since November, the Government reported today.
The Labor Department said the small increase in its Consumer Price Index came after a rare drop of one-tenth of 1 percent in March and left consumer inflation rising at an annual rate of 2.5 percent through the first four months of the year. 
 The underlying "core" rate of inflation -- taking out the volatile food and energy sectors -- rose the same two-tenths of 1 percent in April after a rise of one-tenth in March.
 
Constrained by Weak Demand
 Analysts said producers had largely been unable to raise prices because of weak demand during the recession.
"Inflation is under control," said Sandra Shaber, an economist with the Futures Group. "The biggest worry is the recession and jobs."
The 2.5 percent annual rate of inflation in the first four months of this year compares with a 6.1 percent jump in prices during 1990, a time when the oil shock following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait sent energy prices spiraling.
In April, the Government said energy prices fell seven-tenths of 1 percent. But the decline was just one-third of the March drop. While declines were posted for home heating oil and natural gas, the cost of gasoline went up by two-tenths. Analysts said pump prices were rising even faster in May as oil companies raised prices at the start of the vacation driving season.
 
Vegetables and Fruits Higher
 Food prices rose seven-tenths of 1 percent in April, the biggest jump since a winter freeze sent prices shooting up in January. Nearly 95 percent of the April increase was attributed to higher vegetable and fruit prices. Vegetable costs were up 15.4 percent, the biggest rise in 15 months, with the increase attributed to adverse weather and insect problems harming tomato and corn crops in Florida.
Fruit costs were pushed higher by another increase in orange prices, which have risen 64.4 percent since the start of the year.
Analysts said that the moderation in the "core" inflation rate was particularly good news after a sharp jump in earlier months caused by increases in such things as women's clothing, postage stamps and alcoholic beverages.
For April, women's clothing prices fell by 1.4 percent although men's and children's clothing posted increases.
Costs for health care rose five-tenths of 1 percent, the smallest increase in two years.
Other categories showing major shifts included airline fares, down 6.2 percent, and entertainment costs, up seven-tenths of 1 percent, a price rise attributed to higher ticket costs for sporting events and movies. Tobacco prices were up 1.2 percent while school tuition costs rose 1.1 percent last month, reflecting higher costs for day care.
The various changes left the Consumer Price Index, before adjusting for seasonal factors, at 135.2 in April, up from 128.9 a year ago. That means that a market basket of goods costing $100 in the 1982-84 base period would have cost $135.20 last month, up from $128.90 in April 1990.

HEADLINE: C.D.'s and Bank Funds Down 11th Week

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields on certificates of deposit and money market accounts were down for the week ended yesterday, the 11th consecutive decline.
The size of the weekly drop was smaller than the week before, which followed a cut in bank prime rates. 
 Analysts at The Bank Rate Monitor said that at the current rate of decline, yields on bank money market accounts would be bumping against those offered on regular passbook accounts sometime in July.
The odds favor interest rates remaining flat for a long time when the bottom is finally reached, said Robert K. Heady, publisher of the interest-rate publication.
At the Treasury Department's weekly auction held Monday, the average discount rates were only slightly different from a week ago, but still at their lowest levels in three years. The results of these bill auctions often indicate what many banks may eventually pay on money market accounts and certificates of deposit.
The three-month bill was unchanged at 5.5 percent, while the six-month bill increased a couple of basis points, to 5.63 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
In The Bank Rate Monitor's weekly survey of banks in the New York area, declines reported at the commercial banks and savings insitutions were moderate in size.
The largest yield changes for banks in the New York area were recorded at the People's Bank of Connecticut, which cut 16 basis points off both the money market account and six-month certificate, to 5.38 percent and 5.92 percent, respectively. Goldome lowered the yield of its three-month certificate by a similar same amount, to 5.92 percent.
Commercial banks cut deposit yields slightly, compared with the cuts made by savings institutions. Money market accounts and three-month C.D.'s were lowered by 2 basis points, to 5.25 percent and 5.66 percent, respectively, while a six-month certificate slipped 3 basis points, to 5.79 percent.

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC SCENE;
Second Thoughts On Mexico Trade

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
THE campaign for "fast track" authority to negotiate a trade agreement with Mexico is nearly over, and the Administration seems headed for a lopsided victory. The President's strategy, a mix of high-minded talk about global competitiveness and coolly calculated concessions to interests ranging from anti-pesticide lobbyists to brewers, has apparently succeeded in isolating hard-core protectionists from the what's-in-it-for-my-district pragmatists.
But not every defender of free trade is breaking out the margaritas. One of the most articulate, Jagdish Bhagwati, an economist at Columbia University and the author of "The World Trading System at Risk" (Princeton University Press), is downright glum. The fight to open the border with Mexico is a diversion from the more important issue of global trade liberalization, he argues, "encouraging sloppy thinking that all trade is good." 
 Intractable opposition to the free-trade pact can be traced to the usual suspects: unions that fear competition from low-wage Mexican workers and a handful of industries that believe they can prosper only in a protectionist hothouse.
Mr. Bush did not challenge them head-on, preferring to rally the uncommitted with rosy visions of increased exports and decreased illegal immigration while quietly assuaging more parochial qualms. The Administration's 80-page "action plan" promises to hold Mexico to tough standards on pollution, child labor and worker safety. It also promises adequate financing for displaced worker programs. And it tosses a bouquet to agribusiness, which is promised quick relief if the competition grows too fierce, too fast. Mr. Bhagwati's objections are not so easily finessed. The point of open trade, he notes, is to increase the total value of output by allowing specialization in the goods that countries produce relatively cheaply. Opening one border in a world riddled with restrictions may actually reduce efficiency by diverting natural trade flows.
Without a free-trade agreement with the United States, Mexico might buy machine tools from Switzerland because they are cheaper than equivalent American equipment. But once the border is open, the higher tariff on Swiss tools would tip the competitive balance to American manufacturers.
This "trade diversion" argument has not been heard much since the 1960's, when economists tangled over the consequences of a European Common Market. And in the Mexican context, it has been dismissed as academic hairsplitting: The barriers scheduled for lowering, it is said, are simply not high enough to divert much trade.
But if that is indeed the case, Mr. Bhagwati wonders, why make a fuss about lowering the barriers a bit more? One answer is that the deal is more a symbol of solidarity with Mexico's President Carlos Salinas de Gortari than an economic imperative. President Salinas, it is argued, is opening Mexico's parochial economic culture to new ideas. He deserves every bit of help he can get.
But Mr. Bhagwati has a less attractive view on the symbolic consequences of blurring the distinction between the creation of a regional common market in the Americas and continuing efforts to liberalize global trading.
To build a winning coalition for the Mexican agreement, the Bush Administration accepted the premise that everything from air quality in Mexican cities to working conditions in Mexican factories were grist for bilateral negotiations. Such interference makes sense if the long-term goal is creating a single economy, Mr. Bhagwati acknowledges. But making economic harmonization a precondition of liberalized trade with one country would be a dangerous precedent for the more important Uruguay Round world trade negotiations.
As a practical matter, giving environmentalists or workplace safety advocates seats at the table would make it more difficult to cut a deal acceptable to dozens of countries. But Mr. Bhagwati's objections go beyond the mechanics of negotiation: Economic diversity, he argues, is the force that drives mutually beneficial trade. Eliminate the diversity, and the gains from trade diminish.
Diversity is a slippery notion. Someone, after all, must draw the line between, say, the outrage of slave labor and the disappointing failure to encourage collective bargaining. Someone must distinguish between the wholesale slaughter of elephants and timber policies that endanger a species of owl.
But no matter where one comes out, Mr. Bhagwati has a point. If free trade with Mexico means a lot more commerce, trade diversion ought to be taken seriously. If the gains are largely symbolic, the President may have a tough time explaining why the Mexican negotiations should not be a precedent for global talks.

HEADLINE: CONGRESS PANELS VOTE TO ADVANCE FREE-TRADE PLAN

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 14

 BODY:
House and Senate committees voted overwhelmingly today to endorse negotiations for a free-trade agreement with Mexico and a new round of lowering of international trade barriers, opening the way for passage by both houses before the end of next week.
Members of Congress on both sides of the issue described the Administration's authority to negotiate trade agreements as probably the most important and contentious economic problem facing policy makers this year. 
 Appearances by Administration officials across the country have been picketed by union and environmental advocates opposed mainly to the free-trade agreement with Mexico. But today's votes gave the Administration unexpectedly wide margins, making passage very likely, although not guaranteed. The House Ways and Means Committee voted 27 to 9, and the Senate Finance Committee voted 15 to 3.
 
Pressure by White House
 The Administration had arranged hundreds of interviews for the President and his top aides to meet members of Congress, and had sent groups of Cabinet officials to appear before several Congressional hearings each day in seeking renewal of the President's "fast track authority," which expires on June 1.
Today's votes supported the Administration by rejecting resolutions to cancel the President's fast-track authority to negotiate trade agreements over the next two years and submit each agreement to a single vote in Congress with no amendments allowed. If neither chamber of Congress passes such a resolution by end of this month, the fast-track authority is renewed automatically.
One factor that helped the Administration today is that fast-track authority calls for the Administration to consult extensively with members of both committees before submitting any trade agreement to Congress. But given the continuous rivalry among House and Senate committees, some lawmakers who are not on those committees may be less enthusiastic about renewing the authority.
Nevertheless, support for renewing the Administration's fast-track authority has broadened considerably in the last two weeks for other reasons, as well. One is the continued wide acceptance of free-trade principles among economists and other intellectuals, which has put constant pressure on opponents of the negotiating authority.
"You're almost unpatriotic," said Representative Byron L. Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota, an opponent. "You're not looking out for this country's interest, it's almost a shameful thing to be labeled a protectionist."
Also, Democrats grew worried about offending the fast-growing Hispanic vote, particularly in border states where trade with Mexico is important, The Administration has tried to exploit that issue. And after a slow start, corporations that depend on exports organized a lobbying blitz to counter a similar effort that organized labor began late last year.
On the other side, unions and environmental groups have argued that an agreement with Mexico might result in many United States companies moving their factories south of the border to take advantage of lower wages and less vigorous enforcement of environmental protection statutes. Textile interests have opposed fast-track authority because negotiations on international reductions in trade barriers have led to a tentative agreement eliminating many United States restrictions on textile imports.
The Administration has contended that free trade will allow the continued expansion of American exports, which accounted for five-sixths of last year's growth in the United States economy.
Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said President Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico was committed to closer ties with the United States, "That's an opportunity we must seize," he said. "If we don't, we'll regret it well into the next century."
The margins in today's committee votes were "pretty solid," said Victoria Clarke, a spokeswoman for the United States trade representative, Carla A. Hills, whose office negotiates trade accords. But Administration officials will maintain their intensive effort to win Congressional support, she added.
 
Floor Vote Cited
 Rex Hardesty, a spokesman for the A.F.L.-C.I.O., contended that the committee votes were relatively meaningless. "It's what comes next on the floor of either chamber that really matters," he said.
Indeed, Representatives and Senators who do not belong to these committees are jealous of the special role of the panels, and may vote against fast-track authority on the floor of both houses, Administration officials and their allies in Congress conceded.
A vote in the committee for fast-track authority "protects the jurisdictional exclusivity of the Finance Committee," said Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr., Democrat of Michigan, who cast one of the three votes against fast-track authority in the finance committee.
Senator Riegle, who represents a state in which the United Automobile Workers have rallied strong opposition to a trade agreement with Mexico, has contended that Congress should retain the right to amend a free-trade agreement with Mexico in five key areas. they are labor standards, environmental protection, assistance for displaced workers, the resolution of transborder disputes and provisions to prevent third countries from evading United States import duties by shipping goods through Mexico.
 
Full Debate Backed
 The Senate majority leader, George J. Mitchell, Democrat of Maine, introduced a new element of uncertainty into the legislative future of the issue today when he indicated an interest in allowing Senator Riegle to present his proposal for debate on the floor of the full Senate.
The Administration won over several key legislators by staging a tactical retreat two weeks ago. After insisting repeatedly that any conditions for the renewal of fast-track authority would tie the hands of United States negotiators, the Administration announced on May 1 that it would pursue certain goals in talks with Mexico.
President Bush said in a letter then that the Administration would seek cooperation in improving the environment along the border and would provide some assistance to workers displaced by a trade agreement. Several key legislators, notably the House majority leader, Representative Richard A. Gephardt, Democrat of Missouri, have since lent their support to the renewal of fast-track authority.
 
Slurs Are Charged
 Issues of racism have given a bitter tinge in the last few days to the debate. In a speech on Sunday, the President criticized the use of slurs against Mexicans. At a U.A.W. rally protesting the agreement in Cleveland early last week, the hall was decorated with a large banner showing President Bush in a sombrero and other traditional Mexican garb. "Put Bush on the fast track -- to Mexico," the banner said.
Two New York Democrats on the Ways and Means Committee, Representatives Thomas J. Downey and Charles B. Rangel, criticized the President's remarks today as inappropriately highlighting racial issues. Representative Gephardt made a similar complaint on Monday.
After voting down the resolution to cancel the President's fast-track authority, the House Ways and Means Committee passed on a voice vote a resolution calling on the Administration to consult with Congress during the negotiations and to follow the negotiation plan it presented on May 1. Representative Gephardt and Representative Dan Rostenkowski, Democrat of Illinois and chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, co-sponsored the resolution, which is widely perceived as a sop to organized labor.

HEADLINE: Retail Sales Data Viewed as Sign That Economic Decline Is Halting

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 14

 BODY:
Evidence mounted today that the economy has halted its slide and that the improvement already under way in housing may have begun to spread.
The Government revised its retail sales figures for March to show a rise of four-tenths of 1 percent instead of an eight-tenths drop and it said sales essentially held this gain in April. 
 "It certainly is going in the direction of an upturn," said Rosanne M. Cahn, an economist at the First Boston Corporation, citing recent increases in industrial production, consumer sentiment and corporate purchasing as well as housing. "Perhaps the economy bottomed in April, but, if not, it will probably be May or June."
The relative strength in retail sales disclosed today by the Commerce Department appeared to touch off declines in both the bond and stock markets, reflecting diminished chances that the Federal Reserve will need to cut interest rates again to arrest the economic decline and spur a recovery. Stocks, which have been anticipating a recovery since early in the year, are now taking their cue from interest rates. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 37.57 points to end at 2,886.85.
Some analysts, however, contended that today's bond market selloff was more the result of excess supplies of bonds than fears of an economic rebound that might heat up inflation.
The Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee, its chief policy-setting body, met privately today to fix the course of monetary policy for the next seven weeks. It did so against the background of a separate report today showing that consumer prices rose a modest two-tenths of 1 percent in April, both over all and excluding the frequently wide-swinging food and energy components. [Page D6.]
The inflation figures suggested that the Fed had some maneuvering room if it wanted to push rates down, but the figures on retail sales, which account for one-third of all economic activity, suggested the economy was pulling out of the recession without the need for more rate cuts.
On the other hand, another report today showed that the sales of North American-made cars and trucks during the first 10 days of May fell 18.3 percent from levels a year earlier as the automobile industry continued to see only sporadic signs of a turnaround.
Some of the forces currently weighing on the auto sector seem likely to hold back the recovery, which nearly all analysts -- whether they expect the recession to end in the spring, summer or even later -- believe will be far less robust than has typified postwar contractions. Among other things, debts are burdensome, baby-boom spenders are entering middle age and incomes are squeezed.
 
Sales at $151.5 Billion
 Nonetheless, the retail report showed that sales in April totaled $151.5 billion, only a slight one-tenth of 1 percent below the $151.7 billion to which March was raised from an initial estimate of $149.6 billion. Sales for February were also lifted by a revision, to $151.1 billion from $150.8 billion.
Excluding the automotive sector, which showed a small upturn in the April report, sales last month were down two-tenths of 1 percent, while March sales were unchanged after being estimated initially at a decline of eight-tenths.
Sales of durable goods, those expected to last a minimum of three years, climbed six-tenths of 1 percent last month, paced by items related to housing. Merchants selling building materials, hardware, garden supplies and mobile homes posted a 3.5 percent gain and those selling furniture and other home equipment showed an increase of 1.8 percent.
The increase for automotive dealers was three-tenths of 1 percent. That is less than the 1.8 percent jump now reported for March, but much better than the drop of nine-tenths of a percent originally reported for that month.
Sales of nondurables, however, fell five-tenths of 1 percent, roughly offsetting the advance in durable goods. Most of this drop reflected a 1 percent decline for food stores and a 2.8 percent fall at gasoline service stations.
 
'Trading Down' Seen
 A Commerce Department analyst could not account for the lower food and gasoline sales but speculated that some of the decline might reflect consumers "trading down" during the recession by buying, say, cheaper cuts of meat or lower-octane gasoline. The Labor Department's report showed gasoline prices rose slightly last month.
Adding to the mystery was the fact that food-store sales in April were 1.4 percent above those of April 1990, down sharply from a 3.4 percent year-over-year increase in March.
Sales at drugstores eased three-tenths of 1 percent but there were gains of 2.1 percent at stores selling apparel and accessories and five-tenths at eating and drinking establishments. Stores selling general merchandise showed no change from March levels.
 
Revision Broadly Based
 The upward revision for March was broadly based, with durable goods now showing a 1.3 percent gain for the month instead of a nine-tenths of 1 percent decline and nondurables, a one-tenth drop instead of eight-tenths.
For February through April, sales were 1.1 percent higher than in the comparable 1990 period, but this does not allow for inflation that raised prices 4.9 percent over the last 12 months.
The upward revisions for February and March will also affect the gross national product, which was estimated last month to have fallen at a rate of 2.8 percent in the first quarter. According to Kathleen M. Camilli, an economist at Maria Ramirez Capital Consultants, the G.N.P. is now likely to be down only about half as much.
In a report related to the Consumer Price Index, the Labor Department calculated today that real average weekly earnings fell one-tenth of 1 percent in April as declines in hours worked and increases in prices were not fully offset by an increase in average hourly earnings.

HEADLINE: First Capital Unit Seized In California

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 14

 BODY:
State regulators today seized the California insurance subsidiary of the First Capital Holdings Corporation after an attempt by Citibank, the troubled company's main lender, to force it into involuntary bankruptcy.
The California Insurance Commissioner, John Garamendi, said he had taken the action to keep Citibank's claim from endangering the ability of the subsidiary, the First Capital Life Insurance Company, to pay policyholders. First Capital Holdings and its insurance units have been stung in recent months by defaults in their portfolios of "junk bonds" and by consumers' fears about the insurers' ability to honor their commitments. 
 Mr. Garamendi had put First Capital Life under harsh operating restrictions last week after a wave of requests by customers to cash in policies. On Monday, regulators in Virginia seized First Capital Holdings' other subsidiary, the Fidelity Bankers Life Insurance Company, after a similar surge in policy surrenders.
Citibank is the lead bank in a syndicate that lent $275 million to First Capital Holdings. It filed a petition with the Federal Bankruptcy Court in Los Angeles late Monday seeking to have First Capital Holdings placed under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code. Under Chapter 11, a company operates under court supervision and is shielded from claims while it develops a plan to pay creditors. The petition could be opposed by the company and has not been acted on by the court.
Citibank said in a statement that it took the action along with other lenders "in an attempt to protect the bank group's rights." By trying to force First Capital Holdings into bankruptcy, the bank hoped to bolster its claim for repayment.
First Capital Holdings said in a statement that it was "now considering all of its options," but would not elaborate.
At a news conference in Sacramento, Mr. Garamendi said he seized the insurer "to protect the assets of First Capital Life and the savings and benefits of hundreds of thousands of policyholders from being ensnared in Citibank's attempt to place First Capital Holdings in involuntary bankruptcy."
First Capital Life has assets of $4.5 billion. It has 190,000 life insurance policyholders and 62,000 annuity holders in 49 states. Fidelity Bankers has $4.1 billion in assets, 213,000 life insurance policyholders and 97,000 annuity holders nationwide.
 
Insurer 'Walled Off'
 In a telephone interview, Mr. Garamendi said the bankruptcy petition "required us to wall off the insurance company from the holding company."
First Capital Life will continue to pay all death benefits and other policy claims and will make regular payments to annuity holders, Mr. Garamendi said. The freeze on policy surrenders imposed last week will remain in effect, he said.
Mr. Garamendi said negotiations were continuing with the American Express Company and its Shearson Lehman brokerage subsidiary on a plan to restore First Capital to health. Shearson owns a 28 percent stake in First Capital Holdings and sold many First Capital Life policies to its customers. Mr. Garamendi said the negotiations also included Citibank.
 
Shearson Resists Demands
 Shearson said last week that it would take a $144 million charge to write off its investment in First Capital Holdings. Shearson and American Express have so far resisted Mr. Garamendi's demands that they help to bail out First Capital Life.
Mr. Garamendi said today that American Express and Shearson "have been very cooperative in the process of restructuring the financial foundation" of First Capital Life. But he said they may not inject additional capital into the insurer as part of the restructuring.
People who have been briefed on the discussions said Shearson had proposed alternative plans to replace two that Mr. Garamendi rejected last week. But those plans were said to be intended only to protect Shearson customers, a fact that led to the rejection of the original initiatives.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
First Executive Filing
 LOS ANGELES, May 14 (Reuters) -- The First Executive Corporation, the insurance holding company whose operations were seized by state regulators last month, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
The company announced the filing late Monday, but gave no details. The papers were filed with the Federal Bankruptcy Court in Los Angeles.
On April 11, California's Insurance Commissioner put the Executive Life Insurance Company under control of an outside conservator, hoping to fashion a rescue plan for the unit, which has assets of $10.2 billion. New York State regulators, meanwhile, seized another First Executive unit, the Executive Life Insurance Company of New York.
The failure of the insurance subsidiaries was the biggest in United States history.
The bankruptcy filing by the parent will have no effect on policyholders of either unit. The financial ties between First Executive and the operating units have been frozen under the seizures.
First Executive had suffered huge losses on its "junk bond" holdings, weakening its financial condition. The company was a large customer of Drexel Burnham Lambert, the investment firm that was forced into liquidation by legal problems surrounding its junk bond activities.
First Executive lost $466 million in the fourth quarter, largely because of junk bond defaults. As the economy soared in the 1980's, insurance companies and other investors took on the high-yielding bonds, which in previous decades had largely been shunned by mainstream investors as too risky.
Executive Life of California had $6.4 billion in junk bonds out of total assets of $10.1 billion.
Separately, the California Insurance Department said it would soon begin a competitive bidding process for the sale of Executive Life. John Garamendi, the insurance commissioner, said he had authorized the Blackstone Group, a New York investment bank, to begin contacting prospective buyers.
The most likely buyer continues to be a European consortium headed by Altus Finance, an arm of Credit Lyonnais, a French banking company. Mr. Garamendi said negotiations with Altus were proceeding and that the consortium had agreed to provide at leat $3 billion in new financing should a deal be completed.
Mr. Garamendi said any deal with Altus would include a "restructuring of liabilities," presumably meaning a cut in the rate paid to holders of Executive Life annuities and other investment agreements.

HEADLINE: Icahn Sale Of USX Stock Seen

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
Carl C. Icahn apparently sold his entire stake in the USX Corporation yesterday for more than $1 billion and a profit of about $200 million.
The sale, in what may have been a move to assist his ailing Trans World Airlines, ends an often stormy relationship between the New York-based takeover strategist and the Pittsburgh-based energy and steel company. It comes a week after USX shareholders agreed to split the company's stock into two classes to reflect the separate values of the energy and steel business, something Mr. Icahn had urged for years. 
 Yesterday blocks of stock representing 13.3 percent of each issue were sold on the New York Stock Exchange. Mr. Icahn did not respond to calls to his office, but news agencies quoted USX spokesmen as saying he was almost certainly the seller since no one else held so many shares.
 
Proceeds May Aid Airline
 Meanwhile, T.W.A., where he is chairman and chief executive, has been pinched by a decline in air traffic and higher fuel prices and has announced its intention to restructure its finances. Some of Mr. Icahn's investment in USX was done through T.W.A., so some of the proceeds may be used to help the cash-short carrier.
Mr. Icahn has been accused by T.W.A.'s unions of not investing enough in the airline to make it competitive under current conditions.
Because of Mr. Icahn's pressure, USX stock now trades as USX-Marathon and USX-U.S. Steel. Brokers bought and then resold 33.9 million shares of USX-Marathon and nearly 6.8 million shares of USX-Steel, both at $25 a share, for just over $1 billion in proceeds.
 
Paid About $800 Million
 Since he is believed to have paid about $800 million for the shares, he apparently recorded a profit of $200 million before interest and other costs.
The Marathon shares declined by $1.125 yesterday, to $25.125, while the Steel shares fell 75 cents, to $25. Marathon was the most active stock of the day while Steel was the third most active.
Analysts said the sale was not surprising in light of an agreement Mr. Icahn had made with the company not to acquire any more shares for seven years. They added that there was little he could do to lift the prices of the stock.
"People were waiting for him to sell his position," Reuters quoted Richard Cohen of Baird, Patrick as saying. "He was not going to do anything to add value at this point."
Mr. Icahn has long argued that USX's steel business has dragged down the performance of its energy operations, which includes the Marathon Oil Company, and held down the price of USX stock.
He began battling the company shortly after investing in its shares in 1986 and threatened a takeover effort. Rebuffed by management, he held on to his shares but took little action for two years. But in 1989 he bought more USX stock and again pressed management to restructure.
Last year, Mr. Icahn threatened a proxy fight to win control of the board. He dropped that effort when management agreed to submit to shareholders a nonbinding plan to spin off 80 percent of U.S. Steel and pay a special dividend with the proceeds.
The measure lost, but the 43 percent of the vote won by Mr. Icahn put pressure on management to do some form of reshuffle. Early this year the company announced that it would issue a new series of stock representing the steel business.
USX officials have said recently that they have held informal talks about selling the steel units, but that no deals are close.
If the steel unit is sold it would be the ultimate breakup for a company that was founded in 1901 by the combination of an Andrew Carnegie steel company and J. P. Morgan's steel holding and was known until 1986 as the United States Steel Corporation. It remains the nation's largest maker of steel, but has had trouble making money in the steel business.
Last month the company reported a net loss of $237 million in the first quarter, primarily as a result of a recession-dampened demand for steel and the cost of closing steel plants. Steel sales in the period were down 27 percent, to $943 million.
Meanwhile, the energy side of the company reported an operating income of $229 million, down only slightly from the previous year.

HEADLINE: House Panel Bars Proposal To Limit Deposit Insurance

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 14

 BODY:
The Bush Administration's attempt to rewrite the banking laws suffered a political setback today when a House panel rejected its proposals to limit coverage of deposit insurance.
A House banking subcommittee removed from the Treasury Department's legislation a provision that would have restricted deposit insurance coverage to $200,000 per individual per bank. 
 The subcommittee also voted against attempts supported by the Treasury to eliminate insurance coverage of some types of deferred compensation plans and of brokered deposits sold by investment houses to investors seeking high interest rates.
The votes came on the first day that Congress began formally considering the Administration's plan to restructure the banking industry by limiting deposit insurance and expanding the ability of banks to enter into new businesses.
Today's votes do not kill the Administration's proposal because once a banking package is approved by the subcommittee it must still go to the full banking committee, where it can be amended again, before proceeding to the floor of the House. Parts of it may also be taken up by another committee, which has jurisdiction over the regulation of investment banks; under the Treasury proposal, investment banks would be permitted to merge with commercial banks.
The Senate Banking Committee is expected to begin drafting banking legislation this summer but it has not set a date yet.
Even though the rejected measures in the Administration's proposal could yet be revived, the votes today by the House Banking Committee's Subcommittee on Financial Institutions Supervision, Regulation and Insurance provided the first indication that Congress may not be willing to substantially reduce deposit insurance protection, a key component of the Administration's plan to repair the banking industry. Thirty-six of the 52 members of the banking committee serve on the subcommittee that rejected the Administration's proposals today.
Subcommittee members said the legislation being crafted was clearly bearing more of a mark of banking groups and other interested lobbyists than of the Bush Administration.
"Treasury has been out-lobbied by the banking industry," said Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, after the daylong subcommittee voting.
Representative Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of Brooklyn and another member of the subcommittee, who has been courted by the Administration to lend support to its legislation, called the day's action "hardly an irremediable setback, but a setback nonetheless."
"The consensus that is emerging is to not limit deposit insurance, but to limit bank powers," Mr. Schumer said. "The Administration is going to have to come in and offer some compromises."
By a vote of 18 to 17, the subcommittee adopted a provision that basically retains the present insurance coverage for individuals. Although the coverage now technically only protects a depositor for up to $100,000, the law also permits families to open up multiple joint accounts, which effectively extends coverage.
The Administration had proposed limiting coverage to $100,000, plus retirement savings of $100,000, per depositor per institution in an attempt to eliminate the extra protection afforded through the use of multiple accounts. The federally backed fund that insures deposits is at its lowest level since its creation and, by some estimates, could become insolvent within the next year or two.
The Treasury proposal was already watered down from an original plan supported by some senior Administration officials to limit coverage to $100,000 systemwide. Instead, the Treasury proposal recommended that an individual with more than $100,000 be permitted to obtain complete insurance protection by opening accounts at more than one bank.
The vote followed a well-orchestrated campaign led by the Independent Bankers Association of America, a trade group representing small and middle-sized banks that fear any limitations could lead to heavy withdrawals from depositors.
The Independent Bankers Association enlisted the support of 23 other lobbying groups, from home builders and the National Farmers Union to the American Association of Retired Persons, in its attempt to maintain existing coverage.
The subcommittee also decided by voice vote today to permit the stronger banks to continue to provide deposit insurance for brokered deposits. Such deposits, which include certificates of deposit, are sold to investors by investment firms that often move them around the nation in search of the highest available interest rates. The Treasury Department had proposed eliminating insurance coverage for brokered deposits, a recommendation that has precipitated an intense lobbying campaign by the large Wall Street firms that sell such deposits, notably Merrill Lynch.
 
Deferred Compensation Plans
 By a vote of 22 to 14, the subcommittee decided to reject the Administration's recommendation on insurance coverage of deferred compensation plans structured under section 457 of the Federal income tax code.
The Treasury's only major victory of the day came when the subcommittee by voice vote rejected an attempt to retain the existing law that protects deposits in so-called pass-through accounts, typically pension plans that break down their funds to receive insurance coverage.
The initial test for most of the Administration's other significant recommendations to change the banking landscape will begin later this week or next week, when the subcommittee begins examining the Treasury's proposals to expand the power of banks to enter new fields of business and eliminate barriers that now restrict banks from opening branches across state lines. Many of these changes are also opposed by the coalition formed by the Independent Bankers Association.
Last week the subcommittee approved a measure to increase to $30 billion from $5 billion the authority of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to borrow from the Treasury.

HEADLINE: New York Is Pressed to Pare Welfare as Home-Relief Rolls Grow

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, May 14

 BODY:
As the recession robs hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers of work, the state's welfare program for the employable poor is growing at an astounding rate.
But paradoxically, the immense growth in the cost of the home-relief program is creating political pressure to shrink the state's social safety net precisely when it is most needed to break the fall of the recently unemployed. 
 The need to make cuts in the $2 billion program stems largely from the struggle to fill a state budget gap that is estimated at more than $6 billion by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo.
The movement has been reinforced by the fact that New York spends more per person on the program than any other state and by the traditional perception of home relief as a dole for those who prefer a life of dependency to a life of work.
 
Fruitless Search for Work
 But the stereotype of the able-bodied malingerer does not fit many of the new home-relief applicants at the Soundview Income Maintenance Center, at 1365 Jerome Avenue in the South Bronx.
They are men like Christopher Askew, a 38-year-old laborer who has spent his life flinging newspapers, shining shoes, loading boxcars and, most recently, operating a jackhammer. After being laid off from his construction job in July, and spending 10 months in a fruitless search for work, Mr. Askew applied for home relief for the first time in late April.
"I'm behind in my rent since November, and they're threatening to toss me out," said Mr. Askew, whose unemployment benefits ran out in January. "Working is all I know. But now I sit around and can't feed my family."
New York, unlike many states, provides welfare support not only to mothers with dependent children and the handicapped, but also has home relief, a general welfare program that provides a monthly grant and Medicaid coverage to able-bodied people who cannot find work and those who are too ill, addicted or incapacitated to hold a job.
For a person with no income in New York City, the home-relief grant is $352 a month, an amount that leaves the recipient living far below the poverty level and sometimes without shelter.
But in Albany, where the program has become the fastest growing component of the state's $5.7 billion welfare system, home relief is viewed as the most conspicuous symbol of the state's growing inability to provide for its poor.
Between January 1989 and January 1991, the number of home-relief recipients in New York grew by 38 percent, to 315,000 from 229,000. In 1990 the average monthly expenditure on home relief, including the cost of welfare grants and Medicaid, rose by 28 percent over the previous year, to $168 million from $131 million. The cost is split by the state and local governments, with no Federal assistance.
As in other states, most of the growth in the home-relief caseload has been among those who were considered employable, and the growth generally has followed increases in unemployment. In New York, the number of employable home-relief recipients grew by 51 percent between January 1989 and January 1991, a period when the jobless rate rose to 7.1 percent from 5.6 percent and when the number of people who exhausted their unemployment benefits increased by 42 percent to almost 217,000.
By contrast, the caseload for the Aid to Families With Dependent Children program, which has only a marginal connection to the job market, grew by 6 percent in the same period, to slightly more than one million.
While the Federal Government requires that welfare benefits be paid to the elderly, the disabled and poor mothers with children, New York is one of only 13 states that chooses to finance welfare for the employable poor.
Governors in many of those states, including California, Ohio and Illinois, have proposed deep cuts in their versions of home relief. The proposals are rooted in a philosophy of welfare triage, in which programs that provide benefits for children and the disabled are being salvaged by sacrificing those that assist employable adults.
Home relief has long been susceptible to political attack because it is financed without help from Washington, unlike Aid to Families with Dependent Children, the primary welfare program for poor mothers and children. But the growing caseload and cost, which now accounts for one of every $29 in New York State's general fund budget, is posing the most severe threat to the program since its creation in 1931 by Gov. Franklin D. Roosevelt.
The Republicans who control the State Senate have proposed a broad array of cuts. Among the most severe would be a 90-day limit on benefits for employable recipients and requirements that recipients pay premiums for their Medicaid coverage and a fee of up to $3 for each doctor visit.
"We have a limited pot of dollars and we've said that our priorities will be mothers and children," said Paul F. Macielak, counsel to the Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino.
Supporters of home relief fear that the need to fill a $6 billion budget gap will weaken resistance to the cuts in the Assembly. But Assembly officials vow that the Democratic majority in that house will maintain its traditional protection of the program. Seventy-one percent of the home-relief caseload, and 81 percent of the growth in the caseload in the last two years, comes from New York City, the power base of the Assembly Democrats.
Welfare advocates are also discouraged that Governor Cuomo has shown a willingness in the last two years to scale back the program. Last year, Mr. Cuomo proposed a six-month limit on benefits for employable home-relief recipients. The proposal died in the Legislature last year and the Governor killed it this year in response to the deteriorating economy.
Although the Cuomo administration wants to protect home relief from major cuts, it hopes to glean savings from more modest eligibility restrictions. It has also been forced to suggest innovative measures to fend off Republican attacks.
Last month, the State Social Services Commissioner, Cesar A. Perales, suggested that the home-relief grant could be used to subsidize salaries paid by employers willing to create new jobs for welfare recipients.
Advocates for the poor argue that the Senate proposals will ultimately drive up social-services costs for the state and local governments. It would be "penny wise and pound foolish" to scale back home relief, said Pablo Ruiz Salomon, an analyst with the Community Service Society of New York.
"Where do you think these people are going to go?" he said. "They're going to go to the Health and Hospitals Corporation if they don't have Medicaid. They're going to go to the shelter system if they don't have a grant." At $1,215 a month, the cost of housing a person in a New York City homeless shelter is more than three times the cost of the home-relief grant in the city.
The chairman of the Senate Social Services Committee, Joseph R. Holland, Republican of Rockland County, said his party viewed home relief as a major contributor to the problem of welfare dependency.
 
Stereotypes as Drawbacks
 "If people have a real problem, whether it's drugs, alcohol, mental or physical, we don't think the public minds taking care of them," Mr. Holland said. "But if they're physically able and are unused to working or don't work, we want them to struggle, just like I would want my kids to do."
State social services officials and advocates for the poor concede that the program is stigmatized by a pervasive stereotype.
"In the rural areas, it's the guy sitting on a porch swigging a beer and tossing the cans into the backyard and watching them pile up," said Mr. Perales, the State Social Services Commissioner. "In the city, it's the young men hanging around fires in barrels. There's a sense that these people just don't like to work, that they're lazy."
Like most stereotypes, Mr. Perales said, that profile of home relief is based on a nugget of truth that obscures a greater reality. Few legislators, he maintains, realize that half of all home-relief recipients are women and that only 23 percent are men under the age of 40. He also pointed out that almost 60 percent of the growth in the home relief population in the last two years has been composed of families. Benefits increase depending on the number of people in a family.
"It's a potpourri, without a doubt, and you have a percentage of the population that justifiably inspires people's anger," said Russell Sykes, a policy analyst with the State Communities Aid Association. "But policy should not be made for a larger group based on the perception about a minority."
For the victims of the recession who are making their first trips to Soundview's drab waiting rooms, the fear that their safety net may soon shrink is particularly disheartening.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR;
U.N. Plan Could Have Iraq Yield 25% of Oil Revenue

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, May 14

 BODY:
The United States and the four other permanent members of the Security Council have drawn up a plan under which Iraq could be compelled to pay 25 to 30 percent of its $20 billion annual oil revenue as reparations for the invasion and looting of Kuwait and as repayment of its debts to foreign governments.
Such a limit on reparations would mean that the most Iraq could be asked to pay in any year would be roughly equivalent to the $5 billion or so it spent annually buying foreign weapons before the Persian Gulf war. And the Security Council might set the payment at a lower level than the maximum. The total reparations to be demanded of Iraq could run as high as $50 billion. 
 A major question is when the Baghdad Government will be permitted to resume selling its oil on the world market. This is dependent on Iraq's compliance with previous orders to turn over and destroy its missiles and chemical weapons, and submit its nuclear material to inspection.
 
Approval Thought Likely
 The proposal on reparations, which has the backing of Britain, France, the Soviet Union and China as well as the United States -- is expected to be adopted by the entire Council later this week without major changes, diplomats say.
The proposal itself does not set any figures for the level of Iraqi payments, saying it is up to the United Nations Secretary General, Javier Perez de Cuellar, to propose a maximum figure to the Council for approval.
Despite the wide expectation of a 25 to 30 percent ceiling, the American Assistant Secretary of State in charge of United Nations affairs, John R. Bolton, recently proposed a ceiling up to 50 percent of Iraq's oil revenue. Other permanent members of the Council, the five nations with veto power, regard this as unrealistic.
 
Way of Increasing Oil Flow
 Some countries friendly to Iraq have suggested that the Government of President Saddam Hussein be asked to allocate no more than 10 percent of its oil revenue for reparations.
Earlier, Iraq had asked for a five-year delay on reparations payments to allow it to rebuild its shattered economy.
The purpose of establishing an annual ceiling on payments, diplomats say, is to encourage Baghdad to produce maximum quantities of oil after sanctions are lifted by insuring that it will always get a portion of any increase in its market share.
In calling for a ceiling, diplomats say the Council also wanted to avoid a disastrous mistake like the Treaty of Versailles of 1919, when the victorious Allies imposed draconian compensation payments on a defeated Germany, threatening it with impoverishment and contributing to the rise of Nazism.
Under previous resolutions, the Security Council has declared Baghdad liable for "any direct loss, damage, including environmental damage and the depletion of natural resources, or injury to foreign governments, nationals and corporations as a result of Iraq's unlawful invasion and occupation of Kuwait."
 
How Iraqis Can Help Themselves
 Diplomats say the payment level demanded may also be influenced by political factors, like the composition of the government in power in Baghdad, and by Saudi Arabia's and Kuwait's demands for repayment of the roughly $50 billion they are believed to have lent Iraq during its eight-year war against Iran.
If Mr. Hussein's Government falls and is replaced by a more acceptable leadership, these diplomats believe that Kuwait and other gulf nations would urge the Council to treat Iraq more leniently and offer to forgive some debts. Iraq also owes $25 billion to the Western industrial nations and the Soviet Union.
In deciding how much Iraq should pay in reparations, the Security Council, working through a new subsidiary to be called the United Nations Compensation Fund, is required to take into account the cost of repaying its foreign debts as well as its economic-development needs.
Security Council approval of the proposed resolution setting up the reparations-payment mechanism fulfills one of two conditions the Council has established for lifting its worldwide ban on the Iraqi oil trade.
The other condition will be met when the Council is satisfied that Iraq has complied with a plan the Secretary General will present on May 18 -- for a special commission to take possession of Iraq's chemical and other weapons of mass destruction within 45 days and start destroying them.

HEADLINE: Wine Talk

BYLINE: By Frank J. Prial

 BODY:
WINE people, people who make a living from it, that is, can make somber companions these days. They sigh, they shrug their shoulders and the roll their eyes. Can't blame them. The recession and the strong wave of anti-alcohol sentiment in the United States have combined to deliver the trade a one-two punch. Not fatal, but not pleasant, either.
Which is why it is pleasant to run into someone like Jeff Prather, wine director at Ray's Boathouse, a popular restaurant in Seattle. Unlike many others in the industry, Mr. Prather is optimistic about the future of wine, and is doing something about it. 
 Restaurants are the front line of wine appreciation. People who would never dream of drinking wine at home drink it in restaurants. And unless their parents were wine drinkers, most people who do drink wine at home first tasted it in restaurants.
The restaurant is wine's natural habitat because in a restaurant, wine is invariably paired with food. And let's face it, without food, most wine doesn't make sense. Which is where Mr. Prather comes in.
Most restaurants' wine lists group wines by country -- all the French wines in one section, all the Americans in another -- or by variety -- cabernets here, chardonnays there. Mr. Prather groups wines that might go well with certain foods: four reds that go with steak and chops, or five whites that go with lighter fish.
Mr. Prather talked about his system the other day in New York, where he was visiting Windows on the World, interestingly one of the first major restaurants to promote wine as an integral part of a meal.
Most people don't know the difference between a sauvignon blanc and a chenin blanc. Or a cabernet and a merlot, a barbera and a barbaresco, a pouilly fume and a pouilly fuisse. So why, if they are ready to order wine with their dinner, should they be penalized for not being wine experts?
Like many ambitious wine managers, Mr. Prather offers wine courses at Ray's and at a newer restaurant in the Seattle area, the Yarrow Bay Grill. Courses are excellent for people interested in them, but it should not be necessary to take a course to enjoy wine in a restaurant. Or anywhere else.
The Ray's Boathouse wine list sees to that. The restaurant's main list includes more than 700 items. Recently, Mr. Prather devised a short list, called Ray's Recommends. It lists a few sparkling wines and six categories based on food: whites to go with oysters and shellfish; whites for light fish; richer selections for salmon and such; Boathouse blush, roses; red wines that can go with fish, and meaty reds, for people who persist in eating steak in fish restaurants.
The 27-wine short list is overwhelmingly American, but it includes a few French wines. The seven wines recommended for oysters and shellfish, for example, are three sauvignon blancs -- Ray's private label, from Washington ($13); a Paul Thomas, also from Washington ($16); and a Groth, from Napa Valley ($15) -- a Snoqualmie semillon, from Washington ($13); an Eyrie pinot gris, from Oregon ($17); a grand cru Chablis, Les Bougros by Joseph Drouhin, ($45), and a white Bordeaux, Chateau La Louviere, from Graves ($17).
With light fish, Mr. Prather recommends several Washington rieslings, a Washington chenin blanc and an Oregon gewurztraminer, all of which are dry, he said. With salmon, he wisely suggests chardonnay. Salmon and lobster are two of the few seafoods that can stand up to chardonnay; the wine is too alcoholic and has too pronounced a flavor for most species. The Drouhin Chablis is 100 percent chardonnay, but without the heaviness and the over-oaked taste of so many American chardonnays.
In recommending some reds to go with fish, Mr. Prather is following Bordeaux tradition. The Bordelais find themselves in a peculiar position: they make some of the great red wines of the world, much of it a stone's throw from the ocean and some very fine fish. Of course, they match them up. Not always, but often.
If the fish -- salmon or bluefish, say -- is not delicate and the wine is, why not. Accordingly, Mr. Prather offers two pinot noirs, a Knudsen-Erath Vintage Select from Oregon and a Saintsbury, from the Carneros region of Napa Valley, and a gamay, Georges Duboeuf's Beaujolais Villages.
This kind of wine list works two ways. Someone in the mood for chardonnay is gently steered away from fish that need a lighter wine and toward the salmon that will make a good match.
And an oyster fan, if he follows the list, will get something sharp to counter the salinity of the oyster, and not a fruity riesling or a bland chenin blanc.
For patrons who want all the work done for them, Mr. Prather and Ray's chef, Wayne Ludvigsen, put together menus of complete dinners, which they call Matchmaker.
One such menu, recently reprinted in The Restaurant Wine Newsletter, was steamed clams and mussels, and a tossed salad with Dijon mustard and Oregon blue cheese, served with a Manzanilla sherry; then grilled coho salmon, in a chanterelle and chardonnay cream sauce, with a Chalone chardonnay from California bottled for the restaurant; and dessert served with a naturally sweet, late harvest riesling from Stewart Vineyards in Washington. Price for the works: $33.
This kind of menu, including wines, remains the best way to begin learning about the subject. Nor is it an idea limited to this country. Almost every French restaurant with three stars from Michelin offers a menu degustation -- a tasting menu -- that includes wines. Many food lovers planning a dinner at, for example, Lucas-Carton in Paris, look forward to the wines the chef and owner, Alain Senderens, will pick for them, almost as much as the meal itself.
 
TASTINGS
Taylor California Cellars Diet Chablis; about $6 for a magnum.
 If ever there was a wine whose time has come, this is it. The concept is not new and the name isn't exactly felicitous. Connoisseurs are not likely to give it a second thought. But there are probably a few dozen million consumers out there who will see nothing untoward about the idea of a low-alcohol, low-calorie white wine. They, and anyone else who tries it, are in for a surprise. Diet Chablis resembles nothing so much as the fresh young wines served in the Vienna Woods in springtime and directly from the cask in the vine-covered cafes along the Rhine and Moselle: fresh, flowery and with just the right acid bite. Wine doesn't have to be high in alcohol to taste good. In Germany, light wines at 7 or 9 percent alcohol were once common, and Beaujolais at 10 percent was not unusual. Diet Chablis comes in at an astonishingly low 3.4 percent -- astonishing because it still tastes like fresh young wine. Alcohol-free wines continue to be dreadful stuff for the most part, tasting flat and bland. This is nothing like them. There is a bit of residual sugar, but not the sticky sweetness of most wine coolers. The process of making Diet Chablis involves adding grape juice to regular wine. Whatever it is, it works; this is a delightful summer drink, especially for parties and receptions, and with just 30 percent of the calories of regular wine. Widely available now, Diet Chablis should be in all large markets in a month.

Steel Stories: A U.S. Success and a Soviet Failure

BYLINE: By HERBERT MITGANG

 BODY:

American Steel
Hot Metal Men and the Resurrection of the Rust Belt
By Richard Preston
278 pages. Prentice Hall Press. $19.95.
 
Steeltown, U.S.S.R.
Soviet Society in the Gorbachev Era
By Stephen Kotkin
Illustrated. 269 pages. University of California Press. $24.95. 
 With American business on the skids and the Soviet economy on the ropes, it's enlightening to pair two books about the steel industry, which is about as basic as you can get, in each country. Reading the books side by side -- both happen to be well researched and fairly well written -- is a lesson in the larger matter of how the free market and a controlled system succeed or stumble.
"American Steel," by Richard Preston, and "Steeltown, U.S.S.R.," by Stephen Kotkin, are generally apolitical. They are mainly concerned with the efforts and shortcomings, the difficulties and the dreams of people working in a sector of the economy in tough times. Neither of these American authors has an evil empire in mind.
In the midst of all the unemployment in Midwestern industrial areas. Mr. Preston has written an upbeat story about the creation of a new steel mill in an old cornfield in Crawfordsville, Ind. (An excerpt from "American Steel" ran in The New Yorker this year.) The author observed the building of a large sheet mill by the Nucor Corporation, using German technology, from a hole in the ground to the first pouring of molten steel.
Nucor, a Fortune 500 company with manufacturing plants around the country, makes steel from melted automobiles -- literally. Right at the start, F. Kenneth Iverson, Nucor's chairman, told the author that his new plant was going to scare the big American steel companies by invading their market for flat-rolled sheet steel; furthermore, he was going to beat the Japanese steelmakers by using machinery that was more labor efficient.
"American Steel" takes the reader from the chairman's modest office down to the Hades-like heat and danger of the new steel plant. We meet a half-dozen dedicated individuals, the subtitle's "hot metal men," who love their business and find it professionally satisfying and even glamorous. Without interpretation and all too briefly, the author notes that Nucor's plants are nonunion and that Mr. Iverson is not popular with the United Steelworkers of America. He says that Nucor built mills and product factories in small rural towns among farm people who were comfortable with machinery and disliked labor organizers.
Mr. Preston uses dramatic terms that occasionally overreach when straightforward language would be less distracting and possibly more accurate. He writes that steel rushes into a mold, "which shivers around the nozzle in a sexual-industrial climax, and water jets roar inside the machine." Still, "American Steel" conveys the excitement of a comparatively small company going up against the big boys.
In the end, the new machinery and the daring hot metal men turn the self-contained plant into a pioneering enterprise: "Iverson's machine carries the river and the river shines like the sun, flowing from the mountains of the Rust Belt to the arc furnaces of Crawfordsville, down the cataracts of the casting tower, through the narrows of the rolling mill, and into the Midwest."
"Steeltown, U.S.S.R." is a more ambitious work by a Princeton historian who went to the model steel city of Magnitogorsk in the southern Urals in 1987 and became the first American to live there in 45 years. His book provides realistic insights into life and industry in the Soviet Union during the Gorbachev era. For both the people and the plant, it's a struggle for survival.
By contrast, "American Steel" illustrates that a new mill in onetime farm country in Indiana -- even though an exception to the poor conditions prevailing elsewhere in the American Rust Belt -- could become a competitor internationally. In fairness, the author points out that workers in the steel city of Gary, Ind., are also burdened with problems, including unemployment, inadequate housing and racism.
Magnitogorsk is presented as a symbol of the difficulties facing any Moscow leaders trying to improve production, let alone change to a market economy. The city was founded in 1929 as part of Stalin's forced industrialization. It was once a showcase of production and was especially effective during World War II. But built into the system was forced labor and in some cases purges and executions. One of the propaganda photographs reproduced in the book is a 1932 picture of a so-called "new man" and his wife; the author's caption says the former peasant turned literate skilled worker was arrested and shot in 1937.
The Soviet system brought certain benefits to the steel town: basic education, considered a right, was provided free; higher education, also free, afforded a chance to move up in society. But alongside these advantages, the author writes, the people still face "entrenched alcoholism, recurrent shortages of consumer goods, a severe housing crisis extending well into the future, a ubiquitous black market." From its peak as a great steel plant, Magnitogorsk became what it is today, a dinosaur spewing pollution.
"In Magnitogorsk the newspaper expertly conducted the campaign to expose the fatal flaws of the existing system but did not offer any suggestions about how to put the pieces back together again, other than to pursue the truth and to support Mikhail Gorbachev, whatever he might be up to," Mr. Kotkin writes. "Steeltown, U.S.S.R." leaves a clear impression that glasnost is working but perestroika is still hobbled by the spoor of Stalinism.

HEADLINE: FOREIGN AFFAIRS;
A Thunderclap . . .

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB

 BODY:
Secretary of State Baker has gotten no Mideast conference and no coonskin, no peace process and no one to blame. He and President Bush have squandered American prestige and power in vain attempts to squeeze micro-mini procedural concessions from the warring parties.
 To jump-start the bargaining process requires not small steps, but a clap of thunder from Mr. Bush -- the one leader to emerge from the Iraq war holding a fistful of huge i.o.u.'s and wish lists. Officials say that is just what he is thinking about.
 
 The idea is for Mr. Bush to announce the convening of a Mideast peace conference in Washington at a date soon and certain. He himself would set fair rules to govern the proceedings. And he would spell out in unmistakable terms the consequences -- realistic ones with sharp teeth -- for failing to participate.
 Mr. Baker has been slyly executing a variant of this approach for several weeks, but it was grossly misdirected at either establishing a conference or isolating Israel. The essence of the approach was to gain the agreement of key Arab states to a regional gathering and then present Prime Minister Shamir with a virtual ultimatum: Either join in or face the prospect of a Mideast peace parley with an empty seat for Israel.
 Behind that ultimatum, Mr. Baker hinted to his interlocutors, stood a second threat: If Israel refused to attend a "friendly" conference sponsored by Moscow and Washington, it might be confronted with an "unfriendly" U.N.-sponsored meeting and with sanctions against the Jewish state for not complying with U.N. resolutions.
 Syria's rejection of Mr. Baker's compromise terms for the regional conference knocked that strategy off the rails. Israel could no longer be isolated, despite the Shamir Government's intransigence.
 Administration officials are suggesting that they will turn next to a small-bore strategy, probably the old one of prompting talks between Israel and a joint Jordanian-Palestinian team to discuss the West Bank and Gaza Strip. But like past efforts, this will take many months to play out -- only to stumble eventually over tiny procedural hurdles.
 The alternative is a thunderclap proposal that Mr. Bush and Mikhail Gorbachev could package as follows:
 1. A Washington conference. The two leaders invite Israel, Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia representing the Persian Gulf states and a joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation. Without consultation, the conveners decide on the Palestinian members, while offering Israel assurances that Jerusalem cannot even be discussed until all other matters are resolved. The U.N. and the European Community are given observer status to meet Arab concerns. No party is required to accept substantive preconditions such as land for peace.
 2. Rules and procedures. These must be handed down by the conveners without negotiations.
All parties will meet for one or two days. After that and for three months, they will divide into three parts: Israel with the Jordanian-Palestinian team on the occupied territories. Syria and Israel on the Golan Heights; and Lebanon with Israel. All parties on regional arms control, economic development and water-sharing.
 After a three-month interval, the full conference will reconvene solely to hear reports and comment before the three-tiered talks are resumed.
 3. Consequences for no-shows. Mr. Bush will have to lay bare the costs of not participating. For Saudi Arabia, no U.S. arms or security blanket. For Syria, no U.S. economic support bilaterally or multilaterally plus diplomatic isolation. For Jordan, no U.S. aid. For the Palestinians, no further U.S. efforts in their behalf. For Israel, no aid for resettling Soviet immigrants and aid cuts if further Jewish settlements are erected on the West Bank.
 These measures are draconian. They have to be. Nothing less can shake up these enemies whose peoples desperately need peace to discuss peace.
 If the conference flops, the U.S. can always go back to selling more arms and making occasional diplomatic forays, and regional leaders to hating and killing. But Mr. Bush has the chance to rewrite this endless, murderous tragedy if he would pursue peace as skillfully and boldly as he waged war.

HEADLINE: Rohatyn Ties Aid to New York City To Greater Role for a State Board

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
Felix G. Rohatyn, the chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, says his agency will give New York City $1 billion over four years to avoid layoffs and service cuts if a state board's role in overseeing the city's finances is expanded.
Mr. Rohatyn has told city and state officials in the last few days that the corporation, set up to sell bonds for the city during its fiscal troubles in the 1970's, could raise the $1 billion by refinancing the city's bonds. 
 In effect, the plan would help reduce city deficits for the next four years but increase debt repayment costs in subsequent years. While the money involved is only a small portion of the $3.5 billion budget gap the city faces in the next fiscal year, it could help the city avert the worst of the $1.5 billion in cuts proposed by Mayor David N. Dinkins.
 
String Is Attached
 But according to the officials who were briefed, Mr. Rohatyn said he was prepared to raise the money only if the State Financial Control Board certifies that the Dinkins administration has a plan to achieve a permanent balance between recurring revenues and spending by 1995.
The M.A.C. money's leverage would indirectly give the Control Board new power to pressure the Mayor to reshape his spending priorities. The board was set up in 1975 to control city spending, but it officially gave up that power in 1986, when the city was in an economic boom. It now monitors the city's finances.
The new role for the board would be a challenge to Mr. Dinkins; he has made maintaining firm control over the city's finances a cornerstone of his fiscal policy and has viewed any suggestion that he give up any of his authority to the Control Board as a personal affront.
Mr. Rohatyn, who had a central role in the city's efforts to stave off bankruptcy in the 1970's and who has been a major figure in its finances ever since, was appointed by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and is an adviser to him. Both he and Mr. Cuomo have occasionally expressed displeasure with the spending decisions of the Dinkins administration. But it is not clear to what extent, if any, Mr. Cuomo has endorsed the terms proposed by Mr. Rohatyn.
The Financial Control Board has seven members: the Governor, the Mayor, the City and State Comptrollers and three members appointed by the Governor.
City officials said yesterday that if Mr. Rohatyn insisted on having the board certify a long-range budget-balancing plan, his offer could amount to a "pseudo control period" that would severely distress Mr. Dinkins. The officials also said that it could violate assurances given by Mr. Cuomo that the state would help the city without conditions.
But the officials said that they had not been fully briefed on the plan and that they preferred to assume that Mr. Rohatyn wanted a more limited role for the Control Board. The board now issues reports analyzing financial plans submitted by the city every quarter.
"The Control Board has always had the ability to review our plan and comment on it," said Norman Steisel, the First Deputy Mayor. "We assume that the current rules will continue to be the rules."
Asked for comment, Anne Crowley, a spokeswoman for Governor Cuomo, said, "Felix Rohatyn hasn't finished his work on this."
She added that the Control Board would in due course comment on the city's financial plan "in any event" and that "both the Governor and the Mayor understood this."
 
'All Very Touchy'
 Mr. Rohatyn is scheduled to present his plan tomorrow at a meeting of the M.A.C. board. He declined to comment on the plan, saying that the corporation's lawyers were still reviewing it and that it was subject to change. "I'm not confirming or denying anything," he said. "This is all very touchy."
In the last two days, however, he has sketched much of it out for city officials, bond-rating agencies, union leaders and the Control Board's private members. Some said that without the details it was unclear how much authority the Mayor would, in practice, cede to the Control Board.
On the one hand, they said, the Control Board may have the practical, if not the legal, power to hold up hundreds of millions of dollars in funds unless the Mayor complies with the Control Board's wishes.
On the other hand, they said, the Governor and the Mayor might be able to simply use the board as a means of reassuring the bond-rating agencies and financial markets that the Mayor was serious about shrinking the size of city government.
 
Union Leader Is Optimistic
 Barry Feinstein, president of Local 237 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which represents thousands of city workers, said he was awaiting an analysis from his fiscal staff before commenting.
"We are cautiously optimistic that the efforts of Felix Rohatyn are clearly meant to help in this very difficult time," Mr. Feinstein said.
City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman confirmed that she had been briefed on the plan but declined to discuss it, except to say that she would oppose any effort to diminish the authority of elected city officials.
Ms. Holtzman noted that the city was still paying $300 million a year to erase debts left over from the city's fiscal crisis in the 1970's. She said she did not want to burden future generations with the city's current problems.
Bond-rating agencies have said that the M.A.C. help would amount to "deficit financing" by the city -- the selling of bonds or notes to cover a budget deficit. The agencies have warned that such an action could prompt them to lower the city's rating. .
Hyman Grossman, a managing director at Standard & Poor's, the rating agency, said that even if the Financial Control Board certified that the city's plan would achieve a permanent balance, that would not "necessarily wash if our opinion is different than the Control Board's."

CORRECTION-DATE: May 16, 1991, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about a proposal to reduce New York City's budget deficit with the help of the Municipal Assistance Corporation referred incorrectly in some copies to the bonds that would be refinanced to provide the money. They were the corporation's bonds, not the city's.

HEADLINE: Washington Talk;
Return of a Lawmaker, Dusting Off an Old Idea

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 14

 BODY:
At a time when most Democrats have modest legislative agendas, it would be normal to dismiss as an idealistic neophyte any newly elected Congressman who wants to spend $110 billion or so on education and roads and the environment and that sort of thing.
But Ray Thornton represents not only the Second Congressional District of Arkansas, but also a more optimistic time in Congress. When he calls for a domestic Marshall Plan to rebuild the United States economy, the reaction of his colleagues may be skeptical, but it is hardly dismissive. 
 Mr. Thornton was here for three terms in the mid-1970's, in the thick of successful efforts to expand power for the House rank and file and to make decisions about issues like energy conservation and research into recombinant DNA. Most telling of all, he served on the House Judiciary Committee and cast reluctant but critical votes to recommend the impeachment of President Richard M. Nixon in 1974.
Some of Mr. Thornton's current optimism may also be a consequence of not being around Washington in the 1980's, a depressing time for Democrats here. He left in 1978 after losing a tight Senate primary to then Gov. David Pryor and fellow Representative Jim Guy Tucker. Mr. Thornton spent the decade as president of Arkansas State University and then the larger University of Arkansas.
Twelve years is a long time to be away from the House. Fred Schwengel, president of the Capitol Historical Society who is a former Representative from Iowa, said he could not think of anyone in this century who had returned after a longer interval except Jeanette Rankin, the Montana pacifist and Republican who in 1917 voted against the United States entering World War I, was out of Congress for 22 years and returned in 1941 in time to cast the only vote in Congress against declaring war on Japan.
Mr. Thornton jokes that he decided to leave university life because "I got tired of all the politics." But he really ran again, at the age of 62, because he had this Marshall Plan idea.
As he put it to the House last month, "The United States should formulate and pursue new strategies to insure that it remains the mightiest nation in the world militarily, while developing its human and material resources to advance its position as the dominant economic power in the world."
He said weaknesses were developing in the economy, from abandoning energy conservation to letting the physical, commercial and technological infrastructure deteriorate while support for education eroded.
"We need to develop strategies for America as appropriate for our needs as those we employed with such success in rebuilding Europe and Japan," he said. "In short, we need a Marshall Plan for America."
The original Marshall Plan, in which the United States spent $13 billion to aid European recovery from 1948 to 1952, cost about 2 percent of the gross national product at that time. Mr. Thornton maintains that spending 2 percent of the current G.N.P., or about $110 billion, will not be as costly as failing to make the investment. He has offered only modest suggestions for raising revenue, including an import fee on crude oil.
The Thornton proposal is more of an idea than a plan, and he makes his way around Washington trying to enlist interest or, as he says, "trying to give it away" to leaders or officials who have more influence than he.
On his return to Congress this year Mr. Thornton found the House a friendly place, not greatly changed in its methods since he left. "The era of extremely strong committee chairmen has ended," he said, "and that's not necessarily positive."
But there are some differences in spirit. "In the 70's Congress was a functioning organization that was setting out to meet challenges," he said. That spirit can be found in the country today, he added, the "can-do" idea "that we can accomplish American goals," though it is sometimes harder to find at the Capitol than it used to be.
This is a less drastic, more diffuse challenge than he faced in his first term, as a freshman from Arkansas voting to impeach a President who two years earlier had carried Mr. Thornton's district, which includes Little Rock, with 69 percent of the vote. But those tense days taught an inspiring lesson.
When Mr. Nixon resigned a few days after the committee's impeachment vote, the watchword of the capital was, "The system worked."

HEADLINE: PRESIDENT CHOOSES NO. 2 SECURITY AIDE FOR C.I.A. DIRECTOR

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 14

 BODY:
President Bush today gave Robert M. Gates an unusual second chance to become Director of Central Intelligence. The President chose the career intelligence analyst for a job he was denied four years ago in the face of intensive questioning about the Iran-contra affair.
In selecting Mr. Gates, a veteran of 25 years in Government bureaucracy with no political profile or base of his own, Mr. Bush reiterated his view that the espionage agencies should devote themselves to intelligence gathering and remain aloof from both politics and policymaking. Mr. Bush said that was the way he ran the intelligence services when he was Director himself in 1976, although he moved into the position after serving as chairman of the Republican National Committee, as well as a Congressman from Texas from 1966 to 1970.
 
'He Will Do a Superb Job'
 "I will keep it the way it was when I was there," Mr. Bush said today. "And it will be -- he will be at the table when matters of -- or when we need the intelligence to make critical decisions on foreign affairs. He will not be a political -- trying to shape policy. But he will do a superb job as a professional intelligence officer, heading the intelligence agency. That's the way it's going to be." 
 That often-repeated mandate seems to reflect Mr. Bush's desire to avoid the experiences of the Reagan Administration, when William J. Casey, the intelligence chief, not only was heavily involved in policymaking but embarked on an ambitious covert operation, the Iran-contra affair. That secret effort to sell arms to Iran and divert some of the profits to the Nicaraguan rebels crippled Mr. Reagan's final years in office.
White House aides took pains today to say that if Mr. Gates is confirmed by the Senate he would abide by Mr. Bush's wishes to stick to intelligence gathering and analysis.
 
Man of Strong Opinions
 The 47-year-old Mr. Gates has a reputation for loyally defending official policy. But he also has strong opinions and clashed with Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d in 1989 over Mr. Gates's intention to give a speech expressing skepticism about whether the Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev could deliver on his promises of reform. The speech was shelved after Mr. Baker objected to its pessimistic tone.
Although Mr. Gates, who is now deputy national security adviser, was forced to withdraw from nomination to the intelligence post in 1987 because of questions about his actions during the Iran-contra affair, Mr. Bush today brushed aside concerns that the Gates confirmation hearing would revive that debate and put his own role in the affair under renewed scrutiny.
The President said he had "no qualms at all" about that prospect and was "very, very pleased" by consultations between his aides and influential senators who have told the White House that they believed Mr. Gates could be confirmed to replace William H. Webster, who announced his resignation last week.
Generally, members of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, which will review Mr. Gates's nomination first, reacted positively to the choice. They included the Democratic chairman of the panel, David L. Boren of Oklahoma, and Alan Cranston, Democrat of California, who opposed Mr. Gates in 1987.
 
Time Expected to Help
 The Administration is counting on the passage of time, and Mr. Gates's enhanced prestige as a result of his work at the White House, especially during the Persian Gulf crisis, to smooth the nomination proceedings. But it was clear that lawmakers would focus hard on Mr. Gates's involvement in the Iran-contra affair, which could prove embarrassing for Mr. Bush politically even if it did not derail the nomination.
"I would expect extended hearings to probe those questions," said Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum, Democrat of Ohio, the only committee member who directly criticized the naming of Mr. Gates. "I am surprised and disappointed that President Bush has made such a controversial choice."
Mr. Boren said confirmation hearings would probably not begin until June and that the Senate would probably not vote on the nomination until August or September.
Administration officials said the President's selection of Mr. Gates reflected a balancing of Mr. Bush's concerns about the Iran-contra scandal with his desire to reward a loyal aide and appoint an intelligence director who Mr. Bush believes is likely to run the Central Intelligence Agency the way he wants.
 
Shift in Lines of Power
 The move also promises to produce an important shift in the makeup of the Administration's national security team and the lines of power within the White House.
The White House had been seeking to ease Mr. Webster out of office in hopes of finding an intelligence chief who would be more engaged in day-to-day operations.
Officials said Mr. Gates was expected to fill that gap, even though the intelligence agencies are trying to shift their resources away from his primary area of expertise, the Soviet Union, and focus more on economic issues, as well as social unrest and political tensions, in the developing countries.
Mr. Bush said Mr. Gates would not be made a member of the Cabinet, as Mr. Casey was under Mr. Reagan. Mr. Webster also did not hold Cabinet rank.
"But he will do a superb job as a professional intelligence officer, heading the intelligence agency," Mr. Bush said. "That's the way it's going to be."
Taking the new job will cost Mr. Gates his coveted position in the core group that made all the decisions during the Persian Gulf crisis, a group that included Mr. Baker, Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser, and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney. But officials said Mr. Gates was not fighting that.
 
'Got Lifelong Ambition'
 "Bush is going to keep the C.I.A. just as it was when he headed it and Bob Gates fits perfectly into that," one official said. "He's a bureaucrat. He's got his lifelong ambition, head of the agency. He's happy."
The White House said no successor had been selected for Mr. Gates, a choice in which Mr. Scowcroft is expected to have a strong say.
But Administration officials said that the White House was likely to look for someone roughly Mr. Gates's age who will, as one put it, "be young and aggressive but know he's No. 2."
Mr. Scowcroft, who zealously protects his close relationship with Mr. Bush, focused on long-range policy planning and gave Mr. Gates the day-to-day responsibility for running the staff of the National Security Council.
Mr. Gates also played a major role in forming the committee of department deputies that supervises the day-to-day execution of military and foreign policy and was chairman of the panel.
"His replacement is going to need to know the National Security Council, State and Defense and not require a long learning curve," one official said. "Having a track record with Brent is also going to help, since the deputy is going to have to work in tandem with Scowcroft the way Bob has."
Of the officials currently available within the Administration, at least three seem to fit these requirements: Robert Kimmitt, Under Secretary of State for political affairs; Robert Zoellick, the State Department counsellor, and Paul Wolfowitz, Under Secretary of Defense for policy.
James Lilley, the Ambassador to China whose name was mentioned for the intelligence director's job, appears to be under consideration for a new post. He is an old friend of Mr. Bush, is friendly with Mr. Scowcroft and has an intelligence background.
Some Senators were strongly supportive of Mr. Gates's nomination. "Mr. Gates has demonstrated by his service in many capacities that he is an extremely able and non-partisan professional in the intelligence field," said Mr. Boren.
Senator Slade Gorton, Republican of Washington, who is a panel member, said through a spokesman that there were "valid questions that deserve answers" about the Iran-contra period. But he said he supported the nomination and that Mr. Gates was "extremely qualified and has tremendous experience in the intelligence community."
Senator William S. Cohen, Republican of Maine, who served as vice chairman of the committee during the Iran-contra scandal, said he believed Mr. Gates would be confirmed although "there will be a hard look at some of the issues" from that period.
Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, said: "It would be premature to take a position on Mr. Gates's confirmation until the hearing process is over. But I believe he is fully qualified for the job and unless disqualifying information should be revealed during the hearing, the President's choice should be honored."
Mr. Cranston said: "I am favorably disposed toward the nomination. I will, of course, wait until his confirmation hearing is completed before making a final decision."
But Senator Bill Bradley, Democrat of New Jersey, who also opposed Mr. Gates in 1987, has said he still had reservations about Mr. Gates. Today, he said, "I intend to pursue the most important unresolved questions about Mr. Gates's record, his view on the future challenges and direction of the intelligence community and its role in protecting U.S. interests."
 
Bush on Foreign Affairs
 During the news conference today at which he named Mr. Gates for the intelligence job, Mr. Bush also said that he did not consider Mr. Baker's current mission to the Middle East a failure because of Syria's refusal to join peace talks with Israel.
"There are ups and downs in this process," Mr. Bush said, and speaking of President Hafez al-Assad, he added, "I would like to see President Assad do what the Secretary of State has asked. But we'll just keep working on this."
Mr. Bush said there had been no agreement on a date for a delayed Soviet-American summit that was supposed to be held in Moscow this year. Asked whether he would support Mr. Gorbachev's request to attend a meeting in London in July of the leaders of the seven most powerful industrial democracies, Mr. Bush said he would discuss the idea with his allies.
"I think it's important that if he go there, something positive will happen," Mr. Bush said.
Senior Administration officials have said Mr. Bush did not favor giving Mr. Gorbachev full observer status at the conference but would support a plan under which Mr. Gorbachev met with the other leaders in London either before or after their talks.

HEADLINE: Man in the News: Robert Michael Gates;
Analyst With Strong Views

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 14

 BODY:
Though President Bush said today that he did not want the Central Intelligence Agency involved in policy making, by nominating Robert M. Gates as the agency's new director Mr. Bush has picked a man with strong opinions about the Soviet Union and a strong belief in aggressively packaging intelligence to serve the Administration's foreign policy agenda.
Mr. Gates, 47 years old, would be the first former director of the C.I.A.'s analytical arm, or Directorate of Intelligence, to move up to the agency's top post. This reflects the growing interest in the Bush Administration in understanding fast-changing events in the Soviet Union, Europe and the third world, as opposed to trying to shape them through covert action, Administration officials said. 
 In his 25 years in Government, Mr. Gates has served a number of Presidents from both political parties, but despite his image as a low-profile and cautious bureaucrat, he is known at the C.I.A. as a tough and blunt-spoken task master who rose through the ranks by making well-researched judgments and predictions for his bosses, who often complained that agency analysts were writing history instead of predicting it.
His reputation is that of a scholarly professional who believes that policy makers need timely guidance on potential crises and trouble spots. But he is also known as a man who has not been afraid to use his analytical skills to promote his own policy views, particularly his tough, pessimistic attitude toward the Soviets.
In contrast with the departing Director, William H. Webster, Mr. Gates advocates detailed involvement by the director in the substance of daily intelligence issues and a close relationship with the White House, both to convey important developments quickly and to take Presidential responses back to agency analysts so they better know the views of the decision makers.
"It tells you a change in the world we live in," said a former C.I.A. Deputy Director, Bobby Inman, who took himself out of the running for the director's post. "For 25 years, how good you were in conducting operations against the Soviets was the fastest ticket to the top," Mr. Inman added. "Now it's trying to understand this changing world."
 
Chairman of Pivotal Panel
 Under Mr. Bush, Mr. Gates has played a pivotal role in shaping policy for the President as chairman of the "deputies committee," a group of subcabinet managers from the Pentagon, State Department, C.I.A. and other agencies involved in a particular crisis or policy decision.
The differences in policy formulation and intelligence analysis appear subtle in such a setting. Today Mr. Bush attempted to define the sometimes blurry line that he wants the Director of Central Intelligence, or D.C.I., to observe between the delivering of intelligence and the formulation of policy.
Mr. Gates wrestled with the same question in a 1989 article about how the C.I.A. should serve the White House. Mr. Gates wrote: "The role of the D.C.I. is central to understanding the President's needs and conveying analysis to him." He added that "aggressiveness in putting substantive matters before the President" and access to him were of critical importance.
Mr. Webster met frequently with President Bush, going to the White House several mornings a week to present the daily intelligence briefing, and Mr. Gates could expect to have at least as much access.
 
Clashes on Soviet Prospects
 Robert Michael Gates was born on Sept. 25, 1943, in Wichita, Kan. He graduated from the College of William and Mary and holds a master's degree in history from Indiana University and a doctorate in Soviet studies from Georgetown University.
As a specialist on the Soviet Union, Mr. Gates's best known clashes in the foreign policy establishment have been over the course of the Soviet Union.. Along with Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, Mr. Gates has been the Bush Administration's most ardent skeptic on the chances of President Mikhail Gorbachev's delivering the Soviet Union from economic collapse.
"He has his own views on the Soviet Union, which he was willing to articulate when it was not popular under the dominant secretaries of state," said Zbigniew Brzezinski, national security adviser under President Jimmy Carter. "He had a very skeptical prognosis for Gorbachev when the Reagan Administration was plunging into a love affair with him."
 
A Fundamental Struggle
 Even before Mr. Gorbachev ushered in the era of glasnost and perestroika, Mr. Gates regarded the East-West competition as a fundamental struggle over the roles of citizens and the state.
In a paper he delivered in 1983, Mr. Gates asserted that the nature of the United States-Soviet conflict was over weaponry, or markets, or a misunderstanding from World War II.
"The threat posed by the Soviet Union -- by Russia -- is the lineal descendent of the same threat Western civilizations have faced for three and a half thousand years: it is the threat posed by despotisms against the more or less steadily developing concept that the highest goal of the state is to protect and foster the creative capabilities and the liberties of the individual."
When Mr. Gorbachev appeared on the scene, some analysts believe that Mr. Gates was slow to recognize the scale of the revolution that the Soviet leader sought to unleash.
"There is no question that Bob Gates has had a very conservative view of the character of change under Gorbachev," said Graham Fuller, a former C.I.A. intelligence officer who worked under Mr. Gates and applauded his nomination. "But I think he is too smart to be closed minded," Mr. Fuller added.
During a visit to the Soviet Union by Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d in 1989, Mr. Gorbachev mentioned in their Kremlin dialogue that he understood that Mr. Gates was in charge of a special White House unit assigned to discredit the Soviet leader. Without giving his guests an opportunity to deny the assertion, Mr. Gorbachev admonished the American officials to help build a new relationship so that Mr. Gates would be out of a job.
 
Skeptical Views Repeated
 Today, Mr. Gates is said to feel some vindication for his early views, with economic reforms stalled and Mr. Gorbachev's political program blocked by independence movements in the Soviet republics.
In a speech this month to the American Newspaper Publisher's Association, Mr. Gates reiterated his skepticism. Terming the Soviet situation "a formula for serious trouble," he said, "The old system is being dismantled and destroyed before a new one has been created to provide order."
Mr. Gates first gave voice to his views on intelligence policy in the Reagan Administration, where he was named by the William J. Casey to the top C.I.A. analytical post, Deputy Director for Intelligence, in 1982.
Mr. Gates joined the agency in 1968 as an intelligence analyst. He and his wife, Rebecca, have two children, Eleanor Marie and Bradley Robert.
Mr. Gates got his first opportunity to get on a fast career track in 1971 when he was assigned to the first negotiations with the Soviets on limiting strategic arms. By mid-1974, he had begun his first tour on the National Security Council Staff.
He returned to the C.I.A.'s Langley headquarters in early 1980 and worked in various capacities until being named Deputy Director, the agency's No. 2 job, in April 1986, in the midst of the uproar over sales of weapons to Iran and financial support to the contra rebels in Nicaragua.
With the death of Mr. Casey in 1987, the nomination of Mr. Gates to succeed him faltered on his explanations before a Senate panel about his knowledge of the Iran-contra matter.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS PEOPLE;
An 'Orderly Transition' Begins at Korn/Ferry

BYLINE: By ISADORE BARMASH

 BODY:
One of the nation's best-known executive recruiters, Lester B. Korn, co-founder and chairman of Korn/Ferry International, said yesterday that he was retiring after 22 years and would become the concern's chairman emeritus. Richard M. Ferry, 53, the other co-founder, will assume the chairman's duties while remaining president and chief executive.
In a telephone interview yesterday from Los Angeles, the 55-year-old Mr. Korn said: "In June 1988, I had a heart bypass but I have recovered from that. The main reason for my decision to retire is that Dick Ferry and I decided to begin an orderly transition of management at age 55 rather than 60. This is the first big step in that direction." 
 Following that, he said, "It's clear that the governance of our company will change in the next two to three years since we have a group of executives among our 650 employees who are very capable." Mr. Korn plans to continue as Korn/Ferry's chairman emeritus for five years but will also devote himself to other interests. These include active participation in the Republican Party, he said, as well as in ConAm Management Company, an apartment developer, and in Curb Communications, a motion picture production company, in which he holds a 40 percent interest.
Since its founding in 1969, Korn/ Ferry, with headquarters offices in both Los Angeles and New York, has expanded to 41 offices in the United States and internationally, becoming the largest search firm in this country, with revenues this year of about $100 million. Mr. Korn remains its largest shareholder. The North American offices account for about half of the total revenues and half of the employees.
Despite the recession, which held the company's revenues to a relatively low 1 to 2 percent rise last year, he said, "We see executive search as a dynamic growth field once the recession ends."
Mr. Korn served as United States representative to the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations from 1987 through October 1988 after being appointed by President Ronald Reagan. He was born in New York and graduated from both the University of California at Los Angeles and from the Harvard University Graduate School of Business. Afterward, he was a management consultant with Peat Marwick Mitchell & Co., Los Angeles, from 1961 to 1966 and then served as a partner until he started his own firm with Mr. Ferry.
The author of "The Success Profile," Mr. Korn lives in San Diego. He relaxes by "reading and spending as much time as I can with my wife, Carolbeth, and my two daughters."
