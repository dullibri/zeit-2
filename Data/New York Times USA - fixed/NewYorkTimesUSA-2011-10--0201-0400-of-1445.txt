HEADLINE: Britain and European Union Agree on Regulating Derivatives Trades

BYLINE: By STEPHEN CASTLE

 BODY:
7:29 p.m. Updated
Britain struck a deal Tuesday with its European Union allies on how to regulate trading in over-the-counter derivatives, a compromise that the government said would improve regulation and protect financial markets across Europe. 
At a meeting of finance ministers in Luxembourg, the British chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, won a concession that would in most cases prevent the national regulator from being overruled on the authorization of trading by companies in over-the-counter derivatives in Britain.
An over-the-counter derivative is a financial instrument derived from another asset, like a stock or a bond, that is traded privately between parties rather than on an exchange. British officials say that London's financial district handles around 75 percent of the European market for such derivatives.
In the United States, regulators, armed with the Dodd-Frank Act, have already moved to overhaul the over-the-counter market. American banks oppose many of the changes, saying the restrictions will force business overseas while foreign regulators lag behind with their own set of derivatives rules.
Mr. Osborne also secured a pledge that the European Commission would extend regulation to exchange-traded derivatives, which Germany dominates. Britain argued that the extended regulation was needed to establish a level playing field in Europe.
''We came here in a minority, somewhat outnumbered,'' Mr. Osborne said. ''Through some hard negotiation we very much improved the directive. We are going to have what we all wanted, which is more effective regulation of the derivative market.''
The European Commission argues that the new rules will provide vital transparency because trades will have to be registered and regulators will have access to that data.
The negotiations occurred amid growing tension between Britain and some European partners over financial services regulation. Britain fears that France and Germany want to ratchet up regulation to put London at a disadvantage as a financial center. Under European single-market rules, Britain could have been outvoted had it not struck an agreement.
The proposed changes, which will now be negotiated with the European Parliament, call for trades in over-the-counter derivatives in the 27 nations of the union to be reported to data centers. Regulators would have access to those data centers, while the newly created European Securities and Markets Authority, based in Paris, would have responsibility for the surveillance.
The European commissioner for financial services, Michel Barnier, welcomed the compromise on Tuesday, saying it would allow negotiations to proceed. In the past, Mr. Barnier has said that the lack of a regulatory framework for over-the-counter derivatives contributed to the financial crisis.
''No financial market can afford to remain a Wild West territory,'' he has said.
The British government is also resisting plans, supported by Germany and France, for a financial transaction tax unless it can be agreed upon at a global level.

HEADLINE: U.S. Senate's Bill on Tariffs Angers China

BYLINE: By RICK GLADSTONE; Jennifer Steinhauer and Carl Hulse contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
China expressed strong objections on Tuesday to a bill in the United States Senate that would threaten higher tariffs on some Chinese goods in response to what the bill's sponsors call China's policy of keeping its currency artificially depressed to give its exports a price advantage. 
The Chinese objections came as the Senate began debate on the bill, which would require the Treasury Department to determine whether China is manipulating its currency and then order the Commerce Department to impose tariffs on certain Chinese goods.
Ma Zhaoxu, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said the bill ''seriously violates rules of the World Trade Organization and obstructs China-U.S. trade ties.'' The statement, reported by Xinhua, China's official news agency, urged senators to ''rationally understand Sino-U.S. trade cooperation, which is mutually beneficial in nature, and stop pressuring China through domestic lawmaking.''
The statement did not specify what steps, if any, China might take if the legislation were to pass. But Mr. Ma said the bill would ''further escalate the exchange rate issue by adopting protectionist measures with an excuse of 'currency imbalance.' ''
While the specter of the Senate bill may have vexed Chinese officials, its prospects for passage on Capitol Hill seemed dim. Speaker John A. Boehner told reporters on Tuesday that although he was ''concerned about the China currency situation,'' he did not agree with the policy implications of the Senate bill and would not commit to bringing it to his chamber's floor.
''It's pretty dangerous to be moving legislation through the U.S. Congress forcing someone to deal with the value of their currency,'' Mr. Boehner said.
The White House has also reacted coolly to the bill. While administration officials have not rejected the measure outright, they have suggested that it could create trade problems with China.
Though some Republicans suggest that the bill would set off a trade war, others, as well as some Democrats, say the bill is needed to save American jobs. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, told reporters in a rejoinder to Mr. Boehner, ''It's dangerous for our country to continue to be bullied by China.''
The value of China's currency, the renminbi, has become an increasingly contentious issue in Chinese-American relations. China's critics contend that Beijing intervenes in the currency markets to keep the value of the renminbi artificially low, making Chinese goods cheaper abroad and American goods more expensive in China. Lawmakers and some economists say the policy undercuts American businesses and worsens the American unemployment rate.
The renminbi has been rising in value. One dollar now buys about 6.4 renminbi, compared with 6.8 renminbi in June 2010, when China's central bank loosened some restrictions on the currency. Economists estimate that the renminbi is still undervalued by about 25 percent relative to the dollar.
China continues to run large trade surpluses with the United States: $273 billion in 2010, compared with $83 billion a decade earlier. But China's overall trade surplus has declined, relative to the size of its economy, since 2007, a trend that its officials cite as evidence that the renminbi is drawing closer to its natural market value.

HEADLINE: Superdome's New Name

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR

 BODY:
Since 1975, the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans has had no other name. But on Tuesday, it officially became the Mercedes-Benz Superdome with the German luxury automaker's acquisition of the naming rights to the home of the New Orleans Saints. 
Although the financial details of the 10-year deal were not announced, the money is earmarked to replace most or all of the subsidies that the state of Louisiana pays the team. In a previous lease that expired in 2009, the team received a total of $186.5 million from the state; under the new lease, the annual payments were capped at $6 million.
The Superdome deal follows by six weeks MetLife's agreement to rename the stadium shared by the Jets and Giants in East Rutherford, N.J., at a cost of $17 million to $20 million annually over 25 years. The recession chilled the naming rights market and reduced the amount of money the Giants and Jets would have gotten in a healthier economy.
The Superdome, which was recently renovated by the state, served as a refuge for people displaced by Hurricane Katrina and was heavily damaged. It will host the Super Bowl in 2013, the seventh time for the stadium.
In a statement, Tom Benson, the team's owner, said: ''The investment being made by a premier international brand who believes in 'the best or nothing,' is a tremendous compliment to all of those who worked so hard to make the stadium what it is today.''
Benson owns Mercedes-Benz dealerships in New Orleans and San Antonio.
Mercedes-Benz USA's interest in the naming rights deal was piqued during a casual conversation at a dinner attended by Benson, his wife, Gayle, and Mercedes executives earlier this year. ''She said, 'Look, wouldn't it be nice to have the Mercedes-Benz name on the Superdome?' '' said Greg Bensel, a spokesman for the Saints. That led to further meetings, including a formal presentation by the company's executives in Germany.
The Saints got the right to sell the naming rights in their current lease.

HEADLINE: Taliban Using Modern Means To Add to Sway

BYLINE: By ALISSA J. RUBIN

 BODY:
LASHKAR GAH, Afghanistan -- Punctually, at 8 o'clock every evening, the cellphone signals disappear in this provincial capital. Under pressure from the Taliban, the major carriers turn off their signal towers, effectively severing most of the connections to the rest of the world.
This now occurs in some portion of more than half the provinces in Afghanistan, and exemplifies the Taliban's new and more subtle ways of asserting themselves, even as NATO generals portray the insurgents as a diminished force less able to hold ground. The question is whether the Taliban need to hold territory as they once did in order to influence the population. Increasingly, it seems, the answer is no.
Tactics like the cellphone offensive have allowed the Taliban to project their presence in far more insidious and sophisticated ways, using the instruments of modernity that they once shunned. The shutoff sends a daily reminder to hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of Afghans that the Taliban still hold substantial sway over their future. 
It is just one part of a broader shift in Taliban strategy that has focused on intimidation, carefully chosen assassinations and limited but spectacular assaults. While often avoiding large-scale combat with NATO forces, the Taliban and their allies in the Haqqani network have effectively undermined peace talks with the Afghan government of President Hamid Karzai and sought to pave the way for a gradual return to power as the American-led forces begin scaling back military operations in the country.
Assaults like the rocket attack on the American Embassy in Kabul on Sept. 13, for which American officials blamed the Haqqanis, effectively shift the fight to cities, where it is harder for NATO to respond with air power for fear of harming civilians. They also allow the Taliban to capture the airwaves for hours, especially in media-saturated cities, and fuel an aura of crisis.
Likewise, the assassination on Sept. 20 in Kabul of Burhanuddin Rabbani, the head of Afghanistan's peace council, dominated the news and reopened dangerous fissures between the country's Dari-speaking north and the Pashtun south, in a single calculated blow. The new Taliban do not aspire to kill a lot of people, it seems, just a few in the right places and in positions of power.
The Rabbani assassination not only demonstrated the insurgents' rejection of the peace process, but it also reminded people of their ability to shape the next chapter in the country's history as the Americans prepare to leave. Similarly, the Taliban have sought to remake their image this year as a way of positioning themselves to play a prominent role in Afghanistan's future. It is a two-track strategy.
Interviews with dozens of Afghans suggest that throughout the country the Taliban have married locally tailored terrorist campaigns with new flexibility on issues like education and business development.
The combination plays on the uncertainty gnawing at Afghans about the looming American withdrawal, while making the most of the insurgency's limited resources. The aim is to undermine the Afghan government by making people question whether it can protect them, while trying to project the image of a group that is more open to the world than when the Taliban ruled the country in the 1990s.
For now, especially in ethnic Pashtun areas of the country, the Taliban, who are also ethnic Pashtuns, appear to be achieving their goal of making the future seems up for grabs.
''The morale in Kandahar, in Oruzgan, in Helmand and in Kabul of the ordinary civilian was at the lowest level we've seen throughout July,'' said Ahmad Nader Nadery, the deputy director of the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission. ''I've never seen that much anxiety, fear and concern in ordinary Afghans and in some of the government officials.
''People say, first, the ability of the Afghan government to reach out and to build on the already existing security arrangements is minimal, and they point to the bigger crisis the government is in, and in addition they see that the international community withdrawal has started,'' he said.
Certainly, while NATO troops are in Afghanistan the Taliban cannot enforce their ideas -- but with the transition under way, no one doubts that the Western forces are leaving. So while NATO insists that the Taliban are losing physical ground, insurgents may be gaining psychological space.
''Their 2011 spring-summer military campaign has not materialized the way they predicted, because they are under unprecedented pressure,'' said Lt. Col. Jimmie E. Cummings Jr., a spokesman for the NATO headquarters. The Taliban have been ''prevented from regaining the momentum'' they had before the troop increase, he said.
NATO also sees less support from the civilian population for the Taliban. ''We saw that after the fighters had left for their sanctuaries in the winter, they returned back to communities who no longer supported them,'' Colonel Cummings said. ''They lost their safe houses, I.E.D. factories, weapons caches and freedom of movement.'' I.E.D. stands for improvised explosive device, usually a roadside bomb.
NATO commanders concede that spectacular attacks, like the one on the American Embassy, are ''I.O. victories'' -- meaning information operation -- said Gen. John R. Allen, commanding general for NATO forces in Afghanistan. They resist equating that with any larger gains, though privately some officers concede that the Taliban's ability to switch cellphones off and on is another such victory.
Diplomats are hoping that the Taliban's turn to more psychological methods could be a precursor to peace talks, but they also admit it could be a clever strategy to conserve their forces until the West withdraws more troops.
''We have hurt them, but I am not sure how much we've hurt them,'' Ryan C. Crocker, the United States ambassador to Afghanistan, said in August. ''And I'm not sure we're going to know for a while how much we've hurt them.'' This could ''ultimately be positive,'' Mr. Crocker said, citing the reasoning of Mr. Karzai. ''This is what Karzai would describe as the Afghan Taliban: recognizing that their previous form of government did not win hearts and minds and they are shifting to deal with the population again, and actually that would bring them closer to a dialogue with the government.''
Others view it more as the Taliban's positioning themselves to become the chief power in a number of areas of the country, once the bulk of NATO forces leave. A longtime Western observer of Taliban tactics said the insurgents ''are moving into their own hold-and-build phase; they are prepositioning for 2014.''
Just about all NATO combat forces are scheduled for withdrawal by the end of 2014, leaving Afghan security forces in control. So far, the Afghans have demonstrated a limited ability to fight on their own. With that in mind, many Afghans are hedging their bets and keeping avenues open to the Taliban because they believe that the government may not protect them once NATO leaves.
Wardak Province, which borders Kabul, is one place that seems up for grabs. It is also where in much of the province the cellphones go down for 13 hours daily. The Taliban view the cutoffs as a line of defense, according to Taliban commanders and spokesmen. When the phones are off, informants cannot call in Taliban locations to American forces who might carry out raids, and the Americans cannot use listening devices to track the location of insurgents.
''Our main goal is to degrade the enemy's capability in tracking down our mujahedeen,'' said Zabiullah Mujahid, the Taliban's spokesman for eastern and northern Afghanistan.
But a broader effect is to remind the population that the Taliban, not the government, are in control.
Hajji Mohammad Hazrat Janan, head of the provincial council in Wardak, summed up the situation: ''In those areas where Taliban have their direct or indirect control, they demand that the telephone towers be turned off at night from 5 p.m. to 8 a.m. So we know they are here.
''There are several reasons for attacking the cellphone towers, but here the locals are hopeless,'' he said. ''Where should they go and complain? Who should they go to and complain? The government? Innocent people get arrested and get killed by the government, and no one cares about them, so the cellphone towers are very small problems here.''
The Taliban turn off the phones by threatening to bomb or burn down the towers. It costs the phone companies $200,000 to $250,000 to repair a tower. The Taliban often threaten any workman who comes to restore one.
In some cases, most of a province's phones may be turned off from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.; in others, the signal may be off 20 hours a day. In some provinces, like Zabul, there is no phone service outside the provincial capital, Qalat, and there it is limited to five hours a day. A handful of provinces, generally those that are more stable, may have only one or two districts where the phones are off in the evening, and the rest have 24-hour service.
NATO has been helping in the construction of cell towers by the Afghan wireless network, on military bases where they would be protected ultimately by the Afghan security forces. So far the number of these towers that are working is relatively small.
''In the last 12 months we had some incidents such as destruction of telephone towers by bombing them,'' said Asadullah Hamidi, the governor's spokesman in Kapisa Province, northeast of Kabul, where he said three cell towers were destroyed in the two districts where the Taliban were active.
''The government is trying to resolve this issue, but still we have many problems that we cannot overcome very quickly,'' he said, adding that it was not safe for repair teams to enter the areas to rebuild the towers.
A manager for Etisalat, one of the four major cellphone providers in Afghanistan, who asked that his name not be used because he feared retribution, said the company was under pressure from the Taliban to turn off the signal in Kandahar, one of the three largest urban areas of the country.
''The Taliban strongly threaten us if we don't turn off signal in Kandahar city,'' the manager said. ''They said: 'You are equal to the Americans. The actions we take against Americans, we will take against you. Your employees will be abducted, killed, and the towers will be burned.' ''
''Meanwhile, the government says you should not turn off the signal in Kandahar city,'' he added. ''They said, 'We can protect the sites in the city,' but we don't believe the government will protect the towers.''
Another benefit of the cellphone campaign for the Taliban is that it does not risk civilians' lives, which fits with the Taliban's new push to recast their image.
Apparently in an effort to appear more open, Mullah Muhammad Omar, the Taliban leader, promised in a message in August, at the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, that when the Taliban regained power they would be inclusive to Afghans of all ethnicities, friendly to all countries and eager to develop the economy.
Afghanistan has ''rich mines and high potential for energy resources,'' he said. Then he added in an faintly utopian vein, ''We can make investments in these sectors in conditions of peace and stability and wrangle ourselves from the tentacles of poverty, unemployment and ignorance.''
Professionals and businessmen will be ''encouraged,'' Mullah Omar said. There was no mention of women in the lengthy message, which was translated by the Maryland-based SITE monitoring service, which tracks jihadist communications.
Mr. Mujahid, the Taliban spokesman, said education should be opened to both boys and girls, as long as it is imbued with Islamic values, reversing the Taliban's pre-2001 policies that barred girls from school and encouraged boys to study only the Koran.
The newfound support for education is hardly uniform. In a number of areas the Taliban still intimidate teachers and even execute them, but elsewhere they seem to be trying to find a curriculum they can support.
A prominent former Taliban leader who lives in Kabul, Mullah Abdul Salam Zaeef, who has maintained contact with the Taliban, has, along with several other former Taliban members and others, started a school in Kabul for boys and girls -- in separate buildings -- that teaches the basics: reading, math, English, computer science and religion.
Mullah Zaeef describes it as an ''Islamic education'' with Islamic values and modern knowledge. ''The Taliban now are more interested in Islamic education; they are using technology,'' he said, alluding to the movement's adept use of the Internet, including Web sites, Twitter accounts and Facebook.
''We want to provide a symbol of Islamic education,'' he said. ''But modern -- but totally, 100 percent Islamic.''

HEADLINE: The Wrong Way to Deal With China: Talk of payback may play well politically, but it is dangerous for the economy

 BODY:
China is undeniably manipulating its currency. Countries around the world, including the United States, are losing jobs because their manufacturing industries cannot compete with artificially cheap Chinese goods. For the good of the world economy, and its own long-term economic development, China should stop.
Still, a Senate bill, with strong bipartisan support, to punish countries that manipulate their currencies is a bad idea. It could do even more damage to the American economy if -- as is all too likely -- China decides to retaliate. 
Senator Charles Schumer, a Democrat of New York, declared that the legislation ''is a clear, unwavering message from both parties to China's leaders -- the jig is up; it's time to stop gaming the system or face severe consequences.'' Talk of payback is playing well with his colleagues. On Monday, 79 senators -- 47 Democrats, 31 Republicans and 1 independent -- voted to initiate debate.
Growing trade with China over the past two decades has been one of the leading causes of the decline of manufacturing employment. The United States would likely add jobs over time if the renminbi was allowed to rise more significantly. Some high-technology industries, like the nascent American solar-panel business, would be a lot more competitive against their Chinese rivals. But many of the low-wage businesses lost to Chinese competition -- like toys and textiles -- will never come back.
Stiff retaliatory tariffs or other punishments are also very unlikely to persuade Beijing to swiftly abandon a policy that has been at the core of its economic strategy for two decades. Instead, it could add an explosive new conflict to an already heavy list of bilateral frictions.
The Senate bill is intended to limit the executive branch's discretion. It would require the Treasury Department to identify countries whose currencies were grossly misaligned -- with China everyone's favorite culprit. If Beijing persisted, Washington would be required -- with a delimited presidential waiver -- to stop spending federal dollars on Chinese goods, and consider the renminbi's undervaluation in antidumping cases against Chinese imports. The Treasury Department would also be required to ask the Federal Reserve to consider acting in currency markets to counteract the undervaluation of China's currency. And the bill would increase the pressure on the Commerce Department to impose tariffs on undervalued Chinese products.
Given Beijing's history of meeting fire with fire, many experts fear that China would retaliate on other fronts, like dragging its feet on customs inspections of American imports, opening new antidumping investigations against American goods or slowing its promised efforts to halt the stealing of American intellectual property. Beijing might even slow the renminbi's current rise against the dollar, which translates into an appreciation rate of some 10 percent per year, after taking Chinese inflation into account.
The Obama administration has been pressing Beijing on the broad range of economic relations. It has won some important cases at the World Trade Organization. But it could do more to challenge other illegal policies, like China's ban on the export of rare earth materials used in high-tech industries.
It could more explicitly link China's bid for a bilateral investment agreement with the United States and a designation as a ''market economy'' at the W.T.O. to improvements in Chinese policies. It should press the European Union, Brazil and others to increase the rhetorical heat. China's undervalued currency hurts them, too.
Beijing is not immune to pressure. But the Senate bill is too blunt an instrument.

HEADLINE: In Europe, Signs Of 2nd Recession With Wide Reach

BYLINE: By LIZ ALDERMAN AND JACK EWING; Liz Alderman reported from Paris and Jack Ewing from Frankfurt. Raphael Minder contributed reporting from Lisbon, Gaia Pianigiani from Rome and Stephen Castle from Luxembourg.

 BODY:
PARIS -- The European debt problems that have roiled global financial markets for the last 18 months are showing signs of turning into a far deeper challenge: Europe's second recession in three years.
Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain are already in downturns or fighting to avoid them, as high unemployment and austerity belt-tightening take their toll. But in the last few weeks, even prosperous Germany and France, the Continent's powerhouses, have started to be dragged down, hurt by the ebbing of business orders from indebted countries in the rest of Europe.
European stocks continued their latest plunge on Tuesday, as the German financial giant Deutsche Bank, buffeted by the debt crisis, reduced its profit forecast for the year. Investors were also jolted by news that the French-Belgian investment bank Dexia might be the region's first large bank to need a government rescue as a result of the current debt crisis.
It is not just the Continent's problem. 
The United States, a major banking and trading partner with Europe, is stuck in its own rut -- prompting the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, to warn Tuesday that ''the recovery is close to faltering.'' He told a Congressional panel that the economy could fall into a new recession unless the government took further action.
United States stocks ended up for the day, but had bounced wildly on jitters about Europe and rising fears that Greece would have to default on its sovereign -- or government -- debt. The Greek finance minister said Tuesday that the country could continue to pay its bills at least through mid-November, after other European finance ministers said Greece would not receive its next installment of bailout money before next month, if then.
A downturn in Europe, if it happens, could help tip America back into recession and would undoubtedly ricochet around the world. Europe's banks are among the most interconnected in the world, and the euro is the world's second-largest reserve currency after the dollar.
The 17 European Union nations that share the euro together account for about one-fifth of global output. And emerging markets that are important customers for European exports, like China and Brazil, are beginning to retrench.
''We are the epicenter of this global crisis,'' Jean-Claude Trichet, the president of the European Central Bank, said on Tuesday at the European Parliament.
A growing chorus of analysts now predict that Europe is heading for an outright recession. ''The sovereign debt crisis is like a fungus on the economy,'' said Jorg Kramer, the chief economist at Commerzbank. ''I thought it would be just a slowdown,'' he said. ''But I have changed my mind.''
Goldman Sachs predicted Tuesday that both Germany and France would slip into recession, although other forecasts are less grim.
Already, the euro zone economy has slowed to essentially zero growth. It could stay in a slump, many economists say, at least through next spring. If that happens, tax revenue is likely to fall and unemployment, already high, is expected to rise, making it even more difficult for Europe to address the sovereign debt crisis and protect its shaky banks.
In a sign of how quickly the ground is shifting, the European Central Bank might lower interest rates on Thursday -- just a few months after it started raising them in what is now seen as a misguided effort to stem incipient inflation.
Distress is increasingly evident across Europe.
Philippe Leydier, a French businessman, had been feeling more upbeat until this summer, when orders for his company's corrugated boxes suddenly began to slide. Orders fell further last month, as auto parts makers, electrical engineering firms, farmers and other industries reduced production.
''The euro crisis and the financial crisis linked to the debt of European countries is serious,'' said Mr. Leydier, whose box and paper manufacturing firm, Emin Leydier, in Lyon, often provides an early signal of seismic shifts in economic activity. ''European governments need to find a solution -- and fast.''
In Italy, which has the euro zone's third-largest economy, after those of Germany and France, a 45 billion euro austerity program aimed at reducing debt has many worried about a recession. On Tuesday, the ratings agency Moody's downgraded Italian government bonds by three notches, to A2 from Aa2, and kept a negative outlook on the rating.
Paolo Bastianello, the managing director of Marly's, an Italian clothing retailer, is increasingly discouraged.
At the start of the year, Mr. Bastianello was more optimistic that Europe would escape its troubles and that the government might seriously tackle Italy's problems. ''But the turbulence of the markets and the uncertainty about this abnormal mass of public debt just scare people away from buying,'' he said.
Not everyone is so pessimistic. Some German executives say sales remain healthy, at least so far. ''We don't see any impact on our business,'' said Roland Busch, a member of the management board of Siemens, the electronics and engineering giant based in Munich.
''The economy is cooling down but not more than that,'' said Mr. Busch, who oversees a unit that supplies traffic control systems, streetcars and other products for public works.
Expecting demand for urban infrastructure improvements to grow, Siemens plans to add about 150 people over the next two years to its 850 employees at its complex in Sacramento that makes light-rail cars.
Bucking the trend almost everywhere else in the developed world, unemployment in Germany continues to fall, and there are shortages of skilled workers in several important sectors.
Jens Weidmann, who runs Germany's central bank and serves on the executive board of the European Central Bank, predicted last week that the nation would hit ''a soft patch'' but escape recession.
Commerzbank predicts German growth will slow almost to zero in the fourth quarter of 2011, but not decline. At best, though, it expects Germany to grow by no more than 1 percent in 2012.
The International Monetary Fund is a little more optimistic, predicting growth of 1.3 percent next year in Germany after a healthy 2.7 percent this year.
But the I.M.F. recently acknowledged that it, too, had overestimated the rate of Europe's recovery. It now forecasts that growth in the euro zone will slide to 1.1 percent in 2012, after a 1.6 percent gain this year. In Spain, where tens of thousands of protestors have called for the government to ease its austerity plan, the I.M.F. expects growth to pick up to 1.1 percent next year from 0.8 percent this year.
Still, unemployment in Spain remains at 20 percent, and youth joblessness is nearly twice that rate. Pfizer, the American pharmaceutical giant, said last week it would cut 220 Spanish jobs.
The economy is worse in Portugal, which is operating under a bailout agreement with the European Union and the I.M.F. The I.M.F. warned the new prime minister, Pedro Passos Coelho, that Lisbon still needed to find an additional 1 billion euros in budget savings. But further austerity may only deepen the downturn, with Portugal's economy expected to fall by 1.8 percent this year and 2.3 percent in 2012.
Joao Figueiredo, the owner of a small ship repair yard in Lisbon, expects his first annual loss since 2002. ''There are now many clients who are late in their payments and whose money I will probably never see,'' he said.
The worldwide dimension of the financial crisis, Mr. Figueiredo added, made the outcome even more uncertain. ''We're now in the middle of a crisis that started in American real estate and then crossed over to Europe, and it seems really nobody has any idea where this will go next and for how long.''
Portugal's slump convinced Francois Libner, the president of Libner S.A., a French manufacturer of delivery truck bodies, that it was hopeless to keep trying to sell there.
After growth in Portugal, Greece, Spain, and Italy started to trail off last year, he shifted his focus to Germany. Mr. Libner figures it will take at least a decade for any real growth to return to Southern Europe, particularly in Spain and Greece, which he classifies as ''a catastrophe.''
Mr. Libner said he hoped Paris's efforts to bring the country's deficit and overall debt into line with European rules would allow France to keep its AAA bond rating -- provided that European leaders figure out how to contain the debt crisis to Greece. If that happens, he said, Europe could rebound quickly, as investors regain faith in the viability of the euro union.
But if it does not happen, and Europe's banks become further ensnared in the crisis -- he shuddered at the thought. ''We can pay for Greece, but not for all of Europe,'' he said. If the crisis swells, he added, ''we won't have the means to pay for all of this.''

HEADLINE: Hope Rising, Stores Hire For Holidays

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD

 BODY:
Even with a turbulent economy, leading retailers say they expect to hire more, or at least as many, holiday workers as last year, when temporary hiring for Christmas grew nearly 50 percent over recession lows.
While the numbers are not eye-popping -- Kohl's, for example, said Tuesday it would hire 40,000 people, up 5 percent from last year -- the upbeat plans come against a backdrop of poor growth in permanent jobs, including in the retail sector.
The main reason for the holiday optimism is that people keep shopping. Forecasts issued so far are predicting seasonal sales increases in the range of 2 percent to 3 percent. 
''We expect additional hiring this year given the continued sales growth in our business -- both in-store and online,'' Terry Lundgren, Macy's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement last week. Macy's said it would hire around 78,000 temporary workers, a 4 percent increase from last year.
J. C. Penney said it would hire 35,000 people, up from 30,000, while Target, which hired 92,000 holiday workers last year, expects that number to be slightly higher this year. Saks Fifth Avenue says it would hire about the same number as last year, and a Nordstrom spokesman, Colin Johnson, while declining to discuss specifics, said in an e-mail, ''If we're able to continue to build on our momentum we could have more holiday help this year.''
Wal-Mart, the nation's largest retailer, declined to discuss its holiday hires, as did Sears.
Stores usually begin adding holiday staff in October, though the main growth is in November and December when shopper traffic really picks up. Macy's already is listing dozens of holiday jobs on its careers Web site, from cosmetics sales to restocking.
Target has signs in about 170 of its stores encouraging customers to send a text message to get information about holiday employment. Early response has been encouraging, said Eddie Baeb, a Target spokesman.
But for some jobless people, the lure of holiday employment is a distraction. Harold Jacobs, 54, of Tuckahoe, N.Y., who lost his job at a store nine months ago, said he had no intention of applying for a temporary position.
''I don't want to work for two months and then have to start looking all over again,'' Mr. Jacobs said. ''I want something permanent.''
Still many are applying, and Heidi Shierholz, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute, said there will be real, if short-term, benefits.
''If that's money in their pockets they didn't otherwise have, that's going to be headed right back into the economy on bills and necessities, so that's a positive thing,'' she said. ''The problem is we have persistent high unemployment, and the fact that these particular jobs we're talking about are temporary doesn't make any sort of long-term solution.''
In 2010, about 496,000 temporary workers were hired in the retail sector in November and December, according to the National Retail Federation. That was a 49 percent increase from the prior year, though well below the four years before the recession, when hiring was above 600,000 each year.
Holiday sales in 2010 rose 5.2 percent to $453 billion, according to the trade group, well above the group's prediction of 3.3 percent. The season is the biggest of the year for almost all retailers.
Some specialty stores are hiring fewer employees than last year. Best Buy, which in 2010 hired 29,000 part-time workers, this year will hire just 15,000. The company said in September that consumers were buying less than it had expected, and cut its profit outlook for the year.
Toys ''R'' Us is hiring 40,000 employees, which is 5,000 fewer than in 2010. Those notes of caution are worrisome, Ms. Shierholz said.
''I would hope we would be seeing substantial increases, so the fact that we have to ponder whether or not we're stronger than the extremely weak fourth quarter of 2010 speaks to the weakness of this recovery,'' she said.
The number of full-time workers in retail has improved a tiny bit since last year. The National Retail Federation's economist says retailers have added about 100,000 full-time positions so far this year, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that about 14.57 million people were employed in retailing in August 2011, up about 1 percent from August 2010. But from July to August of this year, there was a 7.8 percent slide in the seasonally adjusted retail employment figures.
Hourly retailing jobs do not tend to be very lucrative. Cashiers have a median wage of $8.89 an hour, and retail sales staff earn a median wage of $9.94, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' 2010 figures. Those both fall below the $11.72 median hourly wage for all sales jobs, and the $16.27 median wage for jobs over all.
And holiday jobs only rarely turn into full-time work, a prospect that has Mr. Jacobs, the unemployed New York retail worker, feeling glum.
Mr. Jacobs was dismissed from his job managing a Manhattan pharmacy about nine months ago.
''I've never had this much trouble finding a job as I have now,'' he said. He has applied at Macy's, Modell's, CVS, Duane Reade, Kmart and Target, and says he posts his resume eight to 10 times a day on Craigslist but has had no luck.
''I get my hopes up a lot of times. I apply places, I think things are going well, and then, nothing,'' said Mr. Jacobs.

HEADLINE: Hiring Locally For Farm Work Is No Cure-All

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
OLATHE, Colo. -- How can there be a labor shortage when nearly one out of every 11 people in the nation are unemployed?
That's the question John Harold asked himself last winter when he was trying to figure out how much help he would need to harvest the corn and onions on his 1,000-acre farm here in western Colorado.
The simple-sounding plan that resulted -- hire more local people and fewer foreign workers -- left Mr. Harold and others who took a similar path adrift in a predicament worthy of Kafka. 
The more they tried to do something concrete to address immigration and joblessness, the worse off they found themselves.
''It's absolutely true that people who have played by the rules are having the toughest time of all,'' said Senator Michael Bennet, a Democrat from Colorado.
Mr. Harold, a 71-year-old Vietnam War veteran who drifted here in the late '60s, has participated for about a decade in a federal program called H-2A that allows seasonal foreign workers into the country to make up the gap where willing and able American workers are few in number. He typically has brought in about 90 people from Mexico each year from July through October.
This year, though, with tough times lingering and a big jump in the minimum wage under the program, to nearly $10.50 hour, Mr. Harold brought in only two-thirds of his usual contingent. The other positions, he figured, would be snapped up by jobless local residents wanting some extra summer cash.
''It didn't take me six hours to realize I'd made a heck of a mistake,'' Mr. Harold said, standing in his onion field on a recent afternoon as a crew of workers from Mexico cut the tops off yellow onions and bagged them.
Six hours was enough, between the 6 a.m. start time and noon lunch break, for the first wave of local workers to quit. Some simply never came back and gave no reason. Twenty-five of them said specifically, according to farm records, that the work was too hard. On the Harold farm, pickers walk the rows alongside a huge harvest vehicle called a mule train, plucking ears of corn and handing them up to workers on the mule who box them and lift the crates, each weighing 45 to 50 pounds.
''It is not an easy job,'' said Kerry Mattics, 49, another H-2A farmer here in Olathe, who brought in only a third of his usual Mexican crew of 12 workers for his 50-acre fruit and vegetable farm, then struggled to make it through the season. ''It's outside, so if it's wet, you're wet, and if it's hot you're hot,'' he said.
Still, Mr. Mattics said, he can't help feeling that people have gotten soft.
''They wanted that $10.50 an hour without doing very much,'' he said. ''I know people with college degrees, working for the school system and only making 11 bucks.''
A mismatch between employers' requirements and the skills and needs of the jobless -- repeated across industries -- has been a constant theme of this recessionary era. But here on the farm, mismatch can mean high anxiety.
The H-2A program, in particular, in trying to avoid displacing American citizens from jobs, strongly encourages farmers to hire locally if they can, with a requirement that they advertise in at least three states. That forces participants to take huge risks in guessing where a moving target might land -- how many locals, how many foreigners -- often with an entire season's revenue at stake. Survival, not civic virtue, drives the equation, they say.
''Farmers have to bear almost all the labor market risk because they must prove no one really was available, qualified or willing to work,'' said Dawn D. Thilmany, a professor of agricultural economics at Colorado State University. ''But the only way to offer proof is to literally have a field left unharvested.''
Mr. Harold's experience is a repeated refrain where farm labor is seasonal and population sparse. And even many immigration hard-liners have come to agree that the dearth of Americans willing to work the fields requires some sort of rethinking, at least, of the H-2A program. Indeed, Representative Lamar Smith of Texas, a conservative Republican, is pushing a bill that would greatly expand the number of foreign guest workers admitted to the country each year.
In Colorado, the unemployment rate in many rural counties is also significantly lower than in the cities -- two neighboring counties here, for example, had 5.5 percent and 6 percent unemployment rates in August, according to state figures, compared with 9.1 percent for the nation as a whole. The big increase in the wage rate for H-2A workers, meanwhile, up nearly $2.50 an hour -- calculated by averaging what farmers had to pay last year -- also suggests that labor demand was already rising.
Mr. Harold usually hires about 50 local workers for the season -- regulars who have worked summers for years -- and most returned this year, he said. Finding new employees was where he ran into trouble. He was able to recover after the season started, he said, by rushing in another group of H-2A workers from Mexico.
But the broader story of labor in agriculture, economists and historians said, is that through good times and bad and across socioeconomic lines, people who find better lives off the farm rarely return. Mr. Harold and other H-2A farmers said that most of the local residents who tried field work this summer, for example, were Hispanic, many of whom, they said, had probably immigrated in years past for agricultural work before taking better-paid jobs in construction or landscaping.
Other farmers left in the lurch by local workers conceded that what they had to offer was a tough sell -- full-time but temporary work. About 56,000 foreign workers came into the country with H-2A visas last year, according to the most recent federal figures, down from 60,000 in 2009.
Heath Terrell is one of the few new local residents who stuck it out. Mr. Terrell, a former hay hauler, was hired to drive a corn truck. That job kept him out of the fields, and out of the sun. Now, as the season has shifted from corn to onions, Mr. Terrell, 42, said he might just stay on with Mr. Harold through the winter, or at least onion season.

HEADLINE: Fiscal and Political Shifts Cloud Stadium Push

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
ARDEN HILLS, Minn. -- For decades, N.F.L. teams, including those in Arizona, Ohio and Texas, have persuaded taxpayers to help them cover most of the costs of their new stadiums. The Minnesota Vikings, whose roof on their current home, the Metrodome, collapsed spectacularly last winter, are no different.
But the Vikings' pitch stands apart from other N.F.L. stadium deals because it is running headlong into a vastly different economic and political landscape. In a state whose financial hardships were so severe that the Legislature shut down state services for several weeks over the summer, a franchise in the $9 billion N.F.L. is asking the public to pay about 60 percent of the cost of a $1.1 billion stadium that would be built here, about 10 miles north of the Twin Cities.
The country's most popular sport is colliding with the country's emergent political philosophy: smaller government and lower taxes. 
''We have to ask whether this is really a good use of the money,'' said King Banaian, one of more than 30 Republicans to join Minnesota's House of Representatives this year and a professor who teaches sports economics at St. Cloud State University. ''Should we be supporting a new stadium over higher education? It's simply not a priority. These deals are, by and large, giveaways to millionaires and billionaires.''
Out of the Vikings' effort over several years to get a new stadium has come the latest in a series of proposals to build the team an indoor facility on the state's largest Superfund site, an abandoned Army munitions plant opened during World War II. The team is offering to pay more than $400 million toward the cost of the stadium, as well as any overruns. It hopes also to get the potentially lucrative rights to develop an adjoining 170 acres, and revenue from any naming rights and personal seat licenses.
In flush times, many politicians might have backed such a project if only to avoid standing in the way of a hometown icon, especially one that could conceivably move to sunnier places, like Los Angeles, which is trying to woo an N.F.L. team.
But these are not flush times, particularly in Minnesota, the home of Representative Michele Bachmann, the Tea Party stalwart. While the Democratic governor and leaders from the Republican-controlled Legislature try to find the votes for the $300 million in state money needed to complete the deal, an alliance of land-use advocates, fiscal conservatives and liberals has joined hands in opposition.
One of them is Chris Coleman, the mayor of St. Paul, who said he opposes the stadium plan because residents in his city would be forced to pay higher sales taxes but not reap the benefits of a stadium in Arden Hills.
''If public participation in the investment made it more affordable for the family to attend the games, I'd be for it,'' he said. ''The economics are really screwy.''
The tug of war over whether to help the Vikings may last through the end of the season, when the team's lease expires at the Metrodome, which opened in 1982. The Vikings say they will not sign a new lease unless there is a deal in place to build them a new home in Arden Hills. (The Twins, who used to play in the Metrodome, signed a series of one-year leases while they waited for their new park to open.)
But a vote on state financing for a new stadium did not come up this summer, when the government was shut down for nearly three weeks as lawmakers tried to close a $5 billion deficit. Gov. Mark Dayton is willing to call a special session this fall, but only if he has enough votes on an amended bill, which he does not appear to have at the moment.
Complicating matters, some Republicans want a referendum on the $350 million contribution from Ramsey County, where the stadium would be situated. Given the public's distaste for higher taxes -- the county hopes to pay for its share by raising the local sales tax by half a cent -- a referendum would probably fail.
Tony Bennett, a Ramsey County commissioner and chief backer of the stadium deal, bemoaned what he said was the stridency of many politicians. He said they failed to see the benefits of turning a toxic eyesore into an income-producing property that would provide thousands of jobs and produce millions of dollars in new taxes.
''It's going to kick-start the economy,'' he said as he gave a tour of the site, which still has telephone lines and fire hydrants, but also land soaked with industrial solvents. ''Too much is in this not to do it.''
Zygi Wilf, the Vikings' principal owner, said he was only asking for equal treatment with the Twins, who moved to Target Field, which was publicly financed. The sum the Vikings are willing to spend on the stadium is among the highest contributions of any N.F.L. team to a new stadium, Wilf said.
The Vikings, he added, generate tens of millions of dollars in taxes that would be lost if the team left, though Wilf has been careful to avoid any talk about moving the team if he does not get a new stadium. Even if he wanted to leave town, the N.F.L., which would have to sign off on any move, prefers that the Vikings stay in Minnesota, where there are avid fans and several key advertisers.
''It's a strong market that has very strong demographics and a very good history,'' said Marc Ganis, the president of SportsCorp, a consultant. ''They've only got one issue: the state is broke and it doesn't want to contribute money.''
That is one reason Wilf has appealed to the community's emotional attachment to the team.
''How many of you have been touched to your fiber at some time in your lives because of the Minnesota Vikings?'' Wilf said during a recent luncheon at the St. Paul Rotary Club, and about two-thirds of the audience raised a hand. ''We realize that we're not just the owners of a proud franchise, but we're really stewards of a franchise for the benefit of all the fans who have been touched by the Minnesota Vikings.''
Wanting to keep the Vikings in Minnesota is one thing; spending scarce dollars to help them build a new stadium is another.
According to a poll by The Star Tribune in May, more than 60 percent of those surveyed said the Vikings should continue playing at the Metrodome and almost three-quarters said public money should not be used to help build a new stadium.
''I think the Vikings franchise can afford the stadium,'' said Carey Goedel, a fan from New Prague who, as a zookeeper, was furloughed during the state shutdown. ''It's not fair to make the general public that might not care about sports pay for it.''
If lawmakers fail to broker a deal, it will not be the first time a team failed to win public concessions. Seattle turned its back on the N.B.A.'s SuperSonics, who left for Oklahoma City soon after. The Rams left California for St. Louis, which offered the team a new, domed stadium. The Colts left Baltimore for greener fields in Indianapolis. Baltimore turned around and lured the Browns to town.
While Wilf said he was focused on getting a deal done in Minnesota, the Vikings would certainly attract interest from other cities. New and bigger stadiums are the currency that fuel sports teams, so, unsurprisingly, the Vikings, who play in an aging facility, are one of the least valuable franchises in the N.F.L. According to Forbes, the team is worth $796 million, 28th among 32 teams. The Vikings barely turned a profit last year, earning $3.7 million in operating income. The Vikings are the fourth most indebted franchise.
Despite the uphill fight to win over legislators, Ted Mondale, the governor's chief negotiator in the stadium debate, said that labor unions, construction companies and corporate executives already back the stadium plan. He emphasized that the stadium would not be corporate welfare and that everything, including naming rights, parking and development rights, was on the table. Opponents need to understand that the state's investment will generate far greater returns, and that the cost of doing nothing would be far worse, he said.
''It's tough to do this in a recession,'' Mondale said. But ''if you lose an N.F.L. team, you look like a loser city.''

HEADLINE: Anticipating a Brutal Fallout: A Chance of Bailouts Ignites Final-Hour U.S. Stock Rally

BYLINE: By JOSHUA BRUSTEIN

 BODY:
A late frenzy on Wall Street led stocks to a sharp increase on Tuesday, even as fears over a major banking crisis in Europe mounted along with expectations that Greece could soon default on its debt.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index spent most of the day in bear market territory, defined as a 20 percent drop from the recent peak. Less than an hour before the close, the index was down 1.9 percent. But in the final 49 minutes of trading it rose 4 percent after a report said European officials were discussing plans to recapitalize the Continent's banks.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed at 1,123.95, up 24.72 points, or 2.25 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 153.41 points, or 1.44 percent, to 10,808.71, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 68.99 points, or 2.95 percent, to 2,404.82. 
Analysts said that while the news from Europe might have been the immediate cause of the rally, the bigger story for the markets was their sustained volatility.
Investors remain jittery as they try to make sense of the debt crisis in Europe, an uncertain economic picture in the United States and a market that has fallen significantly, pushing stocks to levels that seem like bargain prices. In seven of the last 10 trading sessions, the Standard & Poor's index has moved more than 2 percent.
''It's almost a schizophrenic view from investors. Have we fallen off a cliff, or have we hit the bottom?'' said Richard J. Peterson of Standard & Poor's Capital IQ.
The rough ride will end only when some resolution is reached in Europe, Mr. Peterson said. But that day does not seem to be approaching very quickly. There are increasing signs that the economic situation in Europe is set to worsen.
The economy in the 17 countries that use the euro has already slowed to a standstill, and economists say they believe it could stay in a slump at least through the spring. There is widespread worry that austerity measures intended to reduce government debt will further choke Europe's economies.
The price that European governments pay for credit-default swaps, which serve as insurance against default for their sovereign debt, rose sharply across Europe. After the markets closed in New York, Moody's downgraded its outlook on Italian government bonds.
Interest rates rose slightly on Tuesday. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 20/32, to 102 25/32, and the yield rose to 1.82 percent, from 1.75 percent late Monday.
Earlier in Europe, stocks declined sharply. In London, the FTSE 100 index fell 2.58 percent, the DAX in Frankfurt was 2.98 percent lower and the CAC 40 in Paris was down 2.61 percent.
Finance ministers from the 17 European Union nations that use the euro postponed moves to release the next installment of aid to Greece, which means that Greece will probably not receive the 8 billion euros ($10.6 billion) before November.
European banking shares fell sharply, led by Dexia, a financial concern based in Brussels whose value has plunged this week because of its exposure to Greek debt.
Traders pinned the late surge in United States stocks to a report on The Financial Times Web site that European Union finance ministers were looking at ways to reinforce the capital reserves of Europe's banks as part of a broader move to contain the crisis.
Earlier, Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, voiced concern about the American economy when he addressed a Congressional committee. Mr. Bernanke called on Congress to take action on jobs, but also said that the Fed was prepared to make further moves to stimulate the economy. He said the turmoil in the markets was acting as a drag on the American economy.
Analysts noted the negative tone of his remarks.
''We're no longer comparing it to what you would be expecting in a recovery -- it's that we're not as bad as we were in 2008. He talks about the limits of what he can do,'' said Eric Green, chief economist at TD Securities.
In economic data, new factory orders were down slightly in August, but not as bad as most analysts had predicted, according to figures from the Commerce Department.
Andrew Wilkinson, chief economic strategist for Miller Tabak & Company, said that the numbers were the latest in a series of economic indicators showing that the American economy was not slipping into recession. ''It's moving in the right direction, but it's moving at a very slow pace,'' he said.
Still, economists see the slowing economy in Europe as a troublesome sign for the United States. After the 2008 financial crisis, the American economy was fueled in part by exports. Interruptions in worldwide demand could cut off that road to recovery. A strengthening dollar could also be a concern, because it makes American exports more expensive.
The dollar rose to a fresh nine-month high against the euro, which fell as low as $1.3144, before recovering to $1.332.

HEADLINE: No Christie, No Bargain

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey isn't going to run. That's too bad. He had a chance to rescue the Republican Party from its dash to the cliff and make President Obama a better leader, too.
Here's why: When the G.O.P. presidential candidates were asked during their debate on Aug. 11 whether any of them would accept a budget deal that involved $10 in spending cuts for every $1 in tax increases -- and they all said no -- the Republican Party officially became a danger to itself and to the country. 
The G.O.P. became a danger to the country because it announced, in effect, that it would not be a partner for the kind of Grand Bargain that many economists believe we need -- something that provides more near-term investment in the economy that spurs job growth, combined with a credible long-term plan to increase tax revenues and trim entitlements so the country's debt-to-G.D.P. ratio stays in a safe range. Such a Grand Bargain would simultaneously boost the economy and optimism by its economic logic and the mere fact of the two parties working together.
The G.O.P. became a danger to itself because, as Tyler Cowen, an economics professor at George Mason University, pointed out in this newspaper on Sunday: ''Cutting $10 in spending for every $1 in tax increases would result in $9 in net tax reduction. That's because lower spending today means lower taxes tomorrow, and limiting the future path of government spending does limit future taxes, as Milton Friedman, the late Nobel laureate and conservative icon, so clearly explained. Promising never to raise taxes, without reaching a deal on spending, really means a high and rising commitment to future taxes.''
The G.O.P.'s refusal to contemplate any tax increase, added Cowen, ''has brought what seems to be an extreme Democratic response: President Obama's latest budget plan is moving away from entitlement reform and embracing multiple tax increases on the wealthy. We may be left with no good fiscal options.''
Indeed, Obama's decision to respond to G.O.P. extremism and the failure to conclude a Grand Bargain, by moving to the left rather than to the center, was a huge mistake. It means, as Cowen noted, that the country has no credible, long-term fiscal option before it now. Rather than shift back to his base with a weak fiscal plan, Obama should have taken his idea of a Grand Bargain to the country.
Many Americans understand that we are on the wrong track and, I believe, will support a big plan if it: 1) addresses our problem at the scale that is required; 2) shares the burden of cutbacks fairly -- takes from defense programs and entitlements and asks the wealthy to pay more but everyone to pay something; 3) has a lofty goal to restore American greatness, not just get us through this crisis; 4) lays out an honest time horizon. This will take time.
In an essay last week in The Washington Post, the co-chairmen of the president's fiscal commission, Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles, made exactly this point about their plan to cut the debt by $3.9 trillion by 2020 -- through raising tax revenues, cutting defense and increasing the age at which people would qualify for Social Security and Medicare. ''When we presented our co-chairmen's proposal to the rest of the fiscal commission in November,'' they wrote, ''Washington insiders were shocked that we so aggressively exceeded our mandate. They were sure that the proposal would need to be scaled back to get a majority vote. It turned out that the opposite was true. The more comprehensive we made it, the easier our job became. The tougher our proposal, the more people came aboard. Commission members were willing to take on their sacred cows and fight special interests -- but only if they saw others doing the same and if what they were voting for solved the country's problems. ...We would not have garnered that type of support had we not taken on defense, domestic programs, the solvency of Social Security, health care, and spending in the tax code all at once.''
By refusing to embrace Simpson-Bowles as the basis of a Grand Bargain, and instead offering a watered-down version, Obama has left a gap for a sane Republican or independent candidate. Why was Christie popular among G.O.P. moderates and independents? Because he seemed ready to tell hard truths that Obama has started to shrink from. Had Christie -- a moderate on gun control, climate change and immigration who has also backed Simpson-Bowles -- run and won significant support, he would have forced Obama back to the center.
Then, instead of a race between the Democratic left and the Republican right -- in which the whole country would lose because the winner would not have had a mandate for the real change we need -- we would have had a race between the Democratic center, independents and the Republican center. Then the whole country would win. Because whoever captured the presidency would have a mandate to actually implement some version of the Grand Bargain needed to get growth going again -- and growth is the only sustainable cure for unemployment, the deficit and inequality.

HEADLINE: Friendly's Files for Chapter 11

BYLINE: DEALBOOK


HIGHLIGHT: The chain, citing a weak economy, will close 63 restaurants. 

 BODY:
The Friendly's fast-food and ice cream chain filed for bankruptcy protection on Wednesday and said that it would close 63 restaurants.
The company said it hoped to restructure quickly under section 363 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code. An affiliate of its current owners, Sun Capital Partners, will act as a "stalking horse" bidder, to set the floor for bids for Friendly's. The company has secured $70 million in debtor in possession financing. 
Sun Capital, a private equity firm based in Boca Raton, Fla., acquired Friendly's for $337.2 million in 2007. Sun Capital, known for its work in turnaround situations, has experience with retail and consumer companies in bankruptcies.
 The Chapter 11 filing, in United States Bankruptcy Court in Delaware, estimates liabilities of $100 million to $500 million. The federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation and Bank of New York Mellon, which holds $7.8 million in senior subordinate notes, are listed as its top creditors. 
The company said the bankruptcy filing "was driven largely by the challenges of the current economic downturn." It also pointed to increased costs for cream, among other expenses.
Friendly's was founded in 1935 in Springfield, Mass. The company said 424 restaurants would be open for business as usual.

HEADLINE: Oct. 5, 1947 | President Truman Uses First TV Address to Ask Americans to Conserve Food

BYLINE: THE LEARNING NETWORK


HIGHLIGHT: On Oct. 5, 1947, in the first televised White House address, President Harry S. Truman asked Americans to refrain from eating meat on Tuesdays, and poultry and eggs on Thursdays, to help stockpile grain for starving people in Europe. 

 BODY:
On Oct. 5, 1947, in the first televised White House address, President Harry S. Truman and several cabinet members, including Secretary of State George C. Marshall, asked Americans to refrain from eating meat on Tuesdays, and poultry and eggs on Thursdays, to help stockpile grain for starving people in Europe.
The New York Times reported the next day that the goal was to create a surplus of grain which, instead of being used to feed animals, could provide emergency food relief to Europe: "Food from the United States," Secretary Marshall said, "would deter the march of hunger, cold and collapse, not only enabling Europe to recover its economic stability, but also contributing to the resolution of a crisis that could mean the difference between the failure or attainment of world peace and security."

The program did not have a long-term effect on the European food crisis. Even President Truman's secretary of agriculture, Clinton Anderson, admitted a day before the speech that the program was mostly a "symbol of sacrifice" that would "get the public in the frame of mind to conserve food."
The program was part of America's large-scale postwar relief effort in Europe, preceding the passage of the Marshall Plan, which provided $13 billion in aid from 1948 to 1951 and had a more lasting effect on Europe's recovery. 
Connect to Today:
The Food Prices and Supply Times Topic discusses the contributing factors of today's high food prices. Its overview notes, "[I]n 2008, food riots broke out in developing countries around the world, as the prices of staples, particularly rice, jumped sharply" and that "some food experts thought the increases could have been a factor in the unrest that swept the Arab world in early 2011."
Most of the efforts to control the rising costs of food worldwide have focused on increasing food supply rather than reducing consumption. Do you think it is possible for people, particularly in the United States, to reduce their consumption or to make other changes for the common good? Why or why not?

HEADLINE: The Long Stagnation

BYLINE: DAVID BROOKS AND GAIL COLLINS


HIGHLIGHT: Whether it's riots in Athens, denial in Berlin or protests on Wall Street, the political and cultural effects of the financial crisis continue to reverberate. 

 BODY:
David Brooks: Let me start with the smaller tragedy before I get to the larger one. Gov. Chris Christie will not be running for president. To me this means he will never be president. Those who hesitate the first time they have a chance to run, never win later on.
Gail Collins: Unless you happen to be the son of a president, the rule seems to be that you have to run unsuccessfully but manically, and then, after you lose, devote the next several years to wandering around looking eligible. Then and only then are you ripe for picking.
David Brooks: Well, it's a shame because I wanted to have the fat debate. Many of our colleagues (not in The Times, but elsewhere) wrote that Christie was too obese to be elected. Personally, I don't think people should be condemned or judged for things that are largely genetic, but apparently some pundits disagree. 
Gail Collins: I always like to tell the story about a very trim and athletic Republican who ran for Senate against Ted Kennedy during one of Kennedy's fat periods, running ads that showed Kennedy trying to squeeze himself behind a table. That would have been Mitt Romney. The Kennedy people got some workers who had been downsized out of their jobs in one of Romney's Bain Capital takeovers, and Mitt was destroyed by his own lust for thinness. 
David Brooks: Let me turn to my larger topic. Picture me as the world's psychological weatherman. Imagine me, in other words, in a loud print sport-jacket at the tail end of the evening news giving the five-day forecast of the world's emotional trends. I start, standing in front of my green screen by gesturing over at Europe. Notice the black cloud of gloom and denial stretching across the continent, with an epicenter around Greece, but expanding rapidly across the Mediterranean and up into Germany and France.
Ireland is looking oddly brighter, but when you glance across the Atlantic you see a heavy fog of fear and despair socked in over Wall Street. Washington is completely enshrouded by pessimism and foul-tempered lethargy. All across the United States there is a putrid yellow layer of ill feeling. 
Can you remember a time when the entire Western world was in such a funk?
Gail Collins: Right, when the first tremors began to hit Ireland, I noticed a perverse cheer across the land, like: "See, I knew this was all a farce." There's nobody happier than the Irish when their worst suspicions about human nature have been confirmed.
David Brooks: Back in 2008 there was at least a tingle of newness about the financial crisis. There was the sensation of raw terror, the excitement of living through something historic. Now, the gloom is just sitting on top of us. People everywhere are coming to the realization that the economic hard times are probably going to last another several years. The political stasis may be with us at least that long too.
Gail Collins: Is it O.K. with you if I insist that there could very well be an upturn? I'm going to hope for the best while shopping my new book proposal: "Seventy Great Ways to Serve Squirrel."
David Brooks: If only Mike Huckabee owned a publishing house. 
But what are the political and cultural effects of this long stagnation? So far, they have been oddly muted. There have been riots in Greece and London. There is denial in Berlin and Paris. There is the Tea Party and now there are these people occupying Wall Street or the Brooklyn Bridge, whichever has better Wi-Fi service. I personally am not too impressed by the Wall Street occupiers so far. The Tea Party has tens of millions of followers. There's no indication yet that the Wall Street protesters can boast anything like those numbers.
Gail Collins: It's two different things entirely. The Tea Party, whatever it pretends, is just the latest manifestation of the right wing's refusal to accept the idea of Democrats running the government. Every time one gets elected, there's this crazed right-wing upheaval. The Wall Street protests are a cry of pain from a generation that feels it's been cheated, and for good reason. But the one thing I learned from my own misspent youth is that a movement without any clear political principles is better at producing music than change. 
David Brooks: Which is not to say some movement could not yet arise. Hostility toward China could grow. Some form of populism could still upset the Romney-Obama matchup that I think is the likely presidential race. It's worth remembering that we are far more likely to have a negative surprise over the next year than a positive one. European banks could tumble. Rising food prices could cause even more turmoil in the developing world. I'm sort of interested in all the recent college grads who have no prayer of paying off their loans and no way to get out of them. 
Gail Collins: Particularly when the students coming after them are getting better deals on their loans, thanks to the Obama reforms. I want to see an uprising of the last generation of college grads, demanding their debt be restructured like their younger siblings'. Now there would be a movement that could get some traction.
David Brooks: I hover between two sentiments. First, that there's not much that can be done to avert seven or eight years of stagnation. Financial crises are like that. They stink. Alternatively, that future historians will nonetheless look back on today's leaders, of both parties and on both sides of the Atlantic and regard them with the same disdain we now use when viewing the generals of World War I. They will be regarded as people who couldn't even grasp the forces that gripped them, people who couldn't bring their mentalities up to date, people locked into old battles, and too beholden to old economic models.
Gail Collins: I could argue that Obama's long-term legacy will depend on how health care reform works out and controls medical costs. Or that the future historians may focus on things we're not thinking much about now, like the administration's foreign policy. But you're in a Brooksian funk today and I don't want to cheer you up unnecessarily.
David Brooks: I wish I'd bought gold back when Glenn Beck first told me to.

HEADLINE: World Monuments Fund Places Manufacturers Hanover Building on At-Risk List

BYLINE: ROBIN POGREBIN


HIGHLIGHT: Along with the New York modernist landmark, 65 other sites were placed on the 2102 World Monuments Watch, a list of endangered cultural heritage sites across the globe. 

 BODY:
The 1954 glass box at 510 Fifth Avenue is among the cultural heritage sites at risk, according to the annual list assembled by the World Monuments Fund, which was released on Wednesday. Noting that the controversial renovation of the building at 43rd Street, a branch of what was then the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company, has been the subject of a court dispute, the fund said the case "raises questions about the legality of recent alterations and the capacity of the New York City Landmarks Commission to enforce protective regulations."
The Landmarks Preservation Committee has said it has made reasonable accommodations for a developer who needs to make the building economically viable but is otherwise restoring several of the building's historical elements. 
Among the other 66 sites on the 2012 World Monuments Watch - which include 41 countries and territories - were Charleston, S.C.; the First Cemetery of Athens; and floating fishing villages in Vietnam's Ha Long Bay.
"The World Monuments Watch is a call to action on behalf of endangered cultural heritage sites across the globe," Bonnie Burnham, the fund's president, said in a statement. "And while these sites are historic, they are also very much of the present - integral parts of the lives of the people who come into contact with them every day."
At a news conference at its Empire State Building headquarters, the fund also said that American Express, the founding sponsor of the World Monuments Watch, has made a new grant of $5 million to support the program over the next five years.

HEADLINE: When Times Get Tough, the Elderly Work

BYLINE: CASEY B. MULLIGAN


HIGHLIGHT: The elderly worked more than many other groups during the recession, perhaps because they were able to keep more of their earnings, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
 
The elderly are one group whose work hours now exceed what they were before the recession began. This pattern is most evident in the most depressed regions of the United States.
The recession has varied in different regions of the United States. In some areas - including Arizona, California, Florida, Hawaii, and Nevada - housing prices surged more dramatically in the early part of the 2000s than they did in the rest of America, and their economies fell hard when housing prices collapsed.
One view is that such areas experienced a deeper recession because their banks became overwhelmed with defaults and were unable or unwilling to make new loans to consumers and businesses. Without those new loans, demand collapsed more than it did nationwide, and jobs were especially difficult to find, even while people living in the area were especially eager to work.
Absent demand, just about all workers will have a tough time retaining a job or finding a new one.
Another view is that old loans are the problem, not newer ones. A significant fraction of households and businesses are typically so burdened with the debts they accumulated during the housing surge that they have little incentive to produce and work, because their creditors would get most, if not all, of the fruits of their labor.

In contrast to the no-new-loans-and-no-demand theory, old loans do not affect all workers; some are less burdened by debt. The elderly may fall in this category, because they are more likely to have saved money over their lifetimes and to have paid off their mortgages. Although some elderly working for debt-burdened employers may have lost jobs, on average the elderly in these areas should be working more because they have better incentives to do so.
The chart below compares 2007-10 changes in work hours for two areas -- the regions where housing prices rose and fell the most, on the left side of the chart, and the rest of the United States on the right. For middle-aged and younger people (blue bars), hours worked fell 12 percent in the large cycle regions and about 9 percent in the rest of the United States.
Hours worked by elderly people increased in both regions.
As I noted a few weeks ago, the average American elderly person worked more in 2010 than did the average elderly person before the recession began, even while work hours were down sharply for middle-aged and young people. The chart above shows that this is true even in the states that generally experienced the largest collapse during this recession.
Demand is not the only factor driving employment patterns.

HEADLINE: Back Home, and Homeless

BYLINE: MATT FARWELL


HIGHLIGHT: A soldier who came back from Afghanistan in April 2007 has been out of the Army for 18 months, and homeless for 16 of them. 

 BODY:
Mid-June, 2011: I find myself alone in a dark wooded park tucked between million-dollar houses south of Stanford University, looking for a spot in the bushes to stash my bags. Until that morning I'd been living in a cheap weekly-rate motel in Palo Alto. Before checkout, knowing I couldn't afford the $48 fee for another night, I laid out my stuff on the bed. Over the cigarette burns on threadbare sheets, I scrounged for quarters, dimes and nickels. There was enough for an extra value meal at Taco Bell. I divided everything else I had between three bags; an olive-drab backpack my brother used in the Army Rangers, a black duffel I bought at Goodwill and a satchel for my laptop. 
This was my life. I was two weeks shy of my 28th birthday, unemployed, broke, thousands of miles from my family, watching the weather forecast to see how uncomfortable sleeping outside would be that night. Whatever the prediction, I could handle it. Four and a half years in the Army, including 16 months as an infantryman in eastern Afghanistan, provided plenty of skills with no legal application in the civilian world. It was, however, wonderful preparation for being homeless.
I was searching for a hole in the bushes to hide my bags. They were heavy and awkward, cumbersome to lug around Palo Alto. They clashed with the mishmash of designer bags embroidered with labels from Silicon Valley tech companies that the Stanford kids carried. Walking with them, I stood out, the opening scene of the first Rambo movie cycling through my mind: Sylvester Stallone on the side of the road with a big, green duffel bag slung over his shoulder and blending in with every part of his faded green field jacket except the red, white and blue flag patch, attracts the attention of the sheriff who wants John Rambo and all the bad mojo he carries from Vietnam out of his town. That movie ended badly for Rambo, the sheriff and the town. My life wasn't a movie and I wasn't John Rambo, but the same possibilities for a bad ending loomed. I'd learned that fact the only way fools like me learn anything: experience. 
As infantry on the ground in Afghanistan, we were introduced to the ugliness of violent, unpredictable death. Over the 16 months of our tour, we caused it and we endured it; we grew well acquainted with it. Sometimes I think that we took it back, an invisible scythe-carrying stowaway on board the airplane we took back to the States. How else to explain my friend Michael Cloutier, whose spot-on shooting probably saved my life when our observation post was attacked by Taliban who outnumbered us three to one, dying of a drug overdose a year after we came back? 
Or the staff sergeant from my former battalion -- Second Battalion, 87th Infantry Regiment, Third Brigade, Tenth Mountain Division -- who committed suicide by cop on Fort Drum later that year when military police were called to investigate a domestic disturbance? I didn't know him that well and had already left Fort Drum for a cushy assignment as an assistant in a four-star general's headquarters, but I wrote the eulogy my old company commander delivered at his funeral. 
Not too long after that, when my friends in my old unit were rotating back, I started to crack a bit. That year the Taliban killed two of my friends, Staff Sgt. Esau I. DeLaPena-Hernandez, 25, and Sgt. Carlie M. Lee III, 23. The next year a helicopter crash killed my brother, Chief Warrant Officer Gary Marc Farwell. As my last real duty in the Army, I escorted his body home from Germany, wearing a dress uniform and saluting his casket in Atlanta and Salt Lake City as it was loaded and unloaded from the commercial airliner. 
None of this was on my mind that night in Palo Alto. I just wanted to stash my bags and get some sleep, if I could. I had a plan. I wrapped the bags in a space blanket to keep the books and clothes inside dry, then wrapped it in a camouflage, Army-issue poncho liner to keep them concealed. After I stashed them in the bushes and saved the location on the G.P.S. that also held grid coordinates for Firebases and Combat Outposts I had manned in Afghanistan, I set off with my satchel, bound for Stanford and their 24-hour library. 
It was finals time and short of a T.S.A. inspection at the library entrance, no one would know that under my laptop, iPad, chargers, batteries, pens, paperback books and notepads were my hobo essentials: a Ziploc with a small hygiene kit, deodorant, a pair of underwear and a change of socks. Wearing a polo shirt and a pair of khakis, I could blend in, hide out and hopefully get a little sleep in the once-familiar environment -- an American college campus -- that, like my country, now felt so foreign and hostile.
Paul Rieckhoff, a veteran of Operation Iraqi Freedom and the founder and chairman of Iraq & Afghanistan Veterans of America testified that over 11,000 veterans between the ages of 18 and 30 were officially listed - that is, somehow identified, confirmed and entered in the Department of Veteran's Affairs database - as homeless. That's more than a standard Army division. It's also really tricky to measure exactly, since there are plenty, like me, you'd never suspect were homeless veterans if you saw them around town.
The law, "United States Code Title 42, Chapter 119, Subchapter 1," essentially defines a homeless person as somebody with no stable bed or shelter. If you live in a box under the bridge, this counts. If you live in a state- or church-funded homeless shelter, this counts. If you are an inpatient for some sort of medical or psychiatric condition, this counts. Also, if you're somewhere in between: couch surfing, living in a series of cheap motels, staying with your parents for an extended period of time, that counts. By the definition of the law, I've been homeless for about 16 months. To put that in perspective, I've been out of the Army for about 18 months. 
I'm still not sure how I got there. Before Afghanistan, I was no saint but I generally kept out of trouble. No trouble with the law beyond a handful of tickets for speeding and parking. I was a healthy and an absurdly well-educated striver. My resume lists Eagle Scout, Davis Scholar, Echols Scholar and National Merit Finalist alongside the Combat Infantryman's Badge, Army Commendation Medals and Parachutist wings. With the exception of the last year, which I have spent unemployed, attending one semester of college while recuperating from a spinal injury and trying to write, my work experience is unbroken since I landed my first job at 15; soldier, SAT & G.R.E. tutor, defense contracting intern, plumbing guy at Lowe's, waiter and lifeguard. I try to gloss over the multiple arrests and hospitalizations after the war and highlight my hope to return to the college I dropped out of once my head gets screwed on a little straighter.
Part of the reason I came to California was to heal and figure out why my life seemed determined to come unglued. Blaming it on the war, the things I'd seen and done there, seems a cop-out and a clich, but maybe there's something to it. Jonathan Shay, a psychiatrist with the Veterans Administration who earned a MacArthur Genius Grant for his work on behalf of vets, wrote that combat post-traumatic stress disorder is "a war injury."
"Veterans with combat PTSD are war wounded, carrying the burdens of sacrifice for the rest of us as surely as the amputees, the burned, the blind and the paralyzed carry them," he wrote. The Palo Alto V.A. was one of the best in the country, I'd heard, and their psychiatric division in Menlo Park, near Facebook's new headquarters, had one of the best programs for treating guys like me, so I was waiting to get in. 
That night in June, though, I was on my own. I walked down to Greene Library, took a spot on a couch in the corner, unpacked my laptop and carefully set up my workspace. I used the bathroom, washed my hands, rolled a cigarette and walked outside to bum a light from a stressed-out student. I inhaled, exhaled and saw the sky. Looking at the stars, I laughed and coughed, the honest part of me wishing I was still in Afghanistan. 
Memories (bad, good and indifferent) of four and a half years wearing the uniform, a third of that in combat, occupy psychic space next to deeply ingrained habits, skills and instinctive reactions that, like all things war-related, are double-edged back home: they helped keep me alive and sane amid the boredom, ennui, confused terror and brief moments of adrenaline-fueled elation of combat - a euphoric sense of zen-like calm and focus that's better than any drug I've ever tried or heard about - but they've been doing their damnedest to kill me and my friends since we got back.

HEADLINE: Plans Announced for Movie Museum in Los Angeles

BYLINE: MICHAEL CIEPLY


HIGHLIGHT: The motion picture academy is joining with a Los Angeles county art museum to develop a museum that will showcase the movie industry, though under scaled-back plans and in an existing building rather than a grandiose new one. 

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES - The movies may finally get their museum, just not as flashy a one as originally planned.
Scaling back an earlier proposal to build a landmark building in this city's Hollywood district, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences said on Tuesday night it would join with the Los Angeles County Museum of Art to develop a museum that may inhabit part of the art museum's existing complex in the mid-Wilshire area.
In a joint statement, the academy and the county museum described a plan to negotiate contracts and begin fundraising efforts to open the museum in L.A.C.M.A. West, a former department store that currently houses office space and occasional exhibits.
They did not disclose the expected cost of the new museum, or the amount of the academy's expected contribution. But Tom Sherak, the academy's president, Dawn Hudson, its chief executive, and Michael Govan, the art museum's chief executive, described on Wednesday a facility that will require much less than the anticipated $400 million cost of the Hollywood project, though it will have more exhibition space.
"It's actually bigger," Mr. Sherak said of a museum that will be housed in a 300,000 square-foot space that once was home to a May Company department store.
The new museum could be open in three to five years, if negotiations and fundraising remain on track, Mr. Sherak said..
The current plan follows the collapse of an ambitious attempt by the film academy, which has about 6,000 members drawn from Hollywood's professional ranks, to built a huge, free-standing museum that would showcase the history and craftsmanship of motion pictures. The new structure was to have adjoined its existing Mary Pickford Center for Motion Picture Study, on Vine St., near Sunset Blvd.
In 2007, the academy hired the French architect Christian de Portzamparc, a former winner of the Pritzker Architecture Prize, to design a grandiose center that was described by some academy officials as being comparable in scope to the Frank Gehry-designed Walt Disney Concert Hall in downtown Los Angeles. Like the Disney Hall, the museum was intended to help revive the urban neighborhood in which it nested.
But that plan fell apart, as a long-drawn writers strike in 2007 and a subsequent collapse in the financial world diminished fundraising prospects. And the pullback left the academy holding several blocks of newly purchased land that has been publicly estimated to cost $45 million, though much of its value was almost immediately lost in the real estate downturn.
Under the arrangement agreed to Tuesday night, the county museum will lease space and provide guidance for the movie museum, but the academy will own and control the project, and will establish an endowment for its support.
"I think everybody realizes that the great art of the 20th Century is film," Mr. Govan said of his institution's interest in becoming associated with a museum that reaches beyond the fine arts, into popular culture. Recently, L.A.C.M.A. has hosted a major exhibition of artwork by the film director Tim Burton, and will build an exhibit around the work of another director, Stanley Kubrick, next year, Mr. Govan said.
Ms. Hudson said the new museum would include both newly gathered collections, and material drawn from 42,000 movie posters and 10 million movie photographs that are mostly locked away in the academy's archives.
As of June 30, 2010, the academy's last published annual report showed that it had about $258.6 million in net assets and investments of about $187 million.
Almost all of the group's income comes from an annual Oscar show that takes in about $80 million annually, and in recent years has cost about $33 million to produce. Structured as a nonprofit, the academy funds various archives and a library devoted to the movie world, and it has scattered grants among film festivals and education programs.
But it has long been building a nest-egg, much of which was earmarked years ago for the development of a museum that has been intended as a focal point of not just Hollywood culture, but world film.
For the city of Los Angeles, the new museum would strengthen a mid-city corridor that is already known as Museum Row, for a concentration of exhibition spaces that stretches across it. As for Mr. Portzamparc's design, commissioned at a cost of more than $300,000, according to one of the academy's financial filings, Mr. Sherak said it is not entirely off the table.
"Do you want to buy it?" he said. "The fundraising begins today."

HEADLINE: Coverage Grows for Wall Street Protest

BYLINE: BRIAN STELTER


HIGHLIGHT: As the Occupy Wall Street protests have spread to other cities in recent days, there has been a surge in media coverage on television, online and in print. 

 BODY:
"Live, from Occupy Wall Street."
The Occupy Wall Street protesters and people sympathetic to their movement accused mainstream media outlets of playing down the first days of their protests in New York City in September.
But as the protests have spread to other cities in recent days, there has been a surge in media coverage on television, online and in print. And on Wednesday, for the first time, a national television news program moved itself to Lower Manhattan to cover the protests at length.
The program was that of Tamron Hall, the 2 p.m. anchor on MSNBC. Standing beside Zuccotti Park, the focal point of the Occupy Wall Street protests, Ms. Hall said that "protests are being held and planned right now in more than 50 cities." On the screen were videos of earlier protests in New York, Chicago, Boston and Los Angeles.
There are no immediate plans for other programs on MSNBC to broadcast from the protest site. Still, the presence of Ms. Hall attests to the growing amount of media attention that the protests are garnering.

While there were reporters at the park on Sept. 17, the first day of the occupation, there are many more now.
There were only a smattering of mentions of the protests on television in the first week, and some of those mentions - like the first one on Current TV's "Countdown," the liberal program anchored by Keith Olbermann - were about the lack of media coverage.
Television regulars like Michael Moore helped spur some coverage in late September. The Pew Research Center's Project for Excellence in Journalism found that the protests represented a small sliver of the national news hole last week: the economy accounted for 14 percent of news coverage, and Occupy Wall Street accounted for about 12 percent of that economic coverage.
Arrests of protesters on two consecutive Saturdays, Sept. 24 and Oct. 1, generated much more coverage, including reports on nightly newscasts. By the time the protests entered a third workweek on Monday, all of the network morning news shows were discussing them.
"In a matter of weeks, Occupy Wall Street has grown from a small group of protesters squatting in New York's Zuccotti Park to a national movement," Mr. Olbermann said on his program Tuesday night. "Support from organized labor and progressive groups is increasing by the day, while the protesters - who were once sneered at by most national media and The New York Times - are now part of the testimony on Capitol Hill, part of the conversation on the campaign trail, and part of the calculations on Wall Street."
The proximity of the main Occupy Wall Street protest to the newsrooms of television networks and national newspapers may have helped draw coverage. Erin Burnett, a new anchor for CNN, visited the park, interviewed protesters and showed one of the interviews on her program with a heavy dose of sarcasm on Monday night.
In a separate segment, Ms. Burnett told one of her guests, "I was in Tahrir Square during the Egyptian revolution, and this lacked the intensity, to say the least."
Others seem to disagree.
When Nick Kristof, a columnist for The New York Times, visited the park on Sept. 29, he wrote on Twitter, "I've just been interviewing people at the Occupy Wall Street protests. Reminds me of Tahrir Square." Mr. Kristof, too, was in Egypt during the revolution there, and he said he saw similarities in the "social media savvy, carnival mood and deep sense of frustration & disenfranchisement" of both crowds.
Dylan Ratigan, an afternoon MSNBC anchor who rails against what he calls financial and governmental corruption, has spent time at the park each day since Sept. 30, and spoke with Ms. Hall on her show on Wednesday. He sent an e-mail to fellow journalists on Tuesday that read, "If you haven't been down to Zuccotti Park I highly recommend it. Not to simply get crowd shots, but to actually meet and talk with some of these people who are of all kinds, ages and economic standings."
He has not yet broadcast his daily TV show from the park, however.

HEADLINE: Study Says Higher-Wage Bill for City Projects Would Cost Jobs

BYLINE: KATE TAYLOR


HIGHLIGHT: A study of a City Council proposal to increase pay for workers on city-subsidized projects has added fuel to the debate over the measure. 

 BODY:
A proposal that would require companies to pay higher wages on city-subsidized projects would result in a loss of jobs, according to the final version of a long-awaited study of the proposal released by the city's economic development agency.
The study (see also below) says that in cities where similar measures have been adopted, modest wage gains have been offset by a decrease in employment among low-skilled workers of about 2.2 percent. Based on that finding, the study predicts that the bill being considered by the City Council would result in the loss of 6,000 to 13,000 low-skilled jobs.
An earlier version of the study, which was commissioned by the Economic Development Corporation, was harshly criticized as biased by advocates of the so-called living-wage proposal. Both Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and business leaders have opposed the measure, arguing it would cost the city jobs. 
The study's release follows an announcement earlier this week by the bill's advocates that they would introduce revisions to the bill that are intended to make it less onerous by excluding manufacturing firms and small businesses from the wage requirement.
The proposed bill, which was originally introduced last year by two Bronx Council members, G. Oliver Koppell and Annabel Palma, would require that employees working in city-subsidized projects be paid $10 an hour with benefits, or $11.50 an hour without benefits. The minimum wage is $7.25 an hour. 
The bill has the support of a majority of the City Council, along with a coalition of labor leaders, antipoverty advocates, and clergy, who cite recent Census Bureau data showing that the city's poverty rate had risen to 20 percent as a reason why the proposal is crucial.
The Economic Development Corporation described the study, which it paid a Boston consulting firm nearly $1 million to conduct, as the most significant study to date on wage mandates. Among the study's other findings, it predicted that the living wage bill would reduce real estate development. Over 20 years, it found, it would result in a loss of $7 billion in private real estate investment and as many as 100,000 jobs.
A spokeswoman for Mr. Bloomberg on Tuesday night reiterated the administration's opposition to the bill. 
"This study shows clearly that while wage mandates may raise income for a few, they also result in significant job losses and reduced private investment for many," the spokeswoman, Julie Wood, said in an e-mail. "We'll review any proposed legislation when it's introduced, but this Administration is working to make it easier to create jobs in New York City, not harder."
Stuart Appelbaum, president of the union Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, which has organized a coalition of groups supporting the living wage measure, decried the study.
"This is a desperate attempt to derail much-needed living wage legislation that many thousands of New Yorkers have been urging the City Council to pass," Mr. Appelbaum said in a statement. "Instead of investing in the creation of good jobs, the mayor continues to waste taxpayer money on pathetic propaganda that was discredited months ago."
And the report was also lambasted by Comptroller John C. Liu, who is expected to run for mayor in 2013.
"This million dollar report is so flawed it's not worth the bandwidth for a download,'' he said in a statement. "The proposed living wage would be a requirement on new projects that are heavily subsidized by taxpayers and would create new jobs that pay decent wages. The claim of job losses is rhetoric at its worst."

HEADLINE: Assailed for Subprime Loans, Capital One Defends ING Deal

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: Two contrasting images of Capital One -- subprime credit card company or benevolent bank -- were presented at a hearing on its planned acquisition of ING Direct USA. 

 BODY:
Subprime lender or benevolent bank? 
The two contrasting images of Capital One vied for attention on Wednesday at a hearing in San Francisco before the Federal Reserve, which is examining the bank's proposed $9 billion takeover of ING Direct USA.
To hear many consumer advocates tell it, Capital One is an aggressive credit card company that preys on low-income borrowers. And if Capital One takes over ING's online banking unit in the United States, critics say, the combined banks will pose a systemic risk to the economy. 
 "Is the Federal Reserve really prepared to turn a blind eye again and watch a new subprime crisis unfold?" Ed Gorman, chief membership officer at the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, said in written testimony to the Fed, which hosted the third and final public hearing to scrutinize the deal. "Capital One's risky and subprime credit cards generate stellar earnings three times the size of their asset base through predatory interest rates, questionable fees and confusing terms."
That is not the case, Capital One's lawyers say. 
"Our products are the most customer-friendly and transparent in the industry," John Finneran, Capital One's general counsel, told the Fed. "Given the size of this market, responsible lending to these borrowers is not only acceptable, but also provides a source of credit and purchasing power for these customers, and is thus necessary to the functioning of our economy." 
Still, Mr. Finneran acknowledged that about a third of Capital One's credit card portfolio carries the subprime label, defined as loans to borrowers with credit scores below 660. The bank also has a heavy hand in the subprime car loan business.
In June, Capital One announced plans to acquire ING Direct USA for $6.2 billion in cash. Under the terms of the deal, Capital One would also issue $2.8 billion worth of new shares to ING, giving the Dutch firm a 9.9 percent stake.
The deal would make Capital One the fifth-biggest bank in the United States, up from its current No. 8 spot. 
The jump, critics warn, comes with plenty of risk. Capital One has received a steady barrage of complaints from consumer groups and smaller banks, which warn that the takeover would create another "too big to fail" financial giant.
Under the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory overhaul, the Fed must examine whether major bank mergers would endanger the economy. When the risks outweigh the rewards, the Fed must block the deal.
Unlike past hearings, when Fed officials were mostly mum on the ING Direct deal, some regulators on Wednesday seized on questions surrounding Capital One's subprime loan business. One Fed official asked whether Capital One's $2.6 billion bid for HSBC's American credit card business would deepen the bank's entrenchment in the subprime market. 
"It won't change the overall proportions in a significant way in either direction," Mr. Finneran said. 
Some consumer groups think otherwise. "The subprime number will only get bigger," said Mr. Gorman of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition.
With the hearings wrapping up on Wednesday, the fate of the ING Direct deal is now in the Fed's hands. Capital One likes its chances.
"The Federal Reserve has all the data regarding the scope and performance of our businesses and can distinguish between grounded facts and unfounded hyperbole," Mr. Finneran said. "We have full confidence in the Federal Reserve's ability to reach the appropriate conclusion."

HEADLINE: United in Disdain for Dodd-Frank, Wall Street Is Split on the Details

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: Wall Street institutions are of one mind in disliking limitations on their operations, but there is much less unanimity when it comes to the specific rules stemming from Dodd-Frank. 

 BODY:
While the biggest rivals on Wall Street share a common disdain for new constraints on financial risk-taking, they're fighting over exactly how to tame the sprawling regulatory overhaul.
Major industry lobbyists like the Chamber of Commerce and the American Bankers Association are split on crucial rules stemming from the Dodd-Frank Act, including restrictions on lending and the $600 trillion derivatives market, two areas at the center of the financial crisis. As federal officials flesh out some 300 new regulations, top companies and trade groups are squabbling over the fine print, each cheerleading for policies that suit their own businesses.
 "On almost every issue, competitors are fighting over the outcome of regulations," said Mark D. Young, a former regulator who is now a lawyer at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom.
Some level of discord is expected. The Dodd-Frank law, which spans some 2,300 pages, is as huge and disparate as the industry it polices.
But a few industry debates have grown hostile. Firms are taking aim at competitors, and regulators are stuck in the awkward position of picking winners and losers - all of which has delayed new rules.
"Our charge as regulators is to ensure market integrity and an open and competitive marketplace for all market participants," said Gary Gensler, chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
The nation's biggest banks, at odds with their smaller brethren, are pushing Mr. Gensler to soften proposed rules that would create broader competition in the derivatives industry, according to several people close to the agency who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the rules are not yet finished. The banks, including Morgan Stanley, worry that smaller players may not have the financial fortitude to take on potential risks, concerns echoed earlier this year by a European regulator.
But some peripheral firms want to break the stranglehold. A new Dodd-Frank rule unveiled earlier this year to "permit fair and open access" to the business drew rare compliments from State Street, a financial firm that is looking to grab a share of Wall Street's profits.
State Street dashed off a glowing letter in March, saying it "strongly supports" the proposal and proclaiming that the rules "would effectively implement Congress's intent." At the same time, it warned against offering "unfair advantages to established" banks in the derivatives world.
The Dodd-Frank rule-making has also pitted two stalwarts in derivatives trading - the CME Group and the IntercontinentalExchange - against each other. While the two companies, which offer clearinghouses and trading platforms, agree on many new rules, they are fighting over one of the law's most contentious issues, the so-called position limits plan. The rule would place hard caps on speculative trading in commodities like oil, wheat and gold.
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission has proposed relaxing position limits for certain trades, those settled with cash payments rather than by exchanging the actual commodity. ICE specializes in cash settlements.
Now CME is crying foul, accusing regulators of encouraging customers to flock to its competitor. The plan, CME said in an August letter to the agency, "defies sound regulatory policy."
"We do not believe the commission intends to increase the threat of commodity price manipulation, yet its proposal would do so."
ICE hit back with its own hostile missive that portrayed CME, in essence, as a sore loser. "The only party advocating for a change in the well-functioning status quo is CME, who is clearly biased regarding the issue," ICE said in letter to the commodity commission.
Scott O'Malia, a Republican commissioner at the agency, recently returned from a family vacation and remarked to colleagues that his school-age children were better behaved, or at least more civil, than ICE and CME. This summer, another high-ranking regulator encouraged the companies' executives to call off the public feud, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.
Later, Mr. Gensler met separately on the same day in August with Craig S. Donohue, CME's chief executive, and Jeffrey Sprecher, the head of ICE. No compromise was reached.
Regulators are also looking to find common ground at the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, another creation of Dodd-Frank.
As it prepared to open its doors in July, the bureau summoned consumer advocates and financial industry lobbyists to its Washington headquarters, soliciting their feedback on plans to regulate shadowy corners of the lending industry. At one afternoon meeting, nearly 20 officials from such varied groups as the NAACP and the Financial Services Roundtable gathered in a conference room to discuss the limits of the bureau's power.
While the American Bankers Association and other industry groups advocated broad authority over large debt collectors and the like, the Chamber of Commerce was notably silent at the meeting. Jess Sharp, an executive from the chamber, which represents both the banking industry and a wide cross section of nonbank financial firms, declined to share his opinion or drop hints about the group's position.
"My sense was that it was a tactical silence," said Travis Plunkett, legislative director for the Consumer Federation of America, who attended the meeting.
A month later, the chamber split with its friends in the financial world. In a letter to regulators, two top chamber executives suggested the consumer bureau "cease all development" of the rule until Congress approved a director to lead the agency. The letter also urged the bureau to "tread carefully" when spelling out which financial markets it would supervise. Officials at the consumer bureau have since met privately with the chamber, which has not retreated from its position, a person with knowledge of the matter said.
Despite the split, Mr. Sharp of the chamber says the financial industry largely speaks with one voice on Dodd-Frank.
"I have not seen serious substantive disagreements," he said in an interview. "If anything, there is strong unity on the legislative reforms to Dodd-Frank."
While they may agree on the broad strokes, the disagreements can be in the details. And with Dodd-Frank, the details are plenty.
"These types of differences happen all the time," said Scott Talbott, a top lobbyist for the Financial Services Roundtable. "The financial services industry is broad and diverse and segments are often in competition with each other."

HEADLINE: Details Emerge on Draft of Volcker Rule

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: The draft document from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation expands the ban on proprietary trading by banks, but it leaves many details to be determined. 

 BODY:
Federal regulators are planning to vote next week on plans to prohibit banks from making certain lucrative, yet risky trades, the latest step toward reining in risk-taking on Wall Street in the aftermath of the financial crisis.
As the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation prepares on Tuesday to vote on the so-called Volcker Rule, some clues have emerged on the details of the proposal. 
The American Banker on Wednesday published a document on its Web site that appeared to be the latest version of the proposal. The document spelled out the scope of the rule's ban on proprietary trading and its broad exemptions for more routine business practices that can be mistaken for riskier trades.
But the 205-page draft, dated Sept. 30 and labeled confidential, left many details to be developed in coming months. Indeed, the draft posed dozens of questions for the public and the financial industry to address, leaving the window open for significant changes.
People close to the rule-making cautioned late on Wednesday that regulators could even make adjustments to the rule over the next week, before the F.D.I.C.'s scheduled vote on Tuesday. And three other federal agencies must also vote on the proposal for it to advance into a public comment period that would end in December.
Still, the F.D.I.C.'s vote will start what is sure to be a long fight over the minutiae of the Volcker Rule, a centerpiece of the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory overhaul and one of the law's most contentious provisions. Major banks have railed against it, saying it will eat into profits without making the financial system much safer. Many lawmakers, however, see the rule as a way to prevent future bailouts of Wall Street, which nearly collapsed during the financial crisis.
Named after Paul A. Volcker, a former Federal Reserve chairman who championed the rule as part of Dodd-Frank, it would order banks to limit their investments in hedge funds and private equity shops. 
More significant, the Volcker Rule would prohibit federally insured banks from trading for their own benefit rather than for clients, a strategy known as proprietary trading. The rule, Mr. Volcker and Democratic lawmakers say, will prevent banks from using their own capital to place bets while the government guarantees their deposits.
"Financial firms have been engaged in high-risk high-jinks that have threatened the U.S. and worldwide economy and economic recovery," Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, who co-sponsored the Volcker Rule in Congress, said on Wednesday. "The Volcker Rule is essential to protect taxpayers from banks' excessive financial risk-taking, conflicts of interest, and from the resulting billion-dollar bailouts. I look forward to reviewing the proposed rule and hope the regulators reject efforts to weaken the law."
Banks have spent more than a year preparing for life under the Volcker Rule. Goldman Sachs was among the first major Wall Street firm to close its proprietary trading desk. JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup announced similar plans to spin off their desks, and Bank of America declared over the summer that its proprietary trading operation had closed.
But truly banning proprietary trading will take more than closing a few trading desks. The Volcker Rule exists in a gray area, where the line is often blurred between when a trade is proprietary or part of a bank's routine market-making activity, which can include buying securities with an eye toward later selling them to clients.
Dodd-Frank provides several exemptions from the ban, including underwriting, hedging and market making. The draft proposal that emerged on Wednesday would exempt even more varieties of hedging than originally expected. This summer, noting the difficulty in detecting proprietary trading, a Government Accountability Office report painted the Volcker Rule as cumbersome and tough to enforce. At the time, Mr. Levin called the G.A.O. report "woefully incomplete."

HEADLINE: Land Deal Is Announced to Allow New U.N. Tower and Esplanade

BYLINE: DAVID W. CHEN


HIGHLIGHT: The agreement, involving a $73 million payment to the city for a playground, paves the way for waterfront access along the East River. It needs the approval of the U.N., but that is expected. 

 BODY:
City and state officials on Wednesday agreed to a $73 million plan that would unlock an underutilized chunk of the Manhattan waterfront between East 38th and East 60th Streets, paving the way for a new United Nations office tower and esplanade along the East River.
The deal would enable the city to plug in the largest remaining gap in the 32-mile Greenway around Manhattanas part of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's effort to revitalize the city's waterfront for commercial, recreation and transportation purposes.
It would also enable the United Nations to begin a land-use review for a long-planned tower that could be no taller than the 505-foot tall Secretariat Building.
There is no guarantee that the United Nations will commit to the deal, since it was not a party to the agreement. But there is every expectation that the United Nations will be supportive, since it has long sought the land just south of its landmark tower -- currently a playground -- where it could build a new tower. Moreover, the United Nations Development Corporation, a city-state public-benefit corporation that handles the United Nations' real estate needs, was deeply involved in the negotiations.
In a news conference at City Hall, Mr. Bloomberg said that the project could allow the United Nations to create jobs. He also said that it was a "once-in-a-generation opportunity to open a major section of the waterfront, and that's great news for all New Yorkers, but especially those who live on the East Side."
According to the deal, the development corporation would pay the city $73 million for the parkland. Once a new tower is erected, the United Nations, which has been renting 1 and 2 United Nations Plaza from the city at below-market rates, would move its offices out of those buildings or begin paying market rents. Selling those buildings would provide the balance of the money to finance the esplanade.
Some residents of the area, especially those in Tudor City, have criticized the plan, saying that a new skyscraper, at First Avenue and 41st Street, would wall them off from the East River. But many local officials have argued that the deal could help residents realize their long-held dream of waterfront access.
At the news conference, Assemblyman Brian Kavanaugh, who represents the area, said he anticipated that construction could begin in a few years.
"We're not talking about a two-decade time frame here," he said.

HEADLINE: Christie's Decision Leaves Republicans With Stark Choice

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: Republican voters will now have to support Mitt Romney or coalesce behind an alternative who can appeal to the Tea Party movement. 

 BODY:
The choice is now clear.
Republican voters are going to pick a challenger for President Obama who is a pragmatic member of the party's establishment - or they will coalesce behind a firebrand whose primary appeal is to the Tea Party movement.
Chris Christie's decision on Tuesday to pass up a White House bid means that only one establishment candidate remains: Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, who offers brainy competence and private-sector experience as the answer to four years of Mr. Obama.
And Sarah Palin's apparent decision not to run - she has been largely silent as the filing deadlines approach - probably means that the former Alaska governor will not become the outsize candidate who seizes the the Tea Party mantle during the fall.
That leaves a much more complicated battle to be the conservative alternative to Mr. Romney.
Rick Perry, the governor of Texas, remains the most likely Republican candidate to carry the message of the angry, fired-up conservative base of the party, in spite of his stumbles and the recent gains of candidates like Herman Cain.
But Mr. Perry is an imperfect messenger whose positions on immigration and the HPV vaccine make the true believers suspicious. And his shaky debate performances, statements on Social Security and the recent controversy over a racial epithet painted on a rock in his hometown have created concern among members of the Tea Party that he might not be able to win next year.
In recent days, Mr. Cain, the former chief executive of Godfather Pizza, has surged in national polls. Representative Ron Paul of Texas remains a popular alternative, particularly among young libertarians. And Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota has faded recently but continues to campaign vigorously in Iowa.
Still, Mr. Perry is expected to report far more money in the bank later this month. If he can regain his political composure, it may be tough for the other conservatives to beat him, especially in places like South Carolina and Iowa, where Christian conservatives tend to dominate the voting.
If he succeeds, the long-term political battle to emerge next year will be a fight between Mr. Romney and Mr. Perry, each proxies for the two dominant forces in the modern Republican party.
Aides to Mr. Romney have long predicted that the nomination fight would produce that kind of philosophical contest. His top strategists often compare the Republican primary to a college basketball championship, with two separate brackets.
In the establishment bracket, they predicted that Mr. Romney would have faced other candidates. Early this year, that was Tim Pawlenty, the former governor of Minnesota, who dropped out after a disappointing showing in the straw poll in Ames, Iowa.
Mitch Daniels, the governor of Indiana, would have been in that bracket if he had decided to run. So would Mr. Christie, who would have made the case for pragmatic but bold leadership that could break through the deadlock in Washington.
All of those candidates would have fought for the same establishment donors - the wealthy industrialists who want the certainty of someone in the Oval Office who will follow the established rules and will not rock the economic boat. 
Mr. Romney has emerged as the only remaining candidate in that bracket. But as his advisers have always recognized, he will have to face someone from the other bracket - the Tea Party bracket - before he can claim the nomination next summer.
Mrs. Bachmann was the first leader of the Tea Party bracket, emerging as a force in Iowa in the summer. Mr. Perry's entrance into the race on the day Mrs. Bachmann won the straw poll helped slam the brakes on her campaign. But Mr. Perry's own problems in the last month have provided an opening for others in the race - as well as raising the question again about Ms. Palin's intentions.
Ms. Palin had said publicly she would decide on a presidential run by the end of September, and people close to her suggested that she would make that decision known soon after. If they are right, an announcement that she will not run could come within days.
Now, as the remaining candidates in the Tea Party bracket prepare to fight each other in Iowa, Mr. Romney and his advisers have to decide what to do next.
Do they stick to their plan of largely avoiding a drawn-out, costly battle in Iowa and wait for the winner of the Tea Party bracket to arrive in New Hampshire - home turf for Mr. Romney?
Or does the contest among the Tea Party candidates provide an opening for Mr. Romney in Iowa? If Mr. Perry, Mrs. Bachmann, Mr. Cain and the others split the conservative Iowa vote, perhaps Mr. Romney could campaign there and win a victory with a plurality of the votes.
A victory by Mr. Romney in Iowa, followed by another in New Hampshire, could end the campaign quickly. But it's also a risky proposition. If Mr. Romney campaigns vigorously in Iowa again - he spent $20 million in the state in 2007 - and loses, he could damage his prospects.
What will he decide? With Mr. Christie out of the picture, and Ms. Palin making a decision soon, we may know soon enough.

HEADLINE: Perry Campaign Reports $17 Million Haul

BYLINE: NICHOLAS CONFESSORE


HIGHLIGHT: The Perry campaign shows its fund-raising strength in its first quarterly report. 

 BODY:
UPDATE, 7:50 p.m.: A fuller version of this blog post can be found here.
Gov. Rick Perry of Texas raised more than $17 million through the end of September, his presidential campaign announced on Wednesday, a strong showing that confirms his reputation as a capable fund-raiser and is likely to outstrip all of the Republican field save for Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor.
Mr. Perry, who entered race on Aug. 13 -- midway through the third fund-raising quarter -- ended the quarter with $15 million in cash on hand, his campaign said, with half of his donations from outside donor-rich Texas.
Those numbers suggest Mr. Perry's early fund-raising blitz succeeded in spite of the traditionally slow summer fund-raising season and despite efforts by his campaign to lower expectations in recent weeks. His campaign had suggested last week that Mr. Perry was more likely to bring in somewhere around $10 million.
Mr. Romney's campaign has suggested that it would have raised between $10 and $13 million during the entire third quarter. Mr. Romney raised about $18 million last quarter.
Mr. Perry's announcement followed several difficult weeks for his campaign, with debate stumbles and other controversies - including whether he had taken guests hunting at a West Texas camp with a racially charged name - that had sapped some of the early enthusiasm many Republican officials and voters seemed to show for his bid.
It also comes a day after Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey opted out of a White House run, news that bolstered Mr. Romney's prospects and was likely to help him solidify his backing among wealthy Wall Street donors and other high-dollar Republican contributors in the Northeast.
"The generous contributions from Americans across the nation prove the overwhelming support for Governor Perry's principled, conservative leadership and vision to get America working again," Mr. Perry's campaign manager, Rob Johnson, said. "The governor will continue traveling the country, talking directly to Americans about restoring our economic strength, job creation and putting our country on a path to prosperity and opportunity for future generations."
President Obama's own fund-raising is likely to exceed any of the Republicans', with his campaign setting a goal last month of $55 million - a figure he will almost surely exceed - for the joint fund-raising committee that he shares with the Democratic National Committee.
While Mr. Perry's campaign boasted that half of his checks came from outside Texas, they did not offer any insight into what proportion of his total money came from well-established networks inside the state, leaving unclear the extent to which the Texas governor may have tapped out his most loyal home-state donors early on in order to show strong numbers.
But the strong third-quarter showing for Mr. Perry is likely to help re-establish him as the race's chief alternative to Mr. Romney, who lapped the other Republican candidates during the last fund-raising period.

HEADLINE: Palin Says She's Not Running

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: Sarah Palin tells a radio host that she can be more active in trying to oust President Obama if she is not a candidate. 

 BODY:
UPDATE, 6:35 p.m.: Sarah Palin is not running for president.
Ms. Palin, the former governor of Alaska, ended her inscrutable cat-and-mouse game with the political establishment on Wednesday afternoon by saying that she would not join the field of Republican candidates seeking her party's nomination, but would still work to oust President Obama.
"Not being a candidate, you are unshackled and able to be even more active," she said during a "Mark Levin Show" appearance. "I look forward to using all the tools at my disposal to get the right people in there who have a servant's heart."
 The decision from Ms. Palin on Wednesday placed a punctuation mark on the Republican presidential field. Her intentions were the biggest remaining question in the race. While there was not a groundswell of support among Republican leaders for a Palin candidacy, she has a deeply loyal following.
 Her announcement, which took the Republican world by surprise, was vintage Palin. It also raised the question of how intensely she plans to be involved in the race and whether she intends to endorse a candidate or simply be a commentator, cheerleader or critic.
 For a year, Ms. Palin had given many signals that she would not run. She has repeatedly suggested that she could have a bigger influence if she was not a candidate. But her supporters were convinced that she was running. A Labor Day weekend appearance in Iowa drew boosters from across the country, most of whom said they were certain she would run.
The immediate effect of her decision to stay on the sidelines was minimal. Yet the long-term impact is less certain. As she demonstrated in the successful Republican midterm elections last year, her endorsement was a hot ticket.
Her late decision comes a day after Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey announced that he, too, would take a pass on a presidential bid.
Ms. Palin, who rocketed to fame as the Republican vice-presidential nominee in 2008, said she still intended to use her celebrity status to wield political influence without the support of a Republican infrastructure that is wary of her powerful but unorthodox appeal.
Speaking on the radio show, Ms. Palin said that she intended to continue waging a "mission to help wake up America to what's going on in this country."
"I can be more effective and more aggressive in this mission" without being a candidate, she said.
"I need to be able to say what I want to say," she added, and to "call out the wrongheadedness of our leaders who are leading us down this path. Let us unite to restore this country."
In an e-mail sent to her supporters, Ms. Palin said she had decided not to run out of respect for her family and the impact that a campaign would have on them.
"As always, my family comes first and obviously Todd and I put great consideration into family life before making this decision," she wrote, referring to her husband. "When we serve, we devote ourselves to God, family and country. My decision maintains this order."
She said in the e-mail that she would remain politically active.
"I will continue driving the discussion for freedom and free markets, including in the race for president where our candidates must embrace immediate action toward energy independence through domestic resource developments of conventional energy sources, along with renewables," she wrote. "We must reduce tax burdens and onerous regulations that kill American industry, and our candidates must always push to minimize government to strengthen the economy and allow the private sector to create jobs."
Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, whose candidacy could benefit the most from her decision, called Ms. Palin "a good friend, a great American and a true patriot."
"I respect her decision and know she will continue to be a strong voice for conservative values and needed change in Washington," he said in a statement.
Aides to Ms. Palin have said for months that a Palin campaign would have largely ignored the usual political traditions in favor of an effort designed to communicate directly with the public through Ms. Palin's Facebook page and Twitter feed, which combine to reach millions of followers.
Ms. Palin has used those forums, as well as her contract as a prominent Fox News analyst, to maintain her position as one of the leading conservative voices in the Republican Party during the last several years. In the 2010 midterm elections, her endorsement served as a powerful indication of support from the Tea Party movement, which Ms. Palin has adopted has her own.
She has also become one of the fiercest critics of Mr. Obama's policies at a time that Republican voters are longing for someone who can reclaim the White House from the Democratic Party. 
"Barack Obama has shown us cronyism on steroids," she said in and Iowa speech on Labor Day. "It will lead to our downfall if we don't stop it now. The challenge is not simply to replace Obama in 2012. The real challenge is who and what we will replace him with. It's not enough to just change up the uniform. If we don't change the team and the game plan, we won't save our country."
The question of whether Ms. Palin would join the 2012 presidential race had been one of the most intriguing - and hotly debated - among veteran political observers in Washington. Many assumed that she would decide against a bid because of her financial success as a best-selling author, political commentator and reality TV star.
There was also the experience of the 2008 campaign, which served as a brutal entry onto the national political stage for Ms. Palin and her family. In three intense months, her intelligence was mocked, her family was scrutinized and she developed a searing distrust of political consultants and the national press corps. 
Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who picked Ms. Palin to be his vice-presidential nominee in 2008, went to Twitter Wednesday evening to comment: "I am confident she'll continue to play an important role in our Party and for our nation."
Until her announcement, there have been plenty of clues that Ms. Palin was intent on keeping alive the possibility of a presidential campaign.
Her two best-selling books served as responses to the mockery she received as a candidate for vice president and as the beginnings of a platform from which she could build a political identity separate from Senator McCain.
She continued both efforts as a highly-paid public speaker -- reportedly earning as much as $100,000 a speech -- and as a highly paid analyst for Fox News. She also built an online presence that rivals almost every other national politician. Her commentary on Twitter and Facebook regularly get more attention than most officeholders.
And earlier this year, Ms. Palin began a thinly veiled test of what it might be like to campaign for president by taking her family on visits to historic American landmarks in her "One Nation" bus tour.
Ms. Palin insisted that the bus tour was more family vacation than political exercise. But her small circle of aides made little effort to disabuse journalists of the idea that the bus tour was designed to lay the groundwork for a possible campaign.
The tour also proved Ms. Palin's devilish side. She took the bus into New Hampshire just as Mitt Romney formally announced his campaign in the state. And she suddenly arrived at the Iowa State Fair on the day before the Republican straw poll in Ames. 
A campaign would have tested her political appeal as she began campaigning alongside her rivals for the nomination, Michele Bachmann, Mr. Romney and Mr. Perry. There are barely three months until the voting begins in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina early next year, and Ms. Palin would have started with almost no formal campaign infrastructure in any of those states.
A campaign would have tested Ms. Palin's ability to quickly raise millions of dollars necessary to finance a modern presidential campaign. Those closest to her have said they believed donations from her many admirers around the country would have rapidly poured in over the Internet.

HEADLINE: In Los Angeles, Scaled-Back Plan for Film Museum

BYLINE: By MICHAEL CIEPLY

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- The movies may finally get their museum, but it won't be as flashy as originally planned.
Scaling back a proposal to build a landmark building in this city's Hollywood district, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences said on Tuesday night that it would join with the Los Angeles County Museum of Art to develop a museum of the movies that may inhabit part of that art museum's existing complex in the mid-Wilshire area.
In a joint statement the Academy and the county museum described a plan to negotiate contracts and begin fund-raising to open the museum in Lacma West, a former department store that currently houses office space and occasional exhibitions. 
They did not disclose the expected cost of the new museum, or the amount of the Academy's expected contribution. But on Wednesday, Tom Sherak, the Academy's president; Dawn Hudson, its chief executive; and Michael Govan, the art museum's chief executive, described a site that would require much less than the anticipated $400 million cost of the Hollywood project, though it would have more exhibition space.
''It's actually bigger,'' Mr. Sherak said of a museum that will be housed in a 300,000-square-foot space that a May Company department store once occupied.
The new museum could be open in three to five years, if negotiations and fund-raising remain on track, he said.
The new plan follows the collapse of an ambitious effort by the Academy, which has about 6,000 members drawn from Hollywood's professional ranks, to build a huge, free-standing museum as a showcase for the history and craftsmanship of film. That structure was to have been adjoined to its existing Mary Pickford Center for Motion Picture Study, where the Academy preserves and stores film prints, on Vine Street, near Sunset Boulevard.
In 2007 the Academy hired the French architect Christian de Portzamparc, a winner of the Pritzker Architecture Prize, to design a grandiose center that was described by some Academy officials as being comparable in scope to the Walt Disney Concert Hall in downtown Los Angeles, designed by Frank Gehry. Like the Disney Hall, the museum was intended to help revive the neighborhood in which it would have been nested.
But that plan fell apart, as a long writers strike in 2007 and then the 2008 financial crisis diminished fund-raising prospects. And the pullback left the Academy holding several blocks of land that have been estimated to cost $45 million, though much of that value was almost immediately lost in the real estate downturn.
Under the arrangement agreed to on Tuesday, the county museum will lease space and provide guidance for the movie museum, but the Academy will own and control the project and will establish an endowment for its support.
''I think everybody realizes that the great art of the 20th century is film,'' Mr. Govan said of his institution's interest in becoming associated with a museum that reaches beyond the fine arts into popular culture. Recently the Los Angeles County Museum of Art has hosted an exhibition of artwork by the film director Tim Burton, and, he said, will build an exhibition around the work of another director, Stanley Kubrick, next year.
Ms. Hudson said the proposed museum would include newly gathered collections and material drawn from 42,000 movie posters and 10 million movie photographs that are mostly locked away in the Academy's archives.
As of June 30, 2010, the Academy's last published annual report showed that it had about $258.6 million in net assets and investments of about $187 million.
Almost all of the group's income comes from its Oscar show that takes in about $80 million annually and in recent years has cost about $33 million to produce. Structured as a nonprofit, the Academy finances various archives and a library devoted to the movie world, and it has scattered grants among film festivals and education programs.
But it has long been building a nest egg, much of which was earmarked years ago for the development of a museum that has been intended as a focal point of not just Hollywood culture but also world film.

HEADLINE: Services Sector Inches Ahead, Report Says

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Growth in the vast services sector of the United States slowed modestly in September as a contraction in employment eclipsed a jump in new orders, data showed on Wednesday. 
The Institute for Supply Management said its services index dipped to 53.0 points last month from 53.3 in August. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected a reading of 52.9 in September.
Employment in services, which accounts for about 80 percent of the nation's economic activity and nonfarm payrolls, fell last month to its lowest level since April 2010.
Meanwhile, a separate company report said private-sector employers added 91,000 jobs in the United States in September, above economists' expectations.
Economists surveyed by Reuters had predicted that the data, from the A.D.P. National Employment Report, would show a gain of 75,000 jobs.
August private payrolls were revised down to an increase of 89,000 from the previously reported 91,000.

HEADLINE: The Off Switch Always in Reach

BYLINE: By FARHAD MANJOO

 BODY:
I SUSPECT that our species has been longing for ''smart homes'' since prehistoric times. John Q. Caveman is in one corner of his cave, about to retire after a long day of gathering (he's never been the hunting type), and suddenly, a needling worry becomes lodged in his mind: Did he put out the fire in front of the cave? He vaguely remembers doing so, but what if he's thinking of last night, not tonight?
Millennia later, we are caught in the same fix. Do you drag yourself out of bed and down two flights of stairs to check if you turned off the space heater in the basement?
Home automation was supposed to have solved this. For decades, technology companies and futurist magazines have teased us with visions of houses in which the lighting, temperature, TV and audio system could be controlled from a central unit. You are supposed to be able to check on that basement heater while staying snug under the blanket. 
But while much of the necessary technology exists, easy-to-use smart-home systems have always been the province of the ultra-wealthy. Economical D.I.Y. alternatives for the rest of us, including partial home-automation devices like universal remotes for entertainment systems and devices that control appliances remotely, have largely fallen short of the home-automation dream.
The good news is that the prices on that other route to a smart home, customized systems installed by professionals, are slowly starting to fall. Some upper-middle-class people may already be able to afford a professionally designed setup that controls at least a complete entertainment system, or maybe one that controls a few items, like the TV, the lights, the thermostat, the door locks and, say, the coffee maker, while others may be able to afford them soon.
Randy Stearns, the president of Engineered Environments, a Bay Area company that sells professionally designed automation systems, showed me one of his smaller projects, the automation of an entertainment system for Bill Weeks, a retired real estate executive who lives near San Francisco.
Mr. Weeks's wall-mounted TV was connected to a rack of other audiovisual equipment in a nook carved out of a nearby stairwell. There were no visible wires; all the connections were hidden behind a wall panel. Mr. Weeks could control his entire system with a single remote that had been configured to his specifications by one of Mr. Stearns's technicians.
When I have tested store-bought universal remote controls, they typically get out of sync with the equipment, or lack certain crucial buttons, and inevitably I needed to reach for the original remotes to get everything under control.
But the remote that Mr. Stearns's firm provided as part of Mr. Weeks's system (URC's MX-980, a complex device usually sold to and configured by professional installers) did not suffer from those flaws. Its buttons and on-screen panel could be endlessly programmed to do exactly what a user wanted. When Mr. Weeks pressed ''Watch DVD,'' for instance, his TV and his DVD player sprang into action. It was easy to use, too. Mr. Weeks said he had never had to explain how to use the TV, not even to baby sitters or grandparents.
''We wanted to make it obvious for everyone who came by,'' he said.
He had to pay for that simplicity, though. The total cost of Mr. Weeks's configuration, including equipment and installation, was $4,600, in addition to the television, which he bought separately.
Mr. Weeks's bill is representative of current prices; professionally installed smart-home systems run from a few thousand to tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars, depending on the scope of the job. But Dave Pedigo, senior director of technology for the Custom Electronic Design and Installation Association, a trade group of home theater and home automation installers, said prices for custom automation kept falling, and that one major reason was the advent of touch-screen devices like the iPhone and iPad.
''The onslaught of Apple and Google devices has really been changing this market,'' Mr. Pedigo said.
To illustrate Mr. Pedigo's point, and to give me a taste of what less-affluent homeowners might be able to enjoy in coming years, Mr. Stearns took me to a sprawling house in the Bay Area suburb of Atherton, where his firm had installed an extensive home-automation system.
It included more than a dozen televisions, among them a 103-inch screen in a dedicated home cinema, as well as a whole-home audio system, with speakers mounted invisibly in the ceiling. There was also an integrated lighting and climate-control system, so that the family could, say, keep tabs on the temperature in the wine cellar while working out in the home gym, on the other side of the property.
Here is where the story gets back to the rest of us: This family commands its princely system, which cost $400,000 to design and install, from something as simple as an iPad (or, in this case, any of the seven iPads conveniently located in various parts of the house). Before the advent of touch-screen phones and tablets, Mr. Stearns said, he would have used custom-made controllers for this automated system -- and those devices cost several thousand dollars each. But the iPad controller costs $499, a big savings. And because the iPad can be customized with different apps, it can be made to control lots of companies' systems.
In this way, as prices fall at the high end, they become more approachable for the rest of us. Consider a very basic security and home-automation service offered by a company called Vivint. The professionally installed package carries a base price of $200, and a monthly service fee of about $70, including security monitoring.
To be sure, Vivint's system lacks the refinements of a higher-priced custom system installed by a dealer affiliated with Mr. Pedigo's association; Vivint's system does not plug into a home-entertainment center, for example. But for many people a simple system can be very helpful. Vivint's includes a video surveillance camera, an automatic door lock, a remote-controlled smart thermostat and a module to control one appliance. (Extra modules cost a one-time fee of $39 each.)
''We think that the reason these technologies haven't been adopted is because it's been very complicated and expensive to have them,'' said Alex Dunn, the company's chief operating officer, ''and we felt we could change that by changing the business model.''
Jake Zalewski, a San Franciscan who manages a network of college bookstores and travels frequently on business, said his Vivint system has freed him from worrying about all the little things everyone thinks about after leaving the house. Did he remember to lock the door, turn off the lights, set the air-conditioner, turn on the alarm? He can quell all those concerns with Vivint's app on his iPhone, from anywhere he has an Internet connection.
''It just makes it so convenient,'' Mr. Zalewski said. He is planning to install a second system at his house in Lake Tahoe, and is looking forward to one feature in particular: turning on his hot tub when he leaves San Francisco, so it's ready to be jumped into when he arrives a few hours later.
As technology prices fall, low-cost systems like Vivint's could gain many capabilities while keeping prices level. In addition to controlling your lighting, appliances and thermostat, for example, you might also be able to adjust your sprinklers and be alerted when there are water leaks.
Recently, Sigma Designs, a company that makes a home-automation technology linking many gadgets, announced that it had made its systems compatible with ''smart meters'' that utilities countrywide are rolling out to customers. This development may enable you to program your appliances to turn on and off according to the price of electricity. Your dishwasher, for instance, could turn on when it notices electrical rates have dropped.
Such advances are likely to be installed in the fanciest homes first. But as prices fall, it might not be too long before, finally, we are all in control of every corner of our caves.

HEADLINE: Surgery Rate Late in Life Surprises Researchers

BYLINE: By GINA KOLATA

 BODY:
Surgery is surprisingly common in older people during the last year, month and even week of life, researchers reported Wednesday, a finding that is likely to stoke, but not resolve, the debate over whether medical care is overused and needlessly driving up medical costs.
The most comprehensive examination of operations performed on Medicare recipients in the final year of life found that nationally in 2008, nearly one recipient in three had surgery in the last year of life. Nearly one in five had surgery in the last month of life. Nearly one in 10 had surgery in the last week of life. 
The very oldest patients were less likely to have surgery. Those who were 65 had a 38.4 percent chance of having surgery in the last year of life. For 80-year-olds, the chance was 35.3 percent, but the rates fell off more sharply from there, declining by a third by age 90.
But such analyses are controversial. By looking only at people who died, researchers can get a skewed picture of what is taking place, critics say.
''Because the patient died, you can't assume that the treatment and therapies were not of value,'' said Dr. Peter B. Bach of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. ''Although in that individual, things may not have worked out, you have no insight into whether the decision to operate was appropriate.'' Nor is it known how many similar patients who had that same surgery did not die.
But the sheer number of operations at the end of life was unexpected, said the researchers, at Harvard School of Public Health. They added that they did not know why the operations had been done. Some undoubtedly were necessary to relieve pain and suffering or to prolong life. But, they said, they know from experience that doctors often operate to repair something that can be fixed but that will not save a dying patient, avoiding the difficult discussions with patients about their prognosis and whether the surgery will improve or compromise their quality of life.
In their study, published Wednesday in The Lancet, the investigators analyzed data for all the 1,802,029 Medicare recipients 65 and older who died in 2008. In addition to the number of operations nationally, they reported marked regional variations in the use of surgery at the end of life. For example, the rate of surgery in Honolulu was a third of that in Gary, Ind.
''Honolulu and Gary, Ind., can't both be doing it right,'' said Dr. Ashish Jha, an associate professor of health policy at Harvard and the lead author of the study.
But regional variations in health care have been controversial because it is not clear whether they reflect true differences in patient needs or in health care practices or regional differences in health care payment rules, Dr. Bach said.
Dr. Scott Ramsey, an economist and a physician who is director of cancer outcomes research at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, faulted the researchers for citing regional differences but then suggesting a long list of factors that might be causing them, including the health of the population, the patterns of medical practice, and the availability of hospice care and other end-of-life services.
Their list of potential explanations ''covers about everything and says absolutely nothing,'' Dr. Ramsey said.
But the researchers said their study -- done from public records and with no financing -- probably pointed to a real problem in American medicine: surgery, which can be painful, expensive and debilitating, is tempting for doctors and patients alike.
''I will admit to being guilty of this,'' Dr. Jha said. ''Often we say, 'If you have this intervention, we will be able to fix that problem. You have an intestinal blockage. Surgery will fix it.' But will it let you walk out of the hospital alive? Will it let you return to your old life?''
Dr. Mark McClellan, a former commissioner of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, who directs the Engelberg Center for Health Care Reform at the Brookings Institution, said, ''Evidence like this -- and a lot of previous evidence, directly from patients and their families -- shows that we need much better support for patients and their families when they have serious illnesses and may need intensive treatments.''
Dr. Jha said he and his colleagues were continuing to study the causes and consequences of surgery at the end of life, adding, ''It is hard to take these data and make clear policy recommendations about what is appropriate and what is not.''
But he said he had no doubt that the difficult conversations that should precede a decision to operate all too often never occurred.
''As clinicians, we often end up focusing on something narrow and small that we think we can fix,'' Dr. Jha said. ''That leads us down the path of surgical intervention. But what the patient cares about is not going to get fixed.''
Dr. Jha provided a recent example from his hospital. A man had metastatic pancreatic cancer and was dying. A month earlier, he had been working and looked fine.
''No one had talked to him about how close he was to death,'' Dr. Jha said. ''It's the worst kind of conversation to have.''
Instead, doctors did an endoscopy and a colonoscopy because the man had internal bleeding. Then they did abdominal surgery. ''We did all of this because we were trying desperately to find something we could fix,'' Dr. Jha said.
The man died of a complication from the surgery.
''The tragedy is what we should have done for him but didn't,'' Dr. Jha said. ''We should have given him time to have the conversation he wanted to have with his family. You can't do that when you are in pain from surgery, groggy from anesthesia. We should have controlled his pain. We should have controlled his nausea.''
Instead, Dr. Jha said, ''we sent him to the O.R.''

HEADLINE: Wall Street Follows European Markets Higher

BYLINE: By JOSHUA BRUSTEIN; Jack Ewing contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Wall Street stocks closed higher on Wednesday, supported by some positive economic data on the American economy and optimism that European policy makers would act to contain the potential damage of its sovereign debt problems.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 20.08 points, or 1.79 percent, to 1,144.03, while the Dow Jones industrial average rose 131.24 points, or 1.21 percent to 10,939.95.
Oil and gas companies registered the largest gains, but all sectors of the Dow rose with the exception of telecommunications companies. 
The Nasdaq composite index rose 55.69 points, or 2.32 percent, to 2,460.51, driven partly by sharp increases in Research in Motion and Yahoo, after both companies were the subject of rumors that they would be bought.
Traders described the day, which was the second consecutive positive session on Wall Street, as a respite of sorts after large fluctuations on Monday and Tuesday. The VIX, a measure of volatility in the markets, fell 16.9 percent in the last two days of trading after reaching its highest level since August.
''Fear just can't stay up that high that long,'' said Randy Warren, an investment manager at Warren Financial Services.
Stocks in Asia continued the trend in early trading Thursday. The benchmark index in Tokyo was up about 2 percent and that in Hong Kong was up about 4 percent.
Still, the S.& P., seen as a broad indicator of the market as a whole, is down more than 9 percent for the year.
The energy sector gained as benchmark crude oil futures for November delivery rose 5.3 percent to $79.68 a barrel. Chevron was up $3.18, more than 3 percent, at $94.66, and ExxonMobil rose more than 1 percent to $73.95. Economic data released Wednesday gave a few hopeful signs for the American economy.
Monsanto rose $3.30, or 5 percent, to $66.25, after reporting that its quarterly results, while a loss for the period, were better than Wall Street expected and that its corn sales rose 58 percent.
Costco also reported results and its stock fell $1.40, to $80.25, after reporting that its profit was hurt by rising costs and fell one cent short of analysts' estimates.
A report by the Institute for Supply Management showed that nonmanufacturing businesses continued to grow in September, but at a lower rate than in August. The index registered 53 percent, in line with analysts' expectations. A figure above 50 percent indicates growth. New orders increased 3.7 percentage points, a possible sign of strengthening performance.
However, the report also registered a contraction in employment after 12 consecutive months of growth. The index's level for employment registered 48.7 percent, down 2.9 percentage points. Prices also increased at a slower rate in September.
Kathy Jones, a fixed-income strategist at Charles Schwab, said the data probably reflected persistent reluctance among businesses to be too aggressive.
''Maybe we got some good orders right now, but we're not confident with that trend continuing,'' she said.
A separate report on employment from ADP Employer Services showed that private employers added 91,000 jobs in September at a seasonally adjusted level, slightly better than analysts' expectations.
Some economists see the report as a hint of what to expect on Friday when the Labor Department publishes its September jobs data. The government's job report is considered one of the most important indicators of the health of the national economy. Analysts expect it to show 65,000 new jobs for the month.
Interest rates were higher. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 22/32, to 102 3/32, and the yield rose to 1.89 percent from 1.82 percent late Tuesday.
Investors latched onto reports that European officials are working on a plan to recapitalize the Continent's banks, and stocks continued to gain in Europe.
The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said she would push for more capital to protect her nation's banks, while European banking regulators said they would conduct new ''stress tests'' to identify the region's most vulnerable financial institutions.
The Euro Stoxx 50 index, a gauge of blue-chip shares in the euro zone, closed up 4.22 percent. In London, the FTSE 100 closed up 3.19 percent.
The dollar was relatively stable, with the euro trading at $1.3344.
Comex gold futures were essentially flat at $1,640.30.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.
Online Correction: October 5, 2011, Wednesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this article had an incorrect surname for Kathy Jones, a fixed-income strategist at Charles Schwab.

HEADLINE: Kenya: Aid Has Blunted Famine In Horn of Africa, Official Says

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The head of the United States Agency for International Development said that famine relief efforts in the Horn of Africa have saved countless lives. Dr. Rajiv Shah, the agency's administrator, said in Nairobi on Wednesday that resources used in interventions to stop the famine spreading across the region have had an effect. The relief efforts, he said, have mitigated the slide from drought to famine -- which has killed about 29,000 children in Somalia -- in pastoral communities in Kenya and Ethiopia. Dr. Shah added that the United States had contributed more than $600 million to the efforts.

HEADLINE: Flying Chariot of the Wealthy, Noisy Bane of the Earthbound

BYLINE: By N. R. KLEINFIELD and PATRICK McGEEHAN; Meredith Hoffman contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Fluttering off their waterfront launching pads, the whirring helicopters dance through the city's skies. They whisk in corporate executives and hurry travelers to the airports (those agreeable to a $1,750 minimum charge). They escort tourists on speedy sightseeing trips, go up to report the news and how traffic isn't moving. They carry time-sensitive documents to Wall Street.
They shuttle people to the Hamptons, the Atlantic City casinos and the Woodbury Common outlet mall in Central Valley, N.Y. They assist in aerial surveys and move the sick. They bring the president to town. For $1,895, you can get married aboard a helicopter. The police have their own fleet, which must sometimes deposit divers in the water to fish out passengers from helicopter crashes.
In a congested city where time is a ticking cash meter, helicopters are the wingless flying cars of the wealthy and important. For a great majority of residents, though, New York's versatile helicopter world is largely unknown and unused, if often heard -- and sometimes unnerving. 
Chilling reminders of their buzzing presence turn up pretty much yearly when one crashes, as happened on Tuesday afternoon, when a private helicopter sank into the East River near the East 34th Street Heliport, killing one woman.
Helicopters have long had a cranky relationship with some of the city's populace and politicians, who deplore their noise, emissions and what seems to be an unsettling tendency to end up in the water. And indeed, a group of politicians on Wednesday called for a ban on the flying of tourist helicopters in Manhattan, even as helicopter operators maintained that it is far more dangerous to drive in New York.
''A small minority in New York City hates a helicopter, until they're deathly sick and need an E.M.S. helicopter,'' said Michael Roth, the owner of New York Helicopter, one of five helicopter tour and charter operators in the city. ''They're just as important as the double-decker bus, just as important as the three-wheeled bicycle. We are part of the fabric of the tourist industry.''
Something like 100 helicopters regularly travel in and out of the city, making roughly 80,000 takeoffs last year, according to the city's Economic Development Corporation. Industry officials said the recession significantly reduced traffic, though it has been rebounding.
The city estimates that helicopter use injects more than $50 million into the economy annually, and provides hundreds of jobs. Not to mention outsize attention when things go wrong. Around 270 people die in traffic accidents per year in the city, usually without much notice. But the city finds itself riveted whenever a copter goes down.
A partial list of helicopter accidents would include the police helicopter forced to ditch in the waters of Jamaica Bay in September 2010. A year earlier, a sightseeing helicopter and a small plane collided, sending both aircraft into the Hudson and killing all nine people aboard.
Another tourist helicopter found the Hudson in July 2007, while in June 2005 two helicopters entered the water in one week, one a sightseeing helicopter and the other ferrying six executives to the city to do a deal. A news helicopter smashed into the roof of a Brooklyn building in 2004. There were no fatalities in those crashes.
In April 1997, a Colgate-Palmolive executive was killed when a company helicopter crashed into the East River after taking off from a heliport on East 60th Street that the city later closed.
A helicopter went into the Hudson River in 1995, and in 1993 one made an emergency landing in the East River and another in a baseball field in Central Park, scattering lunchtime players. Additional wrecks took place near the 34th Street heliport in 1985, 1988 and 1990; a passenger was killed in the 1985 and 1988 crashes.
In May 1977, a landing helicopter toppled on the roof helipad of what was then the Pan Am building in Midtown. A rotor blade broke off and shot into waiting passengers, killing four of them, as well as a pedestrian on the street. The helipad, an oft-photographed symbol of jet-age convenience, was shut down.
Pilots say the city can be challenging but is not dangerous. Jim Miller, a pilot who runs a tour company called New Jersey Chopper, said, ''I feel safer in a helicopter than in a big Escalade.''
The city's helicopter world emanates from three commercial heliports. In 1956, a heliport opened on the west end of 30th Street, followed, in late 1960, by the Downtown Manhattan Heliport in the East River on the edge of the financial district. The East 34th Street Heliport opened in 1972.
The Downtown Heliport is the only one currently allowed to have public sightseeing flights. It is where the president usually lands on visits to the city.
On Wednesday, the usual range of helicopter need was being satisfied. In the V.I.P. lounge at the West 30th Street heliport, April Schramm, 44, waited for her daughter, a helicopter instructor in Glens Falls, N.Y. She was bringing in two friends for lunch before returning upstate.
Up in the air, a production crew was shooting a scene for the TV show ''Delocated.'' It involved the lead actor's sharing a speedboat with a bikini-clad woman.
At the downtown heliport, Natalie and Jean-Paul Hoffman, from France, waited with a crowd of foreign visitors. They had paid a total of $520 for a half-hour ride. ''It's a sensation of freedom, you get to see everything -- it's a different way to see the world,'' said Ms. Hoffman.
Mr. Hoffman, a helicopter pilot himself, was unruffled by the recent crash, though a group of British visitors, taking a flight to mark a friend's 50th birthday, admitted some discomfort.
''I feel nervous,'' said Tina Power, ''but we reckon lightning doesn't strike twice.'' Ms. Power said friends had insisted they see the city from the sky.
Mike and Irene Firnthrat, from Austria, stepped off a 20-minute helicopter ride ($200 each), proclaiming it was a great honeymoon present.
The pleasant demographics of helicopter passengers interest advertisers. People watching videos of Tuesday's rescue effort may have noticed the letters ''AP'' on the heliport's tarmac. They stand for Audemars Piguet, the Swiss watchmaker, which has an exclusive deal to sponsor the heliport.
Yes, companies buy heliport ad space as if it were the right field fence at Yankee Stadium or a Times Square billboard.
The routine whirring of rotors over the city, though, has been a continuing source of friction with residents who would like to eliminate what they consider nonessential helicopter flights.
''I started this about two or three years ago because I just couldn't take any more calls,'' said Gale A. Brewer, a councilwoman from the Upper West Side. Even her husband phones her to complain about the racket from helicopters near their apartment.
But Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, a pilot and helicopter enthusiast, has argued that tourists want an aerial view of the metropolitan area. If the flights cannot originate in the city, they will take off from New Jersey, city officials say, restricting the city's control over the traffic.
After the 2009 collision, new rules governing helicopter and airplane operations above the Hudson River were put in place by the Federal Aviation Administration. And in April 2010, the city banned tourist flights from passing over New York landmarks and anywhere in Brooklyn. Instead, helicopters must fly over water. They remain free to hover over Yankee Stadium, but not during games.

HEADLINE: On Dodd-Frank, United in General but Split on the Details

BYLINE: By BEN PROTESS

 BODY:
While the biggest rivals on Wall Street share a common disdain for new constraints on financial risk-taking, they're fighting over exactly how to tame the sprawling regulatory overhaul.
Major industry lobbyists like the Chamber of Commerce and the American Bankers Association are split on crucial rules stemming from the Dodd-Frank Act, including restrictions on lending and the $600 trillion derivatives market, two areas at the center of the financial crisis. As federal officials flesh out some 300 new regulations, top companies and trade groups are squabbling over the fine print, each cheerleading for policies that suit their own businesses.
''On almost every issue, competitors are fighting over the outcome of regulations,'' said Mark D. Young, a former regulator who is now a lawyer at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. 
Some level of discord is expected. The Dodd-Frank law, which spans some 2,300 pages, is as huge and disparate as the industry it polices.
But a few industry debates have grown hostile. Firms are taking aim at competitors, and regulators are stuck in the awkward position of picking winners and losers - all of which has delayed new rules.
''Our charge as regulators is to ensure market integrity and an open and competitive marketplace for all market participants,'' said Gary Gensler, chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
The nation's biggest banks, at odds with their smaller brethren, are pushing Mr. Gensler to soften proposed rules that would create broader competition in the derivatives industry, according to several people close to the agency who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the rules are not yet finished. The banks, including Morgan Stanley, worry that smaller players may not have the financial fortitude to take on potential risks, concerns echoed earlier this year by a European regulator.
But some peripheral firms want to break the stranglehold. A new Dodd-Frank rule unveiled earlier this year to ''permit fair and open access'' to the business drew rare compliments from State Street, a financial firm that is looking to grab a share of Wall Street's profits.
State Street dashed off a glowing letter in March, saying it ''strongly supports'' the proposal and proclaiming that the rules ''would effectively implement Congress's intent.'' At the same time, it warned against offering ''unfair advantages to established'' banks in the derivatives world.
The Dodd-Frank rule-making has also pitted two stalwarts in derivatives trading - the CME Group and the IntercontinentalExchange - against each other. While the two companies, which offer clearinghouses and trading platforms, agree on many new rules, they are fighting over one of the law's most contentious issues, the so-called position limits plan. The rule would place hard caps on speculative trading in commodities like oil, wheat and gold.
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission has proposed relaxing position limits for certain trades, those settled with cash payments rather than by exchanging the actual commodity. ICE specializes in cash settlements.
Now CME is crying foul, accusing regulators of encouraging customers to flock to its competitor. The plan, CME said in an August letter to the agency, ''defies sound regulatory policy.''
''We do not believe the commission intends to increase the threat of commodity price manipulation, yet its proposal would do so.''
ICE hit back with its own hostile missive that portrayed CME, in essence, as a sore loser. ''The only party advocating for a change in the well-functioning status quo is CME, who is clearly biased regarding the issue,'' ICE said in letter to the commodity commission.
Scott O'Malia, a Republican commissioner at the agency, recently returned from a family vacation and remarked to colleagues that his school-age children were better behaved, or at least more civil, than ICE and CME. This summer, another high-ranking regulator encouraged the companies' executives to call off the public feud, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.
Later, Mr. Gensler met separately on the same day in August with Craig S. Donohue, CME's chief executive, and Jeffrey Sprecher, the head of ICE. No compromise was reached.
Regulators are also looking to find common ground at the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, another creation of Dodd-Frank.
As it prepared to open its doors in July, the bureau summoned consumer advocates and financial industry lobbyists to its Washington headquarters, soliciting their feedback on plans to regulate shadowy corners of the lending industry. At one afternoon meeting, nearly 20 officials from such varied groups as the NAACP and the Financial Services Roundtable gathered in a conference room to discuss the limits of the bureau's power.
While the American Bankers Association and other industry groups advocated broad authority over large debt collectors and the like, the Chamber of Commerce was notably silent at the meeting. Jess Sharp, an executive from the chamber, which represents both the banking industry and a wide cross section of nonbank financial firms, declined to share his opinion or drop hints about the group's position.
''My sense was that it was a tactical silence,'' said Travis Plunkett, legislative director for the Consumer Federation of America, who attended the meeting.
A month later, the chamber split with its friends in the financial world. In a letter to regulators, two top chamber executives suggested the consumer bureau ''cease all development'' of the rule until Congress approved a director to lead the agency. The letter also urged the bureau to ''tread carefully'' when spelling out which financial markets it would supervise. Officials at the consumer bureau have since met privately with the chamber, which has not retreated from its position, a person with knowledge of the matter said.
Despite the split, Mr. Sharp of the chamber says the financial industry largely speaks with one voice on Dodd-Frank.
''I have not seen serious substantive disagreements,'' he said in an interview. ''If anything, there is strong unity on the legislative reforms to Dodd-Frank.''
While they may agree on the broad strokes, the disagreements can be in the details. And with Dodd-Frank, the details are plenty.
''These types of differences happen all the time,'' said Scott Talbott, a top lobbyist for the Financial Services Roundtable. ''The financial services industry is broad and diverse and segments are often in competition with each other.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Is Wind Power Right for Vermont?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''The Not-So-Green Mountains,'' by Steve E. Wright (Op-Ed, Sept. 29):
The Green Mountain Power wind project in Lowell, Vt., has unprecedented support. Vermonters overwhelmingly want wind: 75 percent of voters in the town of Lowell supported the project, and 90 percent of Vermonters support wind, 74 percent strongly.
After years of intensive oversight, state and federal agencies have determined that this project, sited on a commercially logged mountain, will meet high standards in protecting water quality, wildlife and local ecosystems. To mitigate the effect of the 175-acre development, more than 2,000 acres of prime animal habitat will be conserved. 
Of the federal tax credits the project will receive, 100 percent go directly toward lowering the cost of power to our customers.
When completed, this project will be the most significant renewable project in Vermont, producing clean, affordable, local electricity. It will be part of Vermont's working landscape, and the benefits will flow to Vermont's environment and economy for years to come.
DOROTHY SCHNURE Manager, Corporate Communications Green Mountain Power Colchester, Vt., Sept. 29, 2011
To the Editor:
Steve E. Wright warns that wind turbines on Vermont's ridges will deter tourists who come to enjoy the state's natural beauty. Given how many of these tourists come to ski down mountain slopes stripped of natural forest, this fear seems far-fetched.
Landscape effects of wind farm development are localized, but the clean-energy gains are momentous. Nearly three-quarters of Vermont's electricity comes from the 39-year-old Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Station.
Since early last year, more than 335,000 gallons of tritium-contaminated groundwater have been pumped from wells surrounding this plant, and many Vermonters are justifiably concerned about broader health hazards as this facility continues to age.
Mr. Wright says wind power in Vermont reflects ''a misunderstanding of what a responsible society must do to slow the warming of our planet.'' Do ''green'' Vermonters really prefer continuing reliance on nuclear to the development of readily available renewable power?
PHILIP WARBURG Newton, Mass., Sept. 29, 2011
The writer is the author of the forthcoming book ''Harvest the Wind.''
To the Editor:
As a lifelong Vermonter, I totally agree with Steve E. Wright's analysis of the large-scale wind project under construction on the Lowell Mountains of our state. This project represents the triumph of big money, provided primarily through overly generous tax credits, over a creative and balanced approach to meeting our energy needs.
Electrical generation through large-scale wind projects should not be promoted as a one-size-fits-all approach. In a state with limited wind energy potential, tearing off the tops of scenic ridges to erect the tallest structures ever constructed here will have limited impact on our ability to provide carbon-free electricity, at a huge environmental and economic cost.
Vermont has a 50-year history of restricting development of pristine mountain ridges, but now, under the direction of a governor with close financial ties to the utility company that is developing this project, we are at risk of throwing away the scenic beauty that is one of our most valuable resources.
JEFFREY RAND South Burlington, Vt., Oct. 1, 2011
To the Editor:
Steve E. Wright's article is in denial of reality; he disregards the real effect of Vermont's importing almost 90 percent of its energy.
It's not an issue when it's not in your backyard. But let's be clear about what it means to oppose clean energy produced locally: it means mountaintop removal in Appalachia, oil spills in the Gulf of Mexico, the extraction of tar sands and transcontinental pipelines, and uranium mining and nuclear meltdowns.
That's not even mentioning the global effects of climate change and the effects we are already seeing, including the record flooding destruction our state felt just a month ago.
As a lifelong Vermonter, I am proud that Vermonters overwhelmingly support carefully developed wind farm projects and their role in our working landscape. Our Green Mountains will remain green in the future only with the right decisions now.
DAVID BLITTERSDORF Chief Executive, AllEarth Renewables Williston, Vt., Oct. 4, 2011
To the Editor:
Steve E. Wright questions the building of a wind farm on Lowell Mountain in Vermont. He describes this ridgeline as if it were deep wilderness; it isn't. Lowell Mountain has repeatedly been logged. But with the falling price of lumber, the family that owns it is trying to harvest wind instead of trees.
The people of Lowell, Vt., voted overwhelmingly to support this project at a town meeting. I think this is because they view this as land to be used, like a farm or a wood lot.
Admittedly, not every ridgeline should be made into a wind farm. But what is the alternative? A coal-powered plant? And to fuel that, we will lose the mountaintops of West Virginia.
Energy is everyone's problem, and the people of Lowell are to be commended for facing this, doing something and saying yes to energy in their backyards.

HEADLINE: Details Emerge on Draft Of Volcker Rule Proposal

BYLINE: By BEN PROTESS

 BODY:
Federal regulators are planning to vote next week on plans to prohibit banks from making certain lucrative, yet risky trades, the latest step toward reining in risk-taking on Wall Street in the aftermath of the financial crisis.
As the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation prepares Tuesday to vote on the so-called Volcker Rule, some clues have emerged on the details of the proposal. The American Banker on Wednesday published a document on its Web site that appeared to be the latest version of the proposed rules. The proposal spelled out the scope of the rule's ban on proprietary trading - and its broad exemptions for more routine business practices that can be mistaken for riskier trades.
But the 205-page draft proposal, dated Sept. 30 and labeled confidential, left many details to be developed in coming months. Indeed, the draft posed dozens of questions for the public and the financial industry to address, leaving the window open for significant changes. 
People close to the rulemaking cautioned late Wednesday that regulators could even make adjustments to the rule over the next week, before the F.D.I.C. votes on Tuesday. And three other federal agencies must also vote on the proposal for it to advance into a public comment period that will end in December.
Still, the F.D.I.C.'s vote will start what is sure to be a long fight over the minutiae of the Volcker Rule, a centerpiece of the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory overhaul and one of the law's most contentious provisions. Major banks have railed against the rule, saying it will eat into profits without making the financial system much safer. Many lawmakers, however, see the rule as a way to prevent future bailouts of Wall Street, which nearly collapsed during the financial crisis.
Named after Paul A. Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman who championed the rule as part of Dodd-Frank, it would order banks to limit their investments in hedge funds and private equity shops. More significant, the Volcker Rule would prohibit federally insured banks from trading for their own benefit rather than for clients, a strategy known as proprietary trading. The rule, Mr. Volcker and Democratic lawmakers say, will prevent banks from using their own capital to place bets while the government guarantees their deposits.
''Financial firms have been engaged in high-risk high-jinks that have threatened the U.S. and worldwide economy and economic recovery,'' Senator Carl Levin, the Democrat from Michigan who co-sponsored the Volcker Rule in Congress, said on Wednesday. ''The Volcker Rule is essential to protect taxpayers from banks' excessive financial risk-taking, conflicts of interest, and from the resulting billion-dollar bailouts. I look forward to reviewing the proposed rule and hope the regulators reject efforts to weaken the law.''
Banks have spent more than a year preparing for life under the Volcker Rule. Goldman Sachs was among the first major Wall Street firm to close its proprietary trading desk. JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup announced similar plans to spin off their desks, and Bank of America declared over the summer that its proprietary trading operation had closed.
But truly banning proprietary trading will take more than closing a few trading desks. The Volcker Rule exists in a gray area, where the line is often blurred between when a trade is proprietary or part of a bank's routine market-making activity, which can include buying securities with an eye toward later selling them to clients.
Dodd-Frank provides several exemptions from the ban, including underwriting, hedging and market making. The draft proposal that emerged on Wednesday would exempt even more varieties of hedging than originally expected. This summer, noting the difficulty in detecting proprietary trading, a Government Accountability Office report painted the Volcker Rule as cumbersome and tough to enforce. At the time, Mr. Levin called the G.A.O. report ''woefully incomplete.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Fifth Ave. Building On Endangered List

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
The 1954 glass box at 510 Fifth Avenue is among the cultural heritage sites at risk, according to the annual list assembled by the World Monuments Fund, which was released on Wednesday. Noting that the controversial renovation of the building at 43rd Street, a branch of what was then the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company, has been the subject of a court dispute, the fund said the case ''raises questions about the legality of recent alterations and the capacity of the New York City Landmarks Commission to enforce protective regulations.'' 
The Landmarks Preservation Committee has said it has made reasonable accommodations for a developer who needs to make the building economically viable but is otherwise restoring several of the building's historical elements.
Among the other 66 sites on the 2012 World Monuments Watch - which include 41 countries and territories - were Charleston, S.C.; the First Cemetery of Athens; and floating fishing villages in Vietnam's Ha Long Bay.
''The World Monuments Watch is a call to action on behalf of endangered cultural heritage sites across the globe,'' Bonnie Burnham, the fund's president, said in a statement. ''And while these sites are historic, they are also very much of the present - integral parts of the lives of the people who come into contact with them every day.''
At a news conference at its Empire State Building headquarters, the fund also said that American Express, the founding sponsor of the World Monuments Watch, has made a new grant of $5 million to support the program over the next five years.

PERSON: Steven P. Jobs 

HEADLINE: Redefined the Digital Age As the Visionary of Apple

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF; Steve Lohr contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Steven P. Jobs, the visionary co-founder of Apple who helped usher in the era of personal computers and then led a cultural transformation in the way music, movies and mobile communications were experienced in the digital age, died Wednesday. He was 56.
The death was announced by Apple, the company Mr. Jobs and his high school friend Stephen Wozniak started in 1976 in a suburban California garage. A friend of the family said the cause was complications of pancreatic cancer.
Mr. Jobs had waged a long and public struggle with the disease, remaining the face of the company even as he underwent treatment, introducing new products for a global market in his trademark blue jeans even as he grew gaunt and frail.
He underwent surgery in 2004, received a liver transplant in 2009 and took three medical leaves of absence as Apple's chief executive before stepping down in August and turning over the helm to Timothy D. Cook, the chief operating officer. When he left, he was still engaged in the company's affairs, negotiating with another Silicon Valley executive only weeks earlier. 
''I have always said that if there ever came a day when I could no longer meet my duties and expectations as Apple's C.E.O., I would be the first to let you know,'' Mr. Jobs said in a letter released by the company. ''Unfortunately, that day has come.''
By then, having mastered digital technology and capitalized on his intuitive marketing sense, Mr. Jobs had largely come to define the personal computer industry and an array of digital consumer and entertainment businesses centered on the Internet. He had also become a very rich man, worth an estimated $8.3 billion.
Tributes to Mr. Jobs flowed quickly on Wednesday evening, in formal statements and in the flow of social networks, with President Obama, technology industry leaders and legions of Apple fans weighing in.
''For those of us lucky enough to get to work with Steve, it's been an insanely great honor,'' said Bill Gates, the Microsoft co-founder. ''I will miss Steve immensely.''
A Twitter user named Matt Galligan wrote: ''R.I.P. Steve Jobs. You touched an ugly world of technology and made it beautiful.''
Eight years after founding Apple, Mr. Jobs led the team that designed the Macintosh computer, a breakthrough in making personal computers easier to use. After a 12-year separation from the company, prompted by a bitter falling-out with his chief executive, John Sculley, he returned in 1997 to oversee the creation of one innovative digital device after another -- the iPod, the iPhone and the iPad. These transformed not only product categories like music players and cellphones but also entire industries, like music and mobile communications.
During his years outside Apple, he bought a tiny computer graphics spinoff from the director George Lucas and built a team of computer scientists, artists and animators that became Pixar Animation Studios.
Starting with ''Toy Story'' in 1995, Pixar produced a string of hit movies, won several Academy Awards for artistic and technological excellence, and made the full-length computer-animated film a mainstream art form enjoyed by children and adults worldwide.
Mr. Jobs was neither a hardware engineer nor a software programmer, nor did he think of himself as a manager. He considered himself a technology leader, choosing the best people possible, encouraging and prodding them, and making the final call on product design.
It was an executive style that had evolved. In his early years at Apple, his meddling in tiny details maddened colleagues, and his criticism could be caustic and even humiliating. But he grew to elicit extraordinary loyalty.
''He was the most passionate leader one could hope for, a motivating force without parallel,'' wrote Steven Levy, author of the 1994 book ''Insanely Great,'' which chronicles the creation of the Mac. ''Tom Sawyer could have picked up tricks from Steve Jobs.''
''Toy Story,'' for example, took four years to make while Pixar struggled, yet Mr. Jobs never let up on his colleagues. '''You need a lot more than vision -- you need a stubbornness, tenacity, belief and patience to stay the course,'' said Edwin Catmull, a computer scientist and a co-founder of Pixar. ''In Steve's case, he pushes right to the edge, to try to make the next big step forward.''
Mr. Jobs was the ultimate arbiter of Apple products, and his standards were exacting. Over the course of a year he tossed out two iPhone prototypes, for example, before approving the third, and began shipping it in June 2007.
To his understanding of technology he brought an immersion in popular culture. In his 20s, he dated Joan Baez; Ella Fitzgerald sang at his 30th birthday party. His worldview was shaped by the '60s counterculture in the San Francisco Bay Area, where he had grown up, the adopted son of a Silicon Valley machinist. When he graduated from high school in Cupertino in 1972, he said, ''the very strong scent of the 1960s was still there.''
After dropping out of Reed College, a stronghold of liberal thought in Portland, Ore., in 1972, Mr. Jobs led a countercultural lifestyle himself. He told a reporter that taking LSD was one of the two or three most important things he had done in his life. He said there were things about him that people who had not tried psychedelics -- even people who knew him well, including his wife -- could never understand.
Decades later he flew around the world in his own corporate jet, but he maintained emotional ties to the period in which he grew up. He often felt like an outsider in the corporate world, he said. When discussing the Silicon Valley's lasting contributions to humanity, he mentioned in the same breath the invention of the microchip and ''The Whole Earth Catalog,'' a 1960s counterculture publication.
Apple's very name reflected his unconventionality. In an era when engineers and hobbyists tended to describe their machines with model numbers, he chose the name of a fruit, supposedly because of his dietary habits at the time.
Coming on the scene just as computing began to move beyond the walls of research laboratories and corporations in the 1970s, Mr. Jobs saw that computing was becoming personal -- that it could do more than crunch numbers and solve scientific and business problems -- and that it could even be a force for social and economic change. And at a time when hobbyist computers were boxy wooden affairs with metal chassis, he designed the Apple II as a sleek, low-slung plastic package intended for the den or the kitchen. He was offering not just products but a digital lifestyle.
He put much stock in the notion of ''taste,'' a word he used frequently. It was a sensibility that shone in products that looked like works of art and delighted users. Great products, he said, were a triumph of taste, of ''trying to expose yourself to the best things humans have done and then trying to bring those things into what you are doing.''
Regis McKenna, a longtime Silicon Valley marketing executive to whom Mr. Jobs turned in the late 1970s to help shape the Apple brand, said Mr. Jobs's genius lay in his ability to simplify complex, highly engineered products, ''to strip away the excess layers of business, design and innovation until only the simple, elegant reality remained.''
Mr. Jobs's own research and intuition, not focus groups, were his guide. When asked what market research went into the iPad, Mr. Jobs replied: ''None. It's not the consumers' job to know what they want.''
Early Interests
Steven Paul Jobs was born in San Francisco on Feb. 24, 1955, and surrendered for adoption by his biological parents, Joanne Carole Schieble and Abdulfattah Jandali, a graduate student from Syria who became a political science professor. He was adopted by Paul and Clara Jobs.
The elder Mr. Jobs, who worked in finance and real estate before returning to his original trade as a machinist, moved his family down the San Francisco Peninsula to Mountain View and then to Los Altos in the 1960s.
Mr. Jobs developed an early interest in electronics. He was mentored by a neighbor, an electronics hobbyist, who built Heathkit do-it-yourself electronics projects. He was brash from an early age. As an eighth grader, after discovering that a crucial part was missing from a frequency counter he was assembling, he telephoned William Hewlett, the co-founder of Hewlett-Packard. Mr. Hewlett spoke with the boy for 20 minutes, prepared a bag of parts for him to pick up and offered him a job as a summer intern.
Mr. Jobs met Mr. Wozniak while attending Homestead High School in neighboring Cupertino. The two took an introductory electronics class there.
The spark that ignited their partnership was provided by Mr. Wozniak's mother. Mr. Wozniak had graduated from high school and enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley, when she sent him an article from the October 1971 issue of Esquire magazine. The article, ''Secrets of the Little Blue Box,'' by Ron Rosenbaum, detailed an underground hobbyist culture of young men known as phone phreaks who were illicitly exploring the nation's phone system.
Mr. Wozniak shared the article with Mr. Jobs, and the two set out to track down an elusive figure identified in the article as Captain Crunch. The man had taken the name from his discovery that a whistle that came in boxes of Cap'n Crunch cereal was tuned to a frequency that made it possible to make free long-distance calls simply by blowing the whistle next to a phone handset.
Captain Crunch was John Draper, a former Air Force electronic technician, and finding him took several weeks. Learning that the two young hobbyists were searching for him, Mr. Draper had arranged to come to Mr. Wozniak's Berkeley dormitory room. Mr. Jobs, who was still in high school, had traveled to Berkeley for the meeting. When Mr. Draper arrived, he entered the room saying simply, ''It is I!''
Based on information they gleaned from Mr. Draper, Mr. Wozniak and Mr. Jobs later collaborated on building and selling blue boxes, devices that were widely used for making free -- and illegal -- phone calls. They raised a total of $6,000 from the effort.
After enrolling at Reed College in 1972, Mr. Jobs left after one semester, but remained in Portland for another 18 months auditing classes. In a commencement address given at Stanford in 2005, he said he had decided to leave college because it was consuming all of his parents' savings.
Leaving school, however, also freed his curiosity to follow his interests. ''I didn't have a dorm room,'' he said in his Stanford speech, ''so I slept on the floor in friends' rooms, I returned Coke bottles for the 5-cent deposits to buy food with, and I would walk the seven miles across town every Sunday night to get one good meal a week at the Hare Krishna temple. I loved it. And much of what I stumbled into by following my curiosity and intuition turned out to be priceless later on.''
He returned to Silicon Valley in 1974 and took a job there as a technician at Atari, the video game manufacturer. Still searching for his calling, he left after several months and traveled to India with a college friend, Daniel Kottke, who would later become an early Apple employee. Mr. Jobs returned to Atari that fall. In 1975, he and Mr. Wozniak, then working as an engineer at H.P., began attending meetings of the Homebrew Computer Club, a hobbyist group that met at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center in Menlo Park, Calif. Personal computing had been pioneered at research laboratories adjacent to Stanford, and it was spreading to the outside world.
''What I remember is how intense he looked,'' said Lee Felsenstein, a computer designer who was a Homebrew member. ''He was everywhere, and he seemed to be trying to hear everything people had to say.''
Mr. Wozniak designed the original Apple I computer simply to show it off to his friends at the Homebrew. It was Mr. Jobs who had the inspiration that it could be a commercial product.
In early 1976, he and Mr. Wozniak, using their own money, began Apple with an initial investment of $1,300; they later gained the backing of a former Intel executive, A. C. Markkula, who lent them $250,000. Mr. Wozniak would be the technical half and Mr. Jobs the marketing half of the original Apple I Computer. Starting out in the Jobs family garage in Los Altos, they moved the company to a small office in Cupertino shortly thereafter.
In April 1977, Mr. Jobs and Mr. Wozniak introduced Apple II at the West Coast Computer Faire in San Francisco. It created a sensation. Faced with a gaggle of small and large competitors in the emerging computer market, Apple, with its Apple II, had figured out a way to straddle the business and consumer markets by building a computer that could be customized for specific applications.
Sales skyrocketed, from $2 million in 1977 to $600 million in 1981, the year the company went public. By 1983 Apple was in the Fortune 500. No company had ever joined the list so quickly.
The Apple III, introduced in May 1980, was intended to dominate the desktop computer market. I.B.M. would not introduce its original personal computer until 1981. But the Apple III had a host of technical problems, and Mr. Jobs shifted his focus to a new and ultimately short-lived project, an office workstation computer code-named Lisa.
An Apocalyptic Moment
By then Mr. Jobs had made his much-chronicled 1979 visit to Xerox's research center in Palo Alto, where he saw the Alto, an experimental personal computer system that foreshadowed modern desktop computing. The Alto, controlled by a mouse pointing device, was one of the first computers to employ a graphical video display, which presented the user with a view of documents and programs, adopting the metaphor of an office desktop.
''It was one of those sort of apocalyptic moments,'' Mr. Jobs said of his visit in a 1995 oral history interview for the Smithsonian Institution. ''I remember within 10 minutes of seeing the graphical user interface stuff, just knowing that every computer would work this way someday. It was so obvious once you saw it. It didn't require tremendous intellect. It was so clear.''
In 1981 he joined a small group of Apple engineers pursuing a separate project, a lower-cost system code-named Macintosh. The machine was introduced in January 1984 and trumpeted during the Super Bowl telecast by a 60-second commercial, directed by Ridley Scott, that linked I.B.M., then the dominant PC maker, with Orwell's Big Brother.
A year earlier Mr. Jobs had lured Mr. Sculley to Apple to be its chief executive. A former Pepsi-Cola chief executive, Mr. Sculley was impressed by Mr. Jobs's pitch: ''Do you want to spend the rest of your life selling sugared water, or do you want a chance to change the world?''
He went on to help Mr. Jobs introduce a number of new computer models, including an advanced version of the Apple II and later the Lisa and Macintosh desktop computers. Through them Mr. Jobs popularized the graphical user interface, which, based on a mouse pointing device, would become the standard way to control computers.
But when the Lisa failed commercially and early Macintosh sales proved disappointing, the two men became estranged and a power struggle ensued, and Mr. Jobs lost control of the Lisa project. The board ultimately stripped him of his operational role, taking control of the Lisa project away from him, and 1,200 Apple employees were laid off. He left Apple in 1985.
''I don't wear the right kind of pants to run this company,'' he told a small gathering of Apple employees before he left, according to a member of the original Macintosh development team. He was barefoot as he spoke, and wearing blue jeans.
That September he announced a new venture, NeXT Inc. The aim was to build a workstation computer for the higher-education market. The next year, the Texas industrialist H. Ross Perot invested $20 million in the effort. But it did not achieve Mr. Jobs's goals.
Mr. Jobs also established a personal philanthropic foundation after leaving Apple but soon had a change of heart, deciding instead to spend much of his fortune -- $10 million -- on acquiring Pixar, a struggling graphics supercomputing company owned by the filmmaker George Lucas.
The purchase was a significant gamble; there was little market at the time for computer-animated movies. But that changed in 1995, when the company, with Walt Disney Pictures, released ''Toy Story.'' That film's box-office receipts ultimately reached $362 million, and when Pixar went public in a record-breaking offering, Mr. Jobs emerged a billionaire. In 2006, the Walt Disney Company agreed to purchase Pixar for $7.4 billion. The sale made Mr. Jobs Disney's largest single shareholder, with about 7 percent of the company's stock.
His personal life also became more public. He had a number of well-publicized romantic relationships, including one with the folk singer Joan Baez, before marrying Laurene Powell. In 1996, his sister Mona Simpson, a novelist, threw a spotlight on her relationship with Mr. Jobs in the novel ''A Regular Guy.'' The two did not meet until they were adults. The novel centered on a Silicon Valley entrepreneur who bore a close resemblance to Mr. Jobs. It was not an entirely flattering portrait. Mr. Jobs said about a quarter of it was accurate.
''We're family,'' he said of Ms. Simpson in an interview with The New York Times Magazine. ''She's one of my best friends in the world. I call her and talk to her every couple of days.''
His wife and Ms. Simpson survive him, as do his three children with Ms. Powell, his daughters Eve Jobs and Erin Sienna Jobs and a son, Reed; another daughter, Lisa Brennan-Jobs, from a relationship with Chrisann Brennan; and another sister, Patti Jobs.
Return to Apple
Eventually, Mr. Jobs refocused NeXT from the education to the business market and dropped the hardware part of the company, deciding to sell just an operating system. Although NeXT never became a significant computer industry player, it had a huge impact: a young programmer, Tim Berners-Lee, used a NeXT machine to develop the first version of the World Wide Web at the Swiss physics research center CERN in 1990.
In 1996, after unsuccessful efforts to develop next-generation operating systems, Apple, with Gilbert Amelio now in command, acquired NeXT for $430 million. The next year, Mr. Jobs returned to Apple as an adviser. He became chief executive again in 2000.
Shortly after returning, Mr. Jobs publicly ended Apple's long feud with its archrival Microsoft, which agreed to continue developing its Office software for the Macintosh and invested $150 million in Apple.
Once in control of Apple again, Mr. Jobs set out to reshape the consumer electronics industry. He pushed the company into the digital music business, introducing first iTunes and then the iPod MP3 player. The music arm grew rapidly, reaching almost 50 percent of the company's revenue by June 2008.
In 2005, Mr. Jobs announced that he would end Apple's business relationship with I.B.M. and Motorola and build Macintosh computers based on Intel microprocessors.
His fight with cancer was now publicly known. Apple had announced in 2004 that Mr. Jobs had a rare but curable form of pancreatic cancer and that he had undergone successful surgery. Four years later, questions about his health returned when he appeared at a company event looking gaunt. Afterward, he said he had suffered from a ''common bug.'' Privately, he said his cancer surgery had created digestive problems but insisted they were not life-threatening.
Apple began selling the iPhone in June 2007. Mr. Jobs's goal was to sell 10 million of the handsets in 2008, equivalent to 1 percent of the global cellphone market. The company sold 11.6 million.
Although smartphones were already commonplace, the iPhone dispensed with a stylus and pioneered a touch-screen interface that quickly set the standard for the mobile computing market. Rolled out with much anticipation and fanfare, iPhone rocketed to popularity; by the end of 2010 the company had sold almost 90 million units.
Although Mr. Jobs took just a nominal $1 salary when he returned to Apple, his compensation became the source of a Silicon Valley scandal in 2006 over the backdating of millions of shares of stock options. But after a company investigation and one by the Securities and Exchange Commission, he was found not to have benefited financially from the backdating and no charges were brought.
The episode did little to taint Mr. Jobs's standing in the business and technology world. As the gravity of his illness became known, and particularly after he announced he was stepping down, he was increasingly hailed for his genius and true achievement: his ability to blend product design and business market innovation by integrating consumer-oriented software, microelectronic components, industrial design and new business strategies in a way that has not been matched.
If he had a motto, it may have come from ''The Whole Earth Catalog,'' which he said had deeply influenced him as a young man. The book, he said in his commencement address at Stanford in 2005, ends with the admonition ''Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.''
''I have always wished that for myself,'' he said.

HEADLINE: After Summer of Speculation, Palin Says She Won't Join the 2012 Race

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR

 BODY:
UPDATE, 6:35 p.m.: Sarah Palin is not running for president.
Ms. Palin, the former governor of Alaska, ended her inscrutable cat-and-mouse game with the political establishment on Wednesday afternoon by saying that she would not join the field of Republican candidates seeking her party's nomination, but would still work to oust President Obama.
''Not being a candidate, you are unshackled and able to be even more active,'' she said on ''The Mark Levin Show''. ''I look forward to using all the tools at my disposal to get the right people in there who have a servant's heart.''
The decision from Ms. Palin on Wednesday placed a punctuation mark on the Republican presidential field. Her intentions were the biggest remaining question in the race. While there was not a groundswell of support among Republican leaders for a Palin candidacy, she has a deeply loyal following. 
Her announcement, which took the Republican world by surprise, was vintage Palin. It also raised the question of how intensely she plans to be involved in the race and whether she intends to endorse a candidate or simply be a commentator, cheerleader or critic.
For a year, Ms. Palin had given many signals that she would not run. She has repeatedly suggested that she could have a bigger influence if she was not a candidate. But her supporters were convinced that she was running. A Labor Day weekend appearance in Iowa drew boosters from across the country, most of whom said they were certain she would run.
The immediate effect of her decision to stay on the sidelines was minimal. Yet the long-term impact is less certain. As she demonstrated in the successful Republican midterm elections last year, her endorsement was a hot ticket.
Her late decision comes a day after Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey announced that he, too, would take a pass on a presidential bid.
Ms. Palin, who rocketed to fame as the Republican vice-presidential nominee in 2008, said she still intended to use her celebrity status to wield political influence without the support of a Republican infrastructure that is wary of her powerful but unorthodox appeal.
Speaking on the radio show, Ms. Palin said that she intended to continue waging a ''mission to help wake up America to what's going on in this country.''
''I can be more effective and more aggressive in this mission'' without being a candidate, she said.
''I need to be able to say what I want to say,'' she added, and to ''call out the wrongheadedness of our leaders who are leading us down this path. Let us unite to restore this country.''
In an e-mail sent to her supporters, Ms. Palin said she had decided not to run out of respect for her family and the impact that a campaign would have on them.
''As always, my family comes first and obviously Todd and I put great consideration into family life before making this decision,'' she wrote, referring to her husband. ''When we serve, we devote ourselves to God, family and country. My decision maintains this order.''
She said in the e-mail that she would remain politically active.
''I will continue driving the discussion for freedom and free markets, including in the race for president where our candidates must embrace immediate action toward energy independence through domestic resource developments of conventional energy sources, along with renewables,'' she wrote. ''We must reduce tax burdens and onerous regulations that kill American industry, and our candidates must always push to minimize government to strengthen the economy and allow the private sector to create jobs.''
Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, whose candidacy could benefit the most from her decision, called Ms. Palin ''a good friend, a great American and a true patriot.''
''I respect her decision and know she will continue to be a strong voice for conservative values and needed change in Washington,'' he said in a statement.
Aides to Ms. Palin have said for months that a Palin campaign would have largely ignored the usual political traditions in favor of an effort designed to communicate directly with the public through Ms. Palin's Facebook page and Twitter feed, which combine to reach millions of followers.
Ms. Palin has used those forums, as well as her contract as a prominent Fox News analyst, to maintain her position as one of the leading conservative voices in the Republican Party during the last several years. In the 2010 midterm elections, her endorsement served as a powerful indication of support from the Tea Party movement, which Ms. Palin has adopted has her own.
She has also become one of the fiercest critics of Mr. Obama's policies at a time that Republican voters are longing for someone who can reclaim the White House from the Democratic Party.
''Barack Obama has shown us cronyism on steroids,'' she said in and Iowa speech on Labor Day. ''It will lead to our downfall if we don't stop it now. The challenge is not simply to replace Obama in 2012. The real challenge is who and what we will replace him with. It's not enough to just change up the uniform. If we don't change the team and the game plan, we won't save our country.''
The question of whether Ms. Palin would join the 2012 presidential race had been one of the most intriguing - and hotly debated - among veteran political observers in Washington. Many assumed that she would decide against a bid because of her financial success as a best-selling author, political commentator and reality TV star.
There was also the experience of the 2008 campaign, which served as a brutal entry onto the national political stage for Ms. Palin and her family. In three intense months, her intelligence was mocked, her family was scrutinized and she developed a searing distrust of political consultants and the national press corps.
Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who picked Ms. Palin to be his vice-presidential nominee in 2008, went to Twitter Wednesday evening to comment: ''I am confident she'll continue to play an important role in our Party and for our nation.''
Until her announcement, there have been plenty of clues that Ms. Palin was intent on keeping alive the possibility of a presidential campaign.
Her two best-selling books served as responses to the mockery she received as a candidate for vice president and as the beginnings of a platform from which she could build a political identity separate from Senator McCain.
She continued both efforts as a highly-paid public speaker -- reportedly earning as much as $100,000 a speech -- and as a highly paid analyst for Fox News. She also built an online presence that rivals almost every other national politician. Her commentary on Twitter and Facebook regularly get more attention than most officeholders.
And earlier this year, Ms. Palin began a thinly veiled test of what it might be like to campaign for president by taking her family on visits to historic American landmarks in her ''One Nation'' bus tour.
Ms. Palin insisted that the bus tour was more family vacation than political exercise. But her small circle of aides made little effort to disabuse journalists of the idea that the bus tour was designed to lay the groundwork for a possible campaign.
The tour also proved Ms. Palin's devilish side. She took the bus into New Hampshire just as Mitt Romney formally announced his campaign in the state. And she suddenly arrived at the Iowa State Fair on the day before the Republican straw poll in Ames.
A campaign would have tested her political appeal as she began campaigning alongside her rivals for the nomination, Michele Bachmann, Mr. Romney and Mr. Perry. There are barely three months until the voting begins in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina early next year, and Ms. Palin would have started with almost no formal campaign infrastructure in any of those states.
A campaign would have tested Ms. Palin's ability to quickly raise millions of dollars necessary to finance a modern presidential campaign. Those closest to her have said they believed donations from her many admirers around the country would have rapidly poured in over the Internet.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: E-Mails Suggest White House Weighed a 2nd Solyndra Loan Worth Almost Half a Billion Dollars

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Early last year, the Obama administration was so optimistic about the business prospects of Solyndra, the solar equipment manufacturer that declared bankruptcy last month after receiving a $528 million government loan, that officials entertained the possibility of giving the California company a second loan of almost half a billion dollars, according to internal e-mails. 
Solyndra ceased operations on Aug. 31 after lengthy financial difficulties, and the circumstances of the company's failure are now being scrutinized by Congress, the Energy Department's inspector general and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. On Wednesday, House Republicans expanded their investigation and asked the White House for documents related to Solyndra going back to the time of the president's inauguration.
According to documents provided to Republican investigators, in January 2010, a Solyndra lobbyist e-mailed a White House aide and referred to their conversation about a ''phase 2 loan guarantee application'' that was ''poised to impact jobs creation in 2010 on the order of doubling our Phase 1 jobs.''
Late Tuesday, House Democrats released an e-mail exchange between officials of the Office of Management and Budget on May 24, 2010, that suggested the second application was for $469 million. President Obama visited the factory on the next day, despite growing concerns about the company's financial problems.
The first loan, which was provided under a loan guarantee program for alternative energy projects passed as part of the 2009 stimulus law, helped the company build a factory in Fremont, Calif., that produced 3,000 temporary construction jobs. Another 1,000 people worked in the plant until it shut down. Solyndra, which bet on an expensive new technology for solar power arrays, could not compete against cheaper panels made using more traditional techniques.
An Energy Department spokesman said on Wednesday that Solyndra's second loan application did not go far.
''The career staff at the department had only barely begun to do the due diligence that would have been required for a second loan,'' said the spokesman, Damon LaVera. ''This application would have had to undergo many more months of analysis before being approved, but the department and Solyndra mutually agreed that the application should not receive further consideration'' until the first factory was completed.
Solyndra got conditional approval for its first loan in March 2009. In August of that year, an Energy Department official predicted in an internal e-mail that the company would run out of cash in September 2011.
In December 2009, just before the lobbyist's e-mail about the second loan, a venture capitalist who had put money into Solyndra e-mailed Lawrence H. Summers, then the president's top economic adviser, to say that a loan guarantee for the company was ''good for us,'' but that ''I can't imagine it's a good way for the government to use taxpayer money.''

HEADLINE: Budget Presses Obama Aide Into Political Fight

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- When President Obama recruited William M. Daley, a business-friendly banker with a Democratic pedigree to be his chief of staff 10 months ago, Mr. Daley seemed like the right man for a White House determined to cut deals with resurgent Republicans in Congress.
Now Mr. Daley finds himself commanding a White House staff that has put its president on war footing with the opposition. It is an awkward turn of events for a man who seems more comfortable negotiating with Republicans than excoriating them, as Mr. Obama has over the last couple of weeks, as cold-hearted defenders of the rich. 
''The nation is being pushed into that, by the Republican primaries, by the type of 'my-way-or-the-highway' language in Congress,'' Mr. Daley said in an interview, sounding less like an eager warrior than a frustrated negotiator pressed into combat.
Burned by Washington after failed budget talks with House leaders, he and another influential White House adviser, David Plouffe, are hoping to chart a presidential comeback that relies less on legislative accomplishments than on selling a vision of America that contrasts sharply with that of the Republicans.
Whether the two men succeed and engineer a second term for Mr. Obama will depend on what lessons they absorbed from a brutal year in the White House and whether a new strategy can win back Democrats and other voters frustrated by the idea that the president wasted time trying to strike deals with lawmakers who showed little interest in helping him achieve results on anything other than their terms.
''Thirty Tea Party House Republicans are being put before 300 million Americans,'' Mr. Plouffe said, referring to the lawmakers he blamed for blocking a deal between the president and Speaker John A. Boehner that would have reduced the debt by $4 trillion over two decades. ''It's a big problem for the country.''
Both officials are haunted by that failed deal -- a missed opportunity that seems to loom larger in the White House with each passing day. It was the biggest of several miscalculations by the White House -- the messy effort to schedule Mr. Obama's speech to Congress serving as an embarrassing coda -- and it left the president's advisers looking as if they had failed to appreciate the depth of Republican resistance to his proposals.
But the greatest casualty may be the president's cherished image as a post-partisan leader, one carefully cultivated since he first stepped onto the national stage in 2004 vowing to heal the rift between red and blue America.
On Tuesday, in Texas, Mr. Obama was a full-throated partisan, assailing the House Republican leader, Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, for not allowing a vote on the administration's $450 billion jobs bill. ''Does he not believe in tax breaks for small businesses or efforts to help our veterans?'' the president said to a whipped-up crowd at a college near Dallas.
The new approach, officials said, is being driven by polling data that shows that when Mr. Obama lays out his differences with Congress in a vivid fashion, voters tend to embrace the president's approach.
While Mr. Daley and Mr. Plouffe are most directly responsible for this strategy, with help from outside advisers like David Axelrod, they come at it from sharply different perspectives.
Mr. Daley, 63, a commerce secretary in the Clinton administration whose father and brother were legendary Chicago mayors, is desperate to restore the confidence that he says was lost after the failure to reach a bipartisan agreement on the deficit. He said he pushed for the biggest possible job-creation bill to prevent the economy from relapsing.
In his West Wing corner office, Mr. Daley keeps his television tuned to CNBC to keep track of how the fiscal battles are playing in the financial markets.
Mr. Plouffe, 44, the disciplined strategist who managed Mr. Obama's last campaign and who is now his senior political adviser, switches on the TV in his office only when the president is speaking. More so than Mr. Daley, who did not know Mr. Obama well before taking his job, Mr. Plouffe is deeply, emotionally invested in the president's re-election.
''We feel confident that we have a path to victory,'' he said. But he acknowledged that ''when you have this turbulence in the global economy, you're not going to be able to tactically, magically change the political situation.''
Both advisers start with another stark premise: the odds of the White House's agreeing on anything major with Congress in the next 13 months are slim, though Republicans are trying to move quickly on three new trade deals the White House sent to Capitol Hill on Monday.
Faced with a Republican Party that officials said was in ''campaign mode,'' Mr. Obama has gone in a similar direction, hawking his jobs bill to students, high-tech executives and celebrities.
The message, Mr. Plouffe said, is that the president is fighting for the middle class, and to restore the economy, against a Republican Party that he says is more intent on preserving tax breaks for millionaires, hedge fund owners and corporations.
''The American people will have a choice about the direction they want to take the economy,'' he said. ''Do they want, basically, a Gordon Gekko economy? Or do they want a president who says, 'Every decision I make is focused on the middle class?' ''
There is little of that populist fire in Mr. Daley, who sprinkles his comments with references to Warren E. Buffett, prominent bankers and executives who troop through his office to voice frustration about the political stalemate or to diagnose the economy.
Mr. Daley does not have close ties to Congress -- in contrast to his predecessor, Rahm Emanuel, a former House member who worked his old colleagues aggressively to pass legislation.
That has prompted criticism from top lawmakers and Congressional aides who say the White House aggravated its problems during the debt-ceiling debate by not cultivating influential Democrats and by assuming that Mr. Boehner could bring his Tea Party ranks into line.
In that debate, Mr. Plouffe said, the White House had little choice but to strike an agreement because ''there was a sword of Damocles hanging over the American economy.''
''We don't have that anymore,'' he said. ''If Congress doesn't act, particularly if the Republicans in Congress don't act, to help create jobs for the middle class, we're going to make sure people know why that is.''

HEADLINE: Haiti's New Prime Minister Emphasizes the Need for Jobs

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (Reuters) -- In Haiti, the Americas' poorest state, the top priority of the incoming prime minister is no different from that of the leader of the world's richest economy, the United States, just a two-hour flight away. 
''Jobs, jobs, jobs,'' the new prime minister, Garry Conille, said in an interview hours after the Haitian Senate ratified him as the new head of the government. He was nominated by President Michel Martelly.
The Senate's confirmation late on Tuesday of Mr. Conille, 45, a doctor and a United Nations development expert, came as a relief to foreign governments and donors and followed the rejection by lawmakers of two previous nominations by Mr. Martelly, who won a presidential election runoff in March.
Donors have been eagerly awaiting the installation of a prime minister to tackle the reconstruction of Haiti after the devastating earthquake in January 2010 that killed more than 300,000 people and destroyed much of Port-au-Prince, the capital.
Haiti's estimated unemployment rate last year was 41 percent, according to the Central Intelligence Agency's World Factbook, and more than two-thirds of Haitians who are of working age do not have formal jobs.
In addition, 80 percent of Haiti's population lives under the poverty line, with 54 percent in abject poverty, according to the intelligence agency's factbook.
Mr. Conille, who has worked on development projects in several African states for the United Nations, said he was confident that he could rally both Haitians and international donors behind a government program that he said he intended to submit to Parliament for approval.
''This will be a battle in some ways,'' he said, adding that it will also represent ''a unique and historical opportunity to put all Haitians together around a common program to rebuild their country.''
He said he planned to seek political diversity and inclusiveness in his cabinet, not always easy in a volatile nation often torn by fighting between political factions. ''No sector will be excluded,'' he said in the interview in his office in Port-au-Prince. ''We will all share responsibilities around a common vision to get the country out of this difficult situation.''
Mr. Conille said he had no illusions about the enormousness of the task facing the government. Nearly 21 months after the earthquake, many Haitians are still homeless, jobless and destitute.
''Not only did the earthquake hit one of the poorest countries in the world, but it hit the center of the country's activities, which is Port-au-Prince, crippling the government, private sector, businesses, banks,'' he said.
Mr. Conille also served as chief of staff to former President Bill Clinton in Mr. Clinton's role as special United Nations Haiti envoy.
Echoing pledges made by his political sponsor, Mr. Martelly, Mr. Conille said he would seek to spread the rebuilding and development efforts and resources evenly between the capital and rural Haiti, where half the population lives.
He acknowledged that the reconstruction process initiated by the government after the earthquake, bolstered by pledges of billions of dollars in aid from donors, had fallen short so far of the expectations and needs of the Haitian people.

HEADLINE: A Candidate Writing His Own Campaign Rules

BYLINE: By SUSAN SAULNY; Michael D. Shear contributed reporting.

 BODY:
On a whirlwind trip through New York City this week that marked the beginning of a nearly monthlong book tour, Herman Cain chatted with the hosts of ABC's ''The View,'' promoted his new memoir on Fox News, met local titans like Donald Trump, shared ideas with former Mayor Edward I. Koch and enjoyed power lunching in Midtown.
Mr. Cain, a contender for the Republican presidential nomination, did all but one thing -- campaign. Not in the traditional meet-the-public and kiss-the-babies sense, anyway.
And according to his public campaign calendar of events, where 19 of the 31 days of October are blank, there will not be much glad-handing in the immediate future. That is just fine with Mr. Cain, a former business executive who has recently surged to the top tier of candidates in early polls. The latest Quinnipiac University poll, released Wednesday, found Mitt Romney and Mr. Cain essentially tied within the poll's margin of sampling error. 
''I'm trying to run this campaign like a start-up business, which means lean and mean,'' Mr. Cain said in an interview on Tuesday, wearing his signature black cowboy hat. ''There's a new sheriff in town.''
This could be Mr. Cain's moment. With Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey taking a pass and Gov. Rick Perry of Texas struggling, the yearning for a candidate who can combine fiery conservative populism with concrete policy proposals has led a growing section of Republican voters to embrace, or at least take a hard look at, Mr. Cain.
He has an eclectic, intriguing resume: chief executive of Godfather's Pizza, conservative radio host and chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Mo.
And Mr. Cain can stir up a crowd of conservative activists, as his recent victory at a Florida straw poll displayed. After hours of polite applause during the speeches of the other Republican candidates, the audience of several thousand exploded with enthusiasm during Mr. Cain's full-throated critique of American political inaction.
''Throw out all of the current tax code because it is a mess that cannot be fixed. Throw that out!'' he said, describing his plans for a flat tax of 9 percent on businesses, personal income and sales. ''It provides some certainty to the engine of economic growth, which is a business sector -- not the government! Nine, nine, nine!'' (The crowd chanted along, ''Nine, nine, nine!'')
But it is not clear that Mr. Cain, 65, has any particular plan to seize this moment, beyond using the attention to sell books. Like the other candidates vying to become credible alternatives to Mr. Romney and Mr. Perry, Mr. Cain is operating on a shoestring. He raised $2 million last spring. More money is coming in, he said, and he has 40 staff members, mostly in Southern states. Still, an adviser to the campaign said the campaign had only four people working in Iowa, and there is no plan to change strategy.
Many Republicans doubt this will be enough to launch Mr. Cain in the crucial early states, especially if he decides to avoid retail politics.
''No candidate can afford to spend two or three weeks not being in New Hampshire this year,'' said Steve Duprey, a Republican National Committee member from the state. ''He has not made as much progress organizing in New Hampshire as he could have, but there's time.''
When asked why he would launch a book tour while running for the presidential nomination, Mr. Cain said that ''the two complement one another'' and that the benefits go beyond raising his name recognition among voters -- one of his main goals.
''It was a gamble on the part of Simon & Schuster,'' he said. ''They get kudos for believing in me and this campaign. Now they're going to cash in. That's the way it works.''
The publishing house is not the only beneficiary, of course. So is Mr. Cain, whose most recent occupation is that of professional keynote speaker. His fee is $25,000 a speech. He also runs his own leadership consulting company. The two roles continue to play a large part in his daily schedule, which is why his October campaign plans seem so spare, he explained. Mr. Cain said there was also a good bit of fund-raising happening behind the scenes.
Mr. Cain rejected the suggestion that he was not taking the early primary states seriously enough, saying he had made 28 trips to Iowa since the beginning of the year. ''We have a strong base there and will be going back,'' he said. ''We didn't have a front-loaded Iowa-New Hampshire strategy. No, we've got a multistate strategy, so we'll get back to Iowa in due time.''
And in 2012, a front-loading of primaries in Southern states like South Carolina and Florida might benefit a candidate with a Southern focus, like Mr. Cain.
If his book tour is in some ways a proxy for a campaign, his strategy appears clear: the tour's first stop after New York is in the Orlando, Fla., area, followed by signings in Texas, Virginia, South Carolina and Tennessee. These are some of the same states where Mr. Cain describes his organization as strong.
But he admits to needing a bigger operation. And his director of communications quit last week.
''We are staffing up now because within the last week and a half, our contributions have gone up,'' he said. ''We've always had plans to add more staff, but I didn't want to add them if I couldn't afford them.''
Mr. Cain estimated that donations were up tenfold, ''and that might be low now considering what's happening in the last few days.''
The campaign says that 75 percent of donors have contributed $100 or less. ''My mood is a lot better these days because the mainstream media has finally figured out that they're not going to determine who the top two candidates are,'' Mr. Cain said. ''The voters are going to determine that. I wake up in the morning excited and thrilled, and looking forward to the day.''
His 222-page book, ''This Is Herman Cain! My Journey to the White House,'' came out on Tuesday and by Wednesday evening was the ninth-most popular book as rated by Amazon. Mr. Cain said it took about three months to finish, with the help of professional writers.
In the book, which is written in the highly enthusiastic style of a motivational manual, replete with many exclamation points (favorite pizza: ''Deep dish!''), Mr. Cain touches on his career highlights, family and health. (Of his Stage 4 colon and liver cancer: ''Cured!'')
But he does not drill deeply, spending only a few paragraphs on the death of his brother from complications of drug and alcohol abuse, and that of his father, who died while Mr. Cain was at a business reception. ''I just sat there for a few minutes and prayed,'' he writes. ''Then I collected myself and returned to the reception.''
The most political parts of the book are the chapters ''The Cain Doctrine'' and ''The Cain Administration: The First Ninety Days.'' On immigration, abortion and taxes, Mr. Cain charts an extremely conservative path that has no surprises. He admits to not having answers about foreign policy. ''I think a president should be briefed on classified intelligence about America's relationships before offering opinions,'' he writes.
As president, he would insist that White House personnel have a copy of the Constitution nearby, would be on the lookout for signs that Shariah law is infiltrating American courts, and -- perhaps in a true sign of self-confidence -- would cut the number of inaugural balls in half.
''Balls are a waste of time!'' he said. ''That's why I'm not going to do 18 inaugural balls, I already told my staff. It's going to be quite an honor to be president of the United States. But I am less concerned about the pomp and circumstance. I don't need it.''

HEADLINE: With Rare Double U.N. Veto on Syria, Russia and China Try to Shield Friend

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR; Michael Schwirtz contributed reporting from Moscow.

 BODY:
UNITED NATIONS -- By vetoing a Security Council resolution condemning Syria for its oppression of antigovernment forces, Russia and China effectively tossed a life preserver to President Bashar al-Assad, seemingly unwilling to see a pivotal ally and once stalwart member of the socialist bloc sink beneath the waves of the Arab Spring.
A double veto at the United Nations is rare, in this case driven by similar if not exactly parallel concerns in Moscow and Beijing about losing influence in the Arab world as one authoritarian government after another built on the now-faded Soviet model collapses. 
''They are gambling that Assad can hold on now; it seems to be an expression of confidence that he can cling to power,'' said Fiona Hill, a Russia expert at the Brookings Institution.
Russia enjoys military and commercial deals with Syria worth billions of dollars annually, plus its alliance and only reliable Arab friend give it an entree into the Arab-Israeli peace negotiations. In addition, Moscow maintains perks left over from its superpower days, for instance, a naval base at Tartus, Syria, that accommodates visits by warships like Peter the Great, a nuclear-powered missile cruiser, during its Mediterranean jaunts.
China worries that the reverberations from falling Arab despots will inspire civil disobedience at home.
But beyond those concerns, and a stated interest in averting violent change in Syria, China and Russia are also increasingly allied in shutting down what they see as Western efforts to use sanctions and other economic measures to put the United Nations seal of approval on Western-friendly regime change.
There is a sense in both capitals that the West in general, and the United States in particular, is feeding the protest movements in the Arab world to further its own interests, experts said. Both the Chinese and the Russians are determined to reassert their long opposition to anything that smacks of domestic meddling by outside powers.
In that effort they have been joined by emerging powers like Brazil, India and South Africa, which have formed their own alliance and as current members of the Security Council all abstained from the Syria vote late Tuesday. Lebanon, where Syria holds sway, also abstained.
The resolution itself was toothless, demanding that the violence in Syria stop. The draft underwent repeated dilutions, which dropped all but the most vague reference to sanctions as a future possibility. But even that drew objections, in part because the cloud of Libya cast a long shadow over the Syria deliberations. The Russians and the Chinese said they felt bamboozled after a resolution they thought was meant to protect Libyan civilians became what they condemned as a license to wage war on the government of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi. They are determined to avoid that in the Middle East and anywhere else.
Western diplomats said the consequences of the Libyan resolution were clearly laid out before the March vote.
Vitaly Churkin, the Russian ambassador, told the Security Council on Tuesday night in his speech explaining the veto, ''The demand for a rapid cease-fire turned into a full-fledged civil war.'' He said that NATO bombed targets like television stations and oil facilities that were not a military threat to civilians.
Mr. Churkin said the veto was prompted by political differences over the use of force endorsed by the Council, rather than Syria's long ties to the Soviet Union and any economic or arms sales losses. Indeed, Mr. Churkin seemed to go out of his way after the vote to distance Russia from the bloodshed fomented by the Syrian government while noting that unlike others, Moscow does not ''cast aside old allies in a single breath.''
But there is a long history of close military and commercial ties. Hafez al-Assad, the current president's father, was educated in Moscow and relied on the Soviet Union for weapons during the many Arab-Israeli wars. He died in 2000. Reports by Russian news outlets put current arms contracts at $4 billion. Beyond jet fighters and tanks, Russia has varied interests in Syria, like oil and gas and cement. Russia is ranked as the country's fifth-largest trading partner, experts said.
''The departure of Assad would cause serious problems for us,'' Aleksandr Sharavin, director of the Institute for Political and Military Analysis in Moscow, told the Prime-Tass news agency, noting that not just weapons sales but also maintenance contracts bring in large sums.
The Russian foreign minister issued a statement on Wednesday echoing the Syrian government line, condemning what it called extremists among the population for engaging in ''open terror'' through violent attacks.
''Assad simply has a better chance to resist than the opposition does to win,'' Aleksandr Shumilin, director of the Center for the Analysis of Middle East Conflicts, told the BBC Russian service. Moscow, he said, ''is betting on Assad. As soon as it seems that the opposition has become comparable to him in strength and there appears a possibility they will win, Russia will change its behavior.''
In many ways, Russian's foreign policy machinery exists in a black box. But in the background, the looming shadow of Vladimir V. Putin's returning to the presidency next year has to enter the calculus. ''Everyone is reorienting toward the relatively more competitive attitude he had toward rolling back Western influence,'' said Matthew Rojansky of the Carnegie Endowment.
As for the Chinese, it is exceedingly rare for them to exercise a veto. They would not have done it without Russia's leading the way, Security Council diplomats said, and indeed the Chinese delegation told other diplomats that it was under pressure from Moscow not to abstain.
But the move coincides with numerous goals, experts said, including protecting commercial interests, avoiding any domestic contagion from the Arab Spring and choosing the status quo over an unpredictable future. ''Their operative approach is 'Just Say No,' to stand in the way for fear they will lose what influence or control they have,'' said Jonathan D. Pollack of Brookings.
Often when a great power exercises a veto to protect a client state, like the United States so often does for Israel, the issue disappears. But the Syria issue is likely to return, mainly because the country remains volatile and important neighbors like Turkey and the Arab League states want the issue addressed.
''We can all understand the push back against Western domination of the sanctions approach,'' said George Lopez, a sanctions expert at the University of Notre Dame. ''But sanctions at their best -- sharp, targeted at the elites giving orders for the killing of civilians -- can be effective.''

 BODY:
SUBPRIME CARDS Two contrasting images of Capital One -- subprime credit card company or benevolent bank -- were presented Wednesday at a Federal Reserve hearing on its planned acquisition of ING Direct USA. To hear consumer advocates tell it, Capital One is an aggressive credit card company that preys on low-income borrowers. 
But Capital One argued that this was not the case. ''Responsible lending to these borrowers is not only acceptable, but also provides a source of credit and purchasing power for these customers,'' said its general counsel, John Finneran, above. But he did acknowledge that about a third of its credit card portfolio was subprime.

NOT A FOND FAREWELL Edouard Carmignac, below, the founder of the French money manager Carmignac Gestion, took out ads in four European newspapers for an open letter to Jean-Claude Trichet, who is retiring as president the European Central Bank. The letter starts out: ''Farewell, you certainly won't be missed!''
In the letter, Mr. Carmignac urged Mr. Trichet to cut short-term interest rates to zero percent from 1.5 percent.

HEADLINE: Quinn, Pulled 2 Ways on Wage Bill, Delays Taking a Stand

BYLINE: By KATE TAYLOR

 BODY:
Christine C. Quinn, the City Council speaker, facing conflicting pressures from her longtime labor allies and her new supporters in the business community, said Wednesday that she was not ready to take a position on a controversial proposal that would require employers who benefit from city subsidies to pay workers higher wages.
Ms. Quinn's reluctance to express an opinion on the so-called living wage bill at a news conference comes at a time when many of her positions are being closely watched because she is a prospective candidate for mayor in 2013. She also kept her distance from the Occupy Wall Street protests, even as some on the Council joined union members in a march on Wednesday. The speaker said that she felt sympathy with Americans who were worried about the economy, but that she was not sure what the protesters' agenda was and that she would not be visiting them. 
Ms. Quinn, a Democrat, has a cooperative relationship with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, an independent, and is widely viewed as his preferred successor. She recently quashed a measure opposed by Mr. Bloomberg that would have required mayors to disclose to the public when they were traveling far from the city. But on Wednesday, she shepherded a measure through the Council that would require greater scrutiny when the city outsourced contracts; Mr. Bloomberg opposes the bill, and he is expected to veto it.
On the living wage measure, Ms. Quinn said she had not yet seen proposed revisions by advocates for the bill, who have rewritten their proposal in response to concerns from the business community.
Although the advocates have described the changes they were making publicly and in a memorandum to Ms. Quinn's staff, she said she would not be ready to respond until they filed a revised bill.
''Up until there are actually written amendments for me to read and review, I cannot tell you what I think,'' she said, her voice rising in response to repeated questions about the issue. ''Because my job as speaker is to pass or not pass legislation. My job as speaker is to opine on legislation. There is no legislation. There are no amendments.''
The original living wage legislation -- introduced last year by two council members from the Bronx, G. Oliver Koppell and Annabel Palma -- would have required that employees working on city-subsidized projects be paid at least $10 an hour with benefits, or $11.50 an hour without benefits. The state minimum wage is $7.25 an hour.
The measure had the support of a majority of the Council, along with that of a coalition of labor leaders, antipoverty advocates and clergy members. But Mr. Bloomberg and business leaders opposed the bill, arguing that it would cost the city jobs, and Ms. Quinn never brought it to a vote.
In an effort to resurrect the measure, its supporters said this week that they would revise it to exclude manufacturing firms and small businesses from the wage requirements.
Mr. Bloomberg is, however, still opposed.
''We've got to attract jobs in this city, and the marketplace is going to set the compensation,'' he said Wednesday. ''The last time people tried to set rates, basically, was in the Soviet Union, and that didn't work out very well. I don't think we want to go in that direction.''
On Wednesday, the city's Economic Development Corporation released a study of the living wage proposal, declaring that in cities where similar measures had been adopted, employment among low-skilled workers fell by about 2.2 percent as a result. Based on that finding, the study predicted that the bill being considered by the Council would result in the loss of 6,000 to 13,000 low-skilled jobs.
''This study shows clearly that while wage mandates may raise income for a few, they also result in significant job losses and reduced private investment for many,'' said Julie Wood, a spokeswoman for the mayor.
But supporters of the measure criticized the study.
''This million-dollar report is so flawed it's not worth the bandwidth for a download,'' John C. Liu, the city comptroller, a Democrat who is also expected to run for mayor in 2013, said in a statement, adding that the ''claim of job losses is rhetoric at its worst.''

HEADLINE: Deal Is Struck That Would Fill Waterfront Gap

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

 BODY:
City and state officials on Wednesday agreed to a $73 million plan that would unlock an underutilized chunk of the Manhattan waterfront between East 38th and East 60th Streets, paving the way for a new United Nations office tower and esplanade along the East River. 
The deal would enable the city to plug in the largest remaining gap in the 32-mile Greenway around Manhattan as part of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's effort to revitalize the city's waterfront for commercial, recreation and transportation purposes.
It would also enable the United Nations to begin a land-use review for a long-planned tower that could be no taller than the 505-foot tall Secretariat Building.
There is no guarantee that the United Nations will commit to the deal, since it was not a party to the agreement. But there is every expectation that the United Nations will be supportive, since it has long sought the land just south of its landmark tower -- currently a playground -- where it could build a new tower. Moreover, the United Nations Development Corporation, a city-state public-benefit corporation that handles the United Nations' real estate needs, was deeply involved in the negotiations.
In a news conference at City Hall, Mr. Bloomberg said that the project could allow the United Nations to create jobs. He also said that it was a ''once-in-a-generation opportunity to open a major section of the waterfront, and that's great news for all New Yorkers, but especially those who live on the East Side.''
According to the deal, the development corporation would pay the city $73 million for the parkland. Once a new tower is erected, the United Nations, which has been renting 1 and 2 United Nations Plaza from the city at below-market rates, would move its offices out of those buildings or begin paying market rents. Selling those buildings would provide the balance of the money to finance the esplanade.
Some residents of the area, especially those in Tudor City, have criticized the plan, saying that a new skyscraper, at First Avenue and 41st Street, would wall them off from the East River. But many local officials have argued that the deal could help residents realize their long-held dream of waterfront access.
At the news conference, Assemblyman Brian Kavanagh, who represents the area, said he anticipated that construction could begin in a few years.
''We're not talking about a two-decade time frame here,'' he said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Europe Fights Reckoning

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER

 BODY:
BRUSSELS -- Many around the world are worried that Europe is about to face a Lehman Brothers moment, a big bankruptcy or sudden default that sets off a new phase of panic in Europe and beyond.
But these days the problem for Europe may be that it has not had -- and may not have -- its own Lehman Brothers, at least in the sense that Lehman shocked Americans to take divisive and expensive steps to repair the damage. Instead, it has seen a slow-motion leak of confidence and a steady drain on credibility that has extracted a large and growing toll on stock and bond prices and on the livelihoods of its citizens.
Nearly two years after the euro crisis began with concerns about the solvency of Greece, fears have spread to big banks and large countries like Spain and Italy and squashed the gradual recovery from the 2008 recession. But Europe still has not had the all-hands emergency response the Bush administration and the United States Federal Reserve were forced to undertake after the collapse of Lehman on Sept. 15, 2008, and it is unclear if even the intensified market turmoil now is enough to prompt one. 
An uncontrolled Greek default or a run on a major European bank could still overturn expectations and compel France, Germany and the European Central Bank to act with much greater urgency. But for now, political and financial leaders are buying time, putting out fires one by one, like propping up Dexia Bank, and making vague promises, as European officials did Wednesday, about scheduling new meetings to discuss the recapitalization of European banks.
''Economists are trained to think about eventual outcomes and work backwards, and that's the way financial markets function, too,'' said Charles Wyplosz, an economist at the Graduate Institute in Geneva. ''That's 180 degrees from how politicians function. They ask themselves about tomorrow or next week or maybe the next election and solve problems as they come. So they're always behind the markets.''
Despite the fact that economists and bank analysts now widely expect that Greece will have to default on its debt, no European leader will say so, at least for the record. Instead, the countries in the euro zone are continuing to act as if measures agreed to in July to shore up Greek finances, and that slow-moving European parliaments have yet to fully approve, are sufficient to contain the crisis. One sign that Europe is preparing to address the problem might be a sudden outbreak of candor about the real condition of Greece, or an acknowledgement that leading European banks that hold sovereign debt of Greece and other troubled countries in the region will need hundreds of billions in new capital to ensure their stability.
But European leaders, especially in France and Germany, whose own banks are exposed, are reluctant to broach the inevitable. Why? Because they do not yet have in place a big pool of funds to ensure that an orderly Greek default does not lead markets to assume that the much larger economies of Spain and Italy will soon follow it into insolvency. And partly because they do not have the political will to commit those funds.
Without a trillion-plus-dollar ''bazooka'' in place to shock and awe increasingly skeptical markets and recapitalize banks, Europeans see themselves as having no choice but to temporize, even if that pushes up the cost of an eventual Greek default. And it renders any bad news -- even bad news that has been anticipated and published in advance, like Greece's again missing its deficit reduction targets this week -- enough to send markets into a fresh nose dive.
The incremental approach of European leaders has frustrated their counterparts in the Obama administration and the Federal Reserve, who have repeatedly urged them to commit to a much bolder rescue plan. It has also done little to calm investors, who have already priced in a Greek default and are looking hungrily at Italy. ''The markets need clarity,'' Mr. Wyplosz said. ''They have no reason to believe there's a floor on public debt, so they fret. Once they have a floor, they can calculate their losses. Markets accept losses and can deal with them, but need a backstop.''
Ultimately, only the European Central Bank can intervene with the firepower necessary to set a floor under the price of the region's sovereign debt. But its departing chairman, Jean-Claude Trichet, has ruled out the idea of the bank's acting as the lender of last resort, even if it only guarantees the bond purchases of another fund, the European Financial Stability Facility.
Germany, the Dutch and the Finns, too, are against allowing the bank to make unlimited bond purchases from sovereign states.
The reluctance blocks even obvious moves, like marking down the value of Greek debt to something approaching the market price, which is now only 40 percent of its face value.
There has not yet been a sufficient sense of crisis -- no Lehman Brothers moment -- that overcomes longstanding European qualms about handing a full range of Fed-style powers to the region's central bank.
And residents of richer countries in Europe are not yet unnerved enough to agree to write big checks to Europeans elsewhere whom they accuse of spending themselves into a debt crisis.
''Greece is small and its problems can easily be contained,'' said Sony Kapoor, managing director of Re-Define, an economic consultancy. ''But the inability of officials to deal with this successfully over a year and a half inspires little confidence in their ability to deal with much larger troubled countries such as Italy.''
''The E.C.B. can still stem the panic though a strong intervention,'' he continued. ''But unless this is done soon, the crisis may spin further out of control.'' For now, Europeans leaders are sticking to their talking points.
Many leading economists and bankers now say that major banks in Europe need hefty infusions of capital to weather the inevitable downgrading of the value of European sovereign debt they have on their books. But the banks themselves and their government regulators continue to preach the fiction that the debt is worth more, and in some cases considerably more, than its market value. That only persuades the markets to disregard official statements and continue selling.
The Lehman crisis began when American regulators badly miscalculated, effectively allowing the big investment bank to go bankrupt. But as harmful and unpredictable as that event was at the time, it compelled the Fed to experiment with new forms of intervention in the financial markets and forced a reluctant Democrat-controlled House to approve a huge bailout to shore up the banking system.
Europe's collective decision making is even more fractious. The countries that use the euro are a collection of sovereign states that all must agree on any painful steps, which may even be harder than getting Congress to do the same. Several European parliaments have yet to approve their shares of a 440 billion euro bailout fund that is now all but officially acknowledged to be too small to grapple with the full scale of the problem.
Moreover, there is already fierce opposition in Germany and at the central banks to American notions of how that fund could increase its financial firepower without formally applying to parliaments for more money.
Lehman Brothers provided the United States, for good or ill, a moment of reckoning. Europe is still trying desperately to avoid one.

HEADLINE: Freddie and Fannie Reject Debt Relief

BYLINE: By SHAILA DEWAN

 BODY:
Home values have fallen so much in Arizona that almost half the people with mortgages there owe more than their homes are worth. So when federal money became available to help stem the tide of foreclosures, the state flagged that group for help.
If banks would forgive some of a homeowners' mortgage debt, the state said it would pay half, up to $50,000 of a $100,000 loan reduction. Despite the generous terms, most banks balked.
Only three homeowners have been approved for debt reduction since the program began in September 2010. A major obstacle has been that the two largest mortgage guarantors, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, will not participate -- in Arizona or elsewhere. No loans are eligible for the state's program if they were bought and held or securitized by the two companies, which are now under government control and guarantee more than 70 percent of the country's home loans.
''It is extremely difficult for the principal reduction program to be successful'' when Fannie and Freddie opt out, said Shaun Rieve, a spokesman for the Arizona Department of Housing. 
The companies' policy against debt forgiveness, or principal reduction, has blocked widespread use of what many have come to believe is an indispensable tool for fixing the housing problem. The state attorneys general have been insisting that debt forgiveness be a part of the multibillion-dollar settlement they are negotiating with big banks over faulty mortgage practices.
Smaller investors and companies that service home loans have stepped up debt forgiveness as well.
Not so Edward J. DeMarco, who as acting director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency oversees Fannie and Freddie. Even though he recently signaled that he might make it easier for homeowners to refinance into more favorable loans, he has held his ground on debt relief. Fannie and Freddie say reducing the principal is bad for business, and as a result bad for taxpayers.
Critics counter that banks and investors have benefited from the government response to the housing collapse while borrowers have largely been left to sink. Last week the inspector general of the Federal Housing Finance Agency said that Freddie Mac had not pursued Bank of America aggressively for compensation for bad loans, despite warnings from a senior staff member.
''It's sinful, is the word I would use, that they won't do this,'' said John Taylor, president of the National Community Reinvestment Corporation, referring to debt forgiveness. ''And the only reason they won't is they don't want to realize the red ink that's already on their books.'' They are delaying taking inevitable losses on shaky loans.
White House officials say that although taxpayers essentially own Fannie and Freddie, the administration lacks authority to require Mr. DeMarco to comply with its policies, which encourage principal reduction through a handful of programs. The Federal Housing Administration and the Veterans Administration do not allow principal reduction on their loans either.
Large lenders have long resisted debt forgiveness because of fears that it creates a moral hazard, meaning it could encourage borrowers to take out risky loans in the future because the consequences would not be so bad, or to default to qualify for principal reduction. They argue that other types of loan modifications achieve the same goal.
Proponents of debt forgiveness argue that the failure to reduce debt is hurting the economy, postponing inevitable losses and costing more in the long run. While 28 percent of all loans that are modified go into default again within a year, loan modifications involving principal reduction are more successful. In the latest sign that debt forgiveness might make financial sense to some on the lender side, the nation's second-largest mortgage insurance company, PMI Group, has found a way around Fannie and Freddie's policy. PMI, which shares the credit risk in many Fannie and Freddie loans, will pay some underwater homeowners, those who owe more than their home is worth, if they make prompt payments for several years, a de facto principal reduction.
While the company would not disclose what percentage of the principal was covered, a spokesman for the Loan Value Group, which administers the program for PMI, said that on average it was 5 to 7 percent of the loan amount but could be as much as 30 percent.
Fannie and Freddie's rejection of principal reduction may simply be postponing losses that will occur anyway. Sharon Wells, a retired real estate agent who lives on Social Security, said the modification by Chase Bank of her Fannie Mae mortgage led to an increase in the principal rather than a reduction, even though she already owed about 30 percent more than her home, near Phoenix, was worth.
Ms. Wells, 66, said she had heart trouble and had outlived her doctor's prognosis, so there was virtually no chance that she would live to pay off the new 40-year term, or that the house would regain its previous value before her death, meaning the lenders would ultimately take the loss anyway. She had been preparing to sell her home and downsize when the market crashed.
''The logical, pragmatic thing, the thing that would have helped this country the most, would have been to write this loan down to a realistic number so we could have the normal buying and selling of homes,'' she said.
But Fannie and Freddie maintain that deciding who merits principal reduction raises concerns about fairness. They argue that if future lenders believe there is a chance that borrowers will not have to repay the entire amount, they will price that risk into their loans, raising costs for everyone. The companies say making monthly payments affordable is achieved equally well by forbearance, which allows part of the principal to be subtracted from the calculation of payments and instead tacked on to the end of the mortgage. ''We're not sure what is gained by giving up the right to collect that principal after the forbearance period ends and the borrower has regained financial footing,'' said Brad German, a spokesman for Freddie Mac.
But proponents of debt forgiveness say that forbearance does little to increase a borrower's willingness to pay.
''The banks are trying to shoehorn an affordability fix into a negative equity problem,'' said Frank Pallotta, a managing partner of the Loan Value Group, which runs the homeowner incentive program used by PMI. ''About 35 percent of all defaults are at least in part strategic,'' he said, meaning that even if a financial mishap like job loss is behind a homeowner's decision to stop paying, being underwater is a factor.
About one in five homeowners with a mortgage is underwater, and the total amount of negative equity is estimated at $700 billion to $800 billion. While many of those borrowers are coping with self-inflicted wounds, the problem is not limited to subprime loans.
Among mortgages backed by Fannie and Freddie, a vast majority of which are prime, the percentage of underwater homeowners is virtually the same as the percentage among all mortgages. The scope of the problem has led to calls for an across-the-board write-down, a solution that is expensive, impractical and unnecessary, says Mark Zandi, an economist at Moody's Analytics.
''I don't think the problem is as deep as people think,'' Mr. Zandi said. Just enough principal reduction is needed to shrink the share of foreclosed homes on the market, which would allow prices to rise, he said. Homeowners would be less likely to default if prices were increasing, he added. Servicers providing principal reduction have devised ways to limit moral hazard. In Arizona, the program was restricted to homeowners with moderate incomes who had resisted taking out equity loans in the boom. Ocwen Loan Servicing, whose loan modifications top the national average, intensively evaluates the homeowner's budget before determining if principal reduction would result in a net gain for the investor, who otherwise might face a steeper loss in foreclosure.
After a successful trial program, Ocwen, based in Atlanta, has also begun offering shared appreciation plans, in which part of a borrower's principal is forgiven, but if the home is eventually sold at a profit, the owner must share that profit with the lender.
As for moral hazard, Steve Bailey, chief servicing officer at PennyMac, a California company that bought shaky loans, said that failure to cut principal was to blame, not the other way around.
''A loan that is modified and left at 200 percent loan-to-value invites the moral hazard,'' he said. ''You're telling a person that they need to live in this house that's severely underwater, paying more for housing than they need to, and looking around their neighborhood at homes that have gone through foreclosure and are available for much less.''

HEADLINE: Where's the Jobs Bill? Congressional Democrats need to stop cowering and fight for it

 BODY:
When Eric Cantor, the House Republican leader, predictably said that President Obama's jobs bill was dead on arrival in his chamber, and would not even be debated, the president -- in a break from his usual forbearance -- lashed right back at him. ''Does he not believe in rebuilding America's roads and bridges?'' Mr. Obama asked on Tuesday. Does Mr. Cantor oppose rehiring teachers or construction workers, he continued, or giving tax breaks to businesses that hire?
It was the kind of strong, personal rejoinder to Republican obstructionism that Mr. Obama needs to make. Unfortunately, he has not been as forceful in pressing the other lawmakers holding up his bill: Senate Democrats. 
Nearly a month after the president proposed his jobs bill, it has not yet been taken up in the chamber controlled by his party. ''We'll get to that,'' Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader, said last month, after taking up a misguided bill to punish China for currency manipulation. The truth is that Mr. Reid has not had enough Democratic votes to even claim a Senate majority. That is because so many members of his caucus do not have the political courage to stand up for aggressive government action to revive the economy, or to admit that both higher taxes on the wealthy and an end to corporate tax breaks are necessary to pay for it and to start wrestling down the deficit.
The Republicans have used that cowardice to embarrass Mr. Reid, his party and Mr. Obama. On Tuesday, when the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, prankishly offered to bring up the jobs bill, Mr. Reid was forced to object, leading to all sorts of merry, if hollow, taunts from the Republican side.
The Republicans' willingness to play political games while millions are out of work is inexcusable, but the eagerness of some Democratic senators to protect big business and big contributors is no less frustrating.
Oil state Democrats, like Mark Begich of Alaska and Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, are resisting ending tax breaks for energy conglomerates. Ben Nelson of Nebraska and Bill Nelson of Florida have objected to broad tax revenue increases. Even Charles Schumer of New York objected to increases on families making more than $250,000, claiming-- no more convincingly than Republicans do -- that many are struggling small businesses.
To reassemble his coalition, Mr. Reid on Wednesday proposed scrapping the president's plan to pay for his bill, and substituting a new 5 percent surtax on incomes of more than $1 million. That would increase the progressivity of the tax code, and White House officials said they could accept it. But their original idea was much better.
Ultimately, families making $250,000, and even those making less, will have to give back some of the tax benefits they got from the Bush administration if the budget is to return to long-term health. Beginning that tax-reform process now makes more sense than confining the new tax to millionaires, whatever its populist satisfactions.
In the end, it may be a political exercise anyway, since Mr. McConnell's Republicans will filibuster any jobs bill, and Mr. Cantor's will reject most of it. But the sharp contrast with the Republican plan to do nothing can only be made if Democrats are clearly united behind a plan to invigorate the economy. Mr. Reid insists the millionaire's tax will unite Democrats and produce a vote on the jobs plan in the next few days. It cannot come soon enough.

HEADLINE: A Revenue Bill And a Gauntlet For the G.O.P.

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR; Jennifer Steinhauer contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- In proposing a 5 percent surtax on incomes of more than $1 million a year to pay for job-creation measures sought by President Obama, Senate Democratic leaders on Wednesday escalated efforts to strike a more populist tone and to draw Republicans into a confrontation over how much affluent Americans should pay to help others cope with a struggling economy.
The White House, after dismissing a similar proposal late last year, left the door open to backing the plan. ''We are open to different ways of paying for the very important broadly supported measures in the American Jobs Act that would grow the economy and create jobs,'' said the press secretary, Jay Carney. 
The new plan, devised by the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, has a twofold purpose: to draw a sharp contrast with Congressional Republicans, who have dug in against any increases in tax rates, and to quell a revolt brewing among some Democrats who objected to parts of the White House plan.
Mr. Reid said the surtax would raise $445 billion over 10 years, just about the amount needed to pay for the jobs bill, though it appears unlikely it could make it through Congress.
The proposal, he said, would ''have the richest of the rich pay a little bit more'' -- specifically, ''5 percent more to fund job creation and ensure this country's economic success.''
Mr. Reid's proposal was to have taken effect in 2012. The White House suggested a one-year delay. Mr. Reid agreed. On Wednesday night, his office announced a change, saying: ''The millionaires' surtax will now take effect in 2013, not 2012. The surtax rate is also changed, to 5.6 percent from 5 percent.''
Many economists predict that the economy will still face serious problems, including high unemployment, in 2012, an election year. Mr. Reid made clear that he thought his party would gain a political advantage from the proposal.
''It's interesting to note that independents, Democrats and Republicans and even the Tea Party agree it's time for millionaires and billionaires to pay their fair share of taxes,'' Mr. Reid said Wednesday.
The plan, pushed by Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, the No. 3 Senate Democrat, comes after Mr. Obama earlier proposed a ''Buffett Rule'' that would force wealthy Americans to pay more in taxes. It also comes against a backdrop of protests against Wall Street, giving Democrats hope they can tap into some of that sentiment in next year's elections.
Indeed, the Democratic proposal seems more about politics than policy. Even if wavering Democrats could be rounded up to support the president's plan, Senate Republicans could block the proposal by denying Democrats the votes needed to overcome a near-certain filibuster.
Republicans, who control the House, scorned the new proposal.
In an interview with Bloomberg Television, the House majority leader, Representative Eric Cantor, Republican of Virginia, said: ''Here we go again, continued insistence in Washington -- raise taxes on job creators right now. That's not what we need. Most people in America think it's counterintuitive to raise taxes if you want economic growth.''
Details of the surtax proposal are still being worked out.
Congressional aides said it would probably work this way: The government would collect an additional tax equal to 5.6 percent of the amount of income exceeding $1 million. So for a person with income of $1.1 million, the extra tax would be $5,600, which is 5.6 percent of $100,000. Estimates from the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation indicate that 330,000 households have more than $1 million of income, broadly defined.
The proposed surtax would apply to wages and salaries, capitals gains, interest, dividends and some other types of income, Congressional aides said.
Public opinion polls suggest some support for the Democrats' approach.
In a recent CBS News poll, 64 percent of people said taxes should be increased on households earning $1 million a year or more and 30 percent said the government should address the budget deficit without increasing taxes on those households. Only a quarter said this tax increase would help job creation, 18 percent said it would hurt job creation and about half said it would not make a difference.
Tax rates on the wealthy have declined in recent decades. The total federal tax rate for the top one-thousandth of all earners -- a group that now starts at about $1.5 million in annual income -- was 53.7 percent in 1980, according to research by the economists Emmanuel Saez and Thomas Piketty. By 2004, the latest year for which the economists have data, the total federal rate had fallen to 33.7 percent.
To pay for his jobs plan, Mr. Obama proposed a grab bag of tax increases. Individual Democratic senators objected to some of the proposals, including ones that would have eliminated tax breaks for oil and gas companies, limited the value of itemized deductions for high-income people and required owners of corporate jets to pay higher taxes.
Mr. Schumer said Wednesday that he hoped the new proposal would deflect criticism aimed at the president's proposals.
''Drawing the line at a million dollars is the right thing to do,'' Mr. Schumer said. ''In the eyes of many, it is hard to ask more of households that make $250,000 or $300,000 a year. Many of them are not rich. In large parts of the country, that kind of income does not get you a big home or lots of vacations or anything else that's associated with wealth.''
Representative Doug Lamborn, Republican of Colorado, said he thought the Senate plan would be harmful to employers. ''There are a lot of so-called millionaires who are small businesses,'' Mr. Lamborn said. ''They're not a movie star, they're not a Hollywood actor, they're the dry cleaner on the corner.''
Mr. Schumer said the new proposal spared many small businesses whose income is passed through to their owners and taxed as personal income. If the owners' income is less than $1 million, Democrats said, they would not be affected by the ''millionaires' tax.''
The proposal may help unify Democrats, allowing them to present themselves as populists in a tax fight with Republicans.
Democratic leaders said they believed the new proposal would win support from Democratic senators like Mark Begich of Alaska and Mary L. Landrieu of Louisiana, who have expressed reservations about some of the tax changes in the president's plan.

HEADLINE: All Quiet on the Southern Front

BYLINE: By VERONICA ESCOBAR. 
Veronica Escobar, a Democrat, is the county judge in El Paso.

 BODY:
El Paso
ACCORDING to many of the leading Republican presidential candidates, including my governor, Rick Perry, the border between Texas and Mexico is among the most dangerous in the world. All of them insist that ''securing'' the border has to come before any sort of comprehensive immigration reform, but Mr. Perry has been particularly aggressive about it. ''It is not safe on that border,'' he said recently, and he called President Obama a liar for suggesting otherwise. He's even said he was open to sending American troops into Mexico to counter the violence.
Those of us who actually live along the border know otherwise. El Paso, the largest city along the United States-Mexico border, is also one of the country's safest cities and the heart of a vibrant binational community. 
The region has its problems -- our sister city across the border, Ciudad Juarez, has been ravaged by Mexico's drug war -- but a focus on a quasi-military approach ignores the need for real solutions to our economic and social challenges.
As a lifelong resident of El Paso, I find it disheartening to see our city, and the border region in general, misrepresented for political advantage. Texas border cities are as safe or safer than other cities their size in Texas.
Yet despite the facts, Mr. Perry continues to cast El Paso and our neighbors as poster cities for border violence: last year he claimed, without evidence, that bombs were exploding in our streets and that Juarez was the most dangerous city in America (even though it's in Mexico).
Mr. Perry is far from alone. Many Republican politicians -- and not a few Democrats, too -- use the bogeyman of border violence to justify exorbitant security measures, like the ever-lengthening border fence that costs $2.8 million per mile (for a total of $6.5 billion, including maintenance, over the 20-year lifetime of the fence). Mr. Perry's brainchild, security cameras, have so far cost $4 million to put in place and maintain.
These measures do little besides waste money. Tunnels already run below the border fence. During their first two years in operation, Mr. Perry's cameras led to the arrest of a whopping 26 people -- that's $154,000 per arrest. And once undocumented immigrants are apprehended, costs continue to mount: in this fiscal year alone, the federal government is budgeting $2 billion just for detention.
But there's a bigger cost to my community. Claims about our supposedly dangerous border would be laughable if they didn't damage our image and our ability to recruit talent, investment and events. El Paso is home to an emerging national research university, a new cutting-edge medical school, one of the nation's largest military installations and a vibrant business community.
It is also an important trade corridor, and our busy land ports -- through which $70 billion worth of commerce passed last year -- are critical to the American economy. The factories across the Rio Grande provide products for the American homebuilding and automobile industries, as well as high-tech electronics.
None of that seems to matter, however, when El Paso is made the symbol of our supposedly broken border.
True, there are challenges along the border. We need jobs and investment, as well as improvements to the trade infrastructure on which our economy depends. While billions have been expended for walls, cameras and detention, we've seen little investment in our ports. During an era of shrinking budgets, our nation's resources should be spent more wisely.
In El Paso, for every four Customs and Border Protection agent positions, there are three vacancies. As a result, commerce waits as trucks idle for hours in long lines. Such congestion frustrates business, and it certainly doesn't make us safer or assist our economy.
A recent study commissioned by the Texas Department of Transportation warned that if our ports receive no investment, including additional personnel, El Paso's economy will contract by $54 billion over the next 25 years, driving up unemployment and hurting trade. And what harms our economy harms the state and national economies.
While the one-dimensional security discussion continues, candidates continue to avoid dealing with the complex border reality. It would be in the candidates' and the country's best interest to present the truth about the cities on the border: we are safe, dynamic economic engines that need strategic investment.
So while candidates talk about getting tougher, border cities like mine will continue to talk about becoming smarter. Let's just hope they join our conversation soon.

HEADLINE: Is Israel Its Own Worst Enemy?

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

 BODY:
For decades, Palestinian leaders sometimes seemed to be their own people's worst enemies.
Palestinian radicals antagonized the West, and, when militant leaders turned to hijackings and rockets, they undermined the Palestinian cause around the world. They empowered Israeli settlers and hard-liners, while eviscerating Israeli doves.
These days, the world has been turned upside down. Now it is Israel that is endangered most by its leaders and maximalist stance. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is isolating his country, and, to be blunt, his hard line on settlements seems like a national suicide policy. 
Nothing is more corrosive than Israel's growth of settlements because they erode hope of a peace agreement in the future. Mr. Netanyahu's latest misstep came after the Obama administration humiliated itself by making a full-court diplomatic press to block Palestinian statehood at the United Nations. At a time when President Obama had a few other things on his plate -- averting a global economic meltdown, for example -- the United States frittered good will by threatening to veto the Palestinian statehood that everybody claims to favor.
With that diplomatic fight at the United Nations under way, Israel last week announced plans for 1,100 new housing units in a part of Jerusalem outside its pre-1967 borders. Instead of showing appreciation to President Obama, Mr. Netanyahu thumbed him in the eye.
O.K., I foresee a torrent of angry responses. I realize that many insist that Jerusalem must all belong to Israel in any peace deal anyway, so new settlements there don't count. But, if that's your position, then you can kiss any peace deal goodbye. Every negotiator knows the framework of a peace agreement -- 1967 borders with land swaps, Jerusalem as the capital of both Israeli and Palestinian states, only a token right of return -- and insistence on a completely Israeli Jerusalem simply means no peace agreement ever.
Former President Bill Clinton said squarely in September that Mr. Netanyahu is to blame for the failure of the Middle East peace process. A background factor, Mr. Clinton noted correctly, is the demographic and political change within Israeli society, which has made the country more conservative when it comes to border and land issues.
Granted, Mr. Netanyahu is far from the only obstacle to peace. The Palestinians are divided, with Hamas controlling Gaza. And Hamas not only represses its own people but also managed to devastate the peace movement in Israel. That's the saddest thing about the Middle East: hard-liners like Hamas empower hard-liners like Mr. Netanyahu.
We're facing a dangerous period in the Middle East. Most Palestinians seem to feel as though the Oslo peace process has fizzled, and Israelis seem to agree, with two-thirds saying in a recent poll published in the newspaper Yediot Aharonot that there is no chance of peace with Palestinians -- ever.
The Palestinians' best hope would be a major grass-roots movement of nonviolent peaceful resistance aimed at illegal West Bank settlements, led by women and inspired by the work of Mahatma Gandhi and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. A growing number of Palestinians are taking up variants of that model, although they sometimes ruin it by defining nonviolence to include stone-throwing and by giving the leading role to hotheaded young men.
The Israel Defense Forces can deal with suicide bombers and rockets fired by Hezbollah. I'm not sure that they can defeat Palestinian women blocking roads to illegal settlements and willing to endure tear gas and clubbing -- with videos promptly posted on YouTube.
Mr. Netanyahu has also undermined Israeli security by burning bridges with Israel's most important friend in the region, Turkey. Now there is also the risk of clashes in the Mediterranean between Israeli and Turkish naval vessels. That's one reason Defense Secretary Leon Panetta scolded the Israeli government a few days ago for isolating itself diplomatically.
So where do we go from here? If a peace deal is not forthcoming soon, and if Israel continues its occupation, then Israel should give the vote in Israeli elections to all Palestinians in the areas it controls. If Jews in the West Bank can vote, then Palestinians there should be able to as well.
That's what democracy means: people have the right to vote on the government that controls their lives. Some of my Israeli friends will think I'm unfair and harsh, applying double standards by focusing on Israeli shortcomings while paying less attention to those of other countries in the region. Fair enough: I plead guilty. I apply higher standards to a close American ally like Israel that is a huge recipient of American aid.
Friends don't let friends drive drunk -- or drive a diplomatic course that leaves their nation veering away from any hope of peace. Today, Israel's leaders sometimes seem to be that country's worst enemies, and it's an act of friendship to point that out.

HEADLINE: Bringing Turkish Photography to the World Stage

BYLINE: JAMES ESTRIN


HIGHLIGHT: A centuries-old crossroads for East-West trade now hopes to be the same for photography. Later this month, Turkey's second-largest city will host the first international Bursa Photo Festival. 

 BODY:
For more than six centuries, the bazaars of Bursa, Turkey, have been a meeting point of East and West - between Europe and Asia. The ancient trading routes known as the Silk Road passed through the shops in Bursa, where you can still buy silk, spices and handcrafted gold jewelry.
Fittingly, the bazaar will become a crossroads for photographers from Turkey, Europe, the Middle East and beyond when it hosts the first Bursa Photo Fest from Oct. 15 to Oct. 23. Images by photographers from abroad, including Maggie Steber, Ken Light, Kai Wiedenhoefer, Ken Schles, Carolyn Drake and Randa Mirza, as well as Turkish photographers like Ozan Sagdic and Ergun Cagatay will be seen by foreign visitors - and by tens of thousands of shoppers.
It is a bold attempt to make Turkey a center for international photography.
"If you go to a photo festival in China there are mainly Asians there, and if you go to one in the U.S. or France you see Europeans and Americans," said Utku Kaynar, 32, the festival's coordinator. "Turkey is the natural place for all of the photography world to meet."
He also hopes the festival will present Turkish photography to a global audience. Despite a vibrant national photography scene, few Turks have been recognized for their work outside of the country. At Bursa, visitors will be able to view a variety of photographers and a range of work.
Mr. Cagatay's photographs of Turkic-speaking people from the Balkans to China will be on display, as will Kerem Cobanli's lighted nighttime scenes. Visitors will be walking upon the underwater images by Alptekin Baloglu, which will cover the floor of the shopping district's central corridor.
Mr. Kaynar recruited the American photographer Jason Eskenazito curate the photography exhibits from abroad. Mr. Eskenazi has been traveling to Istanbul for the last two years while working on his project on the East-West divide. At Bursa, he has made women - Rena Effendi, Kate Brooks, Ms. Drake and Xenia Nikolskaya - the foundation of the exhibits. "I wanted to support women as much as possible, because women's roles in the region are sometimes weakened," said Mr. Eskenazi, 52.
Mr. Eskenazi, who published the critically acclaimed book "Wonderland: A Fairy Tale of the Soviet Monolith," has also created a book contest. Photographers can enter a book dummy, and the winner will be published in Turkey.
It is an an auspicious time to start an international photography festival in the region. The upheavals of the Arab Spring continue to reshape the Middle East, and political reform and economic growth have pushed Turkey to an even more prominent role in the world. Mr. Kaynar says that photography has an important role in the promotion of democracy.
"People in Turkey and the Middle East have been kept voiceless," Mr. Kaynar said. "We need to establish a platform where people can express themselves photographically and maybe contribute to making the world a better place."

HEADLINE: Are Children of Illegal Immigrants Entitled to a Public Education?

BYLINE: SUSANNAH L. GRIFFEE


HIGHLIGHT: What is your take on the school-registration provision of Alabama's new immigration law? 

 BODY:
A New York Times editorial, "Alabama's Shame," argues that the Alabama immigration law is cruel and counterproductive:
School superintendents and principals across the state confirm that attendance of Hispanic children has dropped noticeably since the word went out that school officials are now required to check the immigration status of newly enrolled students and their parents.
That rule is part of the law's sweeping attempt to curtail the rights and complicate the lives of people without papers, making them unable to enter contracts, find jobs, rent homes or access government services. In other words, to be isolated, unemployable, poor, defenseless and uneducated.
The education crackdown is particularly senseless and unconstitutional. In 1982, the Supreme Court found that all children living in the United States have the right to a public education, whatever their immigration status. The justices' reasoning was shaped not by compassion but practicality: it does the country no good to perpetuate an uneducated underclass.
Students: Tell us what you think about Alabama's immigration law, including the school registration provision. What are the arguments for and against the provision? Which do you most strongly agree and disagree with? Does the law unfairly keep children from attending school? Or does it ensure that illegal immigrants cannot take advantage of services meant for American citizens?

HEADLINE: The Debate Over Online Learning

BYLINE: REBECCA R. RUIZ


HIGHLIGHT: Two former governors call for the country's public universities to embrace online courses as a way to make going to college easier and to increase revenue. 

 BODY:
In an opinion piece Thursday on the blog Inside Higher Ed, two former governors -- Jeb Bush of Florida and Jim Hunt of North Carolina -- argue that America's public universities must embrace online education.
The authors emphasize that expanding online course offerings at public institutions would expand the supply of seats - the number of students a university might accept - and expand that university's revenue.
But would such an increase in class size - not to mention the challenge of teaching and learning online - demean the quality of instruction?

Mr. Bush, a Republican, and Mr. Hunt, a Democrat, think not. They cite Education Department data from last year reporting that "students who took all or part of a course online performed better, on average, than those taking the same course through traditional face-to-face instruction."
Bill Keller, the Times's former executive editor and now a columnist, took up this subject in a piece this week, expressing a bit more skepticism of college learning on the Web. As Mr. Keller wrote:
"Our top-rated universities and colleges have no want of customers willing to pay handsomely for the kind of education their parents got; thus elite schools have little incentive to dilute the value of the credentials they award."
And yet, he continued, universities like Stanford are increasingly experimenting with course lectures on the Web, some open to all Internet users, free of charge.
Mr. Keller concluded on a note of caution: "Who could be against an experiment that promises the treasure of education to a vast, underserved world? But we should be careful, in our idealism, not to diminish something that is already a wonder of the world," referring to the traditional on-campus college experience.
Meanwhile, Mr. Bush and Mr. Hunt are crying "full speed ahead," urging public colleges to stream lectures and digitize learning in response to a student population that "live lives that are divorced from the static, brick-and-mortar reality of institutions built for 19th century economic circumstances."

HEADLINE: Young Doctors Worry About Career Choices

BYLINE: BRUCE JAPSEN


HIGHLIGHT: Education debts, changes under the health care law and the economy contribute to anxieties among new physicians. 

 BODY:
Even though young doctors still receive a lot of job offers in one of the worst markets in decades, nearly one-third would select another profession if they had to decide on a career all over again, according to a new study out Thursday.
The study by the large physician staffing company Merritt Hawkins comes just as the job market for doctors would appear ripe for a spike in salaries. A physician shortage looms at the same time that there may be more than 30 million paying customers coming in their doors once federal health care legislation brings broader coverage for uninsured Americans in 2014.
"Even in a stagnant economy, new doctors are being recruited like blue chip athletes," said James Merritt, founder of Merritt Hawkins.
To be sure, 78 percent of doctors polled in their final year of training said they had at least 50 solicitations from people wanting to offer them a job, Merritt Hawkins said. And nearly half, or 47 percent, said they had 100 or more solicitations. More than 300 doctors were queried in their final year of training, Merritt Hawkins said.
But a growing number of these hot employment prospects still regret their choice of profession, citing large medical education debts, the changing economics of health care, and the health care law and how it might affect their future practices and profession.
"With declining reimbursement, increasing costs, malpractice worries and the uncertainty of health reform, the medical profession is under duress today," Mr. Merritt said. "Many newly minted doctors are concerned about what awaits them." 
Dr. Steven Stack, the chairman-elect of the American Medical Association, a 39-year-old emergency physician from Lexington, Ky., said young physicians were "grappling with our broken medical liability system, large medical student debts, threats of Medicare and Medicaid payment cuts, burdensome regulations and insurance company hassles."
For example, Dr. Katherine Imborek, 31, just finished her family practice residence in August at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics and started Monday in her first job as a full-fledged doctor at a university-run clinic in Iowa City. She said her colleagues worried about large debts and the inability to spend time with their patients.
"I feel like I am going to make a good living, and it is going to take a long time to pay off your loans, but I feel like what I am doing now is what I am supposed to do with my life and I find the field of medicine rewarding," said Dr. Imborek, who said her annual salary would be about $150,000 a year.
But she said her colleagues were worried about seeing an influx of patients once the health care law goes into full effect. 
"We need to figure something out before it reaches a tipping point," Dr. Imborek said. "There are too many patients to be seen and not a lot of doctors to take care of them."
Still, doctors are being financially rewarded as they move into the future.
A Merritt Hawkins survey of recruitment incentives released in June showed average salaries rising sharply for primary care physicians - family doctors, internists and pediatricians - because demand for physicians in these fields is strong.
In that survey, a family practice physician, on average, was offered a base salary or income guarantee in the 2010/2011 recruitment period of $178,000, up about 2 percent from $175,000 in the 2009/2010 recruitment period. Meanwhile, an internal medicine doctor was offered on average $205,000, up 7 percent from $191,000 in 2009/2010.
The figures in the survey include only base salaries or income guarantees and do not include production bonuses or benefits, Merritt Hawkins said.
Specialties also showed big gains, Merritt Hawkins said. Urology had the biggest jump, with an increase of 13 percent to $453,000 in 2010/11 from $400,000 in 2009/2011. Close behind in increase was invasive cardiology, which saw a 7 percent increase to $532,000 in 2010/11 from $495,000 in 2009/2010, according to the June recruitment incentive survey.

HEADLINE: Need to Save Money? Move In With Relatives

BYLINE: ANN CARRNS


HIGHLIGHT: More people moved in with relatives to save money during the recession. 

 BODY:
Here's a way to save money: Move in with relatives.
Lots of Americans have done just that during the economic downturn, an analysis of census data from the Pew Research Center finds.
In fact, the trend helped touch off the largest increase in the number of Americans living in multigenerational households in modern history, the report says. From 2007 to 2009, the total spiked to 51.4 million, from 46.5 million. Such households might include a couple and their parents or in-laws, adult children, younger children and grandchildren.
The unemployed, whose numbers are growing, are much more likely to live in multigenerational households - 25.4 percent did in 2009, compared with 15.7 percent of those with jobs.
Living in mixed-generation households appears to be keeping many out of poverty. Although their adjusted incomes over all are lower, Pew found, the poverty rate among people in multigenerational households is substantially smaller than the rate for those in other households - 11.5 percent in the mixed-generation households in 2009 versus 14.6 percent in other types of households.
Plus, the potential benefits of such living arrangements are the greatest for groups that have been most affected by the recession. Among the unemployed, the poverty rate in 2009 was 17.5 percent for those living in multigenerational households, compared with 30.3 percent for those living in other households.
Members of other economically vulnerable groups - young adults, Hispanics and blacks - who live in multigenerational households also experience sharply lower poverty rates than those in other households.
Have you ever lived with relatives? Did it help you save money?

HIGHLIGHT: Ford waves goodbye to 6-cylinder engines for its Escape compact S.U.V. 

 BODY:
In which we bring you motoring news from around the Web:
 Ford announced this week that a V-6 engine would not be offered on its redesigned Escape compact S.U.V., which is scheduled to have its debut at the Los Angeles auto show in November. The Escape will be available with three 4-cylinder power plants: a 1.6-liter EcoBoost that the automaker expects to deliver better highway fuel economy than the current Escape Hybrid, which is rated at 31 miles per gallon; a 2-liter EcoBoost; and a 2.5-liter Ti-VTC. Output levels for the Escape engines were not revealed. (Ford)
 The Louisiana Superdome, the home of the New Orleans Saints that functioned as an ad-hoc shelter for thousands of city residents during Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath, is now the Mercedes-Benz Superdome. The automaker secured exclusive naming rights at the covered stadium for 10 years at an undisclosed cost. The deal also is the first of its kind for Mercedes-Benz in the United States. (The New York Times)
 Silver is no longer the most popular exterior color among car buyers in North America. White, which reigned for many years before silver's surge, registered as the most popular color in a study by PPG Industries, a manufacturer of automotive paint based in Troy, Mich. The company based its findings on purchase histories of 2011 model-year vehicles. Globally, white also displaced silver. (The Detroit Free Press)
 Mazda 3 sedans fitted with the Japanese automaker's Skyactiv suite of efficiency-boosting features will be priced from $18,450, and the hatchback from $18,950, excluding an undisclosed delivery charge. The 3, which accounts for more than 40 percent of Mazda's sales in North America, received a light redesign of its front fascia for 2012 and is still available with the base 2-liter, 148-horsepower engine. The Skyactiv-G model produces 155 horsepower while delivering an E.P.A.-certified 40 miles per gallon in highway driving. (Mazda)

HEADLINE: A Recession in Our Minds

BYLINE: JOSHUA BRUSTEIN


HIGHLIGHT: The economy is growing slowly, but measures of Americans' attitudes are at recession levels. Can the economy grow while we are so gloomy? 

 BODY:
Are we in a recession in our minds? 
Americans certainly seem unhappy about the prospects for the economy. Consumer sentiment remains near its lowest levels since 2009. And those daily indicators of investor confidence -- the markets -- have painted a very pessimistic picture; the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, seen as a broad indicator of the market, is down 8 percent for the year.
But economic data based on what people are actually doing tells a slightly different story. There is no measure by which the economy seems robust, but economic indicators published recently -- measuring activity in manufacturing and service, vehicle sales and construction spending -- were relatively positive, beating analysts' expectations. By most measures, the economy is growing, while measures of the national mood are at recession levels. 
This disconnect is illustrated starkly in an analysis by Jeffrey Kleintop, chief market strategist for LPL Financial. Mr. Kleintop compared the University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index, which surveys people about their outlook on the economy, and the Conference Board's Leading Economic Index, which looks primarily at hard economic indicators like how many hours people are working and what manufacturers are ordering. The gap between these two indexes is at a record high, a mirror image of the late 1990s, when optimism about Silicon Valley inflated the tech bubble. 
So why do people feel the economy is doing so much worse than it is? In part, say some economists, it is because of increased cynicism about the ability of the president and Congress to handle the economy. Indeed, the University of Michigan's consumer confidence index shows a sharp drop this summer during the debt crisis debate. While it has improved slightly since then, it still remains at its lowest levels since early 2009. Economists say that the lack of confidence is also driven by structural changes to the American economy: unemployment has remained high even as the economy has grown slowly, while wages have stagnated for those who are working. 
On Friday, the Labor Department will release its monthly report on jobs, which has a particularly visceral impact on ordinary Americans. Last month, the report showed zero job growth nationwide. 
"There's a lot of economic indicators like industrial production, or durable goods orders, that economists put a lot of weight on. Individuals just have no idea what they mean," Mr. Kleintop said. "When you talk about a change in jobs they get that, they understand what it means. It's very intuitive. And they take that information and they extrapolate that to everything." 
Another bad report on job growth on Friday will make it hard for consumers and businesses to gain the confidence they need to spend money, analysts say. 
There is some evidence that people are capable of saying one thing and doing something else. For instance, even in these times of gloom, sales of many items that could be considered indulgences are rising. On Thursday, Nordstrom and Saks Fifth Avenue said their monthly same-store sales were helped by sales of luxury items. But some experts say they believe that a negative outlook on the economy is ultimately a self-fulfilling prophecy. 
"If you talk about recession enough, you can have a recession," said Andrew Goldberg, a strategist with J.P. Morgan Chase Asset Management. 
The stock market can also be pushed downward by a collective lack of confidence, and many analysts describe the market's behavior in recent weeks as "emotional," rather than a rational response to the news investors were getting about the economy. The negativity of investors is largely being driven by events in Europe, where policy makers' lack of decisive action to help Greece confront its debt problems has led to acute fears of a widespread financial crisis. 
Attitudes on Wall Street eventually filter back to those on Main Street. According to an analysis by JPMorgan Chase, a 10 percent year-over-year decrease in the S.&P. 500 amounts to a decline of 2.7 percent in the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index.
A bad stock market is particularly worrisome because it affects the attitudes of those who have the most money to spend, Mr. Goldberg said. He noted that households whose incomes are in the top 20 percent of the country own about 80 percent of the shares traded on American markets. They also make up about 60 percent of consumer spending, a major driver in the economy. So if this group feels poorer, it has a disproportionate impact, potentially dragging down the population as a whole.

HEADLINE: House Votes to Delay Emissions Rule

BYLINE: JOHN M. BRODER


HIGHLIGHT: After passing a bill that would block regulations on cement plants, House Republicans immediately turn to a companion measure stymie rules on toxic emissions from industrial boilers and incinerators. 

 BODY:
 Continuing their largely symbolic attacks on the Environmental Protection Agency's rulemaking authority, House Republicans pushed through a bill on Thursday to block the agency's proposed effort to reduce airborne emissions of dangerous chemicals from cement manufacturing plants.
 The House passed the measure by a vote of 262-161, with 25 Democrats and all but two Republicans voting in support.
 The bill, affecting roughly 100 cement plants in the United States, is the latest, but not the last, of Republican efforts to stymie what they characterize as a wave of E.P.A. regulations that they say is choking the economy and hurting job creation. After passing the cement bill, they immediately turned to a companion measure to block a proposed E.P.A. rule on toxic emissions from industrial boilers and incinerators. Both bills would delay the new rules for at least five years.
 The bills, like several others before them, are unlikely to come up for a vote in the Democratic-controlled Senate, let alone reach the president's desk. And if they do, the White House has promised a veto.

 The cement bill's chief sponsor, Representative John Sullivan, Republican of Oklahoma, said that the proposed regulation could impose untenable costs on the nation's cement producers and make it more expensive to build roads, bridges and buildings.
 "The E.P.A. has gone rogue," he said on Wednesday in a floor speech in support of his legislation, "wanting to shut down 20 percent of cement plants. President Obama, when he came to the joint session here recently, said he wanted to build roads and bridges and infrastructure. Well, I guess he wants to do that with imported Chinese cement, not American-made cement."
 The White House, in its veto message, said that the two Republican bills being considered by the House would have significant public health impacts, including tens of thousands of premature deaths and more than 100,000 asthma attacks. "As a result," the White House said, "even the minimum delay due to these bills could mean forgoing over $100 billion in health benefits. Each additional year of delay would mean forgoing tens of billions of dollars more in net benefits."

HEADLINE: Occupy Anytown, U.S.A.

BYLINE: J. DAVID GOODMAN


HIGHLIGHT: While the number of protesters remains small in many cities, organizers have been quick to establish social-media hubs for each. Here is a collection of some of the most active. 

 BODY:
As unions tentatively throw their support behind the Occupy Wall Street protests in New York, new cities are beginning to set up their own versions.
In Washington, many gathered in McPherson Square on Thursday, two blocks north of the White House, some constructing cardboard boxes with the intention of staying, according to the local blog DCist and images posted on Twitter by Josh Mend, who describes himself as a federal attorney:
View "New story" on Storify
Small protests under the same banner also began officially on Thursday in Dallas; Portland, Ore.; and Philadelphia, where participants have yet to spend the night, according to a blog at Philadelphia Weekly, but they are soliciting donations to create safe zones for sleeping around City Hall. (The blog observes that one logistical hurdle is setting up camp downtown without disturbing "the homeless people who normally sleep at the plaza on the west side of City Hall.")

As The Times reported on Monday, the loose-knit campaign has spread from Zuccotti Park in downtown Manhattan to cities around the country, creating a political dilemma for President Obama.
There are so many nascent gatherings of dozens to hundreds of people adopting the "occupy" label that many on Twitter - where some of the organizing is concentrated and much of the information is disseminated - have taken to spoofing the movement's many hashtags. This Lede blogger's personal favorite is #Occupy21JumpStreet, though the most popular has been #OccupySesameStreet. The left-leaning Mother Jones magazine does a good round-up of joking posts using the latter tag. 
While the numbers remain small in many cities, organizers have been quick to establish social-media hubs for each, laying claim to .org Web sites, Twitter handles and hashtags, Facebook pages, live streams and YouTube channels. 
OccupyTogether.org, a content hub and an apparent model for the design and content of the movement's Web portals, counted 734 protests and/or protest-related meetups around the country on Thursday afternoon, with many scheduled to begin at the end of this week. The size or continuous nature of each could not be independently verified. The site has also pulled together video from around the country into one YouTube channel under the banner of OccupyTV. 
Below are links to some of those in individual cities that appear to be currently most active:

Apart from in-person protests, hundreds of people have uploaded photos with hand-made signs describing their economic distress or political grievances to a fast-growing Tumblr account called We Are the 99 Percent. The phrase, a slogan that has united the disparate interests and goals of the protesters, is meant to draw a contrast to the richest 1 percent of Americans. The Washington Post calculated that this sliver of the population includes those who made a minimum of $516,633 in 2010, with an average total wealth of roughly $14 million in 2009.
The 99 Percent slogan has been often repeated by many protesters, turned into song by a few in Austin, Tex., and has even precipitated a sardonic backlash in Chicago, where someone put handmade signs in the windows of the Chicago Board of Trade, the site of protests, declaring: "We Are the 1%."

HEADLINE: In Bank of England Decision, a Once Lonely Voice Is Heard Loud and Clear

BYLINE: LANDON THOMAS JR.


HIGHLIGHT: The Bank of England's surprise decision to inject 75 billion into the stagnant British economy, is a vindication for Adam Posen. 

 BODY:
Pretty soon they might even call it Posenomics.
The Bank of England's surprise decision on Thursday to inject 75 billion into the stagnant British economy by purchasing government bonds is a vindication for Adam Posen, the American-born economist who sits on the bank's monetary policy committee.
 For months now, the irrepressible Mr. Posen has waged his campaign in private as well as in public, arguing that central banks around the world are running the risk of letting the world economy sink into a second recession by not, in effect, printing more money. 
Here in Britain, where the economy grew at just 0.1 percent in the second quarter, Mr. Posen's call to monetary arms has been supported by a deficit-bound government with little scope to spend money. And the media here have fallen in line, too, with Martin Wolf, the influential columnist for The Financial Times, and The Economist also backing him.
But until now, his peers at the old lady of Threadneedle Street, as the bank is commonly known, begged to differ - much to Mr. Posen's frustration. 
But weak bank lending, a consumer squeeze and broad eurozone malaise seem to have convinced Mr. Posen's colleagues that the economy now needs an extra push, although some still worry that more quantitative easing will only push inflation, already high at 4.5 percent, even higher.
True to the bank's conservative nature, there will be no buying of corporate bonds or other securities - just British bonds, or gilts.
Still, it is very much unclear if Mr. Posen's ultimate goal - coordinated money printing by central banks everywhere - will be achieved.
The European Central Bank voted Thursday to keep rates steady at 1.5 percent and in the United States the Federal Reserve's ability to commence yet another round of unorthodox easing seems constrained by domestic politics.
But as Mr. Posen sees it, the battle has just begun - expect to hear more from him in the future.

HEADLINE: 30-Year Mortgage Rates Fall Below 4%

BYLINE: ANN CARRNS


HIGHLIGHT: Average rates for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages fell below 4 percent for the first time on record. 

 BODY:
The average rate for a conventional, 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell below 4 percent for the first time on record, according to Freddie Mac's weekly market survey that came out on Thursday.
While that is good news for anyone who wants to buy a house or refinance an existing mortgage, Freddie Mac's chief economist, Frank Nothaft, noted in a prepared statement that the decline reflected worries about the global economy.
The 15-year fixed rate also fell to "the lowest level on record" for the sixth consecutive week, the survey found.
Mortgage rates have tracked a slide in 10-year Treasury yields, amid concern that Europe's debt crisis is worsening and the United States economy may slide back into a recession.
Freddie Mac reported that 30-year fixed-rate home loans averaged 3.94 percent, with an average of 0.8 points, for the week ending Oct. 6. That's down from last week's average of 4.01 percent. Last year at this time, the average was 4.27 percent. (Points are essentially interest paid up front, in a lump sum.)
Meanwhile, the average 15-year fixed-rate mortgage was 3.26 percent, with an average of 0.8 points. Last week, it was 3.28 percent, and a year ago, it averaged 3.72 percent.
An exception to the drop in home loan rates was for one-year adjustable rate mortgages, or ARMS. Those rates inched up, to 2.95 percent with an average of .05 points, as the Fed began replacing $400 billion of its short-term Treasury securities, which serve as benchmarks for many ARMs, Mr. Nothaft said.
The question now is whether many Americans, struggling with stubbornly high unemployment, depressed home prices and tougher borrowing requirements, can take advantage of the lower rates to buy a home, or refinance.
Will the lower rates spur you to refinance -- or buy a house?

HEADLINE: Steve Jobs: Imitated, Never Duplicated

BYLINE: DAVID POGUE


HIGHLIGHT: Why Apple's leader was a singular talent. 

 BODY:
Wednesday evening, Apple broke the news that Steve Jobs had died. 
Since that moment, tributes, eulogies and retrospectives have poured over the world like rain. He changed industries, redefined business models, fused technology and art. People are comparing him to Thomas Edison, Walt Disney, Leonardo da Vinci. And they're saying that it will be a very long time before the world sees the likes of Steve Jobs again.
Probably true. But why not, do you suppose?
After all, there are other brilliant marketers, designers and business executives. They're all over Silicon Valley - all over the world. Many of them, maybe most of them, have studied Steve Jobs, tried to absorb his methods and his philosophy. Surely if they pore over the Steve Jobs playbook long enough, they can re-create some of his success. 
But nobody ever does, even when they copy Mr. Jobs's moves down to the last eyebrow twitch. Why not? 
Here's a guy who never finished college, never went to business school, never worked for anyone else a day in his adult life. So how did he become the visionary who changed every business he touched? Actually, he's given us clues all along. Remember the "Think Different" ad campaign he introduced upon his return to Apple in 1997?
"Here's to the crazy ones. The rebels. The troublemakers. The ones who see things differently. While some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius."
In other words, the story of Steve Jobs boils down to this: Don't go with the flow.
Steve Jobs refused to go with the flow. If he saw something that could be made better, smarter or more beautiful, nothing else mattered. Not internal politics, not economic convention, not social graces.

Apple has attained its current astonishing levels of influence and success because it's nimble. It's incredibly focused. It's had stunningly few flops. 
And that's because Mr. Jobs didn't buy into focus groups, groupthink or decision by committee. At its core, Apple existed to execute the visions in his brain. He oversaw every button, every corner, every chime. He lost sleep over the fonts in the menus, the cardboard of the packaging, the color of the power cord.
That's just not how things are done.
Often, his laser focus flew in the face of screamingly obvious common sense. He wanted to open a chain of retail stores - after the failure of Gateway's chain had clearly demonstrated that the concept was doomed. 
He wanted to sell a smartphone that had no keyboard, when physical keys were precisely had made the BlackBerry the most popular smartphone at the time. 
Over and over again, he took away our comfy blankets. He took away our floppy drives, our dial-up modems, our camcorder jacks, our non-glossy screens, our Flash, our DVD drives, our removable laptop batteries. 
How could he do that? You're supposed to add features, not take them away, Steve! That's just not done!
(Often, I was one of the bellyachers. And often, I'd hear from Mr. Jobs. He'd call me at home, or when I was out to dinner, or when I was vacationing with my family. And he'd berate me for not seeing his bigger picture. On the other hand, sometimes he'd call to praise me for appreciating what he was going for. A C.E.O. calling a reviewer at home? That's just not done.)
Eventually, of course, most people realized that he was just doing that Steve Jobs thing again: being ahead of his time. 
Eventually, in fact, society adopted a cycle of reaction to Apple that became so predictable, it could have been a "Saturday Night Live" skit. 
Phase 1: Steve Jobs takes the stage to introduce a new product.
Phase 2: The tech bloggers savage it. ("The iPad has no mouse, no keyboard, no GPS, no USB, no card slot, no camera, no Flash!? It's dead on arrival!")
Phase 3: The product comes out, the public goes nuts for it, the naysayers seem to disappear into the earth.
Phase 4: The rest of the industry leaps into high gear trying to do just what Apple did. 
And so yes, there are other geniuses. There are other brilliant marketers, designers and business executives. Maybe, once or twice in a million, those skills even coincide in the same person.
But will that person also have the vision? The name "Steve Jobs" may appear on 300 patents, but his gift wasn't invention. It was seeing the promise in some early, clunky technology - and polishing it, refining it and simplifying it until it becomes a standard component. Like the mouse, menus, windows, the CD-ROM or Wi-Fi.
Even at Apple, is there anyone with the imagination to pluck brilliant, previously unthinkable visions out of the air - and the conviction to see them through with monomaniacal attention to detail? 
Suppose there were. Suppose, by some miracle, that some kid in a garage somewhere at this moment possesses the marketing, invention, business and design skills of a Steve Jobs. What are the odds that that same person will be comfortable enough - or maybe uncomfortable enough - to swim upstream, against the currents of social, economic and technological norms, all in pursuit of an unshakable vision?
Zero. The odds are zero.
Mr. Jobs is gone. Everyone who knew him feels that sorrow. But the ripples of that loss will widen in the days, weeks and years to come: to the people in the industries he changed. To his hundreds of millions of customers. And to the billions of people touched more indirectly by the greater changes that Steve Jobs brought about, even if they're unaware of it.
In 2005, Steve Jobs gave the commencement address to the graduating students at Stanford. He told them the secret that defined him in every action, every decision, every creation of his tragically unfinished life:
"Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma - which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary."

HEADLINE: The Early Word: The Populist Chord

BYLINE: EMMARIE HUETTEMAN


HIGHLIGHT: With a surtax proposal, Senate Democrats invite Republicans to a showdown over how much the wealthy should pay in a struggling economy. 

 BODY:
Today's Times:

        
Senate Democrats struck a populist chord on Wednesday by proposing a 5 percent surtax on incomes exceeding $1 million annually to cover the cost of President Obama's job creation proposals, baiting Republicans to address how much affluent Americans should pay when others are struggling, Robert Pear reports.
        
Now that Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey has passed on running for president and Gov. Rick Perry of Texas is fighting plummeting poll numbers, this could be Herman Cain's chance. But he seems more focused on selling his new book than campaigning for the Republican nomination, Susan Saulny reports.

HEADLINE: What Steve Jobs Understood That Our Politicians Don't

BYLINE: MATT BAI


HIGHLIGHT: It's staggering to contemplate how much the Apple co-founder understood about modern America that those who govern it still don't. 

 BODY:
As in most other big American cities, it would be hard to walk 100 feet in Washington and not slam into somebody who's using something that Apple created - an iPhone or an iPad or a Macbook Pro. And so it's staggering to contemplate just how little of Steve Jobs's genius ever permeated the nation's politics, and how much he understood about modern America that those who govern it still don't.
After all, if you wanted to really get a picture of how the national culture has evolved in the last few decades, particularly in the urban areas that drive economic growth, you could do a lot worse than to study Apple's string of innovations. Mr. Jobs understood, intuitively, that Americans were breaking away from the last era's large institutions and centralized decision-making, that technology would free them from traditional workplaces and the limits of a physical marketplace. 
This was the underlying point of "think different" - that our choices were no longer dictated by the whims of huge companies or the offerings at the local mall. This was the point of a computer that enabled you to customize virtually every setting, no matter how inconsequential, so that no two users had the exact same experience. This was the essential insight behind devices driven by a universe of new apps, downloaded in seconds depending on your lifestyle and interests.
At the same time, while Mr. Jobs saw a society moving inexorably toward individual choice, he also seemed to understand that such individuality breeds detachment and confusion. And so Apple sought to fill that vacuum by making itself into more than a manufacturer; it became a kind of community, too, with storefronts and stickers and a membership that enabled you to get your e-mail, or video-conference with your friends, or post a Web page of your vacation photos. 
In his obituary of Mr. Jobs on The Times's Web site, John Markoff quoted him as explaining his aversion to market research this way: "It's not the consumers' job to know what they want." In other words, while Mr. Jobs tried to understand the problems that technology could solve for his buyer, he wasn't going to rely on the buyer to demand specific solutions, just so he could avoid ever having to take a risk. This is what's commonly known as leading.
If Mr. Jobs and Apple grappled successfully with the complexities of modern life, however, then American politics, across the ideological spectrum, mostly wished them away. In our political debate, there is no compatibility between the notions of customization and community, the twin pillars of the digital age. It's always one or the other.
Either we're being told that centralized, 20th century systems can never be changed to accommodate more individual flexibility (like say, decoupling health care from employment), or we're being told that all federal programs are wasteful and that everyone American should basically fend for himself. Either we're supposed to rely entirely on large institutions, or we're supposed to rely only on ourselves.
And no politician wants to really innovate without focus groups, to make a sustained argument for any solution that might entail risk or imagination. Our parties are less like Apple and more like General Motors, churning out this year's streamlined model of the same cars they were asking you to buy 20 years ago. Even the circuitry of the democracy remains essentially unchanged; a nation of voters who can find their cars and pay their mortgages online still can't envision the day when they can cast their votes from an iPad. 
This cultural gulf, between Mr. Jobs's America and the one our political leaders inhabit, is largely generational, and it goes long way toward explaining the enthusiasm among younger voters for Mr. Obama's 2008 campaign. Mr. Obama's campaign, conceived outside the party establishment and built on a platform of online membership, felt like a high-tech reimagining of politics. It seemed to presage an age of government that could champion both individuality community, a government that made programs more responsive and flexible without eroding our sense of shared responsibility.
It's safe to say that Mr. Obama no longer inspires much of that, at least partly because whatever more futuristic governing vision he might have had ran smack into economic realities and into the orthodoxies of both parties' aging establishments. Three years later, he's sounding a lot more like a conventional Democrat running for re-election and much less like a political innovator.
But generations will, inevitably, turn over, and Americans who grew up using Steve Jobs's gizmos and apps will ultimately inherit a governing culture that feels dated and stifling. Perhaps then Mr. Jobs's contributions to the American culture will at last reach the city were his Apple logo has become so visible, inspiring a government to try to think a little bit different, too.

HEADLINE: Romney Calls for More Defense Spending

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney tells a group of veterans that given the global threats to America's interests, the nation's defense spending should be increased instead of cut. 

 BODY:
MT. PLEASANT, S.C. -- Standing among retired airplanes on the U.S.S. Yorktown, a decommissioned World War II aircraft carrier, Mitt Romney told a small group of veterans on Thursday that given the global threats to America's interests, the nation's defense spending should be increased instead of cut. 
Acknowledging that waste and excess spending exist within the Defense Department, Mr. Romney still called for increasing the Pentagon's budget.
"Over the last few years we've had a defense budget, excluding the cost of warfare, at about 3.8 percent of the economy, about 3.8 percent of the G.D.P.," he said. "I'd like that be a little higher, at about 4 percent." 
The campaign appearance came a day before Mr. Romney is scheduled to deliver a foreign policy speech at The Citadel, the military college in South Carolina.
Walking the audience through a changing world dynamic - he mentioned an Iran that is seeking a nuclear weapon to "blackmail the world," a North Korea "rattling its nuclear saber," a rising China and the growing threat of jihadists - Mr. Romney talked Thursday about the need for a strong military.
"And so with all those changes, you would think the president and the people in Washington would recognize the importance of the United States military, and the need not to shrink our military, but to strengthen it," he said. "And yet the president and Congress have recently put in place a process whereby we might see the military budget shrink by hundreds of billions of dollars."
Mr. Romney added: "My view is we cannot and should not shrink the scale of the United States Department of Defense budget."
The process Mr. Romney was referring to starts with the joint committee on deficit reduction created under this summer's debt ceiling agreement. If Congress cannot agree on the committee's recommendations, the Defense Department will be forced to find about $900 billion in savings over the coming decade. 
Mr. Romney also said that he would use the military budget to help care for veterans.
"I want to make sure that we treat our veterans in the way our veterans deserve to be treated, not just those in the past, but those in the present that are coming back and suffering from various serious wounds, crippling and disabling injury, as well as both physical and mental conditions," Mr. Romney said. "I don't believe that we can economize on securing our nation and protecting our citizens and assuring that the world remains safe and free for us, for our children, and for theirs. And I will protect the United States of America by protecting a strong military."

HEADLINE: Dubow Steps Down at Gannett, Is Replaced by Martore

BYLINE: TANZINA VEGA


HIGHLIGHT: Craig Dubow is leaving the struggling publisher of USA Today after 30 years because of chronic health problems. 

 BODY:
5:03 p.m. | Updated Craig A. Dubow, the chairman and chief executive of the Gannett Company, who had been on medical leave, resigned on Thursday for health reasons, the company said. Gracia C. Martore, the company's president and chief operating officer, was named president and chief executive by the Gannett board.
Ms. Martore, who will also have a seat on the company's board, served as principal executive officer during Mr. Dubow's leave. Gannett, the country's largest newspaper publisher by circulation, also announced the appointment of Marjorie Magner as nonexecutive chairman. Ms. Magner, who was the chairwoman of Gannett's audit committee, is also a managing partner at the private equity firm.
Gannett, like many other newspaper companies, has struggled in recent years as declines in advertising, especially for classified listings, have become commonplace. The company's shares have dropped about 16 percent in the last year, but were essentially flat on Thursday, at $10.45.
"All of us have had to live through an economy over the last few years, especially 2008 and 2009, that has been the most difficult and challenging economy in the last 80 years," Ms. Martore said. "The great thing about the Gannett Company is that we have 100-plus great brands in local communities that we serve day in and day out."

Ms. Martore said the company would continue to focus on its digital strategy, which she said accounted for 21 percent of the company's total revenue. "We're going to be on every platform that the consumer wants to access that information on," she said.
Ms. Martore cited the company's effort to start a daily deal site, called DealChicken.com, as an example of the types of new digital initiatives that could attract local users and advertisers.
"We already have great relationships with advertisers and marketers in those communities that may want to use those services," she said.
In June, citing weak advertising revenue, the company announced that it would eliminate 700 jobs in its Community Publishing division, laying off 3 percent of its employees working at newspapers like The Courier-Journal of Louisville, The Cincinnati Enquirer and The Indianapolis Star.
In 2010, the company's flagship newspaper, USA Today, also had about 35 layoffs in its newsroom because of weak advertising revenue.
Ms Martore would not comment on whether Gannett would be forced to lay off more workers in the near future, adding that it was still "a little too early to handicap where the economy will be for 2012."
In a statement, Mr. Dubow said: "I am extremely proud of where we are today as a company. We have always maintained an unwavering focus on the consumer. As a result, we have evolved into a digitally led media and marketing solutions company committed to delivering trusted news and information anywhere, anytime."
Mr. Dubow, who had been with Gannett for 30 years, added that he believed "the company's best days lie ahead."
An article on Friday about the resignation of the chairman and chief executive of the Gannett Company misstated the number of employee layoffs in the newsroom of USA Today. About 35 newsroom positions were eliminated in 2010 - not 130, which was the approximate number of total layoffs at the newspaper last year.

HEADLINE: Mortgage Rates at Historic Low

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage fell to 3.94 percent in the United States this week, the lowest rate on record, the mortgage agency Freddie Mac reported Thursday. 
Freddie Mac says the average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage dropped from 4.01 percent last week, the previous low. The average rate on a 15-year fixed-rate loan dipped to 3.26 percent, also a record.
For those who can qualify for the historically low rate, it may be an extraordinary opportunity to buy or refinance. But low rates over the past year have done little to boost home sales or refinancing. Many people don't have enough cash or home equity to get a loan, or they are reluctant to take the risk in this market. Others have already refinanced because the average rate on the 30-year loan has been below 5 percent for most of the past year.

HEADLINE: Mid Market, at Last, May Be on the Cusp of Revival

BYLINE: By REYHAN HARMANCI. 
rharmanci@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
While Hal Fischer, interim director of S.F. Camerawork, pondered his organization's move to the Mid Market district, he conducted an experiment. About three months ago, he went to an 11 p.m. event at the nearby Luggage Store gallery and intentionally parked his car on Sixth and Market, a notoriously troubled block in the midst of one of the city's most crime-ridden areas.
''It did not feel dangerous,'' Mr. Fischer said. ''It didn't even feel unsavory. More than anything, it seemed eccentric. And I noticed a lot of tourists.'' 
And so S.F. Camerawork, a 37-year-old nonprofit fine arts photography gallery, has joined a growing list of arts organizations relocating to the Mid Market area, roughly defined as Market Street from Civic Center to Powell Street. S.F. Camerawork has signed a long-term lease -- Mr. Fischer did not disclose the exact length -- and hopes to inhabit the 3,600-square-foot space in December.
''After a lot of false starts, we think that this is it,'' Mr. Fischer said. ''Mid Market will really take off this time.''
While the long-awaited transformation of the area is far from complete, a distinct cultural flavor has begun to emanate from it. It is an experimental aesthetic, a style of creative risk that mirrors the pre-gentrified surroundings.
Other recent neighborhood newcomers include the Black Rock Arts Foundation (the nonprofit arm of Burning Man), Gray Area Foundation for the Arts (a digitally-minded arts space that moved from nearby Turk Street to a spot next to the Warfield Theater) and several coming retail ventures like Pearl's Deluxe Burgers on the corner of Sixth Street, and a bike repair shop.
For more established organizations, like the American Conservatory Theater, Mid Market provides an opportunity to test less traditional programming. Next week it begins performances at a newly renovated space at the Costume Shop at Seventh and Market, in conjunction with the Central Market Arts Festival, which runs through Oct. 16.
A.C.T. will continue to operate its main theater on Geary Street.
''We hope to do a lot of really flexible, down-and-dirty-style guerrilla theater,'' said Carey Perloff, artistic director of A.C.T., mentioning ''free beer'' and ''cheap tickets'' as incentives for visitors.
The Boxcar Theater company has two venues just off Market Street. ''Our audience is absolutely affected by location,'' said Nick A. Olivero, a co-founder of the company. ''We would not produce 'Guys and Dolls' in our area. We just did 'Little Shop of Horrors' and used the neighborhood to our advantage.''
But a total overhaul of the neighborhood, a la Times Square in New York, remains elusive. The Mayor's Office of Economic and Workforce Development -- working closely with the Northern California Community Loan Fund, Elvin Padilla Jr. of the Tenderloin Economic Development Project, building owners and a variety of arts organizations -- struggles to enliven the remnants of what was once called the Great White Way, a bustling, upscale theater district that existed in the first half of the 20th century. Deals have frequently fallen through or been stalled, crime is a grave concern and vacancy rates are still much higher than in surrounding neighborhoods.
Most notably, A.C.T.'s proposed $100 million multitheater complex at Turk and Market is in limbo after the property owner went into foreclosure. Mr. Padilla called the project crucial and ''the looming game-changer.''
The significant parcel of land -- almost a city block -- was slated to hold both a 300-seat theater and a 100-seat one, rehearsal spaces, a restaurant and even housing for A.C.T. visiting performers.
''We had it all ready to go,'' said Ellen Richard, A.C.T.'s executive director, before the news came in early summer that the hedge fund behind the property went bankrupt, and the land passed first to an Irish bank and then to a Texas investment firm. The theater company still wants to develop the space, she said.
Additionally, at least three other arts organizations that had publicly discussed moves to Mid Market -- Bay Area Video Coalition, the Pop Art Museum and the Museum of Craft and Design -- failed to sign leases.
Public financing remains a sticking point in the growth of the arts. Last year, Gavin Newsom, the mayor at the time, announced the Cultural District Loan Program to much fanfare: so far, only one business, a restaurant, has taken advantage of the money.
Gov. Jerry Brown's elimination of the state's redevelopment agencies in February was a bigger blow to hopes for long-term change.
''I feel like we take two steps forward, and then one back,'' said Kary Schulman, head of the Grants for the Arts.
But any step forward is enough for new Mid Market occupants whose programming caters to younger audiences. A recent stroll down Market at dusk hinted at the area's future: two glowing massive metal flower sculptures installed near Civic Center by Black Rock; a flickering yellow-hued video projected on the window of the second-floor Luggage Store gallery; curious tourists peering into the open doors of Gray Area Arts Foundation.
''The first time I raised this with some of our board, they looked at me like I was out of my mind,'' Mr. Fischer said, speaking of his organization's move. ''But this is the story of San Francisco, in spades.''

HEADLINE: Mass Transit Languishes. What's New?

BYLINE: By JAMES WARREN. 
jwarren@chicagonewscoop.org

 BODY:
A cultural anthropologist should stick inside a vault the tape of Forrest Claypool, head of the Chicago Transit Authority, addressing a sea of dark suits at the City Club of Chicago breakfast on Tuesday.
Mr. Claypool offered what the French call a tour d'horizon of a decaying transit system. In 25 years, researchers can find a reality about our age's view of public investment: we don't really believe in it.
When times are flush, the nation doesn't spend much on infrastructure unless lots of things are falling down. When times are bad, the country claims it has no money to spend. And these days, Tea Party enthusiasts object to infrastructure spending as quasi-Marxist, akin to the ''Obamacare'' they deride. 
We're like a guy who refuses to repair his crumbling house but has a dark walnut home-entertainment system with a 62-inch flat-screen television, and nearby Miller Lites and a popcorn machine. We prize the new and shiny, but are uninspired about fixing the old.
So here come Mr. Claypool and his boss, Mayor Rahm Emanuel, as a mass-transit cleanup crew armed with what amounts to squeegees and wishful thinking. They confront a giant deficit at the nation's second-largest system, after New York's, an even bigger debt to service, decaying rails and power stations, frustrating union contracts, and Springfield and Washington legislators who don't care if a rider going through a C.T.A. ''slow zone'' can read his free RedEye tabloid front to back twice.
Even the Missile's good intentions, pragmatism and penchant for promotion -- he set what may be a North American record on Wednesday with 14 press releases -- are not entirely convincing when heralding spruced-up El stops and LED bus-tracking signs. The moves merely bring us into the latter part of the 20th century.
Media coverage of the breakfast predictably focused on the short-term and the superficially sexy, namely the budget deficit and the supposedly wayward ways of the transit unions, be it pay higher than what counterparts get in other cities or high absenteeism.
Lost were the fundamental needs of a system that provides more than 1.6 million rides each weekday. Missed, too, is our collective ignorance about mass transit's central role in luring talent and expanding a healthy metropolitan economy. Cities around the world put us to shame.
What's playing out here mirrors what is happening with older transit systems nationwide. We strain to maintain the existing infrastructure, as opposed to expanding it. In Chicago, we also stare at prodigious debt-service costs after $544 million in C.T.A. borrowing the past four years, $100 million in mandated free and discounted rides annually, and a projected $136 million that must be diverted to Pace, the suburban transit provider, to handle soaring paratransit costs. Money is scarce, and everywhere there's talk of service cuts, higher fares, layoffs, use of reserve revenues and curtailing planned expansion, according to Robert Puentes, a mass-transit expert at the Brookings Institution.
Most American systems finance themselves or scrape for government peanuts as they jockey with local highway and tollway authorities. Worldwide, transit tends to be part of a larger policy-driven budget discussion in which city and suburban officials jointly execute long-term visions for a region, knowing that mass transit provides pools of labor and incentives for new businesses, to the benefit of all.
Washington coughs up more for new highways than for the long-term maintenance needs of mass transit. The C.T.A.'s own capital needs are estimated at $10 billion, including money to fix problems caused by ''boatloads of deferred maintenance in the 1970s and 1980s,'' said Peter Skosey, a vice president with the Metropolitan Planning Council.
Trying to navigate our mess is Mr. Claypool, who has voluntarily drawn a short straw of sorts after an eventful few years in elective politics.
He might be Cook County Board president if his friend Barack Obama, then a senator, hadn't waited until the day before the 2006 primary to support him. And last year, Mr. Claypool's insurgent campaign for Cook County assessor was upended by Joe Berrios, a prototypical Democratic machine insider and lobbyist.
For sure, Mr. Claypool's strong City Club PowerPoint presentation -- an homage to cities as engines of human progress -- strayed with an unconsciously class-driven slide contrasting how a C.T.A. janitor earns twice as much as a private contractor janitor at O'Hare.
I actually find many janitors underpaid and underappreciated. But when it comes to mass transit, that really isn't the problem, as Mr. Claypool's other slides for the elite pinstripers made clear.

HEADLINE: Pakistan Pulls Closer To a Reluctant China

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ

 BODY:
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan -- As relations with Washington plummeted in the aftermath of the killing of Osama bin Laden in May, Pakistan's leaders turned to China, which is seen here as an enduring all-weather friend, an alternative to the troublesome and overbearing Americans.
Over the years, Beijing has sent military assistance to Pakistan, provided crucial help in initiating Pakistan's nuclear weapons program and cooperated closely on intelligence. Sturdy Chinese-Pakistan relations are seen as a hedge against India, a rival to both nations. In recent months Pakistani officials have gone to Beijing seeking Chinese investment in a naval base and weapons, as well as trade deals worth millions of dollars.
But on closer examination, Pakistan's ability to use China to offset its collapsing relations with the United States may be far more limited than it appears, raising the prospect that Pakistan will be left on the world's periphery once the Americans wind down the war in Afghanistan and vastly reduce their presence in the region.
A rising China with global ambitions is unlikely to supplant the United States in Pakistan, according to Chinese experts on Pakistan, as well as Pakistani and American officials. And while Pakistan's latest flirtations with Beijing have been received cordially, Pakistani officials have walked away from their junkets with far less in hand than they might have hoped. 
As Pakistan's economy continues to decline, and the nation is beset by terrorist attacks, some Pakistanis are asking whether China will prove so helpful after all.
''We as a country may not figure as prominently in China's scheme of things as we believe we do,'' said an editorial on Sunday in The News, a leading English-language newspaper in Pakistan. ''Islamabad may be valuable for Beijing in strategic terms, and that leads us to the military and civilian nuclear cooperation between the two countries, but is Pakistan important for China in economic and political terms as well?''
Perhaps not. The two countries do indeed share a strategic interest in containing India, and China appears to do little to discourage Pakistan's expensive nuclear and conventional arms race with New Delhi. As such the Chinese military continues to play a major production role in developing Pakistan's weapons for the army, air force and navy, said retired Gen. Talat Masood, a former secretary of Defense Production.
But China's core interests lie elsewhere -- in its competition with the United States and in East Asia, experts say. China has shown little interest in propping up the troubled Pakistani economy, consistently passing up opportunities to do so.
The Chinese have built infrastructure projects in Pakistan -- notably a commercial port at Gwadar on the Arabian Sea -- but have pulled back on some as they have come under the threat of terrorism, and where Chinese workers have been killed. Last month a large Chinese coal mining company, China Kingho Group, canceled a $19 billion contract in Sindh Province, citing concerns about security, in particular employees' safety.
And like the United States, China, too, worries about Pakistan's inability to curb terrorism, though China's focus is almost singularly on the ethnic Uighur separatists who operate out of Pakistan and seek to destabilize the neighboring, energy-rich region of Xinjiang. In August, local authorities in Xinjiang charged that the leader of a Uighur separatist group, held responsible for terrorist attacks that left more than 20 dead in the city of Kashgar, had been trained in Pakistan.
The Chinese rebuke, repeated in the China Daily newspaper, was unusually blunt. The head of Pakistan's intelligence service, Lt. Gen. Ahmed Shuja Pasha, in Beijing at the time, returned to deliver reassurances. The Pakistani president, Asif Ali Zardari, a frequent visitor to China in search of business deals, made amends by visiting Xinjiang, pledging to contain terrorism.
On China's western flank with Pakistan, Xinjiang was once dominated by ethnic Uighurs, but now ethnic Han make up more than half the population. The region is particularly sensitive because it covers one-sixth of China's land mass, and the Chinese leadership, which has encouraged the Han migration, has announced plans for widespread development there.
''It's very important for China for Pakistan to be stable,'' said Du Bing, assistant professor at the Institute of Asian and African Studies in Beijing. ''Because if it's not stable we can't keep the peace in Xinjiang.''
Among the demands almost certainly made to General Pasha during his visits to Beijing were a need for the Pakistanis to ensure that Uighur extremist leaders did not rise in the ranks of Al Qaeda after Bin Laden's death, two Chinese experts on Pakistan said, requesting anonymity because of the delicacy of the matter.
The Pakistani Army, aware of China's alarm, has been on the lookout for Uighur extremists in the past decade, killing an important leader in 2003 and providing information that led to the death of his successor in an American drone attack in 2010.
Even so, the stern Chinese reaction to the attacks in Xinjiang was a warning for Pakistan, said Mushahid Hussain, the chairman of the Pakistan China Institute in Islamabad. ''The primary onus is on Pakistani policy makers, both in mufti and khaki, to take the fallout of Kashgar seriously, for its recurrence can be detrimental to our bilateral bond,'' Mr. Hussain wrote in a widely distributed article.
Amid the anti-American rage in Pakistan after the killing of Bin Laden in May, Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani flew to China in what was portrayed in the Pakistani news media as a major snub to the United States.
But Mr. Gilani, at least publicly, was unable to coax much out of the Chinese. Trade between the two countries remains anemic -- nearly $9 billion, with Pakistan's share only $1 billion. China's trade with India exploded from $2.9 billion in 2000 to $61 billion last year.
During the visit, the defense minister, Ahmad Mukhtar, asked China to build a naval base at Gwadar, the port on the Arabian Sea where China completed commercial facilities in 2008.
The request was met with silence. For the moment, China does not see Gwadar as being of much strategic value, several Chinese experts on Pakistan said.
Since its completion, the port has become a rusting hulk, a destination to nowhere. The cost of building the roads and railway that would connect Gwadar with China, across the perilous territory of Baluchistan and up the mountainous terrain of northern Pakistan, was deemed too high, they said.
But on projects of immediate strategic importance to China, Beijing is moving ahead.
The construction in Punjab Province of two new nuclear reactors, known as Chashma III and Chashma IV, were announced by China in early 2010.
China approved the reactors after the George W. Bush administration, as part of its strategy to strengthen India as a bulwark against China, devised a civilian nuclear deal that gave India access to nuclear reactors, fuel and technology on the world market.
Neither Pakistan nor China made any secret of the fact that the new Chinese reactors were a tit-for-tat against the United States-India nuclear alliance, yet another pointer to the notion that, for the moment, China will use Pakistan for a modicum of strategic interests, but not much beyond.

(Stacey Anderson) 
- Deadmau5 (Friday through Sunday) This Canadian dance producer concludes his six-night residency at Roseland with all of his trademark enticements: excellently deep progressive house and neo-trance music, staggering digital stage graphics and a terrifyingly oversized mouse head that he will wear determinedly through the night.

At noon, Fulton Street, between New York and Brooklyn Avenues, Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, (718) 636-6900, restorationplaza.org; free. (Anderson)
The Script (Thursday) Danny O'Donoghue, the lead singer of these sweeping soft rockers, treads a curious path in his balladry: he's frankly emotive, with the buttery inflections and dreamily romantic postures of a former teen idol. Yet he's clearly also a scamp, occasionally dropping profanity into his gentle anthems with no purpose or accord. Is Coldplay having this much fun? With Hot Chelle Rae. At 8 p.m., Roseland Ballroom, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (800) 745-3000, roselandballroom.com; $37.50. (Anderson)

Shows continue various dates through Oct. 22. At 8 p.m., St. Ann's Warehouse, 38 Water Street, at Dock Street, Dumbo, Brooklyn, (866) 811-4111, stannswarehouse.org; $55 and $65. (Anderson)
- Suuns (Friday) These prog-rockers from Montreal take Hemingway-esque economy with their tunes, stacking small fragments of dissonant melody into dense, enormous waves.

At 10:15 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (800) 745-3000, mercuryloungenyc.com; $10 in advance and $12 at the door. (Anderson)
- Sidi Toure (Thursday) As a child, Mr. Toure broke the conventions of his royal Malian family by learning the guitar and joining a regional orchestra. His second album of minimal, songhai-language desert blues, ''Sahel Folk'' (Thrill Jockey), reaffirms what a wonderful decision that was. At 8:30 p.m., David Rubenstein Atrium at Lincoln Center, Broadway between 62nd and 63rd Streets, lincolncenter.org; free. (Anderson)
Gordon Voidwell (Saturday) This electro-crooner from the Bronx is en route to giving Prince a run for his money -- not just in his featherweight funk croons and catchy analog beats, but also in his hyper-trendy sartorial choices of natty suits and plentiful patterns. His latest single, ''Ivy League Circus,'' is raucous fun. At 11:59 p.m., Brooklyn Bowl, 61 Wythe Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 963-3369, brooklynbowl.com; $5 in advance; $7 at the door. (Anderson)
Women of the Calabash (Saturday) Named for the hollowed gourd that serves as one of their instruments, this American ensemble revisits traditional music from Africa, the Caribbean and North and South America. Socially charged and beautifully balanced, their earthy harmonies and instrumentation are a warmly powerful experience. At 2 p.m., Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400, symphonyspace.org; $11 to $20. (Anderson)
- Yuck (Thursday) This young and breathlessly buzzed-about band from London pulls heavily from Pavement, Red House Painters and other cagey 1990s alt-rockers. The rich melodies and smartly distilled guitars on the band's self-titled debut (on Fat Possum), as well as its authentically awkward stage demeanor, speak well of its scholarship. With Porcelain Raft and Gross Magic. At 9 p.m., Music Hall of Williamsburg, 66 North Sixth Street, Brooklyn, (800) 745-3000, musichallofwilliamsburg.com; $15. (Anderson)

HEADLINE: Strong Retail Sales Send Issues Higher for 3rd Day

BYLINE: By JOSHUA BRUSTEIN; David Jolly contributed from Paris.

 BODY:
Wall Street registered gains for the third consecutive day on Thursday, following European stocks higher after central banks in Europe took action to increase liquidity. Economic data, including retail sales, also showed an American economy that is performing better than expected.
The Standard and Poor's 500-stock index rose 20.94 points, or 1.83 percent, to 1,164.97, and has risen 5.9 percent since Monday. 
On Friday, the Labor Department is scheduled to release its jobs report for September, one of the most highly anticipated indicators of the economy.
Weekly jobless claims rose 6,000, to 401,000, from a revised level of 395,000 last week, the Labor Department said Thursday. The four-week moving average was 414,000, which was 4,000 lower than the previous month and slightly better than analysts' expectations.
President Obama held a news conference on Thursday to pressure Congress to pass his jobs legislation, and said he was comfortable with a proposal to place a surtax on income over $1 million to cover the bill's $445 billion cost.
A report on retail sales for September showed the biggest increase in sales since May at stores open at least a year. The companies tracked by Thomson Reuters posted a 5.1 increase in sales, beating analysts' estimates.
''Last week, when the market was in free fall, the idea was that a recession was inevitable. We're clearly not out the woods yet, but I think it's less likely,'' said Byron Wien, the vice chairman of Blackstone Advisory Partners.
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 183.38 points, or 1.68 percent, to 11,123.33. The Nasdaq composite index rose 46.31 points, or 1.88 percent, to 2,506.82.
Financial companies, which have been hit hard during the market's recent downturn, performed strongly. Bank of America's shares rose 51 cents, or 8.84 percent, to $6.28. Citigroup jumped $1.31, or 5.3 percent, to $26.02. Wells Fargo gained 87 cents, or 3.55 percent, to $25.37.
The benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 29/32, to 101 6/32, and its yield rose to 1.99 percent, up from 1.89 percent late Wednesday.
The European Central Bank moved to help European banks that are having trouble raising short-term cash, while the Bank of England decided to resume its bond purchases to help support a slowing British economy. Both central banks left their benchmark rates unchanged, at 1.5 percent for the euro area covered by the European Central Bank and 0.5 percent for Britain.
While most economists did not expect a rate cut, some said they were disappointed with the central bank's actions, particularly because this was the last policy meeting to be headed by Jean-Claude Trichet, who will be replaced by Mario Draghi, governor of the Bank of Italy, on Nov. 1. Mr. Draghi will face pressure not to cut rates immediately to establish his credentials as an inflation fighter, analysts said.
The Bank of England's resumption of its bond-buying program was a surprise, said Mark McCormick, a currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman, a boutique banking firm in New York.
''Bank of England exceeded the markets' expectations, the E.C.B., I would say, disappointed. But they're both trying to ease financial conditions and in turn support economic growth from a monetary perspective,'' he said.
The banks' actions caused European currencies to fall against the dollar.
Longer term, however, the picture remained as murky as ever, and financial markets continued to face what strategists at HSBC, in their latest quarterly assessment, called ''an unbearable degree of uncertainty.''
After falling 22 percent from their April highs, global equities are likely to remain tricky,'' wrote Garry Evans, head of global equity strategy at HSBC in Hong Kong. ''There are few signs of a bold solution to Europe's sovereign debt issues and the 23 November deadline for U.S. debt negotiations looms.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Jobless Claims Rise

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
New claims for unemployment benefits in the United States rose last week, the government said on Thursday, but the increase was less than expected and hinted at an improvement in labor market conditions. 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits climbed 6,000, to a seasonally adjusted 401,000, the Labor Department said, from a revised 395,000 for the previous week.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast that claims would rise to 410,000 from the previously reported 391,000.
The four-week moving average of claims for unemployment benefits, considered a better measure of labor market trends, fell 4,000, to 414,000.
The weekly data falls outside the survey period for the government's closely watched employment report for September, which will be released on Friday. The jobless rate is expected to remain steady at 9.1 percent.
Difficulties adjusting first-time applications for seasonal fluctuations had resulted in a big drop the previous week. Despite the increase last week, claims remained close to the 400,000 mark, which economists usually associate with some improvement in the labor market.
The weak labor market is the Achilles' heel of the recovery, which is threatened by the debt crisis in Europe. Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, said on Tuesday the recovery was ''close to faltering'' and reiterated the Fed's commitment to take additional steps to aid growth.

HEADLINE: Vinyl Valhalla

BYLINE: By AMANDA PETRUSICH

 BODY:
IN an era when eulogies for record stores are more common than the stores themselves, buying vinyl can feel as virtuous as shopping for locally grown produce or rejecting plastic bags. It can also be a lonely pursuit. Often record buyers are stuck refreshing auction Web sites, browsing half-empty aisles or flipping past copy after copy of Dan Fogelberg's ''Greatest Hits'' at a thrift shop.
For crate diggers desperate to commune with other fans as they expand their collections, however, there's always that vestige of old media, the record fair.
Saturday in Brooklyn will offer two side-by-side spreads along the East River in Williamsburg: the Brooklyn Flea's Superstar DJ Record Fair and its sister event, the Independent Label Market. Then, from Oct. 28 to 30, the community-supported radio station WFMU will hold its annual record and CD fair in a 30,000-square-foot space in Chelsea. 
Despite pessimism about the future of music as something that can be bought and crammed in a tote bag, WFMU has had attendance at its fair increase steadily; last year more than 4,000 shoppers perused its famously esoteric offerings. According to the station manager, Ken Freedman, the demographics have slowly shifted to include women and college students, and the archetypal record fair attendee -- a middle-aged man clutching a notebook full of serial numbers -- is no longer omnipresent.
Along with the Austin Record Convention in Texas (held the week before the WFMU fair, Mr. Freedman explained, so that international buyers can attend both) and the Mega Record and CD Fair in the Netherlands in November, Mr. Freedman cites WFMU's event as ''one of the predominant record fairs in the world.''
Part of the success of the fair, which Mr. Freedman founded in 1993 at the Elks Lodge in Hoboken, N.J., can be attributed to the variety of offerings. ''It's always been vinyl heavy,'' he said, ''but there are lots of things available: CDs, DVDs, posters, T-shirts, live performances, movies, contests and a conference about the future of radio.''
That conference, called Radiovision, is a first for WFMU this year and is expected to be a chief draw, with speakers including the public-radio personality Ira Glass, the WFMU host and TV writer Tom Scharpling and the comedian and podcast host Marc Maron.
''It's very important to us to offer things to people who are no longer interested in physical recordings,'' Mr. Freedman said. ''Because there are a lot of them.''
Eric Demby, a founder of the Brooklyn Flea, helped introduce the Superstar DJ Record Fair in 2008. This year it will feature around 20 vendors of vintage LPs (and a few CDs too). Located inside Smorgasburg, the Brooklyn Flea's weekly food market, the fair will also feature a children's disco hosted by the D.J.'s Justin Carter and Eamon Harkin, known for the roving dance party Mister Saturday Night.
''They'll be playing a lot of disco and soul music -- adult music that cool kids will want to dance to,'' Mr. Demby said.
Meanwhile, the potential merchandise -- including a 1952 limited-edition autographed copy of ''The Astaire Story,'' on four blue-vinyl LPs, and Crosby Stills and Nash's self-titled 1969 album with an upside-down photo inside -- will probably get record hounds salivating.
For freshly pressed releases, and a little friendly interaction with the people who helped create them, the Independent Label Market will feature booths staffed by the employees of celebrated indie labels like XL, 4AD, Domino, Mexican Summer, DFA, Sacred Bones, Secretly Canadian, Jagjaguwar and Young Turks.
The inaugural market, held in London this spring, was organized by Katie Riding of Bang On PR and Joe Daniel of Angular Recordings. The idea coalesced while Mr. Daniel was filling in at the merchandise table for These New Puritans, a moody art-rock band.
''They were in Berlin, and there was no one there to do the selling of the T-shirts and whatnot,'' Mr. Daniel explained. ''So I did it. And it reminded me of what it was like when I first started the label. As things develop, you get separated from that by P.R. people and distributors and all that stuff. You get quite removed from the first point of contact with customers. It was fun to meet the people who liked buying the records.''
For label owners at the London market, the opportunity to interact directly with buyers felt novel, even intimidating. ''As it got nearer to the day, everyone was anticipating it in a slightly funny way; I heard that Daniel Miller from Mute asked Laurence from Domino what he was going to wear,'' Mr. Daniel said. ''There was mild trepidation about how it would pan out, because it was a new experience for all of us.''
In Brooklyn, participating labels are bringing rare and colored vinyl, limited editions and signed merchandise. Jonathan Galkin, a founder of DFA Records, will be offering a variety of coveted releases from the label's back catalog.
''We're going to set up bins of every classic 12-inch we've released, from LCD Soundsystem to Hercules and Love Affair to Hot Chip to Yacht,'' he said.
Early attendees can snatch up exclusive releases: Young Turks Records will be putting out 20 white-label vinyl copies of a seven-minute remix of Radiohead's ''Bloom,'' by Jamie xx of the spare British pop band the xx. The track is otherwise unavailable, and the label has no plans to release it electronically. Don't linger in the coffee line; it will most likely sell out in minutes.
Where to Find Those Turntable Treasures: SUPERSTAR DJ RECORD FAIR AND INDEPENDENT LABEL MARKET Saturday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., 27 North Sixth Street, between Kent Avenue and the East River, Williamsburg, Brooklyn; brooklynflea.com/2011/09/09/recordfair.

On Saturday admission to Radiovision is an additional $80; $40 for students and the unemployed.

Nashville country doesn't play well in Texas, but Dolly Parton gets a pass. Besides being perpetually endearing, Ms. Parton starred in the cult-classic movie ''The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas,'' about a real bordello in La Grange. As Mona Stangley, the no-nonsense, pistol-packing madam of the Chicken Ranch, Ms. Parton wooed both the local sheriff, played by Burt Reynolds, and a fictional Texas A&M football team.
For the film, released in 1982, she re-recorded her hit song ''I Will Always Love You,'' and saw it again shoot to the top of the country charts nearly a decade after it was originally released. Lovers will rejoice in hearing a live version of the song -- a staple of her concerts -- when Ms. Parton returns to Texas in support of ''Better Day,'' her uplifting new studio album. 
''It seemed that with everything being so doomsday -- terrorists and bad weather and unemployment -- we need a little sunshine,'' Ms. Parton told Billboard.

At the Witte Museum, visitors get the art right down to its bones. The collection of 200,000 artifacts is full of items acquired directly from the South Texans whose culture the museum celebrates, including many items obtained by local military personnel while abroad.
''It's the people's museum,'' said Marise McDermott, the museum's president and chief executive. ''We're a safe haven for civic discourse.''
Saturday is the 85th birthday of the Witte, long known as ''the attic of South Texas,'' and for one day only, admission will be 85 cents.
Divide your time between three commemorative exhibitions in the fields of natural history, art history and science: ''Opening the Witte Wardrobe,'' fashions of the times; ''Out of the Vault,'' samples of the permanent collection, including a mounted jaguar, American Indian objects and paintings belonging to what Ms. McDermott calls the best 19th-century Texas art collection; and ''Witte Through Time,'' photographs of the museum's past, with an eye toward the future.

The Big Game
The natives are restless over the potential loss of the rivalry between Texas A&M and its in-state nemesis, Texas, now that the Aggies are packing up their tackle dummies and leaving the Big 12 Conference for the Southeastern Conference. But the truth is that the annual Thanksgiving game between those two schools has increasingly paled in comparison to the Red River Rivalry between the Longhorns and the Oklahoma Sooners.
In 2005, 119 college football coaches ranked that interstate, neutral-field showdown the best in the country, and 5 of the last 10 B.C.S. National Championship Games have included either Texas or Oklahoma. Both teams head into this season's contest undefeated.
Many experts give the young, inexperienced Longhorns little chance against the Sooners, ranked No. 3 by The Associated Press, but with the mojo rising of newly-installed quarterbacks Case McCoy and David Ash, it just might end up a nail-biter.

Roses are red. Republicans are, too. This may explain why at the Texas Rose Festival, Jenna Bush Hager and Kenneth Starr will be speaking to you. But those hosts of the ladies' and men's luncheons will shirk politics in favor of rhapsodizing on the most romantic flower known to man.
Roses are plentiful in the area east of Dallas. In fact, more than half of the nation's rose bushes come from there. Hundreds of thousands of the beauties will provide the backdrop for a weekend that combines the glitz of a beauty pageant, the elegance of a royal wedding and the wonderment of the Rose Bowl parade.
Visit the Tyler Rose Museum to learn how roses supplanted peaches as the area's staple and then see the coronation of the Rose Queen. As with the festival's early years, when it was the silver lining to the Depression, so does it now offer a reprieve from deflated times.

HEADLINE: F.C.C. Plans to Overhaul Telecom Fund to Focus on Expanding Broadband

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The chairman of the Federal Communications Commission on Thursday outlined a plan to transform the Universal Service Fund, an $8 billion fund that is paid for by the nation's telephone customers and used to subsidize basic telephone service in rural areas, into one that will help expand broadband Internet service to 18 million Americans who lack high-speed access.
The chairman, Julius Genachowski, said the overhaul of the fund would eliminate waste and inefficiencies in a program that is outdated, unfair and not accountable to the consumers who support it through monthly assessments on their phone bills. 
An F.C.C. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid overshadowing the chairman's address, said the amount that consumers paid each month to finance universal service was unlikely to fall and could increase. Phone companies are assessed a percentage of their revenue from interstate and international service, and most pass along those charges to customers. The contribution rate has more than doubled over the last decade, to 15 percent currently, up from 7 percent in 2001.
Telecommunications industry groups and consumer watchdog organizations offered cautious support for the plan. Though Mr. Genachowski presented an overview of a new system, he offered few details on how it would affect phone companies and broadband providers.
''Broadband has gone from being a luxury to being a necessity for full participation in our economy and society,'' Mr. Genachowski said in a speech Thursday at the agency's headquarters. ''This plan will bring enormous benefits to individual consumers, our national economy and our global competitiveness.''
The plan would provide for broadband in hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses beginning next year, Mr. Genachowski said, and would cut by half the number of Americans without broadband access by 2017. ''And it will put us on the path to universal broadband service by the end of the decade,'' he added.
The plan would transform the largest component of the fund, which provides $4.5 billion annually to subsidize residential phone service in rural areas that would otherwise be uneconomical for companies to serve.
The money would instead go to a new Connect America Fund, providing both wired and wireless Internet access to homes, businesses and ''anchor institutions'' like libraries and public service organizations.
Subsidies for landline telephone service will be phased out as broadband is expanded, but the F.C.C. chairman said he believed that the development of Internet-based phone services like Skype would supplant traditional telephones for many consumers.
For the first time, the Universal Service Fund will be put on an annual budget, rather than being allowed to spend freely, Mr. Genachowski said, and competitive bidding will be used to determine which companies receive subsidies -- also a first.
Part of the money will be used to establish a Mobility Fund, which would extend and sustain the latest generation of mobile broadband service along and around more than 100,000 miles of roadways around the country, ''where millions of Americans live, work and travel,'' he said.
Also outlined Thursday were changes to the Intercarrier Compensation program, which provides subsidies for local phone companies through an assessment on long-distance calls.
That system, Mr. Genachowski said, ''actually discourages investment in 21st-century Internet protocol networks, because companies fear losing the subsidies they receive for connecting calls using traditional telephone technology.''
Details on the full plan outlined by Mr. Genachowski are being circulated to the three other F.C.C. commissioners. They can suggest revisions and amendments to shape the final regulations, which will be voted on by the commission on Oct. 27.
Because of the lack of details, consumer and industry groups generally said they would have to review the final plan before reacting fully to the proposals.
''We applaud Chairman Genachowski for his commitment to connecting all Americans to high-speed broadband,'' said Walter B. McCormick Jr., president and chief executive of USTelecom, a broadband industry trade association. ''While we have some concerns with what he outlined today, we appreciate that he and his fellow commissioners are looking to find the right balance that will benefit consumers, advance the public interest, accelerate broadband investment and create jobs.''
Parul P. Desai, policy counsel for Consumers Union, similarly supported the initiative, but she said that the F.C.C. should not allow companies to raise the rates they charge for landlines, because many seniors and lower-income households will continue to depend on that service.
''Broadband companies are generating huge revenues while many consumers are struggling to make ends meet,'' Ms. Desai said. ''The F.C.C. shouldn't allow the industry to pay for expansion on the backs of consumers.''

HEADLINE: Trying Out New Ways To Deliver Health Care

BYLINE: By EMILY RAMSHAW. 
eramshaw@texastribune.org

 BODY:
PLANO, Tex. -- At Village Health Partners, patients receive a year's worth of wellness exams in a single visit; get their e-mails answered 24 hours a day, 7 days a week; and have their mammogram and M.R.I. results logged into their electronic medical records by the time they pull out of the parking lot.
Kelsey-Seybold in Houston is the galleria of health clinics: it has storefronts for every imaginable specialty; online, same-day, no-referral-necessary appointment scheduling; an on-site pharmacy; and even free valet parking.
As the United States grapples with rising health care costs and a system that rewards doctors and hospitals for how sick their patients get, not how healthy they become, Texas health care providers are increasingly experimenting with new payment and care delivery models -- joining forces to emphasize efficiency and outcomes. 
These new models present a culture shift for the state's physicians. But they have provided an intriguing benefit for patients, drawn to the convenience and comfort of a system financially motivated to keep them as well as possible.
''Doctors in Texas traditionally haven't wanted to share resources, to share financial risk, to share clinical information,'' said Tom Banning, chief executive of the Texas Academy of Family Physicians. ''But there are pioneering groups here that are putting an emphasis on quality and cost efficiency. They're innovative nationally, and they're moving the ball.''
The nation faces an undeniable crisis in health spending. By 2020, the country's health expenditures are expected to reach $4.6 trillion a year, almost 20 percent of the gross domestic product. Roughly half of this spending comes in government programs, a potentially catastrophic hit to state and federal budgets.
Health care experts say the leading contributor to escalating costs is the dominant fee-for-service payment system, in which doctors and hospitals are paid per treatment or procedure and make more when patients get infections or complications. But they fear returning to the health maintenance organization model that limited patient choice and gave doctors a financial incentive to ration care.
The solution, health care providers including Village Health Partners and Kelsey-Seybold believe, is clinical integration -- in which groups of family physicians and specialists share electronic patient information, the costs of case management and care coordination, and the latest research on best practices, all with the symbiotic goal of keeping costs low and patients well.
Texas is not blazing a brand-new trail. Nationally, health systems like the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, the Geisinger Health System in Pennsylvania and Intermountain Healthcare in Utah have long taken this value-over-volume approach. Scott & White Healthcare, with its 12 system hospitals and more than 60 clinics, has led the integrated-care charge in Central Texas.
But with the rollout of the federal health overhaul, and new Texas legislation tended to pay for performance, not procedures, more Texas providers may join the movement. Last month, the United States Department of Health and Human Services started a pilot program to pay primary care practices a monthly fee if they provide better chronic-care management, give patients 24-hour access to care and health information, and collaborate with specialists to better coordinate care.
The Kelsey-Seybold clinic has been a gold standard for the multispecialty group practice since it opened in 1949. Today it employs 373 physicians across 55 specialties in 20 different facilities -- all of them with in-house labs and X-rays, and wired for the same electronic medical record. Its flagship clinic, which opened in 1999, looks like a gleaming shopping mall, with storefronts for a multitude of services, from pediatrics to women's health to day surgery. But its most innovative approach may be KelseyCare, a four-year-old so-called accountable-care plan offered through Cigna in which patients, via their employers, have all their health care for a single year provided at a fixed, customized rate.
''The real focus ought to be on how much it costs to care for a group of patients over a period of time and achieve desirable outcomes,'' said Dr. Spencer R. Berthelsen, Kelsey-Seybold's chairman and managing director. ''There's way too much attention on unit cost -- what is the cost of an office visit or a laboratory test or a day in the hospital.''
To make KelseyCare work outside the fee-for-service model, the clinic relies heavily on electronic medical records to prevent duplication in tests run or treatments provided. It has automated best-practice alerts, to make sure patients get regular immunizations or mammograms that could prevent costly ailments down the line. And it has made it convenient for its patients -- including three-quarters of the City of Houston's employees -- to get the preventative care they need to stay well, from offering same-day online appointments to housing specialists mere feet from their primary care partners.
At Village Health Partners, the anchor tenant for the 100,000-square-foot Legacy Medical Village in Plano, the payment model has not shifted from fee-for-service yet. The various physician practices at Legacy remain independent, and their doctors self-employed. But Dr. Christopher Crow, the founder of Village Health, has a similar idea: attract patients by making care accessible, convenient and high quality, and reinvest the profits into measuring what works.
As a family medicine physician fresh out of medical school, Dr. Crow watched, frustrated, as his patients waited days for lab results and weeks to get in to see specialists, while their health suffered. ''It was like going to McDonald's and being told to come back in four days,'' Dr. Crow said. ''I wanted to build a place where everything was built around access and convenience.''
So he did, opening Legacy Medical Village, a sprawling health complex that four years later is now home to 14 primary care physicians and 30 different services and specialty practices that provide comprehensive treatment, from oncology and bariatric surgery to physical therapy.
Legacy Medical Village has a wide range of tenants: a workers' compensation program, behavioral and weight loss therapy, a sleep study center and a headache department. It runs research trials and has an in-house dentist.
But care is centered on the family medicine linchpin, Village Health Partners, which coordinates the care of its 45,000 patients with electronic records technology, case managers, around-the-clock e-mail responses and a guarantee that phones will be answered within 60 seconds.
Dr. Crow said the model could be reproduced virtually anywhere, once Texas doctors get past their fierce independent streak.
''Anywhere there's a population of patients who need health care, these synergies can be stuck together,'' he said. ''The individual models foster zero coordination of care. The physician-led organization is the solution.''

HEADLINE: Treasury Secretary Urges Quick Action on Jobs Plan

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner told Congress on Thursday that legislative action was required to buttress the American economy, particularly as economic conditions in Europe continued to deteriorate.
Mr. Geithner urged passage of the Obama administration's jobs plan, warning that the economy remains weak and that a failure to act would raise taxes for families and businesses, as existing tax breaks lapse at the end of the year.
''In the face of the situation in Europe, and the general slowdown across the world, the most important thing we can do is take strong steps to strengthen our economy at home,'' Mr. Geithner told a Senate committee. 
In addition to stimulating domestic growth, Mr. Geithner said the Obama administration was responding in two ways to the problems in Europe: by encouraging European leaders to move more quickly and forcefully and by monitoring the health of the financial system.
''Developments in Europe can have big effects on the United States economy, big effects on confidence, big effects on financial markets,'' he said.
The back-to-back hearings before Senate and House committees, Mr. Geithner's first public appearance on Capitol Hill in several months, offered a microcosm of the political divisions that have paralyzed Washington. Democrats pressed for fresh government action to spur growth, create jobs and help homeowners facing foreclosure. Republicans said the government was preventing growth and urged a primary focus on reducing federal spending and borrowing.
Both sides described their policies as necessary to restore the confidence of businesses and consumers, who have been holding back on spending, a crucial reason for the relatively slow pace of economic growth.
Mr. Geithner said that the summer debate over the debt ceiling had undermined public confidence in the ability of political leaders. He said that the economy also was suffering from a surfeit of caution, particularly on the part of financial companies that are avoiding riskier loans for fear of renewed losses.
''If you look at the economy at the moment, the biggest risk we face is institutions not taking enough risk,'' Mr. Geithner said.
Spencer Bachus, the Alabama Republican who is chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, responded sharply to this account, asserting that banks were avoiding risks because of the heavy hand of government regulators.
''I'm not sure you have a clear picture of reality,'' he told Mr. Geithner.
Other Republicans took up the same point, arguing that the lack of confidence reflected a significant increase in government regulation, the overhang of federal debt and fear of additional government interference.
Addressing similar comments from another Republican lawmaker later in the hearing, Mr. Geithner responded, ''The argument that what's hurting the economy now is an excess of regulation is without foundation.''
The Treasury secretary also faced unusually sharp questioning from Democrats frustrated by the failure of the White House to help homeowners facing foreclosure, expand access to mortgage loans or stabilize home prices.
Representative Luis Gutierrez, an Illinois Democrat, faultedMr. Geithner over the recently concluded Home Affordable Mortgage Program, which managed to spend almost none of its $50 billion budget for mortgage loan modifications.
''It's terrible,'' Mr. Gutierrez said.
Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island, told Mr. Geithner that it was ''certainly the perception on Main Street'' that the economy could not recover until the housing market was stabilized, including a reduction in the number of foreclosures.
''We haven't d0one enough,'' Mr. Reed said.
Mr. Geithner said that he agreed that the administration's efforts had not met expectations, and he pointed to efforts by the Federal Housing Finance Agency to reduce barriers to refinancing, which he said could be introduced next week.
''We are doing as much as we can with the authority we have to help people caught up in this crisis,'' Mr. Geithner said.

HEADLINE: Estranged Bedfellows

BYLINE: By A. O. SCOTT

 BODY:
Mike Morris, the governor of Pennsylvania in ''The Ides of March,'' is an image of the liberal heart's desire, and not only because he is played by George Clooney. Morris, who keeps his cool while inflaming the passions of Democratic primary voters, is a committed environmentalist and a forthright secularist who sidesteps questions about his faith by professing that his religion is the United States Constitution. He is against war and in favor of jobs, though the economy figures much less in his fictitious campaign than it will in the real one just around the corner.
In spite of Morris's party affiliation and expressed positions -- which are tailored to sound both vague and provocative -- ''The Ides of March'' is not an ideological fairy tale. It is easy enough, while watching Morris in action, to substitute a different set of talking points and imagine the governor as a Republican dream candidate, smoothly defending low taxes and traditional values in the same seductive whisper. (Who is the right-wing George Clooney? Is Tom Selleck still available?) 
But it is difficult, really, to connect this fable to the world it pretends to represent. Whatever happens in 2012, within either party or in the contest between them, it seems fair to say that quite a lot will be at stake. That is not the case in ''The Ides of March,'' which is less an allegory of the American political process than a busy, foggy, mildly entertaining antidote to it.
Morris, locked in a battle for the nomination with a colorless (and barely seen) Senator Pullman (Michael Mantell), is a bit of a cipher, or perhaps a symbol. He stands for an ideal of political charisma that the film, directed by Mr. Clooney and based on the play ''Farragut North'' by Beau Willimon, sets out to tarnish. And yet it seems doubtful, after more than a decade of scandal, acrimony and bare-knuckled media brawling, that this noble fantasy exists anywhere but in the minds of writers and actors who look back fondly on the glorious make-believe administrations of Henry Fonda and Martin Sheen.
''You stay in this business long enough, you get jaded and cynical,'' one campaign staffer says to another. ''The Ides of March'' sets out first to rebut this bit of conventional wisdom, then to reaffirm it. It is in large part the tale of a professional politico's loss of innocence. Not Morris's, but that of Stephen Meyers, a young hotshot on the governor's campaign staff who is played, with sad-eyed intensity, by Ryan Gosling. His prodigious talents are mentioned rather than shown, but we can accept that he is both a dazzling tactical brain and, what's more, a true believer, working for Morris because he thinks Morris is the last, best hope for America.
Stephen's boss is Paul Zara (Philip Seymour Hoffman), whose counterpart in the Pullman campaign is Tom Duffy, played by Paul Giamatti. ''The Ides of March'' feels most alive and truest to its ostensible subject when these two soft-bellied, sharp-tongued schlubs do battle, with the angelic Stephen in the middle. Hovering around him like a crow circling carrion is Marisa Tomei as Ida Horowicz, a New York Times reporter who might be the only journalist covering the campaign or at least the only one with a speaking part in the movie. (Go team!)
But what political drama there is in this film -- will Morris win the Ohio primary? Will his staff cut a deal with a vain and imperious North Carolina senator (Jeffrey Wright)? -- is scaffolding rather than substance. As the Shakespearean title suggests, ''The Ides of March'' has loftier, less time-bound matters on its mind: the nature of honor, the price of loyalty, the ways that a man's actions are a measure of his character.
These themes, swathed in Alexandre Desplat's dark-hued score and Phedon Papamichael's chocolate-and-burgundy cinematography, come into relief as Stephen encounters turbulence in his career and his personal life. He stumbles into a professional flirtation with Duffy, and almost simultaneously into some hot campaign sex with Molly Stearns (Evan Rachel Wood), a young woman who is -- no points for guessing right -- an intern. She also has a powerful daddy and a secret in her past that has the potential to send Stephen's career and the Morris campaign into a tailspin.
Mr. Clooney handles the plot complications with elegant dexterity. As an actor, he works best in long, understated scenes that allow him to play with nuances of charm and menace, so it is not surprising that, as a director, he gives the rest of the cast room to work. But the parts of ''The Ides of March'' -- quiet scenes between Mr. Gosling and Ms. Wood; swirling, Sorkinesque exchanges of banter; any time Ms. Tomei or Max Minghella (as a campaign worker grooming himself to be the next Stephen Meyers) are in the room -- are greater than the whole.
Somehow, the film is missing both adrenaline and gravity, notwithstanding some frantic early moments and a late swerve toward tragedy. It makes its points carefully and unimpeachably but does not bring much in the way of insight or risk. Powerful men often treat women as sexual playthings. Reporters do not always get things right. Politicians sometimes lie. If any of that sounds like news to you, then you may well find ''The Ides of March'' downright electrifying.
More likely, though, you will find it more comforting than inspiring. It deals mainly in platitudes and abstractions, with just enough detail to hold your interest and keep you hoping for something more. Kind of like a campaign speech, come to think of it.
''The Ides of March'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Sex, bad language, dirty politics.

HEADLINE: Protests Offer Obama Opportunity to Gain, and Room for Pitfalls

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Anti-Wall Street protesters marched past the gates of the White House on Thursday, bringing their message of economic injustice to the capital and posing an opportunity, but also a threat, to President Obama, who presents himself as a fervent defender of the middle class.
Brandishing placards that said ''No More Wall Street White House'' and chanting ''Shame! Shame!'' the crowd took aim at the president, even if it saved most of its vitriol for the nearby headquarters of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce -- or as one banner labeled it, ''Chamber of Corporate Horrors.'' 
To hear some Democratic analysts tell it, the mushrooming protests could be the start of a populist movement on the left that counterbalances the surge of the Tea Party on the right, and closes what some Democrats fear is an ''enthusiasm gap'' between their party and Republicans in the 2012 election.
But that assumes the president is able to win the support of these insurgents, rather than be shunned by them.
Mr. Obama, in a series of recent hard-edged speeches around the country, has channeled many of the grievances of the movement known as Occupy Wall Street: deepening economic inequity, a tax code that gives breaks to the wealthy and corporate interests and banks that profit from hidden consumer fees.
Yet the president also oversaw a bailout of those banks, appointed a Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, who is viewed by the protesters as a shill for Wall Street and pushed a reform of the financial industry that many in the movement condemn as shamefully inadequate in curbing its excesses.
''There's a lot of discontent with Obama's policies,'' said Kevin Zeese, an organizer of the protest, which drew about 500 people. ''Obama is out of touch. He's busy going around the country raising $1 billion to run for re-election.''
At his news conference Thursday, Mr. Obama seemed to recognize the potential and pitfalls of the moment. He sympathized with the frustration of the protesters and criticized Republicans for trying to roll back regulations. But he also defended the bailout and the financial reforms known as Dodd-Frank.
''These days, a lot of folks who are doing the right thing aren't rewarded, and a lot of folks who aren't doing the right thing are rewarded,'' he said. ''And that's going to express itself politically in 2012 and beyond until people feel like once again we're getting back to some old-fashioned American values.''
Even before the protests welled up, Mr. Obama's political advisers said he would focus heavily on the issue of fairness, tapping into a widespread sense among middle class voters that they lost the most in the recession.
Underscoring his more populist tone, Mr. Obama confirmed that he was open to paying for his $450 billion jobs bill by levying a tax surcharge on people with incomes of more than $1 million. The White House had earlier been cool to the proposal, made by Senate Democrats, in favor of taxing a broader group.
Democratic strategists conceded that Occupy Wall Street was a fledgling movement -- it began in New York's financial district last month and has spread to about a dozen other cities -- with a murky future but said they viewed it as a potential boon. The left has not had a popular movement to energize progressive voters for some time, even as the Tea Party has become a vital force in Republican politics.
The decision by organized labor to join the demonstrations has given them an extra jolt of numbers and credibility, since unions have historically played an important, but waning role, in mobilizing voters on the left.
''There's been a lot of talk about how the progressive base is demobilized,'' said Robert Creamer, a longtime organizer for progressive causes. ''Not only do I believe this will inspire the progressive base, the same way that Tunisia inspired Egypt, but President Obama has framed up the issues perfectly.''
Indeed, the placards carried by the protesters -- with messages like ''I am the 99 percent; I don't have a lobbyist'' -- could have been written by the Obama campaign. The president has made much of the widening gulf between the wealthiest Americans and everybody else, as well as a tax code that makes Warren E. Buffett's secretary pay proportionally higher taxes than the billionaire investor himself.
Geoff Garin, a Democratic strategist, said the movement effectively counters Wall Street's argument, echoed by many Republicans, that burdensome regulations lie at the root of the nation's economic problems.
''The coverage the protesters are getting certainly puts a spotlight back on the role Wall Street abuses played, and raises the salience of having a president like Obama who is willing to insist on Wall Street reform,'' he said.
The trouble is, the protesters do not think the president has done nearly enough to crack down on abuses. Several pointed out the lack of prosecutions of investment bankers or others involved in the mortgage-finance industry. Others said the Dodd-Frank legislation did nothing to curb the missteps of banks, while Mr. Obama's economic team, particularly Mr. Geithner, came in for stinging criticism.
''With the people he put in, Goldman Sachs basically occupies the White House,'' said one of the protesters, Bill Brunot, 60, a mechanical engineer from Winchester, Va. ''We got sold out; the banks got bailed out.''
Mr. Brunot said the president could still win back the support of these protesters by changing course, though Mr. Zeese, the organizer, emphasized that the movement did not want to be co-opted by any party.
Jared Bernstein, a liberal economist and former senior adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., said it was inevitable that progressive voters would be disappointed with the Obama administration's track record, given the compromises that presidents have to make to steer major legislation through Congress.
But Mr. Bernstein said the protests were valuable as an indicator of broader sentiment in the country. ''I would advise the administration to think very carefully about the validity of the themes these folks are raising,'' he said, ''because these are themes that resonate well past the folks on Wall Street.''

HEADLINE: Romney Rounds Up Backing Among Key G.O.P. Donors

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE and ASHLEY PARKER

 BODY:
Mitt Romney appeared on Thursday to be rapidly consolidating support among some of the Republican Party's most sought-after uncommitted donors, who have joined Bush administration veterans and other stalwarts of the Republican establishment in backing him as the Republican field settles.
Those who have committed to Mr. Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, include James B. Lee Jr., the vice chairman of JPMorgan Chase, who raised more than $500,000 for Senator John McCain in 2008; Paul Singer, the hedge fund founder and conservative philanthropist; and John A. Catsimatidis, the New York businessman and supermarket magnate. 
''As all Americans would agree, 'It's the economy, stupid,' '' Mr. Catsimatidis said Thursday. ''Romney is smart enough, business-savvy enough, and has common sense to fix the economy.''
All three were among the top supporters of Gov. Christopher J. Christie of New Jersey, whose decision this week to forgo a presidential bid set off a furious lobbying campaign by Mr. Romney and his supporters to lock down Mr. Christie's backers, many of them leading Wall Street figures.
Jim Nicholson, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee and former veterans affairs secretary, will also assist Mr. Romney, as will Ray Washburne, a Dallas real estate and restaurant entrepreneur who was the top fund-raiser for Tim Pawlenty's presidential campaign.
And Mr. Romney has also picked up the support of two Republican financiers who once supported President Obama: Daniel S. Loeb and Clifford S. Asness, both outspoken hedge fund managers who in recent months have sharply criticized the president and his fiscal or regulatory policies.
''Mitt Romney grasps how a free economy works, and doesn't think our current problems come from job-killing A.T.M.'s and evil rich people,'' Mr. Asness wrote Thursday in an e-mail. ''Nor does he think the solution is more stimulus, regulation and class warfare.''
The shift of many establishment donors and officials to Mr. Romney signals the rapid realignment of the Republican field in recent days, with few, if any, other candidates likely to enter the race. The support of these donors -- several fund-raising events are already in the works for the coming weeks -- could prove critical as Mr. Romney seeks to head off a strong challenge by Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, who commands a deep-pocketed network of Republican donors of his own.
Mr. Perry's campaign announced this week that he had raised more than $17 million during his first weeks in the race, a figure that aides to Mr. Romney have said he is unlikely to match. And Mr. Perry, unlike other Republican rivals to Mr. Romney, shows every sign of being able to raise enough money to finance a long primary campaign.
Two of Mr. Pawlenty's former Florida campaign co-chairmen, Justin Sayfie and Slater Bayliss, also endorsed Mr. Romney, his campaign announced Thursday. And Mr. Romney has recruited veterans of George W. Bush's administration for his national security and foreign policy advisory teams. They included Michael Chertoff, the former secretary of homeland security; Michael Hayden, the former head of the National Security Agency and the Central Intelligence Agency; and John Lehman, a former member of the 9/11 Commission.
In an interview on Thursday, Mr. Sayfie said he had been disappointed by Mr. Perry's performance in recent Republican debates and impressed by Mr. Romney's.
''Another factor in my analysis was I want to support a candidate who has the absolute best chance to defeat President Obama in the general election, and in my mind, Gov. Mitt Romney, I think he's the best general election candidate for our party,'' Mr. Sayfie said.
Mr. Perry has rolled out his own endorsements in recent days, many of them state lawmakers, members of Congress and local conservative leaders in states like Florida, Arkansas and New Hampshire. Some major Republican donors and bundlers remain uncommitted, like Kenneth C. Griffin, a Chicago hedge fund manager whom Mr. Romney has courted, and Steven A. Cohen, also a prominent hedge fund manager.
Nor have all of Mr. Christie's supporters migrated to Mr. Romney: Gary Kirke, a businessman who was among a group of Iowa Republicans who traveled to New Jersey this summer to urge Mr. Christie into the race, signed on with Mr. Perry on Tuesday.
Bernard Marcus, a co-founder of Home Depot, is also undecided. A spokeswoman said Mr. Marcus thought that Mr. Romney, Mr. Perry and Herman Cain, the pizza executive, were all ''great candidates.''

HEADLINE: Chief of Gannett Steps Down for Medical Reasons

BYLINE: By TANZINA VEGA

 BODY:
5:03 p.m. Updated Craig A. Dubow, the chairman and chief executive of the Gannett Company, who had been on medical leave, resigned on Thursday for health reasons, the company said. Gracia C. Martore, the company's president and chief operating officer, was named president and chief executive by the Gannett board. 
Ms. Martore, who will also have a seat on the company's board, served as principal executive officer during Mr. Dubow's leave. Gannett, the country's largest newspaper publisher by circulation, also announced the appointment of Marjorie Magner as nonexecutive chairman. Ms. Magner, who was the chairwoman of Gannett's audit committee, is also a managing partner at the private equity firm.
Gannett, like many other newspaper companies, has struggled in recent years as declines in advertising, especially for classified listings, have become commonplace. The company's shares have dropped about 16 percent in the last year, but were essentially flat on Thursday, at $10.45.
''All of us have had to live through an economy over the last few years, especially 2008 and 2009, that has been the most difficult and challenging economy in the last 80 years,'' Ms. Martore said. ''The great thing about the Gannett Company is that we have 100-plus great brands in local communities that we serve day in and day out.'' Ms. Martore said the company would continue to focus on its digital strategy, which she said accounted for 21 percent of the company's total revenue. ''We're going to be on every platform that the consumer wants to access that information on,'' she said.
Ms. Martore cited the company's effort to start a daily deal site, called DealChicken.com, as an example of the types of new digital initiatives that could attract local users and advertisers.
''We already have great relationships with advertisers and marketers in those communities that may want to use those services,'' she said.
In June, citing weak advertising revenue, the company announced that it would eliminate 700 jobs in its Community Publishing division, laying off 3 percent of its employees working at newspapers like The Courier-Journal of Louisville, The Cincinnati Enquirer and The Indianapolis Star.
In 2010, the company's flagship newspaper, USA Today, also had about 35 layoffs in its newsroom because of weak advertising revenue.
Ms Martore would not comment on whether Gannett would be forced to lay off more workers in the near future, adding that it was still ''a little too early to handicap where the economy will be for 2012.''
In a statement, Mr. Dubow said: ''I am extremely proud of where we are today as a company. We have always maintained an unwavering focus on the consumer. As a result, we have evolved into a digitally led media and marketing solutions company committed to delivering trusted news and information anywhere, anytime.''
Mr. Dubow, who had been with Gannett for 30 years, added that he believed ''the company's best days lie ahead.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Moving On, Minus Its Genius; Bringing the Apple Magic to Television Remains an Alluring Challenge

BYLINE: By NICK WINGFIELD and AMY CHOZICK

 BODY:
Heard of Apple TV? A lot of people have not. That is because even though Steven P. Jobs helped upend so many businesses with a string of groundbreaking products in music, mobile phones, games and tablet computers, he barely made a dent in television.
Under Mr. Jobs, Apple dipped its toe only slightly into the television business with Apple TV, a set-top box for accessing Internet video. That product has been one of the rare disappointments in its lineup, especially when compared with smashes like the iPhone and iPad. 
But many in the tech industry contend that television is ripe for technological makeover, and that the next big challenge for Apple, after the death of Mr. Jobs, is likely to be in that area.
''It's the big area they haven't colonized,'' said James McQuivey, an analyst at Forrester Research. ''It's the thing we spend more of our time on than sleep.''
In the meantime, companies like Microsoft have started to take a stronger leadership role in helping to push the technology of television forward, as Apple did in areas like music and mobile phones.
Television is such a tantalizing target in part because people spend so many hours watching it, but also because the industry over all has been slow to innovate except perhaps in making screens larger. In particular, the consuming public is still waiting for television content -- everything that people watch -- to be delivered over the Internet in a convenient, affordable package on all the devices people are now using.
One big reason for Apple's failure to gain traction in television is that Apple TV has not had a compelling source of television and movie content that allows the product to stand out. Although the company's iTunes store is stocked with many popular shows like ''Glee'' and ''Sons of Anarchy,'' network and movie studio executives have hesitated to make all of their content widely available at attractive prices, in large part over concerns about angering cable companies, a big source of their revenue, and their pipeline into living rooms.
In August, Apple discontinued an iTunes rental service that allowed viewers to rent television episodes for 99 cents through the store for watching on devices like Apple TV, saying that consumers were not as interested in renting episodes as in buying them.
Last year, talks between Apple and television executives, including NBCUniversal, Viacom and Discovery, stalled over a plan to license their programs for an Internet subscription service akin to Netflix and Hulu Plus, according to executives briefed on talks.
The cold shoulder to Apple from television executives is a stark contrast to the success Mr. Jobs had in wooing the music companies when the iTunes Store was begun eight years ago. At the time, Mr. Jobs used his personal charisma to persuade record executives to let Apple sell songs for 99 cents each through iTunes. It also helped him that the iPod hadn't yet turned into a blockbuster product.
The subsequent explosion in sales of 99-cent digital singles on iTunes further eroded compact disc sales, many music executives say. Television executives were determined to avoid the same experience. ''It didn't work in TV and movies precisely because it did in music,'' said Mr. McQuivey of Forrester Research.
Mr. Jobs himself often downplayed Apple TV's impact on the market. While he used lofty words like ''magical'' to describe the iPad, Mr. Jobs on more than one occasion referred to the $99 Apple TV as a ''hobby'' for Apple because of its lackluster sales. Analysts estimate the company has sold about two million of the devices. It has sold nearly 29 million iPads since the product was introduced in the spring of 2010.
In an on-stage interview last year at the D: All Things Digital conference, Mr. Jobs further expounded on his pessimism about the market by saying that it was hard to sell innovative television devices like Apple TV to consumers, when cable companies give their customers a set-top box for little or no cost upfront. ''That pretty much squashes any opportunity for innovation because nobody's willing to buy a set-top box,'' he said.
In the meantime, one of Apple's rivals, Microsoft, announced a major new push into the television business on Wednesday, before the announcement of Mr. Jobs's death. The company said it was entering a partnership with nearly 40 television providers, including Bravo, Comcast, HBO and Verizon FiOS, that will allow the 35 million members of its Xbox Live online service to watch mainstream cable programming through Microsoft's game console.
The one big catch is that Xbox users will still need to pay their regular monthly television bills to their cable providers to watch the television programming on their game consoles. But executives contend that the partnership could still make viewers happy because the Xbox is so much friendlier to use than a cable programming guide when searching for things to watch.
Even if Apple TV has not worked yet, Apple is still having an impact on television watching through its mobile devices. After the Winter Olympics in Vancouver last year NBCUniversal studied how viewers watched the games. Network researchers noticed a fundamentally different way users of iPhones watched; they preferred easily accessible clips and highlights, rather than long, elaborately produced broadcasts. That behavior has since expanded to iPad users and affected the way networks deliver live events.
''Every one of those devices very, very quickly went mainstream,'' said Alan Wurtzel, president of research and media development for NBCUniversal.
The exception was Apple TV, which Mr. Wurtzel says was ''a year or two ahead of its time.''
''Apple TV will be among the major players in that world, except, I want to be clear, from a business standpoint there could be others to take on that role whether it's Amazon or Netflix,'' Mr. Wurtzel said.
Apple TV, while still niche, has fared better than others like Google TV, said Michael Gartenberg, research director overseeing consumer technology at Gartner Inc. ''We see a lot of experimentation in the TV space and they'll eventually get it right,'' he said.
Part of the problem for Apple is that a television is not just another screen in the home. Viewers have a personal relationship with television. Networks view it as the last place to preserve their right to present shows on a given night and charge advertisers a premium. ''It's not a question of kinks in terms of getting the technology to work but working to get the content,'' Mr. Gartenberg said.

HEADLINE: Putin Wants Trade Bloc To Decide On Russia

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER

 BODY:
MOSCOW -- Russia's principal trading partners should decide soon whether to admit Russia to the World Trade Organization, Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin said Thursday in his first direct address to investors after announcing that he would run again for president next year.
Russia's membership application to the trade group has been pending now for 18 years. But this week, officials in both the United States and Russia suggested that Russia, which is by far the largest economy still outside the W.T.O., was close to membership. 
One remaining obstacle is a demand by Georgia, a member of the organization, that international monitors be positioned at customs clearance points between Russia and two separatist regions, Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Russia, which largely controls the regions but officially considers them independent nations, has rejected monitors.
Because accepting new nations in the W.T.O. is generally decided by consensus among the members, now numbering 153 states, Georgia has wound up with exceptional leverage.
Russia has been applying to join the organization since 1993, when the group was called the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. But a series of disputes over airplane tariffs, international trade in chickens and allegations that Russia has allowed flagrant abuse of intellectual property rights has repeatedly blocked its membership. Russia's W.T.O. negotiators appear to have removed most of the remaining obstacles to accession, it emerged this week, including differences on meat imports, sanitary standards and incentives to Russian automobile producers. The World Bank says Russia's economy will benefit by joining, as will companies that export goods to Russia, like Procter & Gamble or John Deere.
''I have a legitimate question,'' Mr. Putin said in remarks at an economic forum in Moscow called Russia Calling!, sponsored by the state bank VTB.
''Do our main partners in Europe and the United States want Russia to become a W.T.O. member or not?'' he asked. ''There is no need to take refuge in the Georgia issue. If they want, they can have this very quickly, especially considering that we have reached a compromise on most issues.'' In the speech, Mr. Putin said he did not expect the global economy to dip into a second recession, something that could disproportionately affect Russia because of its dependence on oil exports.
In a comment apparently intended to ease the financial community's concerns about investing in Russia, Mr. Putin said that the widely admired former finance minister, Aleksei L. Kudrin, who was fired last month, would remain a ''member of our team.'' He said, ''We will be working with him,'' without specifying any position he might have.
Igor I. Shuvalov, a Russian deputy prime minister, said Tuesday after a visit to Washington that American trade negotiators were now advocating Russia's membership with other nations. They are working ''24 hours a day'' to persuade other W.T.O. members to accept Russia's application, he said. The nearly two-decade-long process, he said, is ''very close'' to completion.
But Mr. Putin said that the United States and Europe had asked Russia to negotiate a settlement with Georgia. Mr. Putin said the countries were no closer to a compromise today than when talks began in March.
The trade organization negotiations have taken on some added significance as a gauge of how the world will react to Mr. Putin's decision, announced late last month, to seek another term as president. Mr. Putin's comments suggested he expected the United States and Europe to pressure Georgia to accede to Russian membership in the organization.
Georgia's president, Mikheil Saakashvili, has said it is in his country's interest for Russia to join the W.T.O., but he has not backed away from the border monitoring demand. Once Russia becomes a member, Georgia can sue Russia in the organization's courts for banning imports of Georgian vegetables, wine and mineral water, long a source of contention between the two sides.

HEADLINE: Senate Nears Approval of Measure to Punish China Over Currency Manipulation

BYLINE: By ERIC LICHTBLAU

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- In one of Capitol Hill's longest running battles, opponents of China's trade policies have used threats, negotiation, protests from small American businesses and even the occasional Peking duck dinner in a failed effort to stop China from manipulating its currency.
After eight years, that campaign is on the verge of a breakthrough, as the Senate appeared ready Thursday to approve a get-tough approach that had stalled numerous times before: a bill to punish China with high tariffs on some exports if it fails to adopt a market-driven exchange rate. 
Economists say China's artificially cheap currency has cost the United States jobs and billions in lost trade. But opponents of tariffs, including major manufacturers doing business in China, warn that penalizing China could start a trade war that would hurt American businesses even more.
''We're already in a trade war,'' Senator Charles E. Schumer, the New York Democrat who has led the push for tariffs, said in an interview. ''We can't afford to just do nothing. This is a message to China that the jig is finally up.''
The American jobless problem have combined to give the tariff proposal newfound momentum, as the Senate spent much of the afternoon Thursday debating it.
Supporters, casting the measure as a way to spur job growth, were confident the Senate would approve it. Even the measure's fiercest opponents were grudgingly predicting passage in the Senate, and probably the House.
But 11-hour resistance by leading Republicans has clouded the outcome in the House, where the speaker, John A. Boehner, this week called the tariff plan ''dangerous,'' and it is unclear if the issue will even come up for a House vote.
China itself voiced strong objections this week and charged that meddling by the United States in Chinese currency violated world trade protocols. The Chinese Embassy has retained one of Washington's most powerful lobbying shops, Patton Boggs, to represent its interests for $420,000 a year.
Lobbyists for General Motors, Caterpillar, steel producers, textile manufacturers, toy makers, poultry farmers and other businesses have also weighed in, supporting or opposing the tariffs depending on their own business relations with China.
Generally, large manufacturers like Caterpillar that operate in China have opposed it, warning of a backlash. Smaller businesses, like a tube maker in Ohio or a ceramics maker in upstate New York, have supported tariffs because they say China has artificially lowered its prices and gained an unfair edge.
While the Chinese renminbi has risen 6 percent against the dollar since China loosened currency controls last year, economists say it is still vastly undervalued. Meanwhile, China's trade surplus with the United States stands at $273 billion -- more than triple the gap a decade earlier.
In Senate testimony this week, the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, went so far as to link China's undervaluing of its currency to the slow economic recovery worldwide.
''The Chinese currency policy is blocking that process,'' Mr. Bernanke testified. ''And so it is to some extent hurting the recovery process.''
The Obama administration, however, has been noncommittal about the tariff proposal.
At a news conference on Thursday, President Obama would not say whether he would veto the bill it if it passed, but he raised concerns.
On the one hand, he said, ''China has been very aggressive in gaming the trading system to its advantage,'' and ''it is indisputable that they intervene heavily in the currency markets.''
But he cautioned that he did not want to see the World Trade Organization strike down any steps the United States might take. ''Then suddenly U.S. companies are subject to a whole bunch of sanctions,'' Mr. Obama said.
Both supporters and opponents of the tariffs see the outcome as hugely significant financially and politically.
That was evident this week when the Club for Growth, a conservative free-market advocate that has led opposition to the bill, warned lawmakers that a vote supporting tariffs ''will count heavily as an antigrowth action'' on the group's Congressional ''scorecard,'' which helps determine the group's level of support.
Club for Growth's political muscle is already being felt. In the House, 99 Republicans supported a tariff plan last year. But after the club intensified its opposition, Representative Tim Ryan, an Ohio Democrat who favors tariffs, complained this week that ''all of a sudden you can't get a lick of Republican support.''
Early in the week, Chris Chocola, a former congressman who leads the Club for Growth, was pessimistic about chances of stopping the bill.
''It's not politically expedient to defend China, so you won't find many who will do that in words or deeds,'' he said.
By midweek, after sharply critical remarks from Mr. Boehner on Tuesday, Mr. Chocola's outlook had brightened.
''I give Boehner a lot of credit,'' he said. ''He clearly doesn't want to bring it to the floor. And we're trying to do everything we can to prevent it from getting to the floor.''
The maneuvering reflected the stops and starts on the issue as a whole since 2003, when Mr. Schumer and Senator Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina Republican, first proposed a 27.5 percent tariff on Chinese goods.
The two senators visited China in 2005 to press economic officials there to allow their currency to rise to market rates. They were greeted with a high-level banquet at the Great Hall of the People -- Mr. Schumer pronounced the Chinese dishes ''extraordinary'' -- and by China's assurances that it would begin liberalizing monetary policies and allowing market forces to determine values.
The United States saw some early signs of improvement, but progress stalled. The Bush administration, after avoiding confrontations with China for years on the issue, took it to the World Trade Organization in 2007 over trade barriers.
The United States imposed tariffs on Chinese tires in 2009, and China followed the next year with steep tariffs on American poultry imports. Tariff opponents see the tit-for-tat as a small-scale version of the kind of trade wars they predict will break out en masse if the current plan becomes law.
''Every time we engage in protectionist behavior,'' Mr. Chocola said, ''bad things happen.''

HEADLINE: 200 Chinese Subsidies Violate Rules, U.S. Says

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
Under pressure from Congress to do more to confront China on economic issues, the Obama administration has notified the World Trade Organization of nearly 200 Chinese subsidy programs, saying many of them may violate free trade rules.
Ron Kirk, the United States trade representative, said in a statement on Thursday that many of the subsidies had been identified in a yearlong American inquiry into how the Chinese government helped bankroll the rapid growth of its clean energy industries. In solar and wind power, in particular, American companies have had trouble keeping up with Chinese competitors.
The action by Mr. Kirk's office comes as the Senate is considering a bill challenging China's manipulation of its currency as a trade tool. The Chinese government strongly condemned that bill, and House Republicans and the White House have also expressed reservations. 
But with the trade representative's long list of ways that China subsidizes its domestic industries, the Obama administration is now taking a more head-on approach to Chinese trade. Whether or not any of those subsidies violate international trade rules, the American trade office says China is already out of bounds by not having reported them to the W.T.O. The W.T.O. requires member countries to disclose details of their subsidies every two years. But China has disclosed its subsidies only once since it joined the W.T.O. in 2001.
The goal of requiring the reports was to help other countries study the subsidies and determine whether any of them violated trade rules that prohibit using government money either to help companies buy market share in other countries or to discourage imports.
The only time China filed a report was in 2006, and it was a short list that included only subsidies at the national level -- not China's numerous provincial or municipal subsidies.
Notifying the W.T.O. about China's undisclosed subsidies would not set off any automatic moves to consider sanctions. In fact, China already agreed in recent years to repeal or let lapse about half of the subsidies on the administration's list in efforts to resolve parts of other trade disputes.
But of the subsidies still in place, about half have been identified as part of a yearlong American investigation into how the Chinese government has helped bankroll the rapid growth of its clean energy industries.
Through various types of support, China has helped transform its wind turbine and solar panel manufacturers from also-rans into the world's dominant producers in just five years. The American solar panel industry has been crumbling in the face of plunging prices forced by Chinese exports, with three companies -- Solyndra, Evergreeen Solar and SpectraWatt -- filing for bankruptcy in August alone.
Solyndra's collapse has generated its own controversy within the United States, with critics saying the Obama administration made a bad bet in providing $527 million in federal loan guarantees to the company.
One of the largest non-Chinese survivors in the solar industry, SolarWorld, blamed Chinese subsidies in part for the closing last week of a 186-employee factory in Camarillo, Calif.
''Pervasive and all-encompassing Chinese subsidies are decimating our industry,'' said Ben Santarris, a spokesman for SolarWorld, which is based in Germany but has more than 1,100 employees in the United States, even after the Camarillo closing. SolarWorld has been talking with American officials, trade lawyers and competitors on how to respond to the Chinese subsidies, Mr. Santarris said.
Commerce ministry officials in China have repeatedly denied that the country's subsidies for clean energy industries violated W.T.O. rules. The commerce ministry was closed this week for national holidays.
In examining China's clean energy subsidies over the last year, the Obama administration has already filed one complaint to the W.T.O. That filing involved a subsidy by Beijing of $6.7 million to $22.5 million for each wind turbine manufacturer that used parts made in China instead of imported parts. China agreed last June to revoke the subsidy.
But wind industry analysts have described that subsidy as only one of many, and not especially vital to the Chinese industry's financial strength.
American officials have repeatedly declined to say whether the clean energy investigation might lead to further filings at the W.T.O. But American officials had called in June for China to disclose its subsidies when they reached the deal on the Chinese wind turbine parts. And Mr. Kirk was even more critical on Thursday, calling China's lack of disclosure ''intolerable.''
''Every member of the W.T.O. is required to come clean on its subsidy programs on a regular basis,'' Mr. Kirk said. ''China has not notified its subsidy programs in over five years.''
A Chinese government adviser on trade policy said in an interview last winter that Beijing officials were working to prepare an updated notification of subsidies to the W.T.O. But he said preparing such a list was difficult because there were many different national, provincial and local agencies that all might provide subsidies. The adviser insisted on anonymity because he was not authorized to speak on behalf of the commerce ministry.
The American trade representative's office also notified the W.T.O. on Thursday of 50 national and state government subsidy programs in India that it said should have been disclosed by the authorities there.

HEADLINE: Charging for Debit Cards Is Robbery

BYLINE: By LLOYD CONSTANTINE. 
Lloyd Constantine, a commercial litigator, is the author of ''Priceless: The Case That Brought Down the Visa/MasterCard Bank Cartel.''

 BODY:
WHEN Bank of America told its customers recently that it would start charging them $5 a month to use debit cards, it argued that it was forced to make that change because of regulations that altered the economics of the cards. Other banks agreed. The chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, Jamie Dimon, put the effects of the regulations this way: ''If you're a restaurant and you can't charge for the soda, you're going to charge more for the burger.'' Both banks were responding to the Federal Reserve's actions to limit the interchange fees banks charge stores each time a debit card is used for a purchase.
But the banks' simplistic statements are merely an attempt to rationalize and obfuscate one of the largest illegal transfers of wealth from consumers to banks in American history. 
Debit cards were developed by banks as a replacement for paper checks. When a consumer pays with a debit card instead of a check, the bank saves money. In the 1980s, Visa calculated the savings at 55 cents to $1.60 per check. The savings is much higher today. For decades, Bank of America, the founding owner and member of Visa (originally called BankAmericard) and all of the Visa and MasterCard banks, including Chase, hid the identity of their debit cards from stores by designing them to look and function like their signature authorized credit cards and by charging stores the same price for debit and credit transactions. Banks did this despite the fact that purchases made with a debit card didn't involve a loan from the bank, posed very little fraud risk and were extravagantly profitable to banks because they eliminated the costs of processing and clearing checks.
The practice of deceiving stores and forcing them to accept overpriced debit transactions was challenged in a 1996 antitrust lawsuit against Visa and MasterCard, in which I was the lead attorney for the plaintiffs. In 2003, that resulted in a $3.4 billion settlement to stores, a court order to redesign the debit cards and a reduction in the price banks charge stores for common debit transactions -- to an average of 42 cents per transaction from an average of 63 cents.
However, that lower price was still much too high, as the Federal Reserve well knew. The Fed had been established in 1913 in large measure to end the then widespread practice of banks' charging a similar ''interchange'' fee for the use of paper checks. Those check interchange fees were slowing the growth of interstate commerce, and the Fed quickly prohibited them. The interchange fees that banks now charge stores for debit transactions are economically and functionally identical to the check interchange fees prohibited by the Fed almost a century ago.
When A.T.M. cards were first used at stores as point-of-sale debit cards, no interchange fees were charged. In many instances debit card networks like Shazam and Tyme actually paid stores to accept debit transactions. They did this so banks, which owned the networks, could reap the huge profits of eliminating checks. But Bank of America, Chase and their Visa/MasterCard partners wanted to have their burgers and eat them, too. They instituted the illegal practices challenged and eliminated in the Visa Check antitrust litigation. Later, the Dodd-Frank Act directed the Fed to continue the process of addressing high and anticompetitive debit interchange fees by examining whether the banks could justify those fees on the basis of the costs banks incurred in processing debit card transactions. After initially deciding that debit interchange fees should be lowered from 44 cents to 7 to 12 cents, the Fed, in yet another huge handout to big banks, revised the fee range to 21 to 24 cents.
That is the change in economics which Bank of America cites as it attempts to begin charging a large new fee to its debit cardholders. It's a free country, but also one where competition is supposed to prevail and prevent companies, including banks, from simply raising the price of their burgers without suffering the competitive consequences. Recently, Netflix learned that a company can't adopt a big price increase without suffering the consequences. When it tried to, it lost hundreds of thousands of its customers.
Retail customers of Bank of America and of any other bank that follows its lead should swiftly move their business. I am certain that other banks will welcome the competitive opportunity that Bank of America has given them with its arrogant and disingenuous action and justification.

HEADLINE: A Charter Push in Middle-Class Brooklyn

BYLINE: By FERNANDA SANTOS

 BODY:
Fresh from a bruising battle to open a charter school on the Upper West Side, Eva S. Moskowitz, the former city councilwoman who runs a network of charters in New York City, is gearing up to expand into middle-class areas by opening a school in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, next fall.
The city has begun reaching out to neighborhood residents and leaders, continuing its push to turn charter schools into viable options for middle-class families whose neighborhood schools are too crowded or too weak to be attractive. 
It is a pre-emptive move to keep some of those families from trading public for private schools or leaving New York City altogether, lured by the quality and stability of suburban school districts, city officials said.
The new school, to be named Success Academy Cobble Hill, is one of three schools Ms. Moskowitz plans to open in Brooklyn next year. The others would be in Bedford-Stuyvesant, where her network, Success Academies, already has a presence, and in a gentrifying section of Williamsburg, where it was enticed by a group of parents of young children who live there.
The schools, eventually to serve students from kindergarten through eighth grade, would share space with existing public schools, opening the doors for new fights against placing charter schools in buildings already occupied by traditional public schools.
The dispute over Ms. Moskowitz's Upper West Success Academy was lengthy and costly, culminating in an unsuccessful lawsuit to try to keep the school from opening. It welcomed its first students on Aug. 24, two weeks ahead of the four high schools with which it shares a building.
Ms. Moskowitz said she expected some protests against the Cobble Hill school but was ready to use the same counteroffensive strategies she deployed on the Upper West Side, hosting house parties and other mixers to win over parents.
''There's a deep anticharter sentiment out there, and I'm sure there will be opposition coming from that corner,'' Ms. Moskowitz said. ''But if you're a parent with kids, you need a school, you've got to find an option. You can't wait six months into the school year to find a spot for your child in kindergarten.''
Cobble Hill is similar to the Upper West Side in several ways. It is diverse in ethnic and economic terms, but its core is solidly well-to-do and primarily white. The school district it is in, District 15, has a small number of sought-after elementary schools whose buildings are near or over capacity, but, according to the most recent city statistics, most other schools have room to spare.
Public School 29 is 70 seats short of reaching its limit of 750 students, and its kindergarten enrollment went up by roughly 50 percent between the 2006-7 and 2010-11 school years. At P.S. 58 nearby, the number of kindergartners grew by 70 percent in the same period, in a building that is now operating at 110 percent capacity, data show.
''Kindergarten enrollment in this neighborhood has grown significantly over the last five years, so we want to take the proactive step of proposing a new, excellent elementary school for this community,'' Marc Sternberg, the Education Department's deputy schools chancellor for portfolio planning, said in a statement. ''The Success Charter Network is an organization with a strong track record, and we anticipate that there will be great interest in this school in the community.''
Generally, the Education Department looks to place new schools in buildings that have at least 300 available seats, and at least two buildings in the area fit the bill. The building shared by the Math and Science Exploratory School and Brooklyn High School of the Arts has 654 open seats; the one that houses Brooklyn School for Global Studies and the School for International Studies has 690 seats available.
The department has not decided where to put the new charter schools, a spokeswoman said.
Jenny Sedlis, a director at Ms. Moskowitz's organization, said the schools' admissions criteria had not been set, but for the Cobble Hill school, at least, the goal is to give preference to children who live in the district.
She said the school there would open with 190 kindergarten and first-grade seats, accommodating some 600 students once all grades have been introduced.

HEADLINE: Escape Route For Greece, With Perils

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
Greece would be in much better shape now if it had never joined the euro zone, or if it had been kicked out in 2004 when it admitted that it had lied about its finances to join the club. So would the rest of Europe.
So why not get out now?
One answer is the same one that was given when Greece's cheating was revealed: Legally, there is no way out. The euro was designed to be the Roach Motel of currencies. Once you enter, you can never leave. There is no provision for departure.
But, of course, there is a way out. It would be messy, and perhaps disastrous. But no one is going to send an army to Athens to force it to keep the euro. 
If Greece were to follow the example set by Argentina nearly a decade ago, it would simply convert its debts from euros into its old currency, the drachma, at the old exchange rate of 340.75 drachmas to one euro. It could also convert euro currency in the country at the same rate. So if you owned one million euros in Greek bonds, they would be converted to bonds with a face value of 340.75 million drachmas.
With a printing press available, Greece could meet those obligations. Of course the drachma would soon be worth a lot less -- perhaps 1,000 to the euro. So bondholders would have lost two-thirds of face value. Greece might do O.K., but for reasons we will see, the move could be devastating to the rest of Europe.
In 2002, Argentina's currency, the peso, was officially tied to the dollar at a one-to-one parity. There was a ''currency board'' that was supposed to assure the tie could never be broken, and it had worked for a decade. But Argentine inflation had outpaced that of the United States, and the peso was seriously overvalued.
In early 2002, a new Argentine government ended the peg and did much more. It defaulted, and it required its citizens to do the same. If you had a dollar deposit in an Argentine bank, it became a peso deposit, soon to be worth about 30 United States cents to the peso. That was true regardless of who owned the bank. If you wanted to get dollars back from your Citibank deposit in Buenos Aires, you were out of luck.
Argentina was cut off from international credit. Imports plunged and the country entered a deep -- but relatively brief -- recession. The peso lost two-thirds of its value within a few months. Argentina was sued by everyone in sight.
But devaluation worked, as it often does. Argentine exports became competitive thanks to lower costs, and the economy rebounded. There are international judgments still outstanding against the country, but when it comes to sovereign states it can be easier to get judgments than to collect on them. Diplomatic assets are off limits -- no one can grab the Argentine Embassy in Washington -- and monetary assets can be kept with the Bank for International Settlements in Switzerland, which will not allow them to be seized.
Argentina's decision to abrogate private contracts was a crucial part of the package, said John Hempton, an Australian hedge fund manager who has studied what happened. ''The Argentine banks all had lots of U.S. dollar funding,'' he said. If they had to repay those dollars, while their assets were devalued, ''then they would all have uncontrolled defaults, a true disaster, and the country would lose its institutions.''
The Argentine experience was not pretty, but it may well be more attractive than the seemingly endless rounds of austerity, strikes and missed fiscal targets that seem to be leaving the Greek economy in a permanent recession. From the Greek perspective, the course could seem attractive.
There are some important differences, of course. Argentina had a currency that still existed, and there were peso notes. There are no drachma notes floating around Athens or anywhere else. If the drachma suddenly became the legal currency again, currency would be needed. Printing new notes in secret would be a challenge.
Would the bond switch be legal? For some bonds, clearly it would not be. British courts ''would enter judgments saying Greece owes x billion euros,'' said Whitney Debevoise, a lawyer with Arnold & Porter, ''but would then have to find assets.''
But British courts would have jurisdiction only over the minority of bonds issued under British law. Most Greek bonds were issued under Greek law, and presumably Greece can change that law to legalize what it does. Greek bonds already trade for less than 40 percent of face value, so it is possible that their actual value might not decline all that much, assuming investors believed the drachmas would be repaid.
Greece would suddenly be forced to run a balanced budget, or to borrow from its own citizens, whose savings would have lost much, if not most, of their value.
For Greece to pull that off, it would probably have to do it over a weekend, without leaks of what it was planning. If people got wind of what might be coming, there would be an immediate run on Greek banks.
When Argentina did it, there was no immediate ripple effect. But in Europe the result would very likely be explosive. There would be a run on banks in peripheral countries. If Greece can do it, what about Portugal, or Spain, or Italy?
Mr. Hempton has a vision of what rational people in the peripheral countries would do as soon as they heard about the Greek move. ''Max all your credit cards for cash, draw all your bank deposits'' and drive to somewhere safe. Money would pour into banks in Germany.
Or maybe not. German banks would have a lot of assets that were suddenly worth less, particularly if other countries did follow Greece. Owing euros to depositors, and getting devalued drachmas, or lire, or escudos, or pesetas from borrowers is one way to make capital vanish.
None of this is made any easier by the fact that in the old days to have a run on a bank you needed to show up at an office during banking hours. When the Austro-Hungarian empire collapsed after World War I, countries stamped the old currency to convert it into their currencies and stopped people at borders to search for cash. Now we live in a world of wired money. Most money is not in bills or coins but in bank deposits that can be moved halfway around the world nearly instantly. Border guards might not be much help.
In other words, Greece would fare poorly if it tried the Argentine strategy, but would have hope for recovery. But it might be impossible to halt the crisis for the rest of Europe.
Which brings us back to what is going on now.
European leaders hold meetings -- this week in Luxembourg, next month in Cannes -- at which they say they are determined to deal with the problem but seem to be unable to do much. The July 21 agreement for a new bailout of Greece is nearing ratification by all the euro area governments but seems woefully out of date. Greece's fiscal situation is growing worse, so it cannot meet its deficit targets. Some politicians want banks to take bigger losses than the July deal envisaged, but bank regulators are afraid of what would happen as a result. Greece remains woefully uncompetitive in export markets, and there is no credible plan to get its economy growing. The rest of Europe uses the threat of cutting off funds to force more and more austerity on the Greek government.
Many Greek citizens are acting as if there really is no need for all that austerity. There was a one-day general strike on Wednesday, with 20,000 marchers reported on the streets of Athens. The tax collectors, of all people, have staged job actions because they fear being laid off. To say the least, there is no sign of a national spirit of sacrifice to save the country.
The message from Greece now may be summarized as, ''I'm small. I've suffered. You can afford to rescue me. If you don't, I can create chaos for all of you.''
They may be right.

HEADLINE: Moving On, Minus Its Genius: Defending Life's Work With Words Of a Tyrant

BYLINE: By DAVID STREITFELD

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO -- The first time Steve Jobs ever bullied anyone was in the third grade. He and some pals ''basically destroyed'' the teacher, he once said.
For the next half-century, Mr. Jobs never let up. He chewed out subordinates and partners who failed to deliver, trashed competitors who did not measure up and told know-it-all pundits to take a hike. He had a vision of greatness that he wielded to reshape the computer, telephone and entertainment industries, and he would brook no compromise.
Maybe it is only the despair people feel about the stagnating American economy, but the announcement of the death of the Apple cofounder Wednesday seemed to mark the end of something: in an era of limits, Mr. Jobs was the last great tyrant. 
Even in Silicon Valley, where corporate chieftains are frequently larger than life, and soul-enhancing technology is promised with the morning e-mail, there was no one quite like him. He used his powers to make devices that are beloved by their owners in a way that very few American products manage to achieve, especially these days.
''Amidst the oceans of enforced mediocrity in the bland, deflavorized culture of managed-by-committee corporate behemoths,'' the entrepreneur Perry Metzger posted on his Google+ page, Mr. Jobs ''showed that the real path to excellence was excellence -- that you could do great things by, who would have imagined, being smart and having excellent taste and not ever settling for second best.''
After his death became public, there was a waterfall of emotion on Twitter and blogs. Fans gathered outside Mr. Jobs's house in Palo Alto, Calif., and they placed candles and flowers in front of Apple stores everywhere. His house is in the center of town, easy to find and rather modest for a guy worth about $6.5 billion. He was planning another house, but even that seemed like it would be relatively restrained for a lord of Silicon Valley.
Where he was unrestrained was in his work. Stories of him forcefully telling Apple employees that a product was not good enough are legion. (''You've baked a really lovely cake,'' he told one engineer, adding that the hapless fellow had used dog feces for frosting). Make it smaller and better, he commanded. No element of design was too minor to escape his notice. (On a Mac interface: ''We made the buttons on the screen look so good you'll want to lick them.'')
Mr. Jobs castigated competitors, particularly Microsoft. Bill Gates's company, which dwarfed Apple in power and wealth during the 1980s and 1990s, was not even described as second rate; it was deemed third-rate. Worse, it was not even trying.
''The only problem with Microsoft is they just have no taste,'' Mr. Jobs said in a typical broadside. ''They have absolutely no taste. And I don't mean that in a small way, I mean that in a big way, in the sense that they don't think of original ideas, and they don't bring much culture into their products.''
This is not the sort of unvarnished comment you ever hear the founders of Google, say, publicly expressing about Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, or vice versa. ''We're mourning Steve because we don't have much of his passion and directness in corporate life these days,'' said Jay Elliot, a former Apple executive who has written a book about learning from Mr. Jobs's lessons in leadership. ''He wasn't driven by the stock price.''
Like many big tech companies, Apple has a formidable public relations staff, but Mr. Jobs was not constrained by this either. People knew his e-mail -- ''sjobs@apple.com'' -- and sent him queries and complaints. He often responded, if tersely. A persistent effort by a college student complaining about her inability to get information from the famously reticent P.R. staff finally elicited a testy ''please leave us alone.''
Mr. Jobs's self-confidence could sometimes be indistinguishable from arrogance and self-aggrandizement. At an Apple Halloween party during the wild early years, he reportedly came dressed as Jesus. (In a rare tribute for a lay person, Mr. Jobs's career was celebrated Thursday on the front page of the Vatican newspaper.) But it was an arrogance tempered by faith in the power of technology to improve lives.
The satirical newspaper The Onion underscored this point nicely in its news story on Mr. Jobs's death. The headline, modified here to replace an expletive, said: ''Last American Who Knew What the Heck He Was Doing Dies.''
Funny, but it is deep in the nature of Silicon Valley to challenge such sentiments. ''I don't want to take anything away from the guy, he was brilliant and uncompromising and wonderful, but there's a level of adulation that goes beyond what is merited,'' said Tim O'Reilly, chief executive of the tech publisher O'Reilly Media. ''There will be revolutions and revolutionaries to come.''

HEADLINE: Some Unemployed Find Fault In Extension of Jobless Benefits

BYLINE: By SHAILA DEWAN

 BODY:
Dan Tolleson, a researcher and writer with a Ph.D. in politics, has been out of work since 2009, except for brief stints as a driver. Still, he opposes President Obama's call for Congress to renew extensions on unemployment benefits.
''They're going to end up spending more money on unemployment benefits, while less money is coming in on tax returns,'' he said, suggesting that the government should focus on measures that might encourage businesses to hire. ''Far better to relax some of these outrageous regulations.''
Make no mistake -- Mr. Tolleson, 54, has collected unemployment checks, saying he had little choice. But his objection to a policy that would probably benefit him shows just how divisive the question has become of providing a bigger safety net to the long-term jobless, a common strategy in recessions.
President Obama wants to continue offering benefits for an extended period of time, a maximum of 99 weeks, as is now the case. The measure is part of his jobs bill, which he once again called on Congress to pass in a press conference on Thursday. 
If the extension is not renewed, benefits for more than 2.2 million people will be curtailed by mid-February, according to the Department of Labor. The Obama administration estimates that with no extensions, a total of six million people will run out of benefits over the course of next year.
Unless job growth picks up sharply, many of those people will struggle to stay out of poverty. Unemployment benefits, which average $298 a week, help families and serve as economic stimulus because most of the money gets spent right away on basics. Liberal and many centrist economists say that the economy is too weak now to withstand the shock of a sharp drop in those payments.
Still, conservatives contend that extending benefits pulls money from other parts of the economy, discourages people from finding work and increases the unemployment rate. Some Republican politicians have gone so far as to suggest that people living on unemployment are simply lazy. Even President Obama's pick for head of the Council of Economic Advisers, Alan B. Krueger, has acknowledged that increasing unemployment benefits prolongs unemployment, as conservatives were quick to point out when he was nominated in August.
To some taxpayers, unemployment extensions are just another big government expenditure that comes out of their pockets and goes into someone else's. Some would rather see the money spent on projects with a return, like building highways and schools. Others prefer freeing businesses of expenses like the health care plan and new regulations.
Even among those struggling to find work, Mr. Tolleson is not alone in his views. In a recent survey of the unemployed by Rutgers University, more than one in four respondents was opposed to renewing the current extended unemployment benefits. Three out of five said recipients should be required to take training courses.
Mr. Tolleson, who lives in Houston and whose last good job was working for a group that aims to replace the income tax with a national sales tax, said he filed for unemployment after a church said it could not help him otherwise. But, he said, he knows the money is not free: ''They either tax it from somebody who's making money or they're going to print it -- either way, the economy goes down.''
Theresa Gorski, a pharmaceutical sales rep in Detroit before losing her job 17 months ago, once shared his skepticism of prolonging unemployment benefits.
''If you would have asked me five years ago, I would have said no, because I always considered myself a Republican,'' said Ms. Gorski, 50. ''But now being in this position, with a college education and lots of work experience behind me, I find myself swinging more liberal, and more Democrat. And that would never have happened before.''
This recession has left more people unemployed for longer than ever before. In September, nearly seven million people were receiving unemployment benefits, and the Census Bureau says the payments lifted more than three million people out of poverty last year. Keeping the extensions in place for another year would cost $49 billion, the White House estimates.
Unemployment benefits vary from state to state and are based on the worker's previous earnings, with most states using a tax on employers to cover 26 weeks after a job loss. In mid-2008, the federal government began to pay for a series of extensions that brought that total to 99 weeks in the states with the highest unemployment rates. About 20 states now offer the maximum of 99 weeks, but under Mr. Obama's proposal, that would drop to nine states in March and three in April. That would leave most states offering about 70 weeks of benefits.
Republican leaders in Congress have not said whether they will support the extensions, but they have opposed them in the past. In a Congressional hearing Thursday, they expressed frustration that repeated renewals of the extensions had not yielded better results.
Economists generally agree that unemployment benefits encourage some job seekers to delay accepting a job, thus raising the unemployment rate. A study by the San Francisco Federal Reserve last year found that the benefit extensions had increased the rate by four-tenths of a percentage point.
A more recent paper by Jesse Rothstein, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley, found that about half the increase was simply because recipients were required to look for work and therefore continue to be counted in the labor force. Otherwise, many would have dropped out. Only people actively looking for work are counted among the unemployed.
Though his nomination was approved by a Senate committee on Thursday, Mr. Krueger is avoiding speaking publicly as he awaits confirmation. That has prevented him from defending himself to those conservatives who have happily cited his acknowledgement that benefits may prolong unemployment.
But he has written that the impact was likely to be smaller in a harsh economic climate. In a study conducted between fall 2009 and spring 2010 in New Jersey, Mr. Krueger and his co-author, Andreas Mueller, found that only one out of five unemployed people had received a job offer, and that workers did not spend more time looking for work or lower their acceptable salary level after their benefits lapsed.
In interviews, job seekers insist they are applying for jobs at salaries far below what they are used to, in fields they have never worked in before, and are still not having any luck.
Preston Venzant, 47, who lost his job in Houston repairing commercial kitchen equipment, said he had decided not to apply for unemployment benefits over the objections of his wife.
''I don't want the federal government giving me an incentive not to work, period,'' he said. ''My personal opinion is, you're supposed to go find work, and if you can't find it in the business that you were once in, be it a C.E.O. or a street sweeper, you have to find employment and your lifestyle has to change, so be it.''
After months of looking, Mr. Venzant said, he has gotten an offer that will give him two years of work, with free room and board and five weeks' vacation. All he has to do is move to Russia.

HEADLINE: Moving On, Minus Its Genius: Master of the Media Marketplace, and Its Demanding Gatekeeper

BYLINE: By BEN SISARIO; Brooks Barnes and Jeremy W. Peters contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Last November, Steven P. Jobs finally achieved his long-sought goal of bringing the Beatles to iTunes. But years before he made the deal, he began working on the promotional campaign for the music, personally designing advertisements that would sit in virtual mothballs as long as necessary.
''He just sat them there waiting for the day,'' said Roger Faxon, the chief executive of the EMI Group, the Beatles' label. ''They were beautiful ads.''
As the man who introduced the iPod, iPhone and iPad to the world, Mr. Jobs became a kind of folk hero of American business for his intuitive understanding of consumer sentiment and his ability to make deals with some of the most obstinate players in entertainment and media.
He was, according to Bono of U2 in a statement on Thursday, ''one of a very small group of anarchic Americans who through technology literally invented the 21st century. We all miss the hardware software Elvis.'' 
In many ways, the Beatles agreement was the perfect distillation of Mr. Jobs's determination -- and his complete confidence -- in melding technology and culture. But for the media companies at the other end of those deals, Mr. Jobs was a far more complex figure. As executives in music, film and publishing have learned, a deal with Mr. Jobs and Apple meant inclusion in one of the most important digital marketplaces on the planet, and the potential for greater sales than from any other outlet. But the deals were inevitably made on Mr. Jobs's strict terms.
''Steve's approach to the magazine industry was, 'My way or the highway,' '' said Jann Wenner, the founder and editor of Rolling Stone, who dealt with Apple over the magazine's iPad edition.
Of all media businesses, music has had the most fraught relationship with Apple. It was the first entertainment industry to find its basic business model shaken by the Internet, when Napster in 1999 ushered in mass illegal file-sharing. ITunes was clearly the only workable solution, said one senior executive at a major label, but Mr. Jobs's demands that songs be sold individually and all at 99 cents made the labels uncomfortable.
''He was a genius and he was creative, but he was also fairly imperious,'' said Bill Werde, the editorial director of Billboard. ''When Apple has leverage, Apple uses leverage.''
Stories about Mr. Jobs's efforts to persuade the leaders of the industry to his side are legion. For years, he remained stubbornly, victoriously inflexible about matters like pricing. He personally demonstrated iTunes to figures like Bono and Jimmy Iovine, the chairman of Interscope Geffen A&M, wowing them in much the same way he did crowds of software developers and journalists at the company's regular product introductions.
''We swallowed hard,'' said the senior label executive, who did not want his name used because of Apple's well-known secrecy about negotiations and contracts. ''But if anybody could pull this off, Steve could.''
The iTunes store has sold 16 billion songs in its eight years in business. Yet for music companies, it has been a mixed blessing. Overall music sales declined 32 percent in 2010 from 2003, when the iTunes store was introduced, according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry. Digital music, while still growing, has not made up for the money lost from CDs.
For many in other forms of media, however, Apple has all but saved the music labels from a far worse fate.
''The cautionary tale in music was not how they did business but that they waited,'' said Robert W. Pittman, the chief executive of Clear Channel Communications and a former top executive at MTV and AOL. Music executives ''didn't realize that in the digital age, the consumer can get access to content in other ways that they had no control over,'' he said.
For others, music has been an example of an industry that gave up too much control to Apple. The company faced a revolt from magazine and newspaper publishers this year when it insisted on keeping 30 percent of the money from subscriptions sold in its app ecosystem and on controlling all customer data for those transactions. With services like Google offering more favorable terms to publishers, Apple agreed to some flexibility.
''There is no point for me or any other publisher to give them the name of my customer in exchange for two or three thousand replacement readers, so that ultimately, like the music business, I will be totally out of touch and not control the delivery,'' said Mr. Wenner.
Hollywood's relationship with Mr. Jobs has also been tense. As the founder of Pixar Animation Studios and the largest shareholder in the Walt Disney Company, Mr. Jobs was not cowed by Hollywood. Pixar, which Mr. Jobs subsidized for years before the company hit paydirt with ''Toy Story,'' established the template for much of Hollywood's current output of well-crafted digital animation that combines fairy-tale narratives with sophisticated adult humor. (It also made Mr. Jobs one of Hollywood's richest moguls and the single largest shareholder in Disney.)
But the major movie studios and television companies have dealt carefully with Apple, looking to distribute their digital products through multiple stores and in many forms, like Netflix and cable systems.
''Motion picture and TV companies are very determined to create an Internet distribution ecosystem that avoids the problems that have befallen the music industry,'' said Warren Lieberfarb, former president of Warner Home Video and now an industry consultant. ''The studio nightmare of all nightmares is that you only have one customer.''
Yet Mr. Jobs's business genius, as many see it, has been his ability to negotiate and bring virtually any company into the Apple fold, while compromising little, if at all. His tenacity was the stuff of legend. But many executives say his love for art and media in even its most minute details made him persuasive.
Richard Stengel, the managing editor of Time, said that despite Mr. Jobs's reputation as a digital Svengali, he had an almost romantic attachment to print.
''He used to talk about the aesthetics of magazine making,'' Mr. Stengel said. ''He always fancied himself as better than anybody else at anything. And I think one of his fantasy jobs would have been as a magazine editor.''
Mr. Jobs's understanding of the mind of the consumer never failed to impress other executives, like Robert A. Iger, Disney's chief executive.
''He would call me on Saturday afternoons and we'd chat for an hour,'' Mr. Iger said. ''We had great talks about the future of digital media, and each one was about how people would ultimately consume things.''
''It was never about the distribution mechanism,'' he said. ''It was, 'What will people want?' ''

HEADLINE: Obama Describe Economy As Dire

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES; Jennifer Steinhauer contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- In perhaps his most sober remarks about the economy this year, President Obama on Thursday described the weakening economy as ''an emergency'' and made the case for his jobs bill as ''an insurance policy against a possible double-dip recession.''
''Our economy really needs a jolt right now,'' Mr. Obama said at the White House, in an abruptly scheduled morning news conference timed to pressure Republicans before the Senate begins debate on his bill, which is scheduled for next week.
''This is not the time for the usual political gridlock,'' the president added. ''The problems Europe is having today could have a very real effect on our economy at a time when it's already fragile.'' 
Mr. Obama repeatedly cited the findings of independent economists that his $447 billion package, which calls for tax cuts, public works spending and federal aid to reduce teacher layoffs, would reduce unemployment and bolster economic growth. He challenged Republicans to offer a plan that likewise could be assessed by outside analysts and win similarly good marks. And Mr. Obama said that if his full plan fails, Democrats will press for votes on its individual parts.
Timothy F. Geithner, the treasury secretary, echoed Mr. Obama in testimony on Capitol Hill, and said the jobs bill could help increase business and consumer confidence.
The White House scheduled the news conference not only to set up next week's Senate debate but also to get in front of Friday's release of September employment numbers. The report is expected once again to show job growth too anemic to significantly reduce a jobless rate that has hovered at 9 percent.
For all of Mr. Obama's pressure over the past month -- a speech to a joint session of Congress, coast-to-coast travel and a pugnacious new stump style -- prospects for the jobs plan remain uncertain. Republicans, who control the House and can filibuster bills in the Senate if they remain united, generally oppose the plan; they say temporary tax cuts and spending will not create jobs, and they oppose raising taxes on affluent individuals and corporations.
To allay the concerns of Senate Democrats, Mr. Obama said that he could support their proposal to pay for the jobs plan by imposing a 5.6 percent surtax on individual taxpayers' income above $1 million. A number of Senate Democrats had objected to Mr. Obama's proposals to offset the cost of his plan by limiting tax deductions, including for charitable contributions, that could be taken by individuals making more than $200,000 and couples making more than $250,000. And oil-state Democrats opposed his plans to increase oil companies' taxes.
Even as Mr. Obama took reporters' questions, Speaker John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio, rebuked him for his more confrontational tack. ''Nothing has disappointed me more than what's happened over the last five weeks, to watch the president of the United States give up on governing, give up on leading and spend full-time campaigning,'' Mr. Boehner said during a public forum in Washington.
Mr. Obama, when asked by a reporter whether he should be talking to Congressional Republicans rather than traveling the country like a presidential candidate, responded that he had tried repeatedly to compromise with Republicans. His efforts, he said, were ''sometimes to my own political peril and to the frustration of Democrats,'' and Republicans rebuffed him even when he offered ideas, like business tax cuts, that Republicans had proposed in the past.
''What I've done over the last several weeks is to take the case to the American people so that they understand what's at stake,'' he said. ''It is now up to all the senators, and hopefully all the members of the House, to explain to their constituencies why they would be opposed to common-sense ideas that historically have been supported by Democrats and Republicans in the past.''
The president even returned to the point, unbidden, when he closed the 74-minute news conference. ''I would love nothing more,'' he said, ''than to see Congress act so aggressively that I can't campaign against them as a do-nothing Congress.''
In prodding Republicans, Mr. Obama plainly had in mind the small number of moderates in the party who might join with the 53 Senate Democrats and independents to get to 60 voters and overcome a filibuster. Citing examples of how he believed his jobs plan would help, he named a Boston teacher with long experience and a master's degree, who has been laid off three times because of budget cuts in Massachusetts -- the home of Senator Scott P. Brown, a Republican facing a re-election race next year. Mr. Obama also cited a bridge that he said was falling apart in Maine, which is represented by two Republican senators, Olympia J. Snowe and Susan Collins.
Republicans have not produced any alternative jobs bills, reflecting their arguments that past stimulus measures have not worked. Instead, they say that to create jobs it is crucial to roll back federal regulations, pass free-trade bills and cut spending.
Mr. Obama said that while he agreed with some of the Republicans' proposals -- for example, he recently sent three trade bills to Congress for its approval -- he said they would not help the economy in the short term. Economists at private-sector forecasting firms agreed.
While economic forecasts are not definitive, in that they are predictions, Macroeconomic Advisers, a St. Louis-based firm that the Federal Reserve often uses, has projected that the Obama jobs plan could increase economic growth by 1.25 percentage points and add 1.3 million jobs in 2012. Moody's Analytics, another firm, has estimated it would add two percentage points and up to 1.9 million jobs.
Joel Prakken, chairman of Macroeconomic Advisers, said Republicans had ''reasonable ideas'' but not ones that could be measured by the firm's forecasting model. He said he believed the proposals ''would have little immediate effect relative to a plan that stimulates aggregate demand'' -- that is, a plan like Mr. Obama's, with tax cuts and spending programs.
Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, similarly said the Republican proposals ''are generally good longer-term economic policy, but they won't mean much for the economy and job market in the next year.'' He continued: ''Given the high odds of another recession in the next few months, it is vital for Congress and the administration to provide some near-term support to the economy.''
By confirming that he would embrace the Senate Democrats' proposal for a millionaires' surtax, Mr. Obama tried to unify Democrats before the Senate debate on the jobs bill. Some senators, led by Charles E. Schumer of New York, had argued that Mr. Obama's proposal to raise taxes on income above $250,000 would hit too many taxpayers who are not truly rich.
''I'm fine with the approach that they're taking,'' Mr. Obama said. But he added that he still wanted Congress to overhaul the tax code to close loopholes and many tax breaks so that the new revenues could be used both to lower tax rates and to reduce annual budget deficits.
The Democrats' agreement on the proposed surcharge suggested that Mr. Obama could have trouble later keeping a prominent campaign promise: to let the Bush-era tax rates expire after 2012 for households with taxable income exceeding $250,000. As Republicans pointed out, the Senate Democrats' stance indicated they would oppose letting taxes rise for individuals with incomes under $1 million.
In the Senate, the Republican minority leader, Mitch McConnell, tried for the second time this week to force a vote on Mr. Obama's jobs plan immediately, given Democrats' acknowledgment that they do not have the 60 votes needed to pass it. But he failed again on a procedural vote. Instead the Senate is expected to take up the Democratic jobs package on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Detecting a Thaw in Myanmar, U.S. Aims to Encourage Change

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS and THOMAS FULLER; Steven Lee Myers reported from Washington, and Thomas Fuller from Bangkok.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The United States is considering a significant shift in its long-strained relationship with the autocratic government of Myanmar, including relaxing restrictions on financial assistance and taking other steps to encourage what senior American officials describe as startling political changes in the country.
The thawing, while in its early stages, follows a political transition in Myanmar after deeply flawed elections last year that nonetheless appears to have raised the possibility that the new government will ease its restrictions on basic freedoms and cooperate with the repressed opposition movement led by the Nobel laureate Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.
The new president, U Thein Sein, a former general who was part of the military junta that ruled the country for two decades, has in six months in office signaled a sharp break from the highly centralized and erratic policies of the past. Mr. Thein Sein's government is now rewriting laws on taxes and property ownership, loosening restrictions on the media and even discussing the release of political prisoners. 
The apparent shift offers the United States the chance to improve ties with a resource-rich Southeast Asian nation that after many years of semi-isolation counts neighboring China as its main ally. Last week, Myanmar's new leadership unexpectedly halted work on a $3.6 billion dam strongly backed by China, prompting angry criticism from the Chinese government and the state-owned Chinese company that was building it.
The Obama administration, though skeptical, has responded to this new openness with a series of small diplomatic steps of its own, hoping that a democratic transition in Myanmar could bring stability and greater economic opportunities to the region at a time of increasing American competition with China over influence in Asia.
''We're going to meet their action with action,'' the administration's newly appointed special envoy to Myanmar, Derek Mitchell, said in an interview. ''If they take steps, we will take steps to demonstrate that we are supportive of the path to reform.'' Mr. Mitchell spent five days last month in Myanmar, meeting with senior leaders in the government and opposition. That visit was followed by two meetings in New York and Washington last week between senior State Department officials and Myanmar's new foreign minister, U Wunna Maung Lwin.
Mr. Wunna Maung Lwin, whose travel in the United States is normally sharply restricted, was the first foreign minister from Myanmar invited to the State Department since the military junta took power.
The motivation for the changes has baffled American officials and others, but Myanmar appears eager to end its diplomatic isolation and rebuild a dysfunctional economy that has trapped the country's population of 55 million people in poverty, which the government acknowledged for the first time in Mr. Thein Sein's inaugural address in March.
Members of Mr. Thein Sein's government have since met several times with Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi, who was released from years of house arrest last November and whose name was so demonized by the previous junta that it was typically whispered in public. She, too, has expressed cautious support for what appears to be a political opening.
The government has also for the first time discussed with her and American officials the possibility of releasing hundreds of political prisoners, after years of denying there were any at all. The government has even assembled a list of those it is considering releasing. About 600 people are on it, though opposition leaders and diplomats say that there are nearly 2,000 political prisoners listed in a database compiled by an organization in Thailand. ''We told the government we cannot accept their list,'' said U Win Tin, a founding member of the National League for Democracy, Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi's party. ''We gave that message to the government, but we don't know yet whether they will change their list.''
Even so, the senior administration official said that the mere acknowledgment that Myanmar held political prisoners reflected a significant shift in the new government's attitude. Signals like that, even if tentative, have begun to win over skeptics who have seen false dawns before in Myanmar.
''It's very exciting,'' said Priscilla A. Clapp, who was the chief of mission at the United States Embassy in Myanmar from 1999 to 2002. ''They are moving into a more pluralistic form of government. I wouldn't call it totally democratic. But things are changing very rapidly.''
Ms. Clapp and others warned that the changes, which are exceeding expectations inside Myanmar and abroad, remained a work in progress. ''Any transition this dramatic is a recipe for instability,'' she said. ''Anything can happen. There could be a coup, a counterrevolution.''
Senior Gen. Than Shwe, who led the junta for nearly two decades and stepped down in March, remains an uncertain factor in the tumultuous transition. It was under General Than Shwe's leadership that the government carried out a deadly crackdown on protests led by Buddhist monks in 2007 and restricted foreign aid in the aftermath of a cyclone that killed more than 100,000 people.
The reasons that General Than Shwe ceded power to the current government have not been fully explained beyond the notion that he was ready for retirement. In leading the drive for reforms, Mr. Thein Sein appears to be siding with a younger generation of military officers who believe that maintaining the junta's oppressive policies and hermetic attitudes toward the outside world would be a dead-end path for the country.
The decision by Mr. Thein Sein last week to suspend work on the giant hydroelectric dam on the Irrawaddy River was interpreted by many as a sign that the president was moving out from under the shadow of General Than Shwe.
Obama administration officials are now debating additional steps to support the nascent changes and encourage more, including the creation of a truly democratic political system and an end to violence against Myanmar's ethnic minorities. The outreach is being closely coordinated with Congress, with other countries, including members of the European Union, and with Myanmar's opposition.
''We're not looking to move I think any faster than anyone else here,'' Mr. Mitchell said. ''I think we're all looking to move step by step. We are going to test. There is no single point where we are absolutely certain that reform is going to be sustained and irreversible.''
Myanmar faces American sanctions first imposed in 1997 and expanded as recently as 2008. One hundred senior officials or businesses remain on the Department of the Treasury's list banning any commercial trade. Lifting those sanctions would require new legislation in Congress. That is unlikely to happen unless Myanmar convinces its critics that its transformation is fundamental.
In the meantime, though, the administration is considering waiving some restrictions on trade and financial assistance and lifting prohibitions on assistance by global financial institutions, like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. An I.M.F. team is scheduled to visit this month for consultations on modernizing the country's exchange rate system and lifting restrictions on international transactions.
Assistance like that is needed to overhaul what for years was a Soviet-style planned economy, where the military ran factories producing soap and bicycles. Ancient-looking cars still ride on potholed roads, and some buildings look as if their last coat of paint was applied during the days when Myanmar was a British colony, known as Burma.
Many in Myanmar remain unconvinced that genuine democracy has arrived.
''All these Western countries are hearing about some changes and they are very happy and keen,'' said Mr. Win Tin of the opposition party. ''I think that's wrong. They should listen very carefully and wait to see whether what this government calls change is real and genuine.''
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton echoed that caution. She recently noted what she called ''welcome gestures'' but raised a series of issues. ''We have serious questions and concerns across a wide range of issues -- from Burma's treatment of ethnic minorities and more than 2,000 prisoners to its relations with North Korea,'' she said, using Myanmar's colonial name, which is official American policy.
She added that the day before she spoke, a 21-year-old journalist was sentenced to 10 years in prison in Myanmar.

HEADLINE: From Kindergarten to College Completion

BYLINE: JUDITH SCOTT-CLAYTON


HIGHLIGHT: Investment in early childhood education seems to produce a variety of payoffs, including more children who graduate from college, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
A report released last week has drawn new attention to low degree-completion rates among college entrants, particularly among those who never attend full time. The organization that published the report, Complete College America, seeks to rally policy makers around the goal of substantially increasing completion rates by 2020.
But here's a question: if we want to increase college completions over the longer term, is it more cost-effective to direct resources to college students or to preschoolers and kindergarteners? 
The influential economist and Nobel laureate James Heckman, among others, has asserted that early educational investments have the highest return, because of the cumulative nature of skill development ("skill begets skill"). By the time a high school student is on the verge of college (or an older worker is considering returning to school), this argument goes, it may be too expensive to try to fix skill deficiencies that trace back decades.

Yet the federal government continues to invest far more in higher education than in early childhood programs (see chart). For example, the Pell Grant program received more than $28 billion in 2009, compared with less than $10 billion for Head Start. 
A new study presented last week at a Federal Reserve Bank conference on education and employment adds to the growing body of evidence that early educational experiences can affect outcomes in college and beyond. (Note: Susan Dynarski, one of the study's co-authors, was my doctoral adviser.) The study found that kindergarteners randomly assigned to smaller classes through the Project Star experiment were 2.7 percentage points more likely to enroll in college and 1.6 percentage points more likely to complete a degree by age 30. 
While the magnitude of these effects may sound modest, they are statistically and substantively significant compared with the control group's attendance rate (38 percent) and degree completion rate (15 percent). And the effects were much larger among minorities and at-risk students. 
Previous experimental and quasi-experimental studies have found large effects of both the Abecedarian and Perry Preschool programs and the Head Start program on college enrollments. A consistent and fascinating pattern in all of these studies is that early effects on test scores tend to fade over time, only to re-emerge as effects on college-going and other adult outcomes. 
When it comes to cost-effectiveness, however, the new study challenges the theory that early investments are always better. The 33 percent reduction in class size evaluated by the Project Star experiment was not cheap, and the authors estimate that it cost more than $400,000 per additional student induced to attend college as a result of program participation (calculated by dividing the $12,000 per-student cost of the program by the estimated college impact of 0.027). 
Using impact estimates from other studies, the researchers calculate that programs aimed at individuals on the brink of college have the biggest bang for the buck - if the goal is college attainment. 
For example, a recent experiment that randomly selected people to receive assistance with completing and submitting a federal financial aid application found that this assistance, which cost only $88 per participant, increased college enrollments by seven percentage points.
An enormous caveat to this analysis is that good early childhood programs have been shown to improve a host of outcomes even for those who never attend college, including childhood health and mortality. Moreover, scholarship programs and financial aid application assistance may work only to the extent that there is a pool of people who can benefit from college but aren't already enrolled - so their current cost-benefit ratios may not be infinitely scalable. 
Finally, some interventions at the college level may increase attainment simply by handing out more degrees rather than by fundamentally increasing skills (an extreme example of this is a new effort to locate and award degrees to former students who earned enough credits but never asked for their diplomas).
Based on both theory and evidence, it is hard to argue that we're not underinvesting in early childhood education. Even policy makers who care only about college completion rates should be looking for promising interventions in the earliest years of life. 
But that's no reason to write off later interventions. There appear to be opportunities for cost-effective investment all along the educational continuum.

HEADLINE: A New Use for LEDs: Mind Control

BYLINE: MICHAEL KANELLOS


HIGHLIGHT: New ventures are experimenting with LED bulbs that affect mood, ease jet lag, entice customers and restore circadian rhythms. 

 BODY:
Fred Maxik wants to make a light bulb that will help you sleep.
"Biological specific lights," tuned so as not to interfere with an individual's normal production of melatonin, the hormone secreted from the pineal gland linked to sleepiness, could begin to hit the market in about two years, according to Mr. Maxik, a founder of the Lighting Science Group, which specializes in LED bulbs. 
With a biological bulb, you could read at night without experiencing the nagging irritability that can occur after using a computer or sitting close to a lamp near bedtime. 
And other bulbs -- or the same bulb programmed via a network- could help make consumers feel more refreshed in the morning by choreographing their wake-up ritual. "We could even do things like lights for sterilization, with photo catalysts" for bathrooms in perhaps five to six years, he added.

While solid state lights and LED bulbs have been promoted as a tools for energy conservation, industry experts and executives suggest that efficiency will become a Trojan horse for a host of unexpected and arguably more valuable applications. Light-emitting diodes, after all, are semiconductors that can be programmed to emit light at precise wavelengths, colors and tones. Traditional light bulbs, the last vestige of the vacuum tube era, produce light with hot gases or wires. 
Greater control over light would ideally lead to greater control over the surrounding environment, researchers suggest. "Light has these biological and behavior effects -- why not build on it?" said George C. Brainard, a professor of neurology at the Jefferson Medical College at Thomas Jefferson University and one of the leading researchers in the field. 
Dr. Brainard predicts that over the next decade or two, health benefits will come to be considered one of the primary attributes of bulbs along with energy consumption, aesthetics and brightness. He and Lighting Science are working with NASA on LED lights that are intended to allow astronauts to better adjust to phenomena like the 90-minute "days" experienced on the orbiting International Space Station.
Boeing included LEDs in the cabin of the new 787 Dreamliner that dim and increase in intensity to slightly adjust the circadian rhythms of passengers on transcontinental flights. The hope is that it will help passengers more easily adjust to jet lag. 
Meanwhile, researchers at Japan's Keio University and elsewhere have experimented with LED traffic lights and car taillights that emit photons in pulses like optical fibers. While humans can't visually perceive the difference, the pulses serve up a data stream about traffic conditions or potential accidents.
"An LED is a light source, but it is an infinitely controllable source," said Zach Gentry, an executive at enLighted, a company that combines LEDs with temperature, light and occupancy sensors to produce a device that monitors energy consumption and physical activity in office buildings. EnLighted just raised $14 million in capital.
The National Institute of Mental Health discovered the connection between light and health in 1980 in an experiment that showed bright white light could suppress melatonin production. A few years later at Harvard, scientists demonstrated that circadian rhythms could be disrupted. 
Then in 2001, Dr. Brainard found that circadian rhythms could be disrupted with fairly low levels of blue light. He and others concluded that the eye must have undiscovered photoreceptors sensitive to blue light that perform nonvisual functions. It was a somewhat radical notion, but a year later, scientists at Brown University and Johns Hopkins physically isolated the receptor.
Light therapy is already used to treat seasonal affective disorder and premature infants. The Lighting Research Center at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute has noted associations between disruptions in the natural light-dark cycle and increased incidents of insomnia and breast cancer.
Traditional light sources can have the same physiological impact. LEDs, however, are easier to control. More important, the physiological effects can be triggered with comparatively low levels of blue light, which LEDs emit natively. 
White light LEDs are actually blue LEDs covered by a yellow phosphor. Tinkering with the phosphors or combining blue and "white" LEDs in the same bulb could result in a somewhat more economical, compact "health" bulb. 
While mood lighting for ordinary consumers remains a few years out, the public has already begun to experience some of the hidden benefits of LEDs. Many upscale retailers have installed LEDs to achieve special lighting effects or to make jewelry cases sparkle. Subway, the sandwich chain, is installing LED fixtures from Lunera Lighting in some outlets to enhance their appearance.
"You can create a color perspective that makes people look good," said Don Peifer, one of the company's co-founders. Before starting up Lunera, which specializes in LED fixtures that evenly "wash" offices and lobbies with light, Mr. Peifer worked as a lighting designer for photographers like Annie Leibovitz and Steven Klein.
Lunera has also installed fixtures in eBay's data centers that eliminate vertical shadows in computer racks. 
Redwood Systems, another Silicon Valley start-up, and enLighted are combining LEDs with temperature and occupancy sensors to help retailers determine whether consumers stop at certain aisles and whether check-out lines are growing shorter or longer. 
Humans and artificial lighting have never been an ideal combination. Circadian disorders result from placing humans in unnatural situations. "Before the Industrial Revolution, people worked in fields," Mr. Peifer said. "There was a really strong dichotomy between night and day."
Maybe LEDs can restore some of the balance. "We don't know what will happen in the future of lighting, and that is the exciting part of it," Mr. Peifer said.

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Brazil did it. 

 BODY:
Floyd Norris has a good piece about Argentina's exit from the convertibility law as a precedent for possible euro exit. Regular readers know that I've been at that parallel for a long time.
As Dean Baker points out, however, Floyd errs slightly in attributing Argentina's problem to inflation. Actually, Argentina was facing deflation; the trouble was that by pegging to the United States, which did not by any means dominate its trade, Argentina exposed itself to the fluctuations of the dollar (any perceived similarities to the problem of a gold standard are completely right). The real final stroke, however, came from this:
When Brazil, Argentina's very big neighbor, devalued, that pushed the peso over the edge.

HEADLINE: Big Deal | Gilded Then, Gilded Now

BYLINE: SARAH KERSHAW


HIGHLIGHT: A castlelike five-story structure and a house with an ultramodern interior are two of the three remaining town houses on a historic block between 84th and 85th Streets. 

 BODY:
It is a historic moment on the block of Central Park West between 84th and 85th Streets.
That's saying a lot given that the story of this tiny slice of Manhattan dates back to the late 1800s, when William Noble, a prominent builder of the day, had nine row houses constructed, Nos. 241 to 249 Central Park West. At the time they were considered decadently expensive, each costing $37,000 to build.
Now two of the remaining three town houses on the block are for sale: No. 249, a castlelike five-story structure on the corner of 85th Street, went on the market on Sept. 27 for $30 million (or for rent at $50,000 a month). No. 247, which has six stories, was renovated into a modern behemoth by Keith D. Monda, a former president of the luxury goods company Coach, who first put it on the market in the spring of 2010 for $32 million. In May the price was lowered to $25 million. 
The broker handling the sale of No. 247, Mara Flash Blum of Sotheby's International Realty, likes to call the property "a private Guggenheim." And this does not feel like such an exaggeration, given that the house is filled with contemporary art - to the point where it appears that every available wall space has an enormous work by an enormously famous artist.
The other six houses on the block were bought by a developer, and 241 Central Park West, a prewar luxury rental building, now stands in their place. No. 248, in between the two town houses for sale, has also remained a single residence; along with its neighbors it is one of the last remaining such homes on the park.
No. 249, with a Renaissance Revival-style facade, has more than 10,000 square feet of space. It contains a triplex with four bedrooms and four and a half bathrooms. The two floors above the triplex, which had been configured as apartments, were gutted after the tenants moved out, and the property is being marketed as a single town house.
The seller, who declined to be identified, bought the town house in 2007 for $14.4 million, city property records show. The owner never moved in but planned extensive renovations, intending among other things to dig seven feet below the basement and install an indoor basketball court, said Felise Gross of Brown Harris Stevens, a co-broker on the listing. The seller also obtained city approval to add another 2,500 square feet of space, Ms. Gross said, but later decided not to renovate and instead put the town house on the market.
No. 247 has five bedrooms, six bathrooms, two half baths, an elevator and about 12,270 square feet of space, including several outdoor terraces.
Mr. Monda, who bought the town house in 2006 for $15.5 million from Abigail E. Disney, a scion of the Disney family, said he was selling because he had retired to Sarasota, Fla., and planned to spend only the summers in New York.
"That's a big house for two months of the year," he said.

HEADLINE: At Harvest Time, Bronx Farm Works Through a Tough Patch

BYLINE: DAVID GONZALEZ


HIGHLIGHT: La Finca del Sur has been a haven for a neighborhood of immigrants, evoking the agricultural life of rural parts of Mexico and the Caribbean where many come from. Sometimes the South Bronx intrudes. 

 BODY:
 This has been a cruel harvest at La Finca del Sur. It's not that the land has been stingy with string beans, tomatoes or cabbage. No, the problem has come from the streets that surround this unlikely Bronx farm tucked between a highway ramp and the Metro-North tracks on 138th Street and the Grand Concourse. 
 In the last two weeks, thieves have broken into a shipping-container-turned-storage-shed and stolen generators, mowers, amplifiers and anything else that could fetch a buck. With it, they have taken the sense of community and safety that has imbued these two and a half acres since the farm began three years ago.
 "First, I cried, then I said I was surprised it hadn't happened sooner," said Nancy Ortiz-Surun, one of a core group of women volunteers who run the farm. "This was envisioned as a safe space, particularly for women. We've had to deal with people coming in and setting up an encampment, homeless men sleeping in the yard. And now this? It's not the loss of material things. It's the sense of how vulnerable we are."
 There have been all sorts of vulnerabilities in the surrounding Mott Haven neighborhood that is home to La Finca del Sur, which is Spanish for the Farm of the South. In their little industrial corner, green space had been hard to come by. So it was that two community groups working on environmental issues established the urban farm.
 The idea was to create a women-run space that would address issues of a healthy heart, soul and community in an area where many residents hailed from rural parts of Mexico and the Caribbean. They laid out neat plots, trucked in good soil and tended their farm behind a plain - if flimsy - fence. They harvest vegetables that are sold at a local farmers' market, educate school groups and neighbors on proper diet and host poetry, music and film events. 
 "When people come to New York, because of economic issues they buy and eat what they can afford," said Ms. Ortiz-Surun, whose family is from Puerto Rico. "This, to me, is all about laying down roots. Puerto Ricans have moved so far from that, yet we brought that tradition here. Our grandmothers grew herbs that could heal. We need to show that."
 Cayetano Reyes can relate. He joined the farm this summer - renting out two plots for $20, which he quickly turned into thick little patches bursting with tomatillos, jalapenos, okra, melons and tomatoes. Colorful flowers poke out from the thicket, ready to be picked and placed before the mural of Our Lady of Guadalupe adorning Saint Jerome's church a few blocks away. 
 "It's important for children to know how I grew up in Mexico with these traditions," said Mr. Reyes, a forklift operator who has lived in New York for 20 years. "In New York, you buy everything at a store. But in this farm, we grow organic vegetables. It's healthier."
 It's safer, too, than the streets. Or so he had thought until the recent thefts.
 Undaunted, he and his children tended to their modest harvest. Rosalba chased the black-and-white cat that prowled the wood-chip covered paths between the plots. Giovanni marveled at a thick piece of okra, that was bursting with seeds. Ms. Orti-Surun scooped them out into his waiting hands.
 "A plant is going to grow from each of these," she said to him. "Think about that."

HEADLINE: More Evidence of a Big Greenhouse Advantage from Gas Over Coal

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: A new analysis supports other work showing a big climate benefit from choosing gas over coal for electricity generation. 

 BODY:
The Worldwatch Institute and Deutsche Bank Climate Change Advisors recently analyzed the full greenhouse impacts of natural gas and coal -- from the well or mine to the power plant -- and the work supports other studies pointing to a large and clear climate advantage from gas as a source of electricity. Here's a news release and a pdf of the study. 
The report also emphasizes something that Clifford Krauss and I reported in 2009 -- the enormous potential to make gas an even better option on the path to a non-polluting energy future by cutting releases and leaks from gas wells and other oil and gas infrastructure (something that can be done at a profit in most cases). I'm re-posting a video that illustrates the invisible problem, and opportunity, in cleaning up gas emissions: 
There's plenty to do to ensure that gas extraction takes place in ways that don't threaten states with environmental or economic harm. But this work is more evidence that a "just say no" approach to expanded gas production makes little sense.

For those seeking a weekend read on energy policy, I recommend an exploration of literature -- old and new -- on the subject in the New York Review of Books by the Yale economist William Nordhaus.

HEADLINE: 'My Last Play' Is One for the Books

BYLINE: JENNIFER SCHUESSLER


HIGHLIGHT: And there were a whole lot of those books. 

 BODY:
The shelves were definitely empty on Monday night when Ed Schmidt wrapped up the final performance of "My Last Play," his one-man show about acknowledging a lifetime of failure in the theater by giving away his collection of 2,000 theater books.
The play charmed audiences who came 12 at a time to see the show in Mr. Schmidt's living room in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, starting last fall, each walking away with an inscribed book. But his landlord's lawyers were less charmed, and after a summerlong hiatus the final five performances were held at a bookstore, the powerHouse Arena in Dumbo.
In the end, Mr. Schmidt staged more then 90 performances and cultivated a word-of-mouth success that eliminated all the middlemen. He may have also suggested a new economics of selling used books. With some 1,300 tickets sold at $25 each, Mr. Schmidt undoubtedly got more for his collection than a dealer would have offered.
In a telephone interview Mr. Schmidt wanted to assure his worried audience - some of whom had openly wondered about his mental health - that his theatrical career wasn't really over. "It's my last play, certainly, if you define last as most recent," he said. "Is it the last I'm going to write? No."
In the meantime, a documentary about "My Last Play" is in the works, and Mr. Schmidt also hopes to self-publish a book documenting the production, along with his previous home-based one-man show, "The Last Supper." 
"It would be a funny irony," he said. "The play was about giving away all my books, and then at the end I create an actual physical book." 
While the book would contain the full script, Mr. Schmidt says he can't imagine the show working with another performer. But don't rule out the possibility of a revival. The shelves may have been bare on Monday, but Mr. Schmidt confessed he still has some 700 theater books at home.

HEADLINE: The Amazon Dieback Scenario

BYLINE: JUSTIN GILLIS


HIGHLIGHT: The notion that the Amazon forest could stop taking up carbon dioxide around 2050, die back, and then start emitting carbon took on new urgency after major droughts in 2005 and 2010. 

 BODY:
In an article last weekend about rising stress in the world's forests, I briefly mentioned that computer projections regarding the future of forests are still in a primitive state. 
Scientists cannot really say whether trees will continue to take up a big proportion of our carbon emissions through the rest of this century, or whether they will instead succumb to climate change on a large scale. 
You can find reports in the scientific literature to support both outcomes, and every prospect in between. Which scenario is right has big implications for how fast carbon dioxide builds up in the atmosphere, and therefore for how fast the climate warms. The stakes are also high for many beloved landscapes in the United States.
"Is it true that the forests of the eastern U.S. will continue to take up carbon?" said Paul R. Moorcroft, a Harvard professor who framed many of the issues for me. "What will happen in the West if, as predicted, the climate continues to warm and becomes increasingly arid, as it has done over the past couple of decades?"
The difficulty of predicting the future of forests under a rapidly changing climate means it is hard to know what to make of the current signs of distress.

Scientists are out in the field trying to gain a better understanding of how trees and forests respond to changes in climate. And they are using that knowledge to devise more sophisticated computer projections that narrow the range of possible outcomes.
One of the scarier possibilities to emerge from this body of work is worth dwelling on a bit, simply because it would be so devastating if it came to pass: the so-called Amazon dieback scenario. Many scientists were deeply skeptical of the idea when it was first published, but events in the last few years have made them less dismissive.
The scenario emerged most clearly in computer analyses in Britain led by Peter M. Cox of the University of Exeter and published in 2000 as a paper in the journal Nature. Running a large-scale computer simulation in which forests interacted with a changing global climate through the course of the 21st century, the Cox group found that forests would continue to take up carbon until about 2050. 
But then, their computer predicted, warmer temperatures and water stress would cause a massive dieback of the Amazon forest, which would stop absorbing carbon and start emitting it as a result.
That was a startling possibility for many reasons, not the least being that the Amazon is the richest single ecosystem left on the planet, and functioning as a major carbon sponge is only one of the critical roles it plays. Might the Amazon really die as a direct consequence of human-induced climate change?
The Nature paper set off a decade of research efforts to pin down a better answer. Many scientists believe that the original paper incorporated some overly pessimistic assumptions about temperature changes in the region, as well as a relatively crude representation of the Amazon forest. 
Some groups came to the opposite conclusion as the Cox group, finding in their forecasts that the Amazon forest remained robust throughout the coming century. Yet other papers supported the view that Amazon dieback is a real possibility, even if it might happen somewhat later in the century than originally predicted by the Cox group. As of now, the question remains unresolved. 
It took on a new urgency in 2005, however, when a severe drought hit the Amazon region, killing many large trees. That was followed in 2010 by an even larger drought with potentially worse damage - two "once a century" droughts just five years apart. The 2010 drought is still under study; some evidence suggests that the 2005 drought was linked to high Atlantic ocean temperatures that may in turn be linked to human emissions of carbon dioxide.
The droughts raise a disturbing question: Could the great dieback predicted for mid-century already be starting?
Scientists do not know. They say the effects of the two droughts are likely to be transient, but only if similar events do not recur anytime soon. Oliver L. Phillips, a researcher at the University of Leeds, led a team that documented a huge loss of carbon in the Amazon due to the 2005 drought. "The most likely outcome is that the forest will gain all that carbon back, and then some," he said in an interview.
But he and other scientists say that if the Amazon starts experiencing such droughts every few years, all bets are off.
"It's a worrisome moment for the Amazon," said Daniel C. Nepstad, an American scientist working at the Amazon Environmental Research Institute in Brazil to understand the pressures on the forest. "This is either just a big coincidence that we had these two severe droughts in close sequence, or it is a sign of things to come."
The dieback scenario has heightened the urgency that some policymakers and environmentalists feel about stopping deforestation in the region, a massive problem that began decades ago. The rate of forest destruction has declined from its high point in the 1990s and early 2000s as a result of several factors, including stronger efforts by the Brazilian government to control the Amazon frontier. 
But the level is still viewed as worrisome. Deforestation is a clear and present danger to the Amazon in itself, and the rising prices of soy and other commodities may add to the pressure by spurring new bouts of forest clearing. 
In the majority of computer projections, continued human destruction of the forest tends to push the climatic balance in the region in a direction that makes the dieback scenario more likely. Dr. Nepstad has led research suggesting that even without any feedback effects from climate change, half the Amazon forest could be destroyed or badly degraded by 2030 through interactions between human destruction, fire and drought unless stronger efforts are made to protect it.
The most ambitious proposal to slow deforestation, not just in the Amazon but throughout the tropics, goes by the acronym REDD, which stands for a mouthful of a program name: the Program on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries. 
It is basically a commitment by rich countries to pay countries in the tropics serious cash if they can slow their deforestation rates, with the results monitored intensively by satellites and airplanes before the big checks are cut.
But REDD has been slow to get off the ground. Rich countries have pledged nearly $5 billion so far, but that is considered just a down payment. 
The original theory was that the rich countries would set up carbon trading schemes that would send some money abroad for forest preservation. "There was this expectation that there was going to be a whole lot of money flowing," said Ralph Ashton, head of the Terrestrial Carbon Group, which has worked on the issue.
Yet most European countries ultimately balked at sending money abroad, and climate legislation in the United States stalled amid fears about the economic and political repercussions. So it is not at all clear that REDD will ever get launched in anything like the ambitious form that was originally envisioned. 
As I mentioned in my article, the state of California might allow some of its industries to comply with a forthcoming global-warming policy by steering money into tropical forest protection, but even that is no certainty. 
"If this linkage doesn't take place, then the hopes for REDD to survive could be greatly diminished," Dr. Nepstad said. If California does commit to tropical forest protection, advocates of REDD hope other states and countries, and perhaps large companies that buy food commodities, will follow suit, creating a substantial flow of funds.
Even paying for the science needed to understand what is happening in the Amazon has been a challenge. One of the most significant sources of funds has been the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, of Palo Alto, Calif., which has committed several hundred million dollars to scientific and conservation work in the region. See this project as an example. This write-up by an old classmate of mine, the Nature reporter Jeff Tollefson, offers a deeper look at a project supported by the Moore Foundation and led by the scientist Gregory P. Asner.
REDD, in addition to fomenting suspicions on the right about another big United Nations program, has picked up critics on the left who fear it will be hijacked for pay for tree-farming projects that actually harm real forests and may also undermine the rights of indigenous forest people.
Whether its advocates can steer REDD through this minefield and get it to work remains to be seen. And even if they do, will the Amazon forest - and forests in the rest of the world - remain resilient as human emissions accelerate in coming decades?

HEADLINE: European Salvo Worries Pipeline Advocates

BYLINE: JIM ROBBINS


HIGHLIGHT: Canadian officials vow to appeal to the World Trade Organization if the European Union classifies oil sands as a dirtier grade. 

 BODY:
In another wrinkle in the Keystone XL pipeline debate, the European Commission has given initial approval to a measure declaring that fuel from bitumen, the tar in oil sands, is higher in carbon dioxide emissions than conventional oil. 
This week's decision, which is not final, comes as the State Department prepares to decide whether the 1,700-mile pipeline, stretching from Alberta to the Gulf Coast, will be allowed to go forward. Environmentalists argue that the pipeline poses risks, and some residents of states through which it would run want it rerouted.
The pipeline has also been been a target of climate change activists who say that it is "dirty oil" and a major contributor to the carbon dioxide emissions that are warming the planet. They advocate greater reliance on cleaner energy sources.
Canadian officials have warned the European Union not to handicap the tar sands oil of Alberta with a designation that declares it a dirtier form of energy than conventional types of oil.

"Should the European Union implement unjustified measures which discriminate against the oil-sands, we won't hesitate to defend our interests," Canada's natural resources minister, Joe Oliver, said this week during a visit to Washington to meet with lawmakers.
While Europe does not import Canadian oil, Canadian officials fear that the new fuel directive would stigmatize it. 
Mr. Oliver warned that Canada would appeal to the World Trade Organization if the European Union adopted the standard, which he said was not scientifically justified. The European Parliament must approve the measure for it to take effect. 
 The conflict comes as a new Eurobarometer poll shows that 89 percent of Europeans believe that climate change is a serious problem and 64 percent believe it is very serious. A majority of respondents said climate change was a more serious problem than the current economic crisis. 
The European Union itself has pledged to cut its carbon dioxide emissions by 20 percent by 2020 with the goal of diminishing its own contribution to global warming.
 Canadian environmentalists applauded the fuel proposal by the European Union. "It's discouraging, though, that the Canadian government is lobbying against this policy, rather than cleaning up pollution in the tar sands," said Matt Horne, director of climate change for the Pembina Institute in British Columbia, which advocates clean energy solutions.
The State Department, which would have to issue a permit for the Keystone XL pipeline project because it crosses an international boundary, has indicated that it will decide on the proposal by the end of the year.

HEADLINE: Act II, Scene 1: A Wedding, With a Full Cast

BYLINE: JAMES BARRON


HIGHLIGHT: Jessie Austrian and Noah Brody play a married couple onstage, and now they will get to play one in real life. 

 BODY:
 Jessie Austrian and Noah Brody know how to play a married couple. They do it eight times a week. 
 They are actors. They are getting married again. This time for real. 
 And yes, the entire cast of their current play will have - how else to put this? - parts in the ceremony on Sunday. 
A co-director, Ben Steinfeld - who is also an artistic director, with the bride and groom, of the Fiasco Theater, a Manhattan-based troupe - will officiate. The other actors will be in the wedding party.
Then, on Tuesday, they will go back to work in the Fiasco production of Shakespeare's "Cymbeline" at the Barrow Street Theater. Ben Brantley, who reviewed it in The New York Times in January when it was playing next door to the fiasco that was Julie Taymor's "Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark," said Fiasco "was addressing and breezily overcoming many of the same problems that appear to be plaguing Ms. Taymor and company."
Mr. Brody had proposed in 2008. "We'd been unemployed for so long we figured we'd be unemployed when we planned our wedding a year in advance," she said. "And at the time, we knew a lot of people who were getting married and were happy to be engaged, but it seemed like the next moment they were stressed out planning the wedding. We wanted to stretch out the time we were engaged. We put a moratorium and said we weren't going to talk about planning a wedding for one year."
In fact, it took them two years to get around to actually doing the planning. That was before the two-week run at the New Victory Theater on West 42nd Street. Or before the Barrow Street Theater proposed an Off Broadway run starting in September.
"We told them Oct. 9 and something had to happen with a band and a caterer and a photographer" that had already been hired, Ms. Austrian said. "We were incredibly grateful that they were easygoing and generous and said they would give us the weekend off."
The production's press agent, Bruce Cohen, did some back-of-the-envelope calculations and said that canceling four performances - two on Saturday and two on Sunday - amounted to a $56,000 wedding present. But there are two footnotes to that.
"We are making up all four of those shows," Ms. Austrian said. "We made up one on Monday."
And, as Mr. Brody put it, "It's not $56,000 that we get to spend. That's really going to help knock down that grad school debt."
They accumulated it at Brown University. Ms. Austrian said they had been "flirting in a more innocent way" during Shakespeare's "Winter's Tale" before she and Mr. Steinfeld played a married couple in Harold Pinter's play "Old Times," with Mr. Brody directing.
"It's twisted and dark and very funny," Mr. Brody said. "Part of the power dynamic between the people is who gets to decide what really happened at any given time, and the answer is, the last person who spoke."
The next person who spoke was Ms. Austrian. "That's just what we happened to be working on when we got to know each other," she said.
 She did not have the last word here. Mr. Brody piped up: "At the same time I was also playing the lead in a play in which I was a psychotic murderer."
An unmarried psychotic murderer.
For their ceremony, there will be touches from other moments in the couple's careers besides "Cymbeline." Ms. Austrian's dress, for example, is being made by the Tony Award winner Martin Pakledinaz, whom she met when she made her Broadway debut in "Lend Me a Tenor."
On Monday, for their one-day honeymoon, Mr. Brody said that they would go to "a nice hotel and spa place where we'll just get to spend 24 hours basking in each other's eyes and getting massages and generally treating ourselves as if we actually have money."

HEADLINE: Santorum Calls Morality Crucial to Economic Success

BYLINE: SARAH WHEATON


HIGHLIGHT: Squarely in his element, Rick Santorum asserted himself as a moral leader and pitched his 0-0-0 economic plan at the Values Voter Summit. 

 BODY:
Squarely in his element, Rick Santorum delivered a confident assertion of the need for moral leadership in the political realm at the Values Voter Summit in Washington on Friday. His delivery - warm and buoyant, without a trace of fire and brimstone despite the sharply conservative message - was a reminder of why Mr. Santorum remains a force in Republican circles though he has been out of the Senate since Pennsylvanians voted him out in 2006.
"People don't understand how moral issues are absolutely essential for the economic success of this country," Mr. Santorum said. This is why policies should "nurture and support institution of marriage and fathers taking care of their children," he said, adding that as president, he would "fight in every state to make sure that marriage remains between one man and one woman."
"Our rights come from God - not any god, but the god of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob," Mr. Santorum said, drawing applause from the audience at the conservative Christian gathering.
Mr. Santorum pointed to the passage of a ban on late-term abortions, the Defense of Marriage Act and welfare reform during his years in Congress as evidence of his "track record of standing up and fighting those battles and winning those battles." 
He also presented a 0-0-0 economic plan (in contrast to Herman Cain's 9-9-9 plan for corporate, income and sales taxes). 
To increase blue-collar jobs in the United States, Mr. Santorum said he would impose a zero-percent tax rate on manufacturing and processing plants, charge no taxes on companies that return to the United States after investing abroad, and eliminate "every single regulation the Obama administration has put in place."
Perhaps more than any other presidential candidate, Mr. Santorum's family is central to his campaign pitch. He invited his wife, Karen, and several of the couple's seven children to join him on stage as he spoke about his opposition to abortion.
Mr. Santorum told the story of his 3-year-old daughter, Bella, who was born with a congenital disease that is often fatal within a year. In the White House, he said, "imagine the example of this quote disabled child being that light" to the nation.
He added, "It's by example that you lead."

HEADLINE: Has Globalization Helped India's Poor?

BYLINE: VIVEK DEHEJIA


HIGHLIGHT: The evidence, to date, is not conclusive. 

 BODY:
Has freer trade decreased or increased poverty and inequality in India? The debate has persisted, almost from the very beginning of India's embrace of the global economy in 1991.

Curiously, also exactly 20 years ago, Americans were engaged in a similar battle of ideas. Mapping its intellectual contours helps give us a fix on the current Indian situation.
Recall that then, just as may be unfolding now, the United States was gearing up for a presidential election which ultimately unseated an incumbent who had been hugely popular just a few years before.
At that time, the was over the merits of freer international trade, and specifically whether it could be blamed for the . Voters wondered whether the proposed North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), embraced by President George H.W. Bush, but initially shunned by then Gov. Bill Clinton, would hurt their job prospects.
Textbook provides the intellectual rationale for this view. The theory suggests that freer trade benefits the "abundant," but harms the "scarce," factors of production. In the United States, skilled workers and capital are relatively abundant, whereas in poorer countries it is unskilled workers who are in relatively abundant supply.
The fits the theory's predictions rather well: the wages of skilled workers and profits to capital have risen, while unskilled workers' wages have failed to keep pace, leading to a widening gap between rich and poor.
Often assumed, if not explicitly stated, in these early globalization debates was the idea that freer trade may be harmful for wages and inequality in rich countries such as the United States, but it would generally be beneficial for people in poorer countries such as Mexico or India.
Workers' wages in poorer countries, the theory went, should rise as a result of the embrace of freer trade, and as a corollary proposition, income inequality should fall.
The potentially contrary impact of globalization on rich and poor countries was certainly a theme sounded in influential writings of the time, such as "The Lexus and the Olive Tree: Understanding Globalization," by New York Times columnist Thomas L. Friedman.
But is that how things have played out?
Let's fast forward, to the current debates in India, for some answers.
A recent study by economists Pravin Krishna and Guru Sethupathy is perhaps the first to investigate the impact of trade liberalization on inequality using rigorous statistical techniques.
As Mr. Krishna explained to me via e-mail: "The bottom line conclusion ... is that while inequality appears to have gone up in the initial years following the start of the reforms (1994-2000), it has fallen again (between 2000-2005) to nearly the pre-reform levels."
Like the dog that didn't bark, the study's principal finding is a non-result: there is no systematic relationship between trade liberalization and inequality in India. Rather, a whopping 90 percent of inequality reflects differences at the level of individual households within states or within urban vs. rural areas, rather than between these groupings. And widening the lens from the household to the community, more than 60 percent of total inequality is found at the local level, within urban blocks and rural villages.
These highly localized roots of inequality have little to do with inter-state or rural-urban differences, to say nothing of trade or other international factors. Rather, they stem from factors that labor economists have long understood to be the drivers of inequality: education, work experience, family background, and, crucially in the Indian case, caste and ethnic differences.
Trade is, at best, a footnote to the tale of inequality in India.
On poverty, by contrast, some contend that the Indian experience confirms the optimistic prediction.
The economist and investment adviser Surjit Bhalla has been one of the most outspoken proponents of the view that, correctly measured, poverty has declined dramatically in India since 1991, and that much of the credit is due to the liberalization and globalization of the Indian economy.
By Mr. Bhalla's reckoning, only 11 percent of Indians are now poor, much below conventional estimates that place the poverty rate around 37 percent. Even if this is overly sanguine, many analysts agree that economic reform, of which integration into the global economy was a key element, has lifted millions of people out of poverty in India.
But the debate on the correct measure of poverty has flared up again recently in India, following a proposed cutoff for "below poverty line" households mooted by the country's planning commission, that many critics have argued is well below subsistence, and therefore would underestimate the number of poor people.
A more realistic definition of poverty would, in turn, suggest a more muted, if still positive, impact of liberalization on poverty reduction.
On balance, trade has had a beneficial impact on reducing poverty, albeit probably not as much as ardent free marketeers would argue. Equally, there seems to be no relationship between trade and inequality. Yet, according to economic theory, trade was supposed to have been good for both.
Taken together, these equivocal findings could be read as optimistic, or not, depending on your point of view.
As with the American debate of 20 years ago, the realities in India today are often subtler, and less sure, than partisan conviction on one side or the other might suggest. The debate, no doubt, will rage on.

Accepting a proposal from Democrats to increase taxes on incomes over $1 million, President Obama warned Congress that failure to pass his jobs bill would leave the tepid economic recovery vulnerable to dip back into recession, Jackie Calmes writes. With new unemployment figures this morning expected to show anemic job growth in September and the Senate scheduled to begin debate on legislation next week, the bill's prospects remain uncertain.
        
On Capitol Hill, Mr. Obama's calls to pass the jobs bill were echoedby Treasury Secretary Timothy F, Geithner as he testified before Senate and House panels about the deteriorating economic situation, Binyamin Appelbaum reports.
        
Behind the scenes, Republicans are grappling with how to keep the strict antitax pledges they made and still come to a compromise with Democrats on revising tax policy. Some G.O.P. members arebeginning to back away from the pledges, Jennifer Steinhauer reports.
        
The anticorporate proteststhat spread to Washington offer Mr. Obama an opportunity to command a movement with the potential to become the counterweight to the Tea Party, if he can harness it, Mark Landler writes.
        
During a news conference, Mr. Obama issued an oblique warning to Pakistan, saying he was concerned about ties between the country's intelligence service and anti-American militants in Afghanistan, Rick Gladstone reports.
        
The Obama administration is warming to the isolated government of Myanmaras the country shows sudden and surprising signs of change, which the White House wants to encourage, Steven Lee Myers and Thomas Fuller report.
        
The most sought-after uncommitted Republican donors and financiers are throwing their weight behind former Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts as the Republican presidential field firms up, and their support could prove critical to his efforts to wrest the nomination from his foremost rival, Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, Jeff Zeleny writes.
        
Mr. Obama plans to issue an executive order on Friday aimed at patching holes in the security frameworkfor handling classified information as the government seeks to prevent more scandals like those caused by WikiLeaks.
        
The National Academy of Sciences has recommended that the federal government explicitly define what services must be covered by policies created under the health care overhaul as millions of people prepare to purchase policies from new state-run insurance exchanges, Robert Pear writes.

HEADLINE: Republican Candidates Start to Engage on Foreign Policy

BYLINE: RICHARD W. STEVENSON


HIGHLIGHT: The primary campaign is already highlighting the lack of consensus within the party about the direction of United States foreign policy. 

 BODY:
Gov. Rick Perry appeared unprepared for a debate question last month about how he would respond if Pakistan's nuclear weapons fell into the hands of the Taliban. 
Representative Michele Bachmann suggested last week that the pro-democracy Arab Spring was a radical movement that had harmed the interests of the United States by removing Egypt's autocratic leader from power. And Mitt Romney sent shudders through the Republican foreign policy establishment in June when he seemed to support withdrawing from Afghanistan.
To anyone who has watched Republican politics closely over the last decade, the early stages of the presidential race have been striking for their lack of emphasis on foreign policy and national security issues. When those issues have come up, the positions taken by the candidates have been often vague, sometimes surprising and occasionally confused.
For better or worse, this presidential field so far sounds little like George W. Bush or John McCain, who between them were the dominant voices in their party on national security for a decade.
The candidates are only now starting to engage seriously on foreign policy. Mr. Romney is delivering an address to outline his policy on Friday. According to excerpts released by his campaign, Mr. Romney would conduct a review of troop levels in Afghanistan, put more money into missile defense and the Navy and, in an echo of President Obama as he ran for the White House, "strengthen and repair relationships" with allies. 
In his speech, he accuses Mr. Obama of an "eloquently justified surrender of world leadership" but has positive things to say about multilateralism.
"This is America's moment," Mr. Romney says in the speech. "We should embrace the challenge, not shrink from it, not crawl into an isolationist shell, not wave the white flag of surrender, nor give in to those who assert America's moment has passed."
Jon M. Huntsman Jr. will deliver his first big foreign policy address on Monday, building on his position that it is time to wind down the war in Afghanistan and focus more resources on rebuilding the nation at home. And as the start of the voting draws closer, all the candidates will face more scrutiny as prospective commanders in chief.
But the primary campaign is already highlighting the lack of consensus within the party about the direction of United States foreign policy as the nation begins moving past its post-9/11 posture. 
With budget deficits dominating the agenda, the debate is only beginning over how much the nation is willing and able to pay to project power around the world. With tensions running high between Israelis and Palestinians, there is no agreement on how to proceed in the Middle East. With China growing in global strength, there is no clear strategy for recapturing American economic leadership.
With so much up in the air, adherents of all three major strains of conservative foreign policy thinking are jockeying for influence and the chance to steer Republicans for the next generation.
There are the realists, establishment Republicans who tend to be viewed as pragmatists, willing to work within alliances but focused on American interests. There are the neoconservatives, hawkish, strongly pro-Israel, happy to act unilaterally and project values as well as power based on their vision of American exceptionalism. 
And perhaps most important, this time around there are the newly emergent grassroots populists and Tea Party adherents who are exerting additional pulls on foreign policy. If not uniformly isolationist, they are suspicious of international institutions. They often overlap with the neoconservatives in their support for Israel, but can also be deeply suspicious of foreign entanglements and see constraints on the projection of American power for cost reasons if nothing else. 
The cross-currents from that philosophical contest - and the relative inexperience of the presidential field on national security - are evident in the somewhat inchoate stances coming from the candidates in the campaign's early stages.
Neither Mr. Perry nor Mr. Romney has so far articulated a detailed policy on Afghanistan. Both of them suggested at one point that it is time for the troops to come home, but then sent out word that they do not mean they would actually withdraw large numbers of troops right away.
Meanwhile, Mr. Hunstman, who as a former ambassador to China has the most direct claim in the field to foreign policy experience, has taken a clear position against continuing a high-intensity war. That is a position that puts him directly at odds with the party's hawks, and not that far from Ron Paul, whose libertarian views line up with the neo-isolationist strain within the Tea Party.
Mr. Romney, who is otherwise an advocate of free trade, has at times employed a strikingly populist tone when it comes to China, and has promised unilateral action to impose punitive duties if China does not alter its currency policy. In doing so, he has given heartburn to defenders of free trade and highlighted how anger about the weak economy and its perceived villains is coursing through the right as well as the left.
Mr. Perry, under attack from many conservatives for some aspects of his record on illegal immigration, has floated the possibility that the United States might someday send troops into Mexico to help deal with the drug war there. 
Campaigns are not just for voters. They are a chance for the candidates to grow as well - and the foreign policy campaign is just getting underway.

HEADLINE: Commodity Prices Redux

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Back to 2007 levels. 

 BODY:
Remember commodity prices? Not too long ago, the usual suspects were pointing to rising commodity prices as evidence that runaway inflation was just around the corner. Commodity prices were Exhibit A in claims that Bernanke was "debasing the dollar"; Paul Ryan called for monetary policy that would stabilize the price of a basket of commodities (and therefore require deflation in America whenever China experienced a boom, but hey, never mind).
So it's instructive to look at what has happened to commodity prices recently. Actually, here's the Thomson Reuters index over the past 5 years:
Commodity prices have fallen sharply this year. They're still above their levels at the bottom of the global slump, but that's hardly surprising. What may be surprising is that they're just about where they were in 2007, before the big 2007-2008 runup. Over a 4-year period, then, it turns out that the Bernanke Fed has just about stabilized commodity prices -- not that this is a good goal, but it is what has happened.
So will people like Ryan admit that the dollar has not in fact been debased? Will they look at the recent plunge and conclude that maybe we need more expansion, not tightening? Will they admit that their favorite "experts", who saw the commodity bulge last year as a harbinger of hyperinflation, don't know anything? Is the Pope Jewish?

HEADLINE: Leading Off: That Wasn't Supposed to Happen

BYLINE: LYNN ZINSER


HIGHLIGHT: Tigers rewrite the script in toppling the Yankees in the Bronx, while the National League's two Game 5s rate differently on the panic meter and the White Sox raise more eyebrows by hiring Manager Robin Ventura. 

 BODY:
For a while, the Tigers-as-Yankee-slayers became a plausible idea. The Tigers have the best pitcher in baseball, a shrewd manager, cool old-school uniforms. But when they botched a chance to win the American League division series at home in Game 4, a trip to the Bronx for Game 5 Thursday night was a no-hoper. You don't let the Yankees off the mat and win. You just don't.
Except when you do.
To the idea that Game 5 was another Yankee coronation, Tigers Manager Jim Leyland offered one of his trademark scowls. He then maneuvered his team out of every jam and watched as the Big Potato (Jose Valverde) struck out the Big Contract (Alex Rodriguez) to commence the unlikeliest celebration you could reach on a B train.
Yes, this giddy band of Tigers pulled off the improbable, writes Tim Brown on Yahoo.com, and silenced the big Yankee Machine. For much of the series, as Danny Knobler writes on CBSSports.com, only the Tigers actually believed it could happen, but they were the important ones. Jerry Crasnick of ESPN.com delineates just how stacked this situation was for the Yankees and yet, Leyland was the coolest customer even in the most tense moments, writes Jon Paul Morosi on Foxsports.com. And it is in those moments when history gets written, writes Mitch Albom in the Detroit Free Press.

In Detroit, this means planning for an A.L. Championship series against Texas, while in New York it signals the start of recrimination season. This is often juicer than the actual season.
We can begin with the annual debate over Manager Joe Girardi, whose strategy to stick with the same lineup while juggling pitchers like flaming torches seemed unsophisticated when compared to Leyland's deft moves, writes Steve Gardner in USA Today. Then we can move onto whether the patchwork rotation or flailing sluggers were more to blame. Certainly it didn't help A-Rod's cause that he ended a second straight postseason run by striking out on the final out and his futility in this series makes his mammoth contract seem even more onerous, writes John Harper in The Daily News. Derek Jeter was also among those who let huge opportunities pass, including the tantalizing warning-track shot in the eighth inning, writes Mike Vaccaro in The Post. But it was the Yankees' rotation that was exposed in this series, writes Ken Rosenthal on Foxsports.com, and would have been a bigger mess had the Yankees advanced. Now, they are left to ponder what C.C. Sabathia will do with the option years on his contract.
Now the playoffs move on to the other two Game 5s on the docket in the National League Friday night. The Phillies are trying to muster Yankees-level dynasty-in-trouble panic, with Paul Hagan of the Philadelphia Daily News writing this is the most important game in Phillies history, which does seem a bit extreme because, like the Yankees, win or lose they will be back next year with another expensive, overstocked lineup. The Brewers have no such guarantees, however, and play Friday night's Game 5 against Arizona knowing that it might be the end of Prince Fielder's run in Milwaukee.
Baseball also had news in the nonplayoff division from a reliable source, the White Sox. They used Thursday to make the head-swinging move of snatching Robin Ventura away from his high school coaching jobto be their new manager. It will be, writes Scott Miller on CBSSports.com, either a brilliant move or a disaster, while Rick Morrissey of the Chicago Sun-Times marvels at the White Sox' "pre-emptive strike against all the teams that were dying to hire a guy with no experience." Well said.
The other sports offered a few distractions from baseball fever, but soccer did so in a way it really hadn't planned on, with Wayne Rooney's father and uncle arrested for an alleged betting scam. Golf was hoping for happier tidings from Tiger Woods's latest return to action (we believe this is comeback No. 47 since his career-sinking scandal, but who's counting?) but Woods offered another hacker-esque round at the Frys.com Open.
We recommend ignoring the N.B.A. until it comes to its senses with this lockout business, but Adrian Wojnarowski of Yahoo.com makes a compelling case for admiring Kevin Garnett's role for the players' union. Do not, however, feel too badly for the cities absorbing a huge economic blow if the season doesn't happen because, according to this Slate.com analysis, there is no huge economic blow.
New York's economy probably won't take much of a hit from the Yankees loss either. No, it took that one right in the ego.

HIGHLIGHT: What we're reading this weekend. 

 BODY:
We're keeping tabs on Denmark's "fat tax" (which took effect last Saturday). Here are my thoughts, and those of the Washington Post. Also, New Zealand is in the grip of an obesity epidemic, but health minister Tony Ryall has ruled out a fat tax, citing the economy.
Here is a great "back and forth" between Anna Lappe and Hugh Whaley (General Manager of the U.S. Farmers and Ranchers Alliance) about what the USFRA actually stands for.
Want to tell the FDA to label genetically engineered food? Right this way. (As far as the back-story goes, campaign-trail-Obama pledged to label GE foods "because Americans should know what they're buying." Needless to say, President Obama has not yet come through.)
Add a new word to your vocabulary: Bio-piracy. India announced last month it is pursuing charges against Monsanto for "stealing" an indigenous crop -- eggplant -- and using it to create a modified version without permission, a violation of India's decade-old Biological Diversity Act. It's the first prosecution of a company for the act of "biopiracy" in the country, and possibly the world.
It's an uphill battle for healthy vending machines in schools (not surprisingly, kids still prefer the stuff that comes out of mainstream vending machines). Closely related: new obesity reports blame food marketing. A possible solution? Multi-colored novelty carrots.
American farmers seeking to replace migrant laborers with local (jobless) workers often find there aren't enough locals willing to work their fields.
In California's Central Valley, where much of our produce is grown, the water is too contaminated with nitrates for locals to drink. Related: avocados, the second-largest crop in Florida, are being threatened by beetles the size of a date-stamp on a penny.
A Labor Department study found that only 10 percent of people the Labor Department personally trained for green jobs have found work.
PETA called a come-hither photograph of a skinned chicken that appeared in the Times "necrophilia." The article was about chicken skin used as a delicacy in cooking. Here's the backstory.
Amazing cultural intersection here: Sesame Street is debuting a food-insecure muppet named Lily in a one-hour special featuring country singer Brad Paisley, and sponsored by Wal-Mart.
A new report says that unless we see some major technological innovation, the U.S. probably won't reach its long-term goal for advanced biofuels consumption.
A study in the Journal of Applied Psychology sampled 127 college students and found that men eat more around women than they do around other men. Women, perhaps not surprisingly, ate less around their male counterparts than they did in the company of other women. I kind of love this.
The first chef in Italy to receive three Michelin stars is now working for McDonald's, creating two "gourmet" hamburgers and a tiramisu. Wow.

HEADLINE: In Foreign Policy Speech, Romney Calls for an 'American Century'

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER


HIGHLIGHT: "If you do not want America to be the strongest nation on Earth, I am not your president," Mitt Romney said. 

 BODY:
CHARLESTON, S.C. - Standing before an audience of crisply-clad, closely-shorn cadets, Mitt Romney delivered his foreign policy vision at The Citadel on Friday, calling for a strengthened military and economy to lead the country into what he called "an American Century," while also accusing President Obama of weakening the nation's image around the world.
"This is America's moment," said Mr. Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts. "We should embrace the challenge, not shrink from it, not crawl into an isolationist shell, not wave the white flag of surrender, nor give in to those who assert America's time has passed."
Take a hard swipe at Mr. Obama, he added: "An eloquently justified surrender of world leadership is still surrender."
"If you do not want America to be the strongest nation on Earth, I am not your president," he said, as a murmur rippled through the applause-filled room. "You have that president today."
In a statement, the Obama campaign dismissed the speech: "Governor Romney raised real questions about his capacity to lead this country and wage the fight against terrorism. He didn't outline a strategy to strengthen America's security and promote our interests and didn't even identify defeating Al Qaeda as a goal. President Obama has degraded Al Qaeda and dealt huge blows to its leadership, including eliminating Osama Bin Laden, ended the war in Iraq, promoted our security in Afghanistan while winding down our commitment in a responsible way and strengthened American leadership around the world. Governor Romney proves once again that he is willing to say anything, regardless of the facts, to get elected."
Mr. Romney, whose vision generally called for a strong and resolute America to lead the world, also outlined eight specific actions he would take in his first 100 days if elected president. These include strengthening naval power by increasing shipbuilding; improving relationships with the country's close allies like Israel, Britain and Mexico; increasing deterrent measures to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon; revisiting a missile-defense system; reviewing the country's strategy in Afghanistan; and starting a campaign for economic opportunity in Latin America. (When he unveiled his economic plan in Nevada last month, he also offered the 10 actions he would take on his first day in the Oval Office).
Mr. Romney said he would use the "full spectrum of hard and soft power to influence events before they erupt into conflict." Though much of the Republican field has yet to articulate their specific foreign policy views, Mr. Romney tried to differentiate himself from some candidates - as well as some members of the Republican Congress - who have advocated a more isolationist strain of foreign policy. 
"If America is the undisputed leader of the world, it reduces our need to police a more chaotic world," Mr. Romney said. "But know this: While America should work with other nations, we always reserve the right to act alone to protect our vital national interest."
Mr. Romney began his speech by outlining what he painted as a potentially frightening picture of the world four years from today - a nuclear Iran, an isolated Israel, a resurgent Taliban, a rising China opting to "go down a darker path" - before saying that he offered a "very different vision of America's role in the world and America's destiny."
"In an American Century, America has the strongest economy and the strongest military in the world," he said. "In an American Century, America leads the free world and the free world leads the entire world." 
Mr. Romney and his aides were eager to keep the focus on Mr. Obama, contrasting Mr. Romney's plan with a president who, they said, has accepted the view that America is on the decline.
"American strength rises from a strong economy, a strong defense, and the enduring strength of our strong values," he said. "Unfortunately, under this president, all three of those elements have been weakened."
Romney aides did say, however, that Mr. Romney's vision differs from former President George W. Bush's foreign policy on its approach to Latin America, adding that both Mr. Bush and Mr. Obama did not make Latin America a priority.
"I will launch a campaign to advance economic opportunity in Latin America, and contrast the benefits of democracy, free trade and free enterprise against the material and moral bankruptcy of the Venezuelan and Cuban model," Mr. Romney said.
Though Mr. Romney did not offer any specifics on Afghanistan, he said he would "order a full review of our transition to the Afghan military," listen to the generals in the field and make his decision "free from politics." Mr. Obama had previously announced a complete transition date of 2014, and has begun withdrawing troops from the country at rate that is both faster and deeper than some of his military commanders had recommended.
The speech, Mr. Romney's first major foray in foreign policy, was carefully choreographed, from the "Top Gun" music that played as the cadets filed in to the young staffers who worked late into the night to make sure the "Believe in America" banner was hung just right. Aides positioned the lecturn so that Mr. Romney spoke against a backdrop of cadets in the gray uniforms.
Speaking in advance of Friday's address, Mr. Romney briefly delved into foreign policy Thursday aboard the U.S.S. Yorktown, a decommissioned World War II aircraft carrier in Mt. Pleasant, S.C., from which Mr. Romney has spoken before and from which Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts began his presidential bid in 2004. 
Addressing a small group of veterans, he called for increasing the Pentagon's budget - moving noncombat spending to 4 percent of the gross domestic product from 3.8 percent, and increasing the ranks of active duty personnel by about 100,000.

HEADLINE: Disney's Iger to Step Down in 2015

BYLINE: BROOKS BARNES


HIGHLIGHT: The company's chief executive has signed a contract to stay on in that job until March 2015, then leave the company completely in June of 2016. Disney says it is trying to lock up Mr. Iger for as long as possible. 

 BODY:
 1:52 p.m. | Updated LOS ANGELES - Robert A. Iger, Disney's chief executive, has signed a new contract that keeps him atop the world's largest entertainment company until March 2015. But he will then move to a lesser role for a year before leaving Disney entirely, the company said Friday.
 Under the new contract - positioned by the Walt Disney Company as an effort to lock Mr. Iger up for as long as possible - Mr. Iger will gain the title of chairman in March of next year, succeeding John E. Pepper, who will step down after having served four years in that job. In March of 2015, Disney's board will name a new chief executive and Mr. Iger will transition to executive chairman.
Mr. Iger will then leave Disney on June 30, 2016. He started his entertainment career at Disney-owned ABC in 1974. Mr. Iger will be 65 upon his departure; Disney's mandatory retirement age for board members is 74.
Since chief executives are typically pulled from their corner offices kicking and screaming, attention is likely to focus on what Mr. Iger has planned for his long-term future. It has long been speculated that he has political ambitions, possibly in New York, where he grew up and worked early in his career.
Friday's announcement also raises the question of succession. Disney likes to promote from within and at the moment there appear to be two primary candidates to replace Mr. Iger: James A. Rasulo, Disney's chief financial officer and former theme park chairman; and Thomas O. Staggs, currently theme park chairman and formerly C.F.O. (The two men switched roles at Mr. Iger's behest in 2009.
Since becoming Disney's chief executive in 2005, Mr. Iger has mostly kept the company sailing smoothly through a cluster of storms, chiefly the recession, which hammered television advertising sales and threatened the company's theme parks.
Despite some messy quarters, Disney's results for the last fiscal year were quite strong: Net income rose 20 percent, to $3.96 billion, from $3.31 billion. The company has outperformed the Standard & Poor's index by five times since Mr. Iger took over.
Mr. Iger's accomplishments include the acquisitions of Pixar Animation Studios and Marvel Entertainment and securing approval from the Chinese government (after decades of efforts) for a sprawling theme park in Shanghai. ESPN, a Disney unit, continues to surge and other cable properties, notably ABC Family, have also picked up considerable momentum. 
But there is plenty of work still to do. Disney has been inconsistent when it comes to adapting to new technology - on the one had becoming the first media company to make television shows available on iTunes and on the other struggling to turn around its unprofitable online division. ABC needs to find new hits, and a turnaround at Disney's movie studio is still a work in progress.
The new contract, which replaces one that still had two years before expiring, contains notable changes to Mr. Iger's compensation. His base annual salary will increase by 25 percent, to $2.5 million, with a higher annual bonus target. But unlike his previous contract, this one does not provide an upfront stock-option grant as an additional signing bonus; the previous contract provided one valued at $25 million. 
Mr. Iger's salary and bonus last year was about $16 million. His total compensation, including equity awards, was about $28 million, according to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

HEADLINE: For Women Bankers, a Subdued Awards Party

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: American Banker Magazine's awards gala for the top women in banking was more subdued than in previous years, reflecting the Wall Street protests and the death of Steven P. Jobs. 

 BODY:
In most years, American Banker's Most Powerful Women in Banking awards gala is a time for the finance industry's top female executives to dress up and let their hair down a little. 
In years past, award winners' speeches included mentions of the following: Spanx; fourth husbands; and fear of one's own children. (Actually, that was all in one winner's speech, but never mind.)
But this year, while the glittering dresses and red carpet entrance remained, the gala was a bit more subdued. It was perhaps inevitable, as the twin shadows of the protests on Wall Street's doorstep and the death of Apple's Steven P. Jobs loomed over the event.
Which is not to say that the party, on its ninth anniversary, was glum. Nearly 600 attendees in black tie streamed into the Waldorf-Astoria in midtown Manhattan, settling down to a candlelight dinner in the hotel's Astor Salon. And more than a few tables -- Capital One, Fifth Third and Citizens Financial among them -- erupted in cheers for their own winners when their names were called.
The music, courtesy of a live band, included songs whose titles included the words "girl" or "woman." DealBook's personal favorite: "Girl, You'll Be a Woman Soon," which we'll imagine was the Urge Overkill cover version. 
Several boldface names, for finance at least, attended as well: Mary Callahan Erdoes, the head of JPMorgan Chase's asset management arm and the seventh-most-powerful woman in banking; David Nelms, Discover Financial Services's chief executive; Gerald Hassell, the newly minted head of Bank of New York Mellon; Kenneth D. Moelis, the founder of Moelis & Company; and Carla Harris, a senior Morgan Stanley executive and the 17th-most-powerful woman in finance.
Karen Peetz, the chief executive of Bank of New York Mellon's financial markets and treasury services unit and this year's most powerful woman in banking, brought her mother, Jean Bretherick. "I'm very proud of her," Ms. Bretherick said of her daughter.
An unexpected guest also made an appearance: Sallie L. Krawcheck, who was pushed out of Bank of America early last month. Normally among the gala's most prominent attendees, Ms. Krawcheck kept a low profile at Thursday's event. When she strode onstage to collect her award as the 18th-most-powerful woman in finance, American Banker's editor in chief, Barbara Rehm, made it a point of not mentioning Ms. Krawcheck's suddenly former employer.
There was an actual celebrity as well, in the person of Arianna Huffington, the keynote speaker.
Still, there were signs that this year's event would be just a little less fesitve than usual. Bank of America's two honorees, Anne M. Finucane, the bank's global marketing and strategy officer, and Barbara Desoer, the home loans president, were not around. And gone were the $100 gift cards that served as table presents from one of the event's main sponsors, Discover Financial. (Instead, the company presented large picture frames that guests could use for their red-carpet portraits.)
Yet the spirit of the night was most reflected in speeches given during the awards ceremony. As expected, all who spoke both praised the progress women had made in climbing up banking's executive ladder; the cover line of American Banker Magazine's latest issue was "Hail to the Chiefs."
And several speakers invoked Mr. Jobs, and more specifically his 2005 commencement speech at Stanford imploring graduates to be fearless, and not fear death or change. 
But both Ms. Huffington and Heidi G. Miller, the outgoing president of JPMorgan Chase's international operations, asked the night's guests to remember the economic malaise gripping the American economy.
After espousing the value of naps -- "Have you ever wondered whether some Lehman Brothers people were sleep-deprived?" -- and praising Barclays for lending her money when she began her career, Ms. Huffington turned to the faltering economy. In inimitable Huffington-ese, she spoke of the difficulties many Americans are facing.
"I don't like seeing America behind France in upward mobility," she said. "It'd be like France being behind America in croissants and afternoon sex."
More seriously, she added, "We can improve the bottom line and improve the world as well."
Then came Ms. Miller, who took the stage to a standing ovation. She began by calling wealth and power more ephemeral than helping elevate women in the work place, and proudly proclaimed herself a product of affirmative action hiring. 
Among the most important things the night's attendees could do, she said, was fight for those less privileged, be they new female employees or those society is leaving behind. Ms. Miller rattled off statistics underscoring the pain driving outcries like Occupy Wall Street: about 16.7 percent of blacks and 11.3 percent of Hispanics were unemployed, for instance. 
"This is a level of pain we can't and shouldn't ignore," she said, adding that banks and bankers, to ensure that they do not stay the butt of jokes, "have to be seen as helping the problem and not just creating the problem."

HEADLINE: The Occupy Wall Street Quiz

BYLINE: PETER CATAPANO


HIGHLIGHT: After weeks of silence, politicians finally took sides on the Wall Street protests. 

 BODY:
All of a sudden everybody's got an opinion.
Last week, amid loud complaints that the Occupy Wall Street protests were being unfairly ignored by the media and the nation's politicians, the media and the nation's politicians started paying attention. And so the gnat-like media buzz of late September quickly became the barking dog of October, and now - well the whole thing has gone completely honey badger. The honey badger, as you may know, is known for its relentless nature, and in this case seems to have dragged an elephant into the room. Thus it has become a matter that politicians, including several presidential candidates, and public figures of all species could no longer ignore. In the past few days, they have stepped up and made their views known.
Want to know who said what this week about the protests? Here's a little Occupy Wall Street quiz.

1. "I for one am increasingly concerned about the growing mobs occupying Wall Street and the other cities across the country."
2. "I think it expresses the frustration the American people feel."
3. "They blame, with some justification, the problems in the financial sector for getting us into this mess, and they're dissatisfied with the policy response here in Washington. And at some level, I can't blame them."
4. "Don't blame Wall Street, don't blame the big banks, if you don't have a job and you're not rich, blame yourself!"
5. "We are the 1 percent."
6. "God bless them for their spontaneity. It's young, it's spontaneous, it's focused and it's going to be effective."
7. "This is like the Tea Party - only it's real. By the time this is over, it will make the Tea Party look like ... a tea party."
8. "I think it's dangerous, this class warfare."
9. "What they're trying to do is take away the jobs of people working in the city, take away the tax base that we have."
10. "I'm very, very understanding of where they're coming from."
(Answers: 1. Eric Cantor, House Majority Leader 2. President Barack Obama 3. Ben Bernanke, Chairman of the Federal Reserve 4. Herman Cain, Republican presidential candidate 5. Signs taped to the windows on the eighth floor of Chicago's Board of Trade building. 6. Nancy Pelosi, House Minority Leader 7. Russ Feingold, former Democratic senator 8. Mitt Romney, Republican presidential candidate 9. New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg 10. Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts)
If you look at the results, you'll see a sort of historically familiar pattern: Democrats sympathizing with the protestors, Republicans railing against them and Michael Bloomberg worrying about his city's tax base.
As The Hill and many other outlets reported, and our little quiz shows, the week brought a torrent of quips from congressional Democrats in support of the protestors, and another torrent from the right that vilified them. So is this turning into yet another red and blue battleground? Another gridiron for the clear cut ideological split between the two parties?
It's complicated. 
The Times's Mark Landler considered specifically the political implications for the president, who can now see the protests from his front door. Opportunity or threat? Like I said, it's complicated:
Anti-Wall Street protesters marched past the gates of the White House on Thursday, bringing their message of economic injustice to the capital and posing an opportunity, but also a threat, to President Obama, who presents himself as a fervent defender of the middle class. ...
To hear some Democratic analysts tell it, the mushrooming protests could be the start of a populist movement on the left that counterbalances the surge of the Tea Party on the right, and closes what some Democrats fear is an "enthusiasm gap" between their party and Republicans in the 2012 election.
But that assumes the president is able to win the support of these insurgents, rather than be shunned by them.
Mr. Obama, in a series of recent hard-edged speeches around the country, has channeled many of the grievances of the movement known as Occupy Wall Street deepening economic inequity, a tax code that gives breaks to the wealthy and corporate interests and banks that profit from hidden consumer fees.
Yet the president also oversaw a bailout of those banks, appointed a Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, who is viewed by the protesters as a shill for Wall Street and pushed a reform of the financial industry that many in the movement condemn as shamefully inadequate in curbing its excesses.
Like Landler, Josh Kraushaar at National Journal also notes Obama's newfound "populist" stance, and deems it a risky tactic for the president's re-election:
Liberals have long argued that a message calling for the wealthy to pay their fair share is broadly popular-and indeed, most polls show voters support abstract proposals calling for higher taxes on the rich. But it's rarely worked in practice. If taxes were raised as part of a comprehensive economic plan raising revenues and cutting spending, that's one thing. As part of a political argument designed to mobilize the base for his reelection campaign, it's bound to be received less warmly.
Others have identified Geithner as a flashpoint figure, the key player in Obama's administration who would serve as a target for Republicans and protestors alike:
Joseph Cannon at his blog Cannonfire poses this challenge: "If you are part of the movement, ask yourself: Do you truly want to gain power - to get things done - or do you just want to complain? In my experience, most leftwingers tend to view the exercise of power as a form of bad taste. Yes, power does corrupt - but without it, what can be accomplished?" Then: "I propose that the OWS forces make a muscle and land a solid initial punch, aimed at a specific target. Timothy Geithner. The Secretary of the Treasury must go."
Among his six reasons for the wisdom of this tactic, are these two:
Forcing Obama to take an unwelcome step establishes once and for all that the OWS movement is not a stalking horse for the Obama campaign. It says to the world: "We don't work for this president. Either he starts working for us, or we'll find someone who will." ...
Demanding that Obama fire Geithner forces the president to make a choice. Right now, he's trying to square the circle, solidifying the base while asking the Wall Streeters for cash. Obama can have one or the other but not both.
Not surprisingly, many on the right squirmed to find the Tea Party drawn into the discussion. Among them was Donald Douglas at American Power, who wrote, "The comparison between Occupy Wall Street and the tea parties is bogus, of course." He continued:
And it's frankly obscene that folks think Obama should benefit politically from these protests. The White House has been in bed with Wall Street. The dilemma for the Democrats is how they can channel the protests against the Republicans without getting caught up in a generalized anti-government tsunami in 2012. As was clear at the press conference yesterday, the president will basically lie through his teeth, blaming the economic crisis on his predecessor and waging a morally bankrupt class war on the high-income earners.
Rich Lowry at National Review also scoffs at the comparison: "The Tea Party had such an impact because it had a better claim on the middle of America than its adversaries. It wrapped itself in our history and patriotic trappings. It plugged in to the political system and changed the course of the country in the 2010 elections. The Left went from denying it, to ridiculing it, to envying it.
"Occupy Wall Street is not a real answer. It is both more self-involved and more ambitious than the Tea Party. It represents an ill-defined, free-floating radicalism. Its fuzzy endpoint is a "revolution" no one can precisely describe, but the thrust of which is overturning our system of capitalism as we know it."
The president wasn't the only one getting called out by commentators for their positions on the protests. Of the many who came forward this week, Cantor came under particular scrutiny. Steve Benen at Political Animal offered a withering view of Cantor's "mob" statement:
At this point two years ago, Republicans quickly became outraged if Democrats dared to criticize so-called "Tea Party" activists. After all, how could Dems have the audacity to disparage law-abiding Americans speaking out against abuses that offend them? How could Democrats have the gall to condemn sincere patriots who want to have their voices heard?
Two years later, Cantor is entirely comfortable chastising Americans who disagree with his failed, regressive economic vision as a "mob." How tolerant of him.
But just as important is this notion that progressive activists are "pitting of Americans against Americans." I'm not sure what that means, exactly, but I suspect the oft-confused Majority Leader believes it's divisive to support economic justice, to demand tax fairness, and to expect responsible corporate conduct.
The New Republic's Jonathan Cohn had a relatively circumspect view of the protests and the ensuing political turf battles - probably a reasonable reaction, given that the movement is likely to be around for a while. Cohn writes, "This movement could run out of gas or take what I would consider a wrong turn. It could, for example, inflame tensions between blue collar and white collar Americans, rather than improving solidarity between them. It could also become captive to its fringe elements. For now, though, I'm happy to see people getting organized to promote a left-of-center economic agenda, however vague its agenda - and however uncertain its future."
Uncertain future? Honey badger don't care.

HEADLINE: Podcast: Steve Jobs, Unemployment and Patriotic Spending

BYLINE: JEFF SOMMER


HIGHLIGHT: A look at the latest Weekend Business podcast, and a listen. 

 BODY:
The death of Steve Jobs has set off a global outpouring of tributes rarely seen for a business figure. What made him so special?
John Markoff and Steve Lohr, two veteran reporters, covered him for many years, and both knew him well. In the new Weekend Business podcast, they describe him as singularly passionate and focused, a leader who demanded dedication from those around him and would not tolerate mediocrity. He thought of himself as a "technology leader," says Mr. Markoff, who wrote Mr. Jobs's obituary for The Times. While Mr. Jobs was not a computer programmer or a designer in the formal sense, he was superb in guiding others and in imagining and shaping projects, Mr. Lohr says, elaborating on arguments he makes in a column in Sunday Business.
The unemployment rate remained at 9.1 percent in September, according to the Labor Department report on Friday, with too few jobs produced to budge that rate, as Motoko Rich says in a separate conversation in the podcast. The Economic Cycle Research Institute is forecasting a new recession, the focus of my Strategies column in Sunday Business, but Ms. Rich says that the latest jobs report suggests that while the economy is weak, it's not contracting at the moment.
Richard Thaler, the University of Chicago economist, says fear and anxiety have caused many corporations and individuals to hold back on spending. He advocates "self-interested patriotism," that is, carefully planned spending on labor-intensive projects by businesses and people who can afford to do so. Mr. Thaler elaborates on this approach in the Economic View column in Sunday Business.

And David Gillen and David Segal discuss the filming of food commercials, the subject of Mr. Segal's cover article in Sunday Business.
You can find specific segments of the podcast at these junctures: Steve Lohr and John Markoff on Steve Jobs (31:12); news headlines and Motoko Rich on unemployment (20:57); David Segal on food commercials (14:57); Richard Thaler (6:54); the week ahead (1:20).

HEADLINE: Perry Disagrees With Supporter's Comment on Mormon Church

BYLINE: JEFF ZELENY


HIGHLIGHT: As he left the room at the Johnson County Republican Dinner here, Mr. Perry was asked by a reporter whether he agreed with the comments of Mr. Jeffress about the Mormon Church being a cult. "No," he replied. 

 BODY:
TIFFIN, Iowa - Gov. Rick Perry of Texas said Friday night that he does not believe the Mormon Church is a cult, but he declined to answer questions about a remark from a Texas pastor who criticized the religion of Mitt Romney and declared that he "is not a Christian."
 At the first stop on a weekend campaign visit to Iowa, Mr. Perry did not address the matter that flared up earlier in the day at the Values Voter Summit in Washington, when the pastor, Robert Jeffress of Dallas, raised pointed questions about Mr. Romney's faith.
In a 15-minute speech and during a question-and-answer session with voters, Mr. Perry promoted his economic message, recited his record on securing the border with Mexico and asked Republican voters to keep an open mind about his candidacy. 
"Three months to go until the Iowa caucuses," Mr. Perry said. "Pundits don't choose presidents, the people of Iowa do."
As he left the room at the Johnson County Republican Dinner here, Mr. Perry was asked by a reporter whether he agreed with the comments of Mr. Jeffress about the Mormon Church being a cult. 
"No," he replied. 
Asked by another reporter whether he repudiated the remarks, he said, "I've already answered your question." 
With that, aides ushered Mr. Perry away from reporters and out of the room. His visit continues on Saturday with three stops in northwestern Iowa.

HEADLINE: Big Ticket | Sold for $25,000,000

BYLINE: SARAH KERSHAW


HIGHLIGHT: Paul G. Allen, a founder of Microsoft, bought the co-op at 4 East 66th Street. 

 BODY:
The $25 million sale of a penthouse in an East Side co-op to Paul G. Allen, a founder of the Microsoft Corporation, was the highest of the week, according to city property records.
Mr. Allen bought the penthouse at 4 East 66th Street, also known as 845 Fifth Avenue, from Angela Thompson, the widow of Wade F .B. Thompson, who made Airstream, the travel trailer builder, a wildly successful company. He died in November 2009. The records show that the penthouse was transferred to her in March.
She then sold it to Mr. Allen, who owns another apartment in the 12-story building and whose fortune is estimated at around $13 billion. The property was not listed with a broker. Mr. Allen recently published a memoir, "Idea Man" (Portfolio Hardcover), in which he recounts a stormy relationship with his business partner,
Bill Gates, particularly in the early days of their creation of Microsoft.
Big Ticket includes closed deals from the previous week, ending Wednesday.

HEADLINE: After a Rating Downgrade, U.S. Treasuries Turn a Profit

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
TWO months ago, Standard & Poor's downgraded the bond rating of the United States government. So far, at least, the move has done wonders for investors in the very bonds that the rating agency disparaged. 
The rating downgrade, along with continued turmoil in European markets and fears that the United States might be entering a new recession, caused a flight to safety among investors. And, notwithstanding the agency's opinion, money flooded into Treasuries and the demand for American dollars grew.
Since then, Treasury bonds have been one of the few investments that have produced good profits. As can be seen from the accompanying charts, an investor in long-term Treasuries would have earned a double-digit return, counting the small interest earned and the larger capital gains from rising prices. Shorter-term Treasuries have also rallied, although by smaller amounts.
When S.& P. cut the United States' rating from AAA to a still-high AA+, it went out of its way to praise France, which retains a AAA rating. Investors in long-term French bonds have not done badly over the period, with a gain of nearly 4 percent, measured in euros, since the S.& P. move. Unfortunately, however, the weakness of the euro has more than offset that return.
Among the world's major currencies, the dollar has been nearly the strongest since the downgrade. Only the Japanese yen has outpaced it, and that by a small amount. The Chinese renminbi, whose value is set by China and allowed to rise gradually against the dollar, is also up, but that would have been true no matter what happened in other markets.
If the Chinese currency did trade freely, it would no doubt be much higher than it is, but it too might have had a bad two months. Many currencies from emerging markets had been strong until recently, in part because foreign investors were buying them to invest in their stock markets. But it appears some investors are fleeing those markets as part of the flight to safety.
Both the Korean and Indian stock markets are down significantly in local currencies, and their currencies have depreciated against the dollar. In Brazil, the stock market came close to holding its own, so long as you look at local prices. But the real has lost about a tenth of its value, so the performance in international terms has been poor.
China's stock market has been among the worst in the world, losing nearly a fifth of its value over those two months. The American market, by contrast, has been among the best after adjusting for currency movements.
It is a feature of the modern world that many countries, less concerned about the loss of buying power for their own citizens, welcome weak currencies, hoping that will help their exporters. As a result, the recent rise of the dollar has itself been a cause of worry in the United States.

GRAPHIC: CHARTS: Please Do It Again, S. & P.: Since Standard & Poor's downgraded United States Treasury debt on Aug. 5, Treasury bonds have outperformed almost any other investment available, and the dollar has been one of the strongest currencies in the world. Thanks in part to the relatively strong dollar, the American stock market has fallen less than many others. (Sources: Merrill Lynch (bond indexes), MSCI (stock indexes), Bloomberg (currencies))

HEADLINE: Mornings Are Sober But Better At CBS

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY

 BODY:
There isn't much news you can use on ''The Early Show'' on CBS. It no longer offers dieting tips, barbecue recipes or audience makeovers. There are no pop concerts or ''Growing Pains'' cast reunions. ''The Early Show'' doesn't plan weddings or even forecast rain -- weather is delegated to local affiliates.
CBS's morning show is at times so soberly focused on hard news that it looks almost like PBS or C-Span. Or worse: its stolid co-anchors, Chris Wragge and Erica Hill, stare into the camera with a bleak blue backdrop behind them that gives the show the look of a Soviet newscast in the Brezhnev era. 
The pared-down look and no-nonsense sensibility are signs of how far ''The Early Show'' trails ''Today'' on NBC and ''Good Morning America'' on ABC. It's also a sign of how weakness can become a strength. ''The Early Show'' is a morning program for viewers who aren't morning people.
Rivals serve the news the way some mothers disguise the spinach. Kim Kardashian was a special guest host on ''Today'' on Friday; a top story was the latest in the case of a wife missing in Aruba. ''Good Morning America'' focused on whether Amanda Knox hopes to reunite with her Italian ex-boyfriend.
''The Early Show'' started on Friday with the latest jobs report and the economy, and noted the 10th anniversary of the war in Afghanistan by interviewing two veterans who left teaching jobs to join the military. There was a report on the latest doubts about prostate screening, and a feature about the links between long-term unemployment and depression, stress and divorce.
Even lighter stories have a higher purpose. Ms. Hill on Friday interviewed Lily, a new Sesame Street muppet, but their conversation was pegged to a PBS special on Sunday that uses Lily to highlight the rise in child hunger in the United States.
The ratings gap between the NBC and ABC morning shows narrows at times, and it has grown skinnier since Ann Curry took over top-rated ''Today'' from Meredith Vieira in the summer. But the ''Early'' show hasn't budged from a distant third. The CBS program has fallen slightly further behind since the new ''Early'' team, which includes Jeff Glor at the news desk, took over from the veteran anchor Harry Smith in January. (Mr. Smith later went to NBC, which welcomed him with the showy deference accorded a high-level cold war defector.)
But that doesn't mean that the CBS program hasn't improved by going straight. ''The Early Show'' is following the lead of ''CBS Evening News,'' where Scott Pelley replaced Katie Couric in June and is shaping it in his own earnest image.
Andrew Tyndall, a TV analyst who monitors the content of network newscasts, found that between June and September the CBS evening newscast devoted twice as much airtime to the war in Afghanistan as its rivals did, spent far more time on the economy and reported fewer stories about the media or sex. CBS didn't spend a single minute on animals, whereas ABC devoted 46 minutes to them and NBC 23.
There is freedom in being last. This summer ''The Early Show'' hosted two town hall meetings about the economy, and each one took up the entire first hour. In May, President Obama took questions on the show from a live audience in the Newseum in Washington as well as from viewers who spoke up via YouTube, a co-sponsor of the event. In June, Republicans like Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma and Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin had their turn.
The higher-rated morning shows don't have that kind of attention span. By 7:45 on Thursday, the morning after Steve Jobs died, ''Good Morning America'' was well into an interview with the sobbing parents of a missing baby.
''The Early Show'' on CBS kept on reporting on the passing of Mr. Jobs, a co-founder of Apple. Thursday's edition basically stayed on the topic of Mr. Jobs for most of the morning, bringing in little-known technology writers to discuss Apple and the outsized legacy of the father of the iPod.
Lara Spencer of ''Good Morning America'' had a different approach. ''I was thinking about Steve Jobs and it is a day to remember him, but right now lets talk about 'Twilight,' '' she brightly told her fellow anchors. Turning to ''all you Twihards out there,'' Ms. Spencer announced that Kristen Stewart had confirmed that she was dating her co-star Robert Pattinson in real life.
That's not to say that ''The Early Show'' is entirely frills-free. On Friday the second hour of the program included a profile and interview with Aretha Franklin, who took a reporter along as she went shoe shopping and rehearsed a duet with Tony Bennett.
Mr. Wragge, perhaps already in a weekend mood, permitted himself a joke at the anchor desk. He nodded to the street scene behind him, which actually isn't visible to viewers through the blue scrim that blocks the window. ''I don't know if you notice behind us on Fifth Avenue, but traffic's moving way too slow, drop the pedal and go,'' he said borrowing lyrics from ''Freeway of Love.'' He sobered up in time to announce the next item: Afghan orphans using art to heal their wounds.
It's not ''Today,'' and that's the point. ''The Early Show'' is one place in the world where viewers never have to wonder where in the world is Matt Lauer.

HEADLINE: Ten Years In, Afghan Myths Live On

BYLINE: By BENJAMIN D. HOPKINS and MAGNUS MARSDEN. 
Benjamin D. Hopkins, a historian at George Washington University, and Magnus Marsden, an anthropologist at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, are the authors of ''Fragments of the Afghan Frontier.''

 BODY:
TEN years after invading Afghanistan, on Oct. 7, 2001, the obvious question is whether or not the United States has won the war. Osama bin Laden's death suggests the defeat of Al Qaeda. But even after the planned withdrawal of 30,000 American troops by late 2012, nearly 70,000 will remain on the ground.
Despite all the talk about counterterrorism, the war has never been so narrowly conceived or fought. The United States and its allies have consistently pursued a mission of state-building. The current American strategy of handing over ''ownership'' of the war rests on obtaining local ''buy in'' -- both to the counterinsurgency as well as the larger state-building project -- by winning Afghan ''hearts and minds.'' 
But this approach has been tried, and failed, in the past. Indeed, the British Empire followed the same flawed strategy more than a century ago.
Nearly all elements of the current counterinsurgency strategy in Afghanistan, from ''clear and hold'' tactics to arming ''tribal militias,'' have their origins in the activities of British colonial administrators. The most important of these was Sir Robert Groves Sandeman, who in 1891 insisted that to control the people of the Afghan frontier, the British had to appeal to their ''hearts and minds'' (and pockets).
By ''knowing the tribes,'' Sir Robert believed he could rule them through their ''traditions'' -- something both more legitimate in the eyes of the tribesmen and cheaper for the colonial state. However, many of the ''traditions'' he employed were at least partly colonial creations.
Sir Robert recruited locals into state-sponsored militias to police themselves. But rather than bolstering state authority, Sir Robert planted the seeds of discord. Arming local factions proved a poor instrument for establishing central control. The people of the frontier came to inhabit a nebulous no-man's land where the state exercised little control over them. Today, this area is known as Pakistan's Tribal Areas.
The United States and its allies have largely mimicked the policies of British India's frontier administrators. They have made extensive use of what they understand to be ''native traditions'' to bolster their authority. American soldiers sit in tribal jirgas, or assemblies, to win the support of local elders; tribal militias called arbakai are recruited to police the populace. But rather than showing the sophistication of the military's cultural knowledge, these efforts merely demonstrate to Afghans the coalition's poor understanding of local cultures.
The arbakai, an institution foreign to northern Afghanistan, may in fact lead people there to consider the Taliban favorably. As one local from Kunduz told us, ''Before, there were people who were with the government by day and Taliban by night. Now there are people who are arbakai in the day and thieves at night.'' Even authority figures in regions where the arbakai is indigenous, like Paktia Province, told us that it ''won't work now: 30 years of war means that everybody acts independently, not according to tradition.''
Afghanistan is not a country of primitive tribes cut off from the modern world. The singular focus on tribes, the Taliban, and ethnicity as the keys to understanding and resolving the conflict misses the nuances of the region's past and present. Rather than fanatical tribesmen or poor victims in need of aid, many of these people are active and capable participants in a globalized economy.
The international focus on ''corruption'' tends to paint Afghan merchants as venal and incapable. Afghan entrepreneurs are dismissed as immoral profiteers, cronies of warlords or international drug smugglers. Such views are dangerous: these are the people who will fill the void left when international subsidies to the Afghan government end.
In fact, Afghan merchants play important economic roles at home and abroad. They export used Japanese cars from Dubai to Central Asia and precious stones to Hong Kong and Sri Lanka. They sell medicinal plants to India and Germany and regularly cross the region seeking new economic opportunities, connecting Afghans with the world beyond. In spite of Afghanistan's poverty, these traders are central to the economy and critically important to the stability of the Afghan state.
Like the fixation on tribal tradition, the West's obsession with corruption obscures the intricate social and economic networks that define modern Afghanistan. As the British experience of the late 19th century shows, a simplistic and unceasing focus on ''tradition'' as an exit strategy will not establish a stable Afghan state.
If America and its allies hope to identify and partner with Afghans who are willing and able to build a stable political and economic future, they must set aside the stale caricatures about ''tradition'' that have long dominated thinking about the region.
Unless they do, 10 years of fighting, an investment of over $400 billion by American taxpayers, and the deaths of more than 2,700 allied military personnel, not to mention an unknown number of Afghans, will have been for naught.

HEADLINE: Real Actors In a Real Wedding With a Full Cast

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON

 BODY:
Jessie Austrian and Noah Brody know how to play a married couple. They do it eight times a week.
They are actors. They are getting married again. This time for real.
And yes, the entire cast of their current play will have - how else to put this? - parts in the ceremony on Sunday.
A co-director, Ben Steinfeld - who is also an artistic director, with the bride and groom, of the Fiasco Theater, a Manhattan-based troupe - will officiate. The other actors will be in the wedding party. 
Then, on Tuesday, they will go back to work in the Fiasco production of Shakespeare's ''Cymbeline'' at the Barrow Street Theater. Ben Brantley, who reviewed it in The New York Times in January when it was playing next door to the fiasco that was Julie Taymor's ''Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark,'' said Fiasco ''was addressing and breezily overcoming many of the same problems that appear to be plaguing Ms. Taymor and company.''
Mr. Brody had proposed in 2008. ''We'd been unemployed for so long we figured we'd be unemployed when we planned our wedding a year in advance,'' she said. ''And at the time, we knew a lot of people who were getting married and were happy to be engaged, but it seemed like the next moment they were stressed out planning the wedding. We wanted to stretch out the time we were engaged. We put a moratorium and said we weren't going to talk about planning a wedding for one year.''
In fact, it took them two years to get around to actually doing the planning. That was before the two-week run at the New Victory Theater on West 42nd Street. Or before the Barrow Street Theater proposed an Off Broadway run starting in September.
''We told them Oct. 9 and something had to happen with a band and a caterer and a photographer'' that had already been hired, Ms. Austrian said. ''We were incredibly grateful that they were easygoing and generous and said they would give us the weekend off.''
The production's press agent, Bruce Cohen, did some back-of-the-envelope calculations and said that canceling four performances - two on Saturday and two on Sunday - amounted to a $56,000 wedding present. But there are two footnotes to that.
''We are making up all four of those shows,'' Ms. Austrian said. ''We made up one on Monday.''
And, as Mr. Brody put it, ''It's not $56,000 that we get to spend. That's really going to help knock down that grad school debt.''
They accumulated it at Brown University. Ms. Austrian said they had been ''flirting in a more innocent way'' during Shakespeare's ''Winter's Tale'' before she and Mr. Steinfeld played a married couple in Harold Pinter's play ''Old Times,'' with Mr. Brody directing.
''It's twisted and dark and very funny,'' Mr. Brody said. ''Part of the power dynamic between the people is who gets to decide what really happened at any given time, and the answer is, the last person who spoke.''
The next person who spoke was Ms. Austrian. ''That's just what we happened to be working on when we got to know each other,'' she said.
-She did not have the last word here. Mr. Brody piped up: ''At the same time I was also playing the lead in a play in which I was a psychotic murderer.''
An unmarried psychotic murderer.
For their ceremony, there will be touches from other moments in the couple's careers besides ''Cymbeline.'' Ms. Austrian's dress, for example, is being made by the Tony Award winner Martin Pakledinaz, whom she met when she made her Broadway debut in ''Lend Me a Tenor.''
On Monday, for their one-day honeymoon, Mr. Brody said that they would go to ''a nice hotel and spa place where we'll just get to spend 24 hours basking in each other's eyes and getting massages and generally treating ourselves as if we actually have money.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: So Far, It's Been a Half-Empty Year for Financial Forecasters

BYLINE: By PAUL SULLIVAN

 BODY:
IN January, I set out to write quarterly columns that would check in with the same group of market prognosticators. I wanted to see how accurate their forecasts would be and what they would say when they were wrong.
But I'll give them this: in terms of macroeconomic events, this has not been an easy year to predict, starting with the earthquake in Japan and the revolutions in the Middle East. There has also been the continuing failure of European politicians to come up with a workable solution to Greece's debt problem and, in August, Standard & Poor's downgrade of the United States credit rating.
Perhaps not surprisingly, the group this time around was unwilling to venture a guess on that staple of all market predictions: where the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index will end the year. The best I could muster from anyone was ''higher'' than it is now.
The group has been consistently off the mark on economic growth, lowering their expectations each quarter. Predictions of 3 to 4 percent growth in January have given way to predictions this time of half that, or less. 
So given the year so far, it is remarkable that many of this group's predictions have held true, for good and bad. Here is an assessment of the group's calls to date and some tepid predictions on what the last quarter will bring.
GOOD CALLS The good calls have been the conservative ones.
Bill Stone, the chief investment strategist at PNC Wealth Management, has championed dividend-paying stocks all year and continues to do so. What has changed is his reason for recommending them.
At the beginning of the year, Mr. Stone said he backed these stocks because he believed that money would move from bonds into stocks and that dividend-paying ones would benefit first. As other people turned against stocks over the summer, he said that companies paying a dividend had the cash reserves to continue to pay or increase them -- evidence that they were well run.
Now, like other strategists, Mr. Stone sees dividend-paying stocks as unique survivors and one of the few securities that offer income. The average dividend yield on the S.&.P 500, 2.22 percent, is now higher than the 2.08 percent yield on 10-year Treasuries for the first time since the 1950s.
''We're sticking with the call, but when it won't work is when we get a strong snapback,'' Mr. Stone said. ''When the market decides it's not so concerned about the double-dip recession, it will drive the other stocks higher more quickly.''
The other stock picker who has stuck to his recommendations with good results is Niall J. Gannon, director of wealth management at the Gannon Group at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney. His big call at the beginning of the year was on stocks of companies that derived a substantial proportion of their revenue from outside the United States. One of his favorites is Nike, which is up 3.78 percent this year.
He said these were the only companies that were insulated from country-specific economic shocks. People may be buying fewer bottles of Coca-Cola in Greece, but they may be buying more in Brazil.
Of course, being right is not always something to gloat about. Richard Madigan, chief investment officer for J. P. Morgan's Global Access Portfolios, has been right about something he wishes he had gotten wrong: unemployment in the United States. He predicted it would stay between 9 and 10 percent all year. While he was briefly wrong when the unemployment rate dipped to 8.9 percent in March, he is right again, and he does not like the implications of being correct.
''For markets, it's going to be a much more aggressive campaign cycle into next year,'' he said. ''The political rhetoric will distract markets. It'll be noise with a lot of policy uncertainty.''
With this bleak outlook, he is encouraging clients to stop thinking in calendar years. Trying to make up for the losses of the last two months could land people in worse straits.
CHANGED CALLS If there was one area that did not turn out as this group imagined, it was debt.
Richard Cookson, chief investment officer at Citi Private Bank, was the most brutally honest member of the group. A week before our call, he issued a report to the firm's clients conceding that he had gotten one of his calls on long-duration bonds wrong. He titled it ''Gross Miscalculation.''
Now, instead of those government bonds, he is recommending investors shift to long-dated corporate bonds.
''Corporate balance sheets are very strong right now,'' Mr. Cookson said. ''The reason long-dated investment grade has done so well is because of a fall in government bond yields. They've risen to the sort of level where they're more attractive than long-dated government bonds.''
He said he still believed that inflation was not a threat, which meant that yields on government bonds would stay low for the foreseeable future.
Mr. Madigan and Marc D. Stern, chief investment officer at Bessemer Trust, both predicted in January that yields on Treasury bonds would rise this year, as people invested in other assets. But the opposite has happened.
''We've gotten the bond market wrong,'' Mr. Stern said. ''The five-year Treasury was at 2 percent at the beginning of the year. We thought it would go to 4 percent and you'd lock in your losses. It went to 1 percent, and it could go to 0.5 percent.''
Yet he warned that when the economy improves, bond yields will rise quickly. ''You're playing with fire,'' he said.
This is another call where it would have been better if Mr. Stern had been right. The persistently low yields on Treasuries are not a reflection of investors' love of American assets but of their fear of everything else.
Municipal bonds have been a bright spot if only because there have not been the big defaults that the market analyst Meredith Whitney predicted at the beginning of the year. Mr. Gannon was particularly pleased by this. He recommended a 40 percent allocation to municipal bonds in the portfolios of his wealthiest clients. That allocation has returned 9 percent so far this year. While he attributes this to a bond bubble, he said he was happy that his clients could benefit from it.
FINAL QUARTER The most troubling development may be that markets will remain volatile. While the group was hesitant to say how the year would end, they shared a common frustration -- that policy makers in the United States and Europe were hurting their economies.
Politicians in the United States, they all said, are stuck in ideological positions over spending, debt and taxes and not focused on finding a way to stimulate the economy and create jobs. ''The very difficult debate surrounding the debt ceiling was destructive of confidence,'' Mr. Stern said. ''When you already have weak confidence, that's bound to worsen it. And it did.''
Their European counterparts are just as bad, delaying a decision on what to do with Greece -- and by extension, other shaky countries in the European Union. ''Greece will default in the next few weeks,'' Mr. Cookson said. ''It's going to mean something of a banking crisis. How do you ring-fence Greece and not Ireland and Portugal?''
Mr. Madigan said this summer that European politicians would continue to ''kick the can down the road.'' That is what they have done. The result has been what he termed ''staggering volatility.''
''If you were to look at long-term U.S. Treasury price volatility, it's running along with equity volatility along with gold and Swiss franc volatility,'' he said. ''It's difficult to focus on fundamentals when volatility and correlation are dictating the range.''
Or as Mr. Gannon put it: ''You have to recognize that volatility is here to stay. Prices are being set by minute-by-minute trading, so we cannot look to daily market moves to validate our opinions or thesis as an investor.''
The only certainty, then, is that the fourth quarter will be interesting.

HEADLINE: In Search of ...: A new transport chief and Port Authority director for New York

 BODY:
Two very good officials are leaving two of the most important jobs in New York State -- one by choice, the other because Gov. Andrew Cuomo has asked him to go. Mr. Cuomo needs to quickly find exemplary replacements to run the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. And he will have to support them when they make politically tough but necessary decisions. 
Jay Walder, the chairman of the M.T.A., has decided to take a cushier and much higher paying job in Hong Kong running a global transportation firm. People who know him say Mr. Walder was frustrated because Governor Cuomo was inaccessible and often appeared oblivious to the problems facing the New York City transit system.
Christopher Ward, the executive director of the Port Authority who deserves credit for kick-starting construction at the former World Trade Center site, was told last month that Mr. Cuomo was ready for him to leave.
Leaders always prefer choosing their own team, but it will be hard for the governor to find comparably high-caliber professionals who can -- or will -- do these very demanding jobs during very tough economic times.
The Port Authority, run jointly by New York and New Jersey, controls the area's ports, tunnels, main bridges and airports, as well as ground zero. In August, Mr. Ward announced steep bridge and toll increases, drawing complaints from both Mr. Cuomo and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey. The money is needed to keep the authority's transportation and real estate network going. His replacement will have to find areas for savings and additional sources of revenue -- and will need both governors to back him or her up.
Mr. Walder has imposed better management structures on the huge and unwieldy M.T.A. It runs 6,000 buses, 8,566 commuter trains and the 100-year-old city subway system, which together carry 8.5 million riders a day. His replacement will have to keep a $12.6 billion budget balanced while negotiating new union contracts for 57,000 employees. The new M.T.A. boss will have to head off legislators determined to end a payroll tax that brings $1.5 billion a year to the transit system and keep funds coming from Washington, Albany and City Hall.
Both of these jobs are often thankless and essential to the commerce and economic health of the whole state. Governor Cuomo needs to choose dynamic, independent managers and then give them his support and blessings.

HEADLINE: Inventories Increased In August

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Wholesale businesses increased their stockpiles of autos, computer equipment and heavy machinery in August, raising inventories for a 20th consecutive month as their sales rose at the fastest pace in five months. 
Another report showed that consumers cut back their borrowing in August by the most in 16 months. The drop suggested that many worried about taking on new debt while the economy slumped and the stock market fluctuated wildly.
The combination of rising sales and inventories should be a good sign for future factory output.
The Commerce Department said Friday that wholesale inventories rose 0.4 percent in August after a 0.8 percent July gain. Sales were up 1 percent, the best showing since a 3 percent rise in March.
The stronger sales gain was an encouraging sign after a slowdown that had raised concerns about whether the economy could be in danger of toppling into a recession. Economists expect overall economic growth to post a modest rebound in the second half of this year.
The August inventory gain pushed stockpiles to a seasonally adjusted level of $464.3 billion, up 21 percent from a September 2009 low of $383.6 billion. Companies were slashing inventories during the recession as they tried to control costs in the face of falling demand. The change to rebuilding inventories has been a major factor supporting growth over the last two years.
The economy slowed significantly in the first six months of this year as consumers, feeling the pinch of soaring gas prices, cut back on spending on other items. The overall economy grew at an anemic rate of just 0.9 percent from January through March, the weakest performance since the recession ended in June 2009.
Economists expect growth will show a slight improvement to about 2 percent in the last half of this year, still too weak to make a significant improvement in the unemployment rate.
The government reported Friday that the unemployment rate in September remained stuck at 9.1 percent for a third consecutive month.
Meanwhile, fewer Americans used their credit cards and a measure of auto and student loan demand fell.
Total borrowing dropped by $9.5 billion in August, the Federal Reserve said Friday. That follows an increase of $11.9 billion in July.
Consumer borrowing had risen for 10 consecutive months before the August decline, which was the largest drop since April 2010
Borrowing for auto and student loans plunged $7.2 billion in August. A category that includes credit cards tumbled $2.3 billion.
The overall decline lowered total borrowing to a seasonally adjusted $2.44 trillion. Borrowing is just 2.1 percent higher than the recent low hit in September 2010.
Americans have been struggling with high unemployment, meager pay raises and a big increase in gasoline prices in the spring. That has depressed consumer spending, which fuels 70 percent of economic growth.
Economists expect modest growth of 2 percent in the second half of the year. Households began borrowing less and saving more when the country fell into recession and unemployment surged.
While economists say they think that borrowing will gradually increase in coming months, they do not expect consumers to load up on debt the way they did during the housing boom. Americans felt wealthier then and were more willing to take on added debt because of the soaring value of their homes.
The Federal Reserve's borrowing report covers auto loans, student loans and credit cards.

HEADLINE: Snapshots of Layoffs' Effect, From the Newly Unemployed

BYLINE: By FERNANDA SANTOS and CHELSIA ROSE MARCIUS

 BODY:
The last school bell on Friday was the beginning of unemployment for 672 employees in roughly 350 city schools -- school aides, parent coordinators, health aides and other support staff members. These are four of the school workers who were let go.
CLIFTONIA JOHNSONCommunity associate, $37,000 a year 
When students at Marta Valle High School on the Lower East Side met Ms. Johnson, 48, they saw a face they could relate to, she said. She understood that students sometimes felt disconnected from instructors who did not share their skin color.
''These types of children, they don't have it easy, and they need people in their school building that look like them and identify with them from a positive standpoint,'' said Ms. Johnson, who is black. ''I was a pillar, as the parents like to call me.''
After more than 20 years of service, she said, ''I have a pretty deep knowledge of the community and how important it is that schools here are reflective of the people who live in this community. They're slowly taking that away.''
NANETTE SEPULVEDAFamily assistant, $25,000 a year
As one of two family assistants serving the 190 families at a shelter in District 19 in Brooklyn, Ms. Sepulveda acted as a liaison with schools, ushering students onto the bus each morning, supervising those who needed medication and ensuring that all received a school lunch. As the only assistant who speaks Spanish, she was often called upon to interpret. Ms. Sepulveda, 49, said that after the layoffs, she would be unable to pay for utilities or buy college textbooks for her children. She is willing to take a job at a fast-food restaurant, but after 16 years in city schools, ''that's not where I want to be,'' she said. ''I want to ask: 'Why are you giving my job to outside contractors? Because you can pay them a low wage?' They're already paying me a low wage. If the aim is to collapse the system, they're doing it.''
MARILEYSI GARCIAParent coordinator, $46,000 a year
The first people Ms. Garcia called after she was laid off were some of the families at Bronx Leadership Academy High School.
''They identify with me because I'm Hispanic myself and come from a low-income background,'' she said. ''They knew that I was not just there to collect a check, but to really help them answer their questions.''
Ms. Garcia, 32, of Clason Point in the Bronx, said she did not know how she would make ends meet. ''I work and I struggle anyway to make payments on time,'' she said. ''My daughter just started kindergarten in September; she's very smart and picks up on things. I don't want her to get off balance.''
REGINA DUDLEYParent coordinator, $48,545 a year
If it had not been for the help of a parent coordinator at P.S. 233 Langston Hughes in Brooklyn, Regina Dudley might never have discovered that her son Sayquan had Asperger's syndrome. ''If it wasn't for her sitting me down, walking me through and showing me what I was entitled to have, I would have never known,'' she said. Until she was laid off, Ms. Dudley, 38, of Canarsie, Brooklyn, was a parent coordinator herself, at the High School for Global Citizenship in Prospect Heights.
She wonders who will check in with the families she worked with. And she worries about caring for her own son. ''I'm sitting here right now trying to contemplate, how am I going to do this without falling back into public assistance?'' she said. ''But how am I going to survive without it?''

HEADLINE: More Bleak Job Numbers: It is becoming increasingly impossible to undo the damage from years of high unemployment

 BODY:
It would take a lot of optimism to put a positive spin on the jobs report for September, released on Friday by the Labor Department.
Employers added 103,000 jobs last month, allaying fears, for now, of a double-dip recession. But even if the economy avoids another contraction, the numbers confirm that the job market is in a deep rut that is, for all purposes, indistinguishable from recession. There are still 14 million people officially unemployed, and nearly 12 million more who have given up actively looking for work or who are working part time but need full-time jobs.
Earlier this week, President Obama and the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben Bernanke, delivered bleak economic assessments, which demand a government response. The economy, already at a crawl, could well slow down further in response to economic setbacks in Europe and China or to homegrown problems like political gridlock that delay spending on job-creation efforts. 
The economy is not producing enough jobs, and many of the ones created are lousy. Much of last month's job growth came as 45,000 striking Verizon employees returned to work. Without that one-time boost, the economy added only 58,000 new positions in September, roughly in line with the slow pace of job creation over the past several months.
That is not nearly enough to lower the unemployment rate, which is at 9.1 percent and is almost certain to rise in the months ahead, barring an unexpected upsurge in economic activity.
The new jobs are generally in lower-paying fields, like home health care, and in part-time and temporary employment. These kinds of employment may be better than no work, but they are generally not the types of jobs that allow workers to get ahead.
The September report also shows the permanent scars caused by persistent joblessness. The share of workers who have been unemployed for more than six months increased from 42.9 percent to 44.6 percent, near its record high from early last year. That is likely to translate into irreversible reductions in the standard of living for millions of Americans because the longer one is unemployed, the harder it becomes to find new work, especially at previous pay levels.
Children will be among those most harmed by the jobs crisis. The Economic Policy Institute, using data from the September report, has calculated that 278,000 teachers and other public school employees have lost their jobs since September 2008. Over the same period, 48,000 new teaching jobs were needed to keep up with the increased enrollments but were never created. In all, public schools are now short 326,000 jobs.
At a time when more and better education is seen as crucial to economic dynamism and competitiveness, larger class sizes and fewer teachers are the last thing the nation needs. Staffing reductions also mean that schools are less able to respond to the needs of poor children, whose ranks have increased by 2.3 million from 2008 to 2010.
The situation calls out for swift passage of Mr. Obama's jobs bill and even more far-reaching efforts to revive growth and employment. The alternative is lasting damage from a jobs crisis that has already done enormous harm to families and communities.
Correction: October 15, 2011, Saturday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An editorial on Oct. 8 about jobs incorrectly cited an analysis by the Economic Policy Institute. The report said 278,000 teachers and other public school employees had lost their jobs since September 2008 -- not December 2007.

Here's a way to save money: Move in with relatives.
Lots of Americans have done just that during the economic downturn, an analysis of census data from the Pew Research Center finds. 
In fact, the trend helped touch off the largest increase in the number of Americans living in multigenerational households in modern history, the report says. From 2007 to 2009, the total spiked to 51.4 million, from 46.5 million. Such households might include a couple and their parents or in-laws, adult children, younger children and grandchildren.
The unemployed, whose numbers are growing, are much more likely to live in multigenerational households - 25.4 percent did in 2009, compared with 15.7 percent of those with jobs.
Living in mixed-generation households appears to be keeping many out of poverty. Although their adjusted incomes over all are lower, Pew found, the poverty rate among people in multigenerational households is substantially smaller than the rate for those in other households - 11.5 percent in the mixed-generation households in 2009 versus 14.6 percent in other types of households.
Plus, the potential benefits of such living arrangements are the greatest for groups that have been most affected by the recession. Among the unemployed, the poverty rate in 2009 was 17.5 percent for those living in multigenerational households, compared with 30.3 percent for those living in other households.
Members of other economically vulnerable groups - young adults, Hispanics and blacks - who live in multigenerational households also experience sharply lower poverty rates than those in other households.
Have you ever lived with relatives? Did it help you save money?

HEADLINE: How Do You Move a 340-Ton Artwork? Very Carefully

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

 BODY:
RIVERSIDE, Calif. -- It is just under 60 miles from the Stone Valley Quarry here -- an expanse of dust, boulders, roaring bulldozers and cut granite hillsides -- to the lush campus of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art on Museum Mile. Behind a pile of rocks the other afternoon, out of sight from the road, workers scurried around a 340-ton, 21-foot-high solid granite boulder, trussed with red steel girders, gleaming under the desert sun. If all goes well, this boulder will be hovering over a cut in the earth on the grounds of the museum, and be open for viewing, by the end of November.
The piece, known as ''Levitated Mass,'' by Michael Heizer, a California-born sculptor known for huge outdoor installations that make extensive use of earth and rock, is by any measure an ambitious and brash use of outdoor space. But more ambitious might be the logistics of moving Mr. Heizer's rock, which was dynamited out of a hillside, from here to there. It is a trip that will take the boulder through the heart of one of the most congested urban centers in the country: nine nights at six miles an hour, through 120 miles of roads, highways, bridges, overpasses, overhead wires, alarmingly low-hanging traffic lights and sharp turns. 
The effort, nearly five years in the planning (though Mr. Heizer has been making sketches of it as far back as the late 1960s), feels nothing short of a military movement: an incursion through a bewildering thicket of state, city and county regulations and a region with a notoriously difficult street grid. Even the matter of where to pull over each day is a challenge; this is not a Motel 6 kind of trip.
''You can't cowboy this through,'' said Rick Albrecht, the project manager for the move, leaning against a ladder, his sunglasses and hard hat covered in dust. ''You have to be meticulous about this.''
Michael Govan, executive director of the museum, offered a hint of the bureaucratic obstacles involved, and never mind the technical ones.
''A million permits,'' he said. ''And the State of California is always reviewing the state of its bridges and roads. So a route plan that would have worked a couple of days ago doesn't work today.'' He compared the project to erecting the Great Pyramids of Egypt. ''The Egyptians didn't have rubber tires or diesel engines,'' he said. ''But they also didn't have weak streets.''
Yet Mr. Govan raised his hand when asked, in an interview in his office last week, if the oft-delayed move would be put off again. ''This is going,'' he said. ''It's going. It has to come before the rainy season,'' which begins in November. (Two days later the move was put off another week; it is now scheduled to begin the week of Oct. 17.) Mr. Albrecht's company, Emmert International, makes a business of moving very large objects, like the Hubbell Telescope and a building here and there. But this is the first time he has been asked to oversee the relocation of a giant rock. ''That's what the artist wants,'' he said. ''So that's what the artist is going to get.''
How do you do it? The rock has already been raised off the ground by hydraulic lifts and put in a cradle; steel trusses were built around the cradle, all part of a modular tractor with 22 axles, each with its own set of brakes, and 196 wheels. It will weigh 1,210,900 pounds, including the rock. ''That's a lot,'' Mr. Albrecht said. ''But the weight per axle should be about 349,950 pounds. That's not so bad. You'll get more on some of these rock trips coming out of this quarry every day. We're not worried.''
The rig will be about 295 feet long and 27 feet wide and require a crew of 12 people to operate it. The modular assembly means it should be able to turn, like a caterpillar, and thus navigate corners in Los Angeles that can challenge more conventional rigs. Door to door the distance is 60 miles, though the actual drive is going to be closer to 120 miles, as engineers plot a route that can accommodate the huge size of what is known as the Prime Mover, and one that steers clear of low bridges and wires. Any route must have stopover spots to park the rock as it waits for night. ''The last thing we are trying to figure out is where they are going to park it in South Central the night before,'' said John Bowsher, the director of special installations at the museum, referring to the Los Angeles neighborhood.
Teams of workers will be deployed to lift telephone and power lines, swing traffic lights to the side and lay down steel plates on suspect patches of roads or bridges. Once the rock arrives at the two-and-a-half-acre lot at the museum that will become its home, another process will begin: disassembling the transporter and sliding the boulder so it is centered over a 456-foot-long slot that has already been slashed into the ground and covered with concrete. The rock will be moved with a gantry system of pulleys, and positioned at the direction of the artist, Mr. Bowsher said, to make certain the final angle is exactly right. That will take another two weeks.
The rock is to rest on two lips that extend partly over the slot from each side of the cut, to help create the illusion that it is hovering in space. Viewers will be able to walk under the rock and peer up 15 feet at its underside.
Mr. Govan said the sculpture fit into his vision of trying to expand the museum beyond its walls and described it as both ''super ancient and super modern.''
''It fits into a grand tradition of using public space,'' he said.
He said Mr. Heizer had long been drawn to the Stone Valley Quarry because of the nature of its granite. ''Black-and-white speckled with a little bit of rust in it,'' Mr. Govan said. ''He saw the rock and asked the quarry not to touch it.''
Steve Dumont, a heavy-equipment operator at the site, said rocks like that normally don't last long at the quarry. ''We usually blow them up because we don't want them this big,'' he said. ''This has been here a long time.''
The whole project will cost close to $10 million, and Mr. Govan said he has drawn criticism about the wisdom of such a project at a time when California is reeling from cuts to everything from colleges to parks.
''I get these letters and telephone calls: 'I can't believe you. The economy is so bad, and you're moving a rock?' '' he said. ''People have this image that we are buying it and spending money on a rock. But we are putting more people to work here in L.A. than Obama. I mean, all the money is going to have an economic impact in California.''
Mr. Govan left little doubt when asked if this work was to be a permanent exhibition at the museum. ''Try to move it,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Shares Fall After Europe Debt Downgrades

BYLINE: By JOSHUA BRUSTEIN

 BODY:
After trading in a narrow range for most of the day, the major Wall Street indexes closed slightly lower on Friday as investors weighed modestly positive news about the American labor market against more evidence of troubles in Europe.
The Labor Department reported that the United States economy added more jobs than expected last month, easing investors' fears that the country was slipping into recession. But Fitch Ratings downgraded the government debt of Spain and Italy, sending the stock market and the euro marginally lower in afternoon trading.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed down 9.51 points, or 0.8 percent, at 1,155.46, while the Dow Jones industrial average fell 20.21 points, or 0.2 percent, to 11,103.12. The Nasdaq composite index lost 27.47 points, or 1.1 percent, to close at 2,479.35. Yields on the benchmark 10-year United States Treasury note rose to 2.08 percent from 1.99 percent late Thursday. The price fell 24/32, to 101 14/32. 
The S.& P. index finished the week up 2.1 percent, buoyed by an astonishing late-day rally on Tuesday as well as strong sessions on Wednesday and Thursday. It recovered from steep losses earlier in the week, when it briefly traded in bear market territory, defined as a 20 percent drop from its previous peak. The Dow Jones index gained 1.7 percent for the week, while the Nasdaq rose 2.6 percent.
Third-quarter earnings will be a major factor in whether markets hold onto their gains, said Rebecca Patterson, chief markets strategist at J. P. Morgan Asset Management. Companies will begin to report next week, and analysts' forecasts vary widely. That is a reflection of the uncertainty in the global economy, she said.
''The earnings season is kind of a wild card,'' Ms. Patterson said.
The Labor Department said that American employers added 103,000 jobs in September, while the unemployment rate remained at 9.1 percent. Some investors pointed to gains in average hourly earnings and an increase in the hiring of temporary workers as signs in the report of an improving outlook in the labor market.
Still, economists cautioned that the numbers were weak and said the report seemed positive only in light of low expectations.
The jobs report shows an economy that is ''neither reaccelerating nor shifting into recession,'' wrote Steve Blitz, senior economist for ITG Investment Research, in a report to investors. He said the American economy remained vulnerable because of its reliance on exports.
''The employment data in the coming months should be more of the same, which isn't much, and if growth starts to decelerate more rapidly around the world, negative jobs numbers are more likely than not,'' he wrote.
The jobs report, coupled with somewhat optimistic reports on retail sales and auto sales for September, quelled fears of an immediate recession, said David Kelly, chief market strategist for JPMorgan Funds, but traders were probably cashing in on gains from earlier in the week.
''With this dollop of good news, it's natural for people to take money off the table,'' he said. ''But when you're investing, rather than trading, you do need to look at the fundamentals. The fundamentals do justify both higher interest rates and higher stock prices than prevail today.''
Fitch downgraded its rating on Italian debt one level after similar moves by the other major rating agencies in recent weeks. It cut its rating on Spain two levels. In both cases, the agency cited concerns about debt coupled with low growth. The outlook on both countries was negative.
The move weighed on Wall Street, particularly banks, whose exposure to the debt crisis in Europe is unclear. Shares for Bank of America dropped 6.1 percent, JPMorgan Chase shares slipped 5.2 percent and Citigroup shares dropped 5.3 percent.
The euro also fell after Fitch's action, to $1.3384, from $1.3449.
Marc Chandler, an analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman, said investors would continue to put more weight on the situation in Europe than on the domestic economy. ''The U.S. is not the cross hairs,'' he said. ''Europe is.''
European markets, which closed before the downgrades, were moderately higher.

HEADLINE: Ships, Steeds and Kings, on Two Legs

BYLINE: By ALASTAIR MACAULAY

 BODY:
MONTCLAIR, N.J. -- How can this demonstrate that? How can art demonstrate life or history or another work of art? With the speech ''O for a muse of fire,'' Shakespeare starts his play ''Henry V'' with words about the challenge for theater of trying to represent war. (''Think, when we talk of horses, that you see them.'') When Laurence Olivier made his 1944 film of ''Henry V'' he quickly bypassed the issue of theater, showing his audience real horses, real arrows, real armor, real grass; and he commissioned music by William Walton to help make the movie exciting and affecting.
Sixty years later the writer-director-choreographer David Gordon deconstructed and reconstructed the whole thing. Shakespeare's play can take well over three hours in performance; Olivier's film lasts 2 hours 17 minutes. Mr. Gordon's ''Dancing Henry Five'' -- which has been revived this week at Montclair State University's Alexander Kasser Theater here -- lasts just over an hour. Mr. Gordon refers with sound clips to Olivier's movie, to several audio recordings of the play and to another score Walton composed during World War II, ''The Wise Virgins,'' itself an adaptation of Bach. 
The word ''postmodern'' was invented for precedent-conscious constructions like this. Dance and portable items of scenery -- chairs, poles, lengths of fabric -- and recorded sound and live speech become the mixed media used here. Valda Setterfield plays several supporting roles and, principally, a non-Shakespearean Chorus, drawing our attention in Mr. Gordon's words to several further aspects.
And so ''Dancing Henry Five'' -- wryly, entertainingly, touchingly, economically -- reminds us where Shakespeare or his sources changed history; of the recurrent paradox whereby leaders claim God for either side in battle (''I don't know what the losers say,'' Ms. Setterfield adds); of the perplexed feelings of a mother who, though not wishing her soldier son to be endangered, wants him to succeed in battle and therefore to kill some other mother's son; and of the impossibility of seven dancers and Ms. Setterfield delivering either Shakespeare's play or the events it tells. The means are simple, the dancing far from virtuoso; the thought and meanings are complex.
No plain reaction is possible. Just as you're noticing how near-amateurish some incident looks (deliberately) with these reduced forces, you then see some aspect of pageantry or spectacle that effectively sketches big-scale history. Just as you observe how modern these performers look -- the dancers appear dressed for rugby, in shorts and striped shirts -- the movement suggests some aspect of courtly behavior or military maneuver.
Often ''Dancing Henry Five'' evokes not the era of Henry V or Shakespeare but the centuries that followed. Walton's music often suggests the Baroque; some of Mr. Gordon's illustrations of courtly etiquette evoke the 19th century. There are obvious features in which Mr. Gordon's dance vocabulary borrows from ballet, and yet his idiom is largely elaborate pedestrianism. The dancers walk, rhythmically, in changing patterns that suggest travel, military action, a court dance, a state procession.
One dancer stands on a length of fabric and is pulled across the stage by another: this suggests any number of historical images, but as a second and third couple do it, with poles held as masts, you see a navy, and its slow, inexorable and awe-inspiring progress becomes strangely moving. At the Battle of Agincourt you see lines crossing, wheeling, turning. It's an abstraction of a battle, and yet you see cavalry, steeds, scouts and corpses, all in constant motion. When Henry (Robert La Fosse) woos Princess Katherine of France (Karen Graham), it's like a pencil sketch of a 19th-century grand pas de deux, but so expressive that it brings us closer to the ceremonies that such duets were originally about than most ballet does today. (You almost see the robes falling from their arms.)
''Dancing Henry Five'' has plenty to say about war and history and Shakespeare, but it's also just about the nature of the performing arts. At the same time, it's in love with the potential of dance theater and amused by the limitations of its resources. It operates on so many levels and is so conscious of historical revisionism that, on Thursday night, as Walton's wonderfully moving arrangement of Bach's ''Sheep May Safely Graze'' (BWV 208) was played, I remembered another layer. Walton arranged his Bach ''Wise Virgins'' score for a ballet by Frederick Ashton. In her memoirs Margot Fonteyn recalls a wartime billboard that advertised it as ''The Wise Virgins (subject to alteration).''
''Dancing Henry Five'' runs through Sunday at the Alexander Kasser Theater, Montclair State University, 1 Normal Avenue, Montclair, N.J.; (973) 655-5112, peakperfs.org.

HEADLINE: Mortgages At Low Rates

BYLINE: By ANN CARRNS

 BODY:
The average rate for a conventional, 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell below 4 percent for the first time on record, according to Freddie Mac's weekly market survey that came out on Thursday. 
While that is good news for anyone who wants to buy a house or refinance an existing mortgage, Freddie Mac's chief economist, Frank Nothaft, noted in a prepared statement that the decline reflected worries about the global economy.
The 15-year fixed rate also fell to ''the lowest level on record'' for the sixth consecutive week, the survey found.
Mortgage rates have tracked a slide in 10-year Treasury yields, amid concern that Europe's debt crisis is worsening and the United States economy may slide back into a recession.
Freddie Mac reported that 30-year fixed-rate home loans averaged 3.94 percent, with an average of 0.8 points, for the week ending Oct. 6. That's down from last week's average of 4.01 percent. Last year at this time, the average was 4.27 percent. (Points are essentially interest paid up front, in a lump sum.)
Meanwhile, the average 15-year fixed-rate mortgage was 3.26 percent, with an average of 0.8 points. Last week, it was 3.28 percent, and a year ago, it averaged 3.72 percent.
An exception to the drop in home loan rates was for one-year adjustable rate mortgages, or ARMS. Those rates inched up, to 2.95 percent with an average of .05 points, as the Fed began replacing $400 billion of its short-term Treasury securities, which serve as benchmarks for many ARMs, Mr. Nothaft said.
The question now is whether many Americans, struggling with stubbornly high unemployment, depressed home prices and tougher borrowing requirements, can take advantage of the lower rates to buy a home, or refinance.
Will the lower rates spur you to refinance -- or buy a house?
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: U.S. Attorneys In California Set Crackdown On Marijuana

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MEDINA

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- Federal officials on Friday warned dozens of marijuana dispensaries throughout California to shut down or face civil and criminal action as part of a major crackdown on the state's growing medical marijuana industry.
The four United States attorneys in California said that they would move against landlords who rent space to the storefront operators of medical marijuana dispensaries, whom prosecutors suspect of using the law to cover large-scale for-profit drug sales. The announcement, at a news conference in Sacramento, highlights the tension between the federal government and the state, which began making medical marijuana legal in 1996, the first to do so. Now, 15 other states have similar laws allowing medical marijuana.
But federal prosecutors said that in California, many people had simply used the law as a cover for large-scale drug operations, with tens of millions of dollars' worth of marijuana being sent across state lines from here. Officials said they would also concentrate on properties used to grow marijuana, particularly in the agriculturally rich central part of the state. 
''This is not what the California voters intended or authorized,'' said Andre Birotte Jr., the United States attorney in Los Angeles. ''It is illegal under California law.''
The Obama administration said in October 2009 that federal prosecutors would not prosecute individual patients who used marijuana or the operators that distributed it for medical reasons in a state where it had been legalized. ''It's a tremendous shift for them to say they are going to do this,'' said Morgan Fox, a spokesman for the Marijuana Policy Project, which advocates the legalization of the drug for medical and nonmedical use. ''But for now it is still threats. Until we start seeing the shutdowns themselves, it's hard to know what it means more than rhetoric.''
Mr. Birotte said that the storefronts in many cities were more like Wal-Mart or Costco than medical dispensaries. To illustrate the problem, he pointed to an Orange County building with eight stores selling marijuana.
''Some will allow you to consume the marijuana right there and then presumably leave and drive,'' said Melinda Haag, the United States attorney in San Francisco. She said that several dispensaries accepted only cash and placed A.T.M.'s in the stores. ''There's no wonder that there are guards here -- where there is marijuana, there is a lot of money.''
Advocates for medical marijuana say that the crackdown is unlikely to have any impact on the amount of marijuana coming through the state but will instead push people who have a legitimate need into the underground market.
''They are really pushing people into the illicit market,'' said Kris Hermes, a spokesman for Americans for Safe Access. ''This is federal interference for thousands of patients in the state.''
A laissez-faire approach to marijuana permeates much of the state. In many cities, it is not unusual to see dispensaries advertising late-night specials and bulk packages of marijuana-laced brownies and other food products. The West Coast Cannabis Expo, a three-day event billed partly as a ''job fair to promote employment opportunities in the medical marijuana industry,'' began in San Francisco on Friday.
Officials said that each of the four regions would handle the crackdown slightly differently. In the central district, which includes Los Angeles, prosecutors intend to concentrate on cities where residents and officials have expressed vocal opposition to the dispensaries. Ms. Haag said that in Northern California, the efforts will center on areas near schools and parks, but added that ''we will almost certainly be taking action against others.''
Federal prosecutors also said Friday that as part of the crackdown, they had charged six people in a suspected marijuana trafficking ring based in North Hollywood that made $15 million in eight months. But officials repeatedly said that they would not focus on individual patients.
''Large commercial operations cloak their money-making activities in the guise of helping sick people when they are in fact helping themselves,'' said Benjamin B. Wagner, the United States attorney in Sacramento. ''Our interest is in enforcing federal criminal law, not prosecuting seriously ill sick people and those who are caring for them.''

HEADLINE: In France and Germany, Divergence On How to Recapitalize Their Banks

BYLINE: By JACK EWING AND STEPHEN CASTLE

 BODY:
European leaders are finally coming around to the view that banks must be compelled to replenish their capital reserves if the euro area is ever to emerge from the debt crisis. But whether the politicians can make it happen in a convincing manner is another question -- especially given that Germany and France are already divided.
Analysts are skeptical that even the richest countries will be able to agree on guidelines for a broad, coordinated effort, one impressive enough to remove all doubts about solvency in the event of a default by Greece or another sovereign debtor.
In the first signs of a split, France wants to draw on the European bailout fund, the European Financial Stability Facility, to rebuild bank capital. German leaders think national governments should take the lead. 
''Only if a country can't do it on its own should the E.F.S.F. be used,'' Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Friday.
But the sums required to armor banks against losses on government bonds -- up to 300 billion euros, or about $400 billion, by some estimates -- could jeopardize France's top-notch credit rating. That would be a big political setback for President Nicolas Sarkozy before elections next May.
These kinds of arguments are just what economists fear. A parochial approach will lead countries to try to seek advantage for their own institutions, as has often been the pattern in the past, critics say. In addition, most large European banks have extensive operations and therefore require pan-European oversight, they argue.
''You need to have a European approach, which is tremendously difficult politically,'' said Nicolas Veron, a senior fellow at Bruegel, a research organization in Brussels. ''If it doesn't happen, I am not very optimistic about the ability of European authorities to keep the crisis under control.''
When Fitch Ratings cut Spain's credit rating Friday by two levels, to AA- from AA+, it cited the ''intensification'' of the debt crisis along with slower growth and shaky regional finances, Bloomberg News reported. Fitch cited similar reasons for also downgrading Italy one level, to A+, while maintaining Portugal at BBB-, saying it would complete a review of that ranking in the fourth quarter.
Meanwhile, grave problems at the French-Belgian bank Dexia, which is on the verge of its second taxpayer-financed bailout in three years, have dashed any illusions about the health of European banks. It was only in July that Dexia breezed through an official stress test that was supposed to expose vulnerable banks.
It has become obvious that restoring the soundness of European banks is fundamental to resolving the debt crisis and removing a serious threat to the global economy. Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, has been urging a wholesale recapitalization for several months. In the United States, President Obama warned on Thursday that ''the problems Europe is having right now could have a very real effect on our economy.''
But no one has provided even rough details of how to compel banks to raise money on open markets if they can, and to provide government financing if they can't.
''Our experience is that if no one is talking about the details of something, it is because they do not exist,'' Carl Weinberg, chief economist of High Frequency Economics, wrote in a note to clients Friday. ''Let us just agree that there is no plan.''
Mrs. Merkel and Mr. Sarkozy are expected to discuss the issue when they meet in Berlin on Sunday, along with their finance ministers. The European Commission expects to produce its proposal for a coordinated recapitalization within a week.
Even if Dexia proves to be an isolated case, it is clear that investor confidence in the solvency of European banks is at a low ebb. European banks are reluctant to lend to one another, and United States lenders are reluctant to lend to European institutions. Banks have been unable to sell bonds to raise money.
The danger is that European banks will run short of cash to lend to businesses and consumers, amplifying a recession that may already be under way. And in a vicious cycle, the threat of recession is further undermining faith in banks. Investors know that a recession will cause a surge in bad loans, adding to the potential damage if Greece defaults on its bonds.
''The problem is not just bank capital, but first and foremost that of sovereign debt crisis intertwined with slow growth,'' the Institute of International Finance, a banking industry organization, wrote in its monthly assessment of global capital markets. The report noted that shares of United States banks had begun to suffer because of perceptions that they are exposed to their European peers.
On Thursday, the European Central Bank expanded its aid to banks that were having trouble raising money. It said it would allow banks to borrow as much money as they wanted for about a year at the benchmark interest rate, currently 1.5 percent. And it said it would spend 40 billion euros on a low-risk form of bank debt known as covered bonds.
But, as Jean-Claude Trichet, the departing president, warned, the central bank can provide only temporary aid. The central bank is addressing banks' liquidity problems -- their need for cash day to day. But the E.C.B. cannot fix banks' solvency problems, the lack of adequate reserves to absorb a big hit to their holdings of government bonds or losses from nonperforming loans.
Before money market funds and other investors will start risking money on European banks again, they need to believe the banks are bulletproof.
Calculations of how much more capital banks need depend on judgments about how bad things may get. Jon Peace, a banking analyst at Nomura, counts at least 25 large publicly traded banks that would need more capital if they fully recognized losses in the value of their holdings of European government bonds. The list includes big names like Commerzbank and Deutsche Bank in Germany, UniCredit in Italy, and Societe Generale and BNP Paribas in France.
In addition, there may be dozens, if not hundreds, of other undercapitalized banks that fall below the radar of analysts because they do not have publicly traded shares, like German landesbanks, or because they are too small.
Larger institutions like Deutsche Bank or UniCredit would probably be able to sell new shares. But with bank share prices depressed, it is not an opportune time for even the most credible banks to go to markets.
European leaders plan to debate the issue on Oct. 17 and 18 in Brussels. In addition, governments have asked the European Banking Authority to prepare its own estimate of bank capital needs. Finance ministers have agreed to share information on their own capacity to finance aid to banks when they meet next month.
Given the weight of opinion in the euro zone, the European Commission is likely to side with Mrs. Merkel and argue that the bailout fund should be used for bank recapitalization only as a last resort -- unless Mr. Sarkozy can persuade the chancellor otherwise on Sunday.
Germany's position puts France in a tight spot, though. French banks are some of the most exposed to troubled government debt. Relatively small increases in capital reserves are unlikely to convince the financial markets. But if France were to lose its triple-A credit rating, that would also cause problems for the bailout fund, since France is the second-largest guarantor of the rescue fund, after Germany.
''Merkel has made it clear that she doesn't see why German taxpayers' money should be used to rescue French banks which are in competition with her own,'' said an official in Brussels, who declined to be quoted by name. ''France argues that it has made substantial guarantees to the fund and thinks it should be able to use it.''

HEADLINE: Modest Growth In Jobs Tempers Recession Fears

BYLINE: By MOTOKO RICH; Jennifer Steinhauer and Michael Shear contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
American companies are adding jobs slowly and unevenly, just enough to plug the dike against a wave of fears that the economy could slip back into recession.
But with a ballooning European debt crisis sending ripples across the Atlantic and anxiety continuing over the tortured political landscape here, there is little indication that American employers will hire enough to put the millions of unemployed people back to work any time soon.
The Labor Department said Friday that American employers added 103,000 net new jobs in September, indicating that the economy is at least not weakening and that businesses have weathered the oil price shocks and the Japanese disaster-related supply chain disruptions earlier this year. 
The government also revised its estimates upward for the previous two months, suggesting that job growth in the summer was better than originally reported. Still, the Labor Department's monthly snapshot captures the economic challenges as President Obama continues to press Congress to pass his jobs bill.
The economy is not growing fast enough to bring down the unemployment rate, which held steady at 9.1 percent in September. Local governments and school districts are cutting large numbers of workers. And about a third of the jobs added by the private sector last month were actually 45,000 Verizon workers who had been on strike during August and were simply returning to work.
More than two years after the recovery officially began, 14 million people are searching for work, a little less than half of them for at least six months.
The employment numbers for last month were ''certainly not consistent with recession,'' said Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist at MFR. But ''it's certainly not off to the races, and in absolute terms it is still very, very weak.''
The tepid jobs report provided more ammunition for Mr. Obama's Republican rivals, who seized on Friday's results as further evidence of what they say is the president's ineffective stewardship of the economy.
Large-scale job losses might have offered Mr. Obama help in pressuring Congress on his jobs bill. Strong growth in employment would help counter criticism from Republican presidential candidates. But the so-so results merely add to his dilemma.
''The president is offering only bad medicine -- higher taxes, more spending, more dubious 'green jobs' boondoggles, and more tactical blame-gaming,'' Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota said in a statement from her presidential campaign.
The rhetoric from Capitol Hill was equally critical. ''Across the country, millions of people remain out of work, and uncertainty from Washington continues to freeze capital and prevent businesses small and large from hiring,'' said Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the House majority leader.
In an interview, Gene Sperling, Mr. Obama's chief economic adviser, said that critics of the jobs plan offered no viable alternative. ''For anyone in Washington to look at an economy with 9.1 percent unemployment and projections that growth will be too weak to even improve it to then argue that we should sit on our hands and just do nothing is simply inexcusable,'' Mr. Sperling said.
Some recent data paint a slightly better picture of the economy. Auto sales rose nearly 10 percent in September to their highest level in five months, and sales at chain stores increased last month, led by luxury purchases.
Still, the housing market is teetering and the number of people filing weekly for unemployment insurance remains high. The average length of unemployment rose to 40.5 weeks last month. Including those who are working part time because they cannot find full-time employment and those who are too discouraged to look for work anymore, the total unemployment rate rose to 16.5 percent last month.
Some economists worried that the headline on the September jobs report was not galvanizing enough for the president's agenda. ''Policy is running out of ammunition and the willingness here, particularly with today's number, may be even less to do anything dramatic,'' said Torsten Slok, chief international economist at Deutsche Bank.
''The optimists could argue that now we don't need any more support because we have at least some evidence that the economy is not falling apart completely,'' Mr. Slok continued.
The markets were underwhelmed by Friday's report. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index eased down less than 1 percent to 1,115.46, and the Dow Jones industrial average ended the day basically flat.
As has been the case throughout most of the weak recovery, health care was one of the strongest sectors, along with professional and business services. Manufacturing, which had shown job growth for more than a year, lost 13,000 jobs in September.
The weakest results were in the public sector, with local government shedding 35,000 jobs, 24,400 of them in public education. Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, said that about 277,000 education jobs had been lost since 2008 and projected as many as 280,000 more job losses in the next year from state and local budget cuts.
In Broward County, Fla., where the school district let go or did not renew the contracts of more than 1,000 teachers last May, Cherine Akbari, an 11th-grade American history teacher who was let go, has been steadily applying for jobs. Ms. Akbari, 28, is collecting about $1,000 a month in unemployment benefits, not enough to cover her monthly mortgage payment. In a twist of bad timing, she moved into her townhouse -- bought out of foreclosure -- just five days before receiving her layoff notice.
''Luckily I had some money saved up, but with the unemployment and my bills, I'm losing a little money each month,'' said Ms. Akbari, who has been applying for jobs in public relations and advertising. She has yet to receive an offer, she said.
Other precursors of future hiring, like temporary employment, showed modest improvement last month. Temporary help services added 19,400 jobs. The average weekly hours worked, which tend to climb before companies start hiring again, rose slightly, as did average weekly earnings.
Allen L. Sinai, chief global economist at Decision Economics, a consulting firm, said he supported the president's jobs plan and estimated it could lead to 600,000 new jobs. Other economists have said it could create as many as 1.9 million jobs.
Right now, even profitable companies are reluctant to hire in Mr. Sinai's view. ''C.E.O.'s are paid to grow shareholder value,'' he said. ''They are not paid to hire people if demand isn't there and if they can substitute machines for people. That's a no-brainer for the people who run companies.''

HEADLINE: European Commission Backs Microsoft Deal to Buy Skype

BYLINE: By KEVIN J. O'BRIEN

 BODY:
BERLIN -- The European Commission on Friday approved Microsoft's $8.5 billion purchase of Skype, saying it had no objections to a deal that would link the world's largest software maker with the leading Internet communications service.
While the assent from the European competition commissioner, Joaquin Almunia, is not the final antitrust hurdle for the transaction -- regulators in Russia, Ukraine, Serbia and Taiwan are still deliberating -- the positive review from Brussels was considered the last significant threat to what would be Microsoft's largest takeover to date. 
The U.S. Federal Trade Commission approved the transaction in June.
In voicing no objections to the deal, Mr. Almunia, a Spanish economist, chose not to act on a complaint from an Italian competitor to Skype, Messagenet of Milan, which had asked that the deal be blocked unless Microsoft opened Skype's 124-million user network to competitors.
Mr. Almunia in February approved Microsoft's purchase of the search advertising business of Yahoo. This time, the competition commissioner said he was approving the purchase of Skype ''because the deal would not significantly impede effective competition,'' according to a statement by his office.
In the consumer communications business, the commission said Microsoft and Skype overlapped only in video communications, which Microsoft offers separately through its Windows Live Messenger program.
''However, the commission considers that there are no competition concerns in this growing market where numerous players, including Google, are present,'' the commission said in its statement.
In the sale of Internet communications to businesses, Skype had only ''a limited presence,'' the commission concluded, which did not overlap with Microsoft's Lync Internet communications software, used by large companies.
Microsoft, in a statement, called the European approval ''an important milestone. We look forward to completing the final steps needed to close the acquisition.''
The approval from Brussels will expedite the fusion of Microsoft, maker of the ubiquitous Windows computer operating system and Office business application suite, with Skype, an Internet seller of free and low-cost audio and video telephony founded in 2003 by Niklas Zennstrom, a Swede, and Janus Friis of Denmark.
During the past eight years, Skype has become the largest provider of Internet-based communications. But profitability has remained elusive.
A previous owner, eBay, which bought Skype for an estimated $2.6 billion in October 2005, was not able to integrate Skype profitably into its online auction business. In October 2007, eBay took a $1.4 billion impairment charge reflecting what it estimated that it had overpaid for Skype.
Last November, eBay sold a 70 percent stake in Skype to an investor group led by Silver Lake Partners for an estimated $2 billion.
Microsoft, which announced its agreement to buy Skype on May 10, is paying nearly three times Skype's market value, as measured by the sale of eBay's stake almost a year ago to private investors.
Leif-Olof Wallin, an analyst in Stockholm for Gartner, said Microsoft would use Skype to bolster its push into Internet-based telephony around its Lync software for businesses. With Skype's huge user base, Microsoft will be able to greatly expand the availability of low-cost Internet telephony, Mr. Wallin said.
He added that Microsoft's distribution of Skype through its Windows operating system would improve the image of Internet calling, especially among businesses, which are increasingly encouraging workers to use their own computers and software for company business.
That will make Microsoft more of a direct competitive threat to Cisco Systems and Avaya, the two biggest companies that sell Internet-based telephone service software for businesses.
But it will also accelerate downward pressure on long-distance and international calling prices, Mr. Wallin said.
''Once it is preloaded on a device, whether it is a computer or a phone, it becomes more convenient to use,'' Mr. Wallin said. ''That will make consumers more likely to discover and try it.''
Whether Microsoft can generate a profit from Skype, or create profitable synergies with its other software services and products remains unclear, said David W. Cearley, an analyst for Gartner in Stamford, Connecticut.
''I do not believe that direct revenue was the main reason for the purchase,'' Mr. Cearley said. ''The main thing that Microsoft is buying with Skype is brand presence on the Web and a customer base.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: In Iowa, Ethanol Can Still Trip Up a Candidate

BYLINE: By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.

 BODY:
Even in Iowa, King Corn is not all that it used to be. But can it still make a presidential candidate waffle?
Few major presidential aspirants have declared themselves an enemy of corn-based ethanol quite like Gov. Rick Perry of Texas. Three years ago, he unsuccessfully tried to bulldoze a federal law that, in effect, forces billions of bushels of corn to be converted into ethanol and added to gasoline. He argued that this law forced up the price of corn used to feed cattle and chicken, adversely affecting Texas livestock producers. These included powerful campaign donors like the East Texas chicken tycoon Lonnie Pilgrim, who had pressured Mr. Perry to fight the mandate.
In Governor Perry's then-unambiguous view, the federal law has done ''significant harm'' to American households. ''Any government mandate that artificially props up a single industry to the detriment of millions of Americans is bad public policy,'' he said. 
But when Mr. Perry, as a Republican presidential candidate, was asked about the ethanol mandate at an Iowa Corn Growers Association meeting in late August, he ducked the issue and would not answer questions. His evasiveness did not sit well with farmers, but the association's chief lobbyist, Mindy Larsen Poldberg, was somewhat encouraged.
''He didn't say, 'No, I don't support it,' or 'Yes, I would support it,' '' she said. ''I wouldn't say that right now he is against ethanol.''
It remains unclear whether Mr. Perry still opposes the ethanol mandate and was merely avoiding a politically awkward issue, or whether he might have been carving out room to change his position.
Either way, his sudden public equivocation after years of opposition suggests that ethanol retains not just potency as an issue in Iowa's presidential caucuses, but also its power to distort national energy policy, which derives from the state's crucial first-in-the-nation voting and the vastly disproportionate weight and attention presidential candidates give its voters.
The caucuses are shaping up as particularly crucial for Mr. Perry, who was trailing far behind Mitt Romney in polls in New Hampshire, the other early-voting state, even before coming under fire in the last debate over issues like immigration. He arrived in Iowa on Friday and is to campaign there on Saturday.
Some other candidates have also opposed policies promoting ethanol, and even a spokeswoman for Mr. Romney, who supports ''the subsidy of ethanol,'' declined to say whether he supported the mandate -- a different issue altogether from ethanol's major subsidy, which is slated to expire soon anyway.
But for Mr. Perry and other candidates who have criticized ethanol subsidies there is also a silver lining: The issue may not have the full political force it once did, when opposition was equated with political suicide. After Jon M. Huntsman Jr., a former Utah governor, announced in June that he would not compete in Iowa, saying his ethanol opposition meant he could never do well there, a survey by the Iowa pollster J. Ann Selzer suggested that he might have given up too soon.
Only 14 percent of likely Republican and independent caucus voters, she found, described a candidate's opposition to subsidies as a ''deal-killer.'' Three out of four said either that it would be ''no real problem'' or that it was something they would consider among other factors.
Iowa's economy is now centered more on health insurers, banks and other industries than corn, Ms. Selzer said, despite the boom in farm incomes and cropland values. And many caucus voters have soured on government subsidies, which are seen as fiscally unsound, even those that benefit neighbors.
''Subsidies are a dirty word with a lot of conservative Republicans,'' she said. ''It's the politicians who don't seem to understand the role of ethanol in Iowa.''
As the politics have changed, so, too, has the industry, up to a point. When Tim Pawlenty, then a candidate, announced his opposition to ethanol subsidies in May, he won plaudits for what was called a courageous stand. But industry officials say Mr. Pawlenty, a former Minnesota governor, was not saying anything much different from an industry-backed compromise that had already been hashed out by one of ethanol's most powerful supporters in Washington, Senator Charles E. Grassley, an Iowa Republican.
Until recently, the industry had zealously protected two federal government perks: a 45-cent federal tax credit for every gallon of ethanol blended into gasoline, and a tariff of 54 cents a gallon aimed at Brazilian sugar cane-based ethanol. But recession and deficits wore away political support, and both are set to expire at the end of the year.
What the industry still has, though, is far more valuable: the federal mandate that, this year alone, will effectively require almost 40 percent of American corn to be used to make ethanol for gasoline.
It is this law -- the one Mr. Perry, at least until recently, excoriated -- that ''is now clearly the bedrock issue'' for the ethanol industry, said Monte Shaw, executive director of the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association. Ethanol opponents also have this mandate in their sights, and have filed legislation to either eliminate it or suspend it when supplies of corn are running low.
The main reason to get rid of it, they say, is that it drives up food costs, and they cite the tripling of corn prices over the last half-dozen years.
One expert, C. Ford Runge, a professor of applied economics at the University of Minnesota, estimated that ethanol accounted for at least 25 percent of the rise in corn prices. In the current environment, the ethanol industry needs the mandate, if not the tax credit and tariff, he said.
''Without any of these supports,'' Mr. Runge said, ''the industry would die a rapid death.''

BYLINE: By CHARLES M. BLOW

 BODY:
Let's get this out of the way: The presidential election is more than a year away, and things can and will change between now and then. Caveat: check!
BUT, and that's a big but, the way the Republican field is shaping up, it may be poised to squander an electoral opportunity of a historic scale.
Republicans simply can't find a competent, consistent candidate with whom they can fall in love and with which President Obama won't mop the floor. 
Their last glimmers of hope disappeared this week when both the Mama Grizzly from Alaska and the Papa Bear from New Jersey announced that they would not run.
That means this is it. Republicans are stuck with the group they have: The Imperfect 10. They are so lackluster that most people can't even name the front-runners. According to a poll released this week by the Pew Research Center, unlike in 2007, 1999 and 1995 when about half of Americans could name a Republican front-runner at this point in the campaign, this year little more than a quarter can.
This was supposed to be a cakewalk for Republican voters. Instead, they find themselves poring over a platter of options as dense as dough, as hollow as choux and as thin as phyllo.
This has to be incredibly frustrating. All the other conditions are ripe.
A Gallup report released on Friday found that President Obama's average approval ratings for September remained at the lowest point of his presidency: 41 percent.
The economy is stubbornly resisting resuscitation, and even the White House predicts that the unemployment rate will remain above 9 percent through Election Day. (No president in modern history has faced re-election with an unemployment rate that high.)
And Republican state legislators have been very successful at what Politico in June called their ''push to rig the 2012 presidential election'' by passing a raft of voting restrictions that will serve to disenfranchise many groups that normally vote Democratic.
A report released this week by the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law included these ominous findings:
The new laws are likely to make it ''significantly harder'' for more than five million eligible voters -- ''mostly young, minority, and low-income voters as well as voters with disabilities'' -- to cast ballots in 2012. They point out that that number is ''larger than the margin of victory in two of the last three presidential elections.''
''The states that have already cut back on voting rights will provide 171 electoral votes in 2012 -- 63 percent of the 270 needed to win the presidency.''
Most of the 2012 battleground states have either passed or are considering new restrictions. Some that have passed them are considering passing even more.
The White House should be the Republicans' for the taking. And it would look more likely if their current crop of front-runners weren't so utterly inept and fallible.
First, there's the resurgent front-runner: the plastic Massachusetts Ken Doll, Mitt Romney -- willing to bend into any position for a vote.
The last time Mitt-Ken ran for president, The Washington Post assembled a list of his greatest hits, and it was a wonder to behold. He was for abortion rights; then he wasn't. He was for strong gun laws; then he wasn't. He was against ''don't ask, don't tell''; then he wasn't. He was for campaign finance reform; then he wasn't. He was for ''reasonable'' immigration reform; then he wasn't.
This time around, he's positioning himself as the Great Right Defender of Social Security to run opposite Thick Rick Perry, the Texas governor who called it a Ponzi scheme. But Romney is on the record as having been open to the idea of privatizing the program himself.
Now he's hopping around the country in the Gap skinny jeans his wife bought him, trying to be down with the common folks, tweeting about flying Southwest and eating at Subway.
All the while he's nearly quadrupling -- or doubling if you follow his logic -- the size of his $12 million California vacation home.
Then there's Perry, who during the last debate was pushed back on his spurs. All of America had a chance to see what many have known from the beginning: that dog isn't smart enough to hunt. Ever since then he's been sinking in the polls. Adding to his troubles, The Washington Post revealed on Sunday that the Perry family leased a hunting camp with a most un-P.C. name, which sounds like a cover band for a Klan rally.
Lastly, there's Herman ''Big Daddy'' Cain, the former C.E.O. of Godfather's Pizza, who recently told Chris Wallace of Fox News that ''when'' he becomes president, he's going to remix ''Hail to the Chief,'' possibly with ''some gospel beats.'' He won the Florida straw poll and has surged ever since.
He has never been elected to public office and has demonstrated a woeful lack of understanding of international affairs. But what gets my goat is how he plays with the shiv of racism like a circus clown. He complains about people calling him names because he is a black conservative, while simultaneously offering up sweeping racial generalizations about other blacks. He describes the Democratic Party as a ''plantation'' and says that two-thirds of blacks are ''brainwashed'' into voting Democratic.
He has also raised the tired trope that Obama isn't black enough and that the news media is scared that he, ''a real black man,'' might run against Obama. When Jon Stewart mocked him for saying (''joking''?) that as president all bills would have to be three pages long, Cain accused Stewart of crossing the line by using the ''dialect of the old Amos 'n' Andy.'' Yet when shrugging off criticism, Cain quotes his grandfather using poor grammar: ''I does not care.'' What kind of dialect is that?
He says he wants to avoid racial politics, but he ensures that his campaign is soaked in racial politics.
If these are the best the Republicans have, they may miss their moment. Then again, there is that opening caveat.

HEADLINE: Revenge Of the Gougers

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA

 BODY:
The hardest part about writing about Bank of America's dunderheaded plan to impose a $5-a-month fee on debit card users is deciding which of the many juicy angles to pursue. ''Have Bank of America's Managers Lost Their Minds?'' asked The American Banker earlier this week. That's one good angle.
Then there's the ''are we really supposed to start using cash again?'' angle. Or the Durbin angle -- Senator Dick Durbin being the Illinois senator whose amendment to the new financial reform law, imposing a steep reduction in bank interchange fees, ''forced'' banks to search for ways to make up for the lost revenue. There's even a presidential angle, with President Obama saying on Monday that banks didn't have ''some inherent right'' to a certain level of profits -- and then more or less withdrawing the remark the next day. 
Me, I'm going with the gouging angle. The revenue that Bank of America, and many other banks, is seeking to replace with its new fees is lucre that a more honorable profession would never have touched in the first place. Indeed, 30 years ago, banks themselves would have turned their backs on it. Of course, back then, banks viewed customers as people to be helped, not marks to be taken advantage of.
It was, to be sure, a different world then, with regulated interest rates, the Glass-Steagall Act preventing banks from getting into lucrative trading and a sleepy business model that valued a steady dividend over a highflying stock price. As interest rates were deregulated, Glass-Steagall abolished and investors demanding that bank stocks perform like Internet stocks, that ethos changed. Banks began looking in some dark corners for new revenue; this is when hidden fees began to creep into credit-card agreements, for instance.
In retail banking, two new fees became crucial. One was overdraft fees, which gouged the least-sophisticated, least-wealthy customers by charging them $35 or so whenever their accounts were overdrawn.
The second source was interchange fees, which gouged merchants who accepted debit cards. Though merchants at first resisted debit cards, they eventually caved because banks made them so ubiquitous. Banks pushed debit cards in part because they are much less expensive to process than checks (which banks lose money on). But banks also got hooked on the absurdly high interchange fees they charged merchants -- an average of 44 cents per transaction, even though it costs literally pennies to process a debit-card transaction.
In the summer of 2010, the Federal Reserve told the banking industry it could no longer charge overdraft fees unless customers ''opted in.'' To its ever-lasting credit, Bank of America, unlike its competitors, did not run a big scare campaign to persuade customers to agree to the opt-in. It chose to forgo the revenue, which amounted to some $3.3 billion, according to Credit Suisse.
The Durbin amendment tackled interchange fees. It called on the Federal Reserve to cap the fees at a level that ''reasonably'' accounted for the cost of processing transactions. Although the Fed's final number was still ridiculously high -- well over 20 cents -- it will, nonetheless, cost Bank of America another $2 billion.
The news that Bank of America will impose the new debit card fee has infuriated many of its 50 million customers. But the bank insists that it's not trying to alienate its customer base. Rather, a spokesman told me, the fee is part of ''a much larger reconfiguration of our consumer business.'' Next year, it plans to roll out a series of new offerings, most of which will be fee-based. Customers will be able to evade the fees only by maintaining large balances at all times.
One suspects that these new fees will only generate more anger, for they will make plain what has long been hidden: that, fundamentally, retail banking makes its money by gouging the have-nots. Post-financial crisis, the essence of big banking has not changed. It's just become more obvious.
President Obama got it right the first time: Banks don't have an inherent right to oversized profits. No industry does. Banks play a special role in society, and they get special protections from the government. In return, government has the right to impose special responsibilities.
Every person needs a bank, no matter how rich or poor. The government will never force Bank of America -- or any other bank -- to reduce or eliminate its fees; it doesn't have the nerve. But, at the least, it could insist that banks display their fees in a uniform way so that customers can compare how they're being gouged and make banking decisions on that basis. That kind of reform could stir competition and bring down fees.
This, of course, is precisely what the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is supposed to do -- and would do if the Senate Republicans would ever allow a director to be approved.
But, sigh, that's a column for another day.

HEADLINE: Elections May Decide Strength of Poland's European Ties

BYLINE: By JUDY DEMPSEY and NICHOLAS KULISH

 BODY:
BERLIN -- Poles are set to vote on Sunday in elections that could well determine whether the country continues its deepening cooperation with European Union allies under Prime Minister Donald Tusk or lurches back toward a more confrontational course under its former leader.
The parliamentary elections on Sunday pit Mr. Tusk against his predecessor, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the leader of the nationalist-conservative Law and Justice Party. A fight over anti-German comments by Mr. Kaczynski in the prelude to the elections served as a stark reminder of his years as prime minister, when he appeared to relish his role as the European Union's in-house troublemaker. 
In 2007, Mr. Kaczynski was defeated by Mr. Tusk, who steered Poland to closer ties with Germany and the rest of Europe. While relations with the United States remained warm, Mr. Tusk's government was less reflexively pro-American, removing the last of Poland's troops from Iraq in 2008.
In his recently published book, ''The Poland of Our Dreams,'' Mr. Kaczynski claimed that the Stasi, the former East German secret police, had helped Angela Merkel, who was raised in East Germany, to gain power. ''I don't think that the awarding of the chancellorship to Angela Merkel was pure chance,'' Mr. Kaczynski wrote.
The former prime minister, the twin brother of President Lech Kaczynski, who was killed along with many top members of his government last year in a plane crash in Smolensk, Russia, also wrote that Mrs. Merkel wanted to reinstate Germany's imperial power through a strategic axis with Russia. Bronislaw Komorowski, the Polish president, demanded that Mr. Kaczynski apologize.
Poland has a dark history of being conquered and divided by larger powers, especially Russia and Germany. Many Poles remain mistrustful of both countries, and suspect a Russian conspiracy was behind the devastating plane crash that killed Mr. Kaczynski's brother.
The near certainty of Vladimir V. Putin's return as Russia's president has stoked fears among Poles. And the European Union, which Mr. Tusk has so strongly supported, looks ever weaker and more fractured as the European debt crisis begins to boil over and the future of the euro currency is called into question.
Mr. Tusk has had the benefit of leading a country that has mostly escaped the worst of the European financial crises. Poland is one of the few European countries that did not slide into recession during the global financial crisis of 2008-9. And because it is not a member of the euro zone group, it has remained largely insulated from any contagion from the woes of Greece and other deeply indebted big borrowers.
Though analysts believe that the race is still too close to predict the outcome, Mr. Tusk's governing party, Civic Platform, holds a 10-percentage-point lead over Law and Justice in opinion polls.
''Foreign policy does not win votes,'' said Pawel Baginski, an analyst at the Stefan Batory Foundation in Warsaw. Mr. Baginski added: ''What is in the minds of so many people is the economy. The party that wins power after Sunday will have to deal with potential problems arising from the euro crisis.''
Instead of responding to Mr. Kaczynski's nationalist talk, Mr. Tusk has run a campaign that could represent a turning point in Poland's post-Communist era, said Pawel Swieboda, president of demosEuropa, an independent research group in Warsaw. Mr. Tusk has been crisscrossing Poland in his campaign bus. Rather than giving set speeches, he has mingled in crowds, asking people what they want and what they think.
''It's a kind of listening campaign, and so far, it seems to be working,'' Mr. Swieboda said. If Mr. Tusk manages to win as a result, it will be the first time since Poland's first post-Communist elections that a leader will be elected to a second consecutive term.
But Mr. Tusk may face new challenges as Poland's economic boom is expected to fade, according to the World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which forecast a slowing in growth over the coming year.
The economy grew 4.3 percent during the second quarter of this year but is expected to slow in the coming months as a result of the slowdown across the European Union. Unemployment has increased to 11.6 percent for the month of August from around 10 percent last year.
''The message from Tusk's campaign is clear,'' Mr. Swieboda said. ''We are stepping into very difficult waters. At the moment we are doing fine. But the circumstances outside are becoming more difficult.''

HEADLINE: 672 School Jobs Are Lost in Largest Single-Agency Layoff Under Bloomberg

BYLINE: By FERNANDA SANTOS; Anna M. Phillips contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Some of them spent the past few days scouring the wanted ads on the New York City Department of Education's Web site. Others made sure they learned how to file for unemployment.
Of the 777 New York City school employees who were sent pink slips two weeks ago, 672 lost their jobs on Friday in the largest single-agency layoff since Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg took office in 2002.
While the city managed to avert the layoffs of thousands of teachers in June by brokering an agreement with their union, it could not find a way to spare the school aides, parent coordinators, family workers and others who work in support jobs at roughly 350 schools. 
In a statement, the schools chancellor, Dennis M. Walcott, said the union representing the workers, District Council 37, had squandered its chances to make a deal of its own last spring by rejecting a plan to give the city access to its health care fund to balance its books.
''I am sympathetic to these workers,'' Mr. Walcott said. ''But in part because other unions would not work with us to find more savings, schools have to absorb cuts to their budgets, and from there our principals made the best staffing decisions for their students.''
District Council 37 made three proposals to the city that included giving up paid holidays and reducing the maximum number of hours school aides were allowed to work as ways to save money. The city rejected all of them.
Union leaders, dressed in black as if in mourning, kept the pressure up until the last minute, holding a lunchtime rally Friday on the steps of City Hall to denounce the layoffs as political payback, a characterization city officials have dismissed.
For days, the leaders had been urging elected officials to intervene on behalf of the workers. Some of them took action. The City Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, spoke to Mr. Bloomberg by phone, and 17 of the Council's 51 members signed a letter to the mayor that said, ''The constant attack on our education system will continue to burden the most vulnerable population of this city -- our children.''
Officials at the Education Department, meanwhile, combed through the list of layoffs, seeking to match workers to vacancies at other schools. The process helped a small fraction of them, but with more cuts due, the relief may be short-lived.
A letter sent to workers who were spared from layoffs after the department placed them in other jobs read, ''Please note that going forward, there may be a second round of layoffs.''
The union has vowed to fight on. At the rally, Santos Crespo, president of District Council 37's Local 372, which counts most of the laid-off workers among its members, said, ''We are going to continue this fight until they're all brought back.''
But Mr. Walcott has said he will not reverse decisions made by principals, who cut some of the workers while trimming their budgets.
The laid-off workers are among the city's lowest paid. School aides make $14 an hour for four to eight hours of work a day, while parent coordinators and family workers are salaried employees whose pay is about $35,000 a year, according to union representatives.
This week, the Bloomberg administration asked agencies to cut 2 percent from their budgets for the current fiscal year, then 6 percent from the budgets for next year.
The Council has called a hearing on Tuesday to ask officials if dismissing the workers could have been avoided had the Education Department chosen to cut other expenses. Henry Garrido, an associate director at District Council 37, said at the rally that the department's contracts budget had increased by $700 million last year, climbing to $4.4 billion in the school year that began last month.
Council members will also examine the disproportionate impact the layoffs will have on poor students and struggling schools, including 19 that are receiving millions of dollars in federal financing to improve their academic performance.
Councilwoman Letitia James, who represents an area that includes a school district that will lose roughly 15 percent of its school aides and other support staff, said at the City Hall rally, ''The fact is that the decision this administration is making'' will magnify inequalities.
School aides have been a recurrent target of layoffs. In the 2008-9 school year, 503 lost their jobs. Last year, an infusion of federal dollars averted layoffs, but some 410 aides were laid off on Friday. The other cuts include 82 family workers, whose role includes helping students resolve attendance issues, and 66 parent coordinators, who serve as liaisons between families and school administrators.
Most of the coordinators who lost their jobs were assigned to high schools, which, unlike elementary and middle schools, are not required to have them on staff.
Sungmi Kang, 47, is one of them. She had worked at Stuyvesant High School in Lower Manhattan until Friday, translating materials from English into Korean for immigrants whose children attend school there. Another, Regina Dudley, had been employed by the High School for Global Citizenship in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, since 2003.
''When I'm on lunch, if I see kids in the street, I want to know why they're there,'' Ms. Dudley said. ''I call parents to find out why children don't come to school.''
City teachers who are laid off are required by contract to be placed in a reserve pool and reassigned. This year, for example, teachers in reserve will be assigned as short-term substitutes, working on a weekly rotation in different schools under a plan that education officials said would save $40 million.
But there is no holding place for school support workers, who must leave the system if no school will employ them.
The teachers' union broke its silence on the layoffs on Friday, when its secretary, Michael Mendel, joined the lunchtime rally and said: ''If it takes a village to raise a child, then these people are certainly part of that village. And no one is going to convince me that they couldn't find the money to save them.''

HEADLINE: Disney Deal Keeps Iger At the Top

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES

 BODY:
7:40 p.m. Updated
LOS ANGELES - Robert A. Iger, Disney's chief executive, has signed a new contract that keeps him at the helm until March 2015. But he will then move to a lesser role for a year before leaving Disney entirely, the company said Friday.
It is unusual for a company to flag a chief's departure so far in advance, and the decision by Disney, the world's largest entertainment company, to do so could invite distraction as senior executives scramble to position themselves as successors. But Disney characterized the move as an effort to lock up Mr. Iger for as long as possible while signaling a careful succession strategy to Wall Street, which has criticized the lack of clear continuity planning at rival media companies like the News Corporation. 
By specifying the terms of Mr. Iger's eventual exit, Disney may also be trying to impose order on a process that became publicly messy the last time it changed leaders. Mr. Iger took control of the Walt Disney Company in 2005 after a bitter dispute between his predecessor, Michael D. Eisner, and Roy E. Disney, the nephew of the company's founder.
Disney declined to name possible candidates to succeed Mr. Iger. However, the company likes to promote from within and at the moment there appear to be two main candidates: James A. Rasulo, Disney's chief financial officer and former theme park chairman; and Thomas O. Staggs, now the theme park chairman and formerly the chief financial officer. (The two men switched roles at Mr. Iger's behest in 2009.)
In a telephone interview, John E. Pepper, Disney's chairman, underscored the board's approval with Mr. Iger's stewardship. ''He's as fresh as a daisy - people can get tired when you're as busy as he is, you know,'' Mr. Pepper said. ''We were extremely anxious to have him continue.''
A Disney spokeswoman said Mr. Iger was unavailable for an interview.
Under the new contract, completed at a board meeting on Thursday, Mr. Iger will gain the title of chairman in March of next year, succeeding Mr. Pepper, who will step down after having served four years in that job. In March 2015, Disney's board will name a new chief and Mr. Iger will become executive chairman.
Mr. Iger will then leave Disney on June 30, 2016. He started his entertainment career at the Disney-owned ABC in 1974. Mr. Iger will be 65 upon his departure; Disney's mandatory retirement age for board members is 74.
Since chief executives are typically pulled from their corner offices kicking and screaming, attention will focus on what Mr. Iger has planned for his long-term future. There has long been speculation that he has political ambitions, possibly in New York, where he grew up and worked early in his career.
Since becoming Disney's chief executive in 2005, Mr. Iger has mostly kept the company sailing smoothly through a cluster of storms, chiefly the recession, which hammered television advertising sales and threatened the company's theme parks. Despite some messy quarters, Disney's results for the last fiscal year were strong; net income rose 20 percent, to $3.96 billion, from $3.31 billion.
Mr. Iger's accomplishments include the acquisitions of Pixar Animation Studios and Marvel Entertainment and securing approval from the Chinese government (after decades of efforts) for a sprawling theme park in Shanghai. ESPN, a Disney unit, continues to surge, and other cable properties, notably ABC Family, have also grown stronger.
Mr. Iger, whose steady demeanor is a personal trademark, also helped to refocus and calm Disney's ranks after the turbulence of Mr. Eisner's tenure. Notably, he repaired the company's relationship with Roy Disney.
But there is plenty of work still to do. Disney has been inconsistent when it comes to adapting to new technology - on the one hand it was the first media company to make television shows available on iTunes and on the other it struggled to turn around its unprofitable online division. ABC needs to find new hits, and a turnaround at Disney's movie studio is still a work in progress.
Mr. Iger's new contract, which replaces one that still had two years before expiring, contains notable changes to his compensation. His base annual salary will increase 25 percent, to $2.5 million, with a higher annual bonus target. But unlike his previous contract, this one does not provide an upfront stock-option grant as an additional signing bonus; the previous contract provided one valued at $25 million.
Mr. Iger's salary and bonus last year was about $16 million. His total compensation, including equity awards, was about $28 million, according to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

BYLINE: By NADA BAKRI

 BODY:
BEIRUT, Lebanon -- Syrian security forces on Friday attacked two prominent opposition leaders, shooting one to death in the north and beating another in broad daylight in the heart of the capital, Damascus, activists said.
Mashaal Tammo, 53, a leading Kurdish political figure, was killed by four masked gunmen who stormed his house in Qamishli, in northern Syria, activists said. His son, Marcel, and another activist, Zahida Rashkilo, were wounded. Both are members of the liberal Kurdish Future Movement Party, which Mr. Tammo founded and which considers the minority Kurdish community an integral component of Syrian society.
In Damascus, Riad Seif, a dissident and a former political prisoner, was beaten by government security operatives as he left Al Hassan Mosque in the neighborhood of Midan, activists said. 
The official Syrian Arab News Agency carried a strikingly different account of Mr. Tammo's death, calling him a ''nationalistic opposition leader'' who was assassinated by ''gunmen in a black car.''
Basma Kodmani, a spokeswoman of the newly formed opposition group, the Syrian National Council, said President Bashar al-Assad's government had ''crossed a new stage in the strategy of repression. All opposition leaders must protect themselves.'' Mr. Seif and Mr. Tammo were both members of the group.
The attacks came as Russia, an ally of Syria that blocked a resolution condemning Damascus' crackdown at the United Nations this week, called on Mr. Assad to either change his ways or leave office, joining a chorus of countries alienated by Mr. Assad's violent suppression of the uprising against him.
''If the Syrian leadership is incapable of conducting such reforms, it will have to go,'' said President Dmitri A. Medvedev, in remarks reported by Russian news agencies. ''But this decision should be taken not in NATO or certain European countries. It should be taken by the Syrian people and the Syrian leadership.''
Washington welcomed the shift in Russia's position, but a State Department official said that the United States would like to see Russia and other countries exert pressure on Syria by imposing economic sanctions.
''That is very positive,'' said Victoria Nuland, a State Department spokeswoman, on Friday. ''But as we have said, we want to see more countries join us not only in increasing the political and rhetorical pressure on the regime, but also tightening the economic noose.''
The White House press secretary, Jay Carney, said in a statement that the attacks on Mr. Tammo and Mr. Seif represented ''the Syrian regime's latest attempt to shut down peaceful opposition inside Syria. President Assad must step down now before taking his country further down this very dangerous path.''
A Syrian protester reached by telephone in Damascus said the beating of Mr. Seif reflected the government's anxiety about the opposition's influence. ''He is one of the few members of the National Council inside Syria and this scares the regime,'' said the protester, who gave his name as Ammar.
Activists also said that at least eight people were killed elsewhere across Syria as protesters took to the streets after Friday's midday prayers.
The United Nations said this week that at least 2,900 people have been killed since the uprising started in March. The United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child said the toll included at least 187 children.
Mr. Assad's government has contended that the uprising is really a crime wave by gangs backed by hostile foreign powers. In keeping with that argument, the deputy foreign minister, Faisal Mekdad, said on Friday that his country had opened an investigation into the killings of 1,100 members of Syria's security forces. Mr. Mekdad, speaking from Geneva where he was attending a meeting of the United Nations Human Rights Council, denied reports that the Syrian Army was shooting deserters and accused other nations of arming protesters.

HEADLINE: In G.O.P. Race, Foreign Policy Is a Footnote

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER and ASHLEY PARKER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Herman Cain suggested that Israel's conservative prime minister would be open to allowing Palestinians right of return to the lands they fled in what is now Israel. Gov. Rick Perry suggested it was possible that American troops could be sent to Mexico if drug violence there got worse. And former Senator Rick Santorum offered that the United States should engage with the ousted Pakistani dictator Pervez Musharraf -- now living in self-exile in London -- to respond to the threat of Pakistan's nuclear weapons falling into the wrong hands.
Many foreign policy experts regard such proposals as head-scratchers, at best, and the Republican presidential candidates have been prone to occasional blunders and posturing, as well, when delving into international affairs -- that is, when they have had anything to say about the topic at all. It has often been an afterthought in the campaign -- in the CNN/Tea Party debate last month, it was the second-to-last question, before the one about whether the candidates would plant vegetable gardens or put in horseshoe pits at the White House. In an election in which the economy is the overriding focus, neither candidates nor voters bring it up much on the stump. 
Mitt Romney sought to change that on Friday when, during his first major foreign policy address before an audience of crisply clad, closely shorn cadets at The Citadel in Charleston, S.C., he called for restoring cuts to the military budget, spending more on missile defense and being tougher with Iran.
But he did not offer any specifics about troop levels in Afghanistan, saying he would conduct a review. And as much as anything, he used the opportunity to make a case that President Obama had surrendered American leadership around the world.
''If you do not want America to be the strongest nation on earth, I am not your president,'' Mr. Romney said. ''You have that president today.''
If they are united in their criticism of Mr. Obama, though, the Republican candidates differ on other issues, including the war in Afghanistan, and the primary campaign is to some degree a battle for control over the direction of foreign policy after a decade in which the party was defined by the hawkish stances of President George W. Bush and Senator John McCain, the 2008 Republican presidential nominee.
They have sought to capture the populist sentiment coursing through their party, as with Mr. Romney's call for a tough trade stance toward China. But they have hardly discussed how budget constraints at home might limit their ability to project American power or what specifically they would do to break the logjam on Middle East peace talks.
At a time when Mr. Obama can point to the killing of Osama bin Laden and other members of Al Qaeda's senior leadership, the Republican field is constrained in suggesting that Mr. Obama does not have the experience or fortitude to keep the nation safe. So the candidates are shifting to an argument that Mr. Obama has been too quick to apologize for the United States and unwilling to promote American exceptionalism.
''The message is that we unapologetically defend and promote America,'' said Richard Grenell, who was the spokesman for the American mission to the United Nations under Mr. Bush. ''We will not apologize for thinking America is exceptional; if you read Obama's Cairo speech, and see what the administration promotes at the United Nations, and look at how we sent the message that we're resetting our relations with Russia, it's an admission that we're apologizing for past policy.''
On Afghanistan, where 100,000 American troops remain, the candidates have been all over the map, but have yet to engage seriously with one another on their positions. Mr. Romney offered no specifics on Afghanistan during his speech on Friday, just saying he would ''order a full review of our transition to the Afghan military.''
Mr. Perry, perhaps the most opaque so far on foreign policy, said during the CNN/Tea Party debate that the United States should continue to have a ''presence'' in Afghanistan, but that it was time to start turning responsibility for the country over to the Afghans. Mr. Perry has not disclosed who is advising him on foreign affairs and has not given an address on the topic.
Jon M. Huntsman Jr., a former Utah governor, has called for winding down the war to focus on rebuilding at home, and Representative Ron Paul, representing a more isolationist strain of thinking, has called for a swift withdrawal.
But the substantive debate among them has been limited.
''This is unprecedented,'' said Leslie H. Gelb, president emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations. ''Beyond the standard Israel posturing, they don't say anything on the Middle East or the Arab Spring. And here the Afghan war is still an enormous open wound, an ongoing war, and you hear nothing of that.''
The economy's troubles have dominated the campaign so far and are likely to continue to do so as long as unemployment remains high. Still, history has also shown that national security has a way of moving to the fore and in many cases dominating presidencies.
Mr. Huntsman will be delivering his own foreign policy speech on Monday at Southern New Hampshire University. Mr. Huntsman, a former ambassador to China who speaks Mandarin Chinese, entered the race trying to elevate national security issues. But so far, he said Thursday in an interview, few people have been listening.
''I have been surprised'' at the low prominence of national security debate in the campaign so far, Mr. Huntsman said, ''especially given the times in which we are living.'' In an op-ed column for Politico on Friday, Mr. Huntsman took a punch at his competitors. ''Unlike my fellow candidates, my view of America's role in the world is shaped by hands-on experience gained during four stints overseas and serving in foreign policy positions for three presidents.''
On Friday, Mr. Romney outlined eight steps he would take in his first 100 days if elected president, including strengthening naval power by increasing shipbuilding, improving relationships with Israel, Britain and Mexico, and revisiting Bush-era missile defense system plans that were scrapped by Mr. Obama. He took a swipe at Mr. Obama for trying to build alliances with other countries on major issues.
''Know this: while America should work with other nations, we always reserve the right to act alone to protect our vital national interest,'' Mr. Romney said.
The day before his speech, Mr. Romney released the list of his foreign policy advisers -- a group freckled throughout with members of the Bush administration, including Michael Hayden, the former C.I.A. director, and Michael Chertoff, the former Homeland Security secretary.

HEADLINE: Checking Account Wars, Behind the Scenes

BYLINE: By RON LIEBER

 BODY:
This week, Senator Dick Durbin took to the Senate floor and called for a run on Bank of America.
The Illinois Democrat had pushed legislation, which went into effect a week ago, that limits the fees big banks collect from merchants, and he now finds himself the fall guy for Bank of America's new $5 monthly debit card fee. His response? He ranted and raved and suggested that consumers ''get the heck out of that bank.''
But even as Bank of America and other institutions are adding fees and other restrictions, a company called PerkStreet, which you may have read about in this column before, is hoping that those Bank of America customers will run to its Web site. PerkStreet gives checking account customers as much as 2 percent back on their purchases when they use its debit cards.
Meanwhile, a company called BancVue works with community banks and credit unions to offer checking accounts that can yield more than 3 percent in interest on deposits for people who use their debit cards a lot. Soon, the company asserts, the total number of branches among all of the institutions that offer its rewards checking accounts will equal that of the 10th-largest bank in America. 
So the big banks make you pay, and the most aggressive of the little institutions want to pay you. What on earth is going on here, and can this possibly continue?
First, let's be clear about what we talk about when we talk about free checking. As Ron Shevlin, an analyst at Aite Group, explains it, you can just as easily make a case that free checking will always exist as you can that it never existed in the first place.
''If I bring enough money and accounts, they are not going to charge me,'' he said. ''They would be crazy to.'' Indeed, that is still the case with Bank of America. If you have a mortgage with the bank or $20,000 on deposit, the $5 fee will not apply.
Even when nearly everyone had free checking several years ago, however, there were all sorts of questionable activities going on behind the scenes to pay for it. Overdraft fees were a big one. A.T.M. fees for using the wrong machine were also lucrative.
And then there are the merchants who have generally paid far more to the banks for the privilege of accepting their debit cards than the service actually costs. Those fees helped pay for free checking, but they probably contributed to slightly higher prices in the store.
The outrage over those merchant fees is what led Senator Durbin and his colleagues to limit what financial institutions with over $10 billion in assets can collect from merchants when customers use debit cards. Any checking account provider smaller than that, including PerkStreet and BancVue's partners, can continue collecting higher fees. Because they get more fees, it helps them offer better checking account terms.
Indeed, both companies are built in no small part on the backs of those merchants and the fees that they pay. PerkStreet offers a free checking account and 2 percent back on all debit card purchases (with no monthly or annual limits) to people who keep an average of $5,000 in a checking account. On days when you fall below that figure, you get 1 percent back, which is still a good deal for a debit card program.
Dan O'Malley, PerkStreet's co-founder, would not say what percentage of customers regularly earned 2 percent, though he said that the number was ''meaningful.'' I'd guess it's less than half. He achieves further savings by handing out the refunds only via gift cards, most of which he obtains at a discount to face value.
The catch for PerkStreet customers is that they have to sign for their purchases to get the rewards. (Recurring charges on the debit card from monthly billers earn rewards, too.) If customers punch in a PIN instead, PerkStreet usually gets less in fees from the merchants, so it generally doesn't give customers rewards when they do that.
Mr. O'Malley also would not say how many accounts the company had at the moment. As big banks have made changes in recent months, however, PerkStreet has tripled its account acquisition rate, he said. Last Friday, the day after Bank of America announced the $5 fee, the acquisition rate doubled again. On Saturday, it doubled yet again.
BancVue's checking accounts, which it encourages bank and credit union customers to call ''Kasasa,'' can offer high interest or rewards, depending on which platforms the partner institution wants to adopt.
The banks and credit unions decide how much interest to pay, and it can top 3 percent these days. The catch is that they generally limit how much money you can deposit to earn that rate, and you have to use your debit card at least 10 or 15 times a month.
Most don't require customers to sign for purchases, though. The theory here is that once you make people use the debit card 10 or 15 times a month, they'll put it at the top of their wallet and use it 20 or 30 times a month. So whether they sign or use a PIN, enough money rolls in from the merchants to pay for the high interest. (Some people may overdraw their accounts more often with heavy use, which also helps on the profitability front.)
In reality, according to Carolyn Jordan, a senior vice president at Neighborhood Credit Union, which has branches in and around Dallas, only half of people who sign up for its Kasasa accounts will make the required number of debit transactions in any given month. If they don't, they earn less, so that helps sustain the program.
Oddly enough, the Independent Community Bankers Association lobbied against the Durbin rule, even though it gave its members a pricing advantage. Bankers don't like it when the government sets rates, and the association doesn't believe a two-tier pricing system is sustainable.
Is the association right? We'll know only once the cat-and-mouse game that started with the new Durbin rule plays out.
Big banks could try to bully Visa and MasterCard into lowering the fees that small banks earn from debit cards. Noah Hanft, MasterCard's general counsel, says he doesn't worry about that happening. ''Sure, we have big customers, and they have different perspectives on what we should be doing,'' he said. ''But at the end of the day, we make those decisions independently, and I have no problem saying that in a very adamant way.''
Merchants may try to game the system, too, steering customers to use a PIN instead of signing if that remains cheaper. But card issuers choose their own networks, and if they see merchants trying to take advantage, they could potentially find networks that charge merchants more -- or ones that charge the same for PIN and signature.
David Evans, an economist who has done work for institutions that opposed the Durbin fee cap, sees another possibility. If big banks ratchet up the fees, that gives small banks cover to reduce their perks and raise their own fees some -- though not so much that they won't still be undercutting the big guys. That isn't great for consumers.
Mr. O'Malley sees a more self-serving possibility at work. The best way to make money as a small banker is to sell out to a big banker. But if the big banker earns less money after buying the small banker thanks to the debit fee cap, that means that small bankers can't sell for the same multiples as they used to.
''That's quite a conspiracy theory,'' said Viveca Ware, senior vice president for regulatory policy at the community bankers association.
And if the fees that the smaller institutions earn from debit transactions do fall? Ms. Jordan and other bank and credit union executives could just move all of their willing customers who qualify over to credit cards and get BancVue's help with rewarding them that way. After all, there are no limits on credit card merchant fees (at least not yet).
Mr. O'Malley, who has hired a gang of fellow former Capital One employees and student loan industry refugees, says they aren't interested in adding to people's debt with a credit card. My guess is that if his company were truly threatened by a big decline in debit fees, he'd offer a rewards card that customers would have to pay off each month.
If you're trying to figure out your own next move amid all of this uncertainty, well, good luck. As Adam Levitin, a Georgetown law professor, noted in a blog post on creditslips.org this week, it's hard to make apples to apples comparisons between one checking account and another, and harder still to move your money once you do decide to switch banks. This might be a good place for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to set standards.
So none of this is easy. Then again, if it were, there wouldn't be a national conversation going on now about checking accounts, of all things.

HEADLINE: Wall Street Protest Visits Washington Sq.

BYLINE: AL BAKER


HIGHLIGHT: A march north from Zuccotti Park under the watchful eye of the police. 

 BODY:
11:03 p.m. | Updated More than 1,000 Occupy Wall Street demonstrators streamed across the threshold of Washington Square Park on Saturday afternoon after a spirited but conflict-free march from the financial district.
As a throng of protesters filled the historic public space, at the heart of Greenwich Village, a chant rose up -- from voices young, old and in-between -- casting their movement as an intractable majority fed up with the nation's financial inequities.
"We are the 99 percent," they yelled, referring to the movement's slogan. Some banged drums. Others poked placards with various slogans toward blue skies on an unseasonably warm October weekend. Septuagenarians were in the crowd; one man walked a toddler on his feet. 
They arrived about 3:20 p.m., some 75 minutes after leaving the encampment they had established three weeks ago in Zuccotti Park, in Lower Manhattan. They zigzagged up Broadway, west on Barclay Street, north on Church Street, west on Franklin, north on West Broadway until LaGuardia Place, and along the way many spoke of the significance of the moment and of an effort seemingly gaining strength as it enters its fourth week.
In fact, at one point, as some police commanders tried to steer the procession along Sixth Avenue, the marchers disagreed and stayed on West Broadway, passing through the central corridor of SoHo and its bookstores, cafes and restaurants. The police did not resist.
"This Saturday is interesting because now there are two parks holding protests," said Max Fox, 23, an editor at The New Inquiry, an online magazine, who has attended Occupy Wall Street marches over the past two weeks. "It shows we can partially divide and still have significant presence in two parts of the city."
Added Marika Kandelaki, 31, an artist: "I like how it's expanding. It's a good move to take it to different parts of the city. Hopefully this is just the start and people will continue to meet and rethink public space. Make the public really public."
Despite the energy and optimism, no one missed the heavy contingent of police officers -- or forgot how a series of past police actions lent an air of tension to Saturday's march. Thick lines of officers flanked the main entrance of the park when the marchers entered. Rank-and-file officers, dressed in dark blue shirts, stood in pairs on the outer edges of the crowd. Others, in clusters of even more officers, guarded entrances and exits. Four commanders, in white shirts, were spotted on top of one of the columns at the northern end of the park, looking down on the crowd.
And on the blocks surrounding the park, police vans were parked all over with the countenances of police officers seated inside staring through the windows. Officers on horseback, too, were stationed around the park.
Many were aware that the park had a curfew that would arrive early Sunday morning. On Friday, Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said the number of officers present would be driven by the marchers' actions, which he said he could not predict.
"We, obviously, would like advance notice of what they are going to do," Mr. Kelly said. The park, he added, was a "regular park, a city park," and said it had a curfew that he believed began at midnight.
Asked what he predicted would occur when that moment arrived, Mr. Kelly said, "I don't have a crystal ball, but people will leave the park at the appropriate time, that is what I would anticipate happening."
In the end, tension between protesters and police officers did not materialize. During their march to Washington Square Park, protesters kept to the sidewalks and out of traffic in a purposeful attempt to prevent arrests. Once there, they held meetings until the early evening, when the crowd dispersed and protestors made their way back to Zuccotti Park, where they were welcomed with loud cheers.
On the Web site www.occupywallst.com, a schedule laid out both the intentions of the group to take to Washington Square Park for a "second general assembly," between 3 and 5 p.m., as well as other events in Zuccotti Park on Saturday evening.
And despite speculation on Friday that Zuccotti Park might be abandoned by the protesters, it remained a vibrant encampment, with activity spilling onto the sidewalk and along Broadway and Liberty Street.
Just after 3 p.m., Justin Sane, of the band Anti-Flag, which is known for anti-corporate sentiments, stood near a tall metal sculpture at the southeast corner of Zuccotti Park and played a few songs on an acoustic guitar, including "This is the End," from the band's album "For Blood and Empire" and "Should I Stay or Should I Go," by the Clash.
As the crowd sang along, he thanked them, saying, "You guys have beautiful voices; you sound like a choir of angels."
Caren H. Dashow, a notary public, said she had come to take testimonials from people about their notions of an ideal world -- and create legal documents by notarizing them.
"It's not about what we don't want," Ms. Dashow, 39, said of the movement. "It's about what we want."
Running her stand, marked by a yellow balloon, from 3 to 5 p.m. each day since Thursday, Ms. Dashow, 39, said she had collected 41 petitions.
One of those who had her thoughts notarized was Puja Gupta, 28, who put no limits on the demonstrators' ambitions for betterment. "I do hereby declare that I am a whole and complete human being," she wrote on a official-looking form.
Other manifestos capturing people's visions for the future ran the gamut. They included: "All beings shall reach enlightenment"; "Health and education is a right for all citizens"; and a vision of having "cars running on potatoes."
Larry Martin, a professor of social sciences at Medgar Evers College in Brooklyn, was there with five students from a black college fraternity at the State University at Binghamton. He said the movement was gaining in diversity.
"We are coming because this is the spark of an economic abolitionist movement," said Mr. Martin, equating this struggle to the country's antislavery movement.
One of the Binghamton students, Anthony Steward, 20, a junior, said of the Occupy Wall Street effort: "It's not going to go away. It's a small representation of a long-term project."
Smack amid the throngs of people, Eve Silber, who said she was part of Occupy Wall Street's community affairs committee, stood with a stack of fliers in her arms and passed them out with vigor. The words on them encouraged prudence: Stay sober; respect people and property; keep the park clean.
"We're here to present ourselves as those who could be accountable and seen as people who can make this world better," said Ms. Silber, a jazz artist and music teacher.

HEADLINE: Romney Tries to Reassure Socially Conservative Audience

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER


HIGHLIGHT: The candidate promised to support the Defense of Marriage Act, and to appoint Supreme Court justices who would help overturn Roe v. Wade. 

 BODY:
WASHINGTON, D.C. - Though Mitt Romney has stuck to a relentless focus on jobs and the economy while on the campaign trail, he departed from his usual message Saturday morning at the Values Voter Summit, devoting part of his speech to the socially conservative issues the crowd had come to hear about.
"Wow, a lot of old friends here; good to be so enthusiastically welcomed," Mr. Romney said, taking the stage before an audience made up of the sort of voters who have not always enthusiastically welcomed him, distrustful of his status as a true social conservative. 
Mr. Romney began by talking about the economy, and at The Citadel, referring to the "American Century" he envisions if elected president.
"As president of the United States, I will devote myself to an American century, and I will never, ever apologize for America," he said. "It's very simple. If you do not want America to be the strongest nation on earth, I am not your president."
But Mr. Romney also took the opportunity to talk about some of his positions on social issues.
"Now, the foundation needed for a strong economy and a strong military is a people of strong values," Mr. Romney said, recalling that he was blessed to be raised by happily married parents whose example "led me to marry and have children, and now to bask in the joy of 16 grandchildren."
He promised to support the Defense of Marriage Act and to appoint Supreme Court justices who would help overturn Roe v. Wade. 
"We know that marriage is more than a personally rewarding social custom - it's also critical for the well-being of a civilization," Mr. Romney said. "That's why it's so important to preserve traditional marriage, the joining together of one man and one woman."
On abortion, he said, "Our values must encompass the life of an unborn child."
"The law may call it a right, but no one ever called it a good, and in the quiet of conscience, people of both political parties know that more than a million abortions a year can't be squared with the good heart of America," he said. "And I will nominate judges who know the difference between personal opinion and law. It is long past time for the Supreme Court to return the issue of abortion back to the states by overturning Roe v. Wade."
Mr. Romney also used his speech to distance himself from Bryan Fischer, who spoke after him and is known for his harsh comments on homosexuality, gay rights, Muslims and Mormons. 
Without directly naming Mr. Fischer, Mr. Romney reminded the audience, "Decency and civility are values, too."
"One of the speakers to follow me today has crossed that line, I think," he said. "Poisonous language doesn't advance our cause; it's never softened a single heart or changed a single mind. Blessings of faith carry the responsibility of civil and respectful debate."
He concluded: "The task before us is to focus on the conservative beliefs and the values that unite us. Let no agenda narrow our vision or drive us apart. We have important work to accomplish."

HEADLINE: Perry, in Iowa, Focuses on Immigration

BYLINE: JEFF ZELENY


HIGHLIGHT: The Texas governor also announced that he would offer a detailed plan for job creation next week in the first policy speech of his presidential candidacy. 

 BODY:
ORANGE CITY, Iowa - Gov. Rick Perry of Texas said Saturday that he would offer a detailed plan for job creation next week in the first policy speech of his presidential candidacy. But during a weekend visit here, he spent much of the time focusing on another issue: immigration.
 In three stops across northwestern Iowa, the state's most conservative region, Mr. Perry delivered a forceful recitation of the steps he had taken in Texas to enforce immigration laws. He reminded audiences that he vetoed legislation granting driver's licenses to illegal immigrants and he signed a law requiring voters to show identification.
"Legal votes should not be canceled out by illegal ones," Mr. Perry said.
Yet at every event, voters did little to mask their skepticism. They pointedly asked him to explain the Texas law that allows illegal immigrants to qualify for in-state tuition rates at public colleges and universities.
He neither repeated nor recanted a remark he made last month when he suggested Republicans were heartless for opposing the idea. But he sought to allay their concerns about a topic that has threatened to overshadow his economic message.
"They dumped it on the states," Mr. Perry said. "Are we going to kick these people to the side of the road and let them become tax wasters? Or are we going to give them the opportunity to go to an institution of higher learning, pay full in-state tuition, which we do, and require them pursue citizenship? The issue was really driven by economics."
He did not raise the in-state tuition issue on his own. But when he was asked about it, he sought to explain it in a measured way and frame it as an economic argument. His irritation was clear, though, when he encountered a face-to-face question after his speech from a woman who demanded to know why illegal immigrants were given preferential treatment.
The woman, Fae Groff-Moritz, a 63-year-old medical records clerk, approached Mr. Perry and asked why one of her children had to pay out-of-state tuition in neighboring South Dakota when illegal immigrants in Texas receive in-state tuition.
"It sounds like a pretty free ride," she said.
"It's not," he replied. "I don't know where you're hearing it. It's not a free ride."
Mr. Perry acknowledged that he has struggled to explain the issue, saying, "Sometimes in a one-minute sound bite, it's hard to get all of that in, but the key is this: because of the failure of the federal government to deal with the border, we have to deal with it."
He added: "If other states don't want to do that, that's their call, I respect that. It's not a federal issue. As the president of the United States, I wouldn't allow it to be a federal issue."
The issue has been stoked here in Iowa, whose caucuses will open the 2012 nominating contest, by his leading Republican rival, Mitt Romney. On the eve of Mr. Perry's arrival, the Romney campaign released a flier saying that the in-state tuition benefit amounted to a break of $70,000 a student. 
Mr. Perry rejected that argument again and again as he addressed enthusiastic crowds in Sioux City, Orange City and Spencer. Several voters said in interviews that his position was not necessarily a deal-breaker and that they were pleased by fuller explanation.
"Texas is a country of its own," said Kathryn Parsons, 88, who rose from her seat to ask one of the most pointed questions of the day on the topic. "He's under the gun down there."
While she said she disagreed with him, she added: "He probably would be our very best candidate - right now."
On his fourth visit to Iowa as a presidential candidate, Mr. Perry did not take questions from reporters. His aides and Texas Rangers often formed a semicircle around him as he shook hands and signed autographs at the end of an event.
Mr. Perry smiled but declined to answer a question from a reporter here, then approached a group of three women. A few moments later, though, he was back to immigration, when Mrs. Groff-Moritz grabbed his arm, looked him in the eye and said she had a question about the in-state tuition.
 "Yes ma'am," he said.

HEADLINE: After a Year in Economic Overdrive, Brazil Hopes to Elude Pitfalls

BYLINE: By ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO

 BODY:
SAO PAULO, Brazil -- In the first major test of her stewardship of Latin America's largest economy, President Dilma Rousseff is struggling to break free of an economic trap.
Coming off a year in which it recorded its highest growth in a quarter century, Brazil is faced with rising inflation, an overvalued currency and an industrial sector losing competitiveness to cheap Chinese imports.
But Ms. Rousseff's promising efforts to fix those problems could be undermined in the coming months as the government embarks on one of its biggest spending sprees in decades.
The leaders of the United States and Europe, struggling to right their listing economies, would count themselves lucky to have problems like Brazil's. Its economy -- driven by soaring prices for commodities, robust Chinese demand for raw materials and a domestic consumption boom spurred on by expanding credit -- grew 7.5 percent last year, its highest rate since 1986. 
''Like other emerging countries, Brazil has thus far been less affected by the global crisis,'' Ms. Rousseff, an economist, said at the United Nations last month. ''But we know that our capacity to resist is not unlimited.''
Her strategy so far has been bold. Predicting that the global economy will not improve this year, Brazil's Central Bank has slashed interest rates, making a risky bet that already high inflation would not soar further. That move, aimed at encouraging growth and reducing the value of the currency, was paired with measures to protect Brazil's industries from a flood of Asian imports.
That approach has shown early signs of success. The stubbornly high Brazilian real began losing value to the dollar last month, reaching its lowest point since 2008 two weeks ago before recovering somewhat last week.
The shift has been front-page news in Brazil, dampening a buoyancy among Brazilians who felt richer than ever. Even as the overvalued currency slowed industrial production, it fueled consumer spending at home and abroad at a blistering pace.
The average per capita purchases by Brazilians in the United States grew 250 percent between 2003 and 2010. Only the Japanese and the British spend more in the United States than Brazilians, figures from the United States Commerce Department show. The foreign spending, which diverts money that could support Brazilian industry, has alarmed government officials here, who have tried to slow the pace of consumption by imposing restrictions on credit card purchases.
But government spending represents the bigger threat.
Next year, the government will be obligated to meet tens of billions of dollars in promised payments for social welfare programs, minimum wage increases and infrastructure projects for its twin billing on the global stage, the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
A 14.7 percent increase in the minimum wage is scheduled to take effect in 2012 at a cost of $13 billion, new low-income housing subsidies will cost $6 billion, and investments for the sporting events are expected to cost at least $4.5 billion, said Luiz Schymura, director of the Brazilian Economic Institute at the Getulio Vargas Foundation in Rio de Janeiro.
Since her inauguration in January, Ms. Rousseff has shown a willingness to take a red pen to fiscal spending. Her government approved $28 billion in budget cuts, privatized airports -- a move considered long overdue by economists and many policy makers -- and stood up to unions demanding even higher wage increases.
But standing up to the minimum wage or the World Cup may be politically impossible.
''For all her good intentions, the political pressures on her will be enormous,'' Dr. Schymura said.
The surge in spending, accompanied by lower interest rates, could produce a cycle of higher inflation, economists fear. Whether the new policies will be enough to revitalize Brazil's industrial sector remains to be seen. The economy's growth has slowed this year to about 3.5 percent, economists say, about half that of last year. And the consumption boom is slowing. Housing, grocery and retail stores are all reporting reduced sales, said Alfredo Coutino, director for Latin America at Moody's Analytics.
''Now everybody is questioning if the consumption boom was sustainable or not, because everybody is losing now,'' he said. ''The future in Brazil is not certain, or at least not as certain as believed at the beginning of the year.''
There are also concerns that structural shifts are under way that will continue to stymie growth. Industry's share of total economic production has been slipping, to 15.4 percent last year from 19.2 percent in 2004, government figures show.
''Some people say that Brazil is immersed in a de-industrialization process,'' Dr. Coutino said.
The government has moved aggressively to protect industry, saying last month that it would raise import taxes on foreign cars and trucks by 30 percentage points to protect jobs in Brazil's flagging auto industry.
Brazilian industry pins its decline on the overvalued real, which reduced demand for Brazilian products, and for that Finance Minister Guido Mantega blames the United States and China for exacerbating a ''currency war.''
But the real has also strengthened because of high interest rates, which have attracted a heavy influx of dollars from overseas investors. Brazil's benchmark interest rate of 12 percent -- which was slashed in August from 12.5 percent -- remains among the highest in the world.
The government is determined not to repeat past mistakes. After the September 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers, Brazil waited four months to begin cutting interest rates. The surprise cut in August came as inflation climbed to a six-year high, and more cuts could be coming.
''As the financial crisis worsens, this time we will take advantage of it,'' Ms. Rousseff said to business leaders here last month.
Despite the moves, analysts fear that Ms. Rousseff will pay a political price for Brazil's economic dip.
When former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva was re-elected to a second term in 2006, Brazil's economy was taking off. His government's approval ratings steadily soared, topping 80 percent in some polls as he left office on Jan. 1.
Ms. Rousseff, his chosen successor, was elected last October just as Brazil's economy was starting to overheat, with another global slowdown months away. But so far she has not mustered the same political support that Mr. da Silva enjoyed, and she has struggled to contain unrest in her governing coalition. Five ministers have resigned in the past four months, the latest being Pedro Novais, the tourism minister, who stepped down last month amid allegations of ethics violations.
Ms. Rousseff ''is embarking upon a politically more difficult path precisely when her base of support in Congress could start to wane and her approval ratings are more likely to drop over the next four to six months,'' said Christopher Garman, an analyst at Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy in New York.
''She is embarking upon a bold strategy,'' he said, ''but she won't be able to fully deliver on that strategy.''

HEADLINE: That Felon Inspecting Trash? He Used to Be Mayor

BYLINE: By EVAN SERPICK

 BODY:
My encounter with Gerry McCann began with a warrant for my arrest.
In August, my wife and I sold our house in Jersey City. About a month later, I got a call from the new owner, who had received some ''important-looking'' mail addressed to me. I asked her to open it. She did, and gasped -- not a good sign.
''NOTICE OF WARRANT FOR ARREST ISSUED,'' it read at the top. It did not explain why the warrant was issued, but it did suggest that I report to the police in order to post bail, which was listed at $1,000.
I didn't recall committing any crimes, so I called the municipal courthouse. I discovered that the warrant was issued after a ticket from the Jersey City Incinerator Authority had gone unpaid. Apparently, my tenants had left some garbage out a day early when they moved out in August. A $106 ticket was mailed out but never received. When a month had passed without payment, the warrant was issued. 
After pleading my case several times and being forwarded to various municipal offices, I was told I had to speak to the inspector who issued the ticket, Gerry McCann, and was given his cellphone number. After I explained my case, Mr. McCann was surprisingly sympathetic.
''I'm going to see the judge later -- I'll get her to dismiss the warrant,'' he said. ''Just make sure you send her a check for the fine, and make sure you mention my name.''
I hung up, relieved. But something about Mr. McCann struck me as strange. He was nothing like the countless bureaucratic functionaries I'd dealt with over the years. He was confident, reasonable -- and able to actually solve a problem on the spot. Also, his name apparently carried some weight, and he seemed to have an oddly close connection to Chief Judge Nesle A. Rodriguez.
On a lark, I Googled him. All the links referred to Gerald McCann, a twice-elected former mayor of Jersey City. ''Well, that ain't him,'' I thought. Then I noticed that Mayor McCann had been removed from office in 1992, after being convicted of a savings-and-loan scam, and spent two years in federal prison. I wondered if it could be the same man. Then I came across a topic from February 2010 on a local political Internet forum: ''City Hires Former Mayor and Felon, Gerry McCann.''
''Yeah, that's me,'' Mr. McCann said when I called him back. (This time I smiled at his ring-back tone: Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers' ''I Won't Back Down.'') For those familiar with Jersey City politics, the irony of the former mayor's employment with the incinerator authority is especially thick.
Mr. McCann's trial, which related to investments made in the four years between his two terms in office, proved to be particularly contentious. Michael Chertoff, who went on to become Secretary of Homeland Security under President George W. Bush, was the prosecutor. Mr. McCann, who vehemently denied wrongdoing -- and still does -- assailed Mr. Chertoff.
''They were insane to bring this case in the first place,'' he announced at one news conference. ''And we are going to send Mr. Chertoff back to preparing wills. Maybe I can find him a job driving a sanitation truck in Jersey City.''
Mr. McCann, tucked into a booth in the VIP Diner in Jersey City, allowed a small smirk after being reminded of the comment. ''It just so happened that this is the job I like doing,'' he said. ''Chertoff handled Katrina, so you get an idea of how competent he is.''
At 61, Mr. McCann still has the glad hands of a politician. Within 10 minutes of sitting down, he had been recognized and greeted by former Councilman Ben Lopez, who sang the former mayor's praises -- ''Without him, a lot of that development downtown would never have happened,'' he said -- and a local building manager who has been ticketed by Mr. McCann several times. He was less enthusiastic, but still friendly.
Mr. McCann was 31 when he was elected mayor in 1981 -- the second youngest in the city's history. He takes credit for promoting waterfront redevelopment, helping spur an economic boom and attracting young professionals from New York. As a Democrat, he was an early and vocal supporter of Ronald Reagan -- who kicked off his 1980 campaign in Jersey City -- which helped lure federal money to the city. Mr. McCann lost a bid for re-election in 1985, but he won back the office in 1989 and served until his 1991 conviction.
The trial revolved around Mr. McCann's 1986 partnership with a Florida savings and loan association to develop a marina in Liberty State Park. The S.&L. sent Mr. McCann $300,000 to develop a proposal for the project, but the government contended that the former mayor spent the money on a leased Mercedes-Benz, rare coins and other luxuries, and failed to deliver a proposal. Mr. McCann maintains that he did nothing improper and earned less than $60,000 for his work on the project over two years.
''If you go against the federal government, you're going to lose -- it's almost impossible,'' he said, explaining the conviction. ''The government wins, like, 98 percent of the time.'' Mr. McCann, an accountant by trade, served his two-year sentence in the low-security Allenwood federal prison in Pennsylvania, where he did the payroll and cost accounting. ''It was one of the funniest times of my life,'' he said. ''I had my own car there.''
After getting out, Mr. McCann wanted to return to politics in Jersey City and tried unsuccessfully to challenge the prohibition against felons running for office. Nonetheless, he has remained in the political mix, and not without contention.
He served as an adviser to various campaigns over the years and won election to the Board of Education in 2007, though he was also sued by one of his opponents in the race who claimed that Mr. McCann had improperly signed up voters in a nursing home; the case was eventually dropped. Later, it was suggested that Mr. McCann had leaked pictures of Jerramiah T. Healy, one of the candidates in a 2004 special election for mayor, naked and drunk on the porch of his house. Mr. McCann denies it. (Mr. Healy won and remains Jersey City's mayor.)
He first worked for the incinerator authority as an inspector 10 years ago, but he was fired in 2004 (as payback for supposedly leaking the photos, he claims, though the authority's chief executive, Oren Dabney, said it was over policies and procedures).
He started at the job again last January, earning $50,000 a year, as an environmental services monitor, a non-uniformed inspector who follows up on complaints about illegal dumping and other compliance issues throughout the city. But he still does not see eye-to-eye with his superiors. ''He's overly aggressive at times,'' said Mr. Dabney, who recently suspended Mr. McCann for failing to give people warning before issuing tickets (hello!). ''We want to educate people, give them the benefit of the doubt, but Gerry has a strong work ethic -- a little too strong maybe.''
Mr. McCann dismissed Mr. Dabney's concerns, as he does others who have criticized him. ''Whatever I do, I give it 100 percent,'' he said. ''They ask me to give out tickets, I'll give out tickets all day. I'll go sit on sites at 2 in the morning.''
Walking around Jersey City with Mr. McCann makes it clear that he is not a disgraced man. There are the occasional shouts of ''Hey Mayor!'' and Mr. McCann's running commentary includes a tour of buildings that were developed during his administration, along with properties he has recently ticketed.
There is also the endless reserve of Jersey City trivia: ''Jackie Robinson played his first major league game here''; ''The original Ozzie and Harriet lived in that building right there''; ''The Stanley Theater was once the second-biggest in America, behind Radio City.'' He brags about growing up with Robert Bell from Kool and the Gang, suing New York for control of the Statue of Liberty, and meeting Richard Nixon, who told him, ''I read about you in The Bergen Record!''
''Frank Sinatra hated Hoboken,'' Mr. McCann declares at one point, citing Jersey City's next-door rival, the birthplace of Ol' Blue Eyes. ''He moved to Jersey City and lived here for nine years -- he married a Jersey City girl, and his first two kids were born here!''
He could have gone on all day, but Mr. McCann had to get to track practice -- he coaches the St. Peter's Prep team -- at 3:30.
''People ask me all the time if I have any regrets and I tell them no,'' he said. ''I have three daughters and four grandchildren that I love. I get to coach track, which I love, every day. I don't need money 'cause I don't have bad habits.
''I've had a successful life,'' he said. ''I had a lot that I had to deal with, but it's not my whole life.''

HEADLINE: Oakland Schools Expanding Free-Meal Programs

BYLINE: By KATHARINE MIESZKOWSKI; Sydney Lupkin contributed reporting.. 
kmieszkowski@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
On a recent Saturday morning, some 60 teachers and nurses from the Oakland Unified School District gathered at Tilden Education Complex for a daylong seminar on nutrition education.
Markell Lewis, a nutrition policy advocate for California Food Policy Advocates, a nonprofit group based in Oakland, stood at the front of the room. ''How many of you have ever given food to a hungry student at school?'' she asked the teachers and nurses, as they ate breakfast. Almost everyone raised a hand.
Recent figures from the United States Census Bureau revealed that Alameda County has a higher percentage of residents living in poverty than any of the other eight counties in the Bay Area. The county has high unemployment and low family incomes, and nearly 70 percent of students in the Oakland school district now qualify for free or reduced-priced meals at school. 
In the last year, Oakland schools have introduced and expanded a host of programs, some federally subsidized, to feed students at school and home. Dozens of parents now line up outside schools, at the end of school days, to receive plastic bags of food provided by a food bank.
''Kids are coming to school hungrier and hungrier,'' said Allison Rodman, a mother of two students, who is involved in the Oakland School Food Alliance, a group working to improve school food.
Rodolfo Perez, outreach coordinator for Greenleaf Elementary School in East Oakland, said: ''Hungry kids cannot learn,'' adding, ''There are a lot of parents that are out of work right now.''
According to the Census Bureau, some 200,000 people in Alameda County, representing 13.5 percent of the population, live below the poverty line. The figure was 10.7 percent a year earlier.
Demand for free food is increasing in the county. In September, the Alameda County Community Food Bank received 3,770 calls to its emergency food helpline -- the highest volume of calls to date. The second-highest volume of calls was in August.
Robyn Sakamoto, a dietitian with the Alameda County Public Health Department, said that making sure students eat breakfast helped them learn better. ''You are going to get more quality instructional time having a child with a full stomach,'' she said.
Today, more than 90 Oakland schools offer a free breakfast to all students. At some schools, students are allowed to eat breakfast once class has started, which removes the hurdle of showing up early to get a free meal in the cafeteria.
When students eat together in class, officials say, the social stigma is removed from the neediest students, who otherwise might eat alone.
At Melrose Leadership Academy in East Oakland, every day, the school serves about 200 free breakfasts to its 285 students.
After Melinda Ayadi gave a lesson about the alphabet recently, each of the 25 desks in her classroom held a serving of cereal, graham crackers, milk and a nectarine.
Parent volunteers had set up the breakfast, which was provided by the school cafeteria. By 9 a.m., the kindergartners were spooning Froot Loops. Several of them also ate the nectarines.
Some Melrose teachers were not thrilled with having to sacrifice lesson time to eating.
''It is kind of an interruption,'' Ms. Ayadi said. ''I would rather they had breakfast at home and use the school time for academics. But I realize that there are kids that if they don't get breakfast at school won't eat. If kids don't eat breakfast, they won't do well academically.''
Nutrition advocates and the parent group, the Oakland School Food Alliance, are pressing more Oakland schools to offer breakfast in classrooms.
The district has taken a different approach to making breakfast accessible -- and appealing -- to teenagers. At Fremont Federation of High Schools in Oakland, two courtyard food carts offer a ''Grab 'n' Go'' breakfast. Students can pick up a bagged breakfast, including things like an orange and blueberry bread with a choice of milk or apple juice.
M'kala Payton, 16, explained why she was getting her breakfast on the run. She had not eaten dinner the night before or breakfast that morning, she said, and ''I woke up late.''
Another student who picked up his bagged breakfast said he welcomed the meal, even though he had already eaten that morning -- a Snickers bar.
The offer of healthy food does not end when class does.
''I know the majority of our students, when they leave school, they're not eating, and if they are eating, quite frankly, it's bad food,'' said Jennifer LeBarre, director of nutrition services for the district.
At least nine after-school programs at Oakland schools will be offering dinner to students starting this month.
More than 20 Oakland schools, in neighborhoods where fresh fruits and vegetables are scarce, host food stands that sell fresh produce to students and parents.
At schools in the poorest areas, Alameda County Community Food Bank distributes food to families at the end of every other week. The initiative, called the Children's BackPack Program, is designed to keep children fed through the weekend.
''This makes sure that these children are getting the same level of nutrition over the weekend that they are getting at school,'' said Michael Altfest, a spokesman for the food bank.
As dozens of parents, mostly mothers, waited outside Greenleaf Elementary School in East Oakland to receive plastic bags of food provided by the food bank, the mother of a 5-year-old pupil, who would not give her name because she and her son had recently fled domestic violence, said it was good to have ''special things just for him'' to eat.
The bags contained tuna, peas, rice, oatmeal, milk and fresh apples, and 100 of them went quickly.
''It's helpful,'' the mother said of the food program. ''Anything is helpful nowadays.''

HEADLINE: Inflating the Software Report Card

BYLINE: By TRIP GABRIEL and MATT RICHTEL

 BODY:
The Web site of Carnegie Learning, a company started by scientists at Carnegie Mellon University that sells classroom software, trumpets this promise: ''Revolutionary Math Curricula. Revolutionary Results.''
The pitch has sounded seductive to thousands of schools across the country for more than a decade. But a review by the United States Department of Education last year would suggest a much less alluring come-on: Undistinguished math curricula. Unproven results.
The federal review of Carnegie Learning's flagship software, Cognitive Tutor, said the program had ''no discernible effects'' on the standardized test scores of high school students. A separate 2009 federal look at 10 major software products for teaching algebra as well as elementary and middle school math and reading found that nine of them, including Cognitive Tutor, ''did not have statistically significant effects on test scores.''
Amid a classroom-based software boom estimated at $2.2 billion a year, debate continues to rage over the effectiveness of technology on learning and how best to measure it. But it is hard to tell that from technology companies' promotional materials. 
Many companies ignore well-regarded independent studies that test their products' effectiveness. Carnegie's Web site, for example, makes no mention of the 2010 review, by the Education Department's What Works Clearinghouse, which analyzed 24 studies of Cognitive Tutor's effectiveness but found that only four of those met high research standards. Some firms misrepresent research by cherry-picking results and promote surveys or limited case studies that lack the scientific rigor required by the clearinghouse and other authorities.
''The advertising from the companies is tremendous oversell compared to what they can actually demonstrate,'' said Grover J. Whitehurst, a former director of the Institute of Education Sciences, the federal agency that includes What Works.
School officials, confronted with a morass of complicated and sometimes conflicting research, often buy products based on personal impressions, marketing hype or faith in technology for its own sake.
''They want the shiny new one,'' said Peter Cohen, chief executive of Pearson School, a leading publisher of classroom texts and software. ''They always want the latest, when other things have been proven the longest and demonstrated to get results.''
Carnegie, one of the most respected of the educational software firms, is hardly alone in overpromising or misleading. The Web site of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt says that ''based on scientific research, Destination Reading is a powerful early literacy and adolescent literacy program,'' but it fails to mention that it was one of the products the Department of Education found in 2009 not to have statistically significant effects on test scores.
Similarly, Pearson's Web site cites several studies of its own to support its claim that Waterford Early Learning improves literacy, without acknowledging the same 2009 study's conclusion that it had little impact.
And Intel, in a Web document urging schools to buy computers for every student, acknowledges that ''there are no longitudinal, randomized trials linking eLearning to positive learning outcomes.'' Yet it nonetheless argues that research shows that technology can lead to more engaged and economically successful students, happier teachers and more involved parents.
''To compare this public relations analysis to a carefully constructed research study is laughable,'' said Alex Molnar, professor of education at the National Education Policy Center at the University of Colorado. ''They are selling their wares.''
Carnegie officials say 600,000 students in 44 states use its products, many taking teacher-led classes three times a week with Carnegie-provided workbooks and spending the other two class periods in computer labs using Cognitive Tutor. The full curriculum can cost nearly three times as much as a typical textbook over six years.
Officials declined to release annual revenue figures, but Carnegie Learning was acquired in August for $75 million by the parent of the for-profit University of Phoenix. Carnegie Mellon University, which had retained ownership of the Cognitive Tutor software and licensed it to Carnegie Learning, earned an additional $21.5 million from the sale.
Steve Ritter, a founder and the chief scientist of Carnegie Learning, said there were flaws in the What Works Clearinghouse evaluations of Cognitive Tutor and disputed the Education Department's judgment of what makes a worthy study.
''What you want to focus on is more of the why,'' he said, ''and less of a horse race to find out what works and doesn't.''
A Carnegie spokeswoman, Mary Murrin, said in a statement that the company used ''the data from all studies with varying outcomes to continuously improve our programs.''
Karen Billings, a vice president of the Software and Information Industry Association -- a trade group representing many education companies -- said the problem was not that companies overpromise, but that schools often do not properly deploy the products or train teachers to use them. Ms. Billings's group helped design the field trials, in 132 schools, for the landmark 2009 government study of 10 software products, which was ordered by Congress and cost $15 million.
Then came the deflating results. The industry ''became very hostile,'' recalled Mr. Whitehurst, now director of education policy at the Brookings Institution. ''It seems to me,'' he added, '' 'hypocrisy' is the right word for loving something until the results are not what you expect.''
The Hard Sell
Shelly Allen, the math coordinator for public schools in Augusta, Ga., has seen a lot of curriculum salespeople pass through. She is wary of their sweet words and hard sell.
In June, when representatives from Carnegie Learning visited, Dr. Allen warned: ''I just want everybody to know I grew up here. I graduated from here. My children go to school here. When you guys get back where you live, our kids have to still be able to reach goals we set.''
Augusta is famous for its magnolia-shaded National Golf Club, host to the Masters Tournament, but its public schools are typical of struggling urban districts. Three-quarters of the 32,000 students in the district, Richmond County, are black, and 72 percent are poor enough to qualify for the federal lunch program. The mean SAT math score last year was 443, below Georgia's mean of 490 and the nation's 516.
Six years ago, the district adopted Cognitive Tutor for about 3,000 students at risk of failing, paying $101,500 annually to use it. As students work through problems, the computer analyzes their weaknesses and serves up new items until they grasp the skill and are allowed to move on. To a student, the promotional materials say, it feels ''as if the software is getting to know her and supporting her like a tutor.''
So when the screen says: ''You are saving to buy a bicycle. You have $10, and each day you are able to save $2,'' the student must convert the word problem into an algebraic expression. If he is stumped, he can click on the ''Hint'' button.
''Define a variable for the time from now,'' the software advises. Still stumped? Click ''Next Hint.''
''Use x to represent the time from now.'' Aha. The student types ''2x+10.''
The software likes this and moves on to highlight a series of questions in green, beginning with, ''How many more days must you save to buy a bike that costs $60?'' Using his 2x+10 formula, the student enters ''25.''
After solving several questions of this sort and plotting them on a graph, the student would click ''Skillometer'' to see how he had fared. A series of forest-green bars would show that he did well labeling axes for his graph, but not so well writing the initial formula.
Moving on, Cognitive Tutor would bump him down to an easier problem: ''A skier noticed that he can complete a run in about 30 minutes (half an hour).'' The expression relating ski runs to time would be 2x, with x representing hours.
''Immediate feedback,'' Carnegie Learning explains on its Web site, ''enables the student to self-correct and leads to more effective learning.''
Augusta officials liked the program enough that when concerns arose last winter that many 11th graders were not on track to pass a new state graduation test, the district asked to expand the software's use to all 9,400 of its high school students. The company agreed to provide access for no additional charge -- temporarily.
''As a company, it makes sense to give you the opportunity to prove it works for all students,'' Anita Sprayberry, a regional sales manager, told school leaders. That way, she said, ''We can talk about a bigger sale.''
Going forward, Ms. Sprayberry said, the cost would be about $34,000 for each of the district's 11 high schools.
In a recent interview, Dr. Allen said she was familiar with the What Works Clearinghouse, but not its 2010 finding that Cognitive Tutor did not raise test scores more than textbooks.
Though the clearinghouse is intended to help school leaders choose proven curriculum, a 2010 Government Accountability Office survey of district officials found that 58 percent of them had never heard of What Works, never mind consulted its reviews.
''Decisions are made on marketing, on politics, on personal preference,'' said Robert A. Slavin, director of the Center for Research and Reform in Education at Johns Hopkins University. ''An intelligent, caring principal who'd never buy a car without looking at Consumer Reports, when they plunk down serious money to buy a curriculum, they don't even look at the evidence.''
Evaluating Curriculums
Founded in 1998 by cognitive and computer scientists along with math teachers, Carnegie Learning is proud of its academic heritage, and many education researchers consider it a model of rigor and transparency.
One founder, John R. Anderson, received the 2011 Benjamin Franklin Medal in Computer and Cognitive Science for work on how humans perceive, learn and reason. The company's Web site promises that its curriculums ''provide the research-based foundation for proven results,'' citing ''success stories'' from around the country.
At Dundalk Middle School in Baltimore County, Md., for example, Carnegie Learning says that Cognitive Tutor led to an increase in the passing rate on a state assessment, to 86 percent in 2004 from 49 percent in 2002. What it does not say is that the rate remained at 85 percent last year, even though Dundalk dropped Cognitive Tutor in 2007 because of difficulties arranging lab time.
That is why many academics dismiss case studies: it is too easy for slices of data to be taken out of context, or for correlation to be confused with causation.
Instead, the gold standard of education research is a field trial in which similar groups of students are randomly assigned to classes where one uses the curriculum and the other does not.
The Carnegie Web site lists five such trials and says they all show positive results for Cognitive Tutor.
Three of these studies, however, were rejected by the What Works Clearinghouse for flaws in their design; in a fourth, the clearinghouse identified a problem with part of the study -- the part that purported to show benefits. One of the rejected studies had found that users of Cognitive Tutor in 10 Miami high schools scored better on Florida state exams than a control group, but the clearinghouse found that the students being compared were not equivalent.
''The entire 'effect' of Cognitive Tutor possibly can be traced to other factors,'' said Mark Dynarski, a former director of the clearinghouse, ''and the way in which the research was carried out does not allow one to know if this is the case.''
Dr. Ritter, Carnegie's chief scientist, noted that the clearinghouse's 2010 review was limited to high schools and that a year earlier it found that Cognitive Tutor had ''potentially positive effects'' in middle school.
The middle school finding rested on one study, out of 14 reviewed. That study is featured prominently on the Carnegie Web site, which omits mention of two others that the Education Department judged to be well designed but showed no benefits.
Dr. Ritter said he had excluded those studies, in Hawaii and Virginia, because the students had not used Cognitive Tutor precisely as the company intended. The researcher who did the Hawaii study, Denis Newman, said it reflected how Cognitive Tutor was used in the real world.
Dr. Newman is also the author of research guidelines for the Software and Information Industry Association, where Dr. Ritter sits on the education research working group. One of those guidelines states, ''An expectation in the scientific community is that research findings are made available regardless of the result.''
Karen Cator, a former Apple executive who directs the Office of Educational Technology at the Department of Education, said the clearinghouse reports on software should be ''taken with a grain of salt'' because they rely on standardized test scores. Those tests, Ms. Cator said, cannot gauge some skills that technology teaches, like collaboration, multimedia and research.
Ms. Cator's office is developing a new framework to measure the educational value of technology, but she advised schools and districts not to wait to invest in software like Cognitive Tutor.
''They know what their students need to know and what they need to be able to do,'' she said.
Real-Time Assessments
In Augusta, Dr. Allen, the math coordinator, said her district did not have the means to study the effectiveness of Cognitive Tutor formally. But she and her staff saw that low-achieving students who used it were able to join mainstream classes. And teachers appreciated the way the software transmits assessments in real time to Carnegie Learning, then kicks back a report indicating the strengths and weaknesses of each student.
Teachers ''just didn't know, skill by skill, the same type of data they are getting now,'' Dr. Allen said.
On the other hand, when the new state math test was given in March, 27 percent of the district's 11th graders did not pass, which Dr. Allen described as ''something that makes us not real excited.''
At the June meeting with Carnegie Learning's sales team, Dr. Allen said Cognitive Tutor could be worthwhile if the district, which has recently cut $7 million from its budget and furloughed employees for nine days, could scrape together the financing. ''Our negotiations are intense because we don't have any money,'' she said to laughter around the table.
In Georgia, where the state negotiates prices with publishers, an annual license for Cognitive Tutor software is $32 per student, and the workbook, which must be replaced annually, is $24 -- for a total of $336 over six years, a typical lifespan of a math textbook that costs about $120.
Ultimately, Dr. Allen's district did not have the money, so she focused on getting the most out of her staff. ''Giving them the right tools and resources certainly helps,'' she said, ''but our teachers are the ones making that difference.''
Gregory W. Capelli, co-chief executive of the Apollo Group, which runs the 400,000-student University of Phoenix and bought Carnegie Learning this summer, said his company first ran its own pilot project with the software and also examined independent research.
But Mr. Capelli, like others, relied at least in part on personal experience.
''My daughter, who's in eighth grade, used this product,'' he said.
''She would do very well'' in some lessons ''and not in others,'' Mr. Capelli said. ''What I liked about it is that once she got it, it would allow her to go on to the next part of the tree.''

HEADLINE: Post-Blackness

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Toure's book ''Who's Afraid of Post-Blackness: What It Means to Be Black Now,'' reviewed by Orlando Patterson (Sept. 25), sweeps across the ''post-black'' landscape in an America governed by a black president. We learn what it is like to be young, black and middle-class, but we do not learn what society is like as a result of black identity politics. The relationship is portrayed as unidirectional. Yet the civil rights, women's and gay rights movements have crowded out working-class politics (see, for example, Michael Kazin's Sept. 25 Op-Ed in The Times, ''Whatever Happened to the American Left?''). The post-black generation has lived in a world devoid of class politics even as the civil rights movements have grown. We cannot truly appreciate post-racialism unless we apprehend its personal self-absorption and political narrowness. 
ALICE AMSDEN Cambridge, Mass. The writer is a professor of development economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
To the Editor:
I'm not sure what Orlando Patterson meant when he wrote, ''Toure . . . seems to have unearthed here a new post-black sociological evil: counterfactual racism.'' It seems to me that racism is, and always has been, counterfactual.

HEADLINE: The Greed Police

 BODY:
Roger Lowenstein raises the question: Should S.E.C. regulators concentrate on insider-trader cases, which are relatively insignificant but give small investors confidence, or on preventing systemic risk in the financial system? The answer is that it should do both. Regulators are low-paid (in comparison with those they investigate) and are often lawyers who lack the skills to understand the type of securities (e.g., credit default swaps) that led to our recent economic collapse. 
Perhaps we could entice the type of people who created ''systemic risk'' to work for the S.E.C. if we compensated them in the manner they expect. If the regulators were guaranteed a bonus, consisting of a percentage of the money they recover, it would create an incentive to undertake difficult, lengthy investigations. Meanwhile, those staff members willing to accept their base salary, and the small bonuses that minor insider-trading cases produce, would continue to plod along, keeping traders honest and watching out for small investors.
ARTHUR D. APTOWITZ, Forest Hills, N.Y.
Lowenstein reveals that the S.E.C. appears to be operating under the hard-core efficient-markets hypothesis: that it is impossible for a money manager to consistently beat the market. This view was absolutely dominant in academia by the end of the 20th century. More recently, however, consistent out-performance of certain hedge funds seemed to present a stronger challenge to the hypothesis. Funds like SAC Capital, Goldman's Global Alpha, AQR and others seemed to be doing what the theory said was impossible -- consistently beating the market. But the S.E.C. seems to have clung steadfast to the efficient-markets hypothesis.

HEADLINE: Fruit Wines Move Into a Sophisticated Realm

BYLINE: By JAN ELLEN SPIEGEL

 BODY:
GUILFORD
SATURDAY afternoon at Bishop's Orchards Farm Market and Winery here and it's waiting room only to get to the wine tasting bar. No surprise, except that not a grape is being poured.
Bishop's Winery produces only fruit wines, as nongrape wines are known -- about a dozen and a half of them from tree fruit and berries grown on the more than 300 acres of this 140-year-old, sixth-generation family farm.
Far from the sickeningly sweet apple wines favored during the Boone's Farm cheap-drunk era of the 1970s, today's fruit wines -- in colors of striking crystalline jewel tones -- can be sophisticated, subtle and downright dry.
And in Connecticut they constitute a modest trend. In the last few years, some half-dozen farms and wineries have begun producing fruit wines to measurable success, capitalizing on shifts in tastes and generational preferences, not to mention what grows best in their own backyards. 
''It's another way of adding value to our products,'' said Keith Bishop, winemaker and co-chief executive of Bishop's Orchards with his cousin Jonathan Bishop. ''We're selling them in a different way that preserves the product as opposed to: you've got to sell it fresh or watch it rot.''
The winery opened in 2005, but the farm has been producing cider since the 1920s, so the owners already knew a thing or two about making the juice required for fruit wine.
Connecticut's original farm winery legislation in 1978 allowed wineries that grew their own fruit (grapes included) and produced wine on farm premises to sell wine at the farm on Sundays (unlike liquor stores); subsequent tweaks to the legislation have made operations like Bishop's viable economic bets. Farm wine designation now requires that only 25 percent of the fruit be grown by the winery owner, down from 51 percent. It allows the sale of wine by the glass and of wine produced by other farm wineries in the state. And just this year, new legislation allowed farm wines to be sold at farmers' markets, though not on Sundays and subject to local regulations.
Wayne Stitzer, a Connecticut-based winemaking consultant who helped school Mr. Bishop on the vagaries of fruit fermentation, flavor blending and aging, said he was getting far more requests for assistance with fruit wines than when he began his business 11 years ago -- a trend confirmed nationally by Michael Kaiser, director of communications for the trade group Wine America, who said anecdotal information showed that fruit wines seemed to be catching on most in the Midwest and on the East Coast, both of which are prime growing regions for fruits other than grapes.
Mr. Stitzer noted that going from fruit to wine can take as little as eight weeks at half the cost of grape wine. ''You don't have to be a business genius to figure out what that means,'' he said.
Most important, as regular wineries become entertainment destinations, he and others said, fruit wineries have become appealing stops for visitors who are not necessarily traditional wine drinkers.
''If you have an alternative fruit-based product made from something people are familiar with, they're more inclined to try it,'' he said. ''It gives them an option for something to buy.''
Fruit wines nowadays range from bone-dry to sweet, with alcohol contents typically around 11 percent, and upwards of 16 percent in dessert wines. In the same way grape wines don't taste like grapes, fruit wines only hint at the flavors of their components.
Single-fruit wines typically blend many varieties of one fruit. Some winemakers also produce wines from multiple fruits. ''It's taking beakers and flasks; putting in 90-10, 50-50, 60-40, see what the flavor profiles are,'' said Mr. Bishop of both single and multiple blends, which have whimsical names like Pearadise, from Bosc pears; Abby Road, from blackberries; Blushing Beauty Peach Wine; Amazing Grace, an apple wine mixed with cranberry juice; Happley ImPeared, Bishop's signature apple-pear wine; and Berry Best Friends, a new sweet mix of blueberry, blackberry and apple.
Fruit wines are typically aged in stainless steel tanks, except at Holmberg Orchards and Winery in Gales Ferry. This 1896 family farm branched into the wine arena in 2005 at the urging of the youngest Holmberg, Russell, fresh out of college with a horticulture degree and a business plan for wine.
Mr. Holmberg planted grapes, and while waiting for them to produce began making fruit wines -- blueberry, peach (for which he invented a machine to remove the pit), a dead dry Bartlett pear wine called Pearfection, and Three Sheets apple wine from a mix of heirloom varieties. While he ages the peach in stainless steel to maintain its ''bright aromas,'' Mr. Holmberg ages the apple four to six months in chardonnay barrels, the blueberry six months or longer in oak, and a portion of the pear in oak before mixing it back into the remainder in stainless.
''Apple wine really benefits not only from the flavor of the oak but also the air exchange,'' Mr. Holmberg said. ''It gives it color; it gives it complexity.''
Blueberry, he said, essentially is red wine. ''You've got to make red wine in a barrel. That was a no-brainer.''
At Jones Family Farm in Shelton, the sixth-generation owner Jamie Jones added grapes to the family's 400 acres in 1999 after seeing how family farms near Cornell, where he studied horticulture, had used wine to diversify. But with extra berries most seasons, fruit wine was an obvious endeavor and now accounts for about one-third of the farm's wine.
Both he and his winemaker, Larry McCulloch, who came from Chamard Vineyards in 2008, said fruit wines -- with fewer acids, sugars, tannins and complex flavors to work with -- can be trickier than grape wines. ''You have to be more diligent and watchful in the winery that things don't head south in fruit wine fermentation,'' Mr. Jones said.
White Silo Farm in Sherman has taken a different tack on fruit wine, specializing in small-batch wines from raspberries, blackberries, black currants and most curiously, rhubarb.
''Most people would not know it was not grape wine,'' the owner and winemaker, Eric Gorman, said of the rhubarb.
''We wanted to make something kind of unusual,'' he added, ''different from what everybody else was making.''
Mr. Gorman's father, Ralph, began winemaking as a hobby; the winery now goes through 10,000 pounds of rhubarb each season and typically sells out of the wine by November.
Makers of fruit wines all seem to agree that on one hand, consumers need a re-education to understand how fruit wines have evolved; on the other, younger generations come to fruit wines unencumbered by their old nasty reputation, willing to try it.
That was borne out at Bishop's tasting bar, where a post-Boone's Farm-age couple, Jaime White and Ryan Jaswell, tried fruit wines for the first time.
''I thought they'd be more sweet than they are,'' Ms. White said.
Mr. Jaswell added: ''They're not as fruity as I thought they were going to be. They still taste like wine. They're good.''
''They're really good,'' Ms. White said.
Kate Saucier has been drinking fruit wines for a few years and said they've never had a negative connotation for her. ''We're valley girls from Southington,'' she said with a chuckle, indicating her friend Christine Libby. ''We grew up with the apple harvest, and we love apple cider and pumpkin pie, so I think it just goes with where we live.''
Beyond Grapes
Fruit wines in Connecticut range in price from about $13 to just over $20. In addition to selling directly from the farm, most wineries distribute to stores. Winery days and hours generally change seasonally, and some close for the winter. Check winery Web sites for purchase information and hours.

HEADLINE: Grilled Chicken, That Temperamental Star

BYLINE: By DAVID SEGAL

 BODY:
THE sauce will not behave.
It is supposed to drip twice, on cue, from the bottom right-hand corner of a forkful of tortellini -- first as the fork is lifted above the plate and, second, after the fork pauses briefly in the air and starts to rise again.
Two drips. A sequence that lasts a second and a half, tops.
A dozen men at MacGuffin Films, a studio in Manhattan, are struggling to capture this moment. For more than an hour one recent afternoon, they huddle around a table rimmed with enormous stage lights, fussing over a casserole as if it's a movie star getting primped for a close-up. 
''Lights. Roll. Action. Drip!'' shouts Michael Somoroff, a veteran commercial director who has shot television ads for Red Lobster, Burger King, Papa John's and dozens of other fast-food and casual-dining chains. A specialist in the little-known world of tabletop directing -- named for the piece of furniture where most of the work is set -- Mr. Somoroff is hired to turn the most mundane and fattening staples of the American diet into luscious objects of irresistible beauty.
If you watch television, you've seen his work, and the work of the five or six other major players in this micro-niche of advertising. These men -- yes, they're all men -- make glossy vignettes that star butter-soaked scallops and glistening burgers. Their cameras swirl around fried chicken, tunnel through devil's food cake and gape as soft-serve cones levitate and spin.
Few outside the business know their names. But given the more than $4 billion in television air time bought by restaurant chains and food conglomerates each year, these directors arguably have some of the widest exposure of any commercial artists in the country. In a typical week, tens of millions of viewers see their work.
''Aside from movie directors,'' Mr. Somoroff says during a break in shooting, ''I don't know anyone with an audience as large as mine.''
On this particular afternoon, he is filming a commercial for a chain that did not want to see its name in this article. And you can sort of understand why. If you've ever been to a restaurant and thought, ''This does not look like the dish in the ad,'' here's the irony: The dish in the ad doesn't look like the dish in the ad, either.
This casserole shot, for instance, is an elaborate tango of artifice, technology and timing. The steam wafting over the dish comes not from the food, but from a stagehand crouched under a table with the kind of machine that unwrinkles trousers.
The hint of Alfredo sauce that appears when the fork emerges from the pasta? That's courtesy of tubes hidden in the back of the dish and hooked to what look like large hypodermic needles. Moments before each take, Mr. Somoroff yells, ''Ooze!'' That tells the guy with the needles, standing just outside of the frame, to start pumping.
As for that quarrelsome drip from the fork, it is the responsibility of Anthony DeRobertis, a special-effects rigger who holds his own hypodermic of sauce and is having a hard time synching with a hand model, a young man with a military haircut who is clutching the fork.
''Anthony, the second drip is about 10 minutes after the shot is over,'' says Mr. Somoroff after five or six takes, sounding faintly annoyed.
''I'm right on it,'' Mr. DeRobertis says.
''You're on it, but it's not dripping when it has to drip.''
A break is called and a tube is attached to Mr. DeRobertis's sauce injector, which is then taped near the bottom tine of the fork, in a way that's invisible to Mr. Somoroff's immense Photo-Sonics camera.
Sauce and fork are finally in unison. After a few more tries, Mr. Somoroff has a take he likes enough to show to reps from the client and its ad agency, a group of whom are waiting in a nearby room that is decked out with a large high-definition TV. The pasta appears moist, the steam organic and the minuet of drip and hand nothing more than a diner on the verge of a blissful bite.
''I make my living basically taking food and painting a reality with it,'' says Mr. Somoroff, leaning back in a chair in his office as the team preps another set-up. ''And if I succeed in a given moment, you're going to go buy that dish because you're going to identify with the experience we've created. To do that with something as banal as food is the challenge. I mean, it's easy to go out and shoot a beautiful sunset or a beautiful girl. They're beautiful, O.K.?''
He gestures toward the middle of the studio.
''I've got a noodle over here.''
THIS is a good moment to be a tabletop director in the big leagues, particularly if you specialize in food. Low- and mid-priced chain restaurants are one of the few segments of the economy that decided, during the recession and in its aftermath, to spend as much or more on advertising than they did in the years before.
Fast-food, casual-dining and pizza chains, as well as what are lumped together as ''doughnut and coffee restaurants,'' spent $300 million more on TV ads in 2010 than they did in 2007, according to Kantar Media, a market research firm. If patterns hold, the numbers will be even larger this year.
''Generally speaking, restaurant chains spend about 3 percent of revenue on advertising,'' says Michael Gallo, an analyst at C. L. King & Associates. ''Because these restaurant systems are large and have density, television is an easy way to reach customers in a cost-effective way.''
And any restaurant chain that forswears TV ads is in serious trouble.
''If you come off television, when your sales dip, it takes a long time to get them back to where they were before stopped advertising,'' says Michael Branigan, vice president for marketing at Sizzler. ''There are a ton of studies that show this. You lose brain share of your customers, and it is expensive to get revenues up again. If I stopped advertising, Sizzler's revenue would be down, minimally, 10 to 15 percent for the year.''
Typically, companies use television commercials to introduce new products or to remind consumers about old ones. Regardless, the goal is the same: show the product, and do it in a way that makes people want to eat the TV.
Tabletop directors don't handle the part of the ad where the family walks into the restaurant, or where Mom looks for a whisk. That's farmed out to someone else. But say you're the Checkers chain and you want to unveil ''Chicken Bites,'' a fried-chicken offering. You need to distinguish these ''poppable'' treats from a few dozen others on the market. And you need to give a hint of what they taste like.
''It's breaded, seasoned chicken, so to the naked eye you can't really tell,'' said Kris Miotke, senior director of marketing at Checkers. ''The question was, How do you define a fun, bite-size product in a way that shows both the inside and the outside?''
How about a hand tearing open a Chicken Bite? ''Me, personally, I don't want hands in my shot. I want the food to speak for itself.''
To solve this problem -- how to create a hands-free, fried-chicken reveal, if you will -- Checkers hired Michael Schrom. For 11 years, he has worked in 16,000 square feet of space in Silvercup Studios in Long Island City, Queens, in the same building where ''30 Rock,'' ''Gossip Girl'' and other shows are filmed. Nearly all his clients sell food or beverages, among them Domino's, McDonald's, Applebee's and Smucker's.
''That took about 40 takes,'' says Mr. Schrom of the Chicken Bites shot. There was no sleight of hand; each bite was cut open, pushed back together, then dropped on a table. The goal was to see moist white meat when it bounced.
''It's far harder to get a cookie break with chocolate chips,'' Mr. Schrom says. ''We went through 100 cookies for Nestle's on one shoot. We knew when we got it because we could hear the clients in the other room, applauding.''
Mr. Schrom has the eyeglasses of an architect and the relaxed, contented air of a man highly entertained by his job. On this day, he is filming for a national chain -- one that also requested anonymity -- capturing what he calls ''flavor cues.'' In one shot, a stagehand pours chocolate syrup over a sheet of caramel. (You can almost hear a voiceover purring, ''Chocolate.'') In another, cream bubbles up in a cup of coffee. In real time, these moments barely register. In slow-motion playbacks, with a digital camera that shoots up to 1,600 frames a second, the images are almost erotic. Which is no accident.
''You're using the same part of your brain -- porn, food,'' Mr. Schrom says during a break. ''It's going in the same section; it's that visual cortex that connects to your most basic senses. What we're trying to do is be the modern-day Pavlovs and ring your bell with these images.''
He has several food stylists who work in a huge kitchen next to his set. They start with the very same food and recipes used in the restaurants and stores.
In part, this is a truth-in-advertising issue. Everyone knows that in 1970, the Federal Trade Commission settled a complaint against the Campbell Soup Company after its ad agency slipped marbles into a bowl in ads featuring its vegetable soup, apparently to force more veggies to the surface. That put a scare into the industry that endures to this day.
Anything that flatters the food, of course, is fair game, and that includes gimmicks you're unlikely to find in a fridge. Glue is used to keep spaghetti on forks and pizzas in place. The ice in a beverage might be made of acrylic and cost $500 a cube. The frost coming off a beer could be a silicone gel, mixed with powder and water.
The difference between enhancement and fakery, though, becomes a little murky, and some directors tiptoe right up to, and well past, the marbles-in-the-soup line. If the tomatoes in a client's red wine reduction aren't visible, some fresh ones may be sliced up and tossed in. On rare occasions, the food you see on screen is merely a facsimile of the product.
''We used lard and Karo syrup for an ice cream client,'' says David Deahl, a tabletop director in Chicago. ''The lights we have melt the product so quickly that it's impossible to make ice cream look like ice cream. So we got permission from our client to fake it.''
That's a rarity. Mr. Deahl and other directors say they expend far more effort making the food look authentic than they do glamorizing it. The risk is overpromising, a topic that comes up a lot on sets.
''It's all about a certain approachability,'' Mr. Somoroff says. ''If it looks too good, consumers are going to think it isn't real.''
Great tabletop directors are like makeup artists who want their models to look ravishing, but in a girl-next-door way. Plausibly scrumptious -- that is the ideal. Find that sweet spot, and clients say a campaign can bump up revenue 5 to 10 percent the weekend after the ads start to run.
UNTIL the early 1970s, most TV commercials for food and drink were static, shot with a zoomed-in, wide-angle lens mounted on a camera that didn't move. Then came Elbert Budin, a former still-life magazine photographer, who set up a studio not far from Penn Station in Midtown Manhattan; his pet finches had the run of the place. He used micro lenses placed two inches from the product, close enough to see individual droplets on a soda can. With the help of a mini jib, he would swing the camera in graceful arcs.
''Before him, tabletop was just' shoot the box, shoot the label,' '' says Santiago Suarez, who worked with Mr. Budin for six years before setting off on a successful tabletop career of his own. ''Elbert wanted the product to have a three-dimensional feel. He wanted you to smell it.''
If tabletop has a vocabulary, Mr. Budin coined many of the words. He popularized prep shots (a kind of back story for the product, typically ingredients being chopped), crave shots (self-explanatory) and hero shots (a glorifying farewell look at the product, usually in the last few seconds of the ad).
And it is from Mr. Elbert that we get one of the lasting visual tropes of American advertising: flying food. Ever since he launched an orange through a thin sheet of water for Sunkist -- showing in gorgeous slow motion the hole left by the fruit -- everything that you can put in your mouth and store in a pantry has been hurtling through the air.
''Food has to be in motion to have character,'' says Alex Fernbach, another Budin acolyte, who now works at Arf & Company, a studio in Hoboken, N.J. ''It gives food a personality.''
It also gives prop men a challenge. Like Ed Fountain, who builds food-tossing devices in a large, cluttered workshop in Mr. Schrom's studio.
''We recently did a shot where this doughnut was tumbling through the air and through a curtain of sugar,'' he said. As he spoke, he reached under a table and brought out a pair of matching, foot-and-a-half-long black catapults, powered by air cylinders, which he'd originally built for a Long John Silver's commercial in which shrimp collided.
''I put the doughnut in here,'' he says, pointing to the end of one catapult. ''And I had it strike a paintbrush to get it tumbling. Then I connected it to a device that bumped a table and sent up the sugar right as the doughnut passed through.''
You could throw the doughnut by hand, he explained. But with a rig, as everyone in this industry calls these little Rube Goldbergs, you get the exact same results, over and over, which means fewer takes.
Fewer takes means less time -- and time is always in short supply these days. Most directors charge by the day, with fees starting at $60,000 and reaching as high as $150,000. But clients who a few years ago would be content with one or two good shots in a day now want five or six.
''The era of the prima donna tabletop director is over,'' Mr. Deahl says. ''There was a time when a client would say 'I don't like this shot,' and a director would throw them out of the studio. Those guys are out of business. The economics of today -- we have to squeeze three days of shooting into two and four days into three, for the same dollars.''
Mr. Deahl recently finished a two-week shoot for Subway, in which 25 shots were filmed in seven days.
''Everything has to be perfect and approved by the client all along the way,'' he said. ''The clients march into the kitchen and bless the way the sandwich looks, then we take it to the set for rehearsals. The rehearsals are previewed, and the client passes judgment again. Seven people, looking at a sandwich, saying things like: 'There's a hole here. Move that piece of meat.' ''
THE studio at MacGuffin Films, on the first floor of a nondescript office building near Astor Place in Manhattan, has been home to some canny feats of visual theater. It has served as the setting for Olive Garden's training kitchen in Italy as well as Burger King's grill. Once, for a seafood restaurant, a huge water tank was installed, complete with fish and a coral reef.
But, a few weeks ago, the crew here faced what sounds like its most daunting mission yet: to make ''pizza pasta'' look yummy.
Pizza pasta, it turns out, is just what it sounds like: pasta covered with mozzarella cheese, pepperoni, sausage, peppers. Never heard of it? Hope to avoid it? O'Charley's, a casual dining chain with more than 200 restaurants, mostly in the Southeast, wants to change that.
''It'll be one of our 'eight under $8' dishes in January,'' says Laurie Katapski, O'Charley's director of marketing, who is standing near MacGuffin's huge kitchen one afternoon. ''We look at food trends, we do concept screening, we field-test our products with customers and pizza pasta rose to the top.''
Nearby, Mary Divett, a food stylist with a British accent, tweezes slices of pepperoni into place on top of the dish. Then she spears the platonic ideal of a fork of pizza pasta and glues it in place.
The dish is eventually passed to a stagehand, who heats up the mozzarella and welds it to the noodles on the fork, using what looks like an industrial hair dryer. A hero shot is being set up, and not just any hero shot.
''It's a cheese pull,'' Anthony DeRobertis says, using the term of art for hot cheese in motion. ''They're really difficult when it comes to pizza because every company has a different idea of how many cheese bridges there should be. It can take hours to get it right.''
The O'Charley's cheese pull is less time-consuming. For 45 minutes, Mr. Somoroff shuttles between the set and the room where Ms. Katapski and her colleagues await the film footage. The key is getting the exact amount of cheese to stretch and give way, along with a little bit of motion on the surface of the dish, so the other noodles don't look paralyzed. Then again, too much motion makes the shot look fake.
It takes a while, but the O'Charley's contingent and Mr. Somoroff finally like what they see.
''I like the sloppiness of this one,'' says Ms. Katapski, as a cheese pull plays in a loop on a TV screen.
''It's pretty, yeah,'' chimes an ad rep.
''Plenty of appetite appeal,'' adds another.
''Pizza pasta!'' someone yells, triumphantly.

HEADLINE: An Ugly Forecast That's Been Right Before

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
LET'S face it: economic forecasting is an act of sheer hubris. Which, of course, only incites people to do it.
The stock market offers its predictions, and, occasionally, it's even right. As the economist Paul Samuelson once put it: ''The stock market has called nine of the last five recessions.''
Economists have an even worse record, particularly when it comes to predicting downturns. In 1929, for instance, the Harvard Economic Society declared that a depression was ''outside the range of probability.'' Whoops. 
Then there is the matter of the last recession. With the benefit of hindsight, we now know that the downturn began in December 2007. Few people realized it at the time. A survey by Blue Chip Economic Indicators that month found that, as a group, economists believed that the economy would grow by 2.2 percent in 2008. Instead, it began to shrink.
Are we heading into another recession now? Again, the consensus says we're not.
But at least one organization with an exceptionally good track record says another recession may already be here. That is the Economic Cycle Research Institute, a private forecasting firm based in Manhattan. It was founded by Geoffrey H. Moore, an economist who helped originate the practice of using leading indicators to predict business cycles. Mr. Moore died in 2000, but the team he trained is still at work.
Relying on a series of proprietary indexes, the institute correctly predicted the beginning and the end of the last recession. Over the last 15 years, it has gotten all of its recession calls right, while issuing no false alarms.
That's why it's worth paying attention to its current forecast. It's chilling: as bad as the economy has been, it's about to get worse.
In the institute's view, the United States, which is struggling to recover from the last downturn, is lurching into a new one. ''If the United States isn't already in a recession now it's about to enter one,'' says Lakshman Achuthan, the institute's chief operations officer.
It's just a forecast. But if it's borne out, the timing will be brutal, and not just for portfolio managers and incumbent politicians. Millions of people who lost their jobs in the 2008-9 recession are still out of work. And the unemployment rate in the United States remained at 9.1 percent in September.
More pain is coming, says Mr. Achuthan. He thinks the unemployment rate will certainly go higher. ''I wouldn't be surprised if it goes back up into double digits,'' he says.
At the moment, the institute is sticking its collective neck out.
Compare the institute's forecast with the latest Blue Chip survey, which was released on Friday. In it, the consensus is that the economy is slowing, but still growing modestly, and that it will continue to do so. On average, the economists included in the tally foresaw a growth rate of 2 percent in 2012. In January, the consensus prediction for 2012 was a growth rate of 3.1 percent.
Economists have been ratcheting down their projections, recognizing that the recovery has been so weak that it won't take much to set the economy back.
A dark cloud hovers over the euro zone. Greece is increasingly perceived as likely to default on its debt, causing as-yet-unknown problems for the global financial system. Spain, Portugal and Ireland are already in downturns. Last week, Jan Hatzius and Dominic Wilson, two Goldman Sachs economists, predicted that France and Germany would soon fall into a ''mild recession,'' contributing to a slowdown in the United States, where they put the odds of a new recession at 40 percent.
In Congressional testimony last week, Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, was also downbeat. He said that the economy was ''close to faltering'' and that the Fed had lowered its own forecast, adding that the Fed is prepared to intervene as needed. He did not predict a recession, however.
Mr. Achuthan, on the other hand, says that the gross domestic product rate is likely to go negative by the first quarter of 2012, if not sooner. He told me last week that he couldn't tell exactly when the recession would start -- or whether it had already begun. The institute made its recession call only after an array of economic indicators showed a ''pronounced, pervasive and persistent'' downturn consistent with a recession, he says. By contrast, in the summer of 2010, when some market bears interpreted the decline in one of the institute's indexes as a signal that a recession was in the offing, the institute said the pattern pointed not to recession, but only to weakness.
Now, he says, the pattern is clear.
This time, Mr. Achuthan says, a host of leading and coincident indexes -- those that suggest activity down the road, and those that measure current movements --are all pointing strongly toward recession.
The institute's U.S. Leading Diffusion Index, for example, has dipped into territory that, with only one exception, would have signaled the recessions of the last 60 years. The single exception was in a short-lived downturn in 1966-7.
In addition, its U.S. Coincident Index has moved into territory that would have signaled recessions over those six decades, with three exceptions. Those were dips in September 2005, after Hurricane Katrina; in March 1993, after a huge storm on the east coast of North America, and in July 1952, after a steel strike. In none of those cases did the two indexes reach recession territory at the same time, as they have now, he says.
TAKEN as a whole, he says, these and other indicators are quite clear. ''We've entered a vicious cycle, and it's too late: a recession can't be averted,'' he says.
Unfortunately, this isn't the end of the institute's gloomy prognostications. What's worse, he says, is that the business cycle appears to have become shorter than it was from the mid-80s until the start of the last recession, an era that has sometimes been called ''the Great Moderation.''
For the foreseeable future, he says, ''more frequent recessions are likely to be the norm.''

SINCE the start of the financial crisis, many money managers have been predicting that investors would gravitate to shares of large, industry-leading companies. Yet since the start of 2008, large-capitalization stocks have lagged riskier small-company shares, belying their reputation as ports in an economic storm.
That changed a bit in the third quarter -- relatively speaking. While mutual funds that invest in blue-chip stocks suffered major losses in the late summer, they fell considerably less than small-cap portfolios. The average fund that invests in large-cap growth stocks fell 15.6 percent in the three months ended Sept. 30, versus the average 22.1 percent loss suffered by small-cap growth funds. 
The bigger the stocks, the less painful the performance during the last quarter. Traditionally, stocks of companies with a market value of around $10 billion are considered large caps. But large-cap funds with average holdings of at least $25 billion held up slightly better -- losing 14.7 percent in the quarter, according to the fund tracker Morningstar.
''In the latter half of last year and the first half of this year, 'the riskier the better' was the mantra,'' said Bradley P. Hinton, co-manager of the Weitz Partners Value fund. ''But in the last quarter, you've seen smaller companies sell off stronger, which is more what you'd expect in periods of uncertainty.''
What changed?
Sam Stovall, chief equity strategist at Standard & Poor's Capital IQ, said the relative outperformance of large caps could reflect the nature of this sell-off, which appears to be focused on the weakening global economy, he said. Blue-chip stocks tend to hold up better than the rest of the market in such conditions. By contrast, he said: ''The last two mega-meltdowns have not really been economically driven. The 2000-2 bear was the popping of the tech bubble, which directly affected large-cap tech stocks. And 2008 was triggered by the meltdown in large-cap financials.''
Timothy Mulrenan, co-manager of the Pioneer Fundamental Growth fund, which finished in the top 5 percent of all large-cap growth funds in the third quarter, cited a couple of other factors.
For starters, the economic recovery that began in June 2009 has matured to the point where corporate profit growth has peaked and is now slowing. ''Once you move past peak growth rates, then sentiment does shift,'' Mr. Mulrenan said. Investors are showing a preference for larger companies with a proven record of thriving in tough economic times or that stand to benefit from faster-growing markets outside the United States, he said.
''This economic environment,'' he said, ''certainly hasn't hurt the earnings of a company like Apple at all,'' referring to one of the stocks in the fund.
Nor has it damaged the long-term prospects of a company like MasterCard, another fund holding, he said. It assumes no credit risk on transactions and is therefore somewhat insulated from a weak economy, he said. And while the economy could slow MasterCard's growth, the company generates around 60 percent of its revenue from overseas.
MR. MULRENAN added that another reason for the relative attractiveness of large stocks is their relatively favorable valuations.
Donald A. Yacktman, manager of of the Yacktman Fund, makes a similar argument.
Mr. Yacktman, whose portfolio finished among the top 4 percent of all large-cap value funds in the third quarter, favors dominant companies with predictable cash flows and strong balance sheets -- companies like the News Corporation., PepsiCo, Microsoft and Procter & Gamble, he said.
''On a relative basis, I don't think I can think of another period of time where so many of these companies were selling at such cheap prices relative to other companies or to U.S. Treasuries,'' he said.
Many large caps are also paying dividends that now exceed the yields of long-term Treasury bonds, offering investors more of a cushion in a volatile market, said William C. Nygren, manager of the Oakmark Fund, which fared better than more than 80 percent of its large-cap peers for the first nine months of the year.
''There's an amazing list of large-cap names where you can get over a 3 percent dividend yield and price-earnings ratios in the single digits,'' Mr. Nygren said. Examples in his portfolio, he said, include companies like Microsoft, which yields more than 3 percent and trades at nine times next year's estimated earnings per share, and Merck, which yields nearly 5 percent and trades at eight times next year's estimated earnings.
Still, this doesn't mean that all large-cap stocks will offer investors protection if the economy worsens.
That's why Thomas H. Forester, chief investment officer for the Forester Value fund, has been raising cash in his portfolio and making subtle shifts. ''We try to over- and under-weight companies within a sector based on the environment we're in,'' he said.
For example, the prospects for falling oil prices because of the slowing global economy and problems in Europe could hurt oil drillers. Instead of fleeing energy altogether, Mr. Forester said, he recently sold his position in Marathon Oil and has shifted a good deal of that money into Exxon Mobil, a more diversified energy company with strong cost controls.
It's important even for large-cap investors to take precautions. ''It's like when you're driving,'' he said. ''When you go around a curve, you slow down, and when you straighten out you speed up. Well, it sure feels like we're in the curves when it comes to this economy.''

HEADLINE: Wall Street Protest Spurs Online Dialogue on Inequity

BYLINE: By JENNIFER PRESTON; Al Baker and Anna M. Phillips contributed reporting.

 BODY:
What began as a small group of protesters expressing their grievances about economic inequities last month from a park in New York City has evolved into an online conversation that is spreading across the country on social media platforms.
Inspired by the populist message of the group known as Occupy Wall Street, more than 200 Facebook pages and Twitter accounts have sprung up in dozens of cities during the past week, seeking volunteers for local protests and fostering discussion about the group's concerns. 
Some 900 events have been set up on Meetup.com, and blog posts and photographs from all over the country are popping up on the WeArethe99Percent blog on Tumblr from people who see themselves as victims of not just a sagging economy but also economic injustice.
''I don't want to be rich. I don't want to live a lavish lifestyle,'' wrote a woman on Tumblr, describing herself as a college student worried about the burden of student debt. ''I'm worried. I'm scared, thinking about the future shakes me. I hope this works. I really hope this works.''
The online conversation has grown at the same time that street protests have taken place in several other cities last week, including Boston, Los Angeles, Chicago and Washington. A Web site, Occupy Together, is trying to aggregate the online conversations and the off-line activities.
''We are not coordinating anything,'' said Justin Wedes, 26, a former high school science teacher from Brooklyn who helps manage one of the movement's main Twitter accounts, @OccupyWallStNYC. ''It is all grass roots. We are just trying to use it to disseminate information, tell stories, ask for donations and to give people a voice.''
To help get the word out about a rally at 3 p.m. Saturday in Washington Square Park, the group turned to its Facebook and Twitter accounts. ''If you are one of the 99 percent, this is your meeting,'' the Facebook invitation said. Nearly 700 people replied on Facebook saying that they would be there.
More than 1,000 demonstrators arrived at Washington Square Park for the rally, many of them after marching from the encampment they had established three weeks ago in Zuccotti Park, in Lower Manhattan.
During their march, protesters kept to the sidewalks and out of traffic in a purposeful attempt to prevent arrests. Once at Washington Square Park, they held meetings until the early evening, when the crowd dispersed and protesters made their way back to Zuccotti Park, where they were welcomed with loud cheers.
While people in New York are still dominating the conversation on Twitter, an analysis of Twitter data on Friday showed that almost half of the posts were made in other parts of the country, primarily in Los Angeles and San Francisco, Chicago and Washington, as well as Texas, Florida and Oregon, according to Trendrr, a social media analytics firm.
Mark Ghuneim, founder and chief executive officer of Trendrr, said the Twitter conversation was producing an average of 10,000 to 15,000 posts an hour on Friday about Occupy Wall Street, with most people sharing links from news sites, Tumblr, YouTube and Trendsmap.
Washington's National Air and Space Museum was closed after demonstrators tried to enter the building with signs.
''This is more of a growing conversation than something massive as we have seen from hurricanes and with people passing away,'' Mr. Ghuneim said. ''The conversation for this has a strong and steady heartbeat that is spreading. We're seeing the national dialogue morph into pockets of local and topic-based conversation.''
In Egypt, the We Are All Khaled Said Facebook page was started 10 months before the uprising last January to protest police brutality. The page had more than 400,000 members before it was used to help propel protesters into Tahrir Square. Occupy Wall Street's Facebook page began a few weeks ago and has 138,000 members.
Yet it represents only a sliver of the conversation taking place on Facebook about the group's anticorporate message. Unlike in Egypt, where people found one another on one Facebook page, geographically based Occupy Facebook pages have cropped up, reflecting the loosely organized approach of the group.
These Occupy pages around the country are being used not only to echo the issues being discussed in New York about jobs, corporate greed and budget cuts, but also to talk about other problems closer to home.
In Tennessee, for example, there is an Occupy Tennessee Facebook page, as well as pages for Occupy Memphis, Occupy Knoxville, Occupy Clarksville, Occupy Chattanooga, Occupy Murfreesboro and Occupy Nashville, which helped get out the word about a lunchtime protest in Nashville's Legislative Plaza on Friday that drew several hundred protesters with some bearing signs with the movement's motto: ''We are the 99 percent.''
The center of the movement's media operation is in Zuccotti Park, where several hundred people have been camping since Sept. 17.
On Friday morning, operation central consisted of a few tables and chairs clustered around a generator, with a few volunteers editing video, posting updates for the group's social media sites on laptops and staffing the live video feed for a channel called Global Revolution on Livestream.com.
On YouTube, at least 10,000 videos tagged ''occupy wall street'' have been uploaded in the past month. A video showing female protesters being fencing in and sprayed with pepper spray by the police is the most viewed of the protest, according to Matt McLernon, a spokesman for YouTube.
In addition to the videos posted from New York, Mr. McLernon said, videos have also been uploaded from Boston, Seattle, San Antonio and St. Louis, as well as from Oklahoma and Vermont.
Showing that YouTube can be used by both sides, the New York Police Department has uploaded its own videos of the protests on YouTube, including of the massive demonstration at the Brooklyn Bridge on Oct. 1 that led to 700 arrests.
But the group is not relying exclusively on social media platforms or the Internet to deliver its message. The second edition of The Occupied Wall Street Journal, a four-page broadsheet, was published on Saturday.
Online Correction: October 8, 2011, Saturday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this article misstated the name of one of the movement's main Twitter accounts. It is @OccupyWallStNYC, not @OccupyWallStreetNYC.

HEADLINE: Fixing the Post Office

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Reading the Writing on the Envelope'' (Digital Domain, Oct. 2), which described the quandary facing the United States Postal Service: 
A primary problem for the postal service is that its valuable, first-class mail deliveries are suffering while bulk, lower classes continue to stress the system. And its delivery mechanisms are becoming more inappropriate for the total volume of service.
Many changes are needed. First, I suggest getting rid of all postal rates except first class. If a bank wants to send me yet another credit card application, or if the local discount store wants to make me an offer I can't refuse, or if a charitable organization is requesting a contribution, let it pay full rather than ''standard'' rates.
Second, with the subsequent reduction in ''junk'' mail, delivery patterns could be adjusted to consolidate physical post offices. One of the postal service's great contributions has been ZIP codes. These codes would allow a dynamic analysis of those delivery patterns: If a specific post office delivered a certain volume of mail to its existing set of ZIP codes before ''standard'' deliveries ended, how many ZIP codes could it now add to maintain the same volume?

Why Taxes 'Must' Climb
To the Editor:
In ''The Problem With 'No New Taxes' '' (Economic View, Oct. 2) Tyler Cowen said that ''taxes will eventually go up, because they must.'' But one explanation for that ''must'' is not often heard: Our nation went to war in Afghanistan and Iran without raising taxes to pay for that war.
On the contrary, President George W. Bush cut taxes, thereby further postponing the payment. As conservatives like to say, ''There are no free lunches.'' So taxes must go up, not because of liberal profligacy or Keynesian theory, but simply because the time has come to pay the war bill.

Merrill Lynch's Rescue
To the Editor:
Re ''Profits, but No Joy, at Merrill'' (Oct. 2), which looked at how the former Merrill Lynch is now a thriving part of Bank of America:
Merrill employees are angry because their bonuses and perhaps jobs are on the line as a result of losses elsewhere in Bank of America's units. But where would the employees be if Merrill hadn't been rescued in 2008 by Bank of America, which was subsequently bailed out by the taxpayers? Frank Drobot

HEADLINE: One High School Band and the Changes It Wrought

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER KELLY. 
Christopher Kelly is a film critic for The Fort Worth Star-Telegram

 BODY:
The newly released documentary ''Thunder Soul'' tells a story that in its contours may seem familiar to most moviegoers.
On one level, it's an ''inspirational teacher'' tale, a real-life ''Stand and Deliver'' or ''Mr. Holland's Opus,'' about Conrad Johnson, a teacher who, in the late 1960s, formed a school stage band at Kashmere High School in Houston. The band garnered international acclaim and transformed the lives of many of its young musicians.
But the film, directed by Mark Landsman, is also a portrait of both the cruelties and unexpected graces of time, much like Michael Apted's famed ''Up'' documentary series, which has chronicled the lives of a group of young British students at seven-year intervals. 
Mr. Landsman's story centers on the 2008 reunion of the Kashmere Stage Band for a pair of tribute concerts honoring Mr. Johnson, then 92, known as Prof. Mr. Landsman followed the preparations for these concerts, and his film movingly juxtaposes images of the band members in their youth with scenes of them in the present day, grayer, heavier and struggling to blow the trumpet with as much gusto as they once did.
Yet what makes ''Thunder Soul'' resonate most powerfully is its urgent, underlying message about the value of arts education. The film, which opened in select cities in September and is expanding nationwide throughout October, arrives just a few months after the Texas Legislature passed a budget that slashed $4 billion in financing from public schools. In such lean economic times, money for arts programs -- which allowed scores of young students at Kashmere in the late 1960s and '70s to flourish -- is viewed as dispensable.
''It amazes me where our priorities are at in terms of the arts in public education,'' Mr. Landsman said in an online interview. At his own high school in suburban Chicago, he said, ''We had a dark room. We had a film program. We had extraordinary resources at our fingertips largely because we were in a school district with good support.''
The filmmaker, who has served in artist-in-residence programs at several schools and once taught in New York City, added: ''That's when I was shocked. Those public schools had to fight tooth and nail for things I took for granted.''
The story of the Kashmere Stage Band was not necessarily a forgotten one. Throughout the 1970s, the band regularly competed in regional and national music tournaments. In 1972, the all-black group won the All-American High School Stage Band Festival in Mobile, Ala., during the tenure of George Wallace, that state's segregationist governor.
More recently, in 2006, Now-Again Records issued ''Texas Thunder Soul 1968-1974,'' a compilation of the band's recordings made by Mr. Johnson, who died in 2008, just a day after the second of the Kashmere reunion concerts.
Mr. Landsman said he got the idea for ''Thunder Soul'' after hearing an NPR report on the group in 2006.
The film nonetheless manages to capture a fresh aspect of the Kashmere Stage Band story: the lifelong effects the experience had on its members. Craig Baldwin, one of the documentary's main subjects, served as the music director for the 2008 reunion concerts and poignantly confesses in the film that he was drifting toward a life of crime before joining the band. Another member, Gerald Calhoun, cultivated a professional music career, writing for the 1980s singer Pebbles and performing in Europe.
''I put all my focus and attention on getting into that band,'' Mr. Calhoun recalled in a recent interview. ''I was really small, and the bass guitar was basically like my voice, where I could be seen and heard.''
The film is being presented by Jamie Foxx (he also has an executive producer credit). Mr. Foxx has said it mirrored his own experiences with inspiring music teachers as a student in Terrell, Tex.
''Thunder Soul'' had its premiere at the 2010 South by Southwest Film Festival, where it won an audience award. The film was also nominated last year for an Independent Spirit Award. (It is not eligible for this year's Oscar race: according to a representative for the film's United States distributor, Roadside Attractions, it had an Oscar-qualifying run in 2010, but was not nominated.)
As for the film's real-world impact, Paul A. Hardin, who took over as principal at Kashmere High in July 2010, said ''Thunder Soul'' had been ''a serious shot in the arm'' for a school that in recent years has struggled with low enrollment and a poor public image.
But the school cannot escape financial realities. The new state budget -- which reduced financing to the Houston Independent School District for the 2011-12 school year by more than $77 million -- forced Mr. Hardin to eliminate the school's choir program. (The school's jazz band, which is the modern-day iteration of the 1970s-era stage band, continues to be financed and regularly performs with the alumni group, the Kashmere Reunion Stage Band.)
Mr. Hardin said he was trying to find a way to reinstate the choir program and other electives that were dropped and that he hoped Kashmere would be able to build on the momentum created by ''Thunder Soul.'' He said the great lesson of the film, which was screened for students in September, was that it showed the children what a previous generation had achieved at their oft-maligned school.
''Working on the good life, that's been our theme,'' Mr. Hardin said. ''Not just dreaming of the good life, but actually working on it. That really came alive to the kids when they saw the movie.''

QUESTIONS ON THE REACH
OF IRAN'S INFLUENCE IN IRAQ
As the United States draws down its forces in Iraq, fears abound that Iran will simply move into the vacuum and extend its already substantial political influence more deeply through the soft powers of culture and commerce. Iran has emerged empowered in Iraq over the last eight years, and it has a sympathetic Shiite-dominated government to show for it, but for what so far are rather obscure reasons, it has been unable to extend its reach.

MOVING ATLANTA CYCLORAMA
The Atlanta Cyclorama has been thrilling audiences in its present location since 1921.

There is talk of moving it elsewhere in the city. A new location might give the cyclorama more pop, but messing with it is not a popular idea. Page 12
G.O.P.'S EDUCATION GOALS
For a generation, there has been loose bipartisan agreement in Washington that the federal government has a necessary role to play in the nation's 15,000 school districts, primarily by using money to compel states to raise standards.

GIDDY WINNIPEG RECLAIMS
LOST PRARIE COMPANION
After an absence of 15 years, the Jets and the N.H.L. have returned to Winnipeg, Manitoba. Which is a good thing because the emotions sweeping the citizens of that prairie city at their beloved club's rebirth have grown to a pitch so fevered that they are practically uncontainable. The residents of Winnipeg are as ecstatic now as they were heartbroken in 1996, when, despite a two-year Save the Jets campaign, their N.H.L. team moved to Phoenix. Page 1
THE POINT OF THE EXTRA POINT
The first four weeks of the N.F.L. season have been filled with surprises, but there has been one constant: the extra point. For the better part of a decade, the accuracy rate for extra points has hovered around 99 percent, making the kick itself seem equal parts automatic and superfluous, Dave Seminara writes. All that precision raises the question: what is the point of the extra point? Page 2
POSSIBLE CURE FOR THE JETS
Any hope the Jets have of toppling New England rests with their ability to disrupt and harass quarterback Tom Brady as they did during their playoff victory in January, writes Ben Shpigel. But the Jets cannot win unless they score more points, a reality that this week in particular seems at once a monumental undertaking and a not-totally-unreasonable possibility. Page 2

HEADLINE: Always the Cook

BYLINE: By CHRIS NEUGENT. 
As told to Patricia R. Olsen.

 BODY:
MY parents were a big inspiration. My mom started college in her 40s and graduated magna cum laude at 50. My dad became a route sales driver for a bread company at 18 and rose to vice president for the largest commercial baker in Texas before he retired.
I learned the fundamentals of the food business from my father. I remember visiting stores with him when I was a kid and helping him straighten the loaves of bread on the rack. He taught me the importance of having the best-tasting food on the shelf. 
I had several jobs for his company growing up. My first was mowing the lawn, and through high school and college I drove bread trucks.
Attending college in the East -- at Princeton -- was a huge change. The only other time I had been out of Texas was on a weekend trip to Arkansas. I was naive as a kid could be, and the guys I lived with taught me a lot. After graduating with an economics degree in 1983, I sold investments in Dallas for five years. It wasn't a great fit, but it was a good learning experience. Next I joined Frito-Lay as an analyst. After three years as a numbers guy, I decided to return to sales. That put me back in a frontline position, driving a truck again, selling and servicing supermarkets and convenience stores. I tell my son that I've been selling food in a bag ever since.
I recall visiting a store in Terrell, Tex., one Fourth of July. Chips and that holiday go together somehow, so I was able to empty my truck there that day. But the retail business can be tough. One of the hardest-selling environments I ever experienced was Houston.
Frito-Lay had 70 percent market share there, but my group still had the same sales growth targets as our colleagues across the country. Convincing one of the convenience store chains to give us 12 displays in each of its several hundred stores was probably the most difficult sale my team ever made. These were small stores, and we already had 10 displays in each one, so we were pushing the envelope. But it worked out well. In the food business, you don't want to try to force a product on retailers and have them regret the purchase.
I stayed at Frito-Lay 12 years and rose to be a vice president for marketing. I felt it was time for a change, so when a recruiter called about Malt-O-Meal in 2001, I was intrigued. This is a family-owned, entrepreneurial company like the one my dad worked for, which is what I was looking for. I started as vice president for sales and marketing, was promoted to chief operating officer in 2004, and to C.E.O. in 2008.
We're challenging the legacy cereal brands. To compete, we have to keep our prices low for consumers and give retailers a good margin. It's a challenge. Everyone has to work shoulder to shoulder here. I played football and rugby in school, and I don't have a lot of patience for prima donnas. Companies are only as good as their people.
I like to say the office is a dangerous place from which to view the world. I often travel to stores with the other senior executives. That's where the customers are, and the senior team has to be there to understand them.
We discovered, in forgoing cereal boxes, that bags alone are more environmentally friendly. We made that decision to save money, but when we realized the benefit to the environment, it made us cast a wider net and look for other ways to be more sustainable.
Every summer, a friend and I take our teenage sons fishing for a week in the Canadian wilderness. An outfitter drops us off and we're on our own. The boys prepare the potatoes, and I clean and cook the fish we catch. Because I'm in the food business, I'm the cook.

HEADLINE: Why Taxes 'must' Climb

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In ''The Problem With 'No New Taxes' '' (Economic View, Oct. 2) Tyler Cowen said that ''taxes will eventually go up, because they must.'' But one explanation for that ''must'' is not often heard: Our nation went to war in Afghanistan and Iran without raising taxes to pay for that war. 
On the contrary, President George W. Bush cut taxes, thereby further postponing the payment. As conservatives like to say, ''There are no free lunches.'' So taxes must go up, not because of liberal profligacy or Keynesian theory, but simply because the time has come to pay the war bill.

HEADLINE: Vacuum Is Feared as U.S. Quits Iraq, but Iran's Deep Influence May Not Fill It

BYLINE: By TIM ARANGO; Duraid Adnan contributed reporting.

 BODY:
NAJAF, Iraq -- As the United States draws down its forces in Iraq, fears abound that Iran will simply move into the vacuum and extend its already substantial political influence more deeply through the soft powers of culture and commerce. But here, in this region that is a center of Shiite Islam, some officials say that Iran wore out its welcome long ago.
Surely, Iran has emerged empowered in Iraq over the last eight years, and it has a sympathetic Shiite-dominated government to show for it, as well as close ties to the anti-American cleric Moktada al-Sadr. But for what so far are rather obscure reasons -- perhaps the struggling Iranian economy and mistrust toward Iranians that has been nurtured for centuries -- it has been unable to extend its reach.
In fact, a host of countries led by Turkey -- but not including the United States -- have made the biggest inroads, much to the chagrin of people here in Najaf like the governor. 
''Before 2003, 90 percent of Najaf people liked Iranians,'' said the governor, Adnan al-Zurufi, who has lived in Chicago and Michigan and holds American citizenship. ''Now, 90 percent hate them. Iran likes to take, not give.''
Near midnight, Mr. Zurufi held court at a cafe, his team of bodyguards standing sentry at the door, frisking patrons. Outside, a convoy of white sport utility vehicles waited, and nearby, down a crooked alleyway, thousands of visitors took in the nighttime serenity of the Imam Ali Shrine, one of the holiest sites for the Shiite diaspora, where millions of Iranians flock every year.
Mr. Zurufi's comments cut against the grain of what is commonly understood about the influence of Iran in southern Iraq, where the two countries have a common religious bond -- both are majority Shiite -- but where nationality competes with sect.
A standard narrative has it that the Iraq war opened up a chessboard for the United States and Iran to tussle for power. One of the enduring outcomes has been an emboldened Iran that is politically close to Iraq's leaders, many of whom escaped to Iran during Saddam Hussein's government, and that is a large trading partner.
Yet the story is more nuanced, particularly in the Shiite-dominated south that became politically empowered after the American invasion upended Sunni rule. It has been other countries -- most powerfully Turkey, but also China, Lebanon and Kuwait -- that have cemented influence through economic ties.
The patterns were established soon after the American invasion. Shoddy Iranian goods -- particularly low-quality cheese, fruit and yogurt -- flooded markets in the south, often at exorbitant prices, said Mahdi Najat Nei, a diplomat who heads the Trade Promotion Organization of Iran office in Baghdad. This sullied Iran's reputation, even though prices have since plummeted, creating an aversion to Iranian goods that lasts to this day, Mr. Nei said.
This has made it difficult for Iranian businesspeople to make investments in southern Iraq, said Ali Rhida, who is from Iran and is building an iron factory on the outskirts of Najaf. ''The real problem is with the mangers of the economy in Iran,'' he said. ''After the fall of the regime, many Iranian companies came here but they screwed it all up.''
In Najaf, officials still complain of low-quality Iranian goods, as well as little real investment from their eastern neighbor and violence perpetrated by militias with links to Iran. Their main complaint about the Americans is their lack of influence.
One aim of the American invasion here was to establish a moderate center of Shiite Islam, democratically inclined and oriented to the West, that would be a counterbalance to Iran's system of clerical rule. However, something like the reverse seems to have happened. As Iran has used its political connections to hold great sway over Iraq's leadership class, and has backed militias responsible for assassinations and attacks on American bases, it has been less successful wielding other mechanisms of power at a grass-roots level.
''Investment from Iran has almost stopped,'' said Zuheir Sharba, the chairman of Najaf's provincial council, referring to a phenomenon that has more to do with Iran's anemic state-run economy than it does to Iranian ambitions. Speaking about Americans, he said, ''They were coming, but they've stopped.''
Mr. Sharba continued: ''We wish that American companies would come here. I wish the American relationship was that, instead of troops, it would be companies.'' Mr. Sharba is a cleric, and he spent 14 years in Iran in exile during Mr. Hussein's government.
With the United States military leaving, it will be left to diplomats, business executives and nongovernmental organizations to maintain American influence in Iraq. And while the State Department is embarking on a vast expansion of its operations, critics say it is missing an opportunity to secure influence here in the seat of Iraq's Shiite clerical establishment, which is an important power center in the new Iraq.
But winning over the clerics will not be easy. Certainly, some officials, including Mr. Zurufi -- who was appointed governor of Najaf in 2004 by L. Paul Bremer III, then the top American administrator in Iraq, and later elected to the post in 2009 -- are pro-American, but the clerical establishment, which is less receptive to American influence, wields more power over the people.
Not only did the Americans refuse a request by Mr. Zurufi and other officials to open a consulate in Najaf, the State Department's Provincial Reconstruction Team in Najaf actually shut down earlier than scheduled this summer after local clerical pressure, particularly from officials loyal to Mr. Sadr, who spends most of his time in Iran.
While Iran may be flagging in the battle for hearts and minds, it is still able to create trouble. A rise this summer in American troop deaths in southern Iraq at the hands of Iranian-backed militias raised alarms in diplomatic circles and became the core of the argument put forth by those who want a longer-lasting American military presence to counter Iran's clout.
But the troublemaking does not extend to the more important arena of commerce, officials say. ''Because of the political sensitivities of Iran, many people say Iran is controlling the economy of Iraq,'' said Sami al-Askari, a member of Parliament and a close confidant to Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki. ''No, the Turks are.''
Mr. Maliki once lived in Iran, and he surrounds himself with aides who have close ties to Tehran. Yet even these relationships have not translated into economic or cultural influence that could endear Iran to the Iraqi public at large. ''I've yet to meet an Iraqi who trusts the Iranians,'' said Joost Hiltermann, the International Crisis Group's deputy program director for the Middle East.
Mr. Hiltermann recalled a recent visit to Mr. Maliki's compound in Baghdad that illustrated for him the inability of Iran to transfer its political connections to durable economic power here. ''Maliki's aide was clearly resentful that the guesthouse was built by Turkey, but the Iranians couldn't do it,'' he said.
Iran has also been trying to make inroads culturally, but it is bumping up against the same uneasiness that Iraqis have toward Iran's business efforts. This year Iran negotiated a deal to refurbish several movie theaters in Baghdad that have been dark for years. Yet the renovations have yet to get under way, and officials say they wish it were the Americans -- and their technology -- involved in the project. ''If a person asks me, who do I want to come help me? I wish that the Americans, by occupying Iraq, would support the culture and theater,'' said Fuad Thanon, the head of Iraq's national theater.
Kenneth Katzman, a Middle East analyst at the Congressional Research Service in Washington, said that because of numerous small projects -- particularly related to religious tourism in Najaf, including a large underground toilet facility, and some construction projects in Basra -- ''a lot of these myths get perpetrated'' about Iran's influence in the south. ''In the aggregate, it doesn't add up to much,'' he said.

HEADLINE: No Coattail Effect In Gold's Surge

BYLINE: By CONRAD DE AENLLE

 BODY:
IF you bought a precious-metals fund at the start of this year because you expected stock market turbulence and thought gold would be a refuge, your foresight was impressive. Your returns? Not as much.
Gold rose 14.3 percent, to $1,624 an ounce, in the first nine months of the year, including 8.2 percent in the third quarter. The price has been underpinned by persistent doubts about the economic and financial health of the United States and Europe and the measures that governments and central banks might have to take to put things right.
Those concerns also sent stocks cascading around the world. These included stock in gold companies, despite the soaring price of their main product. The XAU, a widely followed index of gold and silver mining stocks, ended September with a loss of 18.4 percent for 2011, a far worse performance than metallic gold and even worse than the 10 percent loss for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. 
Some of the performance discrepancy between gold and mining stocks is justified by developments affecting the metal and the companies that produce it, analysts and fund managers say. Nevertheless, they expect the gap to narrow, although they disagree on whether gold will fall or mining stocks will rise -- or whether there will be some of both.
''When you buy any commodity equity, it's not the same as buying the commodity,'' Rebecca Patterson, chief market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, said to explain the divergence. ''You're going to have some correlation with the broader stock market. During the last couple of months, rather than hope for growth and a need for an inflation hedge, we have fear of a double dip. The stock portion of gold stocks is getting pulled down sharply. That doesn't mean it's a bad investment, just a different investment.''
Investors may buy mining stocks to get gold, but they also get businesses whose bottom lines are influenced by more than the price of what they sell.
''When you buy a company, you're getting access to other risks,'' said Nathan J. Rowader, manager of the Forward Commodity Long/Short Strategy fund. ''Investors are not valuing miners as highly as physical gold because of some of those risks.''
One risk he mentioned is geopolitical: much gold happens to be located in dangerous, unstable places.
There have also been unwelcome developments on the other side of corporate earnings statements. Ms. Patterson pointed out that mine operators have been facing rising expenses of all sorts.
''Power costs are rising. Labor costs are rising,'' she said. ''They're trying to increase production, but that means deeper mines and more costly mines to operate.''
Another reason for the comparatively weak showing of mining stocks, in her view, is the emergence of other vehicles for betting on gold, including exchange-traded funds that hold the physical metal. In the old days, investors who wanted to possess gold might buy coins or bars and lock them in a safe-deposit box.
Joung Park, a gold stock analyst at Morningstar, highlighted another shortcoming of mining companies that may have held back their stocks: gold in the ground is not the same as cash on the books.
''Obviously, a lot of the value for these miners is not created now, at current valuations,'' but later on, when gold prices may be lower, he said. ''Some investors don't think gold prices will stay at current levels forever.'' Mr. Park said he expected the metal to average $1,200 an ounce over the long haul.
He noted that many factors beyond widespread fear were supporting gold and could begin working to the advantage of mining companies. Interest rates are very low worldwide, which makes bonds and similar assets relatively less appealing alternatives. Consumers in emerging economies, often a source of robust demand for gold, are thriving. And energy costs have begun to moderate.
If these trends continued, ''we would see some of the underperformance reverse'' for mining stocks, Mr. Park predicted, and they would ''play catch-up.''
Not that he is expecting much of a boom. His favorite mining company is Yamana Gold, a Canadian company that he expects to show significant growth as new mines start to produce. Otherwise, he said, ''we think most of the miners that we cover are fairly valued.''
JOHN HATHAWAY, manager of the Tocqueville Gold fund, has much higher hopes for the sector. He sees the failure of mining stocks to keep pace with the metal as another opportunity to hop on the bandwagon -- one that he expects to keep rolling along.
''I don't agree with the cost argument because margins are the largest they've been in history,'' he said. Another factor in the lagging returns of mining stocks, he said, ''is fear that the gold price will come back substantially, but gold is different from all other commodities.'' He added: ''There's no substitute for gold when you have a monetary crisis. When oil goes up, it's because of a shortage or other macro factors, but when gold goes up, it's because people don't trust paper currency. What's going to make people start trusting paper currency?''
Mr. Hathaway says that gold stocks are appealing based on the same criteria that investors use to judge stocks in most industries, and that he thinks others will come around to his view. ''The generalist investor who has been burned in bank or retailing stocks, whatever, is going to look at this and think that these stocks trade at low multiples of earnings and cash flow and have high dividends compared with other stuff,'' he predicted.
He prefers companies with mines in politically stable countries or at least whose mines are well diversified geographically, including two Canadian producers, Goldcorp and Osisko, as well as Newmont Mining, based in Colorado.
The weakness in mining stocks may be offering investors ''a do-over,'' Mr. Hathaway said. ''If you missed the 50 percent rise in gold, you've got a second chance.''
Ms. Patterson, at J.P. Morgan, doesn't disagree, but she sees too many uncertainties for investors to bet too much on one gold play over the other.
''We want diversification, and I don't see that changing in the near future,'' she said. ''You want to own some commodities and some equities. If I were putting my own money to work right now, I would own both.''

HEADLINE: Banking and Futures Industry Protests Planned

BYLINE: By DON TERRY. 
dterry@chicagonewscoop.org

 BODY:
At an August training session for Action Now, an advocacy group for the poor, Madeline Talbott, the lead organizer, handed out a copy of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s ''Letter From Birmingham Jail,'' an impassioned plea for ''people of good will'' to join the fight for freedom and human rights.
''Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere,'' Dr. King wrote from his cell in 1963. 
Ms. Talbott asked the 45 people in the room to read aloud a passage from the letter and then asked if they were willing to follow Dr. King's call for nonviolent civil disobedience in the name of economic justice.
''Almost everyone raised their hand,'' she said. ''People are so fed up with the big banks and the foreclosure crisis and the do-nothing politicians. It seems like something is catching hold, and it really is different.''
On Monday, Action Now will join a coalition of 19 labor unions, low-income neighborhood organizations, teachers, students and other groups that is known collectively as Stand Up Chicago, which plans to demonstrate outside the Mortgage Bankers Association convention at the Hyatt Regency downtown and the Futures Industry Association meeting at the HiltonChicago on South Michigan Avenue. Organizers also expect at least 7,000 demonstrators to converge outside the Modern Wing of the Art Institute, where the mortgage bankers are scheduled to hold an evening reception.What impact the demonstrations will have remains to be seen. But it is clear that the youthful protests that began on Wall Street nearly a month ago have struck a chord with many financially struggling Americans and are spreading to cities across the country -- including Chicago, where a group called Occupy Chicago has camped outside the Federal Reserve building in the Loop.
''When there was a Chicago fire, the city leaders rebuilt the South and West Sides,'' Ms. Talbott said. ''We've been hit by a second Chicago fire, the foreclosure crisis, but none of the politicians have a plan to rebuild. We can't wait any longer. We have to act. We're losing whole neighborhoods.''
The coalition plans to protest both conferences with a weeklong series of marches, demonstrations, street theater and, as some vow, civil disobedience. Lawyers are being consulted and bail money rounded up.
Willie J. R. Fleming of the Chicago Anti-Eviction Campaign wants to be more than heard. Although his group does not belong to the coalition, members of the campaign are planning to join the protest.
''The banks have disrupted our lives,'' Mr. Fleming said. ''We have to disrupt their events and plans.''
Erik Gellman, a professor of history at Roosevelt University, who studies political and social movements like the campaign for civil rights in the 1950s and '60s, said: ''I think it's premature to predict whether this will develop into a mass movement. But what you see in Chicago and elsewhere is that people are empowering themselves and others and not waiting for particular heroes to come along and lead them.''
Spokesmen for the mortgage bankers and for the futures industry said they had no idea that their conferences would be targets of protests until a reporter from The Chicago News Cooperative called for comment.
''Like all Americans, I am proud to live in a country that embraces the right to freedom of speech,'' John Damgard, president of the Futures Industry Association, said in a written statement. ''We will treat the protesters with respect, and I expect they will do the same.''
The demonstrators occupying Wall Street and their Chicago counterparts occupying the corner of La Salle and Jackson have been criticized as being too vague in their demands. Stand Up Chicago has worked to avoid that assessment.
''We can't have 10 different issues,'' said Catherine Murrell, the coalition spokeswoman. ''We're trying to stay on message. The message is we are taking back our city, and we are taking back our wealth that has been distributed to corporations through tax cuts and bailouts''.
Ms. Murrell said the coalition was focusing on ''jobs, homes and schools'' and was calling for stronger legislation to maintain foreclosed properties and channel more money to schools through tax increment financing.
''Our ways of making a livelihood, the very homes we live in, our schools, have basically been taken away from us,'' she said. ''We want them back.''
On the eve of the protest, the coalition released a 27-page plan called ''Investing in Chicago Communities'' to create 40,000 jobs in the city and a 25-cent ''speculation fee'' to be paid by both buyers and sellers of derivative contracts, an investment vehicle. The coalition said the fee would generate nearly $1.4 billion a year.
Stand Up Chicago was pulled together in early 2011 and is housed in the West Loop offices of the Service Employees International Union, which has been a supporter of President Obama and other Democrats. Although the union helps support the coalition financially, Ms. Murrell said they were independent of each other.
Holly Krig, of the Jewish Council on Urban Affairs, which is planning a protest with priests, ministers and an imam during the bankers' conference, said, ''I think we've been betrayed by both political parties.''
Ms. Krig said her main concern was to ensure that after the week of protests, the members of the coalition continued ''the hard work of base building, and developing leadership, to sustain this as a struggle.''
''It's critical for us to work together,'' she said.
''We have to get beyond narrow issues and vague demands,'' Ms. Krig added. ''We need to really get at what the core issues are that are pushing the inequalities.''

HEADLINE: Clamping Down On Rapid Trades In Stock Market

BYLINE: By GRAHAM BOWLEY

 BODY:
Regulators in the United States and overseas are cracking down on computerized high-speed trading that crowds today's stock exchanges, worried that as it spreads around the globe it is making market swings worse.
The cost of these high-frequency traders, critics say, is the confidence of ordinary investors in the markets, and ultimately their belief in the fairness of the financial system.
''There is something unholy about them,'' said Guy P. Wyser-Pratte, a prominent longtime Wall Street trader and investor. ''That is what caused this tremendous volatility. They make a fortune whereas the public gets so whipsawed by this trading.''
Regulators are playing catch-up. In the United States and Europe, they have recently fined traders for using computers to gain advantage over slower investors by illegally manipulating prices, and they suspect other market abuse could be going on. Regulators are also weighing new rules for high-speed trading, with an international regulatory body to make recommendations in coming weeks. 
In addition, officials in Europe, Canada and the United States are considering imposing fees aimed at limiting trading volume or paying for the cost of greater oversight.
Perhaps regulators' biggest worry is over the unknown dynamics of the computerized stock market world that the firms are part of -- and the risk that at any moment it could spin out of control. Some regulators fear that the sudden market dive on May 6, 2010, when prices dropped by 700 points in minutes and recovered just as abruptly, was a warning of the potential problems to come. Just last week, the broader market fell throughout Tuesday's session before shooting up 4 percent in the last hour, raising questions on what was really behind it.
''The flash crash was a wake-up call for the market,'' said Andrew Haldane, executive director of the Bank of England responsible for financial stability. ''There are many questions begging.''
The industry and others say that the vast majority of trading is legitimate and that its presence means many extra buyers and sellers in the markets, drastically reducing trading costs for ordinary investors.
James Overdahl, an adviser to the firms' trade group, said that they favor policing the market to stamp out manipulation and that they support efforts to improve market stability. The traders, he said, ''are as much interested in improving the quality of markets as anyone else.''
Some academic studies show that high-frequency trading tends to reduce price volatility on normal trading days.
And while a recent analysis by The New York Times of price changes in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index over the past five decades showed that big price swings are more common than they used to be, analysts ascribe this to a variety of causes -- including high-speed electronic trading but also high anxiety about the European crisis and the United States economy.
''We are just beginning to catch up to the reality of, 'Hey, we are in an electronic market, what does that mean?' '' said Adam Sussman, director of research at the Tabb Group, a markets specialist.
High-frequency trading took off in the middle of the last decade when regulatory reforms encouraged exchanges to switch from floor-based trading to electronic. As computers took over, daily turnover of stocks rose to 8 billion shares in the United States from about 6 billion in 2007, according to BATS Global Markets.
The trading, done by independent firms or on special desks inside big Wall Street banks, now accounts for two of every three stock market trades in America.
Such trading has expanded into other markets, including futures markets in the United States. It has also spread to stock markets around the world where for-profit exchanges are taking steps to attract their business.
When British regulators noticed strange price movements in a range of shares on the London Stock Exchange, they tracked them to a Canadian firm issuing thousands of computerized orders allegedly designed to mislead other investors.
In August, regulators fined the firm, Swift Trade, $:8 million, or $13.1 million, for a technique called layering, which involves issuing and then canceling orders they never meant to carry out. The action was challenged by Swift Trade, which was dissolved last year.
Susanne Bergstrasser, a German regulator leading a review of high-speed trading for the International Organization of Securities Commissions, said authorities have to be alert for ''market abuse that may arise as a result of technological development.''
The organization will present its recommendations to G-20 finance ministers this month.
In the United States, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority last year fined Trillium Brokerage Services, a New York firm, and some of its employees $2.3 million for layering.
Even the traders' authorized activities are coming under fire, especially their tendency to shoot off thousands of orders a second and suddenly cancel many. Long-term investors like pension funds complain that the practice makes their trading harder.
Global regulators are considering penalizing traders if they issue but then cancel a high degree of orders, or even making them keep open their orders for a minimum time before they can cancel. Long-term investors worry that some traders may be using their superior technology to detect when others are buying and selling and rush in ahead of them to take advantage of price moves. This is driving some investors who buy and sell in large blocks to move to new so-called dark pools -- venues away from public exchanges. As more trading takes place in these venues, prices on exchanges have less meaning, critics say.
In the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission has been looking into the new market structure for almost two years. In July, it approved a ''large trader'' rule, requiring firms that do a lot of business, including high-speed traders, to offer more information about their activities in case regulators need to trace their trades.
After the flash crash, exchanges introduced circuit breakers to halt trading after violent moves. Bart Chilton, a commissioner at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, called for regulators to go further. He wants compulsory registration of high-frequency firms and pre-trade testing of their algorithms.
One of the most controversial actions has been the European Commission's recent proposal for a financial transaction tax on speculators, which would hit high-frequency firms and curtail volumes. The proposed tax would apply to all trades in stocks, bonds and derivatives, and may face stiff opposition from European governments. Many such firms are based in Britain or the Netherlands, and authorities fear a loss of business.
In Canada, a top regulator is proposing higher fees on the biggest players. Last year, the country put in place a monitoring system to track the 200 million to 250 million orders its exchanges receive daily -- up from 70 million a year and a half ago.
And the S.E.C. last year proposed what would be an even more high-powered monitoring system called a consolidated audit trail that would gather data on trades in real time from all United States exchanges, and be a powerful tool in helping regulators piece together events in case of another flash crash.
The monitoring ''will provide regulators a critical new tool to surveil the securities markets and pursue wrongdoers, in a much more efficient and effective way than we can today,'' said David Shillman, associate director of the S.E.C.'s trading and markets unit.

HEADLINE: High Corporate Profits May Reduce Risk in High-Yield Bonds

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.

 BODY:
AT a time of ridiculously low interest rates, some income-starved investors have been drawn to high-yield bonds, a risky but often misunderstood asset class that can add a bit of stability as well as punch to a portfolio.
High-yield -- often called junk -- bonds paid about 8.34 percentage points more than United States Treasury issues of comparable maturity, on average, on Sept. 30. Although that is well under the double-digit point premiums that prevailed at market bottoms during the last decade, specialists say that this may still be a profitable time to consider high-yield mutual funds, which are particularly appropriate for tax-sheltered accounts.
''I think the market is attractive,'' said William J. Morgan, senior high-yield portfolio manager for J. P. Morgan Asset Management. Junk bonds were trading as if almost 9 percent of issues will default over the coming year, Mr. Morgan observed, even as Moody's Investors Service projects that only 1 percent to 2 percent will do so.
''I see high-yield as offering pretty decent value here,'' agreed Matt Eagan, co-manager of the Loomis Sayles Bond fund, which invests up to 35 percent of assets in lower-rated securities. 
Mr. Eagan noted that despite weak economic growth, American companies are enjoying hefty profits, indicating that they cannot only handle interest and principal payments on their bonds but also can take advantage of today's low interest rates should they need to refinance.
''The default rate is likely to remain low,'' he said, and is quite unlikely to rise much above 5 percent even if the economy skids back into recession. Default rates peaked at more than 10 percent after the 2008 meltdown, in the early 2000s and in the early 1990s.
Investors who cringe at the idea of buying low-quality debt -- the BBB rating is generally considered the border with investment-grade bonds -- should recognize that it can act as a kind of stabilizing portfolio ballast, some specialists maintain.
''A certain mix of higher-quality and high-yield bonds lowers volatility while boosting and smoothing returns,'' Mr. Morgan said.
Major companies, not just start-ups or fringe telecoms, are now among the biggest issuers of high-yield -- the likes of Ford Motor Credit, the CIT Group, the Hospital Corporation of America, Ally Bank and Sprint Nextel.
Still, the market for high-yield bonds is highly volatile and subject to periodic bouts of illiquidity like the one that occurred in August. That is when the fund category, which had been posting double-digit returns during the preceding 12 months, suffered its biggest monthly loss -- 4.37 percent -- since 2008, according to Morningstar. (The high-yield market had a lesser skid in the second half of September.)
PRICES slumped after Standard & Poor's, citing the political stalemate after a rancorous Congressional debt-ceiling debate, cut the United States' credit rating. High-yield investors are very attuned to talk of defaults, but the market also suffered from the European financial turmoil and even the effects of the Japanese tsunami.
''The market had a mass anxiety attack, as all risk assets did,'' said Mark Vaselkiv, manager of the T. Rowe Price High Yield fund.
The performance of high-yield bonds, unlike that of investment-grade issues, is very sensitive to the stock market and the economy. Good times indicate that borrowers have a greater ability to service debt, which is far more important to high-yield buyers than the rising interest rates that typically accompany faster growth and that depress the prices of better-quality bonds.
The risk of rising rates, in fact, is limited for high-yield bonds because they almost always come due in 5 to 10 years, compared with 30 years or more for most other corporate bonds. Moreover, their high interest rates provide a cushion against falling prices in a rate upswing. ''High-yield will outperform when interest rates go up,'' Mr. Morgan said.
Many specialists say the only sensible way for ordinary investors to buy high-yield debt is through mutual funds -- both to obtain essential diversification and to avoid being victimized by wide gaps between buying and selling prices in a market that may have relatively little activity.
Retail investors in individual bonds are taking big risks, partly because of the likelihood of unfavorable execution of orders, Mr. Vaselkiv said.
Jeff Tjornehoj, a senior research analyst at Lipper, said that one excellent fund was Fidelity Capital and Income, because of consistent long-term performance, tax efficiency and annual expenses of a reasonable 0.76 percent. It returned 7 percent, annualized, in the five years through Sept. 30 but lost 10.8 percent in the quarter, according to Morningstar. Some 43 percent of its portfolio is in bonds rated B, and 12 percent are rated CCC or below; 17 percent of the fund is invested in stocks.
He said the Vanguard High-Yield Corporate fund has been a high-quality ''middle of the road'' performer with a portfolio averaging a B rating. It returned 3.7 percent in the quarter , while charging just 0.25 percent in expenses, according to Morningstar.
But there is substantial variation among the more than 500 high-yield funds, with some embracing bonds rated CCC or even lower, as well as common and preferred stocks, convertibles or even derivatives.
The unwary may find the junk market downright treacherous, Mr. Tjornehoj cautioned. ''The investor must accept greater volatility and a real risk of loss,'' he said, pointing to the Oppenheimer Champion Income fund, which lost about four-fifths of its value in 2008 because of heavy losses on credit default swaps and mortgage-backed securities.
Potential buyers should at least check a fund's portfolio to make sure it isn't committed to more low-quality risk than they want and isn't overly concentrated in certain industries. Good credit analysis by fund managers should uncover issues that are candidates for a ratings upgrade.
Zane E. Brown, a fixed-income strategist at Lord Abbett, noted that gambling, leisure and automotive companies are frequent high-yield borrowers, which could lead to unbalanced fund portfolios if such companies are overrepresented. He now frowns on the bonds of home builders and companies in the paper, publishing and printing industries because, he says, their prospects are generally poor.
While defaults are the biggest hazard in the junk market, analysts also try to predict how much can be salvaged when they occur. The average recovery has run at 44 percent, Mr. Morgan said.
ALTHOUGH many high-yield managers include a wide variety of securities in their portfolios, Mr. Brown sticks closely to corporate bonds. He avoids foreign government bonds because they are harder to analyze and are subject to sudden political change.
Investors should beware of funds offering the very highest current returns, experts also said. Not only might their holdings be of very low quality, but the managers may be paying premium prices, thereby returning some principal in the guise of interest, Mr. Eagan said.
With these cautions, high-yield may be appealing these days -- though not the screaming bargain it proved to be when market liquidity evaporated in 2008. But Mr. Vaselkiv issued a caveat: This market may be good ''as long as we don't go into a double-dip recession,'' he said. ''It's really a bet on the U.S. economy.''

HEADLINE: For Domestic Workers, Vast Global Labor Pool Challenges Treaty's Aim

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- When governments from around the globe passed a treaty in June to protect domestic workers, labor experts called it a surprising breakthrough for millions of exploited women.
Even countries that fail to ratify the pact will eventually be judged by its standards, they said, and the campaign to pass it had enlisted fresh allies, newly mindful of abuses from unpaid wages to rape.
Two days later, Saudi Arabia, a major destination for domestic workers, beheaded an Indonesian maid -- at once highlighting the need for protections and the challenges of putting them in place.
The execution followed reports from maids who said their Saudi bosses had burned or beaten them, and the condemned woman, who killed her employer, said she had been abused. But when the Indonesian president protested, the Saudis stopped hiring Indonesians and pointedly turned to cheaper workers from countries less likely to complain. 
The twin developments -- accord in Geneva and maid wars in Riyadh -- show opposing forces in a global campaign to protect domestic workers, an overlooked group of as many as 100 million people.
More broadly, that campaign tests the effort to raise work standards in a world of cheap and mobile labor. Many domestic workers are migrants, and the precedents could shape the treatment of other migrant groups. On Sept. 30, for example, Hong Kong's High Court struck down a law that had excluded domestic workers from the residency rights offered to other foreign citizens, potentially allowing 100,000 maids to gain the right to stay.
The events show that ''officials have not forgotten about migrant workers,'' said Philip Martin, an economist at the University of California, Davis. ''But they are also a reminder of the difficulties of extending effective protections to them.''
''The receiving countries can always say, 'We will get workers somewhere else,' '' he said.
While acknowledging such challenges, the treaty's supporters say that it establishes vital new principles and that it will accelerate changes already under way. Before the pact was approved, Singapore, Jordan and New York State had passed new laws, and proposals are being considered in places as different as California and Kuwait. Even Saudi Arabia, a source of frequent abuse complaints, is considering changes that officials may feel more inclined to accept after voting for the pact.
''The treaty was a watershed event,'' said Nisha Varia, a researcher at Human Rights Watch. ''There is now a global consensus that these women deserve the same rights as other workers. All the governments involved in this conversation will be under pressure to examine their labor laws.''
As a labor force composed mostly of women who work behind closed doors, domestic workers are hard to organize and vulnerable to attack. Many countries exclude them from labor laws, leaving no legal boundaries on their hours or pay.
In the United States, domestic workers are covered by minimum-wage laws, but they are excluded from federal statutes on occupational health, overtime and the right to organize.
As long ago as 1965, the International Labor Organization, a branch of the United Nations, saw an ''urgent need'' to protect domestic workers, whom it called ''singularly subject to exploitation.'' But interest in formal action waned, and women flooded the workplace, making nannies and maids a cornerstone of modern economies.
The export of domestic workers became big business in migration hubs like Indonesia and the Philippines, where more than half the migrants are women. Both countries celebrate the sums the women send home and simmer at the stories of mistreatment that percolate in the news media.
Saudi Arabia is a prime destination for both countries. In 2008, a study by Ms. Varia cited dozens of cases that amounted ''to forced labor, trafficking, or slavery-like conditions.'' While abuses occur everywhere, the report said, Saudi Arabia prosecuted few cases and sometimes allowed bosses to pursue retaliatory charges, like theft, against victims who complained.
A spokesman for the Saudi Arabian Embassy in Washington declined to comment. In the past, Saudi officials have accused critics of exaggerating isolated cases of abuse, and noted that legions of women still seek the jobs.
When the international labor group turned to domestic workers in 2010, Persian Gulf states, speaking as a bloc, called for nonbinding recommendations. In a reversal this year, they supported a binding treaty.
What is more, they strengthened it, with calls for stronger language on contract rights, overtime pay and access to courts during employer conflicts.
''It really made an impression,'' said Ellene Sana of the Center for Migrant Advocacy in Manila. ''When you think of abuses, you think of the gulf -- yet here they are, standing up for domestic workers.''
Pressure from the Arab Spring, Ms. Sana said, may help explain the change. Others note that the rotating leadership of the bloc passed to the United Arab Emirates, which is conscious of the region's global reputation.
Of the 128 governments that voted, only Swaziland opposed the pact, which says domestic workers should enjoy rights equivalent to those given to other workers in the same country, including limited workweeks, overtime pay and paid vacations.
While the United States pushed hard for the pact, the Senate rarely approves labor treaties that would require changes in federal law, as this one would if ratified. Legally the pact applies only in countries that ratify it, but its uses as a yardstick may be broader.
Even as support for the treaty grew, so did reports of abuse in Saudi Arabia. Keni binti Carda, an Indonesian maid, went home in 2008 with scars spread across her back and face. She said her employer burned her with an iron and forced her to eat excrement.
A Sri Lankan maid, L. D. Ariyawathie, arrived home last year with two dozen nails in her body -- hammered there, she said, by her employer.
After an Indonesian woman, Sumiati binti Salan Mustapa, was hospitalized in Medina last year with broken bones and a mutilated face, the Indonesian president, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, condemned her ''extraordinary torture.'' But the conviction of her employer was overturned.
On June 18, two days after the Geneva vote, Saudi Arabia beheaded an Indonesian named Ruyati binti Sapubi. Mr. Yudhoyono denounced Saudi ''norms and manners,'' and the Saudis stopped admitting new Indonesian maids.
They had already placed a similar ban on the Philippines, after several Philippine lawmakers visited in January and wrote they were ''shocked into speechlessness by the tales of rape and abuse.'' Saudi recruiters then described plans to hire thousands of Bangladeshis at wages of $170 a month, less than half what the Philippine government demanded.
More battles may be pending. Under a new law, the Philippine government must identify which countries are acceptable destinations for domestic workers, which could prompt more conflicts like the one with the Saudis.
Still, Philippine officials say the treaty, by laying out common principles, has given them a new weapon in an old fight.
It is ''a landmark accomplishment,'' said Carlos Cao Jr., who runs the Philippine government's overseas work program. ''But you don't change cultures overnight.''

HEADLINE: Deer in the Headlights, Financially Speaking

BYLINE: By RICHARD H. THALER. 
Richard H. Thaler is a professor of economics and behavioral science at the Booth School of Business at the University of Chicago.

 BODY:
BY any measure, the global economy is facing unusually high levels of uncertainty and volatility. But human nature may be impeding our ability to turn the economy around.
Fear and anxiety don't bring out the best in anyone. When normally loving spouses are lost in traffic and late for a flight, their conversation is rarely suitable for young ears, even when the children are in the back seat.
Along with making people irritable, uncertainty can create paralysis. Some animals freeze when they are frightened. Acting like a deer in the headlights can be a good strategy if you are trying not to be seen, but it can get you run over. 
In humans, this behavior is illustrated by an experiment conducted by the Princeton psychologist Eldar Shafir. The subjects, who were graduate students, were told about an attractive deal for a spring-break vacation. They could get an especially good price if they bought their tickets now, rather than waiting a week. But, as part of the deal, the students wouldn't hear the results of an important exam until the discount expired. That uncertainty caused many students to freeze: Although a majority said they intended to take the trip whether or not they passed the exam -- either to celebrate their success or recover from failure -- they didn't want to buy the tickets until they found out the results.
I worry that many Americans are now acting like Professor Shafir's subjects. They know that there are investments they should be making, investments that are currently ''on sale,'' but they are waiting to see how things shape up before they act.
Congress certainly suffers from this problem. The country has a long list of roads and bridges that are either dangerous or obsolete. We can begin the inevitable process of rebuilding this infrastructure now, when construction costs are low and borrowing costs are essentially zero, or we can wait.
But why wait? Postponing will only make the projects cost more when we finally get around to starting them, and, in the meantime, we risk disaster if one of those bridges fails. Do we think we will no longer need bridges? If Greece defaults, American cars will not suddenly become amphibious.
Congress is not the only place where we can see paralysis. Corporations are hoarding cash at record rates. The Federal Reserve recently reported that nonfinancial companies in the United States were holding more than $2 trillion in cash and other liquid assets -- money that is earning next to nothing. A considerable amount of that cash has been accumulated in the last two years -- and the totals exclude the substantial sums the companies hold abroad in foreign subsidiaries. Of course, it can be sensible for businesses to have a source of emergency cash, but many appear to be stockpiling so much that it's hard to imagine what emergency they fear. To cite just one example, Google is holding more than $39 billion in cash.
Google is far from alone. A recent survey of chief financial officers by Duke University reports that 55 percent of them say they won't begin to deploy cash holdings in the next year. Many say they are waiting for economic uncertainty to decline.
Yet is such caution rational? As a shareholder, I would worry about a company that says it can't find investments that can reasonably be expected to earn well above the tiny return of its cash.
Investment does not necessarily have to involve increasing capacity. Are there no plants or equipment that need upgrading? No promising research-and-development opportunities to be explored? Not even any parking lots that need to be repaved and painted?
I also do not buy the idea that companies need all this cash for acquisitions. If they really want to buy another business, they can issue stock to do so.
Loosening the purse strings just a little could have big effects on the economy. Suppose that American companies reduced their domestic cash holdings by just 10 percent and invested that $200 billion in productive investments. Using standard assumptions, these investments would spur growth in gross domestic product next year by about 1.3 percent and reduce unemployment by almost 0.7 percent. These investments would also increase tax revenue and generate long-term profits.
Some people contend that uncertainty about government regulation is making businesses cautious, but no solid evidence supports this claim. Corporations always complain about regulators, but the fact is that corporate profits are strong in many sectors. Those piles of cash didn't come out of thin air.
SOME households are also displaying fearful investment behavior. I'm not referring to those that are struggling with debt and unemployment, but to the segments of our society whose finances have rebounded nicely. These folks are investing in United States Treasuries and money market accounts in record numbers.
If you are among these more fortunate households, you may also be passing up attractive investment opportunities that will earn much more than the 0.01 percent you're getting from your money market account.
One such opportunity lies in making improvements to your home -- assuming, of course, that you aren't underwater on your mortgage. As a starting point, analyze ways to make your home more energy-efficient. Investing in insulation, windows, heating and air-conditioning and even solar collectors often provides excellent and highly predictable rates of return. Not only will you eventually make money, but you can pat yourself on the back with both hands since you'll be helping to restart the economy while helping the environment.
Some homeowners are already embracing this idea: one of the economy's few encouraging signs is that residential remodeling permits were recently up 24 percent over the previous
year.
Sure, there is much to worry about these days. But freezing in place is seldom the right strategy. Personally, I am planning to hire someone to repaint my apartment. What about you? Maybe some new gutters?

HEADLINE: Universe Is Expanding, But Where Do I Park?

BYLINE: By ZUSHA ELINSON. 
zelinson@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
After winning a Nobel Prize on Tuesday, Saul Perlmutter, a physics professor at the University of California, Berkeley, gave an energetic talk about his discovery that the universe is expanding at an accelerating pace to a roomful of admirers and journalists. 
At the end of his address, Mr. Perlmutter, who shared the Nobel Prize with Adam Riess and Brian Schmidt, was asked about another distinction that comes with the prize: one of the very few permanently reserved and free parking spaces on the university's busy campus.
''Probably the single most important thing about the Nobel Prize for most people is whether they get the coveted parking space on campus,'' Mr. Perlmutter said.
The crowd erupted in howls of laughter as Chancellor Robert Birgenau leapt onto the stage and handed Mr. Perlmutter his golden Nobel laureate parking pass.
''Now, it's all been worthwhile,'' Mr. Perlmutter said.
He was joking -- sort of.
The spots are the envy of all. Not even the chancellor gets a parking space that is free or reserved for life.
Parking is hard to find on the downtown Berkeley campus. The university has nearly 50,000 students, faculty and staff members at any given time, and only about 7,000 parking spaces to go around.
Parking permits have been wryly called ''hunting licenses'' because students and faculty members must often search at length for an available space, most of which are unassigned.
''If you come early enough in the morning, you can find a parking space,'' said Robert Littlejohn, another physics professor. ''But if you come after 10 or 11 o'clock, you might not find one at all.''
Mr. Littlejohn said he gave up driving to campus years ago. Instead, he rides a bicycle, in part, he said, to avoid the ''parking hassles'' and the cost of a faculty permit on central campus, nearly $1,500 a year.
The university already has seven reserved parking spaces for its living Nobel laureates, and will soon add the one for Mr. Perlmutter. (Steven Chu, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1997, relinquished his space when he joined the Obama administration as energy secretary.)
The parking spaces are next to the buildings where the winners work. Large blue signs reading ''Reserved for NL'' or ''Reserved for Nobel Laureate at All Times'' mark the spots, as do white painted letters on the concrete.
University tour guides always point out the signs to impress prospective students. After Daniel McFadden won the Nobel in economic science in 2000, the enormous crowd at a Cal football game gave him a standing ovation. When a Los Angeles Times reporter asked which was better, the cheers from 50,000 fans or the parking space, Mr. McFadden said that the space was ''considered slightly more important than the prize itself.''
Mr. Perlmutter's 1998 discovery, which overturned the conventional notion that the universe's expansion was slowing, was 10 years in the making. His colleagues characterized him as patient, persistent and exacting to the point of slowness.
But on Wednesday, Mr. Perlmutter, 52, was quick to put his new privilege to use: he was spotted parking outside Le Conte Hall for an afternoon event in his honor in one of the existing ''Reserved for NL'' spots.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Anti-Federalism Aims at Education

BYLINE: By TRIP GABRIEL

 BODY:
Representative Michele Bachmann promises to ''turn out the lights'' at the federal Education Department. Gov. Rick Perry calls it unconstitutional. Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker, would allow it to live but only as a drastically shrunken agency that mainly gathers statistics.
Even Mitt Romney, who in 2008 ran for president defending No Child Left Behind, the federal law that vastly expanded Washington's role in public schools, now says, ''We need to get the federal government out of education.''
For a generation, there has been loose bipartisan agreement in Washington that the federal government has a necessary role to play in the nation's 13,600 school districts, primarily by using money to compel states to raise standards.
But the field of Republican presidential candidates has promised to unwind this legacy, arguing that education responsibilities should devolve to states and local districts, which will do a better job than Washington. 
It can seem like an eon has passed since George W. Bush aspired to be the ''education president.'' Mr. Bush's prized No Child Left Behind law used billions of dollars of federal aid to compel schools to raise student achievement on standardized tests.
President Obama's own signature education initiative, Race to the Top, similarly used federal money to leverage change that many Republicans had long endorsed -- charter schools and teacher evaluations that tied effectiveness in the classroom to tenure.
But now, the quest to sharply shrink government that all the Republican candidates embrace, driven by the fervor of the Tea Party, has brought a sweeping anti-federalism to the fore on education, as in many other areas.
The question is whether states and local districts, without Washington's various carrots and sticks, will continue to raise academic standards and give equal opportunity to traditionally ignored student populations.
''People want government money, they want higher standards, they want greater accountability,'' said Chester E. Finn Jr., president of the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, a conservative-leaning education policy group, who was an education official in the Reagan administration. ''None of those things in most places comes from local control.''
So far, the candidates have not been specific about what a drastically reduced federal role would look like. Education has not become a major issue, and when candidates do address it, they tend to paint the Education Department with the same broad brush used to criticize Mr. Obama for what they see as government overreach on health care, Wall Street reform and the environment.
Tom Luna, the elected superintendent of schools in Idaho, said Washington's oversight of education is different from health care or environmental regulations. The Education Department dispenses a large share of its billions of dollars to states and local districts on the condition that they uphold two pillars of national law -- that students who are economically disadvantaged and students who are disabled get extra classroom enrichment.
''If you're a conservative Republican like I consider myself,'' said Mr. Luna, who is also president-elect of the Council of Chief State School Officers, ''there has to be accountability for how those dollars are spent. We can't send them to schools or states with no accountability.''
The change in Republican perspective is most noticeable with Mr. Romney and Mr. Perry, who earlier in their political careers supported No Child Left Behind. That 2002 law required states to show yearly progress in the number of students who were proficient in English and math, although it allowed states to measure proficiency in their own ways. Mr. Perry participated in a news conference heralding federal officials' approval of the Texas plan for putting the law in place, providing $400 million for the state.
But today he complains of ''unfunded mandates'' in federal education laws that require Texas, he says, to spend more to meet the rules than it receives in federal dollars. He was one of four governors who refused to compete in Race to the Top, a grant contest that he called ''a federal takeover of public schools.''
Margaret Spellings, the education secretary in the latter years of the Bush administration, said that before No Child Left Behind, when federal laws had few strings attached, many states showed little progress raising student achievement, especially for poor and minority students. ''We tried that for 40 years,'' she said. ''The results were far from stellar.''
For his part, Mr. Romney, as governor of Massachusetts, which has long had the nation's top public schools, at first resisted the education law, but he came to embrace it. More recently, he has praised Mr. Obama's education secretary, Arne Duncan, for promoting ''school choice'' and tying teacher evaluations to student test scores.
But Mr. Romney is clearly feeling the hot breath of Tea Party anti-federalism. In a debate last month, when Mr. Perry accused him of being a Race to the Top fan, Mr. Romney responded, ''I don't support any particular program that he's describing.'' In fact, Mr. Romney had praised Race to the Top the day before.
Closing the Education Department has long been a talking point of some Republicans, though it was ignored in practice. As a presidential candidate, Ronald Reagan campaigned to close it in 1980, the year it was created. But he found no Congressional takers and, as president, ended up expanding its budget and ambitions.
It is unclear whether the current field of candidates favors not just shrinking a Washington bureaucracy, but also eliminating the department's entire $68 billion budget. Most funds support broadly popular programs: classroom enrichment for poor students, local aid for students with disabilities and Pell grants for low-income college students, often the first in their families to go to college.
Presumably not many of the Republican candidates want to zero out all this money. One who appears to is Mrs. Bachmann, who promises ''the mother of all repeal bills'' to undo education laws dating from the Great Society.
''Over a three-year period,'' she explained in August at a rally in South Carolina, ''I'd take the money we send to schools and write to superintendents, 'No more requirements you have to deal with, but over three years you won't have any money.' ''
For now, conservative crowds are applauding.
But that argument risks rattling independent and suburban voters in the general election, when Mr. Obama is sure to champion a strong federal role in lifting student achievement and ensuring fairness.
''You can imagine,'' said Frederick M. Hess, director of education policy at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, ''the Republican candidate is saying, 'Not only do I want to end the Education Department as a bureaucratic monster, but I want to defund programs for needy kids or special-needs kids,' or 'I want to let states spend those dollars on other kids.' That's a very difficult debate for the Republican candidate.''

HEADLINE: Once Again, Social Issues Test Romney

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR, ERIK ECKHOLM and ASHLEY PARKER; Kitty Bennett and Jeff Zeleny contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- After years of trying to tamp down concerns about his stance on social issues and his Mormon faith, Mitt Romney is now being forced to fend off revived questions from rivals and evangelical leaders about the consistency and depth of his conservatism.
Mr. Romney has tried at every stage of the race for the Republican presidential nomination to focus on the economy, and he did so again on Saturday, when he appeared here at the Values Voter Summit, a gathering of social conservative activists.
But he also felt compelled to reiterate that he was in sync with social conservatives as he ran through his positions on abortion, marriage, judicial appointments and religious values. And as other speakers condemned homosexuality and raised questions about whether a Mormon is a true Christian, Mr. Romney emphasized that tolerance and civility were conservative values.
''The task before us is to focus on the conservative beliefs and the values that unite us,'' he said. ''Let no agenda narrow our vision or drive us apart.'' 
The questions he faces about his rightward shift over the years on the topics of most concern to social conservatives have become entangled in Mr. Romney's broader challenge: establishing himself as authentic and principled, and battling the perception that he has reshaped himself for the politics of the moment.
With Mr. Romney having regained the perceived status of front-runner, his opponents have signaled that they will go after him hard from the right, questioning his conservative credentials and trying to force him off his economic message. He now has to parry those intensifying attacks without giving up the opportunity to win over independent voters should he become his party's nominee and face President Obama next year.
Gov. Rick Perry of Texas urged Republican voters in Iowa on Saturday to study the records of the candidates to find an ''authentic and conservative leader.'' There was little question that Mr. Romney was the subject of his remarks.
''You measure a leader by how they walk, not how they talk,'' Mr. Perry said. ''I've got a conservative record. I'm proud of that conservative record.''
Beyond Mr. Romney's substantive positions, his faith is re-emerging as a concern among some evangelicals. On Saturday, a conservative activist speaking after Mr. Romney, Bryan Fischer, said without naming Mr. Romney that the next president had to be a man of ''genuine'' Christian faith. On Friday, a backer of Mr. Perry described Mr. Romney's faith as a cult.
Mr. Perry later said he disagreed with that characterization, and some evangelical leaders said they were less concerned about Mr. Romney's being a Mormon than about his stand on the issues.
Mr. Romney's address on Saturday got a positive reception from many in the audience.
''Now the foundation needed for a strong economy and a strong military is a people of strong values,'' Mr. Romney said, going on to promise that he would eliminate federal funding for Planned Parenthood and appoint judges who would vote to roll back Roe v. Wade.
In his 2008 race, Mr. Romney and his team reached out regularly to social conservatives. He once even sent evangelical leaders expensive wooden chairs with brass plaques promising a seat at ''our table.''
Advisers said the campaign's approach in 2012 was based on a belief that conservative voters and religious leaders know far more about Mr. Romney's views than they did four years ago. They noted that Mr. Romney had attended the Values Voter Summit conference every year. They said that there were no plans for him to give another speech about his Mormon faith but that he would continue to address social issues as they were raised.
Mr. Romney is also determined to keep his focus on the economic struggles of voters, believing that is Mr. Obama's biggest vulnerability. Some social conservative leaders say evangelical voters will mobilize behind any Republican nominee, including Mr. Romney, just because they are so united in their desire to defeat Mr. Obama.
Still, Mr. Romney clearly has not quelled all the doubts about him among social conservatives because of his positions over the years both on social issues and the health care legislation he signed as governor of Massachusetts, which has many similarities to the national legislation signed by Mr. Obama.
''He did a good job and hit all the issues,'' Mathew D. Staver, the dean of the Liberty University School of Law, said after Mr. Romney's speech Saturday. ''It did not change my opinion, however. He needs to renounce RomneyCare and not defend it or distinguish it from ObamaCare.''
Richard Land, the head of the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention, said before the speech that evangelicals felt ''some reluctance'' about Mr. Romney. They wonder ''how strongly he feels about their issues.''
But Mr. Land added that ''most evangelicals and social conservatives don't think the country can survive four more years of Barack Obama.''
Ralph Reed, the director of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, said Mr. Romney's strategy might work to his advantage.
''My sense is that his strategy this time is not to genuflect or pander,'' Mr. Reed said. ''Romney has retooled to some extent and is running as someone who knows how to turn around the economy and create jobs. That's not necessarily a mistake.''
Mr. Romney's evolution on the issues has been well documented. On abortion, he once called himself ''pro-choice'' and supported Planned Parenthood. But after being elected governor of Massachusetts, he publicly switched his position, declaring that the debate over stem cell research had convinced him of the ''sanctity of life.'' Since then, Mr. Romney has called himself ''pro-life.''
As a candidate for a Massachusetts seat in the Senate, Mr. Romney wrote a letter in 1994 arguing that ''we must make equality for gays and lesbians a mainstream concern.'' The letter, to the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay advocacy group, said he would do more for gay rights than Senator Edward M. Kennedy, his Democratic opponent.
Since then, however, Mr. Romney has fought against gay rights, championing an amendment to the Massachusetts Constitution that would ban same-sex marriage. As a presidential candidate, he has opposed same-sex marriage and this summer signed a pledge to support a federal constitutional amendment that would define marriage as between one man and one woman.
On gun rights, Mr. Romney once defended the tough laws in Massachusetts, promising not to ''chip away'' at them. But more recently, he has stuck to the line favored by the National Rifle Association, proclaiming his unqualified support for the Second Amendment and saying government needs to enforce existing gun laws, not create new ones.
Now, when asked on the campaign trail if he has flip-flopped, Mr. Romney points to his book ''No Apology,'' which lays out his positions on the issues, and quickly moves on.
''It's not that every single issue I looked at in my entire life I've never changed my view on,'' Mr. Romney said at a recent town-hall-style meeting in New Hampshire. ''In the private sector, if you don't change your view when the facts change, well, you'll get fired -- for being stubborn and stupid. So I'm very happy with where I am and the things I believe.''

HEADLINE: In Iowa, Pressure on Perry Over Immigration

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY

 BODY:
ORANGE CITY, Iowa - Gov. Rick Perry of Texas said Saturday that he would offer a detailed plan for job creation next week in the first policy speech of his presidential candidacy. But during a weekend visit here, he spent much of the time focusing on another issue: immigration.
-In three stops across northwestern Iowa, the state's most conservative region, Mr. Perry delivered a forceful recitation of the steps he had taken in Texas to enforce immigration laws. He reminded audiences that he vetoed legislation granting driver's licenses to illegal immigrants and he signed a law requiring voters to show identification. 
''Legal votes should not be canceled out by illegal ones,'' Mr. Perry said.
Yet at every event, voters did little to mask their skepticism. They pointedly asked him to explain the Texas law that allows illegal immigrants to qualify for in-state tuition rates at public colleges and universities.
He neither repeated nor recanted a remark he made last month when he suggested Republicans were heartless for opposing the idea. But he sought to allay their concerns about a topic that has threatened to overshadow his economic message and the job-creation record in Texas that he had hoped to promote as the centerpiece of his candidacy.
''They dumped it on the states,'' Mr. Perry said. ''Are we going to kick these people to the side of the road and let them become tax wasters? Or are we going to give them the opportunity to go to an institution of higher learning, pay full in-state tuition, which we do, and require them pursue citizenship? The issue was really driven by economics.''
He did not raise the in-state tuition issue on his own. But when he was asked about it, he sought to explain it in a measured way and frame it as an economic argument. His irritation was clear, though, when he encountered a face-to-face question after his speech from a woman who demanded to know why illegal immigrants were given preferential treatment.
The woman, Fae Groff-Moritz, a 63-year-old medical records clerk, approached Mr. Perry and asked why one of her children had to pay out-of-state tuition in neighboring South Dakota when illegal immigrants in Texas receive in-state tuition.
''It sounds like a pretty free ride,'' she said.
''It's not,'' he replied. ''I don't know where you're hearing it. It's not a free ride.''
Mr. Perry acknowledged that he has struggled to explain the issue, saying, ''Sometimes in a one-minute sound bite, it's hard to get all of that in, but the key is this: because of the failure of the federal government to deal with the border, we have to deal with it.''
He added: ''If other states don't want to do that, that's their call, I respect that. It's not a federal issue. As the president of the United States, I wouldn't allow it to be a federal issue.''
The issue has been stoked here in Iowa, whose caucuses will open the 2012 nominating contest, by his leading Republican rival, Mitt Romney. On the eve of Mr. Perry's arrival, the Romney campaign released a flier saying that the in-state tuition benefit amounted to a break of $70,000 a student.
Mr. Perry rejected that argument again and again as he addressed enthusiastic crowds in Sioux City, Orange City and Spencer. Several voters said in interviews that his position was not necessarily a deal-breaker and that they were pleased by fuller explanation.
''Texas is a country of its own,'' said Kathryn Parsons, 88, who rose from her seat to ask one of the most pointed questions of the day on the topic. ''He's under the gun down there.''
While she said she disagreed with him, she added: ''He probably would be our very best candidate - right now.''
On his fourth visit to Iowa as a presidential candidate, Mr. Perry did not take questions from reporters. His aides and Texas Rangers often formed a semicircle around him as he shook hands and signed autographs at the end of an event.
Mr. Perry smiled but declined to answer a question from a reporter here, then approached a group of three women. A few moments later, though, he was back to immigration, when Mrs. Groff-Moritz grabbed his arm, looked him in the eye and said she had a question about the in-state tuition.
-''Yes ma'am,'' he said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Back To the Land, Reluctantly

BYLINE: By SUSAN GREGORY THOMAS

 BODY:
Susan Gregory Thomas is the author of ''In Spite of Everything: A Memoir.''
I'M not interested in being hip or a hippie. Nor does my happiness particularly hinge on artisanal cheese. (Odd, perhaps, given that I grew up a stone fruit's throw away from Chez Panisse in Berkeley, Calif.)
As a 42-year-old Brooklyn mother of three, what I care about is lunch, and feeding my family on a tenuous and unpredictable income. And so I have 20 fresh-egg-producing hens and a little garden that yields everything from blackberries to butternut squash to burdock root. 
My turn with spade and hoe started a few years ago when I found myself divorced and flat broke. My livelihood as a freelance writer went out the window when the economy tanked. I literally could afford beans, the dried kind, which I'd thought were for school art projects or teaching elementary math. And I didn't know how to cook.
Luckily, my late father had hammered into me that grit was more important than talent. So, when I couldn't afford fancy food -- never mind paraben-free shampoo -- for my babies, I figured, if peasants in 11th-century Sicily did all this, how hard could it be?
I researched how to raise hens from chicks so we could get our omega-3-filled eggs. I learned to stretch a single piece of cheap meat into nearly a week's worth of dinners. I made my own cleaning products. Not because I liked it. Because it was cheap.
My goal was to have healthy, unprocessed food for $10 or less a day. Cereal was the first thing to go. It dawned on me that making granola was a matter of tossing oatmeal and nuts into a bowl with a little oil, honey and spices -- and then baking until brown. No more $14 boxes of fancy grains with pomegranate antioxidants.
Bread wasn't hard either; it was just a drawn-out procedure. Yeast, water, a little honey, salt, whole wheat flour, and assorted seeds. Mix; wait for rising; knead; wait; knead; wait; bake. I made batches and froze them. So long, Eli Zabar's 10-buck Health Loaf. Hi there, homemade loaf for less than $1. I soon realized that it's not necessary to follow every recipe to a T, particularly if it calls for expensive items. For example, if a recipe called for red wine, I used diluted balsamic vinegar, or even apple cider vinegar and a wee bit of honey mixed with water. If the recipe called for saffron I used turmeric, which is cheap in bulk at Patel Brothers in Jackson Heights, Queens. And I always added twice as much garlic to everything.
With all the fetishizing about terroirs and concerns about lead in urban soil in the eco-foodie blogosphere, I was scared to grow vegetables, period. But my kids and I planted seeds, bulbs and rhizomes inside in midwinter in little cups; we started a universe of tomatoes, squash, green beans, kale, beets, garlic and standard herbs. They were ready for planting by spring.
We quelled concerns about lead in the soil by hammering together boards to make a raised bed, and made ''good'' dirt from compost of decaying leaves and coffee grounds and the cheap soil at Home Depot. It quickly became obvious that anyone with a rectangle of sunny ground outside can grow stuff; you just need to think about what grows up and what grows sideways so that you can get it all in there properly.
We lived off the land all summer, supplementing our diet with dried beans, nuts, baking basics, dairy products, olive oil, and the occasional long-lasting protein (pork shoulder, chicken, canned anchovies and sardines). The children snipped off the fixings for homemade pizza, pasta, tarts and Mediterranean-like bean salads. I made yogurt and even got the hang of making ricotta and mozzarella by heating up milk in a pot and squirting a little animal rennet in it. And it was not a hassle. Plus, homemade ricotta, with a little olive oil, honey and fresh basil for dessert? Homemade frozen yogurt pops with just-plucked blackberries? Crazy. We were locavore, organic kings.
I had to be sold on the chicken idea, two years later. It seemed like a lot of work, flies and yucky upkeep. But an out-of-work antiques restorer (who later became my boyfriend and is now my husband) persuaded me to do it. We ordered 2-day-old peeping chicks for $2.75 apiece by mail and kept them under heat lamps in a Pack 'n Play in my daughters' room for about a month, and they became the coolest pets and science lesson ever. Five months later, we had a coop and four hens.
Today, we eat a mostly vegetarian diet, with plenty of protein. My cleaning products are distilled white vinegar for wiping and baking soda for scouring (and also for tooth brushing). Our soap and shampoo is Castile mixed with olive oil. We live this way for $100 a week. And I'm still the sole breadwinner.
IT is a lot of work. You have to be organized and able to improvise on your feet. But, frankly, it's awesome. Before we embarked on this Waldenesque life, the only thing I had ever used my hands for was picking up a book or typing on my keyboard; today, my family and I are living our own scrappy take on President Obama's promise of ''Yes, we can!''
Even if things turn around financially, I don't think I could stomach going to Whole Foods (except maybe for olive oil) because my biggest revelation in terms of self-sufficiency is this: It is no big deal. You can tell yourself anything is too difficult, or you can just do it. And you do not need to reconstruct your worldview or take issue with others.
You just need to be hungry.

HEADLINE: After the Storm, Fall Foliage Deals

BYLINE: By MICHELLE HIGGINS

 BODY:
ABUNDANT rain and an early September cold snap are making for spectacular fall foliage throughout much of New England this season. But reports of destruction by Tropical Storm Irene, which washed out roads and flooded towns in parts of Vermont, New Hampshire and upstate New York, could be leaving the tourist season in jeopardy.
Visitors who do venture out in search of fall colors and pick-your-own orchards will find that most hotels are open and offering attractive deals to lure visitors. And while some roads are still being worked on, most major arteries have reopened. For instance, in Vermont, about 95 percent of the state's roads are now open, including Route 4, a critical east-west corridor that was shut for more than two weeks after the storm. 
Even in areas that were largely unaffected by the storm, tourism and hotel officials are proactively hawking deals. Though Sunday River in Newry, Me., was ''unscathed,'' said Darcy Morse, a spokeswoman, the resort created a foliage package, from $139, that includes a 10 percent lodging discount, breakfast for two and a Chondola ride ''to help combat any misperceptions.'' The Cape Codder Resort & Spa in Hyannis, Mass., which also fell largely out of the storm's path, is offering a Post Irene family two-night vacation package from $148, with up to $60 in meal vouchers.
And Massvacation.com offers a detour map for Route 2, parts of which are still closed, in western Massachusetts.
Below, an overview of three hard-hit regions that are rolling out deals to help encourage visits during leaf-peeping season.
New Hampshire
New Hampshire was not as severely affected by Irene as southern Vermont and parts of the Catskills, but the Kancamagus Highway (Route 112), which runs through prime leaf-peeping areas of the White Mountains, was closed for two weeks. Thanks in part to speedy recovery work (the road is now open) and aggressive marketing, New Hampshire officials are hoping that bookings stay the same or even improve over last year.
To spur fall bookings, the Mt. Washington Bed &Breakfast in Shelburne is offering discounted rates starting at $100 a night to travelers who stay a minimum of three nights through Oct. 23. And the Will's Inn, which offers motel rooms, family suites and rental cottages in Bartlett, is taking 10 percent off a one-night stay and 15 percent off two nights to anyone who mentions the Irene Special.
Upstate New York
While the storm did some of its worst damage to small Catskill communities like Prattsville and Windham in Greene County in the Great Northern Catskills, roadways and bridges are open, and restaurants and attractions including Hunter Mountain, Windham Mountain and nine area golf courses are moving forward with annual fall activities.
With all the disaster-related stories, ''there's a perception that the storm had such great damage and lasting impacts,'' said Warren Hart, director of economic development, tourism and planning for Greene County. ''And that's just not the case.''
Hunter Mountain is hosting local bands and family activities this weekend (Oct. 8 and 9) for Oktoberfest, where admission is free. And the Thomas Cole National Historic Site is offering a guided hike Oct. 15 to Sunset Rock and Catskill Mountain House to see the landscape that inspired artists of the Hudson River School.
In Ulster County, where tourism is a $420 million industry with roughly 40 percent of that accounted for in the fall, tourism officials report that hotels and restaurants are ready for visitors, though a few minor detours might be involved. Because of a major washout east of Phoenicia, for example, the Catskill Mountain Railroad's Esopus Scenic Train now travels along a modified five-mile round trip between Mt. Tremper and Boiceville. It used to be a 12-mile trip from Mt. Temper to Phoenicia. Fares have been reduced to $12 for adults and $7 for children ages 4 to 11.
''Although we had our share of flood damage and road closures from Hurricane Irene, all the main roads are now open and certainly will be fully operational for the leaf-peeping season in Ulster County,'' said Richard J. Remsnyder, Ulster County tourism director. ''Our wineries, farm markets, u-picks and orchards are throwing their doors wide open and preparing for a busy season.''
Vermont
In Vermont, where the critical fall foliage season normally brings in more than $300 million in business, reports of the destruction left in the storm's wake -- accompanied by images of collapsed bridges, washed-out roads and flooded towns -- have affected bookings, even though major highway arteries and businesses have reopened.
''Even in areas unaffected, or quickly recovering, post-Irene reports have resulted in cancellations of tours and travel plans that have rendered tourist-dependent businesses idle and beds across the state's hotels and inns empty,'' according to a statement on VermontPartners.org, the Web site for the state's special, post-Irene tourism task force.
To show potential vacationers that ''Vermont is 'open for business' despite Irene,'' Vermont's Chamber of Commerce has been crowd-sourcing video submissions from tourism businesses around the state and posting them on its Facebook page. Featured businesses range from the Moose Meadow Lodge in Waterbury, which points out, ''We have lots of availability,'' to the Vermont Maple BBQ truck, based in Randolph, which implores visitors, ''We miss you, come back.''
To attract visitors, the town of Brandon, at the crossroads of Routes 7 and 73, halfway between Rutland and Middlebury, is offering $50 in ''Brandon Bucks,'' to be used in restaurants, shops, wineries and galleries, to the first 100 new bookings of a two-night stay at one of 11 participating properties. And the Four Columns Inn in Newfane is offering a Goodnight Irene Fall Foliage package from $538 for a two-night stay that includes a 15 percent room discount, a bottle of champagne or wine upon arrival, daily breakfast and one three-course dinner.
Yes, recovery efforts are still under way in parts of the state.
While Route 4, a critical east-west corridor from I-89 to Killington, which had been severely damaged by the storm, is now open -- offering access once again to many inns, restaurants and other tourist businesses -- some roads are still being worked on. A section of Route 107 in Stockbridge that was washed out by Irene, for example, remains closed, forcing drivers traveling between, say, Montpelier and Rutland to take a longer route. Vermontvacation.com has updated information about road conditions and attractions on its interactive Vermont Is Open map.
''In truth,'' Chris Sprague, an innkeeper at the Inn at Ormsby Hill in Manchester, wrote in an e-mail message, ''we can all get around without a problem -- perhaps a little detour here or there or a dirt road where there was a regular road -- but we are accessible.''

HEADLINE: Protesters Against Wall Street: It's obvious what they want. What took so long, and where are the nation's leaders?

 BODY:
As the Occupy Wall Street protests spread from Lower Manhattan to Washington and other cities, the chattering classes keep complaining that the marchers lack a clear message and specific policy prescriptions. The message -- and the solutions -- should be obvious to anyone who has been paying attention since the economy went into a recession that continues to sock the middle class while the rich have recovered and prospered. The problem is that no one in Washington has been listening.
At this point, protest is the message: income inequality is grinding down that middle class, increasing the ranks of the poor, and threatening to create a permanent underclass of able, willing but jobless people. On one level, the protesters, most of them young, are giving voice to a generation of lost opportunity. 
The jobless rate for college graduates under age 25 has averaged 9.6 percent over the past year; for young high school graduates, the average is 21.6 percent. Those figures do not reflect graduates who are working but in low-paying jobs that do not even require diplomas. Such poor prospects in the early years of a career portend a lifetime of diminished prospects and lower earnings -- the very definition of downward mobility.
The protests, though, are more than a youth uprising. The protesters' own problems are only one illustration of the ways in which the economy is not working for most Americans. They are exactly right when they say that the financial sector, with regulators and elected officials in collusion, inflated and profited from a credit bubble that burst, costing millions of Americans their jobs, incomes, savings and home equity. As the bad times have endured, Americans have also lost their belief in redress and recovery.
The initial outrage has been compounded by bailouts and by elected officials' hunger for campaign cash from Wall Street, a toxic combination that has reaffirmed the economic and political power of banks and bankers, while ordinary Americans suffer.
Extreme inequality is the hallmark of a dysfunctional economy, dominated by a financial sector that is driven as much by speculation, gouging and government backing as by productive investment.
When the protesters say they represent 99 percent of Americans, they are referring to the concentration of income in today's deeply unequal society. Before the recession, the share of income held by those in the top 1 percent of households was 23.5 percent, the highest since 1928 and more than double the 10 percent level of the late 1970s.
That share declined slightly as financial markets tanked in 2008, and updated data is not yet available, but inequality has almost certainly resurged. In the last few years, for instance, corporate profits (which flow largely to the wealthy) have reached their highest level as a share of the economy since 1950, while worker pay as a share of the economy is at its lowest point since the mid-1950s.
Income gains at the top would not be as worrisome as they are if the middle class and the poor were also gaining. But working-age households saw their real income decline in the first decade of this century. The recession and its aftermath have only accelerated the decline.
Research shows that such extreme inequality correlates to a host of ills, including lower levels of educational attainment, poorer health and less public investment. It also skews political power, because policy almost invariably reflects the views of upper-income Americans versus those of lower-income Americans.
No wonder then that Occupy Wall Street has become a magnet for discontent. There are plenty of policy goals to address the grievances of the protesters -- including lasting foreclosure relief, a financial transactions tax, greater legal protection for workers' rights, and more progressive taxation. The country needs a shift in the emphasis of public policy from protecting the banks to fostering full employment, including public spending for job creation and development of a strong, long-term strategy to increase domestic manufacturing.
It is not the job of the protesters to draft legislation. That's the job of the nation's leaders, and if they had been doing it all along there might not be a need for these marches and rallies. Because they have not, the public airing of grievances is a legitimate and important end in itself. It is also the first line of defense against a return to the Wall Street ways that plunged the nation into an economic crisis from which it has yet to emerge.

HEADLINE: The Left Declares Its Independence

BYLINE: By TODD GITLIN

 BODY:
Todd Gitlin is a professor of journalism and communications at Columbia and co-author of ''The Chosen Peoples: America, Israel, and the Ordeals of Divine Election.''
IF some aspects of the Occupy Wall Street protest feel predictable -- the drum circles, the signs, including ''Tax Wall Street Transactions'' and ''End the FED'' -- so does the right-wing response. Is it any surprise that Fox News and its allied bloggers consider the protesters ''deluded'' and ''dirty smelly hippies''?
Then again, maybe it is surprising. As more than a few observers have noted, the Occupy Wall Street chant, ''We Are the 99 Percent'' -- a shot across the bow of the wealthiest 1 percent of the country, which includes the financial predators and confidence gamers who crashed the global economy with impunity -- seems synonymous with the Tea Party's ''Take Back America'' ethos.
Those similarities, though, mask profound differences. The two movements both loathe the elite, but their goals, and the passions that drive them forward, could not be more at odds. 
The Tea Party, for all its apparent populism, revolves around a vision of power and how to attain it. Tea Partiers tend to be white, male, Republican, graying, married and comfortable; the political system once worked for them, and they think it can be made to do so again. They revile government, but they adore hierarchy and order. Not for them the tents and untucked shirts, the tattoos, piercings and dreadlocks that are eye candy for lazy journalists. (''Am I dressed too nice so the media doesn't interview me?'' read one Occupy Wall Street demonstrator's sign.)
In contrast, what should we make of Occupy Wall Street? The movement is, of course, nascent, and growing: on Oct. 5, it picked up thousands of marching supporters of all ages, many from unions, professions and universities, and crowded Foley Square. Its equivalents rallied in 50 cities. Deep anger at grotesque inequities extends far beyond this one encampment; after all, a few handfuls of young activists do not have a monopoly on the fight against plutocracy. Revulsion in the face of a perverse economy is felt by many respectable people: unemployed, not yet unemployed, shakily employed and plain disgusted. A month from now, this movement, still busy being born, could look quite different.
And yet it remains true that the core of the movement, the (mostly young and white, skilled but jobless) people who started the ''occupation'' three weeks ago, consists of what right-wing critics call anarchists. Indeed, some occupiers take the point as a compliment -- because that is precisely the quality that sets them apart from the Tea Party. Anarchism has been the reigning spirit of left-wing protest movements for nearly the past half century, as it is in Zuccotti Park.
IN this recent incarnation, anarchism, for the most part, is not so much a theory of the absence of government, but a theory of self-organization, or direct democracy, as government. The idea is that you do not need institutions because the people, properly assembled, properly deliberating, even in one square block of Lower Manhattan, can regulate themselves. Those with the time and patience can frolic and practice direct democracy at the same time -- at least until the first frost.
The anarchist impulse is nothing new in America. There were strong anarchist streaks in the New Left of the 1960s -- stronger than the socialist streak, in fact, despite all the work Marxists did to define proper class categories for the student movement. ''Let the people decide,'' one of the early rallying cries of Students for a Democratic Society (of which I was president from 1963 to 1964), meant, in practice, ''Let's have long meetings where everyone gets to talk.'' De facto, this meant that politics was for people who, in a sense, talked for a living -- in other words, college types.
It was a revolutionary idea, at least for its time and in certain places: in the Deep South, for civil rights workers and black farm workers just to meet and talk was a dangerously radical, and radically dangerous, proposition.
But the left's distrust of outside authority reached, and still reaches, much further. The bumper sticker of the 1960s New Left could have been Bob Dylan's lyric ''Don't follow leaders, watch the parkin' meters,'' cheekily pairing hierarchy with overregulation. By 1967, its membership soaring, the S.D.S. was so suspicious of leadership, so disdainful of the formal structures of its first five years, as to abolish its own presidential and vice-presidential offices.
As the S.D.S. discovered in 1969, when quarreling Maoist-Guevarist and Stalinist factions tore it apart, chaotic meetings and suspicion of formal procedures didn't keep tiny hierarchies from exercising decisive control. Radical feminists came to similar conclusions. Nevertheless, hostility to elitism remained all the rage. From the early '70s on, activists went into revolt against just about anybody's authority, even their own. Vertical authority had a foul odor: it smacked of colonialism, patriarchy, bad white men lording themselves over voiceless minions. In left-wing activist circles, establishments of all sorts were the immoral equivalents of The Establishment.
Disgruntled by big-talking leaders, turned off by celebrity media, the left of the '70s developed a horizontal style, according limited authority to their own leaders, who were frequently at pains to deny that they were leaders at all. ''Affinity groups'' and ''working groups'' replaced organized factions and parties. Even movements that seemed to require some level of verticality -- those with concrete goals, like banning nuclear power and weapons, or opposing apartheid -- were mostly leaderless.
That explains why, to the bafflement of their ideological opponents, such movements barely paused at the fall of Communism. When Leninist regimes collapsed, and their self-confident social democratic rivals crumpled as well, anarchism's major competitors for a theory of organization imploded.
This new protest style is more Rousseau than Marx. What the Zuccotti Park encampment calls horizontal democracy is spunky, polymorphic, energetic, theatrical, scattered and droll. An early poster showed a ballerina poised gingerly on the back of Wall Street's bull sculpture, bearing the words: ''Occupy Wall Street. September 17th. Bring Tent.'' It likes government more than corporations, but its own style is hardly governmental. It tends to care about process more than results.
And oh, how it loves to talk. It is no surprise that it makes fervent use of the technologies of horizontal communication, of Facebook and Twitter, though the instinct predated -- perhaps prefigured -- those tools. Not coincidentally, this was also the spirit of the more or less leaderless, partyless revolutions of Tunisia and Egypt that are claimed as inspiration in Lower Manhattan. An ''American Autumn'' is their shot at an echo of the ''Arab Spring.''
OCCUPY Wall Street, then, emanates from a culture -- strictly speaking, a counterculture -- that is diametrically opposed to Tea Party discipline.
So where do these romantics go from here? The Zuccotti Park core doesn't seem to have a plan, or even to take kindly to the idea of consolidating a list of demands. And yet, by taking the initiative, they have aroused, as with the Oct. 5 march, less romantic and more conventionally organized allies who do not disdain political demands. Such is the cunning of political history. Having set out to be expressive, the anarchists have found themselves playing, willy-nilly, a most strategic role.
Such movements hope to remain forever under construction, fluid, unfixed. They slip laughingly through the nets of journalism, which prefers hard-and-fast answers to the question ''What do you people want?''
But the interesting, difficult, even decisive moment in the career of such a movement comes when allies arrive, especially allies not so enamored of horizontal democracy and more taken by the idea of getting results. These forces showed up on Oct. 5. De facto, there is an alliance in the cards.
It makes sense. Here, finally, is what labor and the activist left have been waiting for. For two years, Barack Obama got the benefit of the doubt from fervent supporters -- I'd bet that many of those in Lower Manhattan during these weeks went door-to-door for him in 2008 -- and that support explains why no one occupied Wall Street in 2009. Now, as Jeremy Varon, a historian at the New School, said of Zuccotti Park: ''This is the Obama generation declaring their independence from his administration.''
By allying itself with the protest, the left at large is telling the president that a campaign slogan that essentially says ''We're better than Eric Cantor'' won't cut it in 2012. ''We are the 99 percent'' would be more like it. If President Obama takes this direction, the movement's energy may be able to power a motor of significant reform.
That raises the question, though, of whether the inchoate quality of the Occupy Wall Street movement can continue. Probably not, since an evolving alliance demands concrete goals, strategies and compromises. But perhaps something of the initial free spirit can flourish. There is plenty of public sentiment to nourish it. It doesn't take public opinion polls to detect American anger at the plutocracy and the impunity with which it lords it over the country.
The culture of anarchy is right about this: The corporate rich -- those ostensible ''job creators'' who somehow haven't gotten around to creating jobs -- rule the Republican Party and much of the Democratic Party as well, having artfully arranged a mutual back-scratching society to enrich themselves. A refusal to compromise with this system, defined by its hierarchies of power and money, would be the current moment of anarchy's great, lasting contribution.
Until now, fury at the plutocracy and the political class had found no channel to run in but the antigovernment fantasies of the Tea Party. Now it has dug a new channel. Anger does not move countries, but it moves movements -- and movements, in turn, can move countries. To do that, movements need leverage. Even Archimedes needed a lever and a place to stand to move the world. When Zuccotti Park meets an aroused liberalism, the odd couple may not live happily ever after. But they can make a serious run at American dreams of ''liberty and justice for all.''

HEADLINE: Stand Up and Be Counted

BYLINE: By PHILIP GALANES

 BODY:
My girlfriend and I attended opening night at the Metropolitan Opera, featuring the world-class soprano Anna Netrebko. She was magnificent, and at the end of the evening, we gave her a standing ovation. The woman behind us called out loudly: ''Sit down. I can't see.'' This led to a testy exchange with her companion: ''The singers can't see you standing.'' Besides being irritated by them and with myself (for being pulled into this quarrel), I was bewildered that anyone could think of a standing ovation as rude. Your thoughts? Anonymous, New York City
Standing O's are a time-honored way for audiences to express gratitude (and joy) for thrilling performances. I have given two in the last three weeks: to Elaine Stritch after her one-woman show at the Carlyle Hotel, and to Mariano Rivera when he broke the record for the most saves in baseball history. (For the latter, I stood alone in my study.) 
Much has been written of ovation-inflation: the tendency for audiences to give Ellen DeGeneres a standing ovation, for instance, for merely walking onto her stage set. Yes, she is lovable, but she hasn't done anything yet. Same with mediocre theater evenings in New York City. You're standing for that?
But unanimous agreement is not required. If you were moved by Ms. Netrebko's performance, it was your absolute right to stand and cheer (not to be confused with the indie rock band Clap Your Hands and Say Yeah).
Feel free to ignore the cranks behind you. It may have been different if the woman told you she was unable to stand; you might have resumed your seat on compassionate grounds. As to her friend's reasoning that the singers can't see you, who cares? I bet they felt it.
So, cheer on -- and let me cheer you for supporting the embattled arts (though I confess I am not standing).
Neighbor, Not Sitter
I am friendly with my neighbors, who occasionally ask me to baby-sit their children. I am retired and stay home most of the time. The children are well-behaved, but sometimes I don't feel like baby-sitting. Still, it's difficult to make up excuses because we live next door, and I can't say that I'm going out when they see my every move. I'd like to come up with a list of excuses. What do you recommend? Anonymous
Tear up your excuse list into itty-bitty pieces and toss them onto ticker-tape parades for Elaine Stritch and Mariano Rivera. It sounds as if sometimes you're willing to baby-sit, and others, not so much. This makes you a good and generous neighbor. No need for excuses on the days you don't feel like it. Just say: ''Sorry, I can't today.''
Your desire to elaborate reflects a guilty conscience. But you have no reason to feel guilty, dear lady. Be warned that my approach may take practice; you will want to toss in an excuse, but don't. Trust me, it's worth it.
It's Your Move
My boyfriend and I have decided to move in together. He owns his apartment, so I will be moving to his place. But I'm worried about my current roommate (and friend). We'd been planning to look for another apartment when our lease is up. I want to tell him soon, but I'm not sure how he'll react. And I feel guilty. Is two months' notice enough?
Phil, Kew Gardens
Congratulations on taking your relationship to the next level, Phil. As for roomie, better to tell him pronto (and maximize his time for house-hunting) than spend another second worrying about your guilt. Two months' notice seems plenty, but that probably depends on the housing market in your area.
You may lessen his load by helping with the search; four eyes can scan Craigslist much faster than two. And if it's a super-tight market (and your beau agrees), you can always pull a ''Three's Company'' and let your roommate bunk with you until he lands on his feet.
Bite Your Tongue
A family in our neighborhood has a 3-year-old son who is morbidly obese. The poor little boy's thighs rub together so tightly that he can't even run. The parents are also obese, as are their other children. It breaks my heart to see these children suffer. Is there anything I can (or should) say to the parents?
Kris, Wisconsin
It would be one thing if these parents lived far from their children, in a world without Skype. But chances are they already know that their little ones are not so little. So what on earth could you say to them that wouldn't sound superior or make them feel defensive? I know we've grown fond of saying, ''It takes a village to raise a child,'' but I'd keep your pity to yourself in this case and invite them to a game of whiffle ball instead.

THE BETTER ANGELS OF OUR NATURE
Why Violence Has Declined
By Steven Pinker
Illustrated. 802 pp. Viking. $40.
It is unusual for the subtitle of a book to undersell it, but Steven Pinker's ''Better Angels of Our Nature'' tells us much more than why violence has declined. Pinker, a professor of psychology at Harvard who first became widely known as the author of ''The Language Instinct,'' addresses some of the biggest questions we can ask: Are human beings essentially good or bad? Has the past century witnessed moral progress or a moral collapse? Do we have grounds for being optimistic about the future? 
If that sounds like a book you would want to read, wait, there's more. In 800 information-packed pages, Pinker also discusses a host of more specific issues. Here is a sample: What do we owe to the Enlightenment? Is there a link between the human rights movement and the campaign for animal rights? Why are homicide rates higher in the southerly states of this country than in northern ones? Are aggressive tendencies heritable? Could declines in violence in particular societies be attributed to genetic change among its members? How does a president's I.Q. correlate with the number of battle deaths in wars in which the United States is involved? Are we getting smarter? Is a smarter world a better world?
In seeking answers to these questions Pinker draws on recent research in history, psychology, cognitive science, economics and sociology. Nor is he afraid to venture into deep philosophical waters, like the role of reason in ethics and whether, without appealing to religion, some ethical views can be grounded in reason and others cannot be.
The central thesis of ''Better Angels'' is that our era is less violent, less cruel and more peaceful than any previous period of human existence. The decline in violence holds for violence in the family, in neighborhoods, between tribes and between states. People living now are less likely to meet a violent death, or to suffer from violence or cruelty at the hands of others, than people living in any previous century.
Pinker assumes that many of his readers will be skeptical of this claim, so he spends six substantial chapters documenting it. That may sound like a hard slog, but for anyone interested in understanding human nature, the material is engrossing, and when the going gets heavy, Pinker knows how to lighten it with ironic comments and a touch of humor.
Pinker begins with studies of the causes of death in different eras and peoples. Some studies are based on skeletons found at archaeological sites; averaging their results suggests that 15 percent of prehistoric humans met a violent death at the hands of another person. Research into contemporary or recent hunter-gatherer societies yields a remarkably similarly average, while another cluster of studies of pre-state societies that include some horticulture has an even higher rate of violent death. In contrast, among state societies, the most violent appears to have been Aztec Mexico, in which 5 percent of people were killed by others. In Europe, even during the bloodiest periods -- the 17th century and the first half of the 20th --/ deaths in war were around 3 percent. The data vindicates Hobbes's basic insight, that without a state, life is likely to be ''nasty, brutish and short.'' In contrast, a state monopoly on the legitimate use of force reduces violence and makes everyone living under that monopoly better off than they would otherwise have been. Pinker calls this the ''pacification process.''
It's not only deaths in war, but murder, too, that is declining over the long term. Even those tribal peoples extolled by anthropologists as especially ''gentle,'' like the Semai of Malaysia, the Kung of the Kalahari and the Central Arctic Inuit, turn out to have murder rates that are, relative to population, comparable to those of Detroit. In Europe, your chance of being murdered is now less than one-tenth, and in some countries only one-fiftieth, of what it would have been if you had lived 500 years ago. American rates, too, have fallen steeply over the past two or three centuries. Pinker sees this decline as part of the ''civilizing process,'' a term he borrows from the sociologist Norbert Elias, who attributes it to the consolidation of the power of the state above feudal loyalties, and to the effect of the spread of commerce. (Consistent with this view, Pinker argues that at least part of the reason for the regional differences in American homicide rates is that people in the South are less likely to accept the state's monopoly on force. Instead, a tradition of self-help justice and a ''culture of honor'' sanctions retaliation when one is insulted or mistreated. Statistics bear this out -- the higher homicide rate in the South is due to quarrels that turn lethal, not to more killings during armed robberies -- and experiments show that even today Southerners respond more strongly to insults than Northerners.)
During the Enlightenment, in 17th-and 18th-century Europe and countries under European influence, another important change occurred. People began to look askance at forms of violence that had previously been taken for granted: slavery, torture, despotism, dueling and extreme forms of cruel punishment. Voices even began to be raised against cruelty to animals. Pinker refers to this as the ''humanitarian revolution.''
Against the background of Europe's relatively peaceful period after 1815, the first half of the 20th century seems like a sharp drop into an unprecedented moral abyss. But in the 13th century, the brutal Mongol conquests caused the deaths of an estimated 40 million people -- not so far from the 55 million who died in the Second World War -- in a world with only one-seventh the population of the mid-20th century. The Mongols rounded up and massacred their victims in cold blood, just as the Nazis did, though they had only battle-axes instead of guns and gas chambers. A longer perspective enables us to see that the crimes of Hitler and Stalin were, sadly, less novel than we thought.
Since 1945, we have seen a new phenomenon known as the ''long peace'': for 66 years now, the great powers, and developed nations in general, have not fought wars against one another. More recently, since the end of the cold war, a broader ''new peace'' appears to have taken hold. It is not, of course, an absolute peace, but there has been a decline in all kinds of organized conflicts, including civil wars, genocides, repression and terrorism. Pinker admits that followers of our news media will have particular difficulty in believing this, but as always, he produces statistics to back up his assertions.
The final trend Pinker discusses is the ''rights revolution,'' the revulsion against violence inflicted on ethnic minorities, women, children, homosexuals and animals that has developed over the past half-century. Pinker is not, of course, arguing that these movements have achieved their goals, but he reminds us how far we have come in a relatively short time from the days when lynchings were commonplace in the South; domestic violence was tolerated to such a degree that a 1950s ad could show a husband with his wife over his knees, spanking her for failing to buy the right brand of coffee; and Pinker, then a young research assistant working under the direction of a professor in an animal behavior lab, tortured a rat to death. (Pinker now considers this ''the worst thing I have ever done.'' In 1975 it wasn't uncommon.)
What caused these beneficial trends? That question poses a special challenge to an author who has consistently argued against the view that humans are blank slates on which culture and education draws our character, good or evil. There has hardly been time for the changes to have a basis in genetic evolution. (Pinker considers this possibility, and dismisses it.) So don't the trends that Pinker chronicles prove that our nature is more the product of our culture than our biology? That way of putting it assumes a simplistic nature-nurture dichotomy. In books like ''How the Mind Works,''''The Blank Slate'' and ''The Stuff of Thought,'' Pinker has argued that evolution shaped the basic design of our brain, and hence our cognitive and emotional faculties. This process has given us propensities to violence -- our ''inner demons'' as well as ''the better angels of our nature'' (Abraham Lincoln's words) -- that incline us to be peaceful and cooperative. Our material circumstances, along with cultural inputs, determine whether the demons or the angels have the upper hand.
Other large-scale trends have paralleled the decline in violence and cruelty, but it is not easy to sort out cause and effect here. Are factors like better government, greater prosperity, health, education, trade and improvements in the status of women the cause or the effect of the decline in violence and cruelty? If we can find out, we may be able to preserve and extend the peaceful and better world in which we live. So in two chapters on human psychology, Pinker does his best to discover what has restrained our inner demons and unleashed our better angels, and then in a final chapter, draws his conclusions.
Those conclusions are not always what one might expect. Yes, as already noted, the state monopoly on force is important, and the spread of commerce creates incentives for cooperation and against violent conflict. The empowerment of women does, Pinker argues, exercise a pacifying influence, and the world would be more peaceful if women were in charge. But he also thinks that the invention of printing, and the development of a cosmopolitan ''Republic of Letters'' in the 17th and 18th centuries helped to spread ideas that led to the humanitarian revolution. That was pushed further in the 19th century by popular novels like ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' and ''Oliver Twist'' that, by encouraging readers to put themselves in the position of someone very different from themselves, expanded the sphere of our moral concern.
To readers familiar with the literature in evolutionary psychology and its tendency to denigrate the role reason plays in human behavior, the most striking aspect of Pinker's account is that the last of his ''better angels'' is reason. Here he draws on a metaphor I used in my 1981 book ''The Expanding Circle.'' To indicate that reason can take us to places that we might not expect to reach, I wrote of an ''escalator of reason'' that can take us to a vantage point from which we see that our own interests are similar to, and from the point of view of the universe do not matter more than, the interests of others. Pinker quotes this passage, and then goes on to develop the argument much more thoroughly than I ever did. (Disclosure: Pinker wrote an endorsement for a recent reissue of ''The Expanding Circle.'')
Pinker's claim that reason is an important factor in the trends he has described relies in part on the ''Flynn effect'' -- the remarkable finding by the philosopher James Flynn that ever since I.Q. tests were first administered, the scores achieved by those taking the test have been rising. The average I.Q. is, by definition, 100; but to achieve that result, raw test scores have to be standardized. If the average teenager today could go back in time and take an I.Q. test from 1910, he or she would have an I.Q. of 130, which would be better than 98 percent of those taking the test then. Nor is it easy to attribute this rise to improved education, because the aspects of the tests on which scores have risen most do not require a good vocabulary or even mathematical ability, but instead test powers of abstract reasoning. One theory is that we have gotten better at I.Q. tests because we live in a more symbol-rich environment. Flynn himself thinks that the spread of the scientific mode of reasoning has played a role.
Pinker argues that enhanced powers of reasoning give us the ability to detach ourselves from our immediate experience and from our personal or parochial perspective, and frame our ideas in more abstract, universal terms. This in turn leads to better moral commitments, including avoiding violence. It is just this kind of reasoning ability that has improved during the 20th century. He therefore suggests that the 20th century has seen a ''moral Flynn effect, in which an accelerating escalator of reason carried us away from impulses that lead to violence'' and that this lies behind the long peace, the new peace, and the rights revolution. Among the wide range of evidence he produces in support of that argument is the tidbit that since 1946, there has been a negative correlation between an American president's I.Q. and the number of battle deaths in wars involving the United States.
Reason also, Pinker suggests, moves us away from forms of morality more likely to lead to violence, and toward moral advances that, while not eschewing the use of force altogether, restrict it to the uses necessary to improve social welfare, like utilitarian reforms of the savage punishments given to criminals in earlier times. For reason does, Pinker holds, point to a particular kind of morality. We prefer life to death, and happiness to suffering, and we understand that we live in a world in which others can make a difference to whether we live well or die miserably. Therefore we will want to tell others that they should not hurt us, and in doing so we commit ourselves to the idea that we should not hurt them. (Pinker quotes a famous sentence from the 18th-century philosopher William Godwin: ''What magic is there in the pronoun 'my' that should justify us in overturning the decisions of impartial truth?'') That morality can be grounded in some commitment to treating others as we would like them to treat us is an ancient idea, expressed in the golden rule and in similar thoughts in the moral traditions of many other civilizations, but Pinker is surely right to say that the escalator of reason leads us to it. It is this kind of moral thinking, Pinker points out, that helps us escape traps like the Cuban missile crisis, which, if the fate of the world had been in the hands of leaders under the sway of a different kind of morality -- one dominated by ideas of honor and the importance of not backing down -- might have been the end of the human story. Fortunately Kennedy and Khrushchev understood the trap they were in and did what was necessary to avoid disaster.
''The Better Angels of Our Nature'' is a supremely important book. To have command of so much research, spread across so many different fields, is a masterly achievement. Pinker convincingly demonstrates that there has been a dramatic decline in violence, and he is persuasive about the causes of that decline. But what of the future? Our improved understanding of violence, of which Pinker's book is an example, can be a valuable tool to maintain peace and reduce crime, but other factors are in play. Pinker is an optimist, but he knows that there is no guarantee that the trends he has documented will continue. Faced with suggestions that the present relatively peaceful period is going to be blown apart by a ''clash of civilizations'' with Islam, by nuclear terrorism, by war with Iran or wars resulting from climate change, he gives reasons for thinking that we have a good chance of avoiding such conflicts, but no more than a good chance. If he had been able to see, before his book went to press, a study published in Nature as recently as August of this year, he might have been less sanguine about maintaining peace despite widespread climate change. Solomon Hsiang and colleagues at Columbia University used data from the past half-century to show that in tropical regions, the risk of a new civil conflict doubles during El Nino years (when temperatures are hotter than usual and there is less rainfall). If that finding is correct, then a warming world could mean the end of the relatively peaceful era in which we are now living.

HEADLINE: One Country's Big Gay Leap

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI

 BODY:
LISBON, Portugal
WHEN she turned 38 last month, Brenda Frota Johnson got a sweet surprise: a formal ''happy birthday'' from her longtime partner's mother.
It wasn't a gift or even a card, just a succinct text message, but even so, it had no precedent over the 10 years that she and her partner, Isabel Advirta, 39, had been making a life and a home here together.
Why this birthday? The two women share a theory.
''Brenda's now officially a part of the family,'' Advirta said recently as they watched their 3-year-old daughter, Salome, play in a leafy Lisbon park. 
Johnson agreed. ''It's because we're married,'' she said. That legal blessing -- that loftiest of imprimaturs -- has changed little between them but a lot around them.
With minimal international attention, Portugal -- tiny, overwhelmingly Roman Catholic Portugal -- legalized same-sex marriage last year. Although the country is hardly seen as a Scandinavian-style bastion of social progressivism, it's one of just 10 countries where such marriages can be performed nationwide, and in this regard it finds itself ahead of a majority of wealthier, more populous European countries, like France, Germany, Italy and Britain. In the United States, only six states and the District of Columbia allow gay marriage. How did that happen? And what wisdom do the answers offer frustrated supporters of same-sex marriage here and elsewhere around the globe?
With a potent case of Portugal envy, I went there and talked with advocates and politicians at the center of its same-sex-marriage campaign and with gay and lesbian couples who married after the law took effect in June 2010. All were still pleasantly stunned by what Portugal had accomplished.
It was only a little more than a decade ago that a country first legalized same-sex marriage, and that happened in precisely the kind of forward-thinking, bohemian place you'd expect: the Netherlands. About two years later, Belgium followed suit.
Then things got really interesting. The eight countries that later joined the club were a mix of largely foreseeable and less predictable additions. In the first category I'd put Canada, Norway, Sweden and Iceland. In the second: South Africa, Spain, Portugal and Argentina.
Why those four countries? People who have studied the issue note that that they have something interesting and relevant in common: each spent a significant period of the late 20th century governed by a dictatorship or brutally discriminatory government, and each emerged from that determined to exhibit a modernity and concern for human rights that put the past to rest.
''They're countries where the commitment to democracy and equal protection under the law was denied, flouted and oppressed, and the societies have struggled to restore that,'' said Evan Wolfson, the president of Freedom to Marry, a New York-based advocacy group, in a recent interview.
That dynamic informed Spain's legalization of same-sex marriage in 2005. Spain's big step also reflected the tenuousness of the Vatican's hold on the everyday mores and behaviors in many developed democracies still spoken of as Roman Catholic. While the vast majority of Spaniards belong nominally to the church and Catholic leaders lobbied against same-sex marriage, the Spanish Parliament nonetheless approved the law. Politicians understood that most Spaniards didn't regard Catholicism as a rigid prescription for living.
Politicians in Portugal and Argentina -- two countries with their own large Catholic majorities, strong geographic or historical ties to Spain, and a palpable desire to keep pace with it -- took note of the same-sex marriage legislation there. Spain set off an Iberian wave with trans-Atlantic reach: one of the countries considered most likely to approve same-sex marriage next is Uruguay, which already permits same-sex civil unions and allows gay men and lesbians to adopt.
''SPAIN was very important for me and for my party,'' said Jose Socrates, the prime minister of Portugal from March 2005 to June 2011, when his center-left Socialist Party lost control to the center-right Social Democratic Party. I talked to him on the phone; he wasn't in Portugal when I was.
The idea that Portugal should do no less than Spain came up repeatedly in my conversations with those who pushed for the Portugal measure, and so did the insistence that Portugal was much more cosmopolitan than many outsiders gave it credit for being.
I was left with the strong impression that for many highly educated and young people in Portugal -- which belongs to both the European Union and the euro zone but doesn't have nearly as much economic or political clout as its peers, and has plunged into fiscal crisis -- same-sex marriage became a badge of sophistication, affirming their country as an enlightened place.
''Certain issues get picked as key debates about a civilization -- as symbolic messages,'' said Miguel Vale de Almeida, a university professor who served in Parliament with the Socialist Party as the legislative body's only openly gay member, from 2009 until earlier this year. Promotion of same-sex marriage branded the party as adaptable and future-oriented.
Portugal was (and to some extent still is) playing catch-up. Its ban on abortion was overturned only four years ago. And in Portugal it remains illegal for a woman without an actual or common-law husband to receive fertility treatments or adopt.
Even same-sex marriage happened not as a reflection of, but in spite of, public opinion polls. As Socrates and others recall, those polls, in 2009, suggested that support for it was about 40 percent at best.
But Socrates nonetheless pledged during a re-election campaign that year to legalize same-sex marriage. To his mind it wouldn't be a pivotal enough concern to turn away voters otherwise supportive of him and the party. Besides, he said, it was a matter of justice.
''It's the obligation of my generation,'' he said, then mentioned two personal influences. A secondary-school classmate, who had been presumed gay and teased about it, committed suicide in his mid-20s. And the movie ''Milk,'' released near the start of his re-election campaign, rekindled that memory and fortified his resolve, which survived opponents' insinuations that Socrates, single since a divorce many years earlier, must be gay.
THAT opposition wasn't as furious as it would be in America, partly because of differences between Portuguese Catholics and our religious right. ''With Catholics here there's a sense of, 'Do what you want, just don't talk too much about it,' '' said Paulo Corte-Real, a leading gay rights advocate in Portugal. While that didn't incline devout Catholics toward supporting same-sex marriage, it diminished their appetite for getting into a huge sustained public fight over it.
And once it became law, everyone for the most part moved on. Socrates's government was tripped up by economic matters, not same-sex marriage, support for which rose significantly in polls following its institution, as people saw that their society wasn't crumbling as a result. ''It was a good example of the pedagogical effect of law,'' Vale de Almeida said.
In the first year of the law's existence, 410 same-sex couples married, and some were surprised, happily, by the reaction.
They said that the state-sanctioned formalization of their partnerships impressed the people around them, especially older relatives who now had a traditional vocabulary and framework -- vows, rings, cake -- for understanding the relationships. Sara and Rita Martinho recalled the striking change in one of Rita's grandfathers, who had resisted acknowledging her sexual orientation, once they were married. He merrily attended the wedding. ''If there's food involved,'' Rita said, ''family will come.'' And he later gave them a set of espresso cups, because he'd noticed they didn't have any.
But progress comes in fits, starts and half steps. Lesbians in Portugal, even married ones, can't get fertility treatments. Same-sex couples can't adopt. Some say there are ways in which they envy America, or at least open-minded corners of it.
After a wedding in Lisbon in June, Manuel Amaral and Goncalo Pereira drove around the Pacific Northwest for their honeymoon. They said that when they told the man at the Avis counter in San Francisco that they were newly married, he upgraded them to a red Mustang.
San Francisco isn't all of America, and the religious dynamics and political vitriol in this country are different from Portugal's. But might it be possible for President Obama, so maddeningly hesitant to endorse same-sex marriage, to take a lead on the issue? And might he find, as Socrates did, that it wouldn't make or break him?
''At the end of the day,'' Socrates told me, ''what we had was the political will.''

HEADLINE: Friends With Benefits

BYLINE: By ARIEL KAMINER

 BODY:
Is it unethical for a relatively wealthy person to apply for and receive unemployment compensation, even if he or she meets all the requirements? Is the answer different in times like the present, when government resources are extremely strained? ANONYMOUS, NEW HOPE, PA.
I put the question to Prof. Bruce Meyer, the University of Chicago economist who has written extensively about unemployment benefits and financial inequality. ''Normally,'' he said, ''I think it actually shows some solidarity for well-off people to be receiving the same social-insurance benefits as others.'' But in times like these, he added, ''I think it's unseemly for someone who's very wealthy to take a lot of benefits from U.I.'' 
I agree; it's unseemly. But that doesn't mean it's unethical.
Unlike welfare, unemployment insurance is not meant for the poor alone. And unlike food at a soup kitchen, it doesn't run out. If the pool of available funds (which employers pay into) runs short, the state simply borrows the money. No one is turned away.
That borrowed money does have to be paid back eventually. Which is why some -- many, I suspect -- would say it's wrong for a person of means to risk expanding the state's deficit or diminishing other programs down the line.
Still, no one seems outraged when people who could afford Pellegrino help themselves to tap water. No one even seems outraged when rich people claim all their legal tax deductions while grumbling about the federal deficit. We operate from a basic societal consensus that it isn't the responsibility of individual citizens to balance the government's budget. If you pay your taxes, you are free to avail yourselves of what they buy. There is no logical reason that permission should exclude the relatively small portion of government benefits that happen to come in the form of a check.
Someone of means could choose to forgo her benefit checks as an act of conscience, a personal donation to the worthy and all-too-needy cause of her state's economy. That would be generous. Just not necessarily effective.
The government doesn't offer these benefits just to be nice. (Note the absence of federally financed flowers for the bereaved or state-issued birthday cards for 1-year-olds.) It does so on the principle that those checks help everyone -- the unemployed people who can then buy food, the grocers who can then sell it and so on, thereby helping to keep the whole economy in motion. If we were in a period of high employment and high inflation, the moral calculus might look different. But in a recession, so long as you spend the money right away, it's not necessarily selfish to take a check you don't need.
If you want the most recession-abating bang for your government-issued buck, spend it on a truly needy person, perhaps an unemployed person who doesn't qualify for benefits or someone at risk of losing his business. That's the best way to ensure that the money will be spent, again, fast. Even better than that, it's kind.
Someone in Greece bought one of my sculptures, but when I sent it, he refused it at customs. He e-mailed asking me to resend it with papers claiming a lower value to help him avoid duty fees. I reluctantly agreed and asked him for the postage. I never heard from him again -- not when the package was sent back to me, the sculpture broken from its odyssey, and not when I repeatedly tried to reach him thereafter. Three years later, on the verge of a move, would it be acceptable to sell the piece to someone else? R. WAKE, TENN.
You, sir, are not just an artist, you are a model -- an artist's model -- of patience. Few others would have shared their storage area for so long just to do right by a guy who apparently doesn't mind doing wrong. This question comes down to whether you are ethically obligated to respect someone's property much more than he does. Even if you do, the best principles sometimes bump up against practical limitations. And this seems to be one of those times. You're out of space and you're out of time.
Three years and numerous attempts to reach him are sufficient to conclude that either a) he died; b) he renounced sculpture in favor of batik; or c) he finally got busted for customs fraud. Even if he still pines for his sculpture, he violated the terms of the sale by tacking on a three-year storage obligation to which you never agreed.
Still, you might as well write him one last time to ask if he would like his money back. It would be a good-faith gesture that would also honor your personal sense of what is moral. When, in the likeliest of events, you don't hear back from him, sell the sculpture with a clear conscience. If against all odds he resurfaces down the line, you can still refund his original payment. Just get him to foot the postage.

You be the judge. Join other readers, and the Ethicist, for an online discussion at nytimes.com/6thfloor on Tuesday, Oct. 11, between 1 p.m. and 5 p.m., E.S.T. about the following question:
I'm an unenrolled voter in a state that allows me to participate in either major-party primary. Since my preferred candidate is unlikely to face any opposition, I am free to vote in the primary of the party whose nominee I will certainly not support in the general election. Would it be wrong to vote for someone whose political views I strongly oppose simply to stir up trouble in the ''enemy'' camp? INDEPENDENT IN MASSACHUSETTS

HEADLINE: Where Stories Are Remembered

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE ROSENBLUM

 BODY:
FOR years, the fourth-floor apartment in Jackson Heights, Queens, where Kewulay and Dionne Kamara raised their family hummed with activity.
The household included three children. Yelka, 22, is Mr. Kamara's daughter. She was born in Sierra Leone, the country where he was born and raised, and in 1998 he rescued her from the civil war that raged there through the 1990s. The couple have two sons, Kalie, 20, and Mory, 18.
The apartment was a magnet for the children's friends. When they had sleepovers, Ms. Kamara, who is Jamaican, cooked up big pots of rice and beans, which everyone consumed sitting on low wooden chairs from Senegal and Ivory Coast, their plates on their laps because there was no dining table. At night, the Kamara children retreated to the bunk beds in the room they shared, and their friends sacked out in sleeping bags and sprawled on the living room sofa.
''I loved every minute of it,'' Ms. Kamara said. 
Nowadays the apartment is quieter. Yelka is a senior at Occidental College in Los Angeles. Kalie is a junior at Marlboro College in Vermont. Mory, a high school senior, is college-bound next year. But even without a houseful of children in residence, the apartment seems generously populated, thanks to works of art and family inheritances that speak to Mr. Kamara's deep roots in his homeland.
Mr. Kamara, 58, was born in Dankawalie, a village of mud houses topped with round grass roofs. His father raised cows and sheep and grew rice, peanuts and cassava. But his primary identity was as a storyteller -- a fina, as many such people are called in West Africa -- and he came from a long line of finas who performed at weddings, funerals and other ceremonial events.
Mr. Kamara's father died when he was 15, and three years later he made his way to the United States, with the help of the Methodist Church, which continued to provide support once he arrived. He received a bachelor's degree from the State University of New York at Oneonta and a master's in economics from the New School. Photographs in the hallway, one showing Mr. Kamara as a boy standing beside his father, and another taken the year he came to the United States, recall the early chapters of his life.
Mr. Kamara has taught for two decades at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. But as with his forebears, the identity that means the most to him is that of a storyteller.
''Not the kind of storyteller you listen to when you're sitting around a fire, and maybe it's raining, and you're scared to go home,'' he said. His stories have to do with genealogy, cosmology and similarly great subjects, and are told while others dance and perform music, making them true multimedia performances.
Ms. Kamara, 40, is a dancer and choreographer whose professional passions are also rooted in her past. ''My great-grandmother on my mother's side is the reason why I dance,'' said Ms. Kamara, who came to the United States with her mother when she was a little girl. ''She was a dancer in the village where I grew up, she played drums, and she encouraged us to sing and dance.''
The couple met in 1989. She was 18, in search of drums and textiles for her performances. He was 35, importing fabric and musical instruments from Africa while studying with an uncle who was a master drummer. The couple married in 1990 and the next year moved to this apartment, for which they pay $1,300 a month.
In 1996 Ms. Kamara joined the dance company Urban Bush Women. A photograph in the hall shows her and her fellow dancers, beaming into the camera during a tour of Brazil. Though she no longer tours, she is still a member of the company, where she teaches, and seven years ago formed her own business, Dionne Kamara Dance, where she also teaches.
If a single image in the apartment captures the world that produced Mr. Kamara, it is his photograph of an enormous silk cotton, or kapok, tree that hangs above the piano.
The tree, with roots that grasp the earth like a gigantic hand, is said to be 150 years old. It stands at the center of Dankawalie, which was founded as a refuge from slave raids. Children play hide and seek in the crevices formed by its roots, and young people flirt beneath its spreading canopy of leaves, especially on moonlit nights during the dry season. Here the ancestral spirits are said to gather.
A raffia hammock from Sierra Leone swings lazily near a front window. ''When I was growing up,'' Mr. Kamara said, ''every home had a hammock like this inside.'' Here he rocked the children to sleep when they were babies.
Near the beige marble fireplace stands a carved woman's head from Sierra Leone, a tiny pigtail sticking out of the back, and the slate on which Mr. Kamara learned to write and to read the Koran -- in a country that lacked books, children memorized religious verses.
An old wooden bellows, the heart of the forge where agricultural tools were made, recalls a traditional rite of village life. Here the blacksmith kneeled, pumping rhythmically as villagers gathered around him and chattered away.
Fabrics and musical instruments from Africa, the items that initially drew husband and wife together, are much in evidence. Drums from Guinea and Mali, as well as a bala, a Malian instrument similar to the xylophone, have transformed one of the two living areas into a music room. The sofa is covered with black, brown and white mud cloth from Mali, and pieces of vividly colored cloth from Nigeria hang against the walls. Also from Nigeria comes a length of pink and green material covered with Arabic lettering -- prayers of praise to God, Mr. Kamara explained.
Given his roots in Sierra Leone, it is not surprising that he often travels back, and is immersed in the country's affairs. Recently, he helped start a secondary school in Dankawalie. And surrounded by these talismans of Sierra Leone, he is embarking on what might be considered the project of a lifetime.
City Lore, an organization that supports urban folk culture, has commissioned him to return to Dankawalie to reconstruct an epic poem handed down by his family for generations. The poem, a series of dramatic tales, reaches back before the birth of the Prophet Muhammad and incorporates the periods of slavery and colonialism in West Africa.
The only known written copy of the poem, which had been set down in Arabic script by his father, was destroyed during the civil war, a time that was devastating for the Kamara family. Dankawalie was burned down, and an uncle, one of many relatives who perished, was said to be the first person killed in the bloodshed that followed.
Mr. Kamara cannot imagine a more meaningful task. ''Stories,'' he said, ''are what hold the community together.''
