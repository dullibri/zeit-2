HEADLINE: The Billionaire Who Didn't Panic

BYLINE: By GRAHAM BOWLEY

 BODY:
Warren E. Buffett has two cardinal rules of investing. Rule No. 1: Never lose money. Rule No. 2: Never forget Rule No. 1.
 Well, a lot of old rules got trashed when the financial crisis struck -- even for the Oracle of Omaha. 
 At 79, Mr. Buffett is coming off the worst year of his long, storied career. On paper, he personally lost an estimated $25 billion in the financial panic of 2008, enough to cost him his title as the world's richest man. (His friend and sometime bridge partner, Bill Gates, now holds that honor, according to Forbes.)
 And yet few people on or off Wall Street have capitalized on this crisis as deftly as Mr. Buffett. After counseling Washington to rescue the nation's financial industry and publicly urging Americans to buy stocks as the markets reeled, in he swooped. Mr. Buffett positioned himself to profit from the market mayhem -- as well as all those taxpayer-financed bailouts -- and thus secure his legacy as one of the greatest investors of all time. 
 When so many others were running scared last autumn, Mr. Buffett invested billions in Goldman Sachs -- and got a far better deal than Washington. He then staked billions more on General Electric. While taxpayers never bailed out Mr. Buffett, they did bail out some of his stock picks. Goldman, American Express, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, U.S. Bancorp -- all of them got public bailouts that ultimately benefited private shareholders like Mr. Buffett.
 If Mr. Buffett picked well -- and, so far, it looks as if he did -- his payoff could be enormous. But now, only a year after the crisis struck, he seems to be worrying that the broader stock market might falter again. After boldly buying when so many were selling assets, his conglomerate, Berkshire Hathaway, is pulling back, buying fewer stocks while investing in corporate and government debt. And Mr. Buffett is warning that the economy, though on the mend, remains deeply troubled. 
 ''We are not out of problems yet,'' Mr. Buffett said last week in an interview, in which he reflected on the lessons of the last 12 months. ''We have got to get the sputtering economy back so it is functioning as it should be.''
 Still, Mr. Buffett hardly sounded shellshocked in the wake of what he once called the financial equivalent of Pearl Harbor. (An estimated net worth of $37 billion would be a balm to anyone's psyche.) 
 ''It has been an incredibly interesting period in the last year and a half. Just the drama,'' Mr. Buffett said. ''Watching the movie has been fun, and occasionally participating has been fun too, though not in what it has done to people's lives.'' 
 Investors big and small hang on Mr. Buffett's pronouncements, and with good reason: if you had invested $1,000 in the stock of Berkshire in 1965, you would have amassed millions of dollars by 2007. 
 Despite that formidable record, the financial crisis dealt him a stinging blow. While he has not changed his value-oriented approach to investing -- he says he likes to buy quality merchandise, whether socks or stocks, at bargain prices -- Buffettologists wonder what will define the final chapters of his celebrated career. 
 In doubt, too, is the future of a post-Buffett Berkshire. The sprawling company, whose primary business is insurance, lost about a fifth of its market value during the last year, roughly as much as the broader stock market. While Berkshire remains a corporate bastion, it lost $1.53 billion during the first quarter, then its top-flight credit rating. It returned to profit during the second quarter. 
 Time is short. While he has no immediate plans to retire, Mr. Buffett is believed to be grooming several possible successors, notably David L. Sokol, chairman of MidAmerican Energy Holdings at Berkshire and also chairman of NetJets, the private jet company owned by Berkshire. 
 After searching in vain for good investments during the bull market years, Mr. Buffett used last year's rout to make investments that could sow the seeds of future profits. 
 Justin Fuller, author of the blog Buffettologist and a partner at Midway Capital Research and Management, said the events of the last year, while painful for many, provided Mr. Buffett with the opportunity he had been waiting for. 
 ''He put a ton of capital to work,'' Mr. Fuller said. ''The crisis gave him the ability to put one last and lasting impression on Berkshire Hathaway.''
 For the moment, however, Mr. Buffett seems to be retrenching a bit. Like so many people, he was blindsided by the blowup in the housing market and the recession that followed, which hammered his holdings of financial and consumer-related companies. He readily concedes he made his share of mistakes. Among his blunders: investing in an energy company around the time oil prices peaked, and in two Irish banks even as that country's financial system trembled. 
 Mr. Buffett declined to predict the short-run course of the stock market. But corporate data from Berkshire shows his company was selling more stocks than it was buying by the end of the second quarter, according to Bloomberg News. Its spending on stocks fell to the lowest level in more than five years, although the company is still deftly picking up shares in some companies and buying corporate and government debt. 
 Among the stocks Mr. Buffett has been selling lately is Moody's, the granddaddy of the much-maligned credit ratings industry. Berkshire, Moody's largest shareholder, said last week that it had reduced its stake by 2 percent. 
 The shift in Berkshire's investments suggests Mr. Buffett is starting to worry, said Alice Schroeder, the author of ''The Snowball,'' a biography of Mr. Buffett.
 But Ms. Schroeder said Mr. Buffett was also growing anxious about how he would be remembered. He wants to remain relevant in the twilight of his career, she said, and is taking a more prominent role on the public stage. That shift means ordinary investors are getting a chance to hear more of his sage advice, but it also carries some risk.
 ''Before, he always made sure to dole out the wisdom with an eyedropper,'' Ms. Schroeder said. In the past, Mr. Buffett ''said it was a mistake to believe that if you are an expert in one area that people will listen to you in others,'' she said. 
 Whatever his recent missteps, many people, from President Obama down, listen to what Mr. Buffett has to say. He is important in his own right as a billionaire businessman but also because millions of ordinary investors follow his homespun aphorisms, copy his investing strategies and await his pronouncements on the markets. 
 Mr. Buffett refused to be drawn out on where stocks are headed, but he warned about the dangers of investing with borrowed money, or leverage, which proved disastrous when the crisis hit. 
 As for regrets, he has a few. His timing was bad, he concedes. He should have sold stocks sooner, before the markets tumbled. Then he served up a Buffettism that any investor might heed: 
 Asked if anything was keeping him awake at night, he said there was not. ''If it's going to keep me awake at night,'' Mr. Buffett said, ''I am not going to go there.''

HEADLINE: It's Time to Get Help

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
Maybe the economic stress has been too much. Looking back at the past few months, it's fair to wonder if the country isn't going through a nervous breakdown.
 The political debate has been poisoned by birthers, deathers and wackos who smile proudly while carrying signs comparing the president to the Nazis. People who don't even know that Medicare is a government program have been trying to instruct us on the best ways to reform health care.
 The administration's most popular anti-recession initiative was a startlingly creative economic breakthrough known as the cash-for-clunkers program. Over the weekend (presumably while the president was sleeping, because this occurred in the wee hours of the morning), White House officials whispered the official announcement that Van Jones would no longer be working in the administration. 
 The White House wishes it had never heard of Mr. Jones, who was hired to be its point person on green jobs. It turns out that Mr. Jones had used a nasty anatomical slur to refer to Republicans and once signed a petition suggesting that George W. Bush had advance knowledge of the Sept. 11 attacks.
 There is no end to the craziness. The entire Republican Party has decided that it is in favor of absolutely nothing. The president's stimulus package? No way. Health care reform? Forget about it.
 There is not a thing you can come up with that the G.O.P. is for. Sunshine in the morning? Harry Reid couldn't persuade a single Senate Republican to vote yes.
 Incredibly, the party's poll numbers are going up.
 We need therapy. President Obama is planning to address the nation's public school students today, urging them to work hard and stay in school. The folks who bray at the moon are outraged. Some of the caterwauling on the right has likened Mr. Obama to Chairman Mao (and, yes, Hitler), and a fair number of parents have bought into the imbecilic notion that this is an effort at socialist or Communist indoctrination.
 As one father from Texas put it: ''I don't want our schools turned over to some socialist movement.''
 The wackiness is increasing, not diminishing, and it has a great potential for destruction. There is a real need for people who know better to speak out in a concerted effort to curb the appeal of the apostles of the absurd.
 But there is another type of disturbing behavior, coming from our political leaders and the public at large, that is also symptomatic of a society at loose ends. We seem unable to face up to many of the hard truths confronting the U.S. as we approach the end of the first decade of the 21st century.
 The Obama administration's biggest domestic priority is health care reform. But the biggest issue confronting ordinary Americans right now -- the biggest by far -- is the devastatingly weak employment environment. Politicians talk about it, but aggressive job-creation efforts are not part of the policy mix.
 Nearly 15 million Americans are unemployed, according to official statistics. The real numbers are far worse. The unemployment rate for black Americans is a back-breaking 15.1 percent. 
 Five million people have been unemployed for more than six months, and the consensus is that even when the recession ends, the employment landscape will remain dismal. A full recovery in employment will take years. With jobless recoveries becoming the norm, there is a real question as to whether the U.S. economy is capable of providing sufficient employment for all who want and need to work.
 This is an overwhelming crisis that is not being met with anything like the urgency required.
 We've also been unable or unwilling to face the hard truths about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the terrible toll they are taking on our young fighting men and women. Most of us don't want to know. Moreover, we've put the costs of these wars on a credit card, without so much as a second thought about what that does to our long-term budget deficits or how it undermines much-needed initiatives here at home.
 There are many other issues that we remain in deep denial about. It's not just the bad economy that has thrown state and local budgets into turmoil from coast to coast. It's our refusal to provide the tax revenues needed to pay for essential public services. Exhibit A is California, which is now a basket case.
 The serious wackos, the obsessive-compulsive absurdists, may be beyond therapy. But the rest of us could use some serious adult counseling. We've forgotten many of the fundamentals: how to live within our means, the benefits of shared sacrifice, the responsibilities that go with citizenship, the importance of a well-rounded education and tolerance.
 The first step, of course, is to recognize that we have a problem.

HEADLINE: Rebuff by Cadbury Doesn't Deter Kraft

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER; Michael J. de la Merced, William Neuman and Andrew Ross Sorkin contributed reporting from New York, and David Jolly from Paris.

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
Determined to become a global food and confectionery giant, Kraft Foods said Monday that it would pursue a $16.7 billion takeover of Cadbury, the British chocolate maker, even after Cadbury rejected that offer as too low.
 Shares of Cadbury soared 41 percent in the day's trading in London, and above the offer price, indicating that investors expected a higher bid from Kraft or a proposal from a rival candy company like Nestle or Hershey. Some analysts said Cadbury could be worth as much as 43 percent more than Kraft offered.
 Combining Kraft, which makes Oreo cookies, Toblerone chocolates and Ritz crackers, with Cadbury's Trident gum and Dairy Milk chocolates would create a giant with $50 billion in yearly revenue, spanning the world from the United States and Mexico to Britain and India. 
 Analysts said that confectionery companies tend to trade at higher values, so adding the chocolate and gum business could enhance Kraft's allure with investors. But Cadbury said that it had reviewed Kraft's proposal, which was made public on Monday, and had rejected it because it ''fundamentally undervalues the group and its prospects.''
 Kraft's chief executive, Irene B. Rosenfeld, has a deep background in food and beverages, and turned around the chips business at PepsiCo before joining Kraft in 2006.
 Nelson W. Peltz and his activist firm, Trian Fund Management, own a stake in Kraft and have nudged it to sell certain assets and bolster the stock price in the past. Mr. Peltz also owns a 3 percent stake in Cadbury and pushed successfully to split off its beverage unit, now known as the Dr Pepper Snapple Group.
 Mr. Peltz declined to comment on Kraft's proposal.
 A takeover of Cadbury would help Kraft, the biggest food conglomerate in North America, compete with its larger rival, Nestle. Cadbury would strengthen Kraft's market share in Britain and open India, where Cadbury is among the most popular chocolate brands. 
 It would also expand Kraft's gum business and give it a global distribution network. Nestle lacks a gum business and is struggling with declining sales as recession-plagued consumers turn away from its bottled water and ice cream.
 Analysts have flagged Cadbury as a potential acquisition for Kraft for several years, but such speculation cooled when Kraft acquired the biscuits and cereal snack unit of France's Danone in 2007.
 Cadbury and Kraft have been doing relatively well in recent months. Cadbury said in February that its confectionery business had proved ''resilient'' despite price increases because of higher commodity costs. Kraft has benefited from rising sales of its convenience foods, like DiGiorno frozen pizza and Oscar Mayer sandwich meats, as consumers eat more meals at home. 
 Among Cadbury's biggest attractions is its chewing gum business, especially in Latin America and Europe, which expanded in 2003 with the acquisition of Adams Confectionery to include Trident and Bubbas bubble gum. Competition then heated up when Mars acquired Wrigley.
 For months, Hershey had been mulling a bid for Cadbury, and it has hired JPMorgan Chase as an adviser, according to people briefed on the matter. Some analysts speculated about a possible joint bid by Nestle and Hershey, allowing Nestle to take Cadbury's gum business to compete with Mars with Hershey taking over the chocolate operation. 
 A Nestle representative declined to comment and pointed to a statement Monday by Paul Bulcke, the chief executive, that Nestle had no plans for major acquisitions in 2009 and 2010.
 The takeover bid could not have come at a worse time for Cadbury's chief executive, Todd Stitzer. The company is halfway through its plan to increase operating profit margins to about 15 percent in 2011, from about 10 percent in 2007. Cadbury's shares have risen about 33 percent since it spun off its Dr Pepper beverage unit in 2008.
 The company, whose roots can be traced to 1824 when John Cadbury opened a shop in Birmingham, England, to sell tea, coffee and, later, cocoa beverages, is not expected to give in easily. It said that it was ''confident in Cadbury's stand-alone strategy and growth prospects as a result of its strong brands, unique category and geographic scope.''
 Speaking in a conference call on Monday, Ms. Rosenfeld of Kraft disagreed. ''Cadbury has limited opportunity as a stand-alone entity in this increasingly competitive environment,'' she said, adding that Kraft ''feels quite confident with the proposal'' and ''looks forward to continuing the dialogue.'' Kraft had not contacted Cadbury investors directly, she said. 
 Ms. Rosenfeld met Cadbury's chairman, Roger Carr, on Aug. 28 to discuss a possible combination, Kraft said in a statement. An exchange of letters followed, but after Cadbury rejected Kraft's proposal, Ms. Rosenfeld decided to make the offer public to encourage further discussions. 
 Under the proposal, Cadbury shareholders would get $:3, or $4.92, in cash and 0.2589 in Kraft Foods shares for each Cadbury share. Kraft said the offer valued the company at $:7.45, or $12.22, a share, a premium of 31 percent over Cadbury's closing price of $:5.68 on Friday. In London, shares rose to $:7.83 on Monday.
 Jeremy Batstone-Carr, an analyst at Charles Stanley in London, called the proposal ''somewhat opportunistic'' and said ''Kraft will need to up its offer to have any serious chance of success, perhaps to 800 pence in cash or higher.'' 
 A report by Sanford C. Bernstein said Kraft was right to go after Cadbury but valued the British company at $:8.55 to $:10.7 a share, based on Wrigley's acquisition of Mars in 2008.
 A takeover would result in an annual pretax cost savings of $625 million in marketing spending, procurement and research and development, Kraft said in a statement. It would result in higher earnings per share, after all transaction-related costs were included, in the second year, Kraft said.
 Kraft said it would finance the deal through debt and was prepared to offer Cadbury shareholders the opportunity to elect, subject to availability, the part they would receive in cash and in new Kraft Foods shares.
 Christopher Growe, a food company analyst with Stifel Nicolaus, applauded the Kraft team. ''Irene has done a great job transforming this company and bringing Kraft to a point where they could build this bigger business,'' he said. ''I don't think Kraft was ready for a transaction of this size a year ago.''
 Lazard is acting as lead financial adviser to Kraft. Centerview Partners, Citigroup and Deutsche Bank are other financial advisers, with Citigroup and Deutsche Bank acting as corporate brokers, providing financing. Cadbury's advisers are UBS, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.

HEADLINE: More Tough Love, a Bit Less Candy

BYLINE: By ROB COX, ALIZA ROSENBAUM and JOHN FOLEY

 BODY:
As the $:10.2 billion ($16.5 billion) hostile bid for Cadbury shows, Kraft Foods' chief executive, Irene Rosenfeld, is gunning for growth. But there's a limit to how far she can go in her quest to acquire the British candy company without sacrificing the well-being of her own long-suffering shareholders.
 As an investment rule of thumb, a company should resist paying a premium for a rival that is greater than the net present value of cost savings that would result from the deal. In the case of Cadbury, Kraft reckons that it can excise about $:386 million ($625 million) of such synergies annually from Cadbury's expenses. 
 After accounting for one-time merger related costs, the total value of those savings to shareholders today would be a little more than $:2 billion after taxes. The trouble is, that does not even cover the $:2.4 billion that Kraft has already offered Cadbury's shareholders over and above its closing share price last Friday.
 That means to justify the deal -- not to mention paying even more now that Cadbury has rejected it -- Kraft needs larger cost cuts. Based on previous deals in the food industry, that should be possible. Kraft is currently talking about chopping expenses worth some 6.5 percent of Cadbury's overall revenue. But if Kraft can match the savings it achieved in its purchase of Nabisco in 2000, the picture improves for its shareholders. 
 In that transaction, Kraft sought expense reductions of about 9 percent of sales. Achieving something similar at Cadbury would bring in an additional $240 million, or $:150 million, in yearly cost savings. That would equate to an extra $:1 billion in net present value, or $:600 million more after covering the premium already on offer. 
 That adds up to about $:7.89 a Cadbury share compared with the $:7.45 in cash and stock on the table. Cadbury closed at $:7.86 on Tuesday. That's still below the price that some analysts think Kraft will need to pay to seal a deal. But it would represent a robust 39 percent premium to Cadbury's share price before Kraft went public with its proposal.
 Kraft says it wants the talks to be friendly. That may be why it has pegged synergies below those achieved in other similar deals. But to keep shareholders sweet, it may need to reveal a little more promise with its cost-cutting scalpel. 
 For Planetary Health 
 When it comes to United States-Chinese imbalances, the environment and the economy are strikingly similar. The meeting of the Group of 20 world leaders in Pittsburgh probably won't do much about either. But they could at least start to recognize that the only fair solution to environmental issues involves joint effort. 
 In economic terms, China and America are interlocked but out of kilter. China produces too much and consumes too little. In America, the reverse is true. 
 There's an environmental parallel. By relying on China's manufacturing, the United States has effectively outsourced its industrial pollution. Together, the two account for more than 40 percent of carbon emissions. But some 70 percent of China's energy is used by industry, while in the United States, consumers account for the same portion. 
 The justifications for inaction on global warming mirror the economic ones. China's politicians want the same right to pollute that America had in its industrial adolescence. Of the world's accumulated carbon emissions, China contributed just 8 percent, versus the United States' 28 percent. American politicians, meanwhile, see the source of future emissions and say there's no point acting before China does. 
 The logjam requires new thinking. Industrialized nations need to acknowledge that it is unrealistic for a transition economy to cap emissions, in effect putting a ceiling on growth. An alternative is for G-20 leaders to push for a widespread global carbon tax that the United States as well as developing nations would pay.
 Second, the cost of cleanup ought to be shared across the rich-developing divide. Jointly financed research is a start, but a big commitment is needed. A Beijing University study suggested reducing China's emissions could cost $438 billion a year. That's a big sum for China, but is just 1 percent of the G-20's G.D.P.
 Whatever the obstacles, both sides must act. The financial crisis may now be starting to recede, but a global warming crisis would be immeasurably more destructive. A percentage point of growth is a small price to pay.

HEADLINE: In South Midtown, There Are Some Relative Bargains in Commercial Rent

BYLINE: By J. ALEX TARQUINIO

 BODY:
In the midst of a sharp downturn for commercial real estate, vacancy rates have soared and asking rents have fallen in all of Manhattan's major office districts. But rents have fallen less steeply in Midtown South, which stretches roughly from 34th Street to Canal Street and includes a diverse mix of neighborhoods, including the Flatiron District, Chelsea and TriBeCa.
 Midtown South is still a relative bargain by Manhattan standards. The average asking rent for Class A space is $51.13 a square foot annually in Midtown South, compared to $68.76 in Midtown, according to Colliers ABR, a commercial real estate services company. But the average asking rent for Class A space is now about 25 percent cheaper in Midtown South than it is in Midtown; a year ago, the discount was 33 percent. 
 Robert L. Sammons, managing director in charge of research for the New York area for Colliers, said the main reason was old-fashioned supply and demand. To be sure, the office vacancy rate has risen in Midtown South, as it has across Manhattan. But there are so few large modern buildings in Midtown South to begin with that relatively little space is available even now.
 Although Midtown South covers a large swath of real estate, it has very little prime office space, which brokers refer to as ''Class A'' space. In fact, brokers consider fewer than two dozen of the office buildings in Midtown South to be Class A. 
 Today, the vacancy rate for Class A space is 7.3 percent in Midtown South versus 12.7 percent in Midtown, according to Cushman & Wakefield, another major commercial real estate concern. 
 Jared Horowitz, a senior director at Cushman & Wakefield, said that in Midtown South, even the Class A buildings tend to have smaller floor plates than Class A buildings in other markets, and an arty look and feel. Although this might not be right for every tenant, he said, ''Midtown South is still a more economic alternative for tenants who want to stay in New York.''
 Although office leasing activity has been slow all across Manhattan in the last year, a few large leases have been signed in Midtown South in recent months. 
 In August, Gap signed a 20-year lease for 265,000 square feet on the 11th through the 16th floors at 40 Worth Street, between Church and West Broadway in TriBeCa. This is the largest office lease signed in Manhattan this year. Gap plans to move employees into the new site from space that it now leases at 620 Avenue of the Americas and 675 Avenue of the Americas. 
 In July, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation signed a 10-year lease for 103,000 square feet on the 12th and 13th floors of the Empire State Building, which is at 350 Fifth Avenue, near 34th Street. In January, the F.D.I.C. will be moving all of its New York staff, some 230 employees, from space that it leases at 20 Exchange Place in Lower Manhattan. 
 Mike Rubino, the F.D.I.C.'s associate director for corporate services in the division of administration, said he had looked for new space in both Midtown and Midtown South, but not in Lower Manhattan. ''Our overriding desire was to get closer to the transportation hub, including Grand Central, Penn Station and the Port Authority,'' he said.
 In a sign of just how much the Manhattan office market has swung in favor of tenants, Mr. Rubino was given about two dozen proposals by landlords, he said. ''We received a very economic rate'' at the Empire State Building, he added.
 The Empire State Building has a lot of empty space now, but that is largely by design, said Anthony E. Malkin, the president of the Wien & Malkin Securities Corporation, which supervises the skyscraper on behalf of the owners: the Malkin family and the Helmsley estate.
 The building has traditionally been occupied by hundreds of small tenants, who tend to pay lower rents. But the landlord has not renewed the leases of many of these small tenants, so as to stitch together large blocks of space.
 Throughout this process, Mr. Malkin has to leave a lot of space vacant, which clearly reduces the amount of rent he collects in the short term. He said that around 45 percent of the 615,000 square feet of space that was now available directly from the landlord was being held in reserve until he could put together whole floors or half-floors. At the moment, five full floors are available: the sixth, 29th, 31st, 61st and 70th floors.
 Mr. Malkin said asking rents in the Empire State Building ranged from the high s$40 to the low s$60 per square foot, with the rents rising on the higher floors. He said the average rent paid by current tenants was $33, up from $26 three years ago, ''which means we still have a lot of tenants paying much less,'' he said.
 Another major building renovation has put a large block of space on the market in Midtown South. The LL Holding Company, which owns 200 Fifth Avenue, a 15-story 850,000-square-foot building, has spent the last two years converting this former toy showroom to offices. 
 The Grey Group, the global advertising company, plans to move in this November as the anchor tenant. Grey signed a lease for 340,000 square feet, from the seventh through the 14th floors, shortly after L & L Holding purchased the building for $480 million in 2007. But then the recession struck, and no other office tenants have signed leases.
 After a gut renovation, the building, which sits opposite the Flatiron Building and Madison Square Park, has 57,000-square-foot floor plates. David W. Levinson, the chairman and chief executive of L & L Holding, said these could easily be divided into 20,000-square-foot blocks. About 340,000 square feet is available: the entire second through sixth floors, and half of the seventh floor.
 Mr. Levinson said that two years ago, when he began marketing the building, he was asking around $80 a square foot, but now it would be significantly less, although he would not be more specific. ''We're prepared to meet the market for a building of this quality,'' he said.

HEADLINE: China and U.S. Company Plan a Big Solar Project

BYLINE: By TODD WOODY

 BODY:
Chinese government officials signed an agreement on Tuesday with First Solar, an American solar developer, for a 2,000-megawatt photovoltaic farm to be built in the Mongolian desert.
 Set for completion in 2019, the First Solar project represents the world's biggest photovoltaic power plant project to date, and is part of an 11,950-megawatt renewable-energy park planned for Ordos City in Inner Mongolia.
 The memorandum of understanding between Chinese officials and First Solar, the world's largest photovoltaic cell manufacturer, would open a potentially vast solar market in China and follows the Chinese government's recent moves to accelerate development of renewable energy. 
 When completed, the Ordos solar farm would generate enough electricity to power about three million Chinese homes, according to First Solar.
 First Solar, based in Tempe, Ariz., is also likely to build a factory in China to make thin-film solar panels, said Mike Ahearn, the company's chief executive. ''It is significant that a non-Chinese company can land something like this in China,'' Mr. Ahearn said in an interview.
 Most proposed large-scale solar projects use solar thermal technology, which deploys mirrors to heat a liquid to create steam that drives an electricity-generating turbine. But as photovoltaic technology becomes more cost-competitive, utilities are turning to companies like First Solar for big solar power farms. Such projects generally have fewer environmental impacts and can be brought online faster than solar thermal plants.
 ''This is nuclear power-size scale,'' Mr. Ahearn said of the China project. ''A two-gigawatt solar project, if this is connected and is economical at the grid level, demonstrates that solar on a large scale really does work.''
 Financial terms of the agreement have yet to be reached and will depend on China completing a feed-in tariff that pays a premium for electricity generated by renewable energy projects. First Solar said the 2,000-megawatt power plant would cost $5 billion to $6 billion if built in the United States today, but it said the cost to build such a project in China would probably be lower. 
 The Ordos agreement is the latest large-scale solar farm deal that First Solar has signed in recent months as it expands its business from manufacturing solar modules to building power plants. The company also has agreed to supply two California utilities with 1,100 megawatts of electricity from three big solar farms.
 ''Discussions with First Solar about building a factory in China demonstrate to investors in China that they can confidently invest in the most advanced technologies available,'' Cao Zhichen, vice mayor of Ordos Municipal Government, said in a statement. 
 Until the announcement of the Ordos project, the largest single photovoltaic power plant was the 550-megawatt Topaz solar farm to be built by First Solar in California. As solar panel prices continue to fall and projects like Ordos bring further economies of scale, photovoltaic farms are expected to become more competitive with solar thermal power plants.
 China is home to a blossoming solar industry thanks to generous government support. But Chinese companies like Suntech, the world's third-largest solar module maker, export most of their products.
 First Solar's cadmium telluride solar cells are less efficient at converting sunlight into electricity than standard crystalline silicon cells made by companies like Suntech but they can be manufactured at a significantly lower cost. 
 ''Given that China has built up homegrown companies like Suntech, it's quite significant that they're importing a U.S. world leader to the marketplace,'' said Nathaniel Bullard, a solar analyst at New Energy Finance, a London market research firm. ''This is going to help ensure technological leadership and not just manufacturing leadership.''
 Suntech formed a venture last year to build solar power plants in the United States and has announced plans to open a factory in the Southwest.
 A high-ranking Chinese official, Wu Bangguo, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China, attended the signing of the First Solar agreement in Arizona on Tuesday. The memorandum of understanding is just the first step in what is likely to be a long and complicated process to build such a gargantuan solar power plant in a country with little experience in constructing such projects.
 ''The ability to predict solar energy yields off these systems to make accurate financial predictions isn't in place yet in China,'' Mr. Ahearn said. 
 Plans for the Ordos renewable energy park call for wind farms to generate 6,950 megawatts, photovoltaic power plants to provide 3,900 megawatts and solar thermal farms to supply 720 megawatts. Biomass operations, fueled by organic materials like wood chips and straw, will contribute 310 megawatts; 70 megawatts will be available from hydro storage, a load-balancing technology that uses off-peak power to pump water to a high reservoir from which it can be released to turn turbines at peak demand periods.
 First Solar will have to establish a supply chain to provide power inverters and other hardware needed for its part of the project as well as train Chinese contractors how to build and operate solar farms. Another hurdle is that China must upgrade its transmission system to connect the solar power plant to the grid. 
 Mr. Ahearn said it was probable that a Chinese utility would ultimately own and run the 16,000-acre solar power plant. 
 The agreement calls for ground to be broken on the first 30-megawatt phase of the project by June 1, 2010, followed by 100-megawatt and 870-megawatt additions to be completed by the end of 2014. A final 1,000-megawatt phase is scheduled to go online by Dec. 31, 2019.

HEADLINE: Commodities Go Up, Dollar Goes Down

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
Investors banking on an economic recovery clamored on Tuesday to buy crude oil, metals and other investments that could benefit once global commerce revives. 
 At the same time, they shunned the dollar, sending it lower against other major currencies. 
 As stocks closed higher, the dollar fell to $1.45 against the euro, its lowest point of the year, as traders bet that worldwide demand for American securities and currency would abate as investors sought better returns in other markets. 
 Gold prices surged briefly above $1,000 an ounce, crude oil rose above $71 a barrel, and prices of raw industrial materials used in factories and foundries, like copper, gained ground.
 Prices of commodities generally soar when inflation is on a high boil and investors want to defend against a weaker dollar. But the latest figures from the government show consumer prices are not rising quickly, personal incomes are nearly flat and an enormous amount of slack still lingers in the economy.
 Nevertheless, investors on Tuesday seemed to bet that a recovery would eventually stoke demand for raw materials and lead to inflation. As the downturn ebbs, investors expect businesses and factories around the world -- especially in China -- to order more goods as they restock inventories.
 ''You're going to have to have metal and resources on hand to restart production,'' said Bart Melek, a commodity strategist at BMO Capital Markets. ''You're going to need supplies. And that's going to lift prices.''
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 56.07 points, or 0.59 percent, to 9,497.34 while the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 8.99 points, or 0.88 percent, to 1,025.39. The Nasdaq rose 18.99 points, or 0.94 percent, to 2,037.77.
 Oil producers and businesses that make basic materials like plastic and metals were among the biggest gainers. The aluminum maker Alcoa, whose shares have fallen by more than half since last September, rose 3.4 percent. Exxon Mobil and Chevron were each up more than 2 percent.
 Crude oil prices, which have been dancing back and forth across the $70 mark, rose $3.08 to $71.10 a barrel, an increase of 4.6 percent. 
 Although unemployment reached 9.7 percent last month, and the American economy continues to lose thousands of jobs every day, economists said that many businesses appeared to be poised to grow again. Corporate profits in the second quarter were better than analysts had expected, manufacturers say their business is picking up, and factory orders for goods are rising after months of steep declines.
 The day's advances in stocks built on gains in Europe and Asia, where markets got a lift from some merger news, as well as a weekend pledge by the world's largest industrial countries to sustain trillions of dollars in economic stimulus programs. Major European markets were up 0.2 to 0.3 percent at the close. Interest rates were slightly higher. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 12/32, to 101 6/32, and the yield rose to 3.48 percent, from 3.44 percent late Friday.
 Following are the results of the Tuesday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills and three-year notes:

HEADLINE: In Michigan, Dream Factories Aim to Replace Auto Sites

BYLINE: By DONNA PAUL

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
In the midst of a recession that has been particularly brutal in Michigan, a number of construction projects are on the verge of getting under way in a most unlikely business: the film industry. 
 The recent surge of interest was set in motion in April 2008, when Gov. Jennifer M. Granholm signed a 14-bill package into law, which among other things provided a 40 percent tax credit or cash rebate for studios on their business tax returns in Michigan. An additional 2 percent rebate is available for films produced in 103 communities.
 There is also a 25 percent infrastructure credit, which is applied against expenditures on construction of a studio and its contents, said Janet Lockwood, director of the Michigan film office.
 Other states, including Louisiana and New Mexico, have enacted similar tax incentives in the last five years, in hopes of generating tax revenue and new jobs. 
 Linden Nelson, 49, chief executive of Nelson Ventures, a private investment company, has started Michigan Motion Picture Studios, doing business as Raleigh Michigan Studios, for $75.8 million. Mr. Nelson, who will be the chief executive of the studio, has formed partnerships with entities controlled by A. Alfred Taubman, the shopping center executive and former chairman of Sotheby's; Raleigh Studios, a large independent film studio in Los Angeles; Walbridge, a private construction company; and William Morris Endeavor, the powerful talent agency. 
 After looking at about 100 abandoned buildings, including an airplane hangar, the Pontiac Silverdome (the former home of the Detroit Lions football team) and vacant auto plants, Mr. Nelson and his partners chose a location within a former General Motors complex in Pontiac. The 22-acre site is surrounded by silent parking lots, barren sidewalks and rarely traveled roads.
 The three-story, 369,000-square-foot building was built in 1999 for $55 million, and 3,000 G.M. truck and bus engineers once worked there. Raleigh's goal is for a similar number of people to be employed at a range of film industry jobs. 
 A master plan by the architects Harley Ellis Devereaux calls for construction of a second 185,000-square-foot building within 20 yards of the existing building. The new building will hold seven sound stages, ranging from 12,000 to 30,000 square feet. An existing annex with 22-foot-high ceilings, which was used as offices by G.M., will be converted into two studios to make TV shows.
 Finishing labs, animation and executive offices will be housed in the main building. ''Part of the appeal of the building was its condition,'' Mr. Nelson said. ''We felt it was tailor-made for our purposes.'' 
 Raleigh Michigan Studios is hoping to have a groundbreaking later this month. The office building is to be ready for occupancy within 45 to 60 days after that, and the new stages are to be built in another nine or 10 months. 
 Another project that owes its existence to the tax incentive legislation is Unity Studios in Allen Park, Mich., where a groundbreaking was held in August. These newly established studios are to be headed by Jimmy Lifton, 54, a Detroit native, who has been president of Oracle Post, a postproduction studio with California facilities in Burbank and Santa Monica, since 1981. 
 He plans to convert a 104-acre site in Allen Park into a full-fledged movie studio. Of those acres, 70 are already developed, including a 600,000-square-foot office building that was formerly occupied by the Visteon Corporation, a global manufacturer of automotive parts, with Ford as its largest customer. Until early 2005, 2,200 employees worked there. 
 Another 160,000-square-foot building that was started by Visteon but never finished will become soundstages and production offices. 
 The site, which was acquired for $24.8 million, is to be transformed into Unity Studios over five years at a total cost of $146 million, following a master plan by Hobbs & Black Associates of Ann Arbor. 
 Within the main building, the first phase is expected to be finished by the end of this year. It includes classrooms, a computer lab, a construction mill to build sets and four soundstages totaling 48,000 square feet. There will be a screening room, an array of mixing stages and editing bays.
 Mr. Lifton is also creating the Lifton Institute for Media Skills, a state-licensed school for training ''below the line talent,'' which in film parlance means technical jobs. It is expected to enroll 250 students.
 As part of the master plan, a residential village is to be built during the final phases. It is expected to consist of multipurpose buildings with retailing on the ground floors and loft and town house residences. Mr. Lifton anticipates that people who work at Unity will live there, but the residences will not be limited to studio employees. ''I wanted to put together a creative community, and I hope there will be a tax incentive too for people to live there,'' he said.
 The site is at the intersection of several highways and is a 10-minute drive from the Detroit Metro airport and .less than five miles from the renowned Ford Rouge plant, the giant 1930s-era factory. 
 Mr. Lifton sees it as inspiration. ''Under one roof someone can come up with an idea and at the end there is a finished product,'' he said. ''I like the idea of a soup-to-nuts operation.''
 Mr. Lifton said he expected the studio to turn out seven feature films ''within the first year of operation'' after the first phase of construction was completed. 
 The city of Allen Park, population 30,000, has formed an alliance with Unity Studios in hopes of spurring job creation. The land and buildings were purchased with $31 million of bonds issued by the city of Allen Park. ''There is zero money for start-up companies now,'' said Allen Park's mayor, Gary Burtka. ''You need government help.'' 
 Another film-related project involves Michele Richards, 47, a Detroit native who lives in Los Angeles, where she is an executive producer of television and video games.
 Her plan calls for a company to be called Wonderstruck Studios, which would create an $86 million facility with four soundstages, screening rooms and postproduction facilities. She has been awarded an infrastructure tax credit of $11.7 million. 
 The studio will specialize in full-service digital animation and visual effects. There will be 413 full-time employees who will produce feature films, television shows and video games.
 Ms. Richards spent eight months negotiating a deal with the MGM Grand, from whom she tried to purchase a former casino in downtown Detroit that has been vacant since late 2007. Last month, she withdrew from that deal and began looking at other sites in downtown Detroit.
 ''I am committed to staying in downtown Detroit,'' Ms. Richards said. She hopes to find a site and have work under way by the end of the year, with production planned to begin in 2010 with about 60 employees.

 CORRECTION:
An article on the Square Feet pages on Wednesday about planned film studios in Michigan misidentified the developer of an unfinished 160,000-square-foot building in Allen Park, which is to form part of Unity Studios. Samir A. Danou, a local developer, began the project -- not the Visteon Corporation.

HEADLINE: The Crisis, a Year Later

 BODY:
With the one-year anniversary of the financial collapse now at hand, there is general agreement that the government's bailouts and other interventions prevented a bad situation from becoming much worse. 
 The form and scale of the various rescues is still a matter of legitimate debate. But there is no doubt that the government has, for now, stabilized the financial system. Though credit remains seriously impaired, it is slowly becoming more plentiful and less expensive -- a hopeful sign that the worst of the recession may be over. 
 Still, the results are nothing to crow about. Despite recent reports that the government is making money on the bank bailout, there is, as yet, nothing to suggest that the financial system is ready to function without vast government intervention -- or that the costs to taxpayers will be anything but enormous. 
 Calculations compiled for The New York Times show that the government has collected profits of $4 billion from eight of the biggest banks that have fully repaid their obligations under the Treasury's main bailout program -- a return of about 15 percent annually. Calculations reported in The Wall Street Journal showed that the Treasury made $5 billion from 34 firms that repaid bailout money, for a 7 percent annualized rate of return. 
 That's better than losing money on any given transaction. But the big picture is bleak. Estimates by Moody's Economy.com, presented in recent Congressional testimony, suggest that of the $12 trillion the government has committed to fight the financial crisis and recession, the final tab to taxpayers will approach $1.2 trillion. That is equal to about 8 percent of the size of the economy. For comparison, the savings-and-loan crisis of the early 1990s ultimately cost taxpayers some $250 billion in today's dollars, or about 3 percent of the size of the economy. 
 Worse, there is still much that the public does not know about the rescues. The Treasury still does not require banks to specify how they are using their bailout dollars, despite recommendations from the bailout's special inspector general that the government demand a periodic accounting. Lawmakers and the public have no precise information about the roughly $300 billion in Citigroup assets that the government has guaranteed. Nor has there been an airing of the terms of the derivatives contracts that the government paid off in the bailout of the American International Group. 
 Without such data, it's impossible to truly assess the bailouts' efficacy or to be confident that the right reforms will be put in place to ensure this disaster doesn't recur. And while it's possible to say, in the moment, that conditions in the financial system have improved, it is hard to believe that there is anything ahead for the economy other than a very long, hard road to recovery.

HEADLINE: At Colleges, Too Few Diplomas

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: leonhardt@nytimes.com

 BODY:
If you were going to come up with a list of organizations whose failures had done the most damage to the American economy in recent years, you'd probably have to start with the Wall Street firms and regulatory agencies that brought us the financial crisis. From there, you might move on to Wall Street's fellow bailout recipients in Detroit, the once-Big Three.
 But I would suggest that the list should also include a less obvious nominee: public universities.
 At its top levels, the American system of higher education may be the best in the world. Yet in terms of its core mission -- turning teenagers into educated college graduates -- much of the system is simply failing. 
 Only 33 percent of the freshmen who enter the University of Massachusetts, Boston, graduate within six years. Less than 41 percent graduate from the University of Montana, and 44 percent from the University of New Mexico. The economist Mark Schneider refers to colleges with such dropout rates as ''failure factories,'' and they are the norm. 
 The United States does a good job enrolling teenagers in college, but only half of students who enroll end up with a bachelor's degree. Among rich countries, only Italy is worse. That's a big reason inequality has soared, and productivity growth has slowed. Economic growth in this decade was on pace to be slower than in any decade since World War II -- even before the financial crisis started. 
 So identifying the causes of the college dropout crisis matters enormously, and a new book tries to do precisely that. 
 It is called ''Crossing the Finish Line,'' and its findings are based on the records of about 200,000 students at 68 colleges. The authors were able to get their hands on that data because two of them are pillars of the education establishment: William Bowen (an economist and former Princeton president) and Michael McPherson (an economist and former Macalester College president). 
 For all the book's alarming statistics, its message is ultimately uplifting -- or at least invigorating. 
 Yes, inadequate precollege education is a problem. But high schools still produce many students who have the skills to complete college and yet fail to do so. Turning them into college graduates should be a lot less difficult than fixing all of American education. 
 ''We could be doing a lot better with college completion just by working on our colleges,'' as Robert Shireman, an Education Department official who has read an early version of the book, says.
 Congress and the Obama administration are now putting together an education bill that tries to deal with the problem. It would cancel about $9 billion in annual government subsidies for banks that lend to college students and use much of the money to increase financial aid. A small portion of the money would be set aside for promising pilot programs aimed at lifting the number of college graduates. All in all, the bill would help.
 But it won't solve the system's biggest problems -- the focus on enrollment rather than completion, the fact that colleges are not held to account for their failures. ''Crossing the Finish Line'' makes it clear that we can do better.
 The first problem that Mr. Bowen, Mr. McPherson and the book's third author, Matthew Chingos, a doctoral candidate, diagnose is something they call under-matching. It refers to students who choose not to attend the best college they can get into. They instead go to a less selective one, perhaps one that's closer to home or, given the torturous financial aid process, less expensive. 
 About half of low-income students with a high school grade-point average of at least 3.5 and an SAT score of at least 1,200 do not attend the best college they could have. Many don't even apply. Some apply but don't enroll. ''I was really astonished by the degree to which presumptively well-qualified students from poor families under-matched,'' Mr. Bowen told me. 
 They could have been admitted to Michigan's Ann Arbor campus (graduation rate: 88 percent, according to College Results Online) or Michigan State (74 percent), but they went, say, to Eastern Michigan (39 percent) or Western Michigan (54 percent). If they graduate, it would be hard to get upset about their choice. But large numbers do not. You can see that in the chart with this column.
 In effect, well-off students -- many of whom will graduate no matter where they go -- attend the colleges that do the best job of producing graduates. These are the places where many students live on campus (which raises graduation rates) and graduation is the norm. Meanwhile, lower-income students -- even when they are better qualified -- often go to colleges that excel in producing dropouts.
 ''It's really a waste,'' Mr. Bowen says, ''and a big problem for the country.'' As the authors point out, the only way to lift the college graduation rate significantly is to lift it among poor and working-class students. Instead, it appears to have fallen somewhat since the 1970s.
 What can be done?
 Money is clearly part of the answer. Tellingly, net tuition has no impact on the graduation rates of high-income students. Yet it does affect low-income students. All else equal, they are less likely to make it through a more expensive state college than a less expensive one, the book shows. Conservatives are wrong to suggest affordability doesn't matter.
 But they are right that more money isn't the whole answer. Higher education today also suffers from a deep cultural problem. Failure has become acceptable. 
 Students see no need to graduate in four years. Doing so, as one told the book's authors, is ''like leaving the party at 10:30 p.m.'' Graduation delayed often becomes graduation denied. Administrators then make excuses for their graduation rates. And policy makers hand out money based on how many students a college enrolls rather than on what it does with those students.
 There is a real parallel here to health care. We pay doctors and hospitals for more care instead of better care, and what do we get? More care, even if in many cases it doesn't make us healthier. 
 In education, the incentives can be truly perverse. Because large lecture classes are cheaper for a college than seminars, freshmen are cheaper than upperclassmen. So a college that allows many of its underclassmen to drop out may be helping its bottom line.
 If you look closely, you can still find reasons for optimism. A few colleges, like the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, have intensive programs that have raised graduation rates. The State of West Virginia has begun tying student aid to academic progress, and graduation rates there have risen. Washington Monthly magazine has published a new college ranking based in part on graduation rates. (Kudos to Penn State, among others.) When students fill out an online form for federal financial aid, the Obama Education Department now informs them of the graduation rate at any college in which they express interest. 
 But an enormous amount of work remains, and it's hard to think of any work that's more important to the American economy.
 Last year, even in the grip of a recession that has spared no group of workers, the gap between what a college graduate earned and what everyone else earned reached a record. Workers with bachelor's degrees made 54 percent more on average than those who attended college but didn't finish, according to the Labor Department. Fifty-four percent -- just think about how that adds up over a lifetime. And then think about how many students never cross the college finish line.

HEADLINE: Consumer Borrowing Fell A Record Amount in July

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Consumers slashed their borrowing in July by the largest amount on record as job losses and uncertainty about the economic recovery prompted Americans to rein in their debt, the Federal Reserve reported Tuesday. 
 The magnitude of the drop surprised analysts. Some thought the cash-for-clunkers program -- which began in July and aided auto sales and car loans -- would have blunted cutbacks in other lending areas.
 The Fed said consumers ratcheted back their credit by a larger-than-anticipated $21.6 billion from June, the most on record dating to 1943. Economists had expected credit to drop by $4 billion.
 Demand for nonrevolving credit used to finance cars, vacations, education and other things fell by $15.4 billion, also a record decline. That 11.7 percent pace was on top of an 8 percent annualized decline in June.
 Consumers' appetite for revolving credit, primarily credit cards, declined by $6.1 billion in July, an annualized rate of 8 percent that followed a 6.4 percent drop in June.
 Economists predict that consumers will be spending less, saving more and trimming debt to get their household finances -- which have been decimated by the recession -- into better shape.
 July's retreat translated into an annualized decline of 10.4 percent. That followed a cut of $15.5 billion in June, or a 7.4 percent annualized drop, and the most since a 16.3 percent decline in June 1975.
 The latest cut left total consumer credit at $2.47 trillion.

HEADLINE: 11th-Hour Filings Oppose Google's Book Settlement

BYLINE: By MIGUEL HELFT

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
After a flurry of last-minute filings on Tuesday, a federal judge must now begin untangling the mountain of competing claims about how a legal settlement granting Google the right to create the world's largest digital library and bookstore would affect competition, authors' rights and readers' privacy. 
 The $125 million proposed settlement among Google, the Authors Guild and the Association of American publishers, which is awaiting review by Judge Denny Chin of the Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York, has prompted dozens of opposing filings from individuals, rival companies like Amazon and Microsoft, advocacy organizations, groups representing authors and publishers and even some foreign governments. 
 It has also received the support of companies like Sony, civil rights groups and some antitrust and economics experts in academia. 
 Legal scholars say that Judge Chin will have to address not only whether the settlement is fair to the authors, publishers and rights holders covered by it, but also whether it benefits the public at large. 
 ''The number and quality of opposition filings is very unusual,'' said Jay Tidmarsh, a professor of law at Notre Dame Law School. ''The court is going to have to look at the public interest in the settlement.''
 The agreement, which would bring millions of rarely seen books online, has clear benefits to readers and authors. But scholars say the judge is likely to weigh those benefits against arguments that the settlement would limit competition. Opponents say it would give Google a quasi-exclusive license to profit from millions of out-of-print books and create a consortium that would have power to set prices for digital books. Google, the Authors Guild and the Association of American Publishers have vigorously disputed those claims, but the claims are being investigated by the Justice Department. 
 Opponents have raised other issues including contending that the settlement tramples on the rights of some authors and that it does not protect the privacy of readers. The court has the power to either approve or strike down the settlement, an option that would revive the lawsuits filed in 2005 by the authors and publishers against Google over its plan to digitize millions of books from libraries without authorization from rights holders. But if Judge Chin finds problems with the settlement, he could also offer the parties a road map for overcoming them.
 ''If the judge has some significant concerns, it is much more likely that he would invite the parties to address those concerns rather than reject the agreement,'' said Andrew I. Gavil, a law professor at Howard University. Professor Gavil said that Judge Chin was likely to give special consideration to the opinion of the Justice Department, which has until Sept. 18 to make its views known. A hearing on the settlement is scheduled for Oct. 7.
 On Tuesday, several groups filed briefs in opposition, including Microsoft and Yahoo, and a coalition representing those companies and others. The coalition, which calls itself the Open Book Alliance, opposes the agreement on antitrust grounds. The group is co-led by Gary Reback, an antitrust attorney in Silicon Valley who in the 1990s helped persuade the Justice Department to file its landmark antitrust case against Microsoft. He said the court could address some of the antitrust objections by forcing Google to license its database of digital books to others. 
 ''Google should be ordered to license the database with all attendant rights to a number of competitors, under the supervision of the Justice Department,'' Mr. Reback wrote in the brief. He traced the birth of Silicon Valley to a similar ''compulsory license'' mandated by the Justice Department. ''Silicon Valley exists precisely because the Antitrust Division ordered AT&T to license its key invention, the transistor, for nominal payments,'' he wrote. 
 Defenders of the agreement say the antitrust concerns are unfounded, and argue that others besides Google could obtain similar licenses without any mandates from the court.
 ''We have never said that the same kinds of outcomes would not be available to Microsoft or Amazon or anyone else who is willing to make the same investments,'' said Richard Sarnoff, former chairman of the Association of American Publishers and co-chairman of the American unit of Bertelsmann, the parent company of Random House. ''We have a road map to do it now.''

HEADLINE: Obama's Audience Speaks First

BYLINE: By ANNA DEAVERE SMITH

 BODY:
Over the last few years, in preparation for a new play, I interviewed doctors, patients and healers about the human body, its resilience and its vulnerability. Although our conversations were not primarily about the health care debate, they do reveal many of the feelings and thoughts of the people in the audience President Obama will address tonight.
 The unruliness that now animates the conversation stems from our passions, hopes and discomforts -- about life, death, who should (or should not) take care of us and whom we should take care of. The president's audience has a million and one perspectives, some of them clumping together like blood platelets under one political roof or another. The following excerpts (not all of which are in my play) reflect the range of views. 
 I personally think we need to go to a deal like when I broke my back and I went to the military hospital ... Brooke Army Medical Center, in San Antonio, Tex. Cost me a flat rate, $1,200 a day, and I spent the first six days in I.C.U. Everyone, everyone pays a flat rate, no matter what it is. I got hung up by a bull [that] weighed over a ton. ...When I hit the ground, I was on my side and he stepped on my left side with two back feet, broke four ribs, L2, L3 [lumbar vertebrae], and lost half my kidney. And them doctors, I felt, like -- well, they told me, if I'd have went to the other hospital in San Antone, they'd have just taken my kidney out. They tried a new deal. They put a stent in there. But them guys get paid a flat rate; it's not like they're trying to rape me to make more money to pay their Mercedes-Benz bills or whatever they got.
 Phil Pizzo, the dean of the Stanford School of Medicine
 We can't afford to have a system like this. The cultural expectation is that we are in a community where the public -- every individual -- believes that she or he should get the most advanced health care kind of on demand. And the notion that it wouldn't be, that is sort of anathema and we've grown toward that over the years. 
 I can remember as a child -- so this was growing up in the 1950s when doctors made house calls -- when the doctor came to my house and did an examination, if the doctor didn't do something, you know, give a shot or give the medication ... it was as if they'd never come. Why did we call you if you didn't do something? What are our expectations as individuals and as society about what constitutes reasonable care? 
 Anonymous nurse, Western United States
 When you come to the West, you have a different mentality. There's an independence and an individuality here that you don't get anyplace else, because when you're in the city, you're kind of like part of the hive. You know, people that take the light rail in to work and come back and live in these big apartment buildings and have restaurants and things and they're fine with that. 
 Here, people are really, really proud, and they cherish their independence. And they cherish the fact that we are all individuals. And that's what we're afraid of, is that we're going to lose our individuality and we're just going to be part of the hive. If you're just part of the hive, then what are you going to do? You're going to cull out the weak links. You're going to cull out the lady that's on crutches and got diabetes, because she may be a good grandmother and she may be a good person, she lives by herself, and her house is paid for, but you know, her medicines cost a lot. 
 Adam, a ''patriot'' from Grand Junction, Colo.
 Our founding fathers went to war to throw out tyranny, to overthrow a tyrannical government without proper representation. We are about at that point now. We're here to say we want our country back. Health care ... is socialism. And socialism is not an American value. ... No, I do not have health insurance. I've never had insurance. [If I need medical care] I should pay for it. I've been to the doctor one time since I was 12 years old. I paid the full bill. ... If I truly needed, had a medical need, I have a catastrophic plan that I bought. But it just covers something that's truly catastrophic. Has a huge deductible. And if that came about I would pay that. You know, you don't look for a handout. 
 Asghar Rastegar, a nephrologist at Yale-New Haven Hospital
 We have become much better in diagnosis. We can look inside cells. We can look inside genes. We could never do that 20 years ago. We can define diseases with such power. But [we lack] the -- it's the realization that there is a human being, fully developed, sitting across who has his or her own dreams, has his or her own beliefs, wishes, desires. And they're being ravaged by disease. It's not the disease. And so we often are caught [up] with technology and miss the fact that there is an individual who has his own wishes, hopes, dreams, that plays into their ability to defend themselves against the illness and recover. 
 Bill Tasche,a hiking guide in Big Sur, Calif.
 We don't go to doctors. I'm physically strong as an ox, but I'm spiritually strong. We do a lot of herbs and we put them in a Vita-Mix. Everything I see in the woods, horsetail, dandelion, we pull them up. We put them in a Vita-Mix! And we juice them up and we drink it. Pure chlorophyll. We do a lot of that. I do a lot of Vitamin C. I do 10,000 units of C. You know, Linus Pauling used to live here and he's the one who got me into doing 10,000 units of Vitamin C a day. I do a lot of minerals. You must do minerals. But that chlorophyll drink's the best I take. Barley green, barley by the handfuls! 
 I walked 20 miles, what, last week? And I wasn't even fazed, not even fazed. And these guys were, ''Bill, this is challenging!'' Listen, I'm 67. I can do it, you can do it. I thought they were going to turn back on me. I said, ''No, no, no, we got to go forward now! We can't go back!''
 Peter Orszag, the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget
 A key question is how do we move towards a different norm both for providers and for beneficiaries so that when you go to the doctor you're not just asking for more of everything, if that's not going to make you better. It's not just incentives. Norms sound fuzzy, but I think they're crucial.
 How do you adjust norms? ... Take seat belts versus speeding. You get a ticket if you don't use your seat belt or if you're speeding, and so the pure Econ 101 approach would suggest the penalty for not obeying is similar, and yet adherence to seat belt laws seems much higher, in part because at least for those in the front seat, the norm has changed. When you get in a car, if there's a passenger in a car, you sort of, at least I do, I kind of look over if a passenger in the front seat doesn't put on their seat belt. You don't quite do the same thing if you are in the front seat and the driver is speeding.
 And how does that develop? There was a concerted effort to try to encourage seat belt use. So similarly [in health care] part of what needs to happen is not just public policy ... but an emphasis on healthy living, and helping people do what they say they want to do, which is eat better and exercise more and be healthier. That's going to be gradual evolution too, but the norm setting I think is important.
 Jim Logue, a health care rally attendee from Grand Junction, Colo. 
 My wife works at St. Mary's Hospital here 18 years. I got sicker than a dog last year about this time -- 104-degree temperature. I was freezing, go to the hospital, talked to the triage, boy nurse.
 I said: ''Look, buddy, your lobby is full of illegals and park bums. They're bouncing off the wall. I'm dying here. My wife's been working here 18 years. I got the same insurance you got.'' He said, ''Well, you got to wait behind the rest of them.'' I said: ''Let me get this straight -- not only am I buying all their health care, and I got to stand behind them too? There's something wrong with that.'' 
 Bill Robinson,a doctor in Bozeman, Mont.
 American culture simply has never been based on caring about what happened to your neighbor. It's been based on individual freedom and the spirit of, if I work hard I'll get what I need and I don't have to worry about [the] fellow that maybe can't work hard. It's a pretty cynical view of America. 
 But I honestly think that drives an awful lot of this debate -- the notion that I've done my job, I've worked hard, I've gotten what I'm supposed to get. I have what I need and if the other people don't, then that's sort of their problem. And unfortunately the big picture -- that our nation can't thrive with such a disparity between the rich and the poor, the access people and the disenfranchised -- that hasn't seemed to really strike a chord with Americans.
 So your average person actually has fairly good access. They're happy with their physician and they're really frightened that something's going to happen to that, on behalf of people that maybe they don't think it's their job to take care of. 
 Fernando Mendoza,a professor of pediatrics at Stanford School of Medicine
 Much of what I have done in my professional career is looking at health care in Latino children. Clearly they don't have health care. Issues of obesity -- I had been working with my colleagues on national health surveys. And actually we did some of the surveys that were done in the '70s and the early '80s. It was clear from back then that Latino kids had what we call a short plump syndrome, which was they were a little shorter and they were ... heavier than the U.S. population. But African-American kids were also larger. And it was not until 1990 when they sampled enough Mexicans, enough African-Americans to really get numbers. It doesn't become an issue, unless it becomes an issue in the white kids.
 Stu Katz,a cardiologist at Yale-New Haven Hospital
 When I was at Columbia we had a wealthy Turkish man come to the United States seeking a heart transplant. ... He was just going to pay cash. And so he said, ''Well, how much does it cost?'' And we told him, you know, $250,000, and he started laughing. And you know, going through a translator. So we said, ''Why are you laughing?'' And he said, ''That's less than a Ferrari.''

HEADLINE: All-Star Event Planned

BYLINE: By LYNN ZINSER

 BODY:
After eight months on the job as the ATP Tour's chief executive, Adam Helfant said he believed that men's tennis does not need an overhaul or even serious tinkering. It is riding a wave of success created by a dynamic set of top players, Helfant said, and that the best thing the tour could do was market that success better. 
 That's why the first big initiative of Helfant's tenure will be an all-star event in the days leading to the tournament in Indian Wells, Calif., in March. It will most likely include skills competitions, celebrity doubles matches and an awards show, a made-for-TV extravaganza reminiscent of an N.B.A. or N.H.L. All-Star weekend.
 ''We've talked to our players about it and our players are excited about it and committed to it,'' Helfant said Tuesday at a news conference.
 Helfant envisions an event that appeals to a wider audience, something that adds a little glamour to attract casual fans and attention from what he called ''lifestyle media.''
 In his first major remarks at the Open, Helfant sought to strike an upbeat tone about the health of the tour, which lost its major sponsor, Mercedes, because of the recession and has not yet signed a replacement. He said that the tour had been hurt, like others had, by the downturn in corporate hospitality, but that overall attendance was ''flat to slightly up'' and that sponsorship as a whole had held up well. He cited 14 tournaments that either signed new sponsorship agreements or renewed old ones, compared with one tournament that had lost a title sponsor.
 In talking to players, Helfant has fielded complaints about the length of the season and the crowding of major events into particular stretches, but he said he envisioned no major changes for next year. Rafael Nadal, for one, has voiced concerns that the schedule has taken its toll on players. Nadal was forced off the tour for nine weeks because of knee tendinitis.
 Helfant said he hoped giving top players byes in early matches of some tournaments and going to best-of-three instead of best-of-five matches in nonmajors had addressed their concerns about the wear-and-tear factors of such a crowded schedule.
 ''We should be careful not to overstate issues with the calendar; there will always be an issue with the calendar,'' Helfant said. ''We are going to look to refine it, but you shouldn't expect anything significant or dramatic for next year.''

HEADLINE: Our One-Party Democracy

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
Watching both the health care and climate/energy debates in Congress, it is hard not to draw the following conclusion: There is only one thing worse than one-party autocracy, and that is one-party democracy, which is what we have in America today.
 One-party autocracy certainly has its drawbacks. But when it is led by a reasonably enlightened group of people, as China is today, it can also have great advantages. That one party can just impose the politically difficult but critically important policies needed to move a society forward in the 21st century. It is not an accident that China is committed to overtaking us in electric cars, solar power, energy efficiency, batteries, nuclear power and wind power. China's leaders understand that in a world of exploding populations and rising emerging-market middle classes, demand for clean power and energy efficiency is going to soar. Beijing wants to make sure that it owns that industry and is ordering the policies to do that, including boosting gasoline prices, from the top down. 
Our one-party democracy is worse. The fact is, on both the energy/climate legislation and health care legislation, only the Democrats are really playing. With a few notable exceptions, the Republican Party is standing, arms folded and saying ''no.'' Many of them just want President Obama to fail. Such a waste. Mr. Obama is not a socialist; he's a centrist. But if he's forced to depend entirely on his own party to pass legislation, he will be whipsawed by its different factions.
 Look at the climate/energy bill that came out of the House. Its sponsors had to work twice as hard to produce this breakthrough cap-and-trade legislation. Why? Because with basically no G.O.P. representatives willing to vote for any price on carbon that would stimulate investments in clean energy and energy efficiency, the sponsors had to rely entirely on Democrats -- and that meant paying off coal-state and agriculture Democrats with pork. Thank goodness, it is still a bill worth passing. But it could have been much better -- and can be in the Senate. Just give me 8 to 10 Republicans ready to impose some price on carbon, and they can be leveraged against Democrats who want to water down the bill.
 ''China is going to eat our lunch and take our jobs on clean energy -- an industry that we largely invented -- and they are going to do it with a managed economy we don't have and don't want,'' said Joe Romm, who writes the blog, climateprogress.org. 
 The only way for us to match them is by legislating a rising carbon price along with efficiency and renewable standards that will stimulate massive private investment in clean-tech. Hard to do with a one-party democracy. 
 The same is true on health care. ''The central mechanism through which Obama seeks to extend coverage and restrain costs is via new 'exchanges,' insurance clearinghouses, modeled on the plan Mitt Romney enacted when he was governor of Massachusetts,'' noted Matt Miller, a former Clinton budget official and author of ''The Tyranny of Dead Ideas.'' ''The idea is to let individuals access group coverage from private insurers, with subsidies for low earners.''
 And it is possible the president will seek to fund those subsidies, at least in part, with the idea John McCain ran on -- by reducing the tax exemption for employer-provided health care. Can the Republicans even say yes to their own ideas, if they are absorbed by Obama? Without Obama being able to leverage some Republican votes, it is going to be very hard to get a good plan to cover all Americans with health care.
 ''Just because Obama is on a path to give America the Romney health plan with McCain-style financing, does not mean the Republicans will embrace it -- if it seems politically more attractive to scream 'socialist,' '' said Miller.
 The G.O.P. used to be the party of business. Well, to compete and win in a globalized world, no one needs the burden of health insurance shifted from business to government more than American business. No one needs immigration reform -- so the world's best brainpower can come here without restrictions -- more than American business. No one needs a push for clean-tech -- the world's next great global manufacturing industry -- more than American business. Yet the G.O.P. today resists national health care, immigration reform and wants to just drill, baby, drill.
 ''Globalization has neutered the Republican Party, leaving it to represent not the have-nots of the recession but the have-nots of globalized America, the people who have been left behind either in reality or in their fears,'' said Edward Goldberg, a global trade consultant who teaches at Baruch College. ''The need to compete in a globalized world has forced the meritocracy, the multinational corporate manager, the eastern financier and the technology entrepreneur to reconsider what the Republican Party has to offer. In principle, they have left the party, leaving behind not a pragmatic coalition but a group of ideological naysayers.''

HEADLINE: Pentagon Checks Arsenal In Race for Nuclear Treaty

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER and MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
With the clock ticking on a year-end deadline, President Obama is pressing ahead with a top-to-bottom review of America's nuclear weapons to see how much the arsenal can shrink, as his negotiators are racing to wrap up a major new strategic arms control treaty with Russia.
 The review, in tandem with reinvigorated talks between Washington and Moscow, will help determine how much further the two nuclear superpowers will cut their arsenals after the 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or Start, expires Dec. 5.
 The last time the Pentagon reviewed its nuclear posture, in 2001, it concluded that the American military could get by with 1,700 to 2,200 nuclear warheads at the ready, a level the Bush administration found comfortable even as it demurred over a binding treaty with Russia. 
 Now both sides want to go even lower. Russia is especially eager to lock in reductions, and Mr. Obama has made deep cuts a primary diplomatic goal. Their ambitions, and the impending deadline, make the Pentagon's review crucial, because it would help determine the bottom line, as well as which missiles, bombers and submarines to keep, how much to spend modernizing them and the implications of a changing world where small states, too, can acquire nuclear arms.
 But not everybody is at ease with the prospect of such rapid change. Several officials involved in the effort said powerful constituencies -- among arms specialists in the executive branch, Congress, the military and at the weapons laboratories -- had conflicting views of how to proceed. 
 Although Mr. Obama has vowed that his long-term goal is eliminating nuclear weapons, there are significant disagreements about how fast and how deep reductions might be made while guaranteeing America's security in a world in which other nations maintain nuclear arsenals, others might be tempted to build them -- and bomb-making knowledge can never be erased.
 The shape of the arsenal also is a point of contention. Some military planners advocate building a new generation of safer and more reliable warheads, while some administration officials fear that reopening nuclear assembly lines would undermine their efforts at nonproliferation.
 The arms talks must deal not only with the limit on warheads, a ceiling that might be as low as 1,500 on each side, but also with arcane counting rules, verification measures and ancillary issues like the deployment of missile defenses.
 Tackling these extraordinarily complex issues at the same time on a tight schedule is an ambitious agenda, especially for an administration also trying to battle a deep economic crisis, overhaul the health care system and address global climate change.
 ''From a distance, it could look like, 'How do you do all that?' '' said Ellen O. Tauscher, the under secretary of state for arms control and international security. ''It's like the operation of a very high-end restaurant kitchen. It may look chaotic, but beautiful things come out of it.''
 Senior Defense Department officials said the nation's entire nuclear weapons architecture was under review, including such fundamental traditions as whether the nation still needs to maintain a triad of land-based missiles, submarine-launched missiles and bombers.
 Mr. Obama laid out his vision in April, declaring in Prague that he would ''reduce the role of nuclear weapons'' and urge other countries to do the same, with the long-term goal of eliminating nuclear arms altogether.
 Under a framework agreement signed in Moscow this summer by Mr. Obama and his Russian counterpart, Dmitri A. Medvedev, the new treaty is to reduce the ceiling on long-range nuclear warheads to 1,500 to 1,675 within seven years, down from the current limit of 2,200 by 2012, under the separate Moscow Treaty signed in 2002. 
 Total American warheads reached more than 32,000 in the 1960s but dropped to 10,500 just before Start was signed in 1991. This year, the Federation of American Scientists reported that the United States had already reduced its deployed strategic nuclear warheads to 2,200, more than three years ahead of the Moscow Treaty schedule.
 Under the prospective new treaty, to be negotiated by December with follow-up talks to look at even deeper cuts, the total of all types of long-range delivery vehicles -- land-based missiles, submarine-based missiles and bombers -- would be limited to 500 to 1,100, down from the 1,600 now allowed. 
 ''For some it is not enough of a cut, for others it is too much, too fast,'' said one senior Defense Department official, who like other officials interviewed spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to describe the internal, classified discussion of the review. 
 Another senior Pentagon official said the calculations not only were about specific numbers but also finding the right balance: ''So long as there are nuclear weapons in the world, how do we sustain a safe, secure and effective nuclear deterrent for us, and that can be extended to our allies? How do you define that?'' 
 As Washington hammers out an arms deal with Moscow, negotiators may also glean insights from the Russians that would help answer these questions, according to another senior State Department official. 
 Senior officials involved in the review point out that the configuration of today's arsenal offers Mr. Obama some flexibility, even in advance of the final negotiations. Several hundred bombers and missile silos have been removed from nuclear use or decommissioned, yet still are counted under current treaty rules. 
 The United States has just under 900 operational nuclear warhead platforms, meaning that Mr. Obama could easily give up significant numbers of missiles or planes in negotiations because they have already been taken out of nuclear service, officials said.
 The review will look closely at the contentious question of whether the arsenal should be used to threaten retaliation in case of catastrophic attack by an adversary using nonnuclear weapons, whether chemical, biological or even overwhelming conventional forces, against the United States or an ally. Reshaping the list of targets for America's nuclear warheads, officials said, also is under discussion.
 ''With the end of the cold war and the development of new conventional technologies, the traditional purposes for U.S. nuclear weapons have become increasingly less relevant,'' said Daryl G. Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, an independent advocacy group.
 ''We can and should limit the role of our nuclear weapons to a core deterrence mission,'' he added, noting that deterring attacks on the United States and its allies ''requires far fewer nuclear warheads and delivery systems.''
 Over the decades, however, the United States consciously maintained ambiguity in public statements about its nuclear policy -- when it would strike, what it would strike and in response to which actions by an adversary.
 ''We don't want to box our leaders in,'' said a senior Pentagon official. ''They like to hedge against uncertainty. They like to have options.''

HEADLINE: After Recess, Health Talk Steps Lively

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The conventional wisdom, here and around the country, is that the centerpiece of President Obama's domestic agenda -- remaking the health care system to cut costs and cover the uninsured -- is on life support and that only a political miracle could revive it.
 Here's why the conventional wisdom might be wrong: 
 While the month of August clearly knocked the White House back on its heels, as Congressional town hall-style meetings exposed Americans' unease with an overhaul, the uproar does not seem to have greatly altered public opinion or substantially weakened Democrats' resolve.
 Critical players in the health care industry remain at the negotiating table, meaning they are not out whipping up public or legislative opposition. 
 Despite tensions between moderate and liberal Democrats, there is broad agreement within the party over most of what a package would look like. Four of the five Congressional committees considering health care legislation have already passed bills. Each would require all Americans to have insurance and provide government subsidies for those who cannot afford it. Each would bar insurance companies from refusing coverage for pre-existing conditions; imposing lifetime caps on coverage; or dropping people when they get sick.
 Getting a bill through the Senate remains a big challenge, but even there, the Obama administration has a reasonable chance of corralling the 60 votes it would need to pass legislation more or less on its terms. One wavering Democratic moderate, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, signaled over the weekend that he might be able to go along with one of the compromise proposals under discussion. Senator Olympia J. Snowe, the Maine Republican whose vote would be vital to Mr. Obama, remains deeply engaged in negotiations, and there are indications that one or two other Republicans, like Senator George V. Voinovich of Ohio, might be in play.
 Politically, there is an imperative for Democrats to act; they remember well the disastrous political fate that befell them in 1994, when they lost control of the House and Senate after failing to pass a health bill under President Bill Clinton. Rahm Emanuel, the bare-knuckled political operative and former Clinton aide who is now the White House chief of staff, has wasted little time in reminding his fellow Democrats that, as he said in an interview Tuesday, ''the inability to act here will have political consequences.''
 None of this is to understate the magnitude of the task facing Mr. Obama as he begins a final drive for the legislation with a nationally televised address to Congress on Wednesday night. The size and complexity of the legislation, the deep partisan divide, the undercurrent of concern among voters about whether government is getting too big and intrusive, opposition from special interests -- all create land mines that could still blow up the effort.
 But even after weeks filled with seemingly ominous portents for Mr. Obama's ambitions, there is evidence that public opinion remains basically supportive of him. Despite intense controversy over the ''public option,'' a government-backed insurance plan that would compete with the private sector, a CBS poll at the end of August found that 60 percent of Americans still support the idea, down from 66 percent in July. And half the respondents to the poll said Mr. Obama had better ideas on health care than Republicans, down from 55 percent.
 Mr. Obama likes to say that in the 100 years since President Theodore Roosevelt began advocating universal health care, ''we've never had such broad agreement on what needs to be done.'' On Capitol Hill, it is possible to see how a compromise could come together; Mr. Nelson indicated over the weekend that he could back a provision known as a ''trigger'' to create a public option if private efforts to cover the uninsured failed. 
 And despite the fracas of August, the major stakeholders in the health care debate -- hospitals, doctors, insurers and the pharmaceutical industry -- have not abandoned the negotiations. Ralph G. Neas, chief executive of the National Coalition on Health Care and a veteran of Washington legislative fights, said this was especially significant.
 ''They're saying to themselves: 'We're going to get 30 to 40 or 50 million new customers. This is in our economic self interest,' '' Mr. Neas said. ''That, as much as anything else, could propel this forward to a law that does provide quality health care for all.''
 Mr. Obama still clearly has not closed the deal, which is a major reason he will be making his case directly to the American people and their elected representatives on Wednesday night. The CBS poll found that 6 in 10 Americans say Mr. Obama has not clearly explained what his plans for health reform would mean.
 That is a problem for the White House, though it also presents the president with an opportunity to reframe the debate on his own terms. In his address on Wednesday, Mr. Obama has promised to outline what he wants to see in a bill; Republican leaders say the message from August is that Democrats and the president need to start over.
 ''At this point, there really should be no doubt where the American people stand: the status quo is not acceptable, but neither are any of the proposals we've seen from the White House or Democrats in Congress,'' Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, said in a statement, adding: ''It should be clear by now that the problem isn't the sales pitch. The problem is what they're selling.''
 Yet Mark McClellan, who ran the Food and Drug Administration and later Medicare under President George W. Bush, said he saw the churning in August as a part of the public's education, a ''necessary step in the process'' and not a fatal blow. 
 Whether or not Mr. Obama gets the kind of comprehensive bill he is hoping for, Dr. McClellan said, Congress is all but certain to take up health legislation by early next year to fix a measure that would impose a draconian 21 percent cut in Medicare reimbursements to doctors. And once it is tinkering with health care, he said, it is not that big a leap to imagine lawmakers using that bill to take smaller steps toward expanding coverage and passing insurance market reforms.
 ''Everybody is talking about how the public is very concerned about some of the specifics that they've heard,'' Dr. McClellan said. ''But the public is also very concerned about some aspects of the health care system, including the cost, including the security of their coverage. So depending on how this plays politically, I think there is the foundation for building support for broader legislation.''

HEADLINE: Blowing the Pixie Dust Off Disney's Archives

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES

DATELINE: GLENDALE, Calif. 

 BODY:
For the last 50 years, inside an unmarked warehouse here, a historic movie prop has rested in a deep, deep sleep. Last month a Walt Disney Company archivist awakened it.
 Wearing white gloves, Becky Cline, manager of the sprawling repository, gently opened a crate containing the giant bejeweled storybook used for the opening scene of ''Sleeping Beauty,'' the animated classic from 1959. ''We have to be really, really careful with this,'' Ms. Cline said, almost in a whisper.
 The prop, along with dozens of other specimens from Disney films that have long been kept under lock and key, will headline an unusual exhibition of memorabilia that opens on Thursday and runs through the weekend at the Anaheim Convention Center in Southern California. Also included: the coonskin cap that Fess Parker wore as Davy Crockett (leading to a national craze), Annette Funicello's Mouseketeer shirt, a costume from the 1950s TV series ''Zorro'' and the four-wheeled star of ''The Love Bug.'' 
 The exhibition, ''Treasures of the Walt Disney Archives,'' will also include modern grails (Miley Cyrus's blond ''Hannah Montana'' wig) and items from Walt Disney's own office (like the rotary-dial telephone, dingy cord and all). ''We would never clean it -- that's Walt's grime,'' Ms. Cline said.
 The exhibition forms the centerpiece of Disney's attempt to stage its own version of Comic-Con International, the giant annual gathering for fans of comics and science-fiction entertainment that has become a major event on Hollywood's calendar. Called D23 Expo, Disney's show will include elaborate pavilions where the company's theme park, movie studio, television and consumer products branches will promote their wares -- both existing and planned. Over 30,000 people are expected to attend.
 It's an overt sales pitch for the Disney brand, already considered one of the strongest in the world. But the company is also keenly aware that the Internet has given consumers added muscle in determining public sentiment -- over 1,000 blogs parse all things Disney -- and is trying to ''superserve'' that constituency.
 D23 is the brainchild of the company's public relations branch. (The 23 is short for 1923, the year Walt Disney opened his California studio.) Disney will auction a handful of items in conjunction with the exhibition, including animation cels from films like ''The Jungle Book,'' a pirate galleon vehicle from the Peter Pan's Flight ride at Disneyland and props from ''High School Musical 3: Senior Year.''
 The event is also emblematic of a philosophical shift at Disney. In previous decades the company's point of view was imperious: we are the great and powerful Disney, and we will tell families how best to spend their leisure time. That approach made some consumers resentful, a sentiment that a new executive team has spent recent years working to soothe. Moreover, Disney now feels competition from Nickelodeon and DreamWorks Animation, among others.
 The archives are a good example of the attitude change. The company has given independent researchers access and has occasionally lent or donated items. The Smithsonian Institution has one of Disneyland's famous teacups, for instance. But most of the trove has been almost entirely hidden from the public. 
 Ms. Cline estimates that 80 percent of the collection, which the company says contains over a million items, has never been exhibited. That mandate partly came from Walt Disney himself, who died in 1966: we do not talk about how we make the magic.
 The holdings were even a bit of a mystery to Robert A. Iger, who became Disney's chief executive four years ago. He toured the archive after taking over and was surprised at what he found. The 92-item exhibition may ultimately be mounted as a traveling show, similar to what Warner Brothers is doing with its successful tour of ''Harry Potter'' props.
 ''It became increasingly apparent that the crown jewels of eight decades of Disney history needed to be shared with the world,'' Mr. Iger said in an e-mail message.
 Ms. Cline and her seven archives colleagues are still trying to catalog everything, while crossing their fingers that some vanished items, like the carpetbag that Julie Andrews carried in ''Mary Poppins,'' will turn up. (''In decades past, studios either threw this stuff away or let it walk off the lot -- it just wasn't deemed important,'' said Tim Luke, a memorabilia dealer in Hobe Sound, Fla., who organized sales that included Disneyana when working at Christie's in the 1990s.) 
 Since Mr. Iger put a renewed focus on the collection, archivists have added about 15,000 items, partly by combing through storerooms. They discovered Walt Disney's travel trunks from the 1930s (he often gave his old personal items to the props department) and a matronly dress Bette Davis wore in the 1978 film ''Return From Witch Mountain.''
 One particularly good find was a costume used to prepare ''Pinocchio'' in 1940. (The studio shot footage of costumed actors pantomiming action in the script so animators could study their movements.) It was rotting off its hanger in the back of a wardrobe building.
 ''Sometimes we have to get really down and dirty,'' Ms. Cline said, recalling the time she and a colleague donned hard hats and dust masks to salvage items at a Walt Disney World ride being refurbished.
 Less arduous was a recent trip to George Lucas's compound in Northern California. Ms. Cline flew there to fetch the white leather uniform Michael Jackson wore in ''Captain EO,'' the film that was a 1980s-era attraction at Disney's parks. Mr. Lucas, who produced and was a co-writer of the mini-movie, agreed to lend the costume for the D23 exhibition after Jackson's death.
 But much of Ms. Cline's attention has been focused on the ''Sleeping Beauty'' storybook. With its hammered brass cover and hand-painted pages, the prop cost about $1,500 to make (or $11,000, when adjusted for inflation). Time has not been kind, however, and some of the colored-glass frills need repair.
 Ms. Cline will hand carry the book to the Anaheim Convention Center. ''It's not just a movie prop -- it's part of our bedrock,'' she said.

Nearly four months before Tavern on the Green, the landmark restaurant in Central Park, is to yield its license to another operator, the landmark restaurant in Central Park has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. 
 In a statement, the current license holder, Jennifer Oz LeRoy, chief executive of Tavern, said that the filing was ''our only alternative given the current situation.'' She said the decision was the result of ''two factors -- the extreme financial distress brought on by the current financial crisis and the City of New York's decision not to renew our license.'' 
 On Aug. 28, the Department of Parks and Recreation announced that the new 20-year license would be taken over by Dean J. Poll, who runs the Central Park Boathouse restaurant. The current license expires on Dec. 31.
 Ms. LeRoy's father, the restaurateur Warner LeRoy, who died in 2001, took over the restaurant in 1976. ''We are proud of the service we have provided to thousands of patrons over the years,'' Ms. LeRoy said. 
 She added, ''We plan to honor all of our obligations to our loyal employees and customers until our lease expires at the end of the year.'' 
 The filing in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York listed 20 creditors. The largest, the New York Hotel Trades Council, was owed $1,778,764. Other creditors included the New York Tent Company, for $104,156; American Express, for $79,096; the parks department, for $76,923; and Gotham Seafood, for $68,197. 
 For years, the restaurant, near West 67th Street, has been one of the highest-grossing independently owned restaurants in the United States.
 In June, Ms. LeRoy started a public relations effort to keep the license, called ''Keep Tavern on the Green,'' and a lobbying effort was aimed at City Hall to influence the choice of the operator. But the parks department chose Mr. Poll.

HEADLINE: Referees And N.B.A. Can't Reach Agreement

BYLINE: By HOWARD BECK

 BODY:
Contract talks between the N.B.A. and its referees have collapsed amid acrimony and accusations of bad faith, increasing the odds that the league will hire replacement referees to start the preseason.
 Negotiators, including Commissioner David Stern, met Tuesday afternoon at the league's Midtown Manhattan offices but left without a deal, and with bad feelings all around. Stern charged the referees union with reneging on key points. The union's lead negotiator, Lamell McMorris, accused Stern of acting unprofessionally and disrespectfully.
 Both men projected frustration in separate phone interviews Wednesday. 
 ''Right now, I'm not optimistic,'' Stern said, although he stopped short of predicting a lockout.
 McMorris sounded almost resigned to that outcome when asked what he was telling his members. ''The message,'' he said, ''is that they should prepare to be locked out, and that we've done our part.''
 No additional talks are scheduled, and time is running out. The first preseason game is scheduled for Oct. 1, between Denver and Utah. Ideally, the parties would reach agreement by Sept. 20, when the league's 57 referees are due to arrive in New Jersey for their annual training camp.
 The N.B.A. has not used replacement referees since 1995, when a labor dispute dragged into early December. The consensus of fans and players then was that the substitutes were overmatched.
 Stern did not deny reports that the league has begun recruiting replacements, which would almost certainly include referees from the NBA Development League. ''I can confirm that we have referees who have to start training relatively soon, and we're planning to start the season with an officiating staff,'' he said, adding later, ''It's very sad to have to move to that, but obviously our obligation is to the game.''
 The previous five-year deal between the N.B.A. and the referees expired after last season. The breakdown in contract talks was first reported by ESPN.com.
 League officials, responding to the global recession, want to reduce the referee budget by 10 percent, or $3.2 million, according to the ESPN report. The union has offered to accept a reduction of $2.5 million, leaving a gap of $700,000. A person involved in the talks also cited those figures, although league officials called them inaccurate.
 Stern confirmed that the N.B.A. wants to reduce the referee budget but said he was not asking the referees to take any reduction in salary. He declined to get into specific provisions, or address the figures that have been reported. 
 ''I think it is fair to say they have moved off their request for a 12 percent increase,'' Stern said, with a hint of sarcasm. ''They've moved off of that and we thought they were making progress.''
 The parties have apparently agreed on the length of a new deal. At the union's request, it will span two years, in the hope that the economy rebounds by 2011.
 McMorris said the gap between the union's proposal and the N.B.A.'s ''is not big enough, in terms of how far we are apart, to justify a lockout.'' But the tenor of his remarks, and Stern's, suggest that it might be difficult to find common ground.
 McMorris said he was ''frustrated and disappointed at the unprofessional and disrespectful manner in which Mr. Stern ended what was a productive negotiating session'' on Tuesday. He theorized that Stern was taking a hard line with the referees ''to send a message to the players,'' whose labor deal expires in 2011.
 Stern pointedly rebutted the suggestion, saying, ''This has nothing to do with the player negotiations.'' 
 He said Tuesday's session deteriorated when the union reneged on previously agreed-upon points. He did not elaborate.
 The labor dispute comes at an inopportune time. Two years ago, the N.B.A. was rocked by the revelation that a veteran referee, Tim Donaghy, had conspired with professional gamblers. No other referees were implicated by the government, although Donaghy has repeatedly suggested that the league has deeper problems.

HEADLINE: Looking for a (Long) Leg Up

BYLINE: By ERIC WILSON

 BODY:
TEN years ago, when Amy Astley, then the beauty director of Vogue, began working on a prototype of a spinoff magazine for teenagers, the question she was most commonly asked by potential readers was this: ''How can I become a fashion model?''
 ''It was really depressing,'' said Ms. Astley, now the editor of Teen Vogue.
 They all wanted to be models, and of course they couldn't, so Ms. Astley found herself offering teenagers a harsh dose of reality, rather than something positive or inspiring.
 ''That was the most visible career in fashion at the time,'' she said. ''But I've seen a really profound change. They don't ask me anymore how to become a model, or if I've met Britney or Justin Timberlake.'' 
 Now they ask how they can get her job. 
 What changed, Ms. Astley said, is that teenagers around the world have become interested in all sorts of careers in fashion as a result of the industry's increasingly outsize place in popular culture. ''Project Runway,'' the designer competition originally set at Parsons the New School for Design, has alone been credited with causing a spike in applications to fashion schools. At Parsons, applications have gone up 41 percent over the last five years. At Pratt Institute, they have gone up 20 percent. 
 ''We have tour buses stopping outside so tourists can take pictures of us,'' said Simon Collins, the dean of fashion at Parsons. ''They're looking for Tim Gunn or Heidi Klum or something.'' 
 And given the intense scrutiny directed at ''The September Issue,'' the behind-the-scenes documentary of a single issue of Vogue, and the ever-escalating coverage of Fashion Week, which begins Thursday in Bryant Park, it stands to reason that there will be even more interest to come. Feeding on the demand, Teen Vogue has its own book coming out next month called ''The Teen Vogue Handbook,'' a how-to guide for students dreaming of jobs as a designer, stylist, photographer or editor.
 For much of America's youth, fashion is where it's at. But this wave of Anna Wintours and Michael Korses in training is coming at a moment when the industry is shrinking; retailers are collapsing; several magazines within Teen Vogue's parent company, Conde Nast, have closed; and jobs, of any sort, are scarce. A report last month from the NPD Group estimated that 12 percent of fashion companies will not survive the recession.
 The situation is not entirely grim for new fashion graduates, even though the National Association of Colleges and Employers said in March that employers expected to hire 22 percent fewer seniors graduating in 2009 for entry level positions. Normally about 90 percent of Parsons seniors find jobs, but that figure dipped by only 10 percent. At Pratt and at the Fashion Institute of Technology, they have remained about the same.
 ''But we are seeing a trend toward some jobs disappearing into unpaid internships, which is a little troubling,'' said Judy Nylen, the director of career services at Pratt.
 So what is a young person trying to break into fashion supposed to do?
 DON'T EXPECT TO START AT THE TOP
 Let us take the example of Sang A Im-Propp, who was a pop star in Korea before she decided, while on a business trip to New York, that she wanted to be in fashion. This was nearly a decade ago, and Ms. Im-Propp's command of English was tenuous, but she enrolled at Parsons and in short order found herself an internship with Victoria Bartlett, a noted stylist and designer whom she admired and hoped would introduce her to the glamorous world of design. Instead, Ms. Im-Propp found it difficult to understand Ms. Bartlett's heavy British accent, and at first she thought she had misunderstood just what Ms. Bartlett was asking her to do. Get cupcakes?
 Not just any cupcakes, but the glossy butter-cream confections from the Cupcake Cafe, which is a four-block crosstown walk from Ms. Bartlett's studio through the dodgy garment district, and it was freezing outside.
 ''It made me cry a lot,'' Ms. Im-Propp said. ''Vicky is an amazing artist, but she can be difficult.''
 But Ms. Im-Propp persisted, and after many cupcake runs, was entrusted with the research projects, location scouting and shopping collections Ms. Bartlett did not have time to see. When she decided in 2006 to start her own collection of handbags, under the label Sang A, Ms. Bartlett personally recommended her to a showroom. 
 Ms. Bartlett, reminded of the cupcake episodes, said she had been a deliberate taskmaster with interns, having encountered a few who did not live up to expectations. There was one who, without asking, borrowed her car on several occasions, and another who ran off to Los Angeles with the company computer.
 ''You can't be a princess in this business,'' she said. ''People see fashion from the end result, which is kind of a false facade. They only see this beautiful, glamorous world, but I don't think they realize it is one of the hardest careers out there.''
 BE PREPARED TO SUFFER
 This is a point that is made repeatedly in ''The Teen Vogue Handbook,'' which compiles stories of how many now-famous designers and editors got their starts. The common themes in the histories of Marc Jacobs, Ms. Wintour, Gucci Westman and Mario Testino are that hard work and persistence lead to opportunities to be seized -- with a caveat, of course, that it'll be a lot harder than that for anyone else. Karl Lagerfeld says that rather archly: ''Are you ready to accept injustice? The idea of the fashion industry may look better from the outside. It can look like the world of dream jobs -- for a very happy few.''
 Still interested?
 It's a wonder, given the portrayal of fashion in ''The Devil Wears Prada'' and the counterpoint of ''The September Issue,'' that anyone would think this is a glamorous business. (There is the specter of Grace Coddington in the new film directing a colleague, ''Don't be too nice, not even to me, because you'll lose.'') 
 In the real world, it's just as tough. Prabal Gurung, the hot newcomer, said that his first job was working for a cuckoo designer in India who staged a fashion show with models eating chicken wings. Kelly Cutrone, the salty publicist and reality-show fixture, often starts a job interview by telling the applicant, ''You'll be very lucky if you start and end your career liking clothes.''
 ''The truth is,'' said the designer Phillip Lim, ''a lot of doors are shut right now, and no one is going to open them.'' But Mr. Lim cited his own start as a reason not to give up hope. As a young salesman at Barneys in Los Angeles, he was so naive that he simply picked up the phone and called the office of Katayone Adeli and asked for a job, which brings us to our next point.
 NAIVITE IS BLISS
 ''Don't listen to other people,'' Ms. Astley said. ''If you want to work in fashion, you should do it. You should move to New York.''
 Among the current crop of interns at Teen Vogue, there is little fear that the future of fashion will happen without their participation. They tell stories about 12-hour days of sorting through piles of shopping bags looking for a single skirt; or blisters from running garment bags around the city; or the bummer of being sent to a famous designer's showroom and glimpsing only the messenger center. Or the thrill, in the case of Media Brecher, who is 20 and a student at Barnard College, of seeing a headline she suggested for a denim story, ''Bleach Streak,'' appear in the August issue. 
 (It does help to have connections, as Ms. Brecher is the daughter of The Wall Street Journal wine columnists Dorothy J. Gaiter and John Brecher; and Hope Brimelow, another intern, met Teen Vogue editors in Paris while her mother, a producer on ''60 Minutes,'' was filming a profile of Anna Wintour. But Ms. Astley said that connections are not required at a publication that employs as many as 40 interns at a time.)
 ''Anyone can contribute to fashion now because of how accessible it has become,'' said Vanessa Stylianos, 20, a New York University communications major who started working in the fashion closet last month.
 ON THE OTHER HAND ...
 Ms. Astley recalled a recent job applicant who was clearly unqualified to work at her magazine.
 ''I interviewed someone who hadn't seen 'Twilight,' '' she said. ''You can't work at Teen Vogue if you haven't seen 'Twilight.' ''
 With designers, too, it helps to be aware of their work, even wearing an item of their clothing to a job interview, but goodness, not head to toe. This is a blunder seen by Karen Harvey, a fashion headhunter, who said that it looks as if you are trying too hard.
 ''You want to demonstrate your personal style and then integrate something of theirs,'' she said. ''They want to see how your styles will connect.''
 ASK LOTS OF QUESTIONS
 This can be tricky. Most employers value a go-getter who doesn't need to be told what to do, but they also appreciate a display of interest. A suggestion from Kenneth Wyse, the president of licensing at Phillips-Van Heusen, who also is president of the Fashion Scholarship Fund, an industry group that helps mentor young people with internships: Submit a list of questions once a week.
 ''One of my favorite stories was that after working here for a summer, a young lady said to me, 'Gee, I had no idea that a collection business could lose money,' '' Mr. Wyse recalled.
 BE PERSISTENT, AND IT HELPS TO BE CHARMING
 It was March 1996 in the suburbs of Detroit, where Jamie Rubin, age 10, was doing her homework, writing a speech about what she wanted to be when she grew up. Ms. Rubin had no idea, but her favorite dress was a really simple gray jumper by Nicole Miller, and so, she said, ''I just decided that's what I wanted to do, to give little girls their favorite dress.'' 
 As part of the assignment, Ms. Rubin filmed a video in which she charmingly announced, ''When I grow up, I'm going to be the next Nicole Miller!'' She was so convincing that her parents sent the video to the designer's showroom in New York, where it became an office favorite. Ms. Miller was so taken by Ms. Rubin that she invited her for a tour of her showroom and, eight years later, when Ms. Rubin enrolled at Parsons, offered her an internship for a summer, working right by her side. 
 ''I felt like I was meeting Oz,'' Ms. Rubin said. ''I couldn't even speak when I first met her.''
 If her story sounds too easy, Ms. Rubin, now 23, will point out that things were not so simple once she graduated. Even though she had also interned for Women's Wear Daily and for Proenza Schouler, she had little response from the hundreds of resumes she sent out, except for one she sent to a showroom where she was dying to work, as she noted in a cover letter that she accidentally addressed to one of its competitors. ''I got an e-mail back saying, 'That's nice, if you want to a job there, you should send them an application,' '' Ms. Rubin said. 
 She did land an interview at Dolce & Gabbana and bought a blouse for the occasion, but it was loose-fitting and the reason Ms. Rubin suspects she never got a call back. After much persistence, she was offered a job at a creative agency that represents Tod's, Hogan and other luxury brands. 
 ''The door will close on you 900 times,'' she said. ''So you've got to keep your skin tough and your goals very focused. I walk into work every day and know I'm going to be challenged and inspired, and that's the recipe for happiness in any job.''

HEADLINE: For the Few, Their Own Private Dressing Room

BYLINE: By ALAN FEUER

DATELINE: Beyond those elusive green shoots 

 BODY:
3 percent potential growth next year, a gradually rising Dow -- one of the things you hear a lot about these days, economy-wise, is ''the stratified American consumer'': that poor financial schizophrenic caught between the well-off (and apparently still-spending) Dr. Jekyll and the cash-strapped (and mostly middle-class) Mr. Hyde. 
 According to a report released last month by Merrill Lynch and Bank of America, the top 10 percent of income earners in the country escaped the current crisis more or less unburdened; but those in the middle are unsurprisingly going under with a debt-to-income ratio of more than two to one. 
 While this hardly serves as news in New York City -- where a single digit added to your Park Avenue address (say, 1565 instead of 565) can often mean the difference between a public housing project and a classic East Side co-op -- Manhattan does provide a good petri dish for studying the resilient bacterium of wealth. 
 Take Room 4, for instance, a peach-walled dressing room in the personal shopping department at Bergdorf Goodman, at Fifth Avenue and 58th Street. The other day, despite the gloom and doom about another wretched retail season in the offing, the room had just been used by a local woman of means whose castaways -- a multithousand-dollar black sequined ball gown among them -- were still there hanging on the racks. 
 ''Everything is possible here,'' said Todd Okerstrom, Bergdorf's immaculately clad director of personal shopping. The room has room service -- a Gotham salad, maybe, brought down fresh from the BG Restaurant on the seventh floor? -- and free advisers to help you make your purchases or pack for your safari. If it's Champagne you want, to lubricate your afternoon of shopping, well, it's certainly not a problem. A member of the staff needs only pick up a black phone hanging on the wall to secure a glass.
 Much to his credit, Mr. Okerstrom points out that the clients who use Room 4 are not just ''royalty or visiting heads of state'' but also ordinary people, who use it as a tool for doing business. Indeed, he said, the main draw is not luxury but convenience. ''The time factor is enormously important,'' he explained. ''People walk into this room with an array of merchandise already spread out for them and simply make their choices -- bing, bing, bing.'' 
 Then again, as everybody knows, time is also money, and even the most ''ordinary'' personal-shopping clients are likely to be standing on the happy side of the national stratification. It is a blind spot of the boutique trade to create false divisions among the comfortable, the rich and the extremely rich. The WiFi service, the lighted three-way mirrors, the zebra-patterned ottomans are elegant and value-adding appointments, but they were clearly not put there with a Brooklyn steamfitter or a factory hand from Michigan in mind.
 The question is: So what? Investment dressing, as those in the industry are often wont to call it, is surely not for everyone, but that is less a moral judgment than a simple fact of life. Consumers, unlike citizens, are not created equal (and, barring revolution, probably never will be). 
 In Room 4, everything is possible -- for some, and at a price. There are fruit plates, steaming pots of tea and doting attendants to help you order tuna rolls from Nobu 57. But there is still no such thing as a free lunch.

HEADLINE: From Deep Pacific, Ugly and Tasty, With a Catch

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD

 BODY:
The answer to the eternal mystery of what makes up a Filet-O-Fish sandwich turns out to involve an ugly creature from the sunless depths of the Pacific, whose bounty, it seems, is not limitless. 
 The world's insatiable appetite for fish, with its disastrous effects on populations of favorites like red snapper, monkfish and tuna, has driven commercial fleets to deeper waters in search of creatures unlikely to star on the Food Network.
 One of the most popular is the hoki, or whiptail, a bug-eyed specimen found far down in the waters around New Zealand and transformed into a major export. McDonald's alone at one time used roughly 15 million pounds of it each year.
 The hoki may be exceedingly unattractive, but when its flesh reaches the consumer it's just fish -- cut into filets and sticks or rolled into sushi -- moist, slightly sweet and very tasty. Better yet, the hoki fishery was thought to be sustainable, providing New Zealand with a reliable major export for years to come. 
 But arguments over managing this resource are flaring not only between commercial interests and conservationists, but also among the environmental agencies most directly involved in monitoring and regulating the catch. 
 A lot of money is at stake, as well as questions about the effectiveness of global guidelines meant to limit the effects of industrial fishing. 
 Without formally acknowledging that hoki are being overfished, New Zealand has slashed the allowable catch in steps, from about 275,000 tons in 2000 and 2001 to about 100,000 tons in 2007 and 2008 -- a decline of nearly two-thirds.
 The scientific jury is still out, but critics warn that the hoki fishery is losing its image as a showpiece of oceanic sustainability. 
 ''We have major concerns,'' said Peter Trott, the fisheries program manager in Australia for the World Wildlife Fund, which closely monitors the New Zealand fishery.
 The problems, he said, include population declines, ecosystem damage and the accidental killing of skates and sharks. He added that New Zealand hoki managers let industry ''get as much as it can from the resource without alarm bells ringing.''
 The hoki lives in inky darkness about a half-mile down and grows to more than four feet long, its body ending in a sinuous tail of great length. Large eyes give the fish a startled look.
 Scientists say its fate represents a cautionary tale much like that of its heavily harvested forerunner, orange roughy. That deepwater fish reproduces slowly and lives more than 100 years. Around New Zealand, catches fell steeply in the early 1990s under the pressures of industrial fishing, in which factory trawlers work around the clock hauling in huge nets with big winches.
 Hoki rose commercially as orange roughy fell. Its shorter life span (up to 25 years) and quicker pace of reproduction seemed to promise sustainable harvests. And its dense spawning aggregations, from June to September, made colossal hauls relatively easy.
 As a result, the New Zealand Ministry of Fisheries set very high quotas -- roughly 275,000 tons a year from 1996 to 2001. Dozens of factory trawlers plied the deep waters, and dealers shipped frozen blocks and fillets of the fish around the globe.
 Moreover, the fishery won certification in March 2001 from the Marine Stewardship Council, a private fisheries assessment group in London, which called it sustainable and well managed. The group's blue label became a draw for restaurant fish buyers. 
 ''Most Americans have no clue that hoki is often what they're eating in fried-fish sandwiches,'' SeaFood Business, an industry magazine, reported in April 2001. It said chain restaurants using hoki included McDonald's, Denny's and Long John Silver's.
 Ominous signs of overfishing -- mainly drops in hoki spawns -- came soon thereafter. Criticism from ecological groups soared. The stewardship council promotes hoki as sustainable ''in spite of falling fish stocks and the annual killing of hundreds of protected seals, albatross and petrels,'' the Royal Forest and Bird Protection Society of New Zealand said in May 2004.
 When the stewardship council had to decide whether to recertify the hoki fishery as sustainable and well managed, the World Wildlife Fund, a Washington-based group that helped found the council, was strongly opposed. ''The impacts of bottom trawling by the hoki fishery must be reduced,'' the fund said. 
 The wildlife fund was overruled, and the council recertified the fishery in October 2007. At the same time, the New Zealand ministry cut the quota still further, reducing the allowable commercial catch from roughly 110,000 tons to about 100,000 tons.
 Some restaurants cut back on hoki amid the declines and the controversy.
 Last year, Yum Brands, which owns Long John Silver's, issued a corporate responsibility report that cited its purchases of New Zealand hoki as praiseworthy because the fishery was ''certified as sustainable.''
 Now, Ben Golden, a Yum Brands spokesman, said hoki was ''not on the menu.''
 Denny's said it served hoki only in its New Zealand restaurants.
 Gary Johnson, McDonald's senior director of global purchasing, said hoki use was down recently to about 11 million pounds annually from roughly 15 million pounds -- a drop of about 25 percent. ''It could go up if the quota goes up,'' he said in an interview. He noted that McDonald's also used other whitefish for its Filet-O-Fish sandwiches.
 Mr. Johnson called the diminishing quotas a sign not of strain on fish stocks but of good management. ''Everything we've seen and heard,'' he said, ''suggests the fishery is starting to come back.''
 The Ministry of Fisheries agreed. ''If you look at the current state of the fishery, it's apparent that the string of management actions that we've taken, which came at severe economic impact, have been effective,'' said Aoife Martin, manager of deepwater fisheries. 
 But the Blue Ocean Institute, a conservation group in East Norwich, N.Y., that scores seafood for ecological impact on a scale from green to red, still gives New Zealand hoki an unfavorable orange rating. The fish is less abundant over all, the group says, and the fishery ''takes significant quantities of seabirds and fur seals.'' 
 Mr. Trott of the wildlife fund was more pointed. He called the fishery's management ''driven by short-term gains at the expense of long-term rewards'' -- a characterization the ministry strongly rejects.
 But he, too, held out the prospect of a turnaround that would raise the hoki's abundance off New Zealand and significantly reduce levels of ecological damage and accidental killing. 
 ''We are currently working with both industry and government to rectify all these issues,'' he said. ''Our hope is that we will see great change and willingness by industry and, importantly, government to improve the situation dramatically.''

HEADLINE: Recession Cuts Into States' Gambling Revenues

BYLINE: By IAN URBINA

DATELINE: CINCINNATI 

 BODY:
Casinos and lotteries in most states are reporting a downturn in revenue for the first time, resulting in a drop in the money collected by state and local governments, according to new state data.
 The decline comes as states are rapidly expanding gambling in hopes of stemming severe budget shortfalls, and it indicates that gambling is not insulated from broader economic forces like recessions, as has been argued in the past.
 The drop has led some gambling experts to wonder whether the industry is reaching market saturation, whereby a limited number of gamblers with a fixed amount of money to bet is being split across a growing number of gambling options. 
 States that have been invested in gambling the longest have been hit hardest. Illinois reported a $166 million drop in tax revenue in fiscal year 2009, from 2008; Nevada had a $122 million drop, and New Jersey $62 million. 
 In hopes of enticing more gamblers, New Jersey lawmakers have repealed a smoking ban, and in Illinois they are considering allowing free drinks on riverboat casinos.
 ''The data shows that states take a real chance in depending on gambling because this revenue is not likely to keep pace with growing budgetary needs,'' said Lucy Dadayan, a senior analyst at the Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of Government at the State University at Albany, which will release a report on the subject next week.
 ''In the absence of new types of gambling, it can become a zero-sum game as states compete for the same pot.''
 Others, however, argue that the current decline is temporary, and that the industry has plenty of room to expand. Some experts expect revenues to bounce back, but doubt they will be as robust as they were before the recession.
 The 12 states that have casinos made $4.5 billion in fiscal year 2009, which ended June 30, a 7.4 percent drop from last year, according to the state data. Among the 42 states with lotteries, 38 reported data indicating that they made $14.5 billion this year, a 2.6 percent drop compared with the earnings from the same states last year.
 Gambling critics have long maintained that it provides short-term revenue at the expense of long-term social costs, like increased crime and addiction. But the new data also shows that the revenue collected by states and local governments is decreasing while competition for it is on the rise. Still, state leaders are looking for ways to get a piece of the earnings. 
 Here in Ohio, Gov. Ted Strickland, a Democrat and former Methodist minister, reversed his opposition to gambling and, in conjunction with the legislature, issued a directive allowing video slots at the state's seven racetracks. 
 In Colorado, voters last year backed an increase in betting limits at casinos, and Missouri voters approved the end of limits on how much a gambler can lose. ''We need those slots like nobody's business,'' said Mildred Cox, 77, who for 28 years has run the concession stand at River Downs here, one of the seven horse racing tracks slated to receive some of the state's 17,500 proposed new slot machines. ''Look at this place, it's desolate.''
 Across from her, a crowd of older men, betting tickets in hand, stood staring at several televisions mounted on the wall showing races in other states and Canada. 
 As a bell rang, the horses sprinted by, competing for a winning prize of $4,600. But the men barely broke their concentration from the televisions. 
 ''You can't attract the best horses and the biggest bettors with purses like that,'' said Ms. Cox, pointing outside at a largely empty grandstand.
 Thirty years ago, gamblers had to go to Las Vegas or Atlantic City to bet legally. Now, a dozen states have commercial casinos, 12 have ''racinos,'' or slot machines and other games that are installed at racetracks, 29 states have Indian casinos, and 42 states and the District of Columbia, have lotteries. 
 ''When budgets get tight, expanding gambling always looks to lawmakers like the perfect quick-fix solution,'' said John Kindt, a professor of business and legal policy at the University of Illinois who studies the impact of state-sponsored gambling. ''But in the end, it so often proves to be neither quick nor a fix.''
 Crime jumps 10 percent in areas with casinos, personal bankruptcies soar 18 percent to 42 percent and the number of new gambling addicts doubles, Mr. Kindt said. Predicted state revenue often falls short and plans frequently get tripped up by legal fights or popular opposition, he said.
 In Delaware, for example, Gov. Jack Markell said in March that he wanted to legalize sports betting in casinos, which he said would bring in $53 million in the first year to help plug an $800 million budget shortfall. But the plan was blocked by a federal court in Philadelphia on Aug. 24 on the grounds that it would undermine confidence in professional sports.
 In Ohio, Governor Strickland reversed his stance on video slots at racetracks based on a ''conservative'' estimate that the new machines would net more than $760 million to the state.
 But the slots are not likely to arrive here any time soon because a lawsuit is pending before the Ohio Supreme Court that argues that the plan should be placed before the voters. The slots may also get overtaken by a proposed constitutional amendment that will be on the November ballot and would allow four full-fledged casinos, one each in Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus and Toledo. 
 Still, Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr., president of the American Gaming Association, said states had plenty of reasons to want to expand gambling.
 ''Even though our revenues are down during the recession, bringing a casino into a community will still provide new jobs, new tax revenues, new opportunities for local vendors and other benefits that didn't exist before,'' Mr. Fahrenkopf said. ''It isn't surprising that as consumers are tightening their wallets, and with less discretionary spending for entertainment, they are spending less when they visit casinos, too.''
 About 60 percent of people who participate in casino gambling have cut back on spending on the activity, according to a 2008 national survey conducted by the association.
 Despite the downturn, revenue from racinos grew this fiscal year, producing $2.9 billion in taxes and fees in 12 states compared with $2.7 billion the year before, a 6.7 percent increase. 
 But Ms. Dadayan of the Rockefeller Institute said the racino windfalls might be short-lived because slot profits usually soften with time as their novelty wears off and more states add machines. 
 If Pennsylvania and Indiana, where slots are new, are excluded, the total slot revenue from the other 10 states with racinos actually fell by $76 million in fiscal year 2009, a 4 percent decline.

HEADLINE: Russian Schools to Teach 'The Gulag Archipelago'

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: MOSCOW 

 BODY:
The book that made the word gulag a synonym for the horrors of Soviet oppression will be taught in Russian high schools, education officials said Wednesday, a generation after the Soviet Union banned it as destructive to the Communist cause and exiled its author.
 Excerpts from the book, Aleksandr I. Solzhenitsyn's ''The Gulag Archipelago,'' which was published in 1973, will now be required reading for students, the Russian Education Ministry said. 
 Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin is pushing to restore pride in the Soviet past, so the decision could be a reflection of the Russian establishment's struggle to reconcile that pride with the freedoms that Russians now take for granted, nearly 20 years after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the transition to democracy and the free market.
 The government has tried in recent years to control how history is taught, removing textbooks that deviate from the changing official view. In 2003, the authorities banned a history text that was critical of Stalin, the dictator most readily identified with the horrors of the Soviet gulag.
 ''The Gulag Archipelago'' initially circulated underground and soon reached the West in translation. The three-volume book gave the outside world a detailed account of the systematic imprisonment and murder of hundreds of thousands of Russians in the nationwide ''archipelago'' of prisons and labor camps devised by Lenin and expanded by Stalin.
 Soviet officials expelled Mr. Solzhenitsyn in 1974, and he spent the next 20 years in the United States.
 Mr. Solzhenitsyn, who had won the 1970 Nobel Prize for Literature, drew on his own experiences in various labor camps in the 1940s and on the testimony of hundreds of other prisoners who survived the Main Department of Corrective Labor Camps and Colonies, the name of the system of camps which in Russian formed the acronym Gulag.
 Stalin, who died in office in 1953, was recently voted by Russians as their third greatest historical figure, and lyrics praising him have been inscribed in the vestibule of a prominent Moscow subway station.
 Other books by Solzhenitsyn are taught in Russian schools, but choosing ''The Gulag Archipelago'' seemed to go against the Kremlin tendency toward treating Stalin's 24-year rule with nostalgia.
 Human rights activists, however, were hesitant to call it a turnaround.
 Lev Ponomaryov, who campaigns for Russia to repudiate Stalinism, said the Kremlin was worried that the popularity of the Communist Party was increasing at a time of economic crisis. ''The introduction of the books is a rather good way to decrease the popularity of the Communists among the young people,'' he said.
 The Education Ministry said only that the decision involved ''the vital historical and cultural heritage'' contained in Solzhenitsyn's book.
 It was not immediately clear whether the book would be taught in the current school year, which began Sept. 1.
 But whatever the government's motives, Mr. Ponomaryov said he welcomed fact-based education about the gulag, because ''the younger generation should know about the crimes of Bolshevism and Stalinism in Russia.''
 After his expulsion, Solzhenitsyn and his wife led a secluded life in Vermont and he surprised many people by revealing himself as an arch-conservative, who was almost as harshly critical of the West's permissive ways as he was of the Soviet system.
 After a triumphant return from exile in 1994 that included a 56-day train trip across Russia, Solzhenitsyn later expressed disappointment that most Russians had not read his books.
 He died at the age of 89 in August 2008 of a chronic heart condition, mourned in the West as a cold war hero, but never revered at home.

HEADLINE: Fed Survey Finds Signs of a Slow, Fragile Recovery

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
A slow and still-fragile recovery is taking hold across the country, as residential real estate improves, manufacturing orders pick up, consumer prices become firm and businesses express wary optimism about sales. 
 That was the Federal Reserve's assessment on Wednesday in its beige book, a regular snapshot of economic conditions in 12 Fed districts nationwide. 
 While many parts of the economy, like retail sales and commercial real estate, remain frail, others are stabilizing or showing signs of improvement. Since the start of the year, the economic reports in the beige book have steadily brightened, from dismal to less bad to tepid, as the stock markets rebounded and the recession began to loosen its grip. 
 ''The economy is making the transition from recession to recovery,'' said Alan D. Levenson, chief economist at T. Rowe Price, who said he expected the economy to grow at a rate of about 3 percent in the summer, then more modestly in the last months of the year.
 Pockets of weakness still abound throughout the economy. Credit conditions remained tight through August, nonresidential construction continued to slump and demand for loans remained poor. Consumer spending, which makes up the bulk of the nation's economy, was soft in most regions, with retail sales flat.
 And the labor market was described as weak in all regions, reflecting the toll job losses have taken as unemployment hit 9.7 percent, the report said. 
 Manufacturers in New York and the northern plains continued to cut jobs, and the St. Louis Fed said that automakers were expected to cut more positions, despite an infusion of money from the government's recent cash-for-clunkers program. And employees continued to face wage freezes and pay cuts.
 Still, the bright spots among the patchwork of regional economies were multiplying.
 The Dallas Fed district said its economy had firmed up since the last report, in late July, as home sales improved and staffing companies began to hire more temporary workers, an early sign of a possible turnaround in the labor market. Five other districts noted ''signs of improvement,'' the Fed said.
 In New York, the legal and financial industries, devastated by Wall Street's troubles, began to hire more temporary workers. The Chicago Fed district noted higher demand for health care and information technology workers, and districts in the Midwest reported that the government's stimulus measures had a ''positive impact'' on jobs in construction and local government.

HEADLINE: Ruling Could Force the N.H.L. to Live With an Owner It Has Opposed

BYLINE: By JEFF Z. KLEIN

 BODY:
The N.H.L.'s worst fears loom on Thursday as the Phoenix Coyotes go up for auction in United States Bankruptcy Court with only two bidders participating: the N.H.L. and the man whom league owners voted unanimously to exclude from their ranks, the Canadian billionaire James L. Balsillie.
 A defeat in the case would be the latest in a string of embarrassments for the league related to the Coyotes' bankruptcy. 
 Despite the N.H.L.'s claims this summer that several potential buyers beyond Balsillie were interested in the Coyotes, only two stepped forward. But one dropped out in August, prompting the league to enter its own bid, and the other dropped out this week. 
 Now the N.H.L. faces the possibility of Judge Redfield T. Baum's ruling in favor of Balsillie's $242.5 million offer, which would move the Coyotes to Hamilton, Ontario, over the league's $140 million bid, which would keep the team in Arizona pending a projected future sale to another party. 
 Spokesmen for the N.H.L. and for Balsillie's group, PSE Sports and Entertainment, said Wednesday that officials had no comment. 
 Baum said in court last week that he might not make a final ruling on Thursday, adding that there would be one ''certainly before the start of the season'' on Oct. 1.
 The N.H.L. has fought hard against Balsillie's purchase of the club, citing his attempts to buy the Pittsburgh Penguins and the Nashville Predators in recent years. The Penguins' deal fell apart when he would not promise to keep the team in Pittsburgh, and the Predators' deal crashed when he started a season-ticket drive in Hamilton without informing the league.
 In July, the owners voted by 26 to 0 to exclude Balsillie from their ranks because he ''lacked the good character and integrity'' to join them, as Jeremy Jacobs, the Bruins' owner and chairman of the Board of Governors, put it. 
 On Tuesday, however, a part-owner of the Predators, William Del Biaggio III, was sentenced to more than eight years in federal prison after he pleaded guilty to fraud in connection with his purchase of a 24 percent stake in the team. At least two other N.H.L. owners have pleaded guilty to or paid fines for securities violations in the last year and a half.
 Compounding the league's embarrassment, news of the withdrawal of the third bidder for the Coyotes, Ice Edge Holdings, became public in a statement from N.H.L. Commissioner Gary Bettman that was buried in a footnote in court papers filed on Tuesday. 
 ''I was advised today that the Ice Edge Group does not intend to participate in the auction,'' Bettman said in the footnote. 
 Despite the disparity between the two remaining bids, a complicating factor is the position taken by the city of Glendale, Ariz., which says that its 26-year lease with the Coyotes at Jobing.com Arena cannot be broken unless the team pays in the neighborhood of $500 million in damages to compensate for economic losses. 
 Over the Labor Day weekend, Balsillie offered to pay the city $50 million to get out of the lease. But on Wednesday Glendale officials discounted that offer as being worth considerably less because of what City Attorney Craig Tindall called ''multiple contingencies'' attached to the amount. City officials said they remained firmly opposed to Balsillie's bid.
 Peter S. Kaufman, president of the Gordian Group, a New York investment bank and a bankruptcy and restructuring expert, said that in a bankruptcy sale, ''all things being equal, a judge is not going to be terribly excited about taking less for the creditors,'' which seemed to give the advantage to Balsillie.
 Kaufman also said that the N.H.L. ''is likely wearing too many hats'' in bidding for the Coyotes while at the same time deciding whether Balsillie, an opposing bidder, can join the league. That left it open to charges of conflict of interest, which Balsillie's lawyers made in court last week.
 Baum will also have to rule on how much the Coyotes will pay in relocation fees if they move to Hamilton, a figure Balsillie puts at about $12 million and the N.H.L. puts at $101 million to $195 million. 
 ''The notion that a team in Hamilton would be worth only $11.2 million to $12.9 million more than a team in Phoenix is patently absurd,'' the N.H.L. said in a court filing.

HEADLINE: New Yards Design Draws From the Old

BYLINE: By NICOLAI OUROUSSOFF

 BODY:
To say that the 22-acre Atlantic Yards development project in Brooklyn is in disarray is not a major revelation. That it may still be possible to save -- and may even be worth saving -- comes as news.
 When Bruce Ratner, the project's developer, fired Frank Gehry last year -- after getting city approval on the basis of Mr. Gehry's design -- and replaced him with Ellerbe Becket, a firm known for churning out generic stadiums, it seemed like a cynical double cross. Ellerbe Becket's bland proposal for a basketball arena replaced a much more ambitious scheme from Mr. Gehry, which cleverly integrated the arena into a surrounding group of residential and commercial towers. That design seemed destined to create a black hole at one of Brooklyn's most lively intersections. Many were appalled. 
 Chastened, Mr. Ratner quickly hired Shop Architects, a young New York firm, to spiff up the arena, and the results, unveiled on Wednesday, are somewhat more promising. Some of Mr. Gehry's original ideas, like opening views from the sidewalk into the arena, have been restored. Mr. Ratner has reduced the size of the structure, moving team offices to another site. And Shop has wrapped it in an appealing rust-colored steel skin, which will make it less harsh on the eye.
 But it still falls short of the high architectural standards set by the design the city was originally promised. And too many questions remain unanswered about the overall plan -- in particular, when and whether Mr. Ratner's company, Forest City Ratner, will ever build the surrounding buildings, and, assuming it does, who will design them. Without them the cohesion of the original plan falls apart.
 The brilliance of Mr. Gehry's approach was not about the aesthetics of any particular building; it lay in the careful arrangement of diverse urban elements on a tight urban site. As in his design work on some of his early houses, Mr. Gehry began this project by breaking down the development program into a series of discrete forms -- arena, residential and commercial towers, public zones -- and then carefully reassembling them, a bit like a child playing with building blocks. The towers set around the arena became a way to hide its bulk. And the collisions among forms made for a number of startling urban moments: views between buildings that opened directly into the arena, a public park draped over the arena's roof.
 The final design did not satisfy many local activists, who felt it was out of scale with the surrounding neighborhoods, but it was a work of genuine urban complexity, drawing strength from the tensions created by the vibrant mix of elements.
 The design by Shop and Ellerbe Becket tries to recapture some of that energy and relate the building to the neighborhoods around it. That rust-colored skin, woven out of weathered-steel panels, has the look of worn snakeskin; it is perforated with small openings that will make it glow at night, and it has a toughness that should fit well into its gritty setting. 
 The architects have set back the upper portion of the facade to break down the structure's scale, and laid out a series of retail shops extending along Flatbush Avenue, the area's main commercial strip. They have also replicated Mr. Gehry's big glass windows along Flatbush, which will allow drivers to peer right through the lobby to the scoreboard suspended above the court. 
 Still, the larger project remains worrisome. In Mr. Gehry's original design, all of the structures were conceived as part of a single cohesive scheme. (All five of the buildings' foundations, for example, would have to have been built at the same time.) To defer additional costs, Mr. Ratner has divided up the design. The arena will be built first, and then, he says, the foundations for the residential and commercial buildings will be dug, once he is ready to start the next stage of construction. 
 This risks producing an oddly clunky composition. Although Mr. Ratner says he still plans to build the towers, possibly hiring an architect for the first one by the end of the year, the current design was clearly conceived to be able to stand alone, and it is hard to see how it would be integrated into a larger, convincing urban whole. Despite Mr. Ratner's reassurances, it is also possible that one or two of the towers will never be built, which would take us back to square one.
 And then, of course, there is the arena itself. Mr. Gehry took great care to disguise the ubiquitous corporate suites to create a more intimate space, tucking them into the ends of the arena and draping balconies over them. He also designed a ceiling that seemed to press down into the room, focusing the energy onto the court.
 The new stadium has fewer suites (they are harder to sell in a poor economy), but they have become more prominent. And the room feels more conventional.
 It is probably the best Mr. Ratner can do, given time and money constraints. But his problems, sadly, are now our problems too. And they may force us to live for decades with what is ultimately a compromised design.

HEADLINE: The Race for Comptroller

 BODY:
The job of New York City comptroller comes with a big number: about $80 billion. That is the total value of the five pensions the comptroller oversees, constituting the country's largest municipal pension system. With a staff of over 700, the comptroller audits how city agencies spend taxpayer money. Comptroller William C. Thompson Jr.'s decision to run for mayor has created a spirited race heading into Tuesday's primary. Among Democrats, a runoff is likely between the top two finishers since polls suggest that no candidate will capture the 40 percent of the vote needed to win outright. The comptroller's position has been seen as a springboard to higher office, though the last to achieve that was Abraham D. Beame.
 Questions
 The New York Times submitted the following questions to the major-party candidates, seeking answers no longer than 100 words. The responses were edited for length. 
 How would you insulate the city's pension system from political influence, insider deals and other corruption?
 MELINDA R. KATZ, Council member, Queens: I strongly support the ban on ''placement agents,'' who are nothing more than lobbyists who inject politics into our pension system to gain access to investment funds, extracting exorbitant fees not for their financial expertise but for their political connections. Additionally, I would increase transparency by registering all of the pension fund investments online and in real time -- so they are not hidden on hard-to-find balance sheets.
 JOHN C. LIU, Council member, Queens: I have pledged to ban contributions from anyone with business before the office and service providers to the pension fund, and call on my rivals to do the same. Disclosure is also key. Lobbyists will be required to register, and we will make those relationships known. We will also overhaul the procurement process and substantially curtail no-bid contracts.
 DAVID I. WEPRIN, Council member, Queens: One of the first things I would do is a self-assessment. No office should be immune from a self-evaluation to determine if policies, procedures and practice can be updated and improved. These ''open'' measures will help insulate the system from undue political influence.
 DAVID YASSKY, Council member, Brooklyn: Complete information about the funds will be available online, including a list of investment managers, their returns and their fees. The Hevesi scandal showed the need to restrict ''placement agents,'' and only experienced securities professionals will be permitted to market investments to the funds. Most important, I will staff the comptroller's office with top-tier professionals.
 JOSEPH A. MENDOLA, Brokerage firm lawyer: Hire a comptroller who will not use the office as a steppingstone to run for mayor, who has professional money-management experience and will make investments based on investment principles, not patronage. List online all brokers and consultants hired, their investment performance, political contributions they have made and the amount the city had paid them. List online monthly performance results for each of the 5 pension funds.
 How should the city's investments take into account social or political concerns? Name a company or fund the city should divest from, and why.
 MELINDA R. KATZ: First and foremost, we must earn the strongest risk-adjusted return possible for pensioners. But the choice between good returns and social responsibility is a false dilemma. I strongly support the decision to divest from two companies with business ties to Iran (Oil and Natural Gas Limited and PetroChina Company) and will continue efforts to divest from eight other companies identified as having substantial ties to Iran. The lack of transparency among our pension fund investments makes it difficult to pinpoint other companies or funds we should divest from. As comptroller, I will change that.
 JOHN C. LIU: The comptroller's primary responsibility is to maximize investment returns in order to protect our workers and retirees, while minimizing the burden on taxpayers. Social, political and environmental concerns can be addressed via pension investments, through shareholder activism or even outright divestment. Addressing these concerns does not impede the fiduciary responsibility because in today's marketplace, there are many alternative investments with similar risk-reward profiles. I would take a careful look at divesting from companies that do substantial business with the Iranian government.
 DAVID I. WEPRIN: The city should set an example with fiscally prudent investments which are also socially responsible. Just like investors pressured for divestment from companies that supported apartheid, so should the comptroller's office award investment in entities that appreciate these concerns. I would evaluate all the current funds the city does business with to determine if they further these same objectives.
 DAVID YASSKY: The primary objective is to ensure a competitive rate of return so we can meet obligations to retirees without drawing on taxpayers. We should also seek investments to stimulate the city's economy, such as in bioscience or green technology. The funds should avoid investment in companies whose activities are directly contrary to the interests or fundamental values of New Yorkers. I would divest from companies doing business in Iran and Sudan.
 JOSEPH A. MENDOLA: When I am comptroller, investment decisions will be based on maximizing returns and minimizing risk. We will never invest in Iran or Darfur or similar nefarious enterprises. But ''socially responsible investing'' is really a tool employed by politicians to curry favor with special-interest groups so that when they run for mayor, these groups will support them. To me, socially responsible investing means investing smartly so taxpayers do not have to bail out the pension funds.
 Many of you have spoken about wielding the comptroller's audit powers to root out waste in the city's budget. Tell us which two city agencies are the best candidates for scrutiny.
 MELINDA R. KATZ: I would start with the Department of Education. D.O.E. contracts routinely surpass their expected costs-- one out of every five goes over cost by 25 percent or more. The Xerox Corporation had a contract that started at $1 million but skyrocketed to $68 million. These outside contracts, many of which are not competitively bid, have ballooned in recent years. I would also scrutinize the Economic Development Corporation, whose budget has increased by nearly $100 million over two years and whose line item for rent and ''other operating expenses'' went from $60 million in 2008 to over $90 million for 2010.
 JOHN C. LIU: I would place an immediate focus on the Industrial Development Agency and the Economic Development Corporation, two agencies which are often involved in assisting development and corporate entities but are little understood by the general public. Subsidies at the expense of taxpayers are often not clearly justified after the fact. Examining the effectiveness, or lack thereof, of tax incentives, abatement and bonuses given by these agencies in light of the actual benefits they bring to taxpayers undoubtedly will save substantial sums for the city. In addition, large amounts of waste can be eliminated by curtailing unnecessary use of midyear budget modifications.
 DAVID I. WEPRIN: Two city agencies that are in dire need of scrutiny are the Department of Buildings and the Department of Education. The copious numbers of ''no bid'' sole-source contracts doled out by the city is alarming. Glaring sums are being awarded without oversight. The D.O.E. sole-source budget alone is billions -- with no basis for comparison on whether the contracts are competitive. I advocate using the audit powers of the comptroller's office to examine contracts with an eye toward prudence, value and feasibility. Contractors also should be selected on ability to complete tasks without running over budget or afoul of criminal violations.
 DAVID YASSKY: I see the comptroller's audit staff as an in-house management consultant for city agencies, and I will direct the staff to scour each agency's budget and recommend ways to increase productivity by at least 10 percent. The Department of Education and the N.Y.P.D. are two candidates for scrutiny. In auditing the Education Department, we will seek to reduce spending on testing and outside evaluators and increase spending in the classroom. In auditing the Police Department, we will seek to achieve savings by reducing overtime and by identifying positions that can be filled by civilians rather than uniformed officers.
 JOSEPH A. MENDOLA: One agency that has traditionally escaped oversight is the Department of Education. We need to look carefully at how we are spending our education dollars. In addition, one aspect of each agency that I will look at is the hiring of outside consultants and so-called experts.We need to make sure that this practice is economical for the city and ensure that those being hired are not chosen because of some inside connection, patronage agreement or political contribution. Consultants must be vetted in a transparent manner so that back-room dealings will not remain secret.

HEADLINE: A Belt, a Brief, and a Man's Heart Skips a Beat

BYLINE: By DAVID COLMAN

 BODY:
IF you're looking for some good news about the economy -- and who, pray tell, is not? -- here you go. Men have become besotted with accessories.
 Belts. Bags. Bracelets. In the latest evidence of Modern Man's indulgence of the self, sales of men's accessories in the first half of 2009 were up more than 7 percent over the same period in 2008, according to NPD Group, which tracks retail sales. (Women's sales were down 11 percent.)
 The best sellers seem only too fitting: wallets (to pump up your currency) are up 30 percent; belts (to slim down your debt) are up 38 percent. And there are plenty of other hot spots, from well-known and expensive brands to obscure and thrifty ones. Pricey designer sneakers are walking out the door at Barneys New York and Jeffrey New York. Men's bags, sales of which are up 14 percent, are among the year's top sellers at Gucci and Prada. 
 In Massachusetts, at the venerable Alden Shoe Company, a sales drop in its 1950s-style banker shoes at traditional shops has been offset by Alden's newfound popularity at trendy stores like Steven Alan in New York. On Long Island, at the 127-year-old sailmaker Wm. J. Mills & Co., nearly all of the growth in the company's preppy (and suddenly fashionable) line of canvas bags is from sales to men.
 ''That's absolutely the case here,'' said Robert Duffy, the president of Marc Jacobs, who said that the NPD numbers square with his own. ''We already shipped our fall cashmere stuff to our stores -- hats, gloves, scarves -- and it's selling like crazy, better than last year, better than the year before, better than ever. I don't know why people in Bal Harbour are buying cashmere hats in August, but ... anyway, it's mostly guys. It's not women.''
 And modesty in either price or style does not seem to have been a draw, as Tom Kalenderian, the men's fashion director of Barneys, noted. ''It was a lot of impulsive fashion items,'' he said, sounding slightly puzzled. ''Bags, shoes, jewelry, whether it's some icon on a leather cord or a tie bar, which all of a sudden everyone has to have. And eyewear has been explosive. In a season when you would think price matters, the most high-end eyewear sold the best.''
 The overall figures are remarkable. Far from representing a frivolous drop in the retail bucket, sales of men's accessories jumped from $7 billion to $7.5 billion, increasing the men's percentage of the overall accessories market from 27 to 31 percent. The figures do not even include neckties and scarves, tracked by NPD as apparel, or footwear, a separate category. 
 It's enough to make you think the C.D.C. should be looking for some strange, contagious virus that seizes men with a sudden mania to accessorize. But actually, to change metaphors, it is more like a rogue wave, with several waves coming together to make a monster. First there is the plain fact that men's accouterments tend to do well in lean times, as guys realize that they can freshen up their look thriftily with a new hat or satchel, which, unlike new clothes, can be used every day.
 The most fashion-forward regalia is doing well because, as Mr. Duffy explained, ''accessories are impulse buys.'' With many men cutting back on more standard luxuries like vacations, they are invariably drawn to minor indulgences (just as sales of candy and movie tickets have been up). However flashy, any pair of Raf Simons futuristic designer sneakers are still far less ostentatious than the most modest new car.
 Mr. Duffy also offered that, in his experience, men don't shop the way the women do. ''Women are very savvy,'' he said. ''They'll see something they want, but they'll wait for it to go on sale. Men, if they see something they like, and if it's right, they get it. They don't want to come back.''
 The final piece of the puzzle is, quite simply, that guys have finally caught on to the accessory's power as a coup de maitre that, style-wise, separates the men from the boys.
 ''Anyone can buy an outfit off a mannequin,'' said Marshal Cohen, NPD's chief analyst. ''Having good accessories means you've got your game on.''
 This is even more true now that good, stylish clothes are so easy to find, there's barely any sport left in shopping for them.
 ''With clothing, everything in fashion is just a rehashed version of something vintage,'' said Martin Keehn, a men's wear designer who is fastidious about seeking out accessories with flair -- just the right '70s sunglasses or understated gold necklace. ''They're a more subtle way of setting myself apart from everyone else. And they're safe and modular. It's just like growing up; you could dress as normal as any other kid, but then you put New Wave sunglasses on and you were Devo.''
 Maybe all you need is new underwear. While overall sales of men's briefs and boxers are down nationwide, sales of the most colorful, graphic and high-tech briefs by brands like Diesel and 2(x)ist are up markedly at InternationalJock.com, one of the largest underwear sites. Thanks to those billboard waistbands, such briefs have become as much an accessory as any belt.
 But where does it end? Is it overkill to sport a belt and a Diesel waistband? ''I was talking about that last week with a guy at Project who was into these belt buckles,'' Mr. Cohen said, referring to a large men's wear trade show. ''I said, 'Aren't you going to detract from the belt and buckle if you have the underwear coming out?' And he said, 'No, I'm blasting the billboard on the back; now I'm looking to enhance the front.' ''
 After all, the guy told him, he wanted everyone to check him out coming into the room, not just leaving. 
 Strangely enough, that does actually make sense.

HEADLINE: When Home Shrinks

BYLINE: By HARVEY ARATON

 BODY:
IN the quaint central Connecticut town of East Haddam, Bill and Rose-Marie Evans built a theme park for their three children. Their property included a pool, a hot tub, a swing set, a trampoline, a paved basketball court and more than enough yard to host neighborhood soccer and kickball games.
 They had expanded the ranch house they bought in 2001, turning it into a 3,000-square-foot home with room indoors for games like pool, table tennis and Foosball, making it a prime sleepover destination. ''The master bedroom was on the first floor,'' Mr. Evans said. ''There were three bedrooms and a second family room upstairs. The kids had 1,200 square feet to themselves.''
 But then in mid-June, the moving van arrived, and the Evanses left behind their own personal vacation land and squeezed uncomfortably into a 1,200-square-foot rental, while they began building a marginally bigger home. The couple had decided that with the economy uncertain, they had to conserve money and live more modestly. 
 Leaving the home they once believed would be theirs into retirement was a painful decision, one many baby boomer families are facing. It's an issue that especially resonates in suburbia, where highly taxed, stressed-out parents wrestle with the prospect of moving sooner than they had planned. But children can be uncomfortable with decisions that change their notions of security, and their unhappiness forces parents to consider what they do -- or don't -- owe their offspring. 
 In the Evans household, the oldest child was upset about the change, even though he is a college student at the University of Central Florida. ''We always believed that was going to be the place we would come back to with our own kids for Christmas and Thanksgiving,'' said Andrew Inman, 19, who, along with his sister, Brittany, 17, is Mrs. Evans's child from a previous marriage. ''We kind of felt lied to.''
 Baby boomers are already driving a new market for smaller, less expensive homes, according to Stephen Melman, the director of economic services for the National Association of Home Builders in Washington. In a recent member survey, 59 percent of builders nationwide said they were planning to or were already significantly downscaling from the McMansion era.
 ''Many boomers seem to be thinking they are going to do it eventually, they may as well do it now while they need the money for tuition or because there's just less money available,'' Mr. Melman said. 
 Under the pseudonym Mr. Go To Retirement, Mark Patterson has blogged extensively about the benefits of downsizing, but said that many parents, responding to his blog posts, have said they have difficulty relinquishing the family home, even when there obviously is no more practical need for it.
 ''There are so many boomers struggling with this concept,'' he said. ''I talk about my own family, how we purchased a second home in Kentucky, half the size, and spent a lot of time there on holidays with our three sons, kind of a 'Guess what, guys, we're going to be selling the house you grew up in.' '' 
 Mr. Patterson, a patent lawyer, said he hasn't taken the plunge because his three young adult sons are so attached to the family home, on a golf course near Nashville.
 ''I saw how they reacted a while back when my father sold a home that they loved visiting in North Carolina, '' Mr. Patterson said. ''There was a real sense of loss, a real sadness, and I could see it again when we started talking about downsizing ourselves. It's going to be disruptive emotionally for them, so I told them that it wouldn't happen until they were all out of school and comfortable in their own space.''
 Children do not always resist a parent's decision to move on, and can be part of the solution when finances are difficult. When Jayme Howard's divorce left her unable to maintain her 1,400-square-foot home in south Denver, she tried to sell it. With no offers by July, she asked her 21-year-old son, a college student in Denver, to move back home with his girlfriend.
 ''They're helping me out, paying rent, and it's cheaper than their apartment was,'' said Ms. Howard, 52, a postal worker. ''I'm hoping we can do this for another two years and then I can sell for a decent price.''
 In Ocean Township on the Jersey Shore, Jane Graver, 52, a single mother with two sons, ages 19 and 17, recently sold a 3,000-square-foot split-level home and rented a house in a nearby town that is half the size of the one she sold, with just enough room for her, the boys and her tea business, Ducky Life. Because she also vacated her office space, she anticipates significant monthly savings. 
 Her older son, Holden Sandlar, just started his sophomore year at the Rochester Institute of Technology and has already told Ms. Graver that he does not intend to move home after college. Her younger son, Miles Sandlar, will graduate next June from the high school he has attended and has been promised by his mother that he will get one full year of college to visit her in the house she is renting.
 ''After that, he'll have to figure it out,'' Ms. Graver said, describing herself as an ''old hippie free-spirit,'' who hopes to settle in Vermont eventually. She believes that her sons, after finishing their education, will be resourceful enough to lay their own roots. ''Moving when your kids are younger is much simpler,'' she said. ''But in this case, the boys have been part of the process.'' They helped her choose the new house.
 ''I think by going through this with me and actually helping, they have been able to realize how much easier this is going to be for me,'' she said, ''and knowing that, it's made the loss of their home and the more material things in their lives seem not as important.''
 The changes involved in moving were more painful for the Evans family. Mr. Evans, 46, who works as a building manager for a local lumberyard, said he has seen too much of his company's business disappear to be comfortable.
 ''I've seen too many guys sitting around with nothing to do,'' he said. ''If I were to lose my job, we couldn't possibly have maintained the old house on one salary. It made me worry and think, do we really need three living rooms?''
 His wife agreed, especially after she watched her brother and his wife, who live in Tacoma, Wash., lose their jobs. 
 Valued at $435,000 two years ago, the Evanses' house sold for $305,000. The Evanses had to tap into savings for closing expenses, while the timing of the move required a hefty emotional cost. 
 Mr. Inman, the oldest child, had just returned from his freshman year at college and was stunned to learn he would soon be sharing a dorm-size space with his 12-year-old brother, William Evans. Sitting at the dining room table wedged into a narrow area facing the kitchen on a recent evening with his parents and brother, he said it was the message more than the move that reduced him to tears.
 ''It was being told that you're only a part-time resident now so you don't get your own space,'' he said. ''No child wants to feel that way. You want to feel that you have a place at home that's always there for you if you need it.''
 Faced with the prospect of an unhappy college student as his summerlong roommate, William volunteered to sleep on the living room couch.
 ''He's my brother, I wanted him to be happy,'' William said. 
 Brittany, 17, who was already reeling from a rejection by the Coast Guard, had to come to terms with going to a local community college and living in a home that feels to her like a tenement. 
 ''We're all in each other's space and can get on each other's nerves,'' she said. ''No matter where you are, you can hear what everyone is doing.'' 
 Worse, her dream of a high school graduation party at the home she loved was dashed, when the purchasing family, relocating from New Jersey, was unable to compromise on the closing date.
 ''Brittany was angry, very hurt,'' said Mrs. Evans, 46, a music teacher in the town's school district and the author of a recently published novel aimed at 9- to 12-year-olds, ''The Unexpected Adventure at East Haddam High.'' 
 ''It was toughest on Brittany,'' Mrs. Evans said. ''I tried family meetings. I asked: 'How do you feel? Let's talk about it.' It was: 'Why do you care how we feel? You made the decision without us.' I'd always had a 'Gilmore Girls' relationship with my daughter. It's been difficult to see her so unhappy and distant.''
 Nodding, Mr. Inman said, ''You couldn't talk to her without her screaming at you.''
 Emphasizing the point, Brittany extended her early evening out with friends to avoid the dining area interview. On the telephone the next day, she didn't sound quite ready for rapprochement.
 ''I mean, I understand the financial situation, of course, but it was two weeks before graduation, so many things going on, and your parents decide to move you,'' she said. ''I had friends whose parents took their homes off the market just to ease their stress during senior year. Moving right before graduation is not what you want.''
 They are all trying to move forward. William is back in the bedroom, although his sleepovers with friends are usually elsewhere. His brother has returned to college. Brittany has been enjoying her new community college classes and trying to find a day job that will ease her claustrophobia. 
 In the slow construction market, the family has been assured completion of their new home by November. The builder had not worked in almost a year and the various contractors had plenty of time on their hands as well.
 ''They all came way down on their prices because they needed the work,'' Mrs. Evans said. They are building their new home for $250,000, allowing them to clear $55,000 in the move. 
 Because the rental is less expensive than their old home, Mr. and Mrs. Evans have been able to save money for the last few months. And when they move to their new home, they are anticipating significant utilities savings.
 ''It'll be about 1,350 square feet with a seasonal room that hopefully we'll be able to winterize at some point,'' Mr. Evans said.
 Like their children, they were not happy about leaving so much behind, and each had a favorite amenity that they could not part with. For Mr. Evans, it was the pool table, now in the basement of the rental. For Mrs. Evans, it was the piano, now wedged into their living room. 
 Everything else had to be stored, or surrendered.

HEADLINE: S.E.C. Defends Deal in Merrill Takeover

BYLINE: By ZACHERY KOUWE

 BODY:
The Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday defended its proposed $33 million settlement with Bank of America over bonuses paid to Merrill Lynch executives just before the bank took over Merrill last year. 
 The S.E.C. said in a federal court filing that the settlement was ''fair'' and ''reasonable'' and that it had lacked enough evidence to charge individuals at the bank with misleading shareholders about the $3.6 billion in bonuses paid to Merrill employees.
 In its own legal filing, Bank of America maintained its previous stance that ''there is no evidence that any individual is culpable'' and said it had agreed to the settlement with the S.E.C. to avoid a protracted public court fight that could potentially damage its reputation. 
 On Aug. 25, Judge Jed S. Rakoff of the United States District Court in Manhattan refused to approve the proposed settlement until he received an explanation about why the S.E.C. had failed to pursue charges against individuals at the bank.
 Even as Bank of America was defending itself in federal court, it moved a day closer to facing potential charges from Andrew M. Cuomo, the New York attorney general, regarding the Merrill acquisition.
 The bank's lawyers sharply rejected an assertion by the attorney general's office that the bank was hiding behind attorney-client privilege to avoid disclosing crucial facts.
 In a strongly worded letter, the bank's lawyer, Lewis J. Liman of Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen & Hamilton, wrote that Bank of America was ''extremely surprised and disappointed'' when it received a letter on Tuesday from the attorney general's office, and said that its basic premise was wrong.
 Mr. Cuomo's office has been investigating several aspects of the takeover of Merrill, including when and how the bank had decided to disclose unexpected losses at Merrill as well as the bonuses paid to Merrill employees.
 The letter on Tuesday from David A. Markowitz, the chief of Mr. Cuomo's Investor Protection Bureau, said that ''attorney-client privilege is hindering this office's ability to make fair and fully informed decisions as to what charges, if any, to bring and whether individual Bank of America officers should be charged.''
 In its response, Bank of America disputed that assertion on several fronts, writing that ''because Bank of America did not violate the law, it has not offered reliance on legal advice as a defense.''
 The letter, addressed to Eric O. Corngold, Mr. Cuomo's executive deputy attorney general for economic justice, also said that Bank of America had offered several times to meet with Mr. Cuomo's office to explain its side of the case but had been rejected each time.
 On Tuesday, Mr. Cuomo's office said it was nearing a decision on whether to file fraud charges against Bank of America or any of its executives. It has given the bank until Monday to provide details on the Merrill deal.
 In seeking approval to buy Merrill Lynch last year, Bank of America told investors that Merrill would not pay year-end bonuses without the bank's consent. But in its complaint filed Aug. 3 in federal court in Manhattan, the S.E.C. said Bank of America had already authorized Merrill to pay bonuses and had not shared that information with shareholders.

HEADLINE: In Florida, Vestiges Of the Boom

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
On the corner of Flamingo Road and Pink Flamingo Lane, beyond the putting green, the crystalline lagoon and the Sawgrass Mills mall, a soaring monument to the great condominium bust bakes under the Florida sun. 
 The Tao Sawgrass, as the twin-towered complex is known, was built on the western fringes of Fort Lauderdale with easy money from the now tottering condo king of American finance: Corus Bancshares of Chicago. Only about 50 of the 396 units have been sold.
 The 26-story Tao -- begun in 2006, just as the Florida real estate market imploded -- is one of the many troubled condominium projects that have mired Corus in red ink and now threaten its survival. Federal authorities are racing to broker a sale of Corus to avert yet another costly banking collapse. 
 After failing to find a buyer for the entire company, regulators are moving to cleave the bank in two and sell its banking operations and condominium loans separately. The hope is to clinch a deal by the end of the month. 
 Some big-time real estate investors are circling, among them Thomas J. Barrack, who first made his fortune in the aftermath of the savings and loan crisis; Barry S. Sternlicht, the man behind the Starwood empire; Jay Sugarman of iStar Financial, the public real estate giant; and New York developer Stephen M. Ross, sometimes called the King of Columbus Circle, in league with Lubert-Adler, a big property investor in Philadelphia. 
 Whatever the outcome, Corus will go down as the great enabler of condo madness, and its travails are a harbinger of the pain yet to come in the troubled world of commercial real estate. More than any other condo lender, Corus epitomized the easy lending and lax oversight of the go-go years -- and the pain of the ensuing bust. Its share price, which was nearly $13 in February of 2008, has plummeted into the land of penny stocks, closing at 25 cents Wednesday. 
 Corus barreled into hot markets like California, Florida and Nevada and then kept lending as those markets boiled over. Rather than diversify, it concentrated its lending bets by financing only a handful of big, risky projects. And it poured its idle cash into a small group of other banks and financial companies that were upended when the crisis struck. 
 The primary regulator of Corus, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, failed to sound the alarm until Corus was deeply troubled. 
 ''They are the perfect analogy of a boom-bust bank,'' said Jack McCabe, the head of a real estate research and consulting firm in South Florida. Corus executives, he said, behaved more like property speculators than bankers. 
 The failure of Corus would cost an already strained Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation billions. It would also underscore the wave of troubled commercial real estate loans now threatening to crash down on much of the American banking industry. Construction and land loans are now the biggest problem for hundreds of deeply troubled lenders and pose far greater dangers than commercial loans or home mortgages, according to Foresight Analytics, a banking industry research firm. 
 Many analysts see trouble ahead. 
 ''The first big wave of losses for the banks were on loans to home builders and condo developers in once hot markets,'' said Andrew McGee, a consultant at Oliver Wyman in New York. ''Banks now are worried that office buildings, hotels and malls in areas hardest hit by the downturn are going bad too.''
 Corus was not always so condo crazy. It used to be a sleepy family-run affair known as River Forest Bancorp. Then, in 1984, Robert J. Glickman took over from his father, Joseph C. Glickman, and began transforming the bank into a powerhouse in construction loans. Corus shut its student lending business, its trust operations and all but a handful of its Chicago area branches. It began catering to condo developers across the nation, offering developers quick loan approvals and attractive interest rates. Corus soon fanned out into hot markets like Atlanta, Las Vegas, Los Angeles and Miami. As the property market exploded, so did Corus. Its assets reached nearly $10 billion in 2006. But almost all the loans were tied to the condo market, and nearly 40 percent were for more than $100 million.
 Robert Glickman kept reaching for more. Just off the Las Vegas Strip, Corus single-handedly financed a $108.2 million luxury development called Streamline Tower.
 In Sunrise, Fla., locals shook their heads as Corus provided $126.3 million for the construction of the Tao, doubting that a luxury condo development on the edge of the Everglades could lure wealthy tenants.
 And in downtown Miami, Corus financed the Ivy and the Mint, adjacent properties that were competing for the same buyers. 
 ''It was like building two Wal-Marts next door to each other and thinking you would double sales,'' Mr. McCabe said of the Miami projects. 
 Then, of course, the bottom fell out. By late 2007, the share price of Corus was under attack on Wall Street. But Robert Glickman, whose family then controlled nearly half of Corus, rebuffed offers to sell the bank. Instead, Corus paid a special dividend that netted the Glickman family about $25 million, even though the payout ate into the bank's reserves. By mid-2008, Corus was losing money and stopped making loans altogether.
 Finally, in early 2009, federal regulators ordered Corus to raise capital or put itself up for sale. It was unable to do either. In late June, the bank reported that its entire capital base had been wiped out. Since then, its auditors, Ernst & Young, have walked away, and Nasdaq has warned that it may delist Corus shares.
 Mr. Glickman and his father, the chairman of Corus, left the company in April and recently sold their remaining shares for pennies on the dollar. 
 Corus officials did not return phone calls seeking comment.

HEADLINE: After Fed Report, Shares Extend Rally to 4 Days

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The stock market extended its gains to a fourth day after the Federal Reserve said the economy was stabilizing.
 Industrial and financial stocks led the advance Wednesday, which lifted the Dow Jones industrial average 50 points by the closing bell. It had been up 80 points earlier in the day. 
 Stocks briefly surrendered their gains after the release of the Fed's report on regional economies, which also found that consumer spending would rise but only because of car purchases linked to the government's brief cash-for-clunkers program.
 The prolonged slump in consumer spending has been one of the most serious points of worry for economists, and the Fed's warning about it deflated some of the market's optimism. About 70 percent of the economy depends on spending by consumers.
 Matt Lloyd, chief investment strategist at Advisors Asset Management, said investors were jittery after the Fed's report because many traders feared a correction after a 50 percent surge in the market in the last six months.
 ''To me, there is no conviction'' behind the market's recent gains, Mr. Lloyd said.
 The Dow rose 49.88 points, or 0.5 percent, to close at 9,547.22. The index has added 267 points, or 2.9 percent, in four days.
 The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 7.98 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,033.37, while the Nasdaq composite index rose 22.62, or 1.1 percent, to 2,060.39.
 Jeff Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL Financial Services, said a break in the rally could be good for the market to keep stocks from racing too high.
 ''I think we're maybe due for a little bit of consolidation,'' he said.
 Mr. Kleintop also said that as more investors began to expect an improvement in the economy, ''economic data has lost a lot of its power to really move the market around.'' 
 Light, sweet crude rose 20 cents to settle at $71.31 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Gold fell to $992.30.
 Industrial shares were the biggest gainers, as investors bet that higher commodity prices would translate to increased profits if the economy strengthened. The weaker dollar also makes the goods of American exporters cheaper outside the country.
 Caterpillar was among the strongest advancers of the 30 stocks that make up the Dow industrials. Its shares rose $1.44, or 3.1 percent, to $48.41.
 Boeing rose $1.03, or 2.1 percent, to close at $50.53, while General Electric rose 37 cents, or 2.6 percent, to $14.87. Textron rose 43 cents, to $18.41.
 Bond prices mostly rose. The Treasury's 10-year note rose 3/32, to 101 9/32. The yield fell to 3.47 percent, from 3.48 percent late Tuesday.
 Haag Sherman, chief investment officer at Salient Partners in Houston, said investors' demand for stronger returns was weighing on the dollar.
 Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.8 percent. Britain's FTSE 100 rose 1.2 percent, Germany's DAX index rose 1.7 percent, and France's CAC-40 advanced 1.3 percent.
 Following are the results of Wednesday's Treasury auction of four-week bills:

HEADLINE: For OPEC, Current Oil Price Is Just Right

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

DATELINE: VIENNA 

 BODY:
Has the world found its Goldilocks price for oil at $70 a barrel -- not too high for consumers, not too low for producers?
 For members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, who were meeting here late Wednesday, today's price seems just about right. For consumers, high prices obviously mean more expensive gas. But they also help make investments in renewable fuels competitive and spur the development of costly sources of oil, like deepwater reserves. 
 Striking the right balance in the price of oil has always been one of the biggest sticking points in the relations between producers and consumers. 
 During the 1990s, that price was around $25 a barrel. But in recent years, the consensus has frayed. Concerns about oil supplies, faster growth in demand from Asia and fear of future shortages, as well as a move to invest in commodities, have all propelled prices to record highs.
 After the global economic collapse, the world is once more looking for a new equilibrium price. Producers need high prices to finance their budgets, while consumers want prices that are low enough not to derail economic growth.
 ''For the moment they are in the sweet spot in terms of prices,'' said Bhushan Bahree, an analyst at IHS Cambridge Energy Research Associates. ''Both the producers and the consumers are content. Nobody is complaining.''
 In December, after the financial markets tumbled, oil fell as low as $33 a barrel, and producers feared that a prolonged period of low prices would follow. OPEC's producers have since stuck to a rigorous playbook: cut supplies, maintain discipline and hope that a global recovery will push demand back up again.
 OPEC's strategy worked. Producers managed to prop up prices again; they have gained about 60 percent this year. Oil prices in New York rose 21 cents, to $71.31, ahead of the meeting.
 The strategy has been spearheaded by Saudi Arabia, the country with the biggest production capacity. 
 Taking the lead at OPEC's gathering here, Saudi Arabia said that it saw no need to cut production at this time and risk jeopardizing the economic recovery. OPEC decided to keep its output level unchanged, stressing ''the downside risks associated with the extremely fragile recovery,'' the cartel said in a statement released after the late-night session. 
 ''At $70 or $80 a barrel, this is the right price for all consumers and producers,'' said Abdalla al-Attiyeh, the energy minister for Qatar. ''I believe this price will help strengthen the world economy. It will help.''
 Earlier this year, Saudi Arabia said it considered $75 a barrel to be a fair price. Speaking about the current price of oil, Ali al-Naimi, the Saudi oil minister, told reporters Wednesday, ''We are happy where it is and it's going to be there for a while. We don't have the slightest worry.''
 For consumers, lower oil prices would be a mixed blessing. They would lead to lower gasoline prices, but they would also risk putting into question investments in alternative fuels and renewable power that the Obama administration and the European Union are encouraging.
 Instead, Western petroleum executives say they want prices to stay high so they can keep investing in unconventional sources of oil in places like the Arctic or the deep offshore, and to forestall a potential shortfall in supply. As a result, few have called on OPEC to add to the supply to bring down prices.
 Unleaded regular gasoline currently sells at an average $2.57 a gallon in the United States, according to AAA.
 In Vienna, many delegates know the current situation might not last long.
 As the recovery starts to take shape, there is still considerable uncertainty about the direction of oil prices. Over the summer, commodity and equity markets rose as investors bet on a faster recovery. But some analysts warn that the present equilibrium is built on shaky grounds.
 ''The explanation of $65 to $75 a barrel has nothing to do with oil but with the expectation that the global economy rebounds,'' said Edward L. Morse, the head of economic research at LCM Commodities in New York. ''The risk is that the wind goes out of the sails of commodities and equities, and a sell-off could bring oil prices below $60 a barrel.''
 Mr. Morse points out that oil markets are currently bound by two powerful bookends. On one hand, the appetite of investors for commodities, including oil, remains strong, and could prevent prices from falling too much.
 On the other hand, OPEC's members currently hold spare capacity of at least six million barrels a day, a level not seen since the late 1990s. Most of that is in Saudi Arabia, and the rest is shared among Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and a few other countries.
 That high level of spare capacity, which can be brought on line rapidly if demand rises, gives Saudi Arabia plenty of clout within OPEC.
 One factor OPEC is counting on is that demand for oil will eventually pick up as the economy recovers. According to a report by IHS Cambridge Energy Research Associates, global oil demand is expected to grow next year for the first time in two years, by 900,000 barrels a day, and eventually return to its 2007 level of 86.5 million barrels a day by 2012.
 ''Economic growth is the name of the game,'' said Mr. Naimi, the Saudi oil minister, who was driving a new Mercedes hybrid while here.
 One topic to be discussed by OPEC was how well its members were complying with their quotas. With prices rising, the group's discipline has frayed in recent months. Some producers, like Angola, have been pumping more oil than promised. Bringing everyone back in line could prove contentious, analysts said.
 Over the last year, OPEC had agreed to reduce its production by 4.2 million barrels a day. Compliance with that target has reached 80 percent, analysts said, but OPEC delegates said producers were now abiding with only around 70 percent of the agreed cuts.

HEADLINE: Finding the Path to Success by Changing Directions

BYLINE: By BRENT BOWERS

 BODY:
THE path to entrepreneurial success is not always obvious. In fact, in the case of Scale Computing of Indianapolis, failure was the springboard. 
 Jeff Ready, the chief executive of Scale Computing, and his business partners said they originally thought they would use the artificial-intelligence technology they had developed at a previous start-up company to forecast stock prices and make a fortune as hedge fund gurus.
 But by the time they had built their ''magic box,'' the economy had turned grim and they were unable to raise the $100 million they thought they needed. It was only after potential customers rejected other software technology ideas that they realized their device could be marketed as a more practical product: a data storage system. Two years later, the orders are pouring in. 
 Andrew Zacharakis, a professor of entrepreneurship at Babson College outside Boston, said Scale Computing's owners followed a classic entrepreneurial path of shifting gears as necessary to seize real, as opposed to perceived, opportunities. 
 Mr. Ready (pronounced REE-dee) and his partners at Scale Computing, Scott Loughmiller, the chief product officer, and Ehren Maedge, its chief operating officer, are serial entrepreneurs. They created their first venture, an Internet services provider, in 1996 as college students. The next year, they sold it for $300,000 and formed an Internet advertising company. They sold that in 2001 for $2 million. In 2002, they started a company called Corvigo that fought spam, and sold it two years later for $42.5 million.
 Then, in late 2005, they started a company called Volt Capital with the goal of adapting Corvigo's antispam technology to make stock market forecasts. But they needed much greater data storage space than they could afford to track the short-term fluctuations in the prices of more than 2,000 stocks they were aiming at.
 So they created a Rube Goldberg contraption. ''We built a grid computer by hand,'' Mr. Ready said. ''We had this monster of a device with 400 processors on double-stacked motherboards all mounted in a custom-built rack we had made at a local machine shop.''
 The apparatus required so much energy that it heated up the garage where it was housed to 120 degrees, requiring Mr. Ready and his partners to blast air across it with giant, high-speed fans that made more noise than revved-up race car engines. ''If you stood next to it while it was running, it was a bit frightening, knowing that one misstep would have you chopped up in the fans and dispersed evenly across all the processors,'' Mr. Ready said.
 For all the racket, the machine enabled Mr. Ready and his partners to make successful trades with their own money. Alas, it soon became clear that that they would be unable to reach their goal of raising $100 million for their hedge fund. 
 They were left with a device that had cost them $60,000 to produce and had a storage capacity that rivaled products selling for up to $1 million. But it was so clunky, it did not occur to them to market it. Instead, they cast around for new software technology ideas.
 Potential customers were not interested in their pitches. ''They would say, 'That sounds really great, but what we really could use is something to make shared storage systems cheaper,' '' said Mr. Ready, a 35-year-old father of two girls.
 It took awhile for the message to get through. ''We thought the storage space had far too many big competitors, so we just made note of the request,'' he said. ''But it kept coming up, again and again. It was like people were smacking us around with a fish trying to get our attention about this high cost of storage problem.''
 Finally, they took the hint. In April 2007, they started Scale Computing to develop low-cost ''storage nodes'' of one, two and four terabytesthat could be stacked together as needed to operate as one system.
 In February, they began delivering the nodes, and sales are picking up quickly, they say. Small businesses, hospitals, law firms, school districts and even one Fortune 100 company like the devices because they can buy as few as they want and, as their storage needs grow, add as many as they need at multiple locations.
 Because their systems sell for one-half to one-fifth the price of equivalent products made by giants like Hewlett-Packard and EMC -- the SN4000, Scale Computing's most expensive model, costs $7,000 -- customers can treat the purchases as an operational expense rather than a capital investment, Mr. Ready said.
 ''I've never run a company that gained so much traction so quickly,'' he said. It has grown to 22 employees, and he projects sales of $2 million this year and $8 million in 2010, though he acknowledges that fortunes can change quickly at start-ups, for good or ill.
 He recalled his second venture, Radiate, which was an early pioneer in Internet advertising. Silicon Valley venture capitalists spurned it because it was located in Indiana. (They later moved it to California.) They finally raised $5 million from a Boston firm and went on to build Radiate into a $20 million company so quickly that they had visions of overnight riches.
 Instead, they got caught in the technology crash and were forced to sell Radiate for $2 million. ''I made $652 in the deal on my six years of work, but who's counting?'' Mr. Ready said. ''I had to lay myself off so I could collect unemployment checks.''
 On the other hand, their next company, Corvigo, made all of them wealthy in just 27 months, even though they had founded it on a whim. He was staying at his parents' home in Indiana over the Christmas holiday in 2001 when Mr. Loughmiller, a fellow Hoosier, called him from his family's dairy farm to say his mother was frustrated by all the junk e-mail she was getting.
 ''Clearly, if Scott's mom on the dairy farm had a spam problem, everyone had a spam problem,'' he said. ''Thus, Corvigo was born.''
 In 2003, the venture capital firm, Sequoia Capital, invested $5.5 million in Corvigo. Six months later, in March 2004, Tumbleweed Communications (now part of Axway Inc.) bought it for $41.5 million, netting each of the three partners several million dollars.
 Mr. Zacharakis, of Babson College, said Mr. Ready and his partners exhibited the familiar entrepreneurial trait of nimbleness in changing circumstances.
 ''They take low-cost tests and learn along the way,'' Mr. Zacharakis said. ''They don't get discouraged. These guys didn't say, 'We need to raise $20 million.' They built their machine for $60,000. And when it didn't pan out, they listened to what customers said and adapted it to the market.''
 With all the twists and turns of fate that small-business owners confront, might Scale Computing fail? ''If it does, we'll say, 'All right. Let's do something else,' '' he said. ''The point is to have fun, and we're having a blast.''

HEADLINE: Health Care Reform and 'American Values'

BYLINE: By PAULINE W. CHEN, M.D.

 BODY:
I was born, raised and live in the United States, but recently a neighbor asked me, ''What are you?'' 
 As the daughter of Taiwanese immigrants, I have gone through this line of inquiry my entire life, so I understood that while well-intentioned, my neighbor's question carried the assumption that I was not, at least in his eyes, entirely American. 
 On that day, however, I decided not to elaborate on my family's immigration history. Instead, I threw the question back to him, hoping in part that he would tell me about the countries from which his family originated. 
 ''Well,'' I said, ''tell me first, what are you?'' 
 ''I'm an American!'' he replied without a moment's thought. But then he asked once again, ''So what are you?''
 According to a recent editorial in The New England Journal of Medicine, my neighbor is not the only one who holds erroneous assumptions about the meaning of ''American.'' Dr. Allan S. Brett, a professor of medicine and bioethicist at the University of South Carolina, argues that politicians and pundits from both sides of the aisle are now doing the same, using incorrect beliefs about ''American values'' as a smokescreen in the health care reform debate. Phrases like ''uniquely American'' have become high praise, while ''Canadian'' and ''British'' are fighting words or frank defamation.
 As Dr. Brett writes, ''[T]he underlying premise is that an identifiable set of American values point incontrovertibly to a health care system anchored by the private insurance industry. . . .Discussions dominated by references to uniquely American individualism, uniquely American solutions, or narrowly defined conceptions of choice tell us more about the political and economic interest of the discussants than about the interest of the Americans they claim to represent.''
 I spoke to Dr. Brett recently and asked him about the notion of ''American values,'' the assumptions made in the health care debate, and what system, if any, might come close to representing what is American. 
 Q. What assumptions do public figures have when they use the term ''American values''?
 A. They assume several things. First, that you can take just about any American walking down the street and reliably make an inference about what their views will be and what they deem important in health care. But anyone with his or her eyes open knows just how heterogeneous we've become in this country. 
 They also assume that these ''American values'' can be predictably translated into organizational structures. But that's not true. One cannot assume, for instance, that if a person prizes liberty and freedom, he or she will prefer private insurance. Instead, maybe what that person wants is freedom from worries about what will happen should he or she suddenly became ill. Maybe that person wants the liberty to accomplish what he or she wants to accomplish. Those goals are better served by a seamless health care system where the individual doesn't have to worry about what is coming from around the corner.
 The concept of American values is used to tell people what they should be wanting rather than objectively trying to understand what Americans are all about. 
 Q. What about freedom of choice in health care? Isn't that uniquely American?
 A. There are three types of choice in health care. 
 The first is the choice of your preferred physician. In the most popular health plans, the choices are virtually unlimited; people can chose whom they want to see and where they want to go. But a single-payer system, for example, does not necessarily change that, since all the facilities and practices as we know them today are left in place. In fact, if you take away all the insurance restrictions we have today on whom you can see, your choice is increased.
 A second type of choice is the freedom to choose a health care plan. We do want to choose our hospitals and doctors. But do we really look forward every November to choosing between one of five plans with permutations and combinations of physicians, providers in network and providers out of network? What people really want is a user-friendly system to get what they need.
 Finally, the third kind of choice has to do with deciding on whatever tests and treatments you might want as a patient. But that element of choice has to be carefully handled no matter what kind of system we have because those choices affect cost. Over the last 10 to 20 years, the pendulum has swung toward patient autonomy -- which is a good thing -- but it has also swung to the point where doctors sometimes feel they must give patients whatever they want without thinking critically about the risks and benefits. That has led to a huge proportion of money being spent on care that is not only marginally beneficial but is also of no benefit at all. I think that if we had a way to eliminate that -- which means using our clinical decision-making skills and saying no when appropriate -- we would have more money to spend on care that does matter and that makes a difference. 
 No matter what system we ultimately decide upon, there will have to be mechanisms in place to insure that we spend money wisely.
 Q. So is there anything that is uniquely ''American'' about our way of approaching health care? 
 A. Yes. We are unique almost worldwide in that we deny health care coverage to a proportion of our population. 
 I do not believe there are pivotally important distinctions between our ''American values'' and those of other Western European and North American countries, and certainly not the kind of distinctions that would prevent us from sorting out our health care system. I don't think we are as unique as politicians make us out to be. Even if we were that unique, the important thing is to get health care right and not to harp on the uniqueness of the system we come up with. 
 Q. How would you envision a health care system that is imbued with ''American values''?
 A. In virtually every opinion poll conducted in recent years, a majority of Americans favor government guaranteed health insurance. While a single-payer system isn't the only way for the government to guarantee coverage for all, I think one way to think of such a system is to consider it ''Medicare for all.'' 
 But such a system would have to be accompanied by a really hard look, led by medical experts and members of the community, at what works and what doesn't, an assessment of how we can best budget our health care dollars to achieve the best possible health care outcomes. Such a system would take time and there would be hard choices, and not everyone would be happy. But we might come closer than we are to representing the interests of most Americans.

HEADLINE: U.S. Stance Toward Russia Again Divides Europe

BYLINE: By JUDY DEMPSEY

DATELINE: BERLIN 

 BODY:
Twenty years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, new fissures are emerging between Western and Eastern Europe -- this time over President Obama's policy toward Russia, according to an international survey published Wednesday.
 The survey, Transatlantic Trends, an annual poll of European and American public opinion conducted for the German Marshall Fund of the United States, found that Europeans, far from speaking with one voice on foreign policy issues, are divided over the role of the United States and how to respond to the growing assertiveness of Russia.
 The report also revealed big differences among the East Europeans themselves over their attitudes on the United States and Russia. 
 During the closing years of the Bush administration, the trans-Atlantic relationship, including European support for the United States-led NATO military alliance, had reached a low in opinion polls. After Mr. Obama's first half year in office, he has ''nearly reversed the collapse in public support for the United States,'' the report says. 
 About 77 percent of respondents in the European Union and Turkey supported Mr. Obama's handling of international affairs -- a quadrupling of support compared with opinions of the Bush administration.
 But in Eastern Europe, more than 60 percent of respondents said they were skeptical about Mr. Obama's foreign policy, especially regarding Russia, Iran, Afghanistan and the Middle East. And just over half of the respondents in that part of Europe said they saw the United States in a positive light, compared with 63 percent of West Europeans.
 The difference among individual European Union countries is even greater. In France, President Obama's popularity is 77 percentage points higher than President George W. Bush's rating. Yet in Romania and Poland, Mr. Obama's popularity over Mr. Bush is just 14 percentage points and 11 percentage points, respectively. Even more striking, only 25 percent of Central and East Europeans said they believed that relations between the United States and Europe had improved under Mr. Obama, compared with 43 percent of West Europeans.
 The survey says the disparity between Eastern and Western Europe could be attributed to the fact that the Bush administration embraced Eastern Europe by encouraging NATO's enlargement in 2004 and that it took a more aggressive stance toward Russia.
 The Bush administration also proposed placing the Pentagon's antiballistic missile shield in Poland and the Czech Republic, a move that was strongly opposed by Russia and several West European nations. It was staunchly supported by most East European countries because they saw the shield as a defense against Russia, not missiles from Iran.
 The Europeans are still divided over how to deal with Russia, particularly regarding the issue of whether to further enlarge NATO -- which Russia opposes -- and the European Union's growing dependence on Russia for its energy.
 Yet the survey found that even those divisions are complicated. ''The popular image of a Russia-phobic Central and Eastern Europe and a more Russia-friendly Western Europe was not found in Transatlantic Trends 2009 data,'' the report says.
 On economic issues, the report says that 43 percent of Americans supported closer economic ties with the European Union, compared with 37 percent of the population in the European bloc.
 Majorities all over Europe are worried about Russia as an energy provider. But when respondents were asked if they would abandon certain Western alliance policies, like NATO enlargement, to secure energy supplies from Russia, only 28 percent of East Europeans said they would consider that, compared with 41 percent of West Europeans.
 The Transatlantic Trends survey included random samples of approximately 1,000 adults in the United States and 12 European countries -- Portugal, Spain, Germany, Britain, France, Turkey, the Netherlands, Romania, Italy, Poland, Bulgaria and Slovakia -- from June 9 to July 1. It had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points in each of the 13 countries surveyed.

HEADLINE: Big Food Vs. Big Insurance

BYLINE: By MICHAEL POLLAN. 
Michael Pollan, a contributing writer for The Times Magazine and a professor of journalism at the University of California, Berkeley, is the author of ''In Defense of Food: An Eater's Manifesto.''

DATELINE: Berkeley, Calif. 

 BODY:
 TO listen to President Obama's speech on Wednesday night, or to just about anyone else in the health care debate, you would think that the biggest problem with health care in America is the system itself -- perverse incentives, inefficiencies, unnecessary tests and procedures, lack of competition, and greed. 
 No one disputes that the $2.3 trillion we devote to the health care industry is often spent unwisely, but the fact that the United States spends twice as much per person as most European countries on health care can be substantially explained, as a study released last month says, by our being fatter. Even the most efficient health care system that the administration could hope to devise would still confront a rising tide of chronic disease linked to diet.
 That's why our success in bringing health care costs under control ultimately depends on whether Washington can summon the political will to take on and reform a second, even more powerful industry: the food industry. 
 According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, three-quarters of health care spending now goes to treat ''preventable chronic diseases.'' Not all of these diseases are linked to diet -- there's smoking, for instance -- but many, if not most, of them are. 
 We're spending $147 billion to treat obesity, $116 billion to treat diabetes, and hundreds of billions more to treat cardiovascular disease and the many types of cancer that have been linked to the so-called Western diet. One recent study estimated that 30 percent of the increase in health care spending over the past 20 years could be attributed to the soaring rate of obesity, a condition that now accounts for nearly a tenth of all spending on health care. 
 The American way of eating has become the elephant in the room in the debate over health care. The president has made a few notable allusions to it, and, by planting her vegetable garden on the South Lawn, Michelle Obama has tried to focus our attention on it. Just last month, Mr. Obama talked about putting a farmers' market in front of the White House, and building new distribution networks to connect local farmers to public schools so that student lunches might offer more fresh produce and fewer Tater Tots. He's even floated the idea of taxing soda. 
 But so far, food system reform has not figured in the national conversation about health care reform. And so the government is poised to go on encouraging America's fast-food diet with its farm policies even as it takes on added responsibilities for covering the medical costs of that diet. To put it more bluntly, the government is putting itself in the uncomfortable position of subsidizing both the costs of treating Type 2 diabetes and the consumption of high-fructose corn syrup. 
 Why the disconnect? Probably because reforming the food system is politically even more difficult than reforming the health care system. At least in the health care battle, the administration can count some powerful corporate interests on its side -- like the large segment of the Fortune 500 that has concluded the current system is unsustainable. 
 That is hardly the case when it comes to challenging agribusiness. Cheap food is going to be popular as long as the social and environmental costs of that food are charged to the future. There's lots of money to be made selling fast food and then treating the diseases that fast food causes. One of the leading products of the American food industry has become patients for the American health care industry.
 The market for prescription drugs and medical devices to manage Type 2 diabetes, which the Centers for Disease Control estimates will afflict one in three Americans born after 2000, is one of the brighter spots in the American economy. As things stand, the health care industry finds it more profitable to treat chronic diseases than to prevent them. There's more money in amputating the limbs of diabetics than in counseling them on diet and exercise.
 As for the insurers, you would think preventing chronic diseases would be good business, but, at least under the current rules, it's much better business simply to keep patients at risk for chronic disease out of your pool of customers, whether through lifetime caps on coverage or rules against pre-existing conditions or by figuring out ways to toss patients overboard when they become ill. 
 But these rules may well be about to change -- and, when it comes to reforming the American diet and food system, that step alone could be a game changer. Even under the weaker versions of health care reform now on offer, health insurers would be required to take everyone at the same rates, provide a standard level of coverage and keep people on their rolls regardless of their health. Terms like ''pre-existing conditions'' and ''underwriting'' would vanish from the health insurance rulebook -- and, when they do, the relationship between the health insurance industry and the food industry will undergo a sea change. 
 The moment these new rules take effect, health insurance companies will promptly discover they have a powerful interest in reducing rates of obesity and chronic diseases linked to diet. A patient with Type 2 diabetes incurs additional health care costs of more than $6,600 a year; over a lifetime, that can come to more than $400,000. Insurers will quickly figure out that every case of Type 2 diabetes they can prevent adds $400,000 to their bottom line. Suddenly, every can of soda or Happy Meal or chicken nugget on a school lunch menu will look like a threat to future profits. 
 When health insurers can no longer evade much of the cost of treating the collateral damage of the American diet, the movement to reform the food system -- everything from farm policy to food marketing and school lunches -- will acquire a powerful and wealthy ally, something it hasn't really ever had before.
 AGRIBUSINESS dominates the agriculture committees of Congress, and has swatted away most efforts at reform. But what happens when the health insurance industry realizes that our system of farm subsidies makes junk food cheap, and fresh produce dear, and thus contributes to obesity and Type 2 diabetes? It will promptly get involved in the fight over the farm bill -- which is to say, the industry will begin buying seats on those agriculture committees and demanding that the next bill be written with the interests of the public health more firmly in mind. 
 In the same way much of the health insurance industry threw its weight behind the campaign against smoking, we can expect it to support, and perhaps even help pay for, public education efforts like New York City's bold new ad campaign against drinking soda. At the moment, a federal campaign to discourage the consumption of sweetened soft drinks is a political nonstarter, but few things could do more to slow the rise of Type 2 diabetes among adolescents than to reduce their soda consumption, which represents 15 percent of their caloric intake. 
 That's why it's easy to imagine the industry throwing its weight behind a soda tax. School lunch reform would become its cause, too, and in time the industry would come to see that the development of regional food systems, which make fresh produce more available and reduce dependence on heavily processed food from far away, could help prevent chronic disease and reduce their costs. 
 Recently a team of designersfrom M.I.T. and Columbia was asked by the foundation of the insurer UnitedHealthcare to develop an innovative systems approach to tackling childhood obesity in America. Their conclusion surprised the designers as much as their sponsor: they determined that promoting the concept of a ''foodshed'' -- a diversified, regional food economy -- could be the key to improving the American diet.
 All of which suggests that passing a health care reform bill, no matter how ambitious, is only the first step in solving our health care crisis. To keep from bankrupting ourselves, we will then have to get to work on improving our health -- which means going to work on the American way of eating. 
 But even if we get a health care bill that does little more than require insurers to cover everyone on the same basis, it could put us on that course. 
 For it will force the industry, and the government, to take a good hard look at the elephant in the room and galvanize a movement to slim it down.

HEADLINE: Making the Case for Leadership, Not Just Health Care Legislation

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
On one level, President Obama's address to a joint session of Congress on Wednesday night was what it seemed: an attempt to corral lawmakers into approving the signature initiative of his presidency, the health care overhaul that has eluded Washington, as Mr. Obama said, for 65 years.
 But the speech was about more than health care. 
 It was an attempt by this still new president to display his authority to a Congress that had begun to question his fortitude, to show that he was as strong a political leader as he was a political candidate and to show that he was not -- to use the shorthand of the day -- another Jimmy Carter: professorial, aloof, a micromanager who perhaps was not ready to be the nation's chief executive. 
 It is one thing to create and surf a political movement, as Mr. Obama did in capturing the White House. It is quite another to lead an uneasy country and a politically divided Congress toward tough decisions that create winners and losers. 
 ''That's what this is about,'' said Joe Trippi, a Democratic consultant. ''We know he can be a candidate; he may even have the right ideas. Now he has to reach down there and make something big happen in the country -- either a lot of Americans changing their minds, or members of Congress backing his agenda even if it puts their own political hides at risk. Can he get people to do these things?''
 For nearly an hour, Mr. Obama spoke strongly and passionately, pausing only to acknowledge the repeated cheers from his audience as he made what appeared to be his clearest and most concise case yet on a complicated issue that had repeatedly defied his communications skills.
 He managed to invest his case with both economic and emotional urgency -- particularly when he invoked the memory of Senator Edward M. Kennedy, whose widow, Victoria, was in the audience -- without getting bogged down in too many details. 
 Mr. Obama had clearly decided to speak more to the American people watching on television than to the lawmakers arrayed in front of him in the House chamber. On this evening, at least, Congress was part of the political theater, both in the form of the constant applause from fellow Democrats and in the person of the Republican congressman who yelled out ''lie'' when Mr. Obama asserted that nothing in his plan would provide coverage for illegal immigrants.
 It will take time to see if this works. Bill Clinton gave a similarly well-received address on this very subject in the chamber 16 years ago, to an audience that included many of the same people, among them his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, then an author of an ambitious health care plan, now secretary of state. 
 But there was a key difference between Mr. Clinton in 1993 and Mr. Obama today. For Mr. Clinton, it was the beginning of the process; Mr. Obama was ushering in what he hopes to be an endgame, at a moment, as he noted, when four Congressional committees have already reported out bills.
 In a recognition of the current political atmosphere, Mr. Obama used his speech to ease away from what had been another defining aspect of his candidacy: the promise to transcend the partisanship in Washington.
 He did offer gestures across the aisle, embracing an idea from Senator John McCain of Arizona that would insure the poor against catastrophic medical expenses and endorsing some sort of medical malpractice limits that Republicans have long championed.
 But in a climate where at this point he might be lucky to get more than one or two Republican votes from Congress, those were seen by Republicans and Democrats alike mostly as an effort by the White House to get credit for trying and so insulate the administration from criticism that it was trying to jam a bill through on its terms. For the White House, one of the more worrisome events of this summer has been an erosion of independent voters' support for this president and his health care plan.
 Though Mr. Obama spoke of a plan that ''incorporates ideas from many people in this room tonight, Democrats and Republicans,'' he used the kind of tough, confrontational language that suggested the extent to which the White House would seek to portray Republicans as recalcitrant and standing in the face of a historical tide. 
 ''Know this,'' he said: ''I will not waste time with those who have made the calculation that it's better politics to kill this plan than improve it.''
 Matthew Dowd, a onetime adviser to former President George W. Bush, argued in an interview that Mr. Obama would not succeed unless he trimmed back on his plan, defying liberal Democrats and appealing to Republicans.
 ''You cannot sell the country on something it doesn't want,'' Mr. Dowd said.
 Mr. Obama is most engaged when his back is to the wall, typically after a period of drift. Again and again throughout his career, he has risen to the occasion: The November 2007 speech at a dinner of Democrats in Iowa that put him on the road to victory there, his speech that defused the controversy over racially charged remarks by his onetime pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr., even the speech he gave to Democrats at the 2004 convention in Boston that elevated him to fame.
 But as he struggles with the adjustment from campaigning to governing, the battle he is trying to bring to a successful close may prove the toughest test of all.
 For his first six months in Washington, Mr. Obama was carried by the momentum of the excitement of his election, by the adrenaline of dealing with the financial crisis that greeted him and by his own popularity. Now, with polls suggesting that all that is beginning to fade, and with Republicans regrouping, he is faced with a need to show that the leadership strengths he displayed as a candidate can be transferred to the office of the presidency.

 CORRECTION:
A picture in some editions on Thursday with a news analysis article about President Obama's speech to Congress carried an erroneous caption and credit. The photograph of a man being interviewed was of David Axelrod, a senior adviser to the president and was taken by Amanda Lucidon for The New York Times, not by Michael F. McElroy. The picture was not of Elaine Carl, a Florida resident who watched the speech. (A picture of Ms. Carl watching television appeared with the article in earlier editions.)

HEADLINE: 100 Jobs? It Looks Good To Michigan

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY and BILL VLASIC

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
The announcement of a new plant employing just 100 workers might seem like a long shot to attract the chief executive of General Motors, two senators and a raft of state and local officeholders from across Michigan.
 But in a state that has lost 800,000 jobs this decade, 18 percent of its work force, the Aug. 13 official opening of a G.M. factory to build electric-car batteries in Brownstown, about 20 miles southwest of Detroit, was a can't-miss event.
 ''The phrase 'new plant' isn't one we're used to hearing these days,'' said John Cherry, Michigan's lieutenant governor, as he stood inside the sprawling, empty building in this industrial town about 20 miles south of Detroit. 
 Any new factory would be celebrated in this state, which has been hit harder than most by the recession. 
 But the one in Brownstown held particular significance because it was another small step in Michigan's efforts to revive its economy with ''green'' manufacturing.
 The state has moved aggressively to offset the drain of traditional auto manufacturing jobs by promoting Michigan as the place to invest in alternative energy projects.
 By the end of July, for example, Michigan had already exhausted its full year's budget of $725 million in tax credits to attract new companies to the state.
 Gov. Jennifer M. Granholm has been asking state legislators to allocate more tax credits, specifically to help redevelop an old Ford Motor Company plant in the town of Wixom into a $1 billion green manufacturing center. The legislature is expected to approve an additional $100 million in credits as soon as this week.
 Three companies, Clairvoyant Energy from California, Xtreme Power from Texas and Oerlikon Solar from Switzerland have committed to moving into the vacant Wixom plant if tax credits are available. Executives from the companies plan to join Ms. Granholm and Ford's executive chairman, William Clay Ford Jr., at the plant Thursday to celebrate the redevelopment project, which the state sees as a centerpiece of its green-oriented revival effort.
 The chief executive of Clairvoyant Energy, David Hardee, said Michigan was an ideal location for his solar-energy company because of the availability of so many skilled workers and its manufacturing background.
 Mr. Hardee said he also had been impressed by the state's determination to reinvent itself as an incubator of alternative-energy companies.
 ''Maybe I'm just rooting for the underdog,'' Mr. Hardee said of Michigan. ''This is exactly what renewable energy is all about.''
 The Wixom project is expected to create about 4,000 jobs, which would be one of the biggest green-energy developments in the state so far.
 There have been other successes. A solar-panel manufacturer has resurrected a closed refrigerator plant in the small city of Greenville in western Michigan. Earlier this summer, General Electric said it would build a research center near Detroit, employing 1,100 workers on wind-turbine technology.
 Since 2005, the number of green jobs in Michigan has grown by 8 percent, while construction jobs have declined 20 percent and manufacturing jobs have fallen 14 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
 Still, the 35,000 green jobs represent less than 1 percent of the state's overall 3.9 million jobs. And with more auto plants slated to close because of the reorganizations of G.M. and Chrysler, Michigan is pushing hard to do whatever it can to replace them.
 Ms.. Granholm, with the assistance of the state's Congressional delegation, has made green manufacturing a top priority in Michigan, where the unemployment rate hit 15 percent, the highest in the nation, last month.
 ''Michigan intends to lead the nation in this green industrial revolution,'' Ms. Granholm said at an automotive conference in Traverse City, Mich., last month. ''We are not going to dig our heels in. We are going to lead.''
 The state's job losses for this decade are expected to reach 1 million by the end of 2010. Large alternative-energy projects have the potential to offset some of the decline, said Greg Main, president of the Michigan Economic Development Corporation.
 ''It's not big numbers at this point,'' Mr. Main said. ''It pales in comparison to a million jobs lost, but I think we're on our way.''
 The Obama administration is supporting Michigan's efforts. Last month, the president announced $2.4 billion in financing for advanced battery and electric-vehicle projects across the country, with more than half of the money going to companies in Michigan.
 State officials project that battery projects will create almost 7,000 jobs in the next 18 months, and 40,000 by the year 2020.
 The plant in Brownstown, while small, is G.M.'s first venture into assembling batteries for its own vehicles. With most battery production now concentrated in Asia, the G.M. facility is considered a step toward building a manufacturing base in the United States.
 News of plant openings is at least giving the residents of some beaten-down cities something to talk about. 
 The city of Greenville, near Grand Rapids, lost 3,000 jobs in 2006 when the appliance maker Electrolux closed its century-old refrigerator plant and moved production to Mexico.
 About 400 workers now build solar panels in the factory complex for United Solar Ovonic. Even though it's a much smaller work force, the operation has prompted the city to adopt a new nickname: ''Greenerville.''
 The plant, said State Representative Mike Huckleberry, has given the city a new, albeit fragile, feeling of hope.
 ''We need manufacturing jobs,'' said Mr. Huckleberry. ''We have people going to bed hungry in my town. People are hungry. They need jobs.''

HEADLINE: In Mayoral Debate, Heated Words (and Some Gaffes)

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO; David W. Chen contributed reporting.

 BODY:
It was a perfunctory, even predictable debate question: What would be your first act as mayor? 
 But with the cameras rolling on Wednesday night, William C. Thompson Jr., New York City's comptroller, seemed flummoxed, pausing for a painful six seconds, fumbling through a couple of false starts, then settling on a boilerplate answer: fire all of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's commissioners. 
 It was an unexpected miscue in the second and final debate between Mr. Thompson and Councilman Tony Avella of Queens, the two officials who are competing in the Democratic primary on Tuesday for the right to take on Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg in November. 
 During the debate, the candidates clashed over public schools, campaign fund-raising and the city's rent guidelines board, with Mr. Avella repeatedly putting Mr. Thompson on the defensive. 
 At one point, he suggested that Mr. Thompson, a former president of the city's defunct Board of Education, was a flawed candidate with a weak track record who would prove an easy target for Mr. Bloomberg in attack advertisements. ''He is just waiting for commercial after commercial,'' Mr. Avella said of the mayor. 
 Mr. Thompson, who is heavily favored in the primary, refrained from attacking his opponent in the debate, saving all of his fire for Mr. Bloomberg, whom he portrayed as an out-of-touch business mogul who was too cozy with developers. He called the new Yankee Stadium ''another Mike Bloomberg giveaway boondoggle'' and said that the city's schools had become testing factories rather than centers of learning. 
 In their first meeting, neither candidate committed any gaffes. In the second, they were not as fortunate. 
 Asked about the long-awaited Second Avenue subway, a popular congestion-relief project on the East Side of Manhattan, Mr. Avella suggested immediately halting construction of the new line and building an above-ground light-rail system. 
 The debate's moderator, Bill Ritter of WABC-TV, reminded him that billions in taxpayer dollars had already been invested in the project, with deep holes dug and residents displaced.
 ''Just pave it over?'' he asked. 
 ''No, we could use it to wherever the train goes -- you could stop and do the light-rail system.''
 ''On top of it? Mr. Ritter asked.
 ''Yes,'' Mr. Avella said.
 Mr. Thompson objected. ''We need to improve the mass transit for people who use it,'' he said. ''Second Avenue is one way.'' But Mr. Thompson soon provided a peculiar answer of his own. When asked what steps he had taken to improve the environment, Mr. Thompson paused, then said that he was now chauffeured around the city in a hybrid sport utility vehicle.
 Mr. Avella, who during the debate vowed to drive himself as mayor -- if security permitted it -- responded that he had proposed legislation barring city residents from paving over their front lawns. 
 The first 10 minutes of the debate focused on Mr. Thompson's handling of the city's $80 billion pension system, which he oversees as comptroller.
 Asked about an article in The New York Times that showed he had taken hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign donations from investment managers who do business with the city, even as the city's pension funds lagged behind their peers, Mr. Thompson said there was ''no pay to play in my office.'' And he said that by many measures, the city's pension funds had performed well, especially in the last year, as the stock market stumbled. 
 Mr. Thompson has raised far more money in the campaign than Mr. Avella, who says his smaller war chest leaves him less beholden to special interests. 
 Both candidates offered detailed proposals for improving the economy without burdening city residents with hefty new taxes. Mr. Thompson suggested creating a more generous film tax credit to make New York City ''the film capital of the world,'' and using zoning laws to protect small businesses from losing their leases to chain stores. 
 Mr. Avella suggested a system of rent control for small businesses to hold down costs, and the revival of the commuter tax. 
 Asked to share something about themselves that would surprise voters, Mr. Avella described how he had given up his city-issued parking placard, which he considers a corrupting perk, even though it forced him to spend hours looking for a parking spot. 
 Mr. Thompson said that he had struggled with weight. ''I haven't done a great job with it,'' he said. ''Keeping the pounds off is difficult.''

HEADLINE: President Obama Steps Forward

 BODY:
For a man who made health care reform his top domestic priority, President Obama stood on the sidelines throughout a long difficult spring and politically overheated summer. He left it primarily to Congress to flesh out the details of reform and waited in vain for a bipartisan compromise to emerge -- a virtual impossibility from the start given the determination of top Republicans to kill his effort and cripple his administration. 
 On Wednesday night, reeling from the angry if ill-informed outbursts at town hall meetings and concerned about his slipping poll numbers, the president finally found his voice. His speech to a joint session of Congress was rhetorically powerful in its insistence that reform must finally happen -- for the sake of Americans' health and the economic health of the country. We hope it was only the start of a sustained campaign to get this essential legislation passed. 
 Mr. Obama did well to reveal his requirements for meaningful reform. He stood by the importance of requiring everyone to carry insurance and requiring businesses to provide it or pay to help cover their workers' costs. That is critical to ensuring a big enough pool of healthy and unhealthy people to spread risks fairly. 
 Mr. Obama said the plan he is proposing would cost about $900 billion over 10 years, mostly to expand Medicaid coverage of the poor and provide subsidies for low- and middle-income Americans to buy policies on new health insurance exchanges. 
 Mr. Obama fell short when he failed to say how generous the subsidies should be and who should be eligible to receive them. His $900 billion may not be enough to cover nearly all of the uninsured. Congress should increase it.
 Equally important, Mr. Obama pledged that his plan would not add to the nation's enormous deficit now or in the future. He said any legislation must include a provision that requires additional spending cuts if reforms don't provide the expected savings. 
 Mr. Obama was absolutely right when he said that the relentless rise in the cost of Medicare and Medicaid will cripple the nation's economy. But Americans need to hear a lot more from him and from Congress about how they will address that problem. Anyone opposed to reform has to answer that same question. 
 Mr. Obama made a strong case for creating a new public plan to compete with private plans on the exchanges. 
 He is right that all Americans will benefit if the insurance companies have more competition, but he stopped short of declaring a public plan a necessity. It may not be, but it is too soon to abandon the idea. He should trade it away only in return for significant political support -- and should demand a trigger to resurrect it should private plans fail to provide affordable policies.
 The president was right to stress that reform is essential not just for the uninsured but for all Americans -- far too many of us are just a layoff or a job switch or a divorce or an illness away from losing coverage. He said his plan would make it unlawful for insurance companies to deny coverage or refuse to renew it based on health status, and would limit how much people can be charged for out-of-pocket expenses such as co-payments. 
 We believe that Mr. Obama has been far too passive -- for the sake of an unrequited bipartisanship -- as his opponents have twisted and distorted the health care debate. It was encouraging to hear him reject those distortions -- specifically the absurd charge that he was opening the door to ''death panels'' -- as lies. 
 And he finally laid down a warning: ''I will not waste time with those who have made the calculation that it's better politics to kill this plan than improve it.'' He should stick to that commitment. 
 Having let his opponents frame the debate for far too long, Mr. Obama will need to do more than orate. He needs to twist arms among timid Democrats in Congress to get a strong bill passed, most likely with little support from Republicans.

HEADLINE: Plan Builds on Others' Ideas, Like Fees and Medicare 'Trigger'

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR and JACKIE CALMES

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
''This is the plan I'm proposing,'' President Obama finally said Wednesday night, months into the bruising health care debate that he initiated without ever formally laying down a measure of his own.
 But in a prime-time address to a joint session of Congress, Mr. Obama added just a few new twists to the broad principles he laid out last winter, in each case borrowing from the ideas of others, including his former Republican presidential rival, in a bid to build support for passage this fall.
 The president put a $900 billion, 10-year cost limit on a package that officials formerly described as likely to exceed $1 trillion. 
 The number suggests a political and fiscal calculation to avoid the sticker shock of the trillion-dollar threshold. But it probably means that Mr. Obama could fall short of his goal of providing universal coverage for all Americans because the lower cost may force lawmakers to reduce the subsidies needed to help more uninsured individuals and small businesses seeking coverage for employees.
 To help raise revenues to offset the cost of overhauling health care, Mr. Obama took a stand on an issue about which he has equivocated for months. He endorsed the idea of imposing a fee, or tax, on health insurance companies for ''their most expensive policies.'' Proponents say the idea, which originated with Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, would encourage employers to buy cheaper, less generous coverage for employees, thereby reducing excessive use of medical services. 
 But many House Democrats, labor unions and insurers have resisted those proposals, saying the tax would often be passed on to employers and to workers in the form of higher premiums.
 That suggested a problem for Mr. Obama in endorsing the fee: If it was drafted in a way that meant new costs for union workers with generous insurance policies, that could be seen as violating a campaign promise not to raise taxes on anyone making less than $250,000 a year. 
 In his speech on Wednesday, the president tried to make clear that the bar would be set high enough not to break his anti-tax pledge.
 Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, proposed such a tax this week as part of his long-awaited legislative draft. 
 Mr. Baucus would impose an excise tax of 35 percent on insurance companies for policies costing more than $8,000 for an individual and $21,000 for a family. The tax would apply to the amount of premiums above the threshold. 
 Mr. Obama, in his address, also endorsed a budget mechanism to automatically reduce the growth of Medicare spending if health care overhaul does not produce the savings that the administration and many health care experts expect. A senior administration official called it ''a deficit trigger.''
 The idea borrows from a paper in June by David M. Cutler, a Harvard University economist, and Judith Feder, a health policy scholar at the Center for American Progress, a liberal-leaning research institute from which Mr. Obama has drawn many policy ideas and hired advisers.
 Mr. Obama was still somewhat ambiguous on one of the most contentious issues in the national debate: whether Congress must establish a new government insurance program to compete with private insurers around the country.
 Mr. Obama suggested that the importance of the public option had been exaggerated. While he would like to create such an option, he said, ''it is only one part of my plan,'' a means to the end of affordable coverage for all.
 The administration has sent mixed signals on the proposal for a public option in the past, and the president said again Wednesday that he was open to alternatives, including nonprofit insurance cooperatives and a backup plan that could be offered by the government in certain circumstances.
 ''Some have suggested that the public option go into effect only in those markets where insurance companies are not providing affordable policies,'' Mr. Obama said, referring to a proposal by Senator Olympia J. Snowe, Republican of Maine. ''Others propose a co-op or another nonprofit entity to administer the plan. These are all constructive ideas worth exploring.''
 As an interim step, Mr. Obama called for establishing a high-risk pool that could immediately offer coverage to those who cannot afford health insurance.
 ''For those Americans who can't get insurance today because they have pre-existing medical conditions,'' he said, ''we will immediately offer low-cost coverage that will protect you against financial ruin if you become seriously ill.''
 Hours before his speech, in an interview with the ABC News program ''Good Morning America,'' Mr. Obama acknowledged that he probably was wrong not to be more clear from the beginning. 
 ''I, out of an effort to give Congress the ability to do their thing and not step on their toes, probably left too much ambiguity out there, which allowed the opponents of reform to come in and to fill up the airwaves with a lot of nonsense,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Obama, Armed With Details, Challenges Congress

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG and JEFF ZELENY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama confronted a critical Congress and a skeptical nation on Wednesday, decrying the ''scare tactics'' of his opponents and presenting his most forceful case yet for a sweeping health care overhaul that has eluded Washington for generations.
 In blunt language before a rare joint session of Congress, Mr. Obama vowed that he would ''not waste time'' with those who have made a political calculation to oppose him, but left the door open to working with Republicans to cut health costs and expand coverage to millions of Americans.
 ''The time for bickering is over,'' the president declared. ''The time for games has passed. Now is the season for action.'' 
 The president was greeted by booming applause from Democrats and polite handshakes from Republicans. But the political challenge at hand soon became clear as several Republican lawmakers heckled Mr. Obama when he dismissed the notion that so-called death panels would deny care to the elderly. 
 ''It is a lie, plain and simple,'' Mr. Obama declared.
 ''You lie!'' Representative Joe Wilson of South Carolina yelled back after Mr. Obama said it was not true that the Democrats were proposing to provide health coverage to illegal immigrants.
 The 47-minute speech was an effort by Mr. Obama to regain his political footing on health care, his highest legislative priority. He insisted throughout that he had not closed the door on reaching a bipartisan compromise. He gave a nod to Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and embraced his proposal to create a high-risk pool to help cover people with pre-existing conditions against catastrophic expenses.
 And, with the widow of Senator Edward M. Kennedy sitting in the House gallery, the president appealed to the nation's conscience, reading a letter Mr. Kennedy had written in May with instructions that it be delivered to the president upon his death. In it, Mr. Kennedy wrote that health care was ''above all a moral issue; at stake are not just the details of policy, but fundamental principles of social justice and the character of our country.''
 Presidents since Theodore Roosevelt have been advocating universal health care without success, and Mr. Obama vowed to fare better. ''I am not the first president to take up this cause,'' he said, ''but I am determined to be the last.''
 The speech came after a rocky August for the White House, in which many lawmakers held public meetings that deteriorated into shouting matches over health care. 
 After months of insisting he would leave the specifics to lawmakers, Mr. Obama used the speech to present his most detailed outline yet of a plan he said would provide ''security and stability'' to those who have insurance and cover those who do not, all without adding to the federal deficit.
 The president placed a price tag on the plan of about $900 billion over 10 years, which he said was ''less than we have spent on the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.'' But he devoted much of his address to making the case for why such a plan is necessary, and sought to reassure the elderly and the Americans who already have insurance that they would not be worse off.
 As expected, Mr. Obama repeated his support for a government insurance plan to compete with the private sector, though he said he would consider alternatives to the ''public option.'' 
 He sketched out a vision for a plan in which it would be illegal for insurers to drop sick people or deny them coverage for pre-existing conditions, and in which every American would be required to carry health coverage, just as drivers must carry auto insurance.
 Mr. Obama did embrace some fresh proposals. He announced a new initiative to create pilot projects intended to curb medical malpractice lawsuits, a cause important to physicians and Republicans. 
 He endorsed a plan, contained in a draft proposal being circulated by Senator Max Baucus, the Montana Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, to help pay for expanding coverage by taxing insurance companies that offer expensive, so-called gold-plated insurance plans.
 And, seeking to reassure those who worry he will run up the federal deficit, Mr. Obama promised to include a provision that ''requires us to come forward with more spending cuts'' if the savings he envisions do not materialize.
 In embracing Mr. McCain and the malpractice projects, the White House appeared to be seeking to lay the groundwork for an argument that the final bill would be bipartisan not because it garners Republican votes but because it contains Republican ideas. That is the same argument Mr. Obama used when the economic recovery package passed with just three Republican votes.
 Republicans seemed primed for a fight; many, like Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who has been deeply involved in health negotiations, released statements about the speech even before it began. Mr. Grassley called on Mr. Obama to ''start building the kind of legislation that could win the support of 70 to 80 senators,'' a goal Mr. Grassley said could not be achieved if the bill contained a new government plan. 
 In the Republican response, Representative Charles Boustany Jr. of Louisiana, a heart surgeon, agreed that the health care system needed an overhaul. But he urged the president to start anew, focusing on a ''common-sense, bipartisan plan.'' 
 An hour after the speech, Mr. Wilson, the heckler, issued an apology for his outburst.
 The speech was the president's second address before a joint session of Congress. But the political backdrop on Wednesday was far different from his appearance in the House chamber on the 36th day of his term, when an optimistic wave of momentum was at his back and his Republican rivals were dispirited and in disarray. 
 ''What we have also seen in these last months is the same partisan spectacle that only hardens the disdain many Americans have toward their own government. Instead of honest debate, we have seen scare tactics,'' Mr. Obama said. ''Some have dug into unyielding ideological camps that offer no hope of compromise. Too many have used this as an opportunity to score short-term political points, even if it robs the country of our opportunity to solve a long-term challenge.''
 He added, ''And out of this blizzard of charges and countercharges, confusion has reigned.''
 While Mr. Obama was addressing lawmakers inside the ornate House chamber, the much more important audience was outside Washington: the 180 million Americans who already have health insurance and who remain skeptical that Mr. Obama's plan will change things for the better. Inside the chamber, the president drew laughter when he said, ''there remain some significant details to be ironed out.''
 For Mr. Obama, the speech was a go-for-broke moment; there is no more dramatic venue for a president than an address to a joint session to Congress. For many Democrats, the speech evoked memories of a similar health care address by President Bill Clinton, 16 years ago this month. Mr. Clinton called for ''security, simplicity, savings, choice, quality and responsibility'' -- the same broad themes Mr. Obama evoked Wednesday night.
 The architect of the Clinton plan, of course, was Mr. Clinton's wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
 On Wednesday night, Mr. Obama's wife, Michelle, sat quietly in the House gallery, holding the hand of Victoria Reggie Kennedy, Mr. Kennedy's widow. Mrs. Clinton, now Mr. Obama's secretary of state, sat in the front row, smiling and shaking hands.

HEADLINE: Accountants Misled Us Into Crisis

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and economics in his blog at nytimes.com/norris.

 BODY:
The accountants let us down.
 That is one of the clear lessons of the financial crisis that drove the world into a deep recession. We now know the major banks were hiding dubious assets off their balance sheets and stretching rules if not breaking them. We know that their capital was woefully inadequate for the risks they were taking.
 Efforts are now being made to improve the rules, with some success. But banks have persuaded politicians on both sides of the Atlantic that the real problem came not when their financial inadequacies were obscured by bad accounting, but when they were revealed as the losses mounted.
 ''There were important aspects of our entire financial system that were operating like a Wild West show, huge unregulated opaque markets,'' said the man whose job was to write the accounting rules, Robert H. Herz, the chairman of the Financial Accounting Standards Board. 
 ''The crisis highlighted how important better transparency around that system is,'' Mr. Herz added in an interview this week. ''I would hope that would be a major lesson learned or relearned.''
 Unfortunately, some seem to have learned exactly the opposite lesson. Accounting rule makers at FASB and its international equivalent, the International Accounting Standards Board, have been lambasted for efforts to improve transparency by forcing banks to disclose what their dodgy assets are actually worth, as opposed to what the banks think they should be worth.
 Both boards have tried to resist, but have been forced by political pressure to back down on some specifics. In the case of FASB, the retreat took a few weeks after Mr. Herz was ordered to act at an extraordinary Congressional hearing. The international board was given a long weekend to retreat, with the European Commission threatening to impose its own rules if the board did not cave in. Both boards tried to reduce the damage by forcing more disclosures, but it is unclear how much good that will do. Neither was willing to defy the politicians. 
 It is unfortunate that there are significant differences between the American and international rules on how to determine fair values of financial assets. That has enabled banks on both sides of the Atlantic to demand that they get the best of both worlds. Pleas for a level playing field have resonated in Washington and Brussels.
 The banks have argued that market values can be misleading, and that their own estimates of the eventual cash flow from assets are more realistic than what they -- or others -- will now pay for those assets. The rules already allowed them to ignore so called ''distress sales'' in assessing fair value, but the banks pushed to broaden that exemption in the United States, while in Europe they got the regulators to allow them to retroactively stop calculating market value for assets they said they did not intend to sell.
 Behind the scenes, there is a battle pitting securities regulators -- who instinctively favor disclosure -- against banking regulators, who fear there are times when disclosure could make a bad situation worse. 
 The securities regulators argue that accounting should do its best to report the actual financial condition of a company. If the banking regulators want to allow banks to use different rules in calculating capital -- rules that would not require marking down assets, for example -- then they can do so without depriving investors of important information.
 But that information could scare those investors, and set off the kind of panic that brought down Lehman Brothers a year ago.
 It is the job of banking regulators to keep their institutions healthy, and that effort can only be helped by accounting that reveals problems early. But if the banks do get into trouble, some regulators would prefer to maintain the appearance of prosperity while efforts are made to fix the problems quietly. 
 It can be argued that approach worked nearly 20 years ago, when some banks were allowed to pretend they were solvent after the Latin American debt crisis, and were able to earn their way out of the problem over the ensuing decade.
 Had a different course been chosen in the early 1990s, Citibank might have vanished. Given what has happened to Citi in this crisis, it is not clear if that would have been a good or bad outcome.
 The accounting rules on financial assets were, and are, a confusing mess, with the same loan getting very different accounting based on whether or not it had been packaged as part of a security. In some cases, banks could not take loan losses as early as they should have, even if they wished to do so. As financial complexity increased, rule makers struggled to keep up, and were not always successful. 
 Efforts to fix those rules are under way. Accounting for loans is likely to be improved. But in the crucial area of fair value accounting, the American and international boards are not moving in tandem. The international board is delaying some issues as it rushes to get a rule out this year that will clarify when banks can ignore fair value. The American group is taking a more unified, and slower, approach. By not moving together, they run the risk of a race to the bottom, with investors the losers.
 Fair value is not the only important issue. Some of the biggest and worst surprises of the financial crisis came when banks suffered large losses from assets that they had not even reported they owned. ''With the benefit of hindsight, we know that standards were not complied with,'' said Mr. Herz, regarding the rules on which assets could be left off balance sheets.
 Those rules hinged largely on something called ''qualified special-purpose entities,'' or Q's for short. If a bank set up a Q so that it would operate automatically, with others owning the securities it issued, the bank could get the assets off its own balance sheet.
 As the Securities and Exchange Commission pointed out in a report to Congress, banks were able to greatly expand the scope of Q's, ''beyond the simple pass-through entities envisioned by the FASB.'' 
 The S.E.C., in that report, concluded that because so many problems were being caused by the development of structured transactions motivated by accounting considerations, ''improvement in transparency and comparability across issuers can perhaps most directly and quickly be accomplished by eliminating the use of such structured transactions.''
 FASB now is moving to get rid of Q's, a category that the international board never accepted to begin with. Off-balance sheet accounting is being cleaned up.
 But that move comes years too late. The S.E.C. report quoted above was issued in 2005, but nothing happened as a result. ''If they had gone after that at the S.E.C., it might have taken a couple of quarts of gasoline away from the fire,'' said Jack T. Ciesielski, whose newsletter, The Analyst's Accounting Observer, repeatedly warned of off-balance-sheet problems.
 The fights over bank accounting are taking place against the backdrop of the S.E.C. trying to decide whether and when to move the United States to international accounting standards, and as the two boards seek to converge on one set of accounting rules.
 Mr. Ciesielski fears convergence could lead to acceptance of the weakest standards for banks. But without convergence, the S.E.C. will have no standing to oversee application of international standards, or to act as a counterweight if European politicians try to order even weaker standards to protect their banks.

HALCYON 10TH ANNIVERSARY
 When halcyon first opened its doors as a lowercased record shop-cafe-thrift store-gallery-lounge on Smith Street a decade ago, the very idea of Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, as a stylish destination was still new. Most of the locavore restaurants, designer-driven boutiques and low-key bars were still a gleam in some well-meaning gentrifier's eye. How far we've come! All the way to ... Dumbo. That's where halcyon moved in 2004, driven away in part by its own success. 
 ''When we opened, we were sort of trailblazing, fashioning the neighborhood in our own image,'' said Shawn Schwartz, 39, a founder of the petite shop, which hosted regular parties with an array of resident and visiting D.J.'s. ''And at a certain point, the neighborhood caught up and surpassed us.'' The new location at 57 Pearl Street sells music, clothing and books, but it's not much of a hangout. Still, thanks to a thriving Web site, halcyonline.com, it has survived. 
 On Saturday halcyon celebrates its 10th anniversary with an all-day party at the Water Taxi Beach at the South Street Seaport in Lower Manhattan, with art projects for kids and D.J. sets by Danny Krivit, Adultnapper and the Original D.J. Jazzy Jay, and an after-party at an underground loft in Brooklyn. (The organizers of that party are a former halcyon employee and a resident D.J.; free shuttle service will be provided from the Seaport between midnight and 2 a.m.)
 Crate diggers, meanwhile, have an extra reason to visit Dumbo on Sunday, when the Brooklyn Flea -- another gleam in a gentrifier's eye -- hosts its annual Superstar D.J. Record Fair. Dozens of collectors will unload their albums alongside vintage clothing and accessories dealers and gourmet food carts. So for a day at least, the blocks in front of the new halcyon will have the one-stop-cool-hunting feel of the old days.
 Mr. Schwartz and his partner, Ricardo Moncada -- a photographer who used to hang out at the Smith Street shop -- say that vibe has not been forgotten. ''There's not one day that passes'' that people don't mention the old store, Mr. Schwartz said. ''People truly miss the experience.'' To that end, he and Mr. Moncada are scouting locations in Brooklyn to open another performance- and food-oriented space, with room for 300. They envision yoga classes and readings, as well as concerts and parties -- the economic climate suddenly makes all this much more feasible -- if they can correctly forecast the creep of gentrification.
 ''There's a sweet spot to be found,'' Mr. Schwartz said, ''where you stay just far enough ahead of it that you don't have to pay killer prices, but it gets there, nipping at your heels, enough that you can survive.''
 (halcyon anniversary, Saturday from noon to 2 a.m., Water Taxi Beach at the South Street Seaport, Fulton Street at South Street, Lower Manhattan; $10; $5 with R.S.V.P. to halcyonline.com/blog/10years; free before 3 p.m. Brooklyn Flea record sale and vintage bazaar, Sunday from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m., 167 Water Street, under the Manhattan Bridge archway, brownstoner.com/brooklynflea.)

HEADLINE: Attempting a Stimulus Package for Clothing Retailers

BYLINE: By ERIC WILSON; Ruth La Ferla and Guy Trebay contributed reporting.

 BODY:
New York City, for one night, seemed to forget that there was a recession. Streets were packed, stores were crowded and gobs of people were carrying shopping bags on Madison Avenue. And close to 1,000 were crammed around the second-floor escalators at the Macy's in Queens Center to gawk at the uncommon sight of Anna Wintour, Michael Kors, Diane Von Furstenberg, Kate Hudson, the cast of ''Hair'' and a pack of reporters, all corralled together in the career sportswear department.
 Ms. Wintour, the editor in chief of Vogue, was making a rare public appearance Thursday night in a store that does not carry Prada (save for the perfume). As her magazine is dependent on the health of designer businesses and luxury stores, it seemed that she would do almost anything to coax people to shop again, leading a caravan of handlers from Queens to Bergdorf Goodman and much later to Sean Combs's store on Fifth Avenue as part of a retail promotion called Fashion's Night Out. More than 800 stores held parties and kept their doors open until 11 p.m. Mr. Kors, the fashion designer, said they were ''beating the tom-toms'' for starving retailers. 
Ms. Wintour's appearance in a Queens shopping mall to kick off the event was a gesture to show that the idea of holding shopping parties during a recession was not, in her words, ''elitist.''
 ''It's bigger than our wildest dreams,'' Ms. Wintour said while waiting for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg to arrive. He was half an hour late, and it looked as if her patience was waning.
 ''We're just hoping that our global fashion stimulus package works,'' she said.
 The scene was utterly chaotic, and it was not entirely clear that many people had bought much more than a Fashion's Night Out charity T-shirt to benefit the National September 11 Memorial and Museum and the New York City AIDS Fund, so they could have it autographed by Ms. Wintour. Terry J. Lundgren, chief executive of Macy's, said the chain had sold more than half its 6,000 T-shirts, for $30 apiece, by 5 p.m. Mr. Kors was joking that Raquel Zimmermann, the model, would soon take to the public address system and ask for a price check on ladies' lingerie.
 ''I think this is about reminding people about the rush you get from shopping,'' Mr. Kors said. ''Whenever I'm shopping and someone says, 'Oh, would you like me to put that in your bag?' I'm like, 'No, I want another bag!' I like too many bags!''
 Similar events intended to encourage shopping were being held in Paris, Milan and other cities around the world on Thursday. Mayor Bloomberg, once he arrived at Macy's, said fashion was a $10 billion industry that employed 175,000 people in New York City, which has more apparel-related businesses than Paris. But it was impossible to gauge the immediate impact of the shopping parties, or whether they will have a long-term effect on consumer attitudes. Mr. Lundgren said he was confident that sales on Thursday night would at least cover the expense of keeping eight Macy's stores nationwide open late for the promotion. 
 Not everyone was buying it, or buying anything, for that matter, but thousands of people still came out to see celebrities and famous designers in stores around the city. Donna Karan and the Olsen twins were at Bergdorf Goodman, Justin Timberlake at Saks Fifth Avenue and Gwen Stefani at Bloomingdale's, creating one of the most visible fashion industry initiatives in recent memory. It had at least one clearly positive result for retailers: they were busy.
 ''For now I'm drinking and hanging out with friends,'' said Charysh Randolph, a pharmacy student who was shopping at Opening Ceremony, a designer boutique in SoHo. ''I'm holding out. I'll check out all the stores and see what I can afford.'' 
 That store had taken on the raucous air of a street bazaar, with a parade of funky-looking battered vans parked along Howard Street that were a spoof on the knockoff vendors of Canal Street. Instead of fake Louis Vuitton handbags, the vans contained an assortment of Alexander Wang muscle T-shirts for $90 and Band of Outsider neckties for $20 to $100. 
 ''This is incredible,'' said Cheryl Taruc, who was examining a draped jersey party frock. 
 But did it tempt her? 
 ''Maybe not,'' she confided. The event, she said, was ''effective in terms of speaking to my aspirations and desires, but maybe not my pocketbook.'' 
 Madison Avenue was thronged with people along what was once the golden stretch, from East 57th to East 72nd Streets. Women teetered in stilettos and '80s glitter glad rags. Guys strode along in suits with flood pants. They were going places fast, but were they shopping? 
 At Barneys New York, there was something to amuse prospective buyers on every floor: T-shirts being hand-painted by artists from the denim label Loomstate, hand massages for women on the beauty floor, salsa lessons at Juan Carlos Obando's space on the third floor, and Thom Browne meeting fans on the fourth floor. 
 The key to the future of fashion retailing, Mr. Browne said, is to be more responsive to consumers' needs and fulfill their desires. For him, that means selling suits for less than $4,000.
 ''You have to do it and still not lose what you do,'' he said, motioning to a customer who had made a purchase while he was talking -- a bomber jacket that cost about the same as a used car.

ART
 Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.comart. 
 Museums
 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: PATRICIA CRONIN: 'HARRIET HOSMER, LOST AND FOUND,' through Jan. 24. The contemporary New York artist Patricia Cronin channels the life and art of the 19th-century American sculptor Harriet Hosmer (1830-1908) in a show of watercolor depictions of Hosmer's works, both those that survived and those no longer traceable. Ms. Cronin has also published the watercolors -- including her ghost images of missing works -- in a scholarly book that stands as a Hosmer catalogue raisonne. The result is a complex package: a total work of art that is a historical document of the careers of two artists and a homage by one woman to another. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park , (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter)20090910 
 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'REFLECTIONS ON THE ELECTRIC MIRROR: NEW FEMINIST VIDEO,' through Jan. 10. Q: What is feminist video? A: A good way to reduce overcrowding in museums. Unless, that is, you are referring to this entertaining exhibition of recent videos by nine artists featuring the creators themselves as performers. Works by Klara Liden, Kate Gilmore, Cathy Begien and the team of Harry Dodge and Stanya Kahn are variously funny, dark and poetic. Starring in antique-looking, silent-movie-style commercials, Shannon Plumb is a wonderfully agile physical comedian. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park , (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson)20090910
 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'YINKA SHONIBARE MBE,' through Sept. 20. This is an important show for Mr. Shonibare, a British-Nigerian artist who emerged in the late 1990s and was made a member of the Order of the British Empire in 2005. His sculptural tableaus, which revolve around Victorian-era costumes made from 20th-century fabrics associated with Africa, are riotously colorful; their themes of frivolity and excess feel current. But with few exceptions, Mr. Shonibare serves his post-colonialism straight up. The show is rescued by smart integration with the permanent collection: a kind of scavenger hunt through the museum's American period rooms, where Mr. Shonibare's figures of children at play inhabit historical settings. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park , (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Karen Rosenberg)20090910
 INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'AVEDON FASHION: 1944-2000,' through Sept. 20. The first museum retrospective devoted to Richard Avedon's fashion photography exudes a contagious joie de vivre. With postwar Paris as a stage set, Avedon made fashion photography new by adding movement and then narrative to his images, along with ironic self-awareness and a buoyant exuberance. The best of his early images are as perfect as the best work of Jackson Pollock or Jasper Johns from this period, and as profoundly representative of it. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street , (212) 857-0000, www.icp.org. (Roberta Smith)20090910
 THE JEWISH MUSEUM: 'THEY CALLED ME MAYER JULY: PAINTED MEMORIES OF A JEWISH CHILDHOOD IN POLAND BEFORE THE HOLOCAUST,' through Oct. 1. Introducing the reluctant painter and accidental memoirist Mayer Kirshenblatt, now 92, who has devoted the last two decades to documenting life between the wars in and around the provincial city of Opatow (Apt in Yiddish), Poland. Wrought with irresistible detail and folk-art dispatch, the paintings begin with his mother's kitchen and reflect an omnivorous curiosity about everyday everything, aided by an apparently photographic memory. Labels pick up where the paintings leave off; words and images combine in a marvel of a book accomplished in collaboration with the artist's daughter, a folklorist whose career choice was shaped by her father's stories. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street , (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Smith)20090910
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'AFGHANISTAN: HIDDEN TREASURES FROM THE NATIONAL MUSEUM, KABUL,' through Sept. 20. The 200 pre-Islamic objects in this important and moving show date from the Bronze Age to the first century A.D. They dropped from sight during the country's recent turmoil, which was deadly for both people and artwork alike. Courageous curators were their salvation; the rediscovery of the pieces was a moment of national thanksgiving. Consisting of vessels, sculpture, architectural ornaments, jewelry and furniture decoration made of bronze, stone, glass, ceramic, ivory, gold and gemstone, they attest to an astounding cosmopolitanism and diverse cultural heritage. Once, many trade routes led through Afghanistan, and proof of its former centrality is both dazzling and heartening. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)20090910
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'TIBETAN ARMS AND ARMOR FROM THE PERMANENT COLLECTION,' through fall 2010. The paradox of militant Buddhism inspired the Metropolitan's fascinating 2006 exhibition ''Warriors of the Himalayas: Rediscovering the Arms and Armor of Tibet.'' Now Donald LaRocca, the museum's arms and armor curator, has created a follow-up installation of 35 objects from the Met's collection (including 5 acquired in 2007). This time the focus is on defense rather than offense: examples of horse and body armor, dating from the 15th through the 20th centuries, outnumber swords, guns and spears. Most of these objects have seen more ceremonial than military action. All of them equate supreme craftsmanship with defense of the body and Buddhist principles. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)20090910
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'CINNABAR: THE CHINESE ART OF CARVED LACQUER,' through Feb. 21. The exhibition's approximately 50 carved lacquer dishes, platters, boxes, vases and other domestic objects -- including a spectacular folding screen -- are as engrossing for their formal beauty as for their amazing craftsmanship. The pigment cinnabar gives them a rich, dark red color, and intricate patterns, ornamental animals and pastoral vignettes carved and incised into their lustrous surfaces make every object a pleasure to behold. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)20090910
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'ROXY PAINE ON THE ROOF: MAELSTROM,' through Nov. 29. An awesome spectacle awaits visitors to the museum's roof garden: a gnarly thicket of trees and branches extending from one end of the open-air deck to the other. It looks as if a tornado had ripped through Central Park and deposited its gleanings here -- except that it is all made of shiny metal pipe, as if all that wood had been transformed by someone with a stainless-steel Midas touch. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)20090910
 MUSEUM OF BIBLICAL ART: 'SCRIPTURE FOR THE EYES: BIBLE ILLUSTRATION IN NETHERLANDISH PRINTS OF THE 16TH CENTURY,' through Sept. 27. Abounding in sex, violence and supernatural happenings, the Bible has been a great source of inspiration for visual artists. This superb show features pieces by some of the biggest names in the history of Western printmaking. Woodcuts and engravings by Lucas van Leyden and Hendrick Goltzius alone would make a visit to the museum worthwhile, but among the 79 works on view there are lots more wildly imaginative and technically amazing feats of printmaking. 1865 Broadway, at 61st Street , (212) 408-1500, mobia.org.

 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'RON ARAD: NO DISCIPLINE,' through Oct. 19. The first large American survey of this Israeli-born, London-based designer proves some of the virtues but many of the vices of its subtitle. Rambunctious, installed to poor advantage and ultimately inconclusive, it demonstrates with only mediocre results Mr. Arad's ambition to extend the design discipline into architecture and sculpture. There are too many toys for rich people here, along with evidence that when Mr. Arad sticks closest to functional design, he also comes closest to art. You have to set limits to transcend them. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)20090910
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'COMPASS IN HAND: SELECTIONS FROM THE JUDITH ROTHSCHILD FOUNDATION CONTEMPORARY DRAWINGS COLLECTION,' through Jan. 4. The Modern's largest gift of drawings -- a windfall of 2,500 works by 650 artists -- started out as a kind of stunt and matured without becoming a triumph. Initially a yearlong shopping binge in pursuit of a ''cross section'' of drawing at a certain moment, it also tried to fill decades-old gaps in the Modern's drawing collection, often with works by familiar names. These dominate the sampling of the gift: a lackluster exhibition of 354 works by 177 artists that emphasizes the Modern's ambivalence about moving beyond the Minimalism/Post-Minimalist canon, and its tendency to pick big or hot names over truly great drawings. The bottom line? Connoisseurship matters. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)20090910
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'WHAT WAS GOOD DESIGN? MOMA'S MESSAGE, 1944-1956,' through Nov. 30. With 102 objects and excellent labels, the Modern explores its role as arbiter of postwar American design, when, channeling the Bauhaus, it deemed good, affordable design a human right. Its campaign included exhibitions titled ''What Is Good Design?,'' design competitions and use of the MoMA seal of approval by selected department stores. Signature items like the Eames storage unit and the Chemex coffee maker mingle with surprises like a back-to-basics chair of string and wood by, of all people, Alexey Brodovitch, Harper's Bazaar's influential art director. The prevailing sense of beauty, restraint and economy is an implicit rebuke to today's inane material excesses. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)20090910
 NEUE GALERIE: 'FOCUS: OSKAR KOKOSCHKA, WORKS FROM THE PERMANENT COLLECTION,' through Oct. 5. More a taste whetter than a substantial introduction, this exhibition presents six of the Expressionist portraits that made Kokoschka's reputation in the pre-World War I era and about 40 works on paper. The early paintings of eminent Viennese citizens still pack a considerable psychological punch. The gaunt, hollow-eyed ''Martha Hirsch (Dreaming Woman)'' projects an eerie, erotic charm, while her male counterparts resemble zombies and mad professors. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street , (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Johnson)20090910
 NEW MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY ART: 'DOROTHY IANNONE: LIONESS,' through Oct. 18. High priestess, matriarch, sex goddess: the self-taught American artist Dorothy Iannone has been called all these things and more. Now, at 75, Ms. Iannone is having her first solo show at an American museum. It includes just a smattering of early work: four paintings, one sculpture, an artist's book and a series of wooden cutouts. It is complemented, however, by an exhibition at the Anton Kern Gallery in Chelsea that spans the 1960s to the present. Both shows deliver an invigorating shock to an art world lulled, as of late, by the tasteful, conservative and blue-chip. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street , (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)20090910
 NEW MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY ART: 'INTERSECTIONS INTERSECTED: THE PHOTOGRAPHY OF DAVID GOLDBLATT,' through Oct. 11. Celebrated internationally for his socially engaged photography, Mr. Goldblatt has been producing deceptively understated photographs in South Africa since the early '60s. His landscapes, urban scenes and portraits do not show the kinds of horrific images you might expect of witness-bearing photography in the land of apartheid and its violent aftermath, but their reticence speaks volumes. The 114 subtly elegant pictures in this slow-burning show cast a spell of love and mourning. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side , (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Johnson)20090910
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'DAN GRAHAM: BEYOND,' through Oct. 11. This beautifully installed retrospective pays tribute to an influential artist who doesn't necessarily call himself that, and it tends to bear him out. Most impressive are a series of early Conceptual artworks involving surgically precise uses of language and magazines; a series of deadpan, Minimalist-inspired photographs of New Jersey architecture; and ''Rock My Religion,'' an imaginative video about the roots of rock 'n' roll. The video installations and walk-in glass-and-mirror pavilions -- admired because they are interactive -- quickly grow tedious or gimmicky. The many artists who claim Mr. Graham as precedent may surpass him, but there is more than one way to be important. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith)20090910
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'SADIE BENNING: PLAY PAUSE,' through Sept. 20. A new stop-action animation by this former film prodigy uses an avalanche of simple, almost naive gouache drawings, sometimes tinted with color, to prowl the margins of urban society. The result is low-key with undercurrents: a picture of the everyday sublime riddled with suggestions of longing, otherness and the difficulties of connection. Solveig Nelson has provided its beautifully accurate (yet largely electronic) soundtrack of city sounds, whether a subway singer or squirrels rifling through a garbage can, people talking in a bar or gates being called in an airport. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith)20090910
 Galleries: 57th Street
 'PAUL JENKINS IN THE 1960S AND 1970S: SPACE, COLOR AND LIGHT,' through Sept. 25. While seriously overhung, this exhibition affords a rare, extensive look at the work of an artist who borrowed from Abstract Expressionism and then Color Field painting to devise flowing, billowing veils of color that dazzle with their formal acrobatics and luminous, jewel-toned hues. Working with his well-known ivory knives, Mr. Jenkins makes his colors leap, overlap and splinter, pitting them against whiplash lines and stark white backgrounds that increase their luminosity. His paintings have frequently been too gorgeous for their own good, which means that they can verge on slick. But the selection here shows him at the height of his powers. D. Wigmore Fine Art, 730 Fifth Avenue , (212) 581-1657, dwigmore.com. (Smith)20090910
 Galleries: Chelsea
 'THE FEMALE GAZE: WOMEN LOOK AT WOMEN,' through Sept. 19. With a photograph by the eminent Victorian photographer Julia-Margaret Cameron -- as well as paintings by Joan Mitchell and Marlene Dumas, a video by Lynda Benglis and recent sculptures by Louise Bourgeois and Vanessa Beecroft -- this exhibition not only counters the so-called male gaze traditional to Western art with instances of the female one, it also represents a complexity of viewpoints that throws the entire gender-based dichotomy into question. Lust, love, desire and the urge for power can all be found in the works here, some of which could easily have been made by men (not necessarily a bad thing). But there are also above-average levels of empathy, autonomy and dignity in play, and a fascinating process of recontextualization. Cheim & Read, 547 West 25th Street , (212) 242-7727, cheimread.com. (Smith)20090910
 'NAKED!,' through Sept. 19. Although it includes some images of men, a more accurate title for this entertainingly lubricious exhibition would be ''Naked Women of Childbearing Age.'' A big part of the show's appeal is its wacky eclecticism. The 44 works range from a 1626 painting of the river god Alpheus chasing the nymph Arethusa, by Moyses van Uyttenbroeck, to Mel Ramos's 2007 sculpture of a voluptuous woman emerging from an open banana peel. Paul Kasmin Gallery, 293 10th Avenue, at 27th Street , (212) 563-4474, paulkasmingallery.com. (Johnson)20090910
 'PHASE TWO,' through Oct. 25. For a glimpse of the future of contemporary art, or at least a slice of that future, spend some time with the second round of exhibitions at X Initiative. Each of the three largest provides immersion in the work of a young, promising European artist working in time-based mediums. Luke Fowler's films about artists and eccentrics push the documentary form into art. Keren Cytter's visceral videos wreak havoc with numerous cinematic genres and a few from television. Tris Vonna-Michell combines slide projections and recordings of his rapid-fire spoken-word performances to trace his experiences in ways both random and crazily obsessive. X-Initiative, 548 West 22nd Street , (917) 697-4886, x-initiative.org. (Smith)20090910
 Public Art
 'PLOT/09: THIS WORLD & NEARER ONES,' through Sept. 20. The big draw in the city's first quadrennial of public art -- an exhibition of 19 site-specific works organized by Creative Time on Governors Island -- is the beautiful, haunted, car-free island itself. Standouts among the uneven melange of artworks include videos by Guido van der Werve, Adam Chodzko, Judi Werthein and the ingenious Bruce High Quality Foundation. Outdoors, beyond the dark rooms, Susan Philipsz, Teresa Margolles, Tue Greenfort, Mark Wallinger and especially Klaus Weber also add substance. But the degree of site-specificity fluctuates wildly, and the concept as a whole is inadvertently called into question. (212) 206-6674, creativetime.org. (Smith)20090910
 Out of Town
 NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART: 'THE ART OF POWER: ROYAL ARMOR AND PORTRAITS FROM IMPERIAL SPAIN,' through Nov. 1. Drawn from the Royal Armory in Madrid, one of the oldest and greatest repositories of armor in the world, this exhibition presents full suits of armor, as well as individual helmets, shields, swords and armor for horses. There are portraits of 16th- and 17th-century Spanish kings in armor, too, and three spectacular tapestries. But it is the sumptuous metalwork, produced not for warfare but for ceremonial occasions, that is the main attraction. National Mall, Fourth and Constitution Avenue NW, Washington , (202) 737-4215, nga.gov. (Johnson)20090910
 Last Chance
 ASIA SOCIETY: YANG FUDONG: 'SEVEN INTELLECTUALS IN A BAMBOO FOREST'; closes on Sunday. Presented in its five-hour entirety for the first time in a United States museum, Mr. Yang's hypnotic five-part black-and-white movie, ''Seven Intellectuals in a Bamboo Forest,'' tracks the dreamlike meanderings of a group of fashion-model-pretty young people, from a breathtaking mountain summit to a busy city where the disjunctive imagery becomes increasingly surrealistic and comical. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street , (212) 288-6400, asiasociety.org. (Johnson)20090910
 BRONX MUSEUM OF THE ARTS: 'LIVING AND DREAMING'; closes on Sunday. This annual exhibition presents works by young artists who have completed a preparatory program for careers as professionals. Most look as if they could use a few more years of seasoning, but a handful appear to be artists to keep an eye on. The highlights include Eva Davidova's surreal videos; Meredith Drum's enigmatic, low-budget sci-fi film; Nathan Bennett's walk-in room resembling a set for a Stanley Kubrick space odyssey; and Jeffrey Hargrave's mock-racist caricatures. 1040 Grand Concourse, at 165th Street, Morrisania , (718) 681-6000, bronxmuseum.org. (Johnson)20090910
 'GLITZ & GRIME: PHOTOGRAPHS OF TIMES SQUARE'; closes on Saturday. This group show's 24 photographs, dating from 1945 to 2009, chronicle the highs and lows of Times Square, a place that embodies the spirit of American commercial culture at its most seamy and manically exuberant. Yancey Richardson, 535 West 22nd Street, Chelsea , (646) 230-9610, yanceyrichardson.com. (Johnson)20090910
 MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'PAGES OF GOLD: MEDIEVAL ILLUMINATIONS FROM THE MORGAN'; closes on Sunday. This quietly compelling show assembles ''orphan'' leaves (illuminated pages separated from medieval manuscripts and sold, individually, to collectors). Organized geographically, the show allows a comparison of illumination styles in England, Italy, Spain and other countries and regions. It also highlights the figures who created and participated in the market for single leaves. They include an Italian abbot, an English art historian and a mysterious artist known as the Spanish Forger. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street , (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Rosenberg)20090910
 P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'JONATHAN HOROWITZ: AND/OR'; closes on Monday. Andy Warhol's grandchildren, numerous beyond count, have cashed in on his rich and radical legacy to see what further possibilities it might yield. Such is the case with the New York artist Jonathan Horowitz in this smart, crisply edited retrospective. The works evoke the media-saturated art of the 1970s, the neo-Conceptualist consumer art of the 1980s and the identity art of the 1990s, landing in a Never-Neverland era, in which analog is poised to turn to digital, and Doris Day and Paris Hilton have equal currency. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens , (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Cotter)20090910
 'SUMMER PICTURES'; closes on Saturday. When it comes to painting, the fashion designer Isaac Mizrahi knows what he likes and then some. His group show of works by friends and one relative transcends such connections and explores issues like landscape, still life, breakfast and color -- especially color. The artists include Jane Freilicher, Maureen Gallace, Wayne Thiebaud, Maira Kalman and Adrianne Lobel (a theatrical designer). Their work looks fresh and diverse, like a party of people who don't know one another, but end up getting along famously.

HEADLINE: Back Into the Deep End

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
Like millions of ordinary investors, Cindy and Eric Canup are still recovering from Wall Street's big downturn. Their portfolio is off by 25 percent. They are mindful of their spending. And their dreams of buying land in Northern California or Oregon have been delayed five to 10 years, until they can rebuild their retirement accounts.
 Yet with no guarantee they will ever be made whole again, individual investors like the Canups, who live in Oakland, Calif., are sticking with the stock market. Recently, with help from their financial adviser, they nudged some of their cash into mutual funds and took on riskier investments. They have even stopped tossing unopened 401(k) statements into a filing cabinet. 
 ''This time last year it was doom and gloom and dire,'' said Ms. Canup, 48, who works for the health care provider Kaiser Permanente. ''I'm kind of amazed that we're able to get back in as quickly as we are.'' 
 When the financial crisis hit, some of Wall Street's prophets warned that individual investors would be lost for years. The gospel of building a diversified portfolio, buying regularly and holding on till retirement, appeared dead. But despite a rout that erased fortunes and upended retirement plans, few smaller investors have folded their portfolios or cashed out: While they are poorer today and still leery of the markets' returns, many are still chasing the gilded promise of profits and wealth. 
 ''It's got a track record,'' Linda Blay, a bookkeeper in Orange County, Calif., said of the stock market. While her portfolio is still off by 30 percent, she said that ''it outperforms any investment. I think it'll come back.''
 Participation in 401(k) plans held steady in 2008, even as the average account lost 28 percent of its value, according to Hewitt Associates, which tracks retirement plans. More people moved their money into cash or bonds for safety, but they did so at the margins. Over all, the contribution rate dropped less than half a percentage point.
 And in the first half of 2009, when stocks hit their worst levels and then pivoted higher, only 9 percent of investors made trades in their 401(k) accounts, according to Vanguard. At the same time, alternative investments like real estate have suffered mightily, while interest rates on certificates of deposit or even high-yield savings accounts have plunged, making them less attractive.
 ''Inertia has really ruled,'' said Pamela Hess, director of retirement research at Hewitt. ''The vast majority of participants have changed nothing -- not if they save, not how much they save. Nothing.''
 Now, some of the money that fled stocks for safe harbors like money-market funds and government bonds last year is beginning to return. Even with trillions still sheltered on the sidelines, some $56 billion has poured into equity funds since April, according to the Investment Company Institute.
 Of course, making money again can do a lot to bolster anybody's confidence. 
 Over all, the average Vanguard 401(k) balance grew by $3,300 through the end of June, up about 6 percent for the year -- not a great return, but better than before, according to the firm's most recent numbers. In the first six months of 2008, the average Vanguard account lost $6,898, or nearly 9 percent, of its value.
 As of Thursday the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up about 10 percent for the year. But the index is still down a third from its peak, and investors are uncertain whether stocks will continue to rise in a fitful recovery hampered by high unemployment and sluggish consumer spending. Even with 10 percent annual returns, it would take typical stock investors close to three years to recoup the funds they had at the beginning of 2008. 
 Daniel Kelhoffer, 67, an investor in Georgia, visited his son in Germany this summer and cruised the lake near his house in his wooden 1959 Chris-Craft motorboat, encouraged by the steady rise in his monthly account statements. Joseph Fredrick, an investor in Cincinnati, exulted that, largely because of his financial adviser, his portfolio had fallen only 12 percent since the market tanked.
 In North Carolina, a retired Wachovia executive, Robert Paynter, lost tens of thousands of dollars when his stock options and Wachovia shares hit the skids. In October, he told The New York Times that he felt as if he were witnessing his own death with each plunge of the stock market. This summer, he bought a year-old Corvette convertible. And while he and his wife canceled a trip to Europe, they are contemplating a Mediterranean cruise next year.
 ''I'm feeling a whole lot better,'' he said. ''As ugly as it got, I never got to a point where I thought I was going to have to go back to work or miss a meal. I can take a lot bigger hit than I thought I could.''
 After the crash, Gil Livingston, a retired Hewlett-Packard manager from suburban Detroit, decided he would manage his own money instead of letting asset managers at UBS handle his portfolio. He missed the bottom of the market in early March, but has made money from well-timed purchases of technology stocks and investments in emerging markets. 
 ''I'm slowly sticking my head back out of the ground,'' he said. ''I'm doing fairly well. My equities are up.''
 Mr. Livingston, 67, and his wife still have a winter home in Cape Canaveral, Fla., and say they have not been forced to curtail their lifestyles. With their portfolio off by 20 percent, though, they have put off traveling and are considering whether to raise some cash by trading in their Michigan home for something smaller. 
 But many are more deeply scarred from the financial and psychological effects of their losses. 
 Last autumn, as his retirement account was plummeting in value, Joe Mancini decided to sell some financial stocks and seek more conservative investments like bonds, gold and metals funds. Even though he was able to cut his losses, he and his wife are still down about 30 percent.
 ''A few years ago I was hoping to retire when I got close to 60,'' said Mr. Mancini, who is 58 and works for an electronics equipment distributor. ''I can't even put a date on it now.''
 If thriftier consumers become a legacy of the recession, Wall Street's plunge may have created a generation of more cautious individual investors.
 Robert Furey, who works at a computer company in Naples, Fla., said he had followed all of the conventional rules of investing: he planned for the future, bought a diverse array of stocks, bonds and index funds and never tried to time the markets. He lost a decade's worth of gains when the stock market plunged, and said he did not know whether he would ever trust the markets again.
 ''I was a deer in the headlights,'' he said.
 As Wall Street raced higher in the last few years, Ben Silbert, 38, a corporate lawyer in Manhattan, said he tried to talk his wife into funneling more of their money into stocks. But now, with their portfolio down 15 percent since last August, Mr. Silbert said he wanted to make a shift toward fixed-income investments.
 ''I've seen what can happen,'' he said. ''It's been a good lesson. It's been an eye opener for me.''

HEADLINE: Seaside Resort of a Certain Age Enjoys an Eclectic Renaissance

BYLINE: By CHARLES ISHERWOOD

 BODY:
ASBURY PARK, N.J.
 THE past stands vigil over the present in this once-faded beach resort that has been evolving in recent years into a newly appealing summer weekend destination -- or a year-round refuge -- for an eclectic population. 
 At one end of the central stretch of boardwalk, the beautiful old convention hall, a gold-brick pile with delicate wedding-cake trim, announces ''Greetings From Asbury Park'' to Ocean Avenue and beyond in old-fashioned yellow lights. The phrase was immortalized by the local boy made good Bruce Springsteen (he grew up in nearby Freehold), as the title of his debut album back in 1973. At the other end rest the elegant shell of the casino and the carousel building, now sadly empty of carousel, as if the prancing horses had fled for more profitable pastures. (Dancing men moved in temporarily this summer: a production of the musical ''Full Monty'' from the ReVision Theater was preparing to open in the space when I visited.) 
 But in between these venerable landmarks much is bustling, busy and almost brand new. A high-end tchotchke emporium called Bodega sells fancy candles and vintage paperbacks with lurid covers in pristine condition. Furniture stores with trendy names like the Posh Den court sun-dazed beachgoers. Stella Marina, a giant, gleaming new trattoria, does frenzied business late into the night, just next door to an upstairs bar, Watermark, that almost looks like a transplant from Manhattan but with soothing views of the moon and stars over a silvered stretch of ocean. 
 Like many cities and towns poised between decay and regeneration, Asbury Park bewitches with hints of faded charm as well as a growing array of creature comforts. Although it was a popular middle-class summer destination for much of the 20th century, it endured decades of economic decline following race riots in 1970. Talk of a revival has ebbed and flowed for the past several decades. As is often the case in a town in a process of renewal, gay men and lesbians have a significant presence and deserve considerable credit for the current reawakening. 
 Today, as it happens, among the most welcoming aspects of Asbury Park is an easygoing embrace of all kinds of visitors and residents. Summer resorts often cater to niches of humanity. Well-heeled Manhattanites, for example, hie to the Hamptons. In Fire Island Pines it is not unusual to encounter a sculptured male beauty shopping for vegetables in a bikini, but a man and woman pushing a stroller along the wooden walkways would be a lot more surprising. On the beach at Asbury Park you cannot even be sure a rainbow-hued umbrella signifies anything. Black and white, gay and straight, child-ridden and child-free: there's a little of everything, and everyone seems to feel at home. 
 Evidence of the quickening pace of renewal is hard to miss in these days, notwithstanding the economic tremors of the last year. New establishments pepper Cookman Avenue, a funky retail stretch and a nice place to dawdle away a day of beach fatigue. With its cluttered stores full of mid-century furniture, smartly chosen home collections and vintage clothing, the strip feels a lot like the East Village in the 1980s. The prices also inspire nostalgia for those more economically innocent times. Vintage T-shirts that would run you $50 or more in Manhattan can be had for considerably less at stores like B Unique, a new boutique with a retro-rock feeling.
 But there are also ''only in New Jersey'' novelties. Less than a year old is Paranormal Books and Curiosities, presided over by the amiable proprietor, Kathy Kelly, where you can buy a Ouija board, keep up with the latest in fang lit or sign up for a ghosts and legends walk through the city by night with an emphasis on its haunted history. (In 1934 a luxury liner returning to New York from Cuba, the Morro Castle, caught fire in mysterious circumstances during a storm at sea; it eventually drifted to the Asbury Park shore, where it became a macabre tourist attraction.) 
 Also new is the Silverball Pinball Museum, a big basement rec room where dozens of classic pinball machines are kept in mint working condition. Don't worry about bringing a roll of quarters. You pay by the hour ($10) or buy a longer pass and can flip to your heart's content. Placards note each machine's significance in the history of pinballing, as the simple wooden boxes of the 1950s morphed into the electronic monsters of the 1980s before the advent of video changed gaming for good. 
 But anyone with even a vestige of affection for youthful days spent wasting the allowance with Captain Fantastic or whiling away a dull night at the bar trying to beat the top score on the Charlie's Angels machine won't be reading about arcade arcana for long. My inner forearms -- for lack of the proper term -- were sore for two days after just an hour of frenzied play. 
 Nor do the city's seductive retro amusements stop at pinball. I also bowled for the first time in at least a decade at Asbury Lanes. Hipster alleys are not exactly novel these days in major cities, but this appealingly scruffy hall, in operation since 1961, blends its old-school amenities (skeevy bathroom included) and hipster credentials (a D.J. playing '80s New Wave) with an authenticity that doesn't seem strained. Here, you feel, the cool kids inevitably started hanging out because it was one of the few local places that stayed open late and served drinks. 
 It is now one of the cutting-edge music spots in this music-rich town. A fierce funk-rock band was just concluding its set when a friend and I stepped in to escape the rain on a recent Saturday night. The bandstand is plopped on top of the middle lanes, but you can still bowl in the outer lanes. So we did, even as a nouveau-burlesque show took over the stage. Had I not needed all my wits to avoid the humiliation of repeated gutter balls, I'm sure I would have taken more time to appreciate the dance stylings of Mlles. Gigi LaFemme, Sapphire Jones, Anita Cookie and Sizzle Dizzle. 
 A lineup of such exotic handles you might almost expect to see on a drag bill at the Paradise club in the Empress Hotel, the great gaudy dowager that forms the centerpiece of gay nightlife in Asbury Park. Located just opposite the boardwalk on Ocean Avenue, this classically undistinguished bit of midcentury hotel architecture turns into a throbbing disco queen at night. Gem-colored lights play across the facade, and the crowd at the Paradise spills out into the pool area, where you can check out the men (and women) while idling on a lounge chair, or try to forestall a hangover with a barbecued burger. 
 Odd juxtapositions -- bowling and burlesque, burgers frying beside a pool at a gay bar, a spanking-new condo complex with views of a vacant lot dotted with cement slabs like tombstones -- are a hallmark of today's Asbury Park. The city's revival may hit a few speed bumps, but it's comforting to be reminded that the most interesting times are often the least tidy.
 IF YOU GO
 WHERE TO STAY
 The Hotel Tides is (408 Seventh Avenue; 732-897-7744; hoteltides.com) sleek and newly renovated, this boutique hotel is tucked into a residential neighborhood 10 minutes' walk to the beach. Rooms are appointed in cool modern furnishings, and there's a full bar downstairs as well as an French fusion-theme restaurant and pool. Double rooms are about $200 during the summer season. 
 WHERE TO EAT
 Stella Marina (800 Ocean Avenue; 732-775-7776; stellamarinarestaurant.com) is big and loud, but the quality and range of its Italian menu -- cicchetti, antipasti, pizza, pasta and secondi -- is impressive. Entrees are all under $30, and pastas are $17. Reservations are recommended, but if you reserve, you won't necessarily have the option of sitting on the upstairs patio, which is quieter. 
 Taka (632 Mattison Avenue; 732-775-1020; takaapnj.com) mixes a wide range of Japanese classics and more unusual fare like braised short ribs in an appealingly airy space a few minutes' walk from the beach. Entrees are under $30, but you need to bring your own beer or wine. 
 Il Pavone Gelateria and Caffe (539 Cookman Avenue; 732-455-3373; ilpavonegelato.com) is a great place for a break along the city's most appealing retail strip, with excellent gelati. 
 WHAT TO DO 
 Beach badges (information at 732-775-0900) are required; daily passes are $5 for those over age 12; seasonal rates are available.
 Asbury Lanes (209 Fourth Avenue; 732-776-6160; asburylanes.com) is your one-stop rock 'n' roll and bowling venue, with a cool bar too. The Web site has the lineup and hours of operation. 
 Silverball Pinball Museum (639 Cookman Avenue; 732-774-4994; silverballmuseum.com) offers a break from the sun and a ticket to the careless pleasures of youth. Open until 9 p.m. on weeknights and 11 p.m. Friday and Saturday. $10 for an hour of unlimited play.

HEADLINE: U.S. Jobless Claims Fall More Than Forecast

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
First-time claims for jobless benefits fell more than expected last week, evidence that companies are laying off fewer workers as the economy improves.
 The Labor Department said in a statement that its initial claims for unemployment insurance fell to a seasonally adjusted 550,000 from an upwardly revised 576,000 in the previous week. Analysts expected claims to drop to 560,000, according to Thomson Reuters. 
 The number of people continuing to receive benefits fell by 159,000 to nearly 6.1 million, the lowest level since early April.
 The economy is showing consistent signs that the worst recession since the 1930s may be over. The Federal Reserve said Wednesday that 11 of its 12 regional banks reported the economy is stabilizing, an improvement from previous reports.
 Still, the unemployment claims remain significantly above levels associated with a healthy economy and indicate that jobs remain scarce. Weekly initial claims are generally at 325,000 or below in a growing economy. A year ago, only 3.5 million people were receiving unemployment aid.
 Economists closely watch initial claims, which are considered a gauge of layoffs and an indication of companies' willingness to hire new workers.
 While the figures are volatile, first-time claims have trended downward in recent months. Initial claims topped 600,000 for most of this year, until falling below that level in early July.
 The four-week average of claims, which smoothes out fluctuations, fell by 2,750 to 570,000 last week. That was almost 90,000 below the peak for the current recession, reached in early April.
 When federal emergency programs are included, the total number of jobless benefit recipients was 9.16 million people in the week that ended Aug. 22, up from 9.14 million in the previous week. Congress has added up to 53 extra weeks of benefits on top of the 26 typically provided by the states.
 The large number of people remaining on the rolls is an indication that while layoffs may have slowed, companies are still reluctant to hire new employees.
 Job losses have slowed recently. The Labor Department said last week that companies cut 216,000 jobs in August, a large amount but the smallest in a year. The unemployment rate, however, jumped to 9.7 percent from 9.4 percent in July.
 The Fed and many private economists predict the jobless rate will hit 10 percent by the end of this year. The recession so far has eliminated a net total of 6.9 million jobs.
 Among the states, New York had the largest increase in claims of 4,546, which it attributed to greater layoffs in the transportation and service industries. The next largest increases were in Texas, Florida, New Jersey and Georgia. The state data lag initial claims by a week.
 Michigan had the largest drop in claims of 1,915. The next largest decreases were in Ohio, Oregon, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.

HEADLINE: Russia Says Sanctions Against Iran Are Unlikely

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY; David E. Sanger contributed reporting from Washington.

DATELINE: MOSCOW 

 BODY:
Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov on Thursday all but ruled out imposing new sanctions against Iran over its nuclear program, brushing aside growing Western concerns that Iran had made significant progress in recent months in a bid for nuclear weapons.
 Mr. Lavrov said he believed that a new set of proposals that Iran gave to European nations on Wednesday offered a viable basis for negotiations to end the dispute. He said he did not believe that the United Nations Security Council would approve new sanctions against Iran, which could ban Iran from exporting oil or importing gasoline. 
 ''Based on a brief review of the Iranian papers, my impression is there is something there to use,'' Mr. Lavrov said at a gathering of experts on Russia. ''The most important thing is Iran is ready for a comprehensive discussion of the situation, what positive role it can play in Iraq, Afghanistan and the region.''
 Mr. Lavrov's comments underscored the challenge facing the Obama administration as it plans its next move in the United States' longstanding struggle to prevent Iran from producing nuclear weapons.
 Russia is a permanent member of the Security Council, allowing it to veto any sanctions resolution, and it has close economic and diplomatic ties to Iran. 
 Iran says its program to enrich uranium is aimed at producing electricity, and it has refused to halt the process, which can have civilian and military purposes.
 On Thursday, Ali Asghar Soltanieh, Iran's ambassador to the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations' nuclear watchdog, said Iran would not negotiate further with the major powers about its nuclear program, Iranian news services reported.
 A five-page letter that Iran delivered to the European powers, and sent to Washington via the Swiss on Wednesday, is titled a ''Package of Proposals by the Islamic Republic of Iran for Comprehensive and Constructive Negotiations.'' But it is devoid of specifics, and never mentions Iran's nuclear program.
 Instead, the letter, which was published Thursday on the Web site of ProPublica.org, an investigative journalism group, refers in the vaguest terms to ''creating a world filled with spirituality, friendship, prosperity, wellness and security.'' 
 It hews closely to a proposal issued by Iran last year. Among the topics it proposes to discuss is global disarmament, which has been interpreted in Washington as suggesting that Iran wants to link any discussion of the fate of its nuclear program with talks about the arsenals of the United States and Israel, among others.
 On Wednesday the American ambassador to the atomic energy agency, Glyn Davies, declared that Iran had reached ''possible breakout capacity'' -- the ability to acquire enough fuel and expertise to complete building a nuclear weapon relatively quickly -- if it decided to enrich its uranium to bomb-grade.
 President Obama has sought to take a less adversarial stance toward Iran's nuclear program than President George W. Bush did. But with seemingly little to show for it, Mr. Obama may now try to move more aggressively.
 Obtaining the Kremlin's backing is one of his biggest hurdles in doing so, and when Mr. Obama was in Moscow in July, he spoke at length with President Dmitri A. Medvedev about the Iranian nuclear program.
 While the tone of the talks may have appeared promising, the Russian side now seems to be positioning itself as something of an arbiter in the dispute between Iran and the West.
 ''Some of the sanctions under discussion, including oil and oil products, are not a mechanism to force Iran to cooperate,'' Mr. Lavrov said Thursday at a meeting of the Valdai Discussion Club, an annual meeting of Russia experts. ''They are a step to a full-blown blockade, and I do not think they would be supported at the U.N. Security Council.''
 Mr. Lavrov added, ''Iran is a partner that has never harmed Russia in any way.'' 
 Cliff Kupchan, a director at the Eurasia Group, a global risk-consulting firm based in New York, was at the meeting and questioned Mr. Lavrov about Iran.
 ''They derive a lot of influence and prestige by being the point man on Iran,'' Mr. Kupchan said of the Russian officials in an interview. ''I think that they are making clear that they are in the middle of the game. They are stating that the road to Tehran goes through Moscow.''
 Israel has become increasingly anxious about Iran's possible effort to secure both nuclear and conventional weapons, and reports surfaced in Jerusalem this week that the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, made a secret visit to Moscow on Monday to lobby the Kremlin to spurn Iran's requests.
 Mr. Netanyahu's aides have not officially confirmed the trip, and when asked about it on Thursday, Mr. Lavrov referred questions to the Israeli side.
 Mr. Lavrov offered a more categorical denial to unconfirmed reports that a cargo ship that was hijacked off the coast of Europe had been smuggling a sophisticated Russian air-defense system to Iran detected by Israel.
 Israel has repeatedly sought assurances from Russia that it will not deliver the system, the S-300, to Iran.
 The cargo ship disappeared under mysterious circumstances in late July, and the reluctance of the Russian authorities to explain exactly what happened has spawned a raft of rumors. The ship was located in mid-August with its crew safe, and the alleged hijackers were arrested.

HEADLINE: To Counteract Job Search Blues, Volunteer

BYLINE: By PHYLLIS KORKKI

 BODY:
As I wrote in a recent column, being unemployed after a layoff can take a serious emotional toll. Many jobless people must look for work right after being removed from the soothing and predictable structure of working life. They face unaccustomed isolation at the same time that they must brace themselves for rejection. 
 In response to my column, Diane Reynolds, a career coach in New York, said she encourages her clients to counteract these conditions by doing volunteer work: 
 Strong feelings of rejection and loss of self-esteem, coupled with the many nonresponses from potential employers can also lead to a ''why bother looking'' attitude. When job-seekers feel that way, they put less energy into the job hunt and they become less productive. That cuts down on the one activity that can help them out of their dilemma. In short, it can become a vicious circle.
 So crucial is attitude in affecting a job-seeker's productivity, that I help clients put an ''Emotional Uplift Plan'' in place immediately. I advise them that days of job search can often lack what a job gave them -- affirmation, a feeling of accomplishment and a sense of community.
 After two months, I strongly urge them to commit to one day or one half-day of volunteer work weekly. This gives them a feeling of being needed, of making a contribution, and being part of something. At least someone might ask them, ''How was your weekend?''
 Excellent advice. For your own mental well-being, and because you actually have the time now to help others, do try to seek volunteer opportunities -- preferably those that relate to your professional field. Not only will this provide structure and interaction, but also you may be able to put the work on your resume and to get a reference out of the experience.

HEADLINE: Limo Drivers at Open Are Running on Empty

BYLINE: By JOHN BRANCH

 BODY:
Malik Majeed has been driving his black Lincoln Town Car for several years, but business has never been this bleak, he said. Each night during the United States Open, in the shadows beyond the reach of the tall lights at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center and under the tracks of the rumbling No. 7 train, Majeed and dozens of others park their shiny cars and wait for paying passengers.
 This year, for the first time, they sometimes wait for hours upon hours, until they finally give up and go home without giving a single ride or making a single dollar, they said. 
 ''I hate this business,'' Majeed, 30, said. ''If I can get the money, I am the first to leave this job.''
 The Open used to be one of the year's most bankable events for drivers like Majeed. Every day for two weeks, thousands of tennis fans came and went, many carrying corporate tickets and an expense account. Given the option, they would not take the train back to Manhattan, or even a taxi, choosing instead a cushy, reserved back seat of a car service.
 But some of those corporations are gone and many of the expense accounts have dried up. And some of the bitter victims of the sour economy can be found nightly amid the automotive fix-it shops crowded down the potholed roads just a short walk from the Open and Citi Field, home of the Mets. 
 ''Last year, we probably averaged 100 cars at the Open,'' said Larry Liebert, a dispatcher for Executive Transportation Group, standing on the corner connecting incoming phone reservations to a pack of eager drivers. ''This year, it's probably 40 or 50. It's terrible. It's a microcosm of what's going on in the city.''
 Liebert looked around. He spotted only two other on-the-street dispatchers from other companies. In previous years he would see seven or eight. He and others estimated that business for the thousands of for-hire cars, called black cars by the drivers, is half of what it was a year or two ago -- throughout New York City and at the Open.
 A few packs of waiting cars can be found during the day on the edges of nearby Flushing Meadows-Corona Park and on nearby side streets. But when the automotive shops close at 6:30, the cars move in. They back into both sides of Willets Point Boulevard, a dimly lit, rutted lane that juts diagonally from the intersection of Roosevelt Avenue and 126th Street. 
 ''Pakistan has better roads than this,'' one driver said. 
 On Tuesday, more cars crowded in, double parking as darkness settled. Drivers, most from Pakistan or India, huddled in small groups, chatting amicably. Others sat in their cars alone. They waited for a dispatcher to tell them that they would be giving someone a ride, somewhere. About 80 percent of the rides are to Manhattan, drivers said. 
 Aziz Rehman arrived at 3 p.m. on Sunday and parked his car. It did not move until he drove it home nine hours later. The same thing happened Monday. On Tuesday, at about 10 p.m., he got customers needing a ride to Brooklyn. It was a $45 trip. After commissions, fees, gas and insurance, he will probably end up with less than half of that. 
 ''Last year, within one hour, a driver would have a job,'' said Inderit Singh, a dispatcher for Charge & Ride, which had six drivers waiting at Willets Point and one reservation. ''This year, a guy is here at 3 and gets no job. They are lucky to go home with $50. Then how does he feed his children? Get gas?''
 Majeed, another of the Charge & Ride drivers, said he booked $57,000 worth of trips on his 2003 Lincoln last year. So far this year, he said, he has not reached $30,000. He scrolled his BlackBerry and pulled up the company's reservation list. 
 Every New York neighborhood has a code. Downtown Manhattan is 1, and the area around the tennis center and the baseball stadium is 54. 
 The screen showed how many cars were in each neighborhood, and how many reservations existed there. At about 9 p.m. Tuesday, there were 100 cars working around New York City. There were three reservations.
 Reservations are required for black cars, and hustling for fares can be met with steep fines by the Taxi and Limousine Commission. Drivers view the commission with disdain, complaining about its fees, rules and a perceived favoritism toward taxis. Some likened the commission to a vampire, sucking the life from their livelihood. Increasingly, drivers troll for their fares, weary of waiting for reservations that never come. 
 As the hours slid on, and the first of the evening matches ended, fans with black car reservations made their way to Willets Point, where the sound of the organ at Citi Field can be heard and one of the video screens atop Arthur Ashe Stadium can barely be seen. Some ambled through the dim light, looking and calling for the driver matching the company name and car number that they booked. Drivers perked up and held white placards with the information to help make the connection. 
 Majeed was No. 4 in line among drivers from his company, but then a quick flurry of dispatches arrived. One driver was ecstatic to receive a job to Westchester County, a $100 trip. Majeed moved to No. 1 at about 10 p.m., and his mood brightened.
 ''But with one ride I cannot survive,'' he said.
 Activity increased, and Willets Point became a jam of cars and people. Horns honked. The train rumbled by every few minutes. Planes from La Guardia charged overhead. Majeed's phone rang at 11:18. The reservation did not say where the clients were headed, or exactly when.
 ''Hopefully they're going to Jersey,'' he said. And he waited some more.
 It was about midnight when Rafael Nadal won his fourth-round match with Gael Monfils. Majeed was summoned to pick up the customers a couple of blocks closer to the tennis center. 
 Less than an hour later, Majeed was on the phone. It had been a $52 trip to Manhattan's Upper West Side. 
 He headed back home to Queens, his back seat empty again. Another day awaited.

HEADLINE: In Opener, Steelers Win but Suffer a Big Hit

BYLINE: By JUDY BATTISTA

DATELINE: PITTSBURGH 

 BODY:
The bedrock upon which the Pittsburgh Steelers have always been built -- and upon which their hopes for repeating as Super Bowl champions rest -- is their suffocating defense, which confounds opponents with a beguiling mix of violence and deception. 
 But on Thursday night, in the N.F.L.'s season opener, it fell to the Steelers' offense -- and to the sure-footed kicker Jeff Reed -- to conjure a victory out of precious little production from a classic slugfest. When Hines Ward's reliable hands failed them and the ground game disappeared, it was quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, running a no-huddle offense, who sparkled in overtime. Roethlisberger, known for his gut-churning late-game heroics, had led the drive that tied the score late in the fourth quarter with one Reed field goal. 
 The Steelers had nearly averted overtime, but the Tennessee Titans stripped Ward when he was just 5 yards from the end zone and the potential winning touchdown with less than a minute remaining. But in the overtime huddle, Rothlisberger told the rookie receiver Mike Wallace to just keep running, and he did, clutching a 22-yard pass during the first drive of overtime to set up Reed's 33-yard field goal. It gave the Steelers a 13-10 victory, their first of the season and their title defense. 
 ''I told the coaches I didn't want to start this already, a fourth-quarter comeback,'' said Roethlisberger, who completed 18 of 22 passes for 183 yards in the second half and overtime, channeling the poise he showed in leading the Steelers last season. 
 Titans safety Michael Griffin, the man who had stripped Ward, threw his helmet in frustration, but the night produced plenty of angst for the Steelers, too. The defense, and the Steelers' chance of being the first team to repeat since the New England Patriots won in 2003 and 2004, suffered a potentially crippling loss when Troy Polamalu, the whirling dervish safety, left the game with a left knee injury late in the first half and did not return to the sideline. Initial tests indicated a sprained medial collateral ligament, and Coach Mike Tomlin said the range for his return could be three to six weeks. But he stressed that the range was just speculation and he conceded that the damage might be worse. 
 Polamalu's knees have been vulnerable before. In 2006, he missed three games with a M.C.L. injury in his left knee, and in 2007, he missed four games with a posterior cruciate ligament injury in his right knee. 
 Still, the Steelers, with their six Super Bowl championships, are a constant in an ever-changing N.F.L. The new season that kicked off here will be played against the backdrop of empty seats born of economic strife (although not in Pittsburgh, where the 65,110 people who packed Heinz Field set a new franchise attendance record for a regular-season game), labor tension between owners and players, Brett Favre wearing purple in Minnesota, Michael Vick trying to resurrect his career in Philadelphia, and 11 coaches in new jobs and several more worried about keeping theirs. 
 The style the Steelers share with the Titans -- they are built on long-term coaches and stalwart defenses -- won't make any offensive highlight videos. The slugfest that developed Thursday night was rife with mistakes and penalties, a typically sloppy season opener that the Steelers were fortunate to escape.
 ''We talked about big men and blades of grass -- winning the trench warfare, we didn't do that,'' Tomlin said. ''I thought we had to take care of the football and win the turnover battle. We didn't do that. We talked about out-hitting them. The jury is out on that. That last thing we talked about was not riding the emotional roller coaster and being prepared to play 60-plus minutes of football. We did that. We did a great job of it. Such is life in the N.F.L.'' 
 The Titans, the best American Football Conference team in the 2008 regular season, are facing a formidable challenge this season. They lost the dominating defensive tackle Albert Haynesworth to free agency and the Washington Redskins. But on Thursday night, at least, they showed little ill effect, getting pressure on Roethlisberger with their front four defensive linemen and annihilating the running game, which managed just 36 yards as the offensive line struggled to block. The Steelers' offense had success only when Roethlisberger was in hurry-up mode. On the Steelers' first scoring drive, Roethlisberger toyed with the defense with pump fakes and when receiver Santonio Holmes split two safeties on his way to the end zone, Roethlisberger hit him with a 34-yard touchdown pass that provided a nice symmetry to the evening: Holmes had scored the final points of the 2008 season with a leaping winning touchdown catch in the back corner of the end zone at the Super Bowl, and now he has scored the first points of the 2009 season, too. 
 The rest of the season may not be so poetic for the Steelers, though, particularly if Polamalu's absence is for an extended period. His play in the first half before his injury was electric. He made a brilliant leaping, one-handed interception that kept the Titans from getting inside the 5-yard line and had six tackles before he went out. Polamalu was hurt when Alge Crumpler, the mammoth Titans tight end, landed on him as the Steelers blocked a Titans field goal attempt late in the second quarter -- the second Titans field goal to fail in the first half -- and on the Titans next drive, his absence was obvious, with the Titans able to run and pass into wide-open spaces in the secondary on a touchdown drive. 
 ''The standard is the standard for the 11 men on the field for us,'' Tomlin said. 
 It just may not be the 11 they want.

HEADLINE: As High Fashion Falls to Earth, It Faces a Redefining Moment

BYLINE: By CATHY HORYN

 BODY:
.
 The fabric in the hands of Thakoon Panichgul, one of Michelle Obama's favorite designers, is exquisite. An Italian jacquard, woven from yarns of eight different colors, it costs $100 a yard. A dress that Mr. Panichgul plans to make from the cloth for his runway show next week will cost $2,000.
 He lets it fall away. It troubles Mr. Panichgul that as much as people love beautiful clothes, they do not understand why they cost so much. ''It's becoming a losing battle,'' he said.
 Designer fashion -- the creative wellspring of the American apparel industry, the engine of style magazines, the stuff of plain old dreams -- is experiencing a serious case of the blues. As another show season rolls out across the city, against the chilliest retail climate in years, many believe this is not merely a difficult moment for high-end fashion but a defining one as well. 
 Here is the reality: More and more people shop at H & M and other purveyors of cheap chic. Factories offering fine craftsmanship in Italy and New York are closing as business moves to China. Consumers do not see longevity in the clothes they buy. ''I think the true designer business is in trouble, no question about it,'' said a senior buying executive at Macy's, declining to speak on the record because of the company's policies.
 With shoppers afraid to spend, department stores cut orders for fall goods by 30 percent. For next spring -- the collections being shown during New York Fashion Week through Sept. 17 -- little improvement is seen.
 ''In my 40 years in fashion, I've never seen women scared to shop -- at all price levels,'' said Vera Wang, who sells $1,000 dresses at stores like Bergdorf Goodman and also has a low-priced line at Kohl's.
 Retailers have pressured designers like Ms. Wang to lower their prices. Anyone walking through an empty store in recent months could see why this was necessary. On Tuesday, Neiman Marcus reported a $668 million loss for the year. The luxury chain said the latest quarterly sales at stores open at least a year fell 23 percent from the period a year ago. Saks posted a 16 percent drop. On Thursday, the industry tried to excite people with after-hours shopping at stores around the city, called Fashion's Night Out. 
 Makers of high-end fashion wonder how far they can drop prices without diminishing their prestige, or cutting corners that might compromise their creativity.
 Ms. Wang said she cut prices for her resort collection this year by 40 percent, but was told by some stores that those $600 to $800 dresses were maybe too low for a designer brand.
 ''I don't know what's going to happen,'' Ms. Wang said, referring to the future of prestigious labels. ''It's going to be a world of crepe de Chine.''
 Although designer fashion accounts for only a small portion of the $191 billion apparel industry in the United States, and many consumers would not mourn the disappearance of $2,000 dresses from the racks, the creativity of runway collections inspires looks in the mass market and sets trends that entice shoppers back into stores season after season, fueling a vast segment of the economy. 
 In the 40 years since modern ready-to-wear came into existence in Europe and America, and made household names of Ralph, Calvin and Donna, designers have enjoyed enormous respect and prosperity. However, in the past few years, they have lost some face with consumers. Their clothes became exotically pricey as they courted celebrities and did quick-and-dirty deals with makers of fast fashion.
 This week the situation reached a nadir of sorts when the Paris house Emanuel Ungaro -- once the pride and joy of the Upper East Side -- announced that it had hired Lindsay Lohan as its artistic adviser.
 Another impact of recession-driven designing is a retreat to more predictable styles, a repetition of the safe looks that sold well in previous seasons. The designer Elie Tahari, whose labels generate about $500 million in sales, is focusing on dresses, animal prints and leggings and slim pants worn with tunics. 
 ''Fashion has to be new and wearable and there has to be a need to it,'' he said. Mr. Tahari has cut prices by 30 percent and closed a handbag factory he had in Italy to move that production to China. 
 Even Oscar de la Renta, the very emblem of high-end New York design, known for $4,000 and $5,000 dresses and suits, plans to offer a $1,500 dress in his spring line to meet retailers' demands.
 And although he recently bought a local garment factory that had planned to close, to help maintain his label's craft standards, he has also sought out less expensive suppliers in Asia and Eastern Europe. 
 In his Seventh Avenue studio, Mr. de la Renta pointed to a sleeveless black dress with two knitted, frilly panels. The panels, done in Romania and combined with an Italian wool, will help keep the price of the dress down to $2,500. And Mr. de la Renta likes a silk faille that he gets from a mill in South Korea. Aside from the price -- it costs a third of what Italian faille does -- he likes the look. 
 ''Listen, Prada has been using it for years,'' he said.
 European houses, with their savoir-faire and deep pockets -- thanks to leather goods and perfume sales -- may hold a creative edge over American counterparts that will matter in the marketplace. Stores insist that women, while choosier now and prone to mixing styles, can't part with quality altogether.
 ''There are still customers who want that workmanship,'' Ann Stordahl, the general merchandise manager at Neiman's, said. ''There are just fewer of them than there were.''
 But there's a paradox in all this, a slight slub in the fabric. Ultimately, what distinguishes high-end fashion is an appreciation for the small differences: in the fit, the fabric. This is a designer's creative toolbox. Remove a tool, and he has less with which to do his job.
 Joseph Altuzarra, a young designer in New York, specializes in ruched georgette dresses, priced around $2,000, which are made in France. Recently, he asked his factory there if it might simplify the ruching process to lower costs. The factory refused.
 ''They said they would be ashamed to produce a garment that way,'' Mr. Altuzarra recalled.
 Then he took a sample to a New York City factory to see if it might produce garments for him. ''They looked at the sample and passed it around the factory and 15 minutes later said, 'We can't do it,' '' Mr. Altuzarra said. ''It was technically impossible for them to do it.''

CORRECTION-DATE: September 21, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An article on Sept. 11 about cost-cutting methods used by clothing designers included an incorrect statement by Oscar de la Renta about the source of silk faille used by Prada. While Mr. de la Renta said he uses faille from South Korea, Prada says it buys silk only from Italian mills and has not been using the South Korean fabric.

HEADLINE: Councilman Attacks Rivals in Final Primary Debate for Comptroller

BYLINE: By KAREEM FAHIM

 BODY:
In a race that appears destined for a runoff, three of the four Democratic candidates for New York City comptroller spent their final debate on Thursday night avoiding bold moves, wrong steps and, for the most part, sharp attacks on their rivals. The exception was Councilman David I. Weprin, who trails in a Quinnipiac University poll and seemed anxious to upend the race.
 He attacked Councilman John C. Liu, whose parents came to America from Taiwan when he was 5, over his claims that he worked in a sweatshop as a child. 
 ''What has he done to prevent child-labor violations from happening?'' Mr. Weprin asked.
 He reminded the audience that his two other rivals, Councilman David Yassky and Councilwoman Melinda R. Katz, had voted to change term limits. ''After the voters voted twice,'' he scoffed. 
 And, however briefly, Mr. Weprin was able to draw his cautious rivals into his fight, injecting a few moments of excitement into a staid race among candidates with little name recognition, running for a position that many voters hardly understand. 
 The stakes are high. In the midst of a recession, the comptroller is the city's chief financial officer and its auditor, whose duties include serving as an investment adviser and custodian to the city's five pension funds, currently valued at more than $80 billion. 
 Those responsibilities were discussed on Thursday night, but for the most part, the candidates focused less on the qualifications of their rivals for the job than their records. 
 In one of his many challenges in the debate, Mr. Weprin took aim at Ms. Katz. ''How can you be independent of the real estate industry when your finance committee, which is on your Web site, is a who's who in the Real Estate Board of New York?'' he asked.
 Ms. Katz said she had maintained her independence, but Mr. Weprin kept at her.
 Ms. Katz said, ''You know, David, as chair of the finance committee, I know, looking through your contributions, that we probably don't want to have this discussion.''
 Replied Mr. Weprin: ''I'm willing to have the discussion.''
 He was not the only aggressor. At one point, Mr. Liu claimed that Mr. Yassky had flip-flopped on term limits. Mr. Yassky said he had been consistent.
 Some of the best information of the night came from the ''lightning round,'' a series of questions asked by Dominic Carter, the NY1 host, in which he demanded a yes or no answer from the candidates. Among the revelations: all the comptroller candidates have gambled at a casino; all but one, Ms. Katz, have bounced a check; and Mr. Yassky is apparently the biggest fan of Beyonce among them. 
 Asked if they had ever been audited by the I.R.S., Mr. Yassky said, ''I don't believe so, no.'' Only Mr. Weprin said he had.
 The candidates were evenly split on the question of whether Derek Jeter was the greatest Yankee ever; Ms. Katz threw her arms up at the question. 
 There was one question about Joseph A. Mendola, the Republican candidate in the race, and the only person running who is not on the City Council.
 Bob Hennelly of WNYC asked the candidates how they would respond to Mr. Mendola ''if he said being on the City Council is not a reference voters should use.'' But their answers veered toward their accomplishments on the Council. 
 The candidates gave mixed grades to the current comptroller, William C. Thompson Jr., when asked whether he should have detected City Council appropriations to organizations that did not exist. ''I think Bill could have done better,'' Mr. Liu said. 
 And they all sought to trumpet their independence from the mayor, citing stands they took on a variety of issues.
 Asked whether they were using the office as comptroller as a steppingstone to some higher office, they all answered no. ''I'm certainly not,'' Mr. Liu said.

HEADLINE: The Rally, 347 Points in 5 Days, Continues

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Investors pushed up stocks Thursday on Wall Street after a drop in weekly unemployment claims and an upbeat forecast from Procter & Gamble.
 The Dow Jones industrial average recorded its highest close since November. The index has risen 347 points in five days, its longest winning streak since last autumn.
 Gold prices, meanwhile, fell for the second straight day as optimism about the economy grew and investors funneled money into stocks and oil. 
 The drop in gold came as the dollar extended its slide to a new annual low against the euro. The euro rose 0.0043, to $1.4585, on Thursday as growing confidence about the global economy eased demand for the perceived safety of the dollar. 
 Gold for December delivery fell 30 cents to settle at $996.60 an ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange. On Tuesday, gold rose above $1,000 to its highest level since mid-March last year. As recently as Aug. 27, gold finished below $950.
 Crude oil prices rose 63 cents to settle at $71.94 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 The market gains have come even though analysts say that a retreat is overdue. The advance followed the Labor Department's report that jobless claims fell more than expected, to 550,000, last week. 
 Procter & Gamble's prediction that sales would rebound this autumn also improved the mood on Wall Street. The company's stock rose more than 4 percent.
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 80.26 points, or 0.8 percent, to 9,627.48. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 10.77 points, or 1 percent, to close at 1,044,14, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 23.63 points, or 1.1 percent, to 2084.02.
 Momentum grew in midafternoon as the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, told a Congressional panel that confidence and stability were returning to the economy after the panic that began a year ago.
 Investors voiced concerns about the pace of the gains, but few wanted to stand in the way of a market that was heading higher. The S.& P. 500 has risen 54.3 percent since hitting a 12-year low in March. It is sitting at an 11-month high, though it is still down 33.3 percent from its peak in October 2007.
 Ralph Fogel, co-chief investment officer at Fogel Neale Partners in New York, said that too many analysts were now expecting a pullback for it to actually happen. He pointed to a well-tested piece of Wall Street wisdom that if a certain prediction becomes too widely expected in the marketplace, the conclusion is often wrong.
 ''I'm not sure why this market is going to slow up so much,'' Mr. Fogel said. ''We look for a nice continued move upward.'' 
 In other corporate news Thursday, Corning and General Mills both provided improved earnings outlooks. Corning, a specialty glass maker, said it expected third-quarter sales volume to be higher than previously forecast. General Mills said its fiscal first-quarter earnings per share topped the food maker's expectations, helped by improved margins and growth of its food brands.
 Monsanto, the agriculture company, however, warned that its 2009 earnings would come in at the low end of its forecast and said it would cut more jobs than previously announced.
 The Treasury's 10-year note rose 1 2/32, to 102 11/32. The yield fell to 3.35 percent, from 3.47 percent late Wednesday.
 Following are the results of Thursday's Treasury auction of 30-year bonds:

HEADLINE: Report Sees Loss In Brooklyn Arena

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
The proposed basketball arena that has long been the centerpiece of the contentious Atlantic Yards development near Downtown Brooklyn would result in a net loss to the city of nearly $40 million over 30 years, according to a new report prepared by the city's Independent Budget Office. 
 The report stands in contrast to an earlier one, in 2005, by the same office, which concluded that the 18,000-seat arena would result in a net fiscal benefit for the city.
Since then, city subsidies for the project -- now estimated at $772 million -- have grown. So has uncertainty about the project, which would transform a 22-acre site that centers on a railyard owned by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
 The new report says, however, that the arena would result in a net gain to New York State of $25 million over 30 years, as well as $6 million in new tax revenues for the transportation authority.
 According to the report, the state would gain -- even as the city loses -- because it has put up less capital money for the project and because it could tax the personal incomes of the basketball players who would be working in New York instead of New Jersey, where the Nets are currently based.
 David Lombino, a spokesman for the city's Economic Development Corporation, said in a telephone interview, ''The report is sloppy and contains numerous inaccuracies.''
 He said it factored in costs associated with the entire project -- the arena and the mixed-use development around it -- while considering benefits only from the arena.
 ''In addition, our investment was based on benefits that aren't easily quantified, like job creation, affordable housing, school construction and open space -- and all of this on a site that is now an open railyard without any public benefit,'' Mr. Lombino said.

HEADLINE: A Fortress City That Didn't Come to Be: Fears of 9/12 Revisited

BYLINE: By N. R. KLEINFIELD

 BODY:
The day dawned different and stayed that way. Traffic was thin and sidewalks quiet. The stock exchange didn't open, nor the airports, the schools, Broadway. People loaded up on bottled water, batteries, canoes. The law enforcement presence was intense: men with machine guns, gunboats circling the harbor. 
 Downtown, fires burned, smoke plumed. The odor stood. 
 It was a city humbled and scared, where the possibilities of destruction had been recalibrated. It was Sept. 12, 2001. The day after. 
 So much has been said and written about what happened on 9/11. The following day is forgotten, just another dulled interlude in the aftermath of an incoherent morning.
 But New Yorkers were introduced that day to irreducible presumptions about their wounded city that many believed would harden and become chiseled into the event's enduring legacy.
 New York would become a fortress city, choked by apprehension and resignation, forever patrolled by soldiers and submarines. Another attack was coming. And soon.
 Tourists? Well, who would ever come again? Work in one of the city's skyscrapers? Not likely. The Fire Department, gutted by 343 deaths, could never recuperate. 
 If a crippled downtown Manhattan were to have any chance of regeneration, ground zero had to be rebuilt quickly, a bricks and mortar nose-thumbing to terror.
 Eight years later, those presumptions are cobwebbed memories that never came to pass. Indeed, glimpses into a few aspects of the city help measure the gap between what was predicted and what actually came to be. 
 You could start at one downtown street corner. The wisdom of the day after was that New York would never again bunch together important institutional nerve centers, binding them together in vulnerability.
 On Sept. 11, American Express had its headquarters at the southwest corner of West and Vesey Streets. It is still there. Since then, Verizon has settled its headquarters into the northeast corner. Goldman Sachs has assumed the northwest. All that's missing is the southeast corner. That will be filled by the tallest building in America.
 The Times Square Novelty Man
 David Cohen pointed out what the tourists like: replica taxicabs, ''I Love New York'' T-shirts and thimbles -- any gewgaw inscribed with New York. ''See this digital picture postcard?'' he said. ''Nice little item.''
 Mr. Cohen, 83, is the patriarch of Grand Slam, a family-run novelty and baseball clothing store on Broadway between 46th and 47th Streets, in the heart of Times Square. Eight years ago, he could not have imagined the heaving commerce, the new big buildings, and especially not the complacent scene outside his doors. People basked in the balmy weather at tables and chairs, under sheltering patio umbrellas, spread across Broadway. If they worried about anything, it was sunburn. 
 How about that? People, at the behest of the mayor himself, flocking to Times Square to relax!
 When fear engulfed the city on Sept. 12, many wrote off Times Square. Chemical bombs were sure to explode there. A suicide bomber strapped with explosives was destined to blow himself up at lunch hour. 
 ''It was creepy,'' Mr. Cohen said. ''It was, 'Oh my God, what's next?' I thought this would be the next hit.''
 Business was slow for months. Souvenirs didn't seem to mean the same anymore. ''Yeah, it took a dive,'' Mr. Cohen said. He shortened the store's hours. 
 But he did not leave. ''You can't live in fear,'' he said. ''Things happen and then they don't happen.''
 Now the weak economy squeezes sales, but pedestrian traffic in Times Square is far higher than it was before Sept. 11. Vastly enhanced security has been put in place, and even when incidents defy it, like the small bomb that exploded at the military recruiting station in March 2008, people shrug it off, keep coming. 
 ''This is the best spot in New York,'' Mr. Cohen said. ''Listen, the Square is the place.''
 The Garage Manager
 The fires wouldn't go out. The smell persisted. What company would ever open its doors in Lower Manhattan? Who would live there? Who could feel secure?
 The police stopped and searched trucks. Only a few cars were allowed below 14th Street.
 Still, Wilson Ortega, 34, came to work. He managed the parking garage at 56 North Moore Street in TriBeCa. 
 On Sept. 12, business was, as he put it, ''off 100 percent.'' But cars were still in there, and maybe people wanted them.
 As streets reopened, car pooling into Manhattan was mandated during rush hours. Bombs preyed on peoples' minds. Many garages throughout the city began checking trunks and jabbing mirrors on the ends of poles beneath cars. Some still do, but in large part the practices are additional relics of the times.
 ''Yeah, I checked,'' Mr. Ortega said. 
 Every trunk was searched. He acknowledged that he had no training in explosives, didn't know exactly what he was looking for, but he did every car for several months, then those he didn't recognize, the nonregulars, for nearly a year. Some people were insulted, wouldn't pop the trunk, and he turned them away. He never found a thing.
 The trade center site remains a conflicted construction project. But on North Moore it is cars in, cars out, just as before.
 ''I never thought things would be the same again,'' he said. ''But, man, I was wrong. We came back strong.'' 
 The Firefighter
 The number was 343. Back in those awful days, Chief Charlie Williams, 9th Battalion, Manhattan, thumbed down the death list looking for the firefighters he could have said hello to by name: ''Hi Tom, hi Joe, hi Ray.'' After about 40, he stopped. It was enough.
 The loss of life to the Fire Department was staggering. Many asked, who would put out the fires of tomorrow?
 In addition to the deaths, there was a stampede of retirements. The wives didn't want to join the widows. And the expansive opportunity for overtime pay afforded a tantalizing opportunity for firefighters to retire at bulgier pensions. 
 There were 11,339 uniformed members of the Fire Department on Sept. 10, 2001. By Jan. 28, 2003, the ranks had declined to 10,630.
 Chief Williams asked himself: ''Do I want to go back and do this job?'' His wife would have liked him to walk away. But he wasn't done. 
 Fresh recruits were rushed in. There was a long, difficult period. Even now, the experience level is not the same. But there are 11,415 uniformed personnel, more than before.
 ''The bell rings and the men put out the fires,'' Chief Williams said. ''The city is well served.''
 In the aftermath of Sept. 11, the firefighters were elevated to superhuman status. People flocked to the firehouses, wanting to shake hands with firefighters, snap their pictures, just say thanks. Chief Williams obliged, though he allowed how it got overbearing at times; he had to shut himself in his office to do his work.
 The bravery was always real. But the mythology -- well, that, too, wasn't going to last. In the ensuing years, there were embarrassing incidents: the firefighters who had sex with a woman at one Bronx firehouse, a drunken brawl at another in Staten Island, on-duty drinking and drug use. 
 ''The worship was definitely an inflated thing,'' Chief Williams said. ''You couldn't sustain that.'' 
 His own lungs went bad on him, traced back to the trade center, and he retired last year. He chose the date: Sept. 11.
 The Flag Printer
 People bought them from hardware stores and Wal-Mart and street vendors and unfurled them outside their homes and on the antennas of their cars. They billowed down the Henry Hudson and the F.D.R. 
 Flags.
 People wore their patriotism and defiance openly. A new cohesiveness, a oneness, was going to remold the character of American citizenry.
 Christopher Gravagna didn't feel right that people had to buy their patriotism. ''That was ridiculous,'' he said. ''Why should people capitalize on flags at that time?''
 He had a printing business in Long Island City, Queens, doing work for clubs and concerts. On Sept. 12, demand for his services essentially stopped and didn't resume for weeks. So he decided to print paper American flags with the motto ''United We Stand'' and give them away. He and his employees handed out more than 100,000. 
 He saw them everywhere.
 ''It helped feed this feeling that we have to be one, we have to be together on this,'' Mr. Gravagna said. ''We're a strong country. We're strong New Yorkers.''
 The flags -- cloth and paper -- are mostly gone. Some come out, as they always did, on Memorial Day, on the Fourth of July, and on Sept. 11, but that is it.
 That special mood? ''It's definitely diminished a lot,'' Mr. Gravagna said. ''Did I expect it? No. But as a New Yorker, I understand it. I guess part of it has to do with capitalism. In America, we have issues. And time passes. It just passes.''
 No one, perhaps, displayed as many flags as Mr. Gravagna himself. He taped them to the windows of his Queens apartment and in his Nissan Sentra. They festooned his offices.
 After a while, they came down. The last one he possessed he had framed. He hung it on his office wall. Four years ago, someone stole it. 
 The Skyscraper Dentist
 ''The windows here open,'' Dr. Charles Weiss said. 
 He unlatched one. The view south was dazzling, as only a 1,000-foot-high view can be. There was the Empire State Building and, way off, the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island, as well as a spot where two duplicate towers once stood. 
 On Sept. 12, it seemed no one would choose to work in a skyscraper again. Especially those with the emblematic names, the ones everyone knew about, high-rise terrorist bounty.
 Workers stuffed parachutes under their desks, were given particle masks, acquainted themselves with Geiger counters. 
 On Sept. 11, Dr. Weiss, a dentist, repaired teeth on the 69th floor of the Chrysler Building, at 42nd Street and Lexington Avenue. He still does.
 Capitulation was not his style. He recalled a book, ''The Last Angry Man,'' in which a pugnacious Brooklyn doctor refuses to yield to the bums he calls ''galoots.'' Dr. Weiss thought, as an assertion of faith, ''I'm not going to let the galoots get me.''
 On Sept. 12, the Chrysler Building was essentially closed, but he got in. He called patients to reschedule them. Some wanted some time before readdressing their cavities. He didn't see anyone until the following Monday. 
 As far as he knows, they all came back. The patients. The people who worked for him. His colleagues who minded the other dental chairs on the floor. 
 There are always some squeamish patients who fear heights. Dr. Weiss, now 82, dispatches a nurse down to the lobby to ride the elevator up with them. That happened before Sept. 11, too.
 Waiting patients now flipped through magazines as the drills sang.
 ''There's a tremendous drive of human beings to make the most of life,'' Dr. Weiss said. ''We're not hermits. We rise up and move on.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Trade Gap Swells On Rising Oil Imports

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
The gap between what the United States imports and what it exports is widening again. In July, rising oil imports pushed the trade deficit to its highest point since January, the government reported on Thursday. 
 The trade deficit swelled by a greater-than-expected $4.5 billion to a seasonally adjusted $32 billion in July, as imports grew at a faster clip than exports. It was the largest monthly increase in the trade gap in a decade.
 Still, economists greeted the latest figures from the Commerce Department as a sign that global trade was on the mend as countries around the world began recovering from the downturn. The gap had narrowed when the economy was contracting.
 ''The global economy is picking up at a pretty decent rate,'' said Brian A. Bethune, chief United States financial economist at IHS Global Insight. ''We have positive growth in exports, and we have positive growth in imports.''
 Trade between the United States and the rest of the world slowed sharply last year as the recession gained force, leaving container ships and tractor trailers idle and cutting traffic in some of the world's largest ports. But trade volumes are beginning to tick up again. For the month, imports rose by 4.7 percent while exports were 2.2 percent higher, their third consecutive month of gains. 
 ''It's not just a one-month phenomenon,'' Mr. Bethune said. ''That is a very good trend.''
 Auto companies exported $1.34 billion more vehicles, parts and engines to other countries, and exports of semiconductors, computers and computer accessories also grew. 
 Meanwhile, more auto parts flowed into the United States from places like Mexico and Canada as factories restarted their assembly plants, and crude oil imports jumped by $1.2 billion from a month earlier.
 While the trade deficit has ticked up for the last two months, economists said that higher rates of savings and more cautious spending by American consumers would limit the demand for foreign-made televisions, clothes and furniture. A reluctance -- or inability -- to spend could limit the growth of the trade gap, they said.
 Also on Thursday, the Labor Department said that first-time jobless claims fell by 26,000 last week, to a seasonally adjusted 550,000. The overall number of people receiving unemployment insurance fell by 159,000 for the week ending Aug. 29, to a total of just under 6.1 million.
 The figures provided another piece of evidence that job losses were abating little by little as the recession eased. But unemployment, which hit 9.7 percent in August, is still expected to top 10 percent next year.

HEADLINE: Winners and Losers One Year Later

BYLINE: By ROB COX

 BODY:
After the carnage that followed the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers a year ago, it would be easy to discard long-treasured investment theories like the efficient markets hypothesis as hock and soda water. If markets were remotely efficient, stock prices would have factored in the possibility of a collapse of the kind that followed the investment bank's failure. 
 Of course, they didn't -- and the rest is history. But in one respect the market does provide something approaching an efficient read on the state of the global financial industry 12 months on. Generally speaking, institutions fall into four broad categories: winners, survivors, the strategically challenged and those that exist today only through the grace of governments and taxpayers. 
 The market's verdict is clear on the winners. Goldman Sachs's share price has gained nearly 30 percent since Lehman went kaput. Shares in JPMorgan and Barclays are up about 15 percent. Santander and Credit Suisse follow, with gains of around 10 percent and 7 percent, respectively. 
 The victors share a few common attributes. They made relatively prudent decisions to limit risk before the credit bubble burst. This may reflect strong management -- in all these cases, the same executives are still in their jobs. Moreover, thanks to their prescience, natural conservatism or plain luck, they all found themselves in positions to prey upon the fallen to strengthen their own businesses.
 JPMorgan swooped in less than two weeks after Lehman's demise to acquire Washington Mutual. Morgan, led by Jamie Dimon, used its position as one of the few strong lenders to capture market share in corporate finance. Goldman did the same with its trading businesses, where revenues surged by 79 percent in the first half of this year compared with a year earlier. And prime brokerage and private banking clients switched to Credit Suisse from rivals, lured by the bank's solid financial footing.
 Barclays, meanwhile, acquired Lehman's North American businesses while avoiding the temptation to accept the British government's financing and its attached strings. Spain's Santander gained market share in Britain by acquiring the stricken Alliance & Leicester and Bradford & Bingley lenders. 
 Then there are the mere survivors: UBS, Deutsche Bank, Wells Fargo and Morgan Stanley are among them. Their business models were tested by the crisis. But all seem to be on the mend, in some cases because of large dollops of government intervention. Indeed, though their stock prices are all down, they have performed better than the S.& P. 500 index, which is down 12 percent.
 It wasn't easy. Morgan Stanley nearly went under last October as it pulled together a capital injection from Mitsubishi UFJ before the Treasury's Troubled Asset Relief Program became a bailout fund. It's now on firmer ground and even took control of the Smith Barney brokerage from Citigroup. But its returns look anemic.
 Wells Fargo snatched Wachovia away from Citigroup in a deal brokered by banking regulators. But the move weighed Wells down with a portfolio of troubled assets, including funky adjustable-rate mortgages in California. Deutsche jumped into subprime mortgage lending too late to be badly hit. But while Deutsche is far less exposed to ailing consumers, it must contend with a frail German economy.
 Behind the survivors come the strategically challenged. Squarely falling in this camp -- at least according to the stock market's read -- are Bank of America, which is down 35 percent, as well as General Electric and Lloyds Banking Group, both of whose stocks have lost nearly half their value. All three have valuable assets. But investors remain concerned about potential write-downs and capital needs. 
 That's particularly true of the Merrill Lynch and HBOS franchises that Bank of America and Lloyds, respectively, acquired. G.E. investors worry about the health of assets inside the company's $600 billion financial unit. Concerns like these overshadow the value of the good assets at all three companies. 
 The final group consists of those on life support. These are firms that have largely become wards of the state and have the share price performances to reflect it. American International Group, Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae and the wounded behemoths Royal Bank of Scotland and Citigroup have lost 60 percent to 80 percent in value. In all cases, total failure was averted by government intervention. Now, though, there is no certainty they will ever re-emerge as profitable world-class institutions.

HEADLINE: Chavez Backs Moscow on Rebel Regions

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SCHWIRTZ; Olesya Vartanyan contributed reporting from Tbilisi, Georgia.

DATELINE: MOSCOW 

 BODY:
President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela thrust himself into one of the most contentious disputes between Russia and the West on Thursday, announcing that his country would become the third to recognize the independence declared by two Russian-backed rebel regions of Georgia.
 Russia recognized the two republics, Abkhazia and South Ossetia, as independent a year ago, shortly after it fought a war against Georgia over the territories. Until Thursday, only Nicaragua had followed suit. 
 ''Venezuela is joining in recognition of the independence of the republics of Abkhazia and South Ossetia,'' Mr. Chavez said during a meeting with Russia's president, Dmitri A. Medvedev, at his residence outside Moscow. ''Starting today, we will recognize these republics,'' he said, through a Russian translator.
 The announcement drew an immediate response from Abkhazia's de facto president, Sergei Bagapsh, who thanked Mr. Chavez and pledged closer economic and political ties with Venezuela, Interfax reported. 
 Mr. Medvedev also offered his thanks. ''We are not indifferent to the fate of South Ossetia and Abkhazia; we were the first country to come to the rescue of these young regions,'' he said, in remarks on Russian television. ''We are glad that worldwide support for them is growing.''
 Moscow's decision to recognize the two regions and deploy hundreds of Russian troops in both after its brief war with Georgia last August drew widespread international condemnation. It also raised tensions with some other countries in the former Soviet sphere, who worried that the precedent could encourage separatist movements within their own borders.
 The issue has also ensured that tensions remain high between Russia and Georgia. Lately, the two have clashed over shipping rights to Abkhazia via the Black Sea. The Georgian coast guard has impounded five ships from different countries this year for delivering supplies to Abkhazia in violation of Georgian law.
 Georgia brushed aside Mr. Chavez's announcement on Thursday as insignificant. 
 ''It does not change the situation concerning these regions at all,'' said Alexander Nalbandov, Georgia's deputy foreign minister. ''Ninety-nine percent of the international community recognizes the territorial integrity of Georgia.''
 Mr. Chavez arrived in Moscow on Wednesday and, in usual form, delivered a speech at a local university railing against the United States. The Kremlin has typically tried to distance itself from Mr. Chavez's often flamboyant jingoism, but Russia has become one of Venezuela's key international partners.
 Mr. Chavez sees Moscow as possibly acting as a counterweight to Washington's influence in Latin America. He has visited Russia eight times as president, often seeking to procure Russian-made arms and weapons systems. Russia and Venezuela in recent years have signed agreements worth over $4 billion for deliveries of fighter jets, helicopters and automatic weapons. In a visit last year, Mr. Chavez signed an agreement for a $1 billion loan from Russia for weapons purchases and military development. 
 Russia was third last year in global weapons sales, recording $3.5 billion, just behind Italy, with $3.7 billion, according to a recently released Congressional study. The United States sells the most by far, with agreements valued at $37.8 billion in 2008, the study said. The study noted that China and India continue to be Russia's main weapons clients, but that Russia has a new focus on arms sales to Latin American nations, particularly Venezuela. 
 On Thursday, Mr. Medvedev reiterated Russia's commitment to supply Venezuela with an array of new weapons, adding that such sales would adhere to international law.
 ''We will supply Venezuela with all the weapons that they request,'' Mr. Medvedev said. ''We will supply tanks among the deliveries. Why not? We have good tanks. If our friends order them, we will deliver.''

HEADLINE: Successor To Mack Is Chosen At Morgan

BYLINE: By GRAHAM BOWLEY and LOUISE STORY

 BODY:
Cheers echoed through Morgan Stanley when John J. Mack returned to save the soul of the bank, the bluest of Wall Street's blue-bloods, in the summer of 2005. 
 Four years on, Mr. Mack -- his bank and reputation smarting from the financial crisis -- is bequeathing Morgan Stanley to a relative newcomer: James P. Gorman, the quiet power behind a new push to lure ordinary investors to the bank's blossoming brokerage business. 
 The appointment, announced on Thursday, ends months of speculation over who will succeed Mr. Mack as head of what was, until recently, one of the most prestigious and successful banks on Wall Street. Unanswered are the many questions still swirling over Mr. Mack's legacy -- and, now, over Mr. Gorman, his handpicked successor. 
 Mr. Gorman, 51, will become chief executive on Jan. 1; Mr. Mack, 64, will remain chairman. The handoff is far smoother than the one that occurred when Mr. Mack returned in triumph after a shocking boardroom coup.
 But the bitter, internal feud that opened the door for Mr. Mack was nothing compared to the turmoil that followed. Mr. Mack presided over an era of unprecedented profits -- and then record losses. Only a year ago, Morgan Stanley nearly foundered like Lehman Brothers. It was saved, like so much of Wall Street, by a multibillion-dollar bailout and other government aid. 
 Wall Street has rendered a harsh judgment on Mr. Mack's stewardship. On his watch, Morgan Stanley's share price lost nearly a third of its value, while the stock of its archrival, Goldman Sachs, has gained. After skating so close to the edge, Mr. Mack retreated from the high-risk businesses that almost cost him his bank. To many, Morgan Stanley seemed to lose its old swagger. 
 To Morgan Stanley insiders, the diminished role for Mr. Mack, who spent all but a few years of his career at the bank, is not only a changing of the guard but the end of an era. He and Mr. Gorman will hold a town hall-style meeting at Morgan Stanley's Manhattan headquarters on Friday. 
 ''It will be emotional,'' said one senior executive.
 Mr. Gorman will come to the job with a far different pedigree than Mr. Mack. A lanky, cerebral Australian-born executive who dislikes being called Jim, Mr. Gorman is currently co-president in charge of Morgan Stanley's global wealth management. He joined Morgan Stanley less than four years ago, from Merrill Lynch, where he ran the global private client business. Before that he was a senior partner at McKinsey & Company. 
 For much of the last year, Mr. Gorman and another executive, Walid A. Chammah, who runs the investment banking and capital markets operations, had been vying for the top job. Mr. Mack seemed to have favored Mr. Gorman, whom he had hired and promoted through the ranks. 
 Mr. Chammah, a flamboyant man with a penchant for smart suits and monogrammed shirts, also ruled himself out by insisting on staying in London, where he lives in South Kensington. He will become chairman of Morgan Stanley International.
 After a dismal second quarter because of problems in Mr. Chammah's half of the bank, the scale tipped decisively in Mr. Gorman's favor. While questions remained over Mr. Mack's charismatic but sometimes unstructured management style, the board had been impressed by Mr. Gorman's ability to switch quickly between jobs and learn fast, important in a vast conglomerate like Morgan, and especially appreciated his presentations to the board on the long-term future of the firm.
 For Mr. Gorman, the good news came Monday evening, over dinner and drinks with Mr. Mack at Ilili, an upscale Lebanese restaurant in the Flatiron district in Manhattan (Mr. Mack is of Lebanese descent). After a 10 a.m. conference call on Thursday with board members, the deal was done. The vote for Mr. Gorman was unanimous. 
 In an interview on Thursday, Mr. Mack characterized the succession as orderly. He said the process of finding a successor had been under way for about 18 months when he first told the board he wanted to step down when his contract ended next year and before he turned 65. He will turn 65 in November. The bank hired a recruiter to draw up a list of outside candidates, but none of them were interviewed.
 Still, Mr. Mack and other executives said he had faced resistance to his decision to step down, describing a conversation with S. Parker Gilbert, former chairman and a man who represents old school Morgan Stanley. He had been one of the so-called Group of Eight who had agitated to oust Mr. Mack's predecessor, Philip J. Purcell, and brought Mr. Mack back to the firm.
 ''I want you to stay longer,'' Mr. Parker said. ''I am confident you can enjoy the fruits of your work.'' But Mr. Mack answered: ''Parker, after getting through the financial crisis and the way this firm was pushed around financially and the fear'' of going under, he said he had decided he wanted to go.
 Mr. Mack will most likely remain a force behind Mr. Gorman. The two men will still have offices next to each other. Mr. Gorman, for his part, said Mr. Mack's legacy was secure. ''John came back and stabilized the company and brought back the pride,'' he said. ''He made the right calls at the right time in an incredibly stressful situation,'' he said. 
 While Mr. Gorman lacks Mr. Mack's flash and is far less known in financial circles, people who know him said he was up to the job. 
 R. Glenn Hubbard, dean of Columbia Business School, who has known Mr. Gorman since his days at Merrill Lynch, said he was a ''strategic thinker'' and his qualities made him ''a good recipe for success.'' He described Mr. Gorman as a ''terrific pick.'' Mr. Gorman sits on the school's board. 

CORRECTION-DATE: September 14, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An article on Friday about the naming of a successor to John J. Mack as chief executive of Morgan Stanley misstated on second reference the surname of S. Parker Gilbert, a former Morgan chairman who sought to persuade Mr. Mack to stay longer at the bank. He is Mr. Gilbert, not Mr. Parker.

HEADLINE: Bailout Set To Ride Off Into Sunset

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
One year after the federal government began the biggest financial bailout in history, President Obama's top economic advisers say the banking system has regained enough health to begin removing the government's backstops.
 ''We must begin winding down some of the extraordinary support we put in place for the financial system,'' the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, told the Congressional panel that oversees the $700 billion rescue program.
 Citing a steady revival in financial markets and in the economy, Mr. Geithner said banks and corporations were increasingly able to raise capital from private investors and were relying less heavily on the government's special loan and guarantee programs. 
 Treasury officials said they expected banks and other financial institutions to repay an additional $50 billion that they borrowed from the government, on top of $70 billion already repaid, over the next 12 to 18 months.
 Mr. Obama will travel to Wall Street on Monday to deliver what the White House is billing as a major speech on the financial crisis. The address, at Federal Hall, will come one year after the collapse of the investment giant Lehman Brothers. 
 White House budget officials have already scaled back estimates of how much money they might need to keep the financial system afloat. The White House had originally left room in its budget proposal for as much as $750 billion in additional aid to the banking system. Officials dropped that placeholder last month, saying that that the improved financial conditions allowed them to manage with the original $700 billion that Congress authorized last year.
 Beyond that, officials said they were already starting to phase out some of their emergency credit programs. 
 The Treasury's loan program for money market mutual funds will come to an end on Sept. 18. Officials said the program had not lost any money and had earned about $1.2 billion in fees.
 The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's program to guarantee bonds sold by financial institutions, which is providing more than $300 billion in ''temporary liquidity guarantees,'' will either stop making new guarantees at the end of October or reduce the volume to a tiny fraction of earlier levels.
 And while Treasury officials push ahead with part of the ''Public Private Investment Partnerships,'' which are expected to start buying up toxic assets from banks in October, that program will be much smaller than originally expected.
 ''The consensus among private forecasters is that our economy is now growing; the financial system is showing signs of repair; and the cost of credit has fallen dramatically,'' Mr. Geithner said. ''It is clear we have stepped back from the brink.''
 Mr. Geithner cautioned that the economy remained weak, and warned that it would be a mistake to shut all the emergency programs too quickly. They predicted that unemployment -- already 9.7 percent, higher than at any time since the early 1980s -- will probably peak above 10 percent before it begins to edge down slowly next year.
 Even though Treasury and Fed officials are starting to wind down some of their support programs, President Obama's $787 billion economic stimulus program is only beginning.
 The White House Council of Economic Advisers estimated on Thursday that the government used up only $151 billion, or about one-fifth, of the stimulus money through the end of August.
 Even so, the council estimated that the stimulus program raised output by 2.3 percentage points in the second quarter and saved or created 600,000 to 1.1 million jobs by the end of August.
 ''The trajectory of the economy changed materially toward moderating output decline and job loss,'' the council said in its report. The White House estimates are in line with those of many private forecasters, who predict that the economy will expand at an annualized pace of 3 percent in second half of 2009 after having contracted sharply in the first half of the year. 
 Republican leaders blasted the administration's assessments. ''The president's economic stimulus experiment clearly isn't working as promised,'' said Michael Steele, chairman of the Republican National Committee, in a statement.
 The maze of the government's rescue programs will take years to unwind. The Treasury, the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation have guaranteed trillions of dollars worth of bank deposits, bonds, mortgages and short-term commercial debt over the last year. 
 The most visible of those efforts, the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program, has directly invested hundreds of billions of dollars in banks, Wall Street firms and car companies. It has invested $239 billion in banks and other financial institutions since its creation, administration officials said, though repayments by almost three dozen banks have reduced that amount to $168 billion. It has also invested about $80 billion in rescue efforts for General Motors, Chrysler and automobile suppliers, and it has contributed tens of billions to the bailout of the American International Group, the insurance conglomerate. It is also used to subsidize loan modifications for troubled homeowners. . 
 Treasury officials acknowledged that it would take years for the government to get its money back from the car companies, A.I.G., or many of the more troubled banks they have helped.

HEADLINE: Automatic Cuts Could Help Push Past a Health Hurdle

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama's new call to impose automatic spending cuts if the health care overhaul adds ''one dime'' to federal budget deficits could help push his top domestic priority over one of the biggest hurdles in its path through Congress.
 But once in law, such automatic triggers have not proved effective as a way to reduce federal spending. In the past, Congress and the White House have simply overridden or ignored them. This time, advocates insist, would be different. 
 In his prime-time address on Wednesday to a joint session of Congress, Mr. Obama restated his only line in the sand for a health care bill: He will not sign any measure that ''adds one dime to the deficit, now or in the future, period.'' But for the first time he asked Congress to mandate that future Congresses and presidents ''come forward with more spending cuts if the savings we promised don't materialize.'' 
 While the White House does not have a specific method in mind, health economists have suggested that one such trigger could be a limit on Medicare payments to doctors and hospitals. 
 With such a requirement written into legislation, precedents suggest that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office would be likely to conclude that the bill would not add to annual deficits, despite the poor track record for triggers.
 And a finding of deficit neutrality from the budget office, which ''scores'' costs and savings over a 10-year period, is crucial to passing a health care bill.
 Already the budget office's analyses of overhaul bills adopted by several House and Senate committees, which found that the measures would add to federal deficits, have stymied the bills' progress. And the budget office's preliminary findings about the still-unfinished work of the fifth and last Congressional panel necessary to act, the Senate Finance Committee, has contributed to a summer of delays there.
 But a deficit trigger like Mr. Obama now proposes ultimately could bridge a fiscal gap.
 In his speech on Wednesday, Mr. Obama stipulated that the total cost of the health care initiative should be about $900 billion. Much of it would be due to expanding Medicaid to more poor individuals and providing subsidies and tax credits to help low-income people and small businesses buy coverage through new insurance ''exchanges.''
 Mr. Obama this year proposed over $900 billion in savings to offset the costs. About two-thirds would come from reduced Medicare payments to hospitals, drug makers and insurance companies, some of which the industries have tentatively agreed to. The rest would come from higher revenues, mostly from limiting deductions of the richest taxpayers, but Congressional leaders quickly rejected that idea.
 The president has insisted on offsetting the costs of a health bill in ways that the budget office will credit, in contrast with Republicans' failure in the Bush administration to pay for a new Medicare prescription drug benefit that will add more than $800 billion to the debt by 2019. Yet he has argued that his proposed overhaul would result in even bigger savings from greater productivity in the health industry.
 The trouble for Mr. Obama is that such savings cannot be scored by the Congressional Budget Office. Even if they could be counted, most would not be likely to emerge within the budget office's 10-year time frame.
 The beauty of a trigger, according to administration officials and its supporters, is two-fold: Initially it would help secure the budget office's fiscal blessing. Once in law, the trigger would never be pulled because big savings eventually would be realized.
 The trigger ''will not be needed,'' predicted David M. Cutler, a Harvard professor who proposed the idea in a paper last June with Judy Feder, a professor at the Georgetown Public Policy Institute.
 Representative Jim Cooper of Tennessee, a conservative Democrat who teaches health care policy at Vanderbilt University, cited estimates that the nation's health care system wastes over $700 billion a year. ''If we only capture 10 to 15 percent of that we can pay for most or all of the bill,'' he said. 
 Others remain skeptical, citing for example Congress's annual routine of blocking cuts in Medicare payments to doctors that otherwise would occur under a law intended to restrain Medicare spending.
 ''We've been burned on triggers before: they get ignored, waived, and sometimes eliminated altogether,'' said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, which is supported by business. ''We need to develop a serious and reliable trigger that politicians are actually willing to abide by.''

HEADLINE: Nations Remain Divided on Global Warming Policy, U.S. Negotiator Says

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Obama administration's senior negotiator on global warming warned Thursday that developed and developing nations remained deeply divided in talks on reducing greenhouse gases and that time was running out before United Nations treaty negotiations in December. 
 The negotiator, Todd Stern, the State Department special envoy on the issue, told a Congressional panel that it was critical that Congress act on proposed energy and global warming legislation to demonstrate the nation's willingness to play its part in reducing harmful emissions.
 ''Let me say bluntly that the tenor of negotiations in the formal U.N. track has been difficult,'' Mr. Stern told the House Select Committee for Energy Independence and Global Warming. ''Developing countries tend to see a problem not of their own making that they are being asked to fix in ways which, they fear, could stifle their ability to lift their standards of living.'' 
 ''Developed countries,'' he said, ''tend to see an unforgiving problem with potentially grave and irreversible consequences and that cannot be solved without the full participation of developing countries, particularly China and the other emerging market economies.''
 Mr. Stern said China, India, Brazil and other rapidly industrializing countries were taking significant unilateral steps to slow the growth of emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases that contribute to the warming of the planet. He said their efforts in some cases outstripped those of the United States and some other advanced economies.
 Still, officials from those countries are wary of any treaty that binds them to enforceable targets, believing that such measures could permanently condemn them to second-class economic status.
 ''I have said on occasion that countries like these are often willing to do more than they are willing to agree to do,'' Mr. Stern said. ''But we can't get an international deal done unless they are willing to agree in an international context.''
 He said the United States could also pose a major hurdle to the global talks to produce a treaty to succeed the Kyoto Protocol, a 1997 accord that expires in 2012. 
 While the House approved a fairly aggressive climate and energy bill in June, action in the Senate this fall is uncertain at best. 
 ''It is critical that the Senate now do its part to move this process forward in a timely manner,'' Mr. Stern said. ''Nothing the United States can do is more important for the international negotiation process than passing robust, comprehensive clean energy legislation as soon as possible.''
 Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts and the chairman of the select committee, is a co-sponsor of the House climate bill. Mr. Markey said that House passage of the bill had helped prompt the Group of 8 leading industrialized nations to agree to try to limit the global rise in temperature to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) and that Senate action could help spur agreement at the December treaty talks in Denmark.
 ''With a few months left before climate negotiations in Copenhagen,'' Mr. Markey said, ''it's now time for the Senate to act and pass a bill so America will have the stature to craft a global climate agreement.''

HEADLINE: Reviews of Obama's Speech on Health

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Obama, Armed With Details, Challenges Congress'' (front page, Sept. 10): 
 On Wednesday night our president did a magnificent job of explaining his vision for health care reform. The economic and moral urgency is clear. He provided enough details on coverage and how to pay for the changes. I am glad that he continued to support a public option.
 We are blessed with a president with the intellect, values, generosity of spirit and toughness to get the job done. Now let's see if the Republicans can set aside scare tactics and work in good faith with the president. With or without them, we have to get this done.
 Eleanor Shaw-Belblidia Gaithersburg, Md., Sept. 10, 2009 
 To the Editor:
 Your article about President Obama's speech to Congress on health care reform states that he addressed a ''skeptical nation.'' I'm one of those skeptics, but I'm not skeptical about the president or his hopes and dreams for my country. I'm skeptical about those in Congress and the media who see no room for discussion on solving our health care problems.
 Their focus is on blocking any program or policy by the current administration, trying to make themselves look good by making Mr. Obama look bad. Veracity doesn't play a major part in their tactics, and they build themselves up on the fears of the people.
 I urge our senators and representatives to do the right thing and work with the Obama administration to give us the health care we desperately need in this country. I'm skeptical, however, about how many will heed the call.
 Linda Kocher New Orleans, Sept. 10, 2009
 To the Editor:
 It is still a source of astonishment that in one of the richest countries in the world, tens of millions risk bankruptcy if they get sick and an estimated 18,000 deaths each year are linked to lack of health insurance. Most unbelievable of all, there are politicians who would kill reform outright rather than seeking common ground on a solution.
 Congress's mission should be to prove to the world that we can do better than that.

 To the Editor:
 As retired teachers who maintain a strong interest in the development and education of children, we find the boos and ''You lie!'' coming from the mouths of certain members of Congress an embarrassment to the nation.
 When government officials act like unruly children in public, we wonder what the nation's children think. Where are the mature, respectful role models children so desperately need and deserve?
 Mel Minthorn Gail Minthorn Wilton, Conn., Sept. 10, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Although Representative Joe Wilson's ''You lie!'' comment was inappropriate for the setting, it is wrong to portray Republican and conservative protesters at recent town hall meetings as out of line.
 Activists from the left are just as shrill, just as organized and far more common than those on the right. Conservatives from Middle America rarely protest, while liberals from college campuses and Hollywood are always agitating.
 In the last decade alone, the left has demonized George W. Bush, Dick Cheney and other Republican leaders as liars, incompetent and/or evil, and the mainstream press has accepted and amplified such rhetoric without batting an eye. What goes around comes around.
 Mark R. Godburn North Canaan, Conn., Sept. 10, 2009
 To the Editor:
 It would have been audacious but, nevertheless, a teaching moment had President Obama called Representative Joe Wilson, who heckled him during his address to Congress, to the well, like a teacher calling an errant child to the front of the class, asked him his name, asked him what state he came from, asked him to repeat his remark, asked him to explain why he called him a liar, straightened him out, then told him to sit down.
 Richard Rosenthal New York, Sept. 10, 2009
 To the Editor:
 To achieve President Obama's laudable goal of universal health care coverage, requiring health insurers to enroll those with pre-existing conditions will not be enough. Health insurers have every incentive to avoid high-risk individuals by other means, like offering high-deductible health plans, charging excessive premiums to less healthy individuals, and advertising and marketing in magazines and Web sites read by a younger, healthier population.
 The government instead should reverse all risk-avoidance insurer incentives by a government-supervised redistribution of insurance revenues from insurers that enroll a low-risk, younger population to those insurers that have enrolled a high-risk, older population, as is done in the Netherlands.
 Warren Greenberg Washington, Sept. 10, 2009
 The writer is professor emeritus, health policy, George Washington University.
 To the Editor:
 President Obama humanized the health care issue. He brilliantly invoked the memory of Edward M. Kennedy not as a politician, but as a father of two children who had cancer.
 By broadening the perspective of the debate, President Obama was able to avoid the propagation of partisanship, refocus the discussion on the basic morality of the matter and appeal to the common humanity of his audience.
 Geoff Rubin New York, Sept. 10, 2009
 The writer is a medical student.
 To the Editor:
 I applaud President Obama for trying to reform the American health care system. It is appalling that health care is a privilege and not a right in such a rich nation. 
 I am an American-born surgeon working in Africa for the humanitarian organization Doctors Without Borders. I recently received a diagnosis of probable recurrent cancer, but I am no longer insured in the United States so I cannot return home for treatment.
 I have been employed my entire adult life and spent most of it providing health care to American citizens. My European colleagues are shocked that I am from a nation that would not guarantee health care for its own people.
 It is a fallacy for wealthy and employed Americans to believe that providing health care to the uninsured is ''not my problem.'' As a nation we need to overcome our partisanship to ensure health care coverage for all.
 Bravo Obama!
 Kathryn M. Chu Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso Sept. 10, 2009
 To the Editor:
 As President Obama laid out the essentials of his plans for meaningful health care reform Wednesday night, he reinvigorated the health of his presidency, which seemed to be ailing in the dog days of summer.
 As someone who constantly worries about a lack of health coverage, I hope reforms are put in place as quickly as possible, so I don't die before I get old.

HEADLINE: Buy a G.M., Like It, or Get Your Money Back

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
Can a straight-talking Texan and a money-back guarantee persuade American consumers to buy a car from General Motors?
 In its first major marketing campaign since emerging from bankruptcy, G.M. is putting its new chairman, Edward E. Whitacre Jr., in the spotlight as the spokesman for its offer to give customers a full refund within 60 days on any G.M. car or truck.
 The campaign, called ''May the Best Car Win,'' is part of G.M.'s effort to change its lingering image as a financially struggling company with substandard products. The first television ads will begin Sunday, featuring Mr. Whitacre, the 67-year-old former AT&T chief who was recruited by the federal government to lead G.M.'s reconstituted board. 
 Mr. Whitacre, with his Texas drawl and folksy manner, dismissed comparisons to Lee Iacocca in an interview, though he said he hoped to restore confidence in G.M. just as Mr. Iacocca did with his ads for Chrysler in the 1980s.
 ''I'm happy to do it, I wanted to do it, and I think it is important to do it,'' Mr. Whitacre said in an interview. ''I am convinced that our cars are as good, if not better, than anybody else's.''
 He joked that he did not expect to become as famous as Mr. Iacocca, but he did say G.M. needed to repair its image.
 ''People are going to like this guarantee,'' he said. ''We're putting a lot on the line here, but I think that these risks are necessary.''
 In the ads, Mr. Whitacre does not mention the $50 billion that American taxpayers provided to bail out G.M., or the fact that the federal government holds a 60 percent ownership stake in the company. Mr. Whitacre is filmed walking through G.M.'s design studios in Warren, Mich., and sharing his own skepticism about the company before he came out of retirement in July.
 ''Before I started this job, I admit, I had some doubts -- probably a lot like you,'' he says to the camera. ''But I like what I found. I think you will too.''
 Other automakers, such as Hyundai, have offered to take cars back if buyer lose their jobs, or to replace a lemon with a new vehicle.
 But the G.M. program, which goes into effect Monday, simply guarantees product satisfaction or your money back.
 ''It's a pretty powerful statement of confidence in our products,'' said Fritz Henderson, G.M.'s chief executive. ''It's really all about getting people to consider our brands and our vehicles.''
 G.M.'s sales in the United States have fallen 35 percent this year, and its market share has dropped to a record low of about 19 percent.
 Mr. Whitacre has vowed that G.M. must stem the slide and begin increasing its sales. But he said it wasn't until he and other new board members actually drove the automaker's newest products that they felt G.M. had a lineup worthy of a money-back guarantee.
 ''The board was like a lot of Americans in that they didn't know how competitive we are on fuel economy and other attributes,'' said Bob Lutz, G.M.'s veteran car czar, who recently took charge of its marketing and advertising.
 Mr. Lutz and Mr. Henderson first discussed the idea last month, over lunch, of having Mr. Whitacre represent G.M. in its new ad campaign.
 ''Neither Fritz or I would be good in that role because we're tainted,'' Mr. Lutz said. ''We're part of the gang that took G.M. through Chapter 11. But Ed is definitely not one of the Detroit insiders.''
 Mr. Whitacre said he wasn't sure he wanted the attention the ads would bring. ''I was a little taken aback at first, because that's not exactly my bag,'' he said.
 But he realized that standing up for G.M. on camera could send a powerful message to consumers who might be on the fence about considering its products.
 ''I just know if you get into one of our cars, you're going to like what you see,'' Mr. Whitacre says in the ads. ''So we're putting our money where our mouth is.''
 While Mr. Iacocca became a legendary figure in automotive history partly because of the success of his ads, other auto executives have not fared as well in TV ads.
 Three years ago, a Chrysler campaign featuring Dieter Zetsche, the head of DaimlerChrysler, fell flat when consumers were confused by who exactly ''Dr. Z'' was.
 The TV spots featuring Mr. Whitacre will be phased out rather quickly, with more emphasis directed to the money-back guarantee and G.M.'s core brands -- Chevrolet, Cadillac, Buick and GMC.
 Mr. Lutz said the company had no way of knowing how many consumers would return cars after buying them. There are restrictions to prevent fraud in the program, including a requirement that customers make regular payments on the vehicle to qualify for a refund.
 Analysts saw little downside to the campaign. ''The risk that G.M. has in buyers returning its vehicles is very minimal,'' said Jeremy Anwyl, chief executive of the auto research Web site Edmunds.com.
 G.M. expects to continue the money-back guarantee at least through November and possibly longer. The marketing campaign will also include head-to-head comparisons between G.M. vehicles and competing models from Toyota, Ford and other companies.
 Mr. Whitacre declined to put a price tag on the overall campaign, although he acknowledged that it was more expensive than other, less ambitious options.
 ''But if it can generate sales, which we certainly think it will, that will result in us being able to pay back the American taxpayer quicker,'' he said.

HEADLINE: A Clear Responsibility

 BODY:
In the moving peroration of his speech to Congress Wednesday night, President Obama cast health care reform as a moral issue that reflects on the character of our country. He also made clear that there are some problems that are too big for individuals to solve on their own -- and that guaranteeing that all Americans have access to health care is one of them. 
 ''Our predecessors understood that government could not, and should not, solve every problem,'' he said. ''But they also understood that the danger of too much government is matched by the perils of too little.'' 
 Any critic who still questions the need for health care reform or rails against a ''government takeover'' of health care should look at the latest Census Bureau estimates of the number of people without health insurance in this country -- and the number who have avoided disaster precisely because of government help. 
 The overall number of the uninsured rose from 45.7 million in 2007 to 46.3 million in 2008. The fact that tens of millions of Americans may be one major illness away from bankruptcy is unacceptable. But there is also some heartening news: The increase was relatively small considering the depth of the economic crisis. That is only because government programs helped offset the decline of private insurance and employer-based coverage.
 An aging population made more people eligible for Medicare, that much-maligned ''single-payer'' government program that provides coverage to almost all of the nation's elderly, usually to their deep satisfaction. And deepening poverty rates made more people eligible for Medicaid, a joint federal-state program to cover the poor.
 A strong push to enroll children in either Medicaid or S-chip, the state health insurance program for children from low-income families, has driven the number and rate of uninsured children to its lowest levels since 1987, the first year comparable data were collected. This is a stunning achievement -- courtesy of your federal and state governments. 
 The most worrisome trend is that the number of adults under age 65 who lack insurance is high and rising, reaching 20 percent of that age group last year. The number of uninsured adults increased by 1.5 million in 2008. The toll in 2009 is likely to be worse as unemployment rates continue to rise, depriving workers of their group coverage, and more companies drop or shrink health benefits. 
 The health care reform plan that President Obama and many Democrats in Congress are calling for could do a lot to reduce Americans' vulnerability and stem that tide. Likely reforms would require employers to provide health benefits to their workers or pay a fee to help cover them elsewhere, thus slowing the erosion of employer coverage. Reform would also expand Medicaid to cover more poor people, create exchanges where people without group coverage at work could buy affordable policies and receive subsidies based on their incomes and prohibit insurance companies from denying coverage or charging exorbitant rates based on medical conditions. 
 Critics of health care reform have done Americans two great disservices. They have obscured and denied the very real suffering of tens of millions of uninsured Americans and the very real danger that millions more could soon join them. And they have twisted and denied the goal of health care reform when they rail against a fictitious government takeover. 
 As Mr. Obama said in his speech, when facts, reason and civility are thrown overboard, he said, ''we don't merely lose our capacity to solve big challenges. We lose something essential about ourselves.''
 This editorial is a part of an ongoing series by The Times that is providing a comprehensive examination of the policy challenges and politics behind the debate over health care reform. Read all of these articles.

HEADLINE: Obama Is Being Recruited By Chicago Olympic Group

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER; Juliet Macur contributed reporting from Chicago.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
He is fighting two wars, trying to tame a recession and seeking to remake one-sixth of the American economy by overhauling health care. But President Obama is also the world's best-known Chicagoan. So should he leave his day duties to fly to Denmark to help his adopted hometown win the right to host the Olympics?
 Chicago thinks so, or at least some of the city's leadership does. In the waning days of its bid for the Summer Olympics of 2016, the city is pressuring its favorite son to put it over the top by making an appearance at the International Olympic Committee meeting in Copenhagen next month. It does not hurt that one of the city's top boosters is Valerie Jarrett, the president's close friend and White House adviser. 
 Aides said Thursday that no final decision had been made, but that they doubted Obama would make the trip. It is no easy choice. If he does not go, he risks the consternation of his political ally Mayor Richard M. Daley. If he does go and Chicago loses, he could be embarrassed by not bringing home the gold. Even if he were to help Chicago win, he might still be criticized for devoting time to such a venture at a moment of great national challenges.
 Since 2005, when Tony Blair, Britain's prime minister at the time, went to Singapore to lobby successfully for London's bid to host the 2012 Games, it has become more common for national leaders to personally attend. In 2007, Vladimir Putin, then Russia's president, followed suit by going to Guatemala, where he won the right to host the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi.
 This year, the heads of state representing Chicago's three rivals -- Rio de Janeiro, Madrid and Tokyo -- are expected to go to Copenhagen for the Oct. 2 vote by the I.O.C. Chicago, once viewed as the frontrunner, now appears to be lagging, according to Olympics watchers, and Obama could be the deciding factor.
 ''Bringing Obama with the bid team would obviously have a positive impact,'' said Ric Munoz, a Chicago alderman. ''President Obama being as well liked as he is, it's kind of like bringing Michael Jordan or Oprah Winfrey. It's that star power.''
 Larry Probst, the United States Olympic Committee chairman, said Thursday that his organization had been in touch with the White House through ''letters and multiple phone calls'' regarding Obama's potential trip.
 ''I think we have all very clearly communicated to the White House that we think President Obama's presence will greatly assist the bid,'' Probst said at a meeting of Olympic athletes in Chicago.
 The catch is that the results of this presidential trip, unlike many others, cannot be negotiated in advance. 
 ''You don't know what the vote is going to be and it's not predictable,'' said Kevin Sullivan, a White House aide to former President George W. Bush, who now provides strategic communications advice to sports teams. ''But I don't think it would reflect unfavorably on the White House if the president went and it went to one of the other cities.''
 Critics, though, said Obama should not waste precious time, especially while facing critical decisions on issues like health care and the war in Afghanistan. ''There's many other things at home he should be concentrating on instead of getting Chicago the Olympics,'' said Bob Quellos, co-founder of No Games Chicago, a group opposing the city's bid.
 Obama has taped four video messages for the city, will host Olympic athletes at the White House next week and created a White House office on the Olympics overseen by Jarrett, his senior adviser, who was vice chairwoman of the Chicago 2016 bid group. The White House has said that she will go to Copenhagen for the meeting.

HEADLINE: Obama Keeps Up Health Care Push, Citing Uninsured

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG and JEFF ZELENY; David Stout contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama, seeking to buttress his case for the kind of comprehensive health care overhaul that has eluded Washington for decades, said Thursday that the number of uninsured Americans rose by nearly 6 million as the recession intensified during the last 12 months.
 On the morning after his blunt address on health care to a joint session of Congress, Mr. Obama addressed a group of nurses on the White House campus -- and received the endorsement of their professional association, administration officials said. He used his brief appearance to reinforce Wednesday night's message that his plan will bring ''security and stability'' to those who have insurance, and coverage to those who do not.
 ''Now is the time to act,'' Mr. Obama said, ''and I will not permit reform to be postponed or imperiled by the usual ideological diversions.'' The president drew applause from the nurses, in sharp contrast to the cool, even hostile, reactions from Republicans to his Wednesday night address. 
 The White House is in what Obama aides regard as the final, crucial phase of the health care debate, in which the president will move aggressively to try to close the deal with lawmakers and the American public. While Democratic leaders acknowledged that the speech probably did not guarantee any new support, Mr. Obama nonetheless invited a group of centrist Democrats -- essential to passing the legislation -- to meet with him at the White House on Thursday afternoon. 
 And if Mr. Obama picked up any Republican supporters beyond perhaps Senator Olympia Snowe of Maine, they were invisible and silent on Thursday. 
 ''I must say I've never heard a more partisan speech by a president in that House chamber, and I've listened to five presidents now as a member of the House and the Senate,'' said Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona, the Republican whip. 
 Recalling Mr. Obama's statement that he would not ''waste time with those who have made the calculation that it's better politics to kill this plan than to improve it,'' Mr. Kyl asked, ''How about those of us who simply have legitimate differences of opinion with him?''
 Mr. Kyl's Arizona colleague, Senator John McCain, said of Mr. Obama speech, ''The math doesn't add up and the record doesn't add up.''
 ''There is very little if anything in this package that calls for real spending reduction, and $1 trillion is basically what it's going to cost,'' Mr. McCain said on NBC's ''Today'' show.
 House Republican leaders were also cool. Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the minority leader, said several of the president's statements were debatable, including Mr. Obama's insistence that his outline for change would not run up the deficit and would not lead to too much government involvement.
 ''We appreciated having the president here last night,'' Mr. Boehner said. ''Unfortunately, what the American people got wasn't a new health care plan. It was just another lecture.''
 And Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the House minority whip, said it was less important to enact health care change quickly than it was ''we get it done right.''
 ''There are many things we can work together on,'' he said.
 On Saturday, the president will return to his bully pulpit, with a campaign-style rally in Minneapolis.
 ''Most Americans do have insurance and have never had less security and stability than they do right now,'' Mr. Obama told the nurses, ''because they're subject to the whims of health insurance companies.''
 The White House said Mr. Obama's assertion that there are 6 million more unemployed Americans came from a new Gallup Survey that tracked changes in the number of uninsured between September 2008 and today. 
 The president also took the opportunity on Thursday to again denounce those who he said have been guilty of exaggerations, or outright untruths, through ''chatter and the noise on radio and TV.''
 But it was an outburst by Representative Joe Wilson, a South Carolina Republican, on Wednesday night during the president's address that was still a hot topic at the Capitol on Thursday. 
 ''You lie!'' Mr. Wilson shouted as Mr. Obama said illegal immigrants would not be covered by any of the proposals making their way through Congress. Mr. Wilson apologized for his outburst, and the president said on Thursday that he had accepted Mr. Wilson's expression of contrition. 
 ''We all make mistakes,'' Mr. Obama said.
 Mr. Boehner said Mr. Wilson's behavior had been ''inappropriate,'' and that he was glad Mr. Wilson apologized. 
 Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Senate Republican leader, agreed. ''I think we ought to treat the president with respect,'' he said, adding that anything else is inappropriate.
 Mr. Wilson's outburst also created trouble for Representative Charlie Wilson, an Ohio Democrat, who said on Thursday that he had received messages mistakenly criticizing him for attacking the president. The Wilsons are not related.
 Mr. Obama vowed on Wednesday night to aggressively go after those who misrepresent what health care change is all about, and he said he would ''not waste time'' with those who have made a political calculation to oppose him. But he left the door open to working with Republicans to cut health costs and expand coverage to millions of Americans.
 The White House offensive comes after a rocky August, in which many lawmakers held public meetings that deteriorated into shouting matches over health care.
 The president placed a price tag on the plan of about $900 billion over 10 years, which he said was ''less than we have spent on the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.'' And he sought to reassure the elderly and the Americans who already have insurance that they would not be worse off.
 As expected, Mr. Obama repeated his support for a government insurance plan to compete with the private sector, though he said he would consider alternatives to the ''public option.''
 He sketched out a vision for a plan in which it would be illegal for insurers to drop sick people or deny them coverage for pre-existing conditions, and in which every American would be required to carry health coverage, just as drivers must carry auto insurance.
 Mr. Obama did embrace some fresh proposals. He announced a new initiative to create pilot projects intended to curb medical malpractice lawsuits, a cause important to physicians and Republicans.
 He endorsed a plan, included in a proposal by Senator Max Baucus, the Montana Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, to help pay for expanding coverage by taxing insurance companies that offer expensive, so-called gold-plated insurance plans. And the president promised to include a provision that ''requires us to come forward with more spending cuts'' if the savings he envisions do not materialize.
 As Mr. Boehner and Mr. Cantor made clear on Thursday, Republicans are clearly primed for a fight; many, like Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who has been deeply involved in health negotiations, released statements about the speech even before it began. Mr. Grassley called on Mr. Obama to ''start building the kind of legislation that could win the support of 70 to 80 senators,'' a goal Mr. Grassley said could not be achieved if the bill contained a new government plan.

HEADLINE: For Open Rookie, Sure Hands and Aching Legs

BYLINE: By JOHN BRANCH

 BODY:
The United States Open scouting report on the first-year ball boy Jerry Loughran: great hands, good arm, sore legs. 
 It looks as if a plum exploded on his upper left thigh, a purple bruise from an as-yet-undiagnosed muscle tear. His mysteriously swollen right knee is hidden under a brace. His left calf is wrapped in a bandage. It hurts the most.
 ''One of the kids today said to me, 'Wow, my legs are really sore,' '' Loughran said. ''I said, 'If you feel that way, what do you think I feel like?' '' 
 Loughran is 61. He is taking Aleve in the morning, ibuprofen in the afternoon. ''But not too much,'' he pointed out. ''Because then I'd be loopy.'' 
 Like many older Americans, he had a few things he wanted to get done after he retired a couple of years ago: Get into an episode of ''Law & Order.'' (Check.) Learn to play the piano. (Incomplete.) Skydive. (Incomplete.) Be an Open ball boy. (Check.) 
 ''I'm a little bit nervous about a 'bucket list,' '' Loughran said. ''Once you're at the end, does that mean you have to check in?''
 He did not know that he would become the oldest ball boy or girl to earn a full-time spot at the Open, according to Open officials, a superlative that does not include Manny Herschkowitz, who made a one-set, side-court appearance as a ball boy 10 years ago at age 82.
 Fans have told Loughran that he inspires them. Some have joked that he must have lost his retirement savings in the tough economy. Many have called him Kramer.
 In a 1993 episode of ''Seinfeld,'' Kramer tried out as an Open ball boy. 
 ''Perhaps you've overlooked one of the key aspects of this activity,'' Jerry told Kramer. ''It's 'ball boys,' not 'ball men.' '' 
 For Loughran, who has two daughters and three grandchildren, it could be ''ballpa.'' 
 (Officially, the Open prefers ''ball person.'' About one quarter of them are women. The minimum age is 14, and the median age is 18.)
 When Kramer was taunted by a boy suggesting that there might be ''a better way to spend your twilight years,'' Kramer responded: ''I may be old, but I'm spry.'' He was assigned to the women's final, but plowed into Monica Seles during warm-ups.
 Loughran has made no such missteps, other than throwing a ball that hit a line judge who stepped into its path. Instead, he has been trusted with good assignments, such as two matches at the Grandstand, the third-largest stadium court behind Arthur Ashe and Louis Armstrong. 
 ''That is the goal,'' Loughran said. ''Come back next year and make Ashe.''
 Last week, he worked matches featuring the likes of Caroline Wozniacki, Juan Carlos Ferrero and Tommy Haas. 
 ''You can't beat being a ball boy for having the best seat in the house,'' Loughran said.
 This week, with the main draw drained of most participants, the matches involve mostly juniors, some of whom are less than one-quarter of Loughran's age. On Tuesday, Loughran worked a doubles match. The combined age of the four girls was 68. 
 It is an incongruous sight, to see teens playing a game while a gray-haired man chases the balls they hit around the court. 
 Speed, stealth and a servant's grace are of the essence. Loughran, as is his duty, shadows servers between points and presents balls to them like an eager hawker. He fetches towels and receives them back after they have absorbed a players' sweat. At changeovers between sets, he even holds an umbrella over the young players' heads to protect them from the sun. 
 ''I'm a very lucky guy,'' Loughran said. 
 He grew up in Rego Park, Queens, not far from the former Open home in Forest Hills, and was always fascinated by the choreography of the ball boys. But he did not try to become one until 2007, after he retired from his career as a labor-employment lawyer.
 He did not make it. In 2008, ready to try again, his wife, Grace, surprised him with a trip to Ireland for his 60th birthday. She inadvertently scheduled it for the same time as the tryouts. 
 So Loughran tried out again this summer. At the first screening, he showed that he could throw a tennis ball consistently, on one bounce, from one end of the court to the other, a major requirement. He could receive such throws cleanly, another prerequisite. He was called back. 
 He passed through a second audition, with more rigorous testing, and made the final cut. Loughran's eyes grew teary just thinking about the kind congratulations he received from others, many young enough to be his grandchildren. 
 None of the other 282 ball people who began the tournament -- many of whom are back in school -- are as old as 50. The few that have reached middle age generally have been working here annually since they were teenagers.
 ''This is America,'' said Tina Taps, the longtime director of ball people at the Open. ''Anyone has the opportunity. And with age, there are no boundaries.''
 Loughran is a willowy 6 feet and 170 pounds. He has run marathons and bikes and plays softball regularly. He has no problem with making the throws, even diagonally across the court. In a juniors match Tuesday on Court 7, he cleanly caught every ball -- dozens of them -- thrown to him, something others could not say. 
 What he did not expect was the sprinting. It starts before the match, when the six ball people stand silently and regally on one side of the court, waiting for the competitors to arrive. When the last competitor sets down his or her bag, the six ball people sprint to their positions, a maneuver called ''the burst.''
 Loughran works one of the four back positions, against the wall beyond the baseline. Every stray ball must be captured, even if that means hopping a fence -- something a fellow ball person had to do on Court 7 on Tuesday. 
 ''I really want to come back next year,'' Loughran said, looking down at his battered legs. ''And I want to prepare myself better, so the nicks and dings don't affect me so much.''
 In checking something off his bucket list, Loughran has added something else. 
 ''Maybe I'll take up yoga,'' he said. ''I think that'll give me the flexibility I'm looking for.''

HEADLINE: Repair Options For Ailing Electronics

BYLINE: By ALINA TUGEND. 
E-mail: shortcuts@nytimes.com

 BODY:
FOR months, I had been trying to ignore it. Like an ailing relative, my desktop computer was becoming increasingly frail. With each passing day, it took longer and longer to boot up. It sent endless ''connecting'' messages as I tried to get on the Internet. It froze in confusion if I clicked away too quickly.
 My first assumption was that it was time for a new computer. Ours was about five years old, relatively ancient in technological years. 
 But then I started thinking -- should I be so quick to assume that computers and the other gadgets of modern life, like iPods and game systems, are always ready to retire after two years, or three or four? For economic and environmental reasons (repairing is better than replacing), shouldn't I look into the possibility that we could salvage our computer? 
 I decided to call Adam Sanderson, chief executive of Computer Overhauls, based in Manhattan. I interviewed Mr. Sanderson about four years ago for a column and have since hired him occasionally for emergency computer problems.
 Mr. Sanderson remotely peeked into my computer and confirmed my worst fears -- the hard drive was dying.
 We could go out and buy a new one. Or, he suggested, we could ship or bring in the tower that contains the hard drive and he would replace it for about $150 -- far less than the cheapest desktop we could buy. Prices can be higher for more powerful hard drives and up to about $200 for laptops.
 ''We would clean out the whole machine, reinstall everything fresh and it would be like a brand-new computer,'' he told me.
 But then my software wouldn't be upgraded, would it? 
 No, Mr. Sanderson told me, but you may not really need to.
 ''It depends on what you're using the computer for,'' he said. ''If you're surfing the Internet and doing e-mail, which is what the bulk of people do, then you're only using 5 to 10 percent of the actual power of your computer anyhow. Most people don't need upgraded software.''
 The turnaround is about 48 hours, he said, and comes with a three-year guarantee.
 On the other hand, he said, if you are going to work on video editing or movie production, you probably want the newest software available. Also, any computer older than seven years should probably be replaced if it's having difficulties, he added.
 Mr. Sanderson also repairs iPods and iPhones, and his business is booming.
 ''There's definitely a huge surge in the amount of repairs'' in this economic climate, he said, as people choose to keep what they have rather than spend twice as much on the newest model.
 Once I started looking into it, I found a surprising array of repair options, ranging from specialized experts to a community of techies who offer free advice online. 
 Rapid Repair, for example, based in Kalamazoo, Mich., ''tries to serve an underserved population,'' by fixing game systems like Nintendo Wiis, PlayStations, Zune MP3 players, iPods and iPhones, said Aaron Vronko, service manager for Rapid Repair.
 The company, which does not repair computers, was founded in 2004 and fields about 500 requests a week, Mr. Vronko said. In general, he advised, repairs make sense if they can be done for less than half the cost of a new item.
 ''If you have a $200 gadget and you can repair it for $80 or $90, the customers sees value in saving over $100,'' he said. ''There's a certain feeling you get buying something new, but saving money is also good.''
 Suppose, for example, that your 30-gigabyte iPod with video has some problems. If the device is still under warranty, you send it back to Apple. If the warranty has lapsed, you can still send it to Apple and it will cost $129 to repair or $59 for a new battery, which is often the problem. 
 At Rapid Repair, the highest repair cost would $90, but often runs less if the trouble is minor. The company also offers to replace batteries for $20.
 ''About half our customers buy the parts and do their repairs themselves,'' Mr. Vronko said. He suggests, though, that once the item is about five years old, it's probably not worth fixing.
 What if the product is still under warranty, but something that isn't covered breaks, and you want to get someone to fix it for less than the manufacturer will charge? You need to check if the repair company is authorized by the manufacturer. If it is, then typically the repair can be done and the warranty remains valid if other problems crop up.
 Here is another option. Let's say you have a technologically savvy friend who is willing to help you figure out your computer's problem. But she lives in California and you live in London.
 There are a variety of services and software that allow you to remotely control a computer. I checked out a company called CrossLoop, which offers two options. You can download software from the company's Web site that allows you to remotely gain access to another computer system -- either MacIntosh or Microsoft Windows -- and diagnose the difficulty.
 To protect security, said Mrinal Desai, co-founder of CrossLoop, each time you and your friend use the software, you must type in a randomly generated 12-digit code that is changed for each use. And both of you have to do it within two minutes.
 Or, if you don't have a friend willing or able to help, you can hire one of the 14,000 experts listed on CrossLoop's site. They are posted with their experience, prices, customer ratings and where they are located -- which can be anywhere in the world. CrossLoop takes 15 percent of the experts' fees.
 Mr. Desai says that his company does not vet the experts, but rather, like eBay, the online community weeds out the bad ones through reviews and ratings.
 And if you like your expert, you can return to him again and again. ''He becomes your I.T. guy,'' Mr. Desai said.
 Want an even broader base to draw on for repairing just about anything? Try FixYa.com. If you have a problem with your lawn mower, computer, toaster or car, you can tap for free into the 250,000 ''enthusiasts,'' as FixYa's founder, Yaniv Bensadon, calls them.
 And if one of the enthusiasts is especially helpful, and well, enthusiastic, that person can be promoted to premium expert. For $20 you can have a live chat with your expert; for $13, you can have a one-time e-mail exchange; or, if you have a lot of fixing to do, you can sign up for a $10 monthly unlimited e-mail exchange.
 So, back to me and my failing computer. In the end, we decided that because the computer was five years old -- with a sticky keyboard and a few other problems as well -- we would opt for a new one. 
 I'm still getting used to it, so it's nice to know that there's a world of experts at my fingertips, just waiting to help.

HEADLINE: Gold Reaches New Highs As Shares End Day Lower

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
Few American consumers are lining up to buy expensive watches and rings. Profits at jewelry companies are down. But at the same time, plenty of investors are clamoring to buy precious metals. 
 As stocks drifted moderately lower on Friday, spot gold surged $8.60, to $1,005.20 an ounce as buyers sought an investment that would hold its value if inflation roared back. 
 The dollar skidded to its lowest point since last September against six major currencies, a sign that investors were pursuing higher returns elsewhere. The euro reached its highest level of the year against the dollar, rising to $1.4595.
 The spike in gold prices has puzzled some analysts. Although government deficits have ballooned in response to the financial crisis, there are few signs that inflation is in the offing. 
 But just as a speculative bubble drove oil prices to $145 a barrel last summer, prices of gold, silver, platinum and other precious metals could continue to soar as investors try to divine where the economy is heading, and whether a recovery will stoke rapid price increases.
 ''It all depends on the insanity,'' said Leonard Kaplan, president of Prospector Asset Management. ''Is it silly? Of course. Is it realistic? No. But can it go a lot higher? Yes.''
 Commodity prices have stormed higher in recent months as investors bet that a recovery would lift demand.
 But on Friday, crude oil prices, which tend to head in the same direction as gold, fell by the most in a week, slipping $2.65 to $69.29 a barrel, a sign that oil prices may have peaked around the $70 area. Most energy producers and shares of oil companies finished the day lower.
 In the stock market, investors moved their money away from consumer-oriented companies like Home Depot and McDonald's and out of basic-materials companies. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 22.07 points, or 0.2 percent, to 9,605.41, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 1.4 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,042.73. The Nasdaq composite dropped 3.12 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,080.9 points.
 Despite the day's losses, markets closed higher for the week. The Dow gained nearly 2 percent for the week, and the S.& P. 500 added 2.6 percent. 
 The indexes are close to their highest levels since last October, but analysts have questioned how much further they can climb in the face of high unemployment and lingering problems in the credit markets.

HEADLINE: Wholesale Inventories Fell 1.4% in July

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Businesses reduced inventories at the wholesale level for a record 11th consecutive month in July, but sales rose by the largest amount in more than a year, the Commerce Department said Friday. 
 The department said that wholesale inventories declined 1.4 percent in July, more than the 1 percent drop economists expected. That decline came after a 2.1 percent fall in June, worse than the 1.7 percent drop originally reported.
 Sales at the wholesale level rose 0.5 percent in July, the fourth consecutive increase and the biggest gain since a 2 percent jump in June 2008.
 Jennifer Lee, an economist at BMO Capital Markets, said the rebound in sales was encouraging and should help persuade businesses to restock their shelves and back lots, a development that could help the economy recover from recession.
 ''For the second half of this year, things are looking better than they were a few months ago with activity being helped by stimulus efforts such as the cash-for-clunkers program,'' Ms. Lee said.
 Still more positive news came on Friday when consumer confidence, as measured by the University of Michigan-Reuters survey, rose more than expected to a reading of 70.2 in early September, compared with 65.7 in August.
 The July inventory decline left the inventory-to-sales ratio at 1.23, meaning it would take 1.23 months to exhaust stockpiles. That was slightly lower than the 1.25 ratio in June, but still above the 1.13 inventory-to-sales ratio of a year ago.
 Weakness continued at many retail establishments, which reported lackluster back-to-school sales in August. Automakers, however, saw a spurt in activity from the government's clunkers program.

HEADLINE: A Year After a Cataclysm, Little Change on Wall St.

BYLINE: By ALEX BERENSON

 BODY:
Wall Street lives on.
 One year after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the surprise is not how much has changed in the financial industry, but how little.
 Backstopped by huge federal guarantees, the biggest banks have restructured only around the edges. Employment in the industry has fallen just 8 percent since last September. Only a handful of big hedge funds have closed. Pay is already returning to precrash levels, topped by the 30,000 employees of Goldman Sachs, who are on track to earn an average of $700,000 this year. Nor are major pay cuts likely, according to a report last week from J.P. Morgan Securities. Executives at most big banks have kept their jobs. Financial stocks have soared since their winter lows.
 The Obama administration has proposed regulatory changes, but even their backers say they face a difficult road in Congress. For now, banks still sell and trade unregulated derivatives, despite their role in last fall's chaos. Radical changes like pay caps or restrictions on bank size face overwhelming resistance. Even minor changes, like requiring banks to disclose more about the derivatives they own, are far from certain. 
 Coming on the same weekend as the 11th-hour bailout of the giant insurer American International Group, and the sale of Merrill Lynch, Lehman's failure was the climax of a cataclysmic weekend in the financial industry. In the days that followed, nearly everyone seemed to agree that Wall Street was due for fundamental change. Its ''heads I win, tails I'm bailed out'' model could not continue. Its eight-figure paydays would end.
 In fact, though, regulators and lawmakers have spent most of the last year trying to save the financial industry, rather than transform it. In the short run, their efforts have succeeded. Citigroup and other wounded banks have avoided bankruptcy, and the economy has sidestepped a depression. But the same investors and economists who predicted, and in some cases profited from, the collapse last fall say the rescue has come at an extraordinary cost. They warn that if the industry's systemic risks are not addressed, they could cause an even bigger crisis -- in years, not decades. Next time, they say, the credit of the United States government may be at risk.
 Simon Johnson, a professor at the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, said that the seeds of another collapse had already sprouted. If major banks are allowed to keep making bets that are ultimately backed by taxpayer guarantees, they will return to the practices that led them to underwrite trillions of dollars in bad loans, Professor Johnson said.
 ''They will run up big risks, they will fail again, they will hit us for a big check,'' he predicted.
 The doomsday view is far from universal.
 Wall Street executives say the Lehman bankruptcy opened their eyes to the fragility of their institutions. They note that they have pulled back on risk and reduced leverage, creating a bigger cushion against losses. And they say that regulators were right to support the financial industry over the last year, rather than imposing new rules or allowing weak banks to collapse. 
 ''There is less leverage in the entire financial system,'' said David A. Viniar, Goldman's chief financial officer. At Goldman, $1 in capital now supports about $14 in loans and investments, compared with $24 a year ago. 
 But even some senior Wall Street executives acknowledge the lack of change surprises them, given how poorly the industry performed last fall and the degree of government support necessary to keep it from collapsing.
 ''There was a general feeling that an enormous amount of additional regulation should be put in place to prevent what happened that weekend from happening again,'' said Byron Wien, vice chairman of Blackstone Advisory Services and the former chief investment strategist for Morgan Stanley and Pequot Capital. ''So far, we haven't seen a lot of action.''
 Robert J. Shiller, the Yale University economics professor who predicted the dot-com crash and the housing bust, said the window for change may be closing. ''People will accept change at a time of crisis, but we haven't managed to do much, and maybe complacency is coming back,'' Professor Shiller said. ''We seem to be losing momentum.''
 Kenneth C. Griffin, founder and chief executive of the Citadel Investment Group, a Chicago-based hedge fund that manages $13 billion, said that regulators and lawmakers needed to impose rules so failing banks could be shut, rather than allowed to operate indefinitely with taxpayer support.
 ''We've taken a lot of steps for the worse, and not for the better, in terms of the structural underpinnings of our capital markets,'' Mr. Griffin said. ''We have to change the rules and correct the fundamental flaws in the financial system.''
 To be sure, Wall Street is not exactly as it was before the cataclysm of last year.
 Then, a dozen or so big banks formed the top tier. Now Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase are clearly the strongest, with Morgan Stanley struggling to compete. Bank of America and Citigroup are the weakest big banks, heavily reliant on government guarantees to survive.
 ''We have more separation between the healthiest and the least healthy of the big banks,'' said Darrell Duffie, a finance professor at Stanford University. 
 Banks have collectively raised hundreds of billions in new capital to help cushion losses on bad loans and are taking a more prudent approach to lending and underwriting. The worst excesses of 2006 and 2007, when banks lent hundreds of billions of dollars against all kinds of real estate at terms that even at the time seemed absurd, have ended. 
 But those changes are not unexpected. Banks typically raise lending standards during recessions. And even if they wanted to keep up underwriting, they would not find much of a market. Many pension and hedge funds have suffered huge losses on mortgage-backed bonds and are hardly rushing to buy more.
 Critics of the industry argue that the pullback in risk will be only temporary without deep regulatory changes. Nassim Nicholas Taleb, a statistician, trader, and author, has argued for years that financial firms chronically underestimate their risks and must be managed much more cautiously. Universa Investments, a $5 billion fund in which he is a principal, made more than 100 percent profit last year betting on the possibility of a collapse.
 Mr. Taleb warns that the system has grown riskier since last fall. The extensive government support that began after Lehman collapsed will lead investors to assume that governments will always prevent major banks from collapsing, he said.
 So investors will lend money to the financial industry on easy terms. In turn, financial institutions will use that cheap money to make risky loans and trades. The banks will keep the profits when their bets pay off, while taxpayers will swallow the losses when the bets go bad and threaten the system. 
 Economists call the phenomenon moral hazard. Bankers have a different term: I.B.G. The phrase implies that by the time a deal goes sour, ''I'll be gone,'' after having received a sizable bonus.
 Despite the predictions last year about pay cuts, those bonuses appear secure. Kian Abouhossein, an analyst at J.P. Morgan in London, predicted this week that eight major American and European banks would pay the 141,000 employees in their investment banking units $77 billion in 2011 -- about $543,000 per worker, not far from the 2007 peak -- even after minor regulatory changes are adopted. 
 Because the rewards are so rich, the banks will not change unless regulators and lawmakers force them, Mr. Taleb said.
 ''I don't know anyone on Wall Street who goes to work every day thinking of anything but how to increase their bonus,'' he said.
 To prevent a replay of last year's crisis, investors in financial institutions, especially bondholders, must believe that they will lose money if banks fail, said Sheila C. Bair, the chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. ''You need to send that very strong, clear signal to restore market discipline,'' Ms. Bair said.
 But legislation that would allow regulators to close giant institutions in an orderly fashion has been stalled for months. So too have efforts to create a systemic regulator that would focus on the broader risk that might occur from the ripple effects caused by the failure of one major bank.
 Another proposed change would require banks to list and trade derivatives through a central clearinghouse, just as stocks and options are traded through exchanges, but it has yet to go anywhere. 
 The term derivatives encompasses a variety of financial products, including contracts whose value changes as interest rates move and insurance that pays off if a bond defaults. Derivatives drove the boom before 2008 by encouraging banks to make loans without adequate reserves. They also worsened the panic last fall because they inherently tie institutions together. Investors worried that the collapse of one bank would lead to big losses at others.
 Requiring that derivatives be traded openly sounds like a relatively small change, but it could have important effects.
 Exchange trading would open pricing for derivatives, so banks could not hide money-losing positions. Banks would have to put up money as positions moved against them, since the exchanges would seize and sell derivatives that were not backed by adequate margin. That move would help avoid the situation A.I.G. faced last year, after it wrote hundreds of billions of dollars of credit insurance and had no money to make good on its promises when the bonds defaulted. But critics say that even the proposed changes would not go far enough, because they would exempt some complex derivatives from exchange trading or clearing. Moreover, some banks oppose opening derivatives trading, because it would cut their profits by making pricing more visible and as a consequence competitive. For now, legislation to force derivatives trading onto exchanges has stalled, and banks are still writing contracts with limited regulatory oversight.
 ''The off-exchange derivatives market is still the Wild West,'' Ms. Bair said.

HEADLINE: U.S.D.A. Forecasts Bumper Soybean and Corn Crops

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
United States farmers should reap a record soybean crop and a near-record corn crop this year, the Agriculture Department said Friday. The agency forecast a corn crop of 12.954 billion bushels and a soybean crop of 3.245 billion bushels. The corn crop would be 84 million bushels shy of the record 13.038 billion bushels harvested in 2007. The soybean record is 3.188 billion bushels, set in 2006. The U.S.D.A. estimated corn yields at a record 161.9 bushels an acre and soybeans at 42.3 bushels an acre, the No. 3 yield. Futures prices for both crops fell slightly on the Chicago Board of Trade.

HEADLINE: Around the World, Stock Markets Fell and Rose, Together

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and economics in his blog at nytimes.com/norris.

 BODY:
The United States stock market has just completed its best six months since 1933. From March 9 to Sept. 9, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index leaped by 53 percent.
 But the gain over that period, which began when stocks reached their nadir in March, was not enough to offset the losses recorded in the previous six months. Not since 1932 had the market suffered a half-year period as bad as that one.
 Investors clearly found it difficult to determine whether the Great Recession would turn into Great Depression II. 
 Amazingly, however, the American stock market was one of the least volatile markets in the world in the last year. It was among the best markets when it was plunging, and among the worst when it was soaring. Over all, it ranked near the bottom among international markets.
 Whatever else you might want to say about the virtues of international diversification, in this cycle it has done little to balance the risks of investing in any one market. When the markets went down, they nearly all went down. When the markets rose, they soared together.
 If history is a guide, the strong recovery may be an indication that better prices are still ahead. Since World War II, there have been eight periods before the current market when the S.& P. 500 managed to rise at least 30 percent over a half-year period -- in 1963, 1971, 1975, 1980, 1982-83, 1991, 1997 and 1999. A year later, the index had made further gains in seven of them.
 The exception was 1980, when the economy went into a double-dip recession and dashed the hopes of investors who had bet on a continued rise in stock prices.
 Before that, the record was less impressive. Soaring prices in 1929 presaged the Great Depression, and a sharp rebound in 1930 proved to be a suckers' rally. But big gains in 1932-33 and 1935 were followed by additional gains. Prices were little changed a year after large gains in 1938 and 1943.
 The accompanying graphic demonstrates the truth of an old adage: If you lose 50 percent of your money, and then gain 50 percent, you have not come close to breaking even.
 Italy provides one of the best examples of that. Over the six-month period ending on Wednesday, the FTSE/MIB index of Italian stocks rose 81 percent in euros. With the euro also strong against the dollar during that period, the Italian index more than doubled, rising 109 percent from the perspective of a dollar-based investor.
 But an investor who put money in the Italian stock market exactly one year before, on Sept. 9, 2008, suffered a decline of 55 percent in euros, or 60 percent in dollars, during the next six months. The Italian market, like the American market, hit bottom on March 9 of this year.
 The net impact: For the 12 months, the Italian market was down 17 percent, whether measured in euros or in dollars.
 The accompanying graphic shows the performance of major stock market indexes in each of the 19 countries in the Group of 20, as well as of a European-wide index that is shown because the European Union is the final member of the Group of 20, whose leaders will meet later this month in Pittsburgh, to discuss efforts to fight the world financial crisis.
 For the entire year, the best performances were turned in by emerging markets, which are back in favor with investors hopeful of a resumption of global growth. China, whose market had plunged earlier than most, was the only one to rise during the six-month period through March 9, and was the best performer for the entire year. Brazil, Indonesia and South Africa also showed gains for the 12 months, while the Indian market broke even and the South Korean market nearly did the same.
 For the entire year, the largest declines were in Saudi Arabia and Russia, oil producers that suffered from lower oil prices brought on by the global slowdown. 
 The similarity in international performance can also be seen within markets. During the most recent six months, the three best-performing sectors in the S.& P. 500, and in the S.& P. Europe 350, were financials, industrials and materials. During the previous six months, they were the worst-performing sectors in both indexes.

 Wild Times in Stocks: The American stock market hit bottom on March 9, ending the worst six-month stretch for the Standard & Poor's 500 since 1932. In the following six months, it rose more than in any comparable period since 1933.

HEADLINE: Fedex Raises Profit Outlook For 2 Quarters

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The FedEx Corporation said profit in both the current and next quarter would be higher than Wall Street had expected, citing an improving economy and stable fuel prices, and its shares rose 6 percent to their best level in nearly a year. FedEx said it now expected to report first-quarter earnings of 58 cents a share and second-quarter earnings of 65 cents to 95 cents a share. That compares with analysts' expectations of 43 cents and 70 cents. Stock in FedEx, which is based in Memphis, Tenn., rose $4.66, to $77.32 a share.

HEADLINE: They're Not Afraid of Virginia Woolf

BYLINE: By JON CARAMANICA

 BODY:
The economic climate remains chilly, but in indie rock, privilege is so hot right now.
 There's Vampire Weekend -- former Columbia students and arch auteurs of the new-prep aesthetic -- and in its wake, an agglomeration of acolytes, opportunistic cynics and well-timed peers. Googling ''Vampire Weekend cover band'' reveals some of each. (What happened to the VW Bugs, the supposed Vampire Weekend tribute band that advertised for members on Craigslist this summer?) 
 Some mildly mocking coverage of the young Los Angeles band Princeton, which played Union Hall on Wednesday night, pops up in that search. And even beyond the name -- actually a reference to the Santa Monica street some members grew up on, not the university, but still -- it's easy to see why.
 Like Vampire Weekend, Princeton toys with nominally African and Caribbean figures in its indie rock, adding brightness and velocity. And as with Vampire Weekend, there's a certain inaccessibility to Princeton's songwriting, which teems with tales of the well heeled. Princeton's ''Bloomsbury'' EP (Striking Peasant), released last year, was inspired by the Bloomsbury literary set, and the band performed those songs earlier this year with the Stephen Pelton Dance Theater as part of a Virginia Woolf conference. (At Union Hall, you could buy a T-shirt featuring Woolf wearing sunglasses.)
 But Princeton -- Jesse and Matt Kivel, soft-cheeked identical twins who trade off guitar and bass, as well as lead vocals; the keyboardist Ben Usen; and the drummer David Kitz -- isn't nearly as uppity as its reference points, or its colleagues. The band's debut album, ''Cocoon of Love'' (Kanine), which will be released this month, is charming and frisky, with touches of the Cure and Leonard Cohen, and even some shoegaze pop. And onstage, the band was improbably tender, even a bit naive, undercutting its lyrical hauteur at almost every turn.
 Of the twins, who have almost identical voices, Jesse was looser, standing at center stage and grinning shyly. Matt, slightly off to the left, was slightly more stoic, dressed sensibly in a button-down shirt with sleeves rakishly rolled to the elbows, tucked into slacks and belted tight. Mr. Usen was retiring behind his setup. Only Mr. Kitz suggested even a hint of arrogance, playing deceptively simple arrangements with authority.
 Princeton's set began sweetly with ''The Waves,'' which, without the strings on the recorded version, had less pomp and more zip. On ''Sadie & Andy'' the band was joined by the coy singer Amy Hager, from Ice Palace, and Tim Cronin, who plays with Camera Obscura, on trumpet. Mr. Cronin stuck around for some mournful countermelodies on ''Show Some Love, When Your Man Gets Home,'' which otherwise pulsed with a 1950s slickness.
 On the jangly ''Eminent Victorians'' Jesse moved to the back of the stage to help out on drums, while Matt sang wistfully of suburban angst. It was the most confident the band appeared all night, achieving an attitude to match its songs. But as the rest of the show demonstrated, maybe privilege doesn't have to be snobbish after all.

HEADLINE: Agreement Gives Leibovitz More Time to Repay Loans

BYLINE: By ALLEN SALKIN

 BODY:
In a 13th-hour agreement on Friday, the photographer Annie Leibovitz avoided having to give up her homes and her artistic property to the finance company that had lent her $24 million. But all she may have won is time. 
 The Art Capital Group, which specializes in loans secured by artwork, had given Ms. Leibovitz a $24 million one-year loan that was due on Tuesday. As collateral, she pledged the rights to all of her intellectual property, including her photographs, as well as three adjoining town houses in Greenwich Village and a home in Rhinebeck, N.Y. 
 On Friday, three days after the deadline, Ms. Leibovitz and Art Capital announced that they had reached an agreement on a loan extension. 
 Ms. Leibovitz, 59, perhaps the most famous and best-compensated living photographer, has been enduring a well-chronicled and much-puzzled-over financial meltdown. 
 As part of the loan agreement, Ms. Leibovitz gave Art Capital the right to act as her agent in selling her archive of photos, including her negatives, and her homes, according to legal documents.
 The company sued Ms. Leibovitz in July, claiming that she was blocking its efforts to prepare her homes and photos for sale, and was not paying loan-related fees. On Sept. 1, her lawyers won a one-month extension to respond to the lawsuit. As part of the agreement, Art Capital withdrew its suit. 
 In a joint statement the two sides said that Ms. Leibovitz had ''purchased from Art Capital its rights to act as exclusive agent in the sale of her real property and copyrights'' and that she will ''therefore retain control of those assets within the context of the loan agreement.'' The property and copyrights remain as collateral. 
 Throughout her financial difficulties, Ms. Leibovitz has said little publicly. On Friday she spoke only through the joint statement, which quoted her as saying, ''In these challenging times I am appreciative to Art Capital for all they have done to resolve this matter and for their cooperation and continued support.''
 But legal experts said her troubles were not over. 
 ''If the original loan term was a year, typically the extension could be as short as 30 days or it could be a year,'' said Eliot Zuckerman, a real estate lawyer in Manhattan who is not involved with either party. 
 To win the extension, Ms. Leibovitz might have agreed to sell something valuable quickly, like the rights to some photographs or a home, or to pay more interest.
 ''The great likelihood is she had to demonstrate to them how she is going to come up with the money and how soon she is going to come up with the money,'' Mr. Zuckerman said. ''Of course there could have been an interest rate increase as well.''
 Friends said yesterday that Ms. Leibovitz had the tenacity to figure out a way to pay off her loan this time, but that she might have to change her relationship to money fundamentally. 
 ''Is she scrappy enough to pull this out?'' said Graydon Carter, the editor of Vanity Fair. ''Absolutely. I'd never count Annie out on anything.''

HEADLINE: Goodbye, Gobbledygook

BYLINE: By ASHLEE VANCE

DATELINE: SUNNYVALE, Calif. 

 BODY:
For the last 30 years, the computer industry has bragged about its achievements. And when the industry was excited about a breakthrough, it expected -- even demanded -- that consumers get excited, too. But that less-than-symbiotic relationship may be coming to an end. 
 What the industry calls a ''fact tag'' has been evidence of its hubris. 
 The fact tag sits next to PCs at stores like Best Buy and Fry's, bewildering one consumer after another. It trumpets things like DDR2 RAM, 5400 r.p.m. hard drives, Turion benchmark scores and the robust L2 cache sizes of Core 2 Duos. 
 Once cherished, the fact tag has turned into an object of scorn as PC makers finally reach a realization that many other industries discovered ages ago: the consumer is truly king. 
 ''We have been stuck in 1995,'' said Leslie Sobon, the vice president of product marketing at the chip maker Advanced Micro Devices. ''We are basically the laggards.'' 
 Over the last couple of years, the industry has made a slow lurch away from its engineering roots toward a more shopper-friendly strategy that recognizes that if you make your product simpler to understand, more people will buy it. 
 Intel, for example, has spent less time talking about its variety of chip brands and more time hawking products under its flagship Core brand. 
 ''We were our own worst enemy, making it confusing about which chip is best for a computer,'' said Deborah Conrad, the vice president of corporate marketing at Intel. 
 A.M.D., Intel's main rival, took an even more drastic step on Thursday, announcing a new marketing program, in conjunction with retailers like Wal-Mart and Best Buy, that emphasizes computer uses over specifications. The old tradition of flogging 220 different combinations of A.M.D. chips has been traded in and replaced with three categories of PCs: See, Share and Create systems (the designations roughly line up with ''good,'' better'' and ''best''). A.M.D.'s 40-page manual that explained its technical wizardry to salespeople has met its demise as well, replaced with a two-page pamphlet. 
 PC makers began to sniff a change in consumer sensibilities a couple of years ago and, often influenced by Apple, went on a quest to find their swagger. Dell, for example, placed a premium on design, wrapping computers in everything from brushed aluminum to bamboo sheaths. Hewlett-Packard hired the fashion designer Vivienne Tam to construct a multicolored, purselike laptop and put a slick piano-black finish on its main product line. 
 Computer makers have tried to make life easier by sidestepping Microsoft's Windows and adding their own user interfaces. Many of these changes come less from a sense of largess than a sense of desperation. 
 While under attack from several fronts -- including smartphones and the growth of online applications and services -- the industry has also seen its usual safety net, the corporate market, dry up. Last year, for the first time, consumers bought more PCs than businesses did. 
 Meeting the needs of these newly empowered consumers meant that the PC industry had to come up with a new bag of sales tricks. The method of championing faster, bigger components did less for a group that found yesteryear's machines adequate for most of its needs. 
 Now, many consumers desire a speedy Internet connection above all else. They are the people buying the underpowered, low-cost netbooks, providing the PC industry with its lone bright spot (though lower profit margins) during the recession. 
 Traditionally, PC makers relied on their software partners to build bulkier, more demanding applications that required new hardware. But that strategy has fallen apart. Consumers and businesses balked at Microsoft's bloated Vista operating system, so the company's upcoming Windows 7 software should actually require less horsepower and storage space to run well. The same goes for Apple's new Snow Leopard operating system. 
 Intel has dabbled with what it called ''use-model marketing,'' where computers were aimed at people who wanted to play games or those who wanted entertainment like movies over the gearhead speak of a fact tag. Intel poured money into its Viiv concept, which centered on using computers for entertainment, only to find that it confused consumers who also wanted to use the machines to do work. Intel has since turned elsewhere for answers. 
 ''We have been looking at the automotive industry,'' said Ms. Conrad. ''Computers have become an emotional purchase like cars. We're getting very emotional with our marketing and advertising.'' 
 And, like carmakers that spend ages fine-tuning the sound of a slammed door, Dell has focused on the touch and sound of its computers. This idea has even carried over to the company's data-center hardware with replaceable components like fans, which no longer have to just work but must have aesthetic appeal as well. 
 ''Things like the feel of a fan module coming out were the things really driving customer perceptions of our products,'' said Ken Musgrave, Dell's head of industrial design. ''Was it rattling? Did it drag on the metal?'' 
 Workers now also want their computers at work to look as good as their computers at home. 
 ''Back in the olden days, you had a computer at work and that informed what you might buy at home and now that has switched,'' Ms. Conrad said. 
 A number of companies have started to give employees a budget for their computers, allowing them to pick any machine they like. Typically, these workers will pack their computers with software for work and play like social networking or watching YouTube, blurring boundaries between the home and office.
 And so the kingly consumer has started to change the business world as well. 
 ''The Internet and all of these mobile devices have created this consumer expectation that they can and should have everything they want right now,'' said John Jordan, the president of BusinesSuites, which provides staffed office space to businesses. ''They bring those expectations into the office on Monday morning.''

HEADLINE: Ikea Tries to Build Public Case Against Russian Corruption

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER

DATELINE: MOSCOW 

 BODY:
Weeks before the opening of its flagship store outside Moscow in 2000, Ikea was approached by employees of a local utility company. If the Swedish retailer wanted to have electricity for its grand opening, it had to pay a bribe. 
 Instead, Ikea rented diesel generators large enough to power a shopping mall. The generators roared to life in a loud rebuke to the corrupt executives who thought they had the retailer cornered, and soon the utility turned on the power. 
 As Ikea opened stores across Russia, and became one of the most outspoken Western corporate critics of Russian corruption, renting generators to thwart extortion from power companies became standard practice. Ikea executives took great pride in their creative solution -- renting generators ''instead of putting ourselves into a squeeze,'' as Christer Thordson, an Ikea board member and global director of legal affairs, put it in an interview. 
 But Russian graft may have proved more stubborn than Ikea. 
 The board of Ikea's operating company, which is based in the Netherlands, has concluded that the Russian executive hired to manage the generators was taking kickbacks from the rental company to substantially inflate the price of the service. Ikea said that such a fraud could cost it about $196 million over two years. 
 Ikea canceled the contract and sought redress in Russian civil court. But in rulings over the last two weeks, Ikea has lost another 5 million euros in damages that the judges awarded the generator rental company for breach of contract. 
 Ikea disclosed the details of its loss to The New York Times last month, saying that it hoped publicity might compel the Russian authorities to investigate. 
 ''We have encountered something here that is outside the scope of what we normally encounter,'' Mr. Thordson said, describing the global retailer's situation in Russia. ''I have never experienced anything like this.'' 
 The director of the generator rental company and the former Ikea employee accused of accepting bribes denied any wrongdoing. 
 Russia is a maddeningly opaque but potentially lucrative market of 140 million people, whose incomes are supported by trickle-down oil wealth. Many global businesses contend they must have a presence in Russia to remain competitive. On Thursday, Carrefour, the French hypermarket chain, opened its second store in Russia. Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, has an advance team in Moscow but has yet to invest. 
 For Ikea, the argument for being in Russia is even more compelling: When it comes to household durables -- the home furnishings that are Ikea's bread and butter -- Russia is a gold mine of need. 
 In more developed countries, such as the United States, the challenge is to elicit a replacement purchase because most customers already own most standard pieces of furniture. 
 The company slyly acknowledged this in its advertisements in the United States, encouraging Americans to ''have more tables than spouses.'' Ikea says the average North American changes both dining room tables and spouses only 1.5 times in a lifetime. 
 Russia, in contrast, has a lingering deficit of durable consumer goods, a hangover from the Soviet command economy. 
 As a result, Russia now accounts for 5 percent of Ikea's business worldwide. Before the global economic crisis, Ikea's business here was growing at 20 percent a year. Ikea's stores here are wildly popular. So many Russians show up for store openings that Ikea has hired ambulances to be on hand in case of accidents. 
 Mr. Thordson, the board member, acknowledged that executives were slow to notice soaring costs for generator rentals amid the company's pell-mell rush to expand. When the scope of the expense came to light last year, the board hired a London-based private investigation company to examine its Russian operations. 
 The investigators secured a deposition from a former employee of the generator rental company detailing how an Ikea executive had been accepting weekly cash payments to influence management's choice in the lucrative generator contract for two malls outside St. Petersburg. 
 The ballooning costs built into these two deals were so large they eliminated all profit from Ikea's business managing a dozen shopping centers in Russia in 2008, Mr. Thordson said. 
 Ikea built two furniture stores anchoring malls timed to open just before the year-end retail rush in 2006. Then, as before, the local electricity company dragged its feet. Ikea, by then familiar with the problem, had contracted for generators; both sites opened on time. But this time, the utility never switched on the power at either site. Three years later, the malls are still powered by diesel generators. 
 The contracts for these generators charged far more than market rates, and the Ikea executive who arranged them was receiving a portion, according to Mr. Thordson and lawyers for Ikea. 
 The Russian courts have rejected Ikea's claim of fraud. The director and co-owner of the generator rental company, Konstantin A. Ponomarev, denied in a telephone interview that his company, Sistemy Avtonomnovo Energosnabzhenia, paid an Ikea executive to secure the contract. Ikea, he said, had declined his offer to move the litigation to Sweden. Ikea officials said Tuesday that they had never heard an offer to change venues. 
 The generator service was expensive, Mr. Ponomarev said, because it was intended for standby power but Ikea had used it to continually supply two huge shopping centers. 
 Yuri G. Volkov, the former Ikea executive accused in the deposition of taking payments, denied doing so and said Russian police had investigated the claim and cleared him. Mr. Volkov said Ikea's country managers were seeking to conceal their own expensive incompetence by blaming Russian subordinates. 
 Meanwhile, Stanislav S. Voskresenskiy, a Russian deputy minister of economic development, said in an interview that he had already been investigating Ikea's troubles on the ministry's initiative. The case, he said, is reflecting poorly on Russia's image among foreign investors. Mr. Voskresenskiy said he had looked into the generator issue. Corrupt government officials, he said, were not to blame. 
 ''It was fraud, but Ikea employees did it to themselves,'' he said. 
 Russia knows it has a corruption problem: President Dmitri A. Medvedev has made fighting graft a focus of his presidency. Transparency International, an anti-corruption group, ranked Russia 147th out of 180 countries -- a tie with Bangladesh and Kenya -- on clean government and business, based on a global surveys of business executives. 
 Ikea still operates in Russia, but has frozen future investment. In June, an arbitration appellate court in Moscow awarded Mr. Ponomarev's company 5 million euros ($7.1 million) in two judgments for breach of contract. Ikea appealed and, as a condition of suspending enforcement until the appeal was heard, deposited the amount of the damage claim in an escrow account with the court. The deposit was intended to be held by the court and paid to Mr. Ponomarev's company only if the appeal were unsuccessful. 
 Yet, separately, a lower court judge issued an order to withdraw money directly from Ikea's accounts at Citibank in Russia and pay it to Mr. Ponomarev. This happened over the last two weeks. In other words, Ikea is now out $14.2 million, twice the damage award, even before its appeal has been heard. 
 Ikea lawyers, in a letter to the board of Ikea's operating company, said the opposing lawyers seemed to know the outcome of these cases in advance, suggesting collusion with the judges. Calls Tuesday and Wednesday to the public relations office of the Ninth Arbitration Court of Appeals in Moscow were not answered. Even if the appeal is successful, returning the money may be impossible. 
 ''I can only suspect there have been some irregularities behind the scenes,'' Mr. Thordson said.

HEADLINE: The Wild Card

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
There's a lot to appreciate in the latest incarnation of the Democrats' Sisyphean-like campaign to overhaul the nation's health care system. In the current environment, matters are growing worse almost by the hour.
 Horrendous job losses and an economy that is in shambles are driving up the number of people without health insurance. ''Every day,'' said President Obama in his speech to Congress this week, ''14,000 Americans lose their coverage.'' 
 This is occurring at the same time that the immense baby boomer generation is approaching retirement age, the age when even under the best of circumstances the need for health care steadily rises.
 Even those with health insurance frequently find themselves on shaky ground, worried that they will lose it if they lose their jobs or that the coverage will not meet their real-world needs.
 So most Americans are prepared to listen when the Democrats try to make the case for changes that would, among other things, prevent insurance companies from denying coverage because of pre-existing conditions, prevent them from engaging in the perverse practice of canceling policies when the policyholder gets ill, put an end to arbitrary caps on annual or lifetime coverage and limit what policyholders could be charged for deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses.
 When you factor in the explosive costs of health care, which are making American businesses less competitive and threatening to bankrupt the government, the case for reform would seem to be a slam dunk.
 But there's a wild card out there undermining the chances for real reform, and it's not the crazies who have been disrupting health care forums or the disrespectful space cadet legislators like the South Carolina Congressman Joe (''You lie!'') Wilson. It's the ordinary working men and women of America who are struggling with the worst economic downturn they have ever seen and who are worried that the big new plans that the Democrats have in store may not be in their best interests -- and may not be affordable.
 Many of those folks already have health insurance, and many voted for Barack Obama. But they're scared to death now as the economy continues to hemorrhage jobs and the budget deficits unfolding before their eyes are being counted in the trillions.
 To get meaningful health care reform this time around, the Democrats will have to get that constituency on board. They haven't yet.
 For one thing, the various proposals are not at all clear to the general public and the average citizen is clueless as to how any of them would be paid for. To say that people are skeptical is the grossest understatement.
 When the administration talks about getting hundreds of billions of dollars in savings from Medicare to help finance health care reform, it sends a shudder not just through Medicare recipients (who like their coverage just fine and don't want anyone tampering with it), but also through younger individuals concerned about elderly relatives on Medicare.
 The president said in his speech that the savings would come from eliminating ''hundreds of billions of dollars in waste and fraud'' and the elimination of some unwarranted subsidies. But to the finely tuned ear of the general public, that's exactly what politicians always say: We're going to get rid of waste and fraud.
 The administration would contend that this time will be different. One can understand why some will remain unconvinced.
 The president also said, as he estimated the cost of his proposal at $900 billion over 10 years, that he ''will not sign a plan that adds one dime to our deficits -- either now or in the future.''
 I'm sure he means it. But I have not spoken to anyone, either on Capitol Hill or elsewhere, who believes that is doable. Now it may be that the public should not be so worried about the deficits. They had to be jacked up to get the country through this terrible economic crisis. And health care reform -- real reform -- is essential if long-term deficits are to be brought under control.
 But people are worried about it. And just saying that health care reform will not add to the deficits is not enough to allay those fears.
 What's missing from all the talk about reform is how the runaway costs of health care, and all the dire consequences associated with them, can be reined in without a strong public insurance option and other big-time cost-saving initiatives.
 If the government requires everyone -- or nearly everyone -- to have health insurance, the insurance companies and the pharmaceutical industry will reap a bonanza. What the Democrats still have to make clear to ordinary working men and women is how this latest incarnation of health care reform will be cost effective and broadly beneficial to them and to their government.

HEADLINE: Gov. Richardson's Future Is Again Talk of Santa Fe

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

DATELINE: SANTA FE, N.M. 

 BODY:
Gov. Bill Richardson got a standing ovation at a speech last week, and he said it felt like a hug from an old friend. It had been more than nine months since he was received with anything more than polite applause.
 Mr. Richardson has emerged battered but unbeaten after a yearlong federal investigation into accusations that his aides steered bond business to a big campaign contributor. Prosecutors abandoned the inquiry two weeks ago, but not before making it impossible for the governor to accept a cabinet post in the Obama administration, crimping his influence at home and damaging his popularity. 
 ''I now know the burden of being unfairly accused,'' Mr. Richardson said this week in an interview.
 ''A cloud has been lifted,'' he continued, ''and I feel vindicated, and I feel like I'm back 100 percent.''
 It has been a rough period for Mr. Richardson, a Democrat and arguably the most popular and powerful governor in his state's history. 
 Now, however, he has returned to form, political scientists here say. His poll numbers are creeping up, and a national appointment is again a possibility. Everyone in Santa Fe, the capital, is speculating about what he will do next. He has 14 months left as governor and cannot serve another term. 
 In recent weeks, the governor has been active on the international scene, sparking rumors that President Obama might offer another assignment. He was in Cuba on a trade mission the day it was announced that the United States attorney in Albuquerque had abandoned efforts to bring criminal charges against him, leading New Mexican pundits to wonder aloud if he might be named special envoy to that island. 
 He also hosted a delegation of North Korean officials in the state, after having played a minor advisory role in the release of two Korean-American journalists imprisoned there. Recently, he took on another international mission, agreeing to try to help free three American hikers imprisoned in Iran.
 Mr. Richardson said these freelance forays into international affairs signified nothing. He is emphatic that he is not angling for a job in Washington, although, as always, he does not rule anything out. 
 ''I'm not planning my next move to Washington,'' said the governor, whose own presidential campaign fizzled last year. ''That used to be an agenda of mine, but no longer.'' 
 Nor does the private sector hold any appeal. ''I have no interest in lobbying,'' Mr. Richardson said. ''I have no interest in making money. I have no interest in leaving New Mexico.''
 The governor said he planned to use his last year in office to focus on reducing the dropout rate in the state's public schools and to cement its position as a leader in solar technology and other alternative sources of energy. Both appear to be efforts to shore up his legacy, politicians here say.
 He also faces a budget crisis. The collapse of natural gas prices and the national recession have squeezed revenues, and a $441 million revenue shortfall has opened in the current budget, threatening to undo some of the expansion in spending that has occurred in his two terms in office. Next year's forecasts are just as bleak.
 ''Our bubble has burst, and all the employees we hired -- and then raised their salaries -- all that's going to come home to roost,'' said the State Senate president pro tempore, Timothy Z. Jennings, a Democrat.
 In political terms, Mr. Richardson's fall from grace gave Republicans an opening and a platform for trying to take back the governorship next year. Conservatives have been honing their anticorruption speeches and hoping to tar the leading Democratic candidate, Lt. Gov. Diane Denish, with the administration's perceived pay-to-play troubles. 
 That strategy makes sense, because, quite apart from the accusations against the governor, several other Democrats have been indicted on corruption charges in the last two years. 
 And, said the state Republican chairman, Harvey Yates, the assistant United States attorney, Gregory J. Fouratt, never actually exonerated Mr. Richardson. In his last letter to defense lawyers, Mr. Fouratt said the investigation had ''revealed that pressure from the governor's office resulted in the corruption of the procurement process.'' 
 This last salvo from Mr. Fouratt, a Republican, enraged Mr. Richardson and his aides. ''My administration acted entirely properly,'' the governor said in the interview. ''We did nothing wrong.'' 
 Republicans say the lack of an indictment may not matter much. ''In politics, you don't necessarily have to be convicted,'' Senator Stuart Ingle, the Republican minority leader, said. ''The voters can be the best grand jury of all.''
 That said, Ms. Denish is the favorite to win. She has already amassed a $2 million campaign fund, and no strong Republican candidate has emerged to challenge her.
 For his part, Mr. Richardson says he will stay out of the race. He looks forward, he said, to finishing out his term. Then he plans to take some time off to travel the country in a car -- driving himself for the first time in years -- to fulfill his longtime dream of visiting every major league baseball park.
 ''I look forward to becoming a normal person,'' he said.

CORRECTION-DATE: September 17, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An article on Saturday about the future of Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico misstated the ancestry of one of the two American journalists recently released from prison in North Korea. (Mr. Richardson played a minor advisory role in their release.) Laura Ling is Chinese-American -- not Korean-American, which is the ancestry of Euna Lee, who was also released.

HEADLINE: That September Deadline

 BODY:
The United States and the other major powers have given Iran until late September to begin substantive negotiations on restraining its nuclear program. And Tehran has now announced that it is ready to resume talks, and the Obama administration says it is ready, too. Unfortunately, there is no sign that Iran is serious about doing much more than buying more time. 
 On Wednesday, Tehran presented a proposed agenda with vague suggestions about dealing with global issues -- there is a lot to discuss, including Afghanistan -- but insisted that the file on its nuclear efforts is closed.
 In the seven years since its covert nuclear fuel program was revealed, Iran has managed to split the world powers and deflect any real punishment by promising to talk. It continues to defy a United Nations Security Council order to stop producing nuclear fuel and has largely shrugged off three sets of watered-down sanctions that either failed to target Iran's economic vulnerabilities or were listlessly enforced -- especially by Russia and China.
 American and European officials say they are now developing a more persuasive list of sanctions if Tehran continues to resist; a ban on new energy investment in Iran and a possible cutoff of gasoline exports to Iran are two leading possibilities. If Washington and Europe cannot get Russia and the Security Council to go along, they must be ready to move on their own this time. 
 Most experts agree the Iran has already produced enough low-enriched uranium for at least one bomb, but they disagree -- often vigorously -- on how close Iran is to building an actual weapon. There is almost no disagreement on Iran's ultimate goal. Even the top nuclear inspector for the United Nations, Mohamed ElBaradei, who too often gives Iran the benefit of the doubt, has acknowledged a ''gut feeling'' that Tehran wants the technology to build a bomb. 
 Iran's economy is vulnerable. Unemployment and inflation are high; foreign investment is low. Banking sanctions imposed by the United Nations and separately by the United States and Europe have had some bite. The incentives package on offer from the major powers -- including an end to diplomatic isolation and carefully monitored cooperation on peaceful nuclear energy -- should be re-emphasized. Iranians need to see that there is a real choice. 
 Iran's stolen presidential elections and the brutal crackdown that followed has deepened fissures in Iranian society and complicated engagement. But President Obama is right to remain open to broader talks. 
 That is not meant to legitimize the government. If done deftly, it could undercut the mullahs' attempts to blame the United States for their own failures and make clear the price of continued obstructionism. 
 There is not a lot of time left for the world to forge a common position. The negative rumblings out of Russia -- which is again playing down the need for sanctions -- are disturbing. We are seriously worried about the growing drumbeat in Israel for military action. 
 An attack on Iran would be a disaster. So would allowing Iran to build a nuclear weapon. The United States should never have to choose between those two disastrous courses. If diplomacy shows promise, it should continue. But if Iran is playing the same old game, the major powers must be ready to impose a real economic price this time.

HEADLINE: U.S. to Accept Iran's Proposal To Hold Talks

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER and DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Obama administration said Friday that the United States would accept Iran's offer to meet, fulfilling President Obama's pledge to hold unconditional talks despite the Iranian government's insistence that it would not negotiate over the future of its nuclear program.
 The decision to engage directly with Iran would put a senior representative of the Obama administration at the bargaining table, along with emissaries from five other nations, for the first time since Mr. Obama took office. 
 The decision is bound to raise protests from conservatives who contend that unconditional talks are naive, and from human rights groups that say the United States should not legitimize an Iranian government that appears to have manipulated its presidential election in June and crushed protests after the vote.
 In advance of Friday's announcement, senior administration officials said that their offer to negotiate directly with the Iranians, for what could turn into the first substantive talks since the Iranian Revolution in 1979, was, as a senior official had earlier put it, a ''bona fide offer.''
 But at the same time, officials said their expectations were extremely low. They also said their willingness to proceed was based in part on a recognition that some form of talks had to take place before the United States could make a case for imposing far stronger sanctions on Iran.
 ''We'll be looking to see if they are willing to engage seriously on these issues,'' said a State Department spokesman, Philip J. Crowley. ''If we have talks, we will plan to bring up the nuclear issue.''
 The talks would also include Britain, France, Russia, China and Germany, which in the past have negotiated with Iran without the presence of an American representative, except for one meeting at the end of the administration of President George W. Bush. 
 During his first term, talks with unfriendly countries like North Korea and Iran were usually rejected out of hand in the hope of speeding their collapse. That loosened in Mr. Bush's second term, but even then agreements to talk were usually under highly restricted conditions.
 The result was a stalemate -- one that Mr. Obama argued during last year's presidential campaign was a huge mistake, in part because Iran was producing nuclear material while the standoff dragged on.
 The United Nations Security Council has issued several rounds of sanctions against Iran for failing to comply with resolutions demanding it stop enriching uranium. It has called on Tehran to answer questions from international arms inspectors about documents that suggest that the country worked in the past on a nuclear weapons design.
 Iran's government insists that its efforts are aimed at the peaceful generation of electricity, and has charged that the documents were Western forgeries.
 Iran made its offer to meet in a five-page letter delivered to several nations on Wednesday. Titled ''Cooperation, Peace and Justice,'' it touched on political, social and economic themes, called for reform of the United Nations and a Middle East peace settlement, and for universal nuclear disarmament.
 But the letter said nothing about Iran's nuclear program, and as recently as this week President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad vowed never to halt the fuel production, saying Iran would not relinquish its fundamental rights.
 Administration officials were dismissive of the letter, saying that it rehashed past statements and offers. But they said they would consider the offer to meet, and they spent less than 48 hours studying its contents before deciding to tell Iran that the United States would join its negotiating partners in talks.
 It is unclear where the discussions will take place, but the most likely American representative is William J. Burns, the under secretary of state for political affairs, who is leading the diplomatic effort.
 The first announcement of the decision was made Friday in Brussels by Javier Solana, the foreign policy chief of the European Union, who acts as an intermediary for the six countries.
 Hours earlier, the United States ambassador to the United Nations, Susan E. Rice, appeared to take a softer line on Iran, saying the administration would not impose ''artificial deadlines'' on Iran.
 It was difficult to judge Mr. Obama's outreach to Iran because, she said, ''the elections and their aftermath have added a layer of complexity to assessing the overtures and offers of diplomatic engagement.''
 Some administration officials argued that Mr. Obama's overtures, which included a videotaped New Year's greeting and at least one letter to Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamanei, had thrown the Iranian leadership off balance. They thought that for the first time in recent history, the United States had Iran on the defensive, rather than the other way around.
 Russia and China have expressed deep reservations about imposing additional sanctions on Iran. On Thursday, the Russian foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, expressed opposition to additional sanctions.
 On Friday, Mr. Crowley also said the United States would be willing to hold direct talks with North Korea over its nuclear program, within the context of existing six-party negotiations.
 ''We are prepared to meet with North Korea,'' he said. ''When it'll happen, where it'll happen, we'll have to wait and see.''

HEADLINE: Lehman Had to Die, It Seems, So Global Finance Could Live

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA

 BODY:
What if they'd saved Lehman Brothers?
 What if, a year ago this weekend, the government and the banking industry had somehow found a way to keep Lehman from filing for bankruptcy? How might that have changed the course of the financial crisis?
 We know, of course, what did happen; it is seared in our memory. On Monday, Sept. 15, 2008, when the news broke that, despite nonstop efforts that weekend, there would be no last-minute reprieve for Lehman, a la Bear Stearns, all hell broke loose. 
 The stock market tanked, dropping more than 500 points that day. The Reserve Primary Fund, a money market fund that held Lehman bonds, ''broke the buck.'' Shortly afterward, the American International Group nearly collapsed, and had to be bailed out with an extraordinary $85 billion loan from the government. Morgan Stanley was rumored to be next. Banks all over Europe were teetering. There were even fears about the stability of mighty Goldman Sachs. On Wall Street -- indeed, in financial capitals all over the Western world -- the panic was palpable. 
 Ever since that weekend, most people, including me, have viewed the decision by Henry Paulson Jr., the Treasury secretary at the time, and Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, to allow Lehman to go bust as the single biggest mistake of the crisis. Never mind that the two men have insisted ever since that they had no other option; surely, they could have created some options if they'd wanted to. Or so goes the conventional wisdom.
 Christine Lagarde, France's finance minister, for instance, called the decision ''horrendous'' and a ''genuine mistake.'' According to David Wessel, author of a book about the crisis, ''In Fed We Trust,'' the head of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, has said the same thing in private. He quotes one of Mr. Trichet's aides as saying, ''It never occurred to us that the Americans would let Lehman fail.'' In speeches and articles, in books and television appearances, commentators of every political stripe have pointed to the Lehman bankruptcy as the event that turned the subprime crisis into a full-blown financial collapse.
 As we approach this anniversary, though, I've begun to question that conventional wisdom. Yes, the fall of Lehman Brothers set off a contagion of panic. And I'm still convinced that Mr. Paulson and Mr. Bernanke could have found a way to save Lehman had they been so inclined (more on that in a moment). But I've become convinced that, if Lehman had been saved, the collapse would have occurred anyway. 
 John H. Makin, a visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, wrote recently, ''If the Lehman Brothers' failure had not triggered the panic phase of the cycle, some other institutional failure would have done so.'' I'll go a step further: it is quite likely that the financial crisis would have been even worse had Lehman been rescued. Although nobody realized it at the time, Lehman Brothers had to die for the rest of Wall Street to live.
 A week ago, a Reuters reporter traveled to Richard Fuld's vacation home in Ketchum, Idaho, to see if the former Lehman chief executive would say anything about the anniversary. (When Mr. Fuld walked outside to meet her, he said, ''You don't have a gun; that's good,'' according to the reporter.)
 Standing in his driveway, leading, as ever, with his chin, Mr. Fuld talked about the ''pummeling'' he had taken for presiding over the bankruptcy. ''They're looking for someone to dump on right now and that's me,'' he said. ''The facts are out there. Nobody wants to hear it, especially not from me,'' he added.
 Mr. Fuld's bitter remarks reflect the way many former Lehman executives feel, even now, about the fact that their firm was the only one to go under during the crisis. After all, they say, Lehman's mistakes -- too much leverage, an overreliance on shaky real estate assets, playing down the risks on its balance sheet -- were the same mistakes just about every firm made. Bear Stearns made those mistakes -- and was rescued. Citigroup made those mistakes -- and was rescued.
 What's more, they say, in the months and weeks leading up to the September crisis, the firm, realizing that it might need a Plan B, proposed that it be allowed to become a bank holding company. It also asked for access to the Fed's discount window, which is reserved for troubled banks. (What Lehman didn't do, however, despite the repeated urging of Mr. Paulson, was find a partner with deep pockets or raise additional capital.) These are the ''facts'' Mr. Fuld was referring to when he spoke the Reuters reporter. 
 But Timothy Geithner, then New York Fed president, now Treasury secretary, didn't like the idea of letting an investment bank become a bank holding company -- so he said no. Immediately after the Lehman default, however, that is exactly what he allowed Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs to do, which helped stabilize both firms. 
 Of course, politics played a role, too. Congress had no stomach for another bailout on the heels of the takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac just a week before Lehman weekend. In his book, Mr. Wessel, the economics editor of The Wall Street Journal, quotes Mr. Paulson as saying in a conference call, ''I'm being called Mr. Bailout. I can't do it again.'' 
 Although Mr. Paulson would later say that he had no legal authority to save Lehman Brothers, it seems pretty clear from Mr. Wessel's account that he wasn't really looking for any authority. He wanted to send a message. That Monday morning, in announcing the Lehman default, Mr. Paulson told the media: ''I never once considered that it was appropriate to put taxpayers' money on the line'' to save Lehman Brothers.
 For all of these reasons and more, former Lehman executives tend to feel that the process that led to the firm's bankruptcy was profoundly unfair. I've heard the word ''tragic'' more than once. And I agree with them: it was unfair -- and, certainly for the people who lost their jobs, even tragic. Lehman Brothers was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. But for the sake of the financial system, it was also the luckiest thing that could have happened.
 In the months between Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers, Mr. Paulson and Mr. Bernanke had approached Congressional leaders about the need to pass legislation that would give them a handful of additional tools to help them deal with a larger crisis, should one ensue. But they quickly realized there was simply no political will to get anything done. After Lehman, however, Mr. Paulson and Mr. Bernanke were able to persuade Congress to pass a bill that gave the Treasury Department $700 billion in potential bailout money -- which Mr. Paulson then used to shore up the system, and help ease the crisis. Even then, it wasn't easy; it took two tries in the House to pass the legislation. Without the crisis prompted by the Lehman default, it would have been impossible to pass a bill like that.
 That is one reason the Lehman default turned out to be a good thing. Here's another: If Lehman had been sold to Bank of America, as originally planned, some other firm -- no doubt bigger, and posing more danger to the global financial system -- would have failed instead. By then, there was simply too much panic in the air. A crisis of some sort was inevitable.
 Mr. Paulson, recall, wanted Wall Street to come up with its own solution for saving Lehman. But as the chief executives sat around the big conference table at the New York Fed all weekend, they kept worrying about who would be next. They talked openly aboutwhether Merrill Lynch could last much longer. (Mr. Paulson bluntly told John Thain, Merrill's chief executive, that he needed to find a buyer, which is why Bank of America turned its attention to Merrill and away from Lehman.) And there were rumblings that A.I.G. was in trouble. Why were they so reluctant to pitch in to save Lehman? They were worried that they might be next. 
 In truth, a Merrill or A.I.G. default would have created something akin to a financial nuclear bomb -- much worse than Lehman's filing for bankruptcy. Merrill was a much bigger firm, with deep roots on Main Street thanks to its ''thundering herd.'' A.I.G. was the world's largest insurance company, whose credit-default swaps were propping up half of Europe's banks. (By buying A.I.G.'s swaps, European banks could evade their capital requirements.) Lehman, by contrast, was a smaller firm, with practically no ties to Main Street. The risks it posed to the system were real -- but smaller. 
 Almost everyone I've ever spoken to in Hank Paulson's old Treasury Department agrees that without the immediate panic caused by the Lehman default, the government would never have agreed to make the loans needed to save A.I.G., a company it knew very little about. In effect, the Lehman bankruptcy caused the government to panic, which in turn caused it to save the firm it really had to save to prevent catastrophe. In retrospect, if you had to choose one firm to throw under the bus to save everyone else, you would choose Lehman. 
 It would be nice to be able to say that officials at Treasury and the Federal Reserve understood this at the time. But of course they didn't. Throughout history, people have stumbled their way through crises, not fully understanding the potential consequences of their actions, hoping the choices they make turn out to be the right ones.
 Mr. Bernanke is a well-known student of the Great Depression, which guided many of his actions during the crisis. Mr. Paulson showed immense tenacity once the crisis struck. History, I now believe, will praise their efforts in subduing the collapse. But the Lehman default?
 You know the old saying: Sometimes, it's better to be lucky than good. A year ago this weekend, it turns out, was one of those times.

HEADLINE: Finding Out How Safe Your Water Is and Improving It if Needed

BYLINE: By CORNELIA DEAN

 BODY:
Is your drinking water safe? That depends on several factors: the source; the treatment the water receives, if any; and the quality of the pipes in your home.
 According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Environmental Protection Agency, reports of Americans falling ill from drinking tap water are rare, and mostly involve people who are already in frail health. But it is not known how many people suffer unreported stomach upsets from bacterial contamination, or even more serious problems, like long-term exposure to contaminants like lead, from drinking tap water. 
 The Environmental Protection Agency regulates the community water systems that supply drinking water to most Americans. Every water system is required to publish a yearly ''consumer confidence report'' detailing contaminants or violations of water quality standards. You can see the report for your water system by contacting the system directly. To find your water system, visit www.epa.gov/enviro/html/sdwis/sdwis--query.html. 
 If your water comes from your own well, the E.P.A. advises that you test it annually, especially if you see signs of trouble like corroded pipes, strange odors or stained laundry. 
 Your municipality, county or state health department may offer free or low-cost testing services; otherwise, you can use a laboratory certified in your state. The E.P.A. has a list at www.epa.gov/safewater/labs/index.html. For further information on well water quality, the E.P.A. suggests consulting nonprofit groups like the American Ground Water Trust (www.agwt.org).
 Health departments can offer guidance to well owners on which contaminants to test for. Ask about the presence of radon or heavy metals like arsenic in underground rocks or soils. Tell the laboratory if you live near a farm, an industrial cattle-feeding operation, a gas station, a mine, a factory, a dump or any kind of operation that might produce contaminants that can find their way into ground water.
 If your water is contaminated, there are a few steps you can take.
 If the issue is corroded pipes in your home, consider replacing them. If your well is contaminated by bacteria, you can have it disinfected. (Be vigilant about testing in the future.) Or you can drill a deeper well. 
 For a few hundred dollars, you can install a ''point of entry'' system to filter contaminants, like heavy metals or bacteria, out of water where it enters your home. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the E.P.A. say such filters can help people whose immune systems are weakened by H.I.V., chemotherapy, steroid treatments or other factors. Some experts also recommend them for people who are very young, very old, pregnant or frail.
 A number of organizations, including Underwriters Laboratories (www.ul.com/global/eng/pages/) certify units that meet or exceed E.P.A. standards. 
 You can also use filters that can be attached to the tap or used in pitchers. They differ in quality and the contaminants they remove, so figure out what you need before you buy. Consumers Union, an independent testing organization, rates these filters (www.consumersunion.org). If you use these devices, you must be vigilant about replacing the filter components as scheduled. If you neglect this, even low levels of contaminants can collect in your filter, making it a potential trouble source. 
 One knotty issue is the presence in the water supply of residues from prescription drugs, personal care products like sunscreen or shampoo, or other substances that scientists call ''emerging contaminants.'' The E.P.A. says researchers have found these compounds in water almost everywhere they have looked. They attribute this to improved sensors as well as greater prevalence.
 Many of these substances seem impervious to water treatment regimes. But are they a problem for people? So far, that question remains unresolved.

HEADLINE: All the Giants of Finance Fell. 7 Stayed Down.

BYLINE: By KARL RUSSELL

 BODY:
WALL STREET'S landscape has been permanently altered. Lehman Brothers, gone. Bear Stearns, gone. Merrill Lynch, gone. Main Street's landscape has also been permanently altered. Wachovia, gone. National City, Washington Mutual and Countrywide, all gone. These venerable financial giants all crumbled under the weight of the financial crisis. Those that are left shrank down to a fraction of their former market capitalizations, but have all grown since then. Most are nowhere near their former size, but two, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, are slightly larger than they were at the market's peak in October 2007. 
 Many of the survivors were propped up by the government with billions of dollars in loans. And of the seven that are gone, some were bought by others in government-brokered deals.

HEADLINE: Loan Numbers a Touch Away

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
MANY home buyers align themselves with real estate agents who, while touring a home, can help to calculate a mortgage payment based on various negotiating strategies. 
 Now, with the proliferation of software applications for iPhones and BlackBerrys, these on-the-fly calculations can be replaced by more precise calculations. And the software programs are quite cheap, typically starting at $1.
 For those looking to refinance a loan, free online calculators offered by lenders and real estate companies might suffice. But for home shoppers, a mobile mortgage calculator brings instant and precise information to the process. Such aids certainly have become more commonplace. 
 David Daniels, a senior sales associate with the Corcoran Group, recalled seeing a young man tapping away on his BlackBerry last month, while his wife discussed possible sale prices for condominiums at Windows on 123, in Harlem. ''At first I thought he was just answering e-mails,'' Mr. Daniels said. ''But they were actually figuring out different scenarios of how much money to put down, and what their payment would be.
 ''It's much better as a buyer to see those numbers generated with your own calculations, rather than asking a broker who might guesstimate,'' he added. 
 Toni Habetz, an agent at Prudential Connecticut Realty, said that she had also observed clients using mobile mortgage calculators during house tours.
 ''Clients aren't as forthcoming about how much financial information they divulge,'' she said. ''And now they don't have to, because they can figure out the mortgage information for themselves.''
 These new applications are fairly straightforward calculators, but they can also include other information and features to help aid the mortgage decision.
 Take, for instance, the Mortgage Calculator Pro ($8 for BlackBerry users). After users enter a mortgage amount, interest rate, taxes, property insurance fees and preferred loan term, the program displays monthly payments. 
 It also supplies comparative results. The purple color-coded data refer to a submitted loan term, while orange results show what users would pay in interest and total loan payments for the life of the loan, if they instead choose different loan terms.
 Less helpful, but still interesting, is a feature that lets users type in a desired monthly payment and interest rate, and then determines how long it would take to pay off the mortgage.
 There is no way to provide a precise calculation, however, for those who will have to have private mortgage insurance, because they are not planning to make a down payment of at least 20 percent.
 Mortgage insurance rates vary so much that such calculations would be unreliable, said Gregory Raiz, the president of the Raizlabs Corporation in Brookline, Mass., which produces the Mortgage Calculator iPhone and iPod touch application ($1). The Mortgage Calculator is a good example of how the simpler mobile applications work. With sliders and data-entry fields, the software determines the monthly payment on a single screen.
 The program also allows users to type in the square footage of the property, for comparing different homes. Users may send the results of the calculation to themselves, with notes, as e-mail messages.
 There are dozens of other mortgage calculators available for iPhones, including the Mortgage Calculator Pro from SVT Software, the CalcsPro-Mortgage Calculators from Mortal Geek and Recalc from Anil Bajaj.
 These applications will have a limited impact, at least in the current market, according to Thomas Vanderwell, a mortgage officer at a bank who blogs at Straighttalkaboutmortgages.com about real estate.
 ''Anytime you can have exact information rather than ballpark information, that's a good thing,'' Mr. Vanderwell said. ''But in the last six to nine months, most buyers are cautious, and they don't move so fast that they need that information when they're looking at the house.''

THE HAWK AND THE DOVE
 Paul Nitze, George Kennan, and the History of the Cold War
 By Nicholas Thompson
 Illustrated. 403 pp. Henry Holt & Company. $27.50
 The end of the cold war brought relief, even joy, for most Americans. With the crumbling of the Eastern bloc in 1989, more than four decades of anxiety seemed to be over. One of the few discordant voices came, surprisingly, from George Kennan, the former United States diplomat who had devised the ''containment'' policy widely considered responsible for the Western triumph. ''I believe it would have happened earlier,'' Kennan lamented less than a month after Germans began chipping holes in the Berlin Wall, ''if we had not insisted on militarizing the rivalry.''
 Kennan did not specify who was responsible for making the cold war longer and more dangerous than it needed to be. But Paul Nitze, a onetime State Department colleague who had helped shape foreign policy under every president from Roosevelt to the first Bush, surely ranked high on his list of culprits. 
 It was Nitze, after all, who had argued most strongly for a huge buildup of American military power. And it was Nitze who had frequently led the charge to assure that Washington kept adding to its arsenal. Looking back in 1995, his appraisal of American management of the cold war could hardly have been more different from Kennan's. ''I've come to the conclusion we did it pretty goddam well,'' he boasted.
 Who was right? Did the United States put too much stock in military preparedness, unnecessarily antagonizing the Soviets while guaranteeing that the East-West rivalry would play out in the sole arena where Moscow could compete? Or did Americans act sensibly in response to a clear and present danger of Soviet aggression? Nicholas Thompson insists in ''The Hawk and the Dove,'' his thoroughly engrossing, if not altogether satisfying, dual biography of Nitze and Kennan, that both men had valid points. 
 ''Each was profoundly right at some moments and profoundly wrong at others,'' Thompson asserts of their long, intertwined careers as statesmen, policy makers and public intellectuals. The two men ''pulled in different directions'' but ''complemented each other'' and, Thompson suggests, contributed in distinct ways to America's victory in the cold war. They even managed to remain friends despite their differences.
 Thompson, an editor at Wired magazine, undertook the book partly for personal reasons. One of Nitze's 11 grandchildren, he enjoyed privileged access to his grandfather's papers, not to mention to Nitze himself before his death in 2004. Thompson possessed an obvious motive for shining a spotlight on a highly influential figure who never became a household name outside policy-making circles. 
 Yet the book is no mere tribute to a family patriarch. On the contrary, Thompson treats both his subjects critically, at times harshly, and recounts their lives with the broader purpose of illuminating the core debates that drove American policy making. Thompson succeeds admirably in blending biography and intellectual history, painting colorful portraits of complicated men who embodied conflicting strains of American thinking about foreign policy. 
 Kennan rose to prominence in 1946, when the Truman administration urgently wanted to understand the reasons for Soviet hostility to the West. The senior United States diplomat at the embassy in Moscow, Kennan offered eloquent and forcefully argued answers. Soviet belligerence sprang from a mix of Marxist ideology and old-fashioned power-mongering, he said. He then proposed that Washington adopt a policy not of directly confronting Moscow but of frustrating it by opposing Communists wherever they threatened to expand their influence beyond their borders. Over the long term, Kennan predicted, constant frustration would cause the Soviet system to mellow and then collapse.
 Thus was born the policy of containment, which became the cornerstone of national security for the rest of the cold war. Enthusiasm for Kennan's ideas catapulted him to public prominence and won him a job as head of the State Department's Policy Planning Staff, the group responsible for brainstorming about the broad contours of American diplomacy. Indeed, Kennan's achievements opened the way to a diverse career as ambassador to Moscow and Belgrade, government adviser, memoirist and Pulitzer-winning scholar of Russian history. 
 Yet, as Thompson emphasizes, acceptance of containment also brought Kennan disappointments that haunted him until his death in 2005. Kennan believed that the Soviet Union, however repugnant, posed little military threat to the West and urged that the United States rely mostly on economic and political means to resist Communist expansion. Other officials, above all Nitze, who succeeded Kennan as chief of policy planning, saw things differently, especially after the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950. Kennan watched with regret as the United States subsequently poured enormous resources into weaponry and military bases.
 Taking a darker view of Soviet intentions, Nitze tirelessly advocated that the United States maintain a sufficient edge in military hardware to deter attack or, in the worst case, to win a war. ''Nitze became,'' Thompson writes, ''something like a coach on the sidelines of a never-ending race, exhorting his athlete to run faster each time he completed a lap, whether ahead or behind.'' In the early 1950s, that meant supporting development of the hydrogen bomb. In the crisis-filled 1960s, it meant expanding the American arsenal to counter advances in Soviet weaponry. In the aftermath of the Vietnam War, it meant sounding the alarm about perceived American passivity. 
 Thompson is at his best in connecting these positions to the personalities of his two subjects. Kennan's wariness of military options sprang from deep pessimism about the capacity of technology to solve human problems and the ability of his fellow Americans to use power wisely. Nitze's policy preferences flowed from a far rosier outlook, a characteristic that Thompson attributes partly to a childhood much happier than Kennan's. Nitze possessed boundless faith in material progress and confidence in Americans' ability to effect constructive change abroad.
 Thompson falters only in some of his attempts to step back from his rich detail and sum it all up. Curiously, the ''hawk'' and ''dove'' labels do not encapsulate the key differences between Nitze and Kennan especially well. Though Kennan feared nuclear weapons, he was no dove when it came to assessing Stalinist Russia in the 1940s. For his part, Nitze sometimes acted less than hawkish. Like Kennan, he opposed American intervention in Vietnam, and in 1982 he shocked his colleagues by tentatively agreeing with a Soviet counterpart to eliminate an entire category of nuclear weapons, a deal so dovish for its time that it was quickly rejected by both Washington and Moscow. Better labels would be ''realist'' and ''liberal internationalist,'' which, though hardly the stuff of a catchy title, capture the core distinction between Kennan's insistence on the limits of American capabilities and Nitze's more optimistic view. 
 It is also difficult to accept Thompson's too pat argument that the rivals achieved a productive symbiosis that helped end the cold war, Kennan by providing the basic strategy and Nitze by helping make the tactical decisions that brought victory. Such a judgment naturally necessitates discussion of decision making on the Soviet side. Did American military buildups provoke Moscow, as Kennan worried, or deter it, as Nitze maintained? Might the Soviets have responded positively to a different mix of American policies? Without answers to such questions, any claim about Kennan's and Nitze's impact must remain speculative.

HEADLINE: New Chapter for Moscow's Toy Story

BYLINE: By MARIANNA TISHCHENKO

DATELINE: MOSCOW 

 BODY:
Detsky Mir, a landmark here in the heart of Russia's capital, was once one of the largest children's stores in Europe, with a central atrium that had elegant balustrades, columns and elevator shafts.
 Generations of Muscovites and visitors have adored Detsky Mir, which means ''children's world'' in Russian. Everything from baby clothes to toys to bobby pins has been sold in the store. Located not far from the Kremlin, Detsky Mir opened in 1957 and became a symbol not only of Soviet architecture but also of the Soviet era itself.
 But the store is now closed while it undergoes an estimated $200 million renovation to its interior. The project is raising concerns among preservationists that it could become the latest of the city's architectural treasures to fall victim to commercial pressures. 
 Over the summer, the Moscow Architecture Preservation Society released a report asserting that in recent years numerous historically significant buildings, including some that should have been protected under the law, were demolished or scarred in renovations.
 The report warned that as city officials rushed to develop in the post-Soviet era, Moscow is in danger of repeating the mistakes of major European and American cities in the 1960s, when worthy buildings were wiped out in a construction spree. And while the pace of development in Moscow has slowed because of the financial crisis, it is likely to resume when the economy picks up.
 ''Today, there is no other capital city in peacetime Europe that is being subjected to such devastation for the sake of earning a fast megabuck,'' Natalya Dushkina, an architect and historian, wrote in the report. She is the granddaughter of Aleksei Dushkin, the architect who designed Detsky Mir.
 The report expressed concern that Detsky Mir and several other well-known structures, including the Bolshoi Theater, could face significant damage during current and planned construction projects. Entitled ''Moscow Heritage at Crisis Point,'' the report is an updated version of a 2007 assessment that sounded alarms about historic buildings.
 The architecture society said the original report was influential, helping to compel the municipal government and developers to be more aware of buildings at risk.
 ''I don't think we, on our own, can bring about the changes needed,'' said Edmund Harris, a Briton who lives in Moscow and was one of the primary authors of the latest report. ''The most important thing is to make people aware.''
 The architecture society was established in 2004 after the demolition of a famed 1930s hotel, the Moskva, caused an outcry. Some here said that the demolition had a galvanizing effect for Russian preservationists, similar to what occurred in the United States after the destruction of the old Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan in the 1960s.
 The issues involving renovations in general are highly contentious, involving competing visions for the city's future and, of course, the sizable profits that can be earned in real estate. Last year, a government-controlled television network spiked a documentary on the threats to Moscow's historic buildings that highlighted some of the work of the architecture society.
 While city officials in Moscow often come under criticism from preservationists, they responded to the new report by saying that they were making strides in protecting buildings.
 ''We're investing a lot of money in a historical analysis of all objects in historical neighborhoods,'' said Valery Shevchuk, who leads the city's building conservation panel. ''Everything will be calculated, analyzed and written up, so we will know where it's possible to renovate, where new construction projects are possible.''
 Mr. Shevchuk said the committee had stopped more than 100 projects in the past two years to prevent damage and demolition to landmarks even though it had cost the city hundreds of millions of dollars.
 At Detsky Mir, the developer, Sistema-Hals, emphasized that it would not demolish the external structure of the building, but said the inside needed extensive renovations.
 ''The internal space is outdated in every sense and does not meet modern safety requirements for shopping complexes,'' said a spokeswoman for Sistema-Hals, Anna Zavyalova.
 Still, preservationists said they worried that without vigilance, the government might look the other way and developers would have a free hand.
 ''Cultural legacy is always a last priority,'' said Tatyana Weinstein, a prominent Russian architect.

HEADLINE: Japan's Victors Warily Prepare for Power

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
As the newly elected Democratic Party works to assemble what will be only the second government in Japan's postwar history not to be led by the Liberal Democratic Party, it is treading carefully to avoid infighting that could split the ideologically diverse party or drive a wedge between it and its coalition allies.
 Since smashing the Liberal Democrats' nearly uninterrupted half-century monopoly on power two weeks ago, the center-left Democrats and their leader, Yukio Hatoyama, 62, have hurried to fill top posts in the party and his incoming cabinet and to cobble together a coalition with other parties before their government's formal accession to power on Sept. 16. 
 The party is working under unrelenting scrutiny from the news media and from Japanese citizens still affected by the bitter aftertaste of their only previous experience with non-Liberal Democratic rule since 1955. That government, which took power in 1993, lasted less than a year before collapsing amid bickering and defections.
 Nightly news broadcasts, which are dominated by detailed coverage of the political maneuverings within the newly formed coalition, frequently feature veterans of the earlier failed government who offer lessons from their brief, rocky time in power. 
 While there have been no major bumps so far, warning signs are already appearing.
 On Wednesday, when Mr. Hatoyama and the heads of two smaller anti-laissez-faire parties, the Social Democratic Party and the People's New Party, agreed to form a coalition government, they left unresolved disagreements over the status of 50,000 American service members in Japan. Mr. Hatoyama has spoken in vague terms of re-examining the American military bases, while still trying to remain close to Washington, but the leftist Social Democrats want the bases removed.
 There have also been signs of division in the Democratic Party since Mr. Hatoyama gave a top party position to one of the party's most powerful men, Ichiro Ozawa, in what analysts say was an attempt to keep his loyalty. But in doing so, Mr. Hatoyama raised concerns by other Democrats that the party was embracing a shadowy kingmaker whose money-oriented political style closely resembled that of the Liberal Democrats they defeated. 
 Those critics fear that Mr. Ozawa, 67, will compete with Mr. Hatoyama for control of the party; Mr. Ozawa was a member of the 1993-1994 government, and political analysts have blamed his clashes with other coalition members for contributing to its demise. On Thursday, many Democrats lobbied to have Seiji Maehara, a young proponent of clean politics, included in the new cabinet to help offset Mr. Ozawa's influence.
 Mr. Hatoyama has tried to dispel concerns that he is creating competing centers of power. 
 ''This will not create a dual power structure,'' Mr. Hatoyama, the presumptive next prime minister, told reporters. He added that policy would be set by his cabinet and not the party.
 Still, the barest hints of fissures within the party have made news in a nation keen to see if the Democrats can pull off the daunting task of essentially dragging the country into a true multiparty system. 
 The 1993-94 government, which included eight small parties and groups and was first led by Morihiro Hosokawa as prime minister, lasted only 11 months. Its quick collapse drove disappointed Japanese voters back into the arms of the Liberal Democrats, where they stayed until the election.
 While there are many differences between now and 1993 -- the biggest being the fact that a single, large party, the Democratic Party, has beaten the Liberal Democrats -- the mistakes of that earlier government still cast a shadow, according to veterans of that coalition.
 ''It took 16 years to get this second chance,'' Mr. Hosokawa, who retired from politics in 1998, said in an interview. ''Lack of cohesiveness has always plagued efforts to build a second big political party.''
 Mr. Hosokawa said the Democrats' main weak point might be their broad manifesto of campaign promises, which would be hard to achieve quickly enough to satisfy Japan's recession-weary voters. The party is trying to reinvigorate Japan's sclerotic system of government by empowering elected politicians and consumers over the bureaucracy and industry, and to blunt the pain from globalization with a stronger social safety net.
 Instead, Mr. Hosokawa said, focusing on a few high-profile policies would make it easier to keep the party on the same track and offer voters results. 
 ''They need a single flag to stand under,'' he said.
 Adding to the difficulty will be the fact that Mr. Hatoyama heads a party that is broad and often hazy in its identity. 
 The party was formed in 1998 as a motley grouping of former Socialists and defectors from the conservative Liberal Democratic Party. Since then, it has tried to forge a unique culture and identity, with mixed success.
 By finally winning power, the party has been robbed of its main source of unity, say political analysts and former politicians. The glue that held the Democrats together has been a shared desire to end the Liberal Democrats' rule. 
 ''The Democrats are like wet, unformed concrete, which still lacks a mold,'' said Atsuo Ito, an independent political analyst who wrote a book on the party. ''Just holding power may be enough to keep the party together at first, but eventually the party will need shared beliefs to keep from flying apart.''

HEADLINE: Business Moves Home

BYLINE: By SARAH MASLIN NIR

 BODY:
WHEN Janet Bushor's roommate moved out of the two-bedroom apartment they shared on the Upper West Side of Manhattan last year, Ms. Bushor installed a new resident: an eight-foot-long ballet barre. 
 Ms. Bushor, 47, is a former musical theater dancer turned personal trainer. She has made her living space into a one-bedroom with a workout studio, and now charges $75 an hour to teach her mostly female clientele to squat, thrust and plie at weekly one-on-one sessions. 
 Unlike conventional gyms, there is no membership fee, so, Ms. Bushor says, her clients save money. But she saves, too, because she does not have to give a percentage of her fee to an employer, as personal trainers who work out of sports clubs often must. There's also the boon of being your own boss. At gyms, ''they want you to stand by the machine and count,'' she says. At home, ''I do my own thing.'' 
 As long as there have been homes, there have been home businesses. And for almost as long, there have been leases, landlords and laws that frowned upon home businesses. But in a challenging economy, more people are resorting to relocating businesses from shop fronts or other commercial spaces to spots under their own roofs. Others are starting businesses at home after losing jobs. 
 ''With these economic pressures, people are trying to find creative ways to pay their rent,'' said Jaya Madhavan, a supervising judge of Bronx Housing Court, where innovative rent-paying measures that run afoul of leases can wind up. 
 Landlords are often unaware that their tenants are operating home businesses; such enterprises come to the housing court's attention only when a landlord catches on and decides to take steps to evict the offending tenant. In-house businesses wind up in still other courts when city statutes -- like plumbing regulations and occupancy rules -- are violated.
 The number of shingles hanging inside apartment doors is difficult to say.
 ''It's impossible to quantify just how many people are newly engaging in home businesses,'' said Ernesto Belzaguy, the first deputy chief clerk of the Civil Court of New York City, of which housing courts are a part. Courts don't keep a record of these sorts of cases. 
 When questioned via e-mail message, 10 New York City Housing Court judges said they saw no discernible uptick in cottage industry evictions. 
 But Judge Madhavan said that pragmatic landlords are very likely turning a blind eye and staying away from housing court. ''There is a lot of it going on, and there are landlords that are aware of it but are keeping quiet about it, because they recognize that it's a way for a tenant to pay their rent,'' he said. 
 Ms. Bushor said she didn't believe that her landlord or her neighbors are aware of her business, because she sees only 7 to 10 clients in her apartment once or twice a week. Before her roommate's departure, Ms. Bushor worked in her clients' homes or in fitness facilities.
 The layout of the apartment, a duplex, has also helped her to avoid making waves. Her new gym is on the floor above her bedroom, rather than above her neighbors' heads. Living on the first floor of a nondoorman walk-up building helps, too. ''It's not like there is a doorman, or I am on the fourth floor so they are passing everyone on the stairs,'' she said.
 Operating a business in your apartment can be a simple lease violation, or illegal and in violation of city codes. Businesses that have a constant stream of foot traffic -- hair salons, masseuses -- often violate reasonable-use clauses in lease agreements. An eBay-type sales business might also be a problem if there's continual shipping and delivery. 
 It is notoriously difficult to be evicted in New York, but if taken to court and found in breach of a lease, a tenant is typically given 10 days to cure, or stop, the problem, or face eviction. 
 ''Landlords and co-op boards are very protective of the other tenants' privacy, as well as protecting their buildings against people coming in and coming out without security,'' said Gary J. Wachtel, a lawyer who specializes in landlord-tenant disputes. 
 Even at-home dog groomers or cat boarders can run into trouble with their leases. ''Foot traffic not only could be foot traffic but animal traffic, too,'' Mr. Wachtel said. ''Paw traffic.'' 
 Some businesses are flat-out illegal, Judge Madhavan said. 
 One tenant who ran a nightclub out of his apartment, for example, violated city rules against overcrowding. Tinkering with the plumbing (adding more toilets) or the gas (to cook commercially) can be considered a nuisance, and can be dangerous. 
 ''Someone decides that they need an industrial stove with six burners, but the gas supply is designed for residential use,'' Judge Madhavan said. ''It's a real threat.''
 Residents who modify utilities for commercial use or who cause overcrowding in an apartment face stiff penalties. If the landlord decides to take them to court, they may be found guilty of nuisance violations, and are given no option to cure the situation. Eviction proceedings could start immediately. 
 Penalties like fines depend on whether a fine is stipulated in the lease. 
 But in actual practice, tenants convicted of a nuisance violation are frequently given a second chance, a probation period in which they agree not to continue the activity. Often, said Glenn H. Spiegel, a partner at Finkelstein Newman Ferrara who has handled these types of cases, these tenants are required to pay the landlord's legal fees.
 The type of building can play a part in how long a home-based entrepreneur can evade detection, Mr. Spiegel said. ''Depending on what the specific rules are for a condominium and co-op, the condominium or co-op may have an easier time restricting the use of a particular apartment,'' he said. ''The courts are more apt to enforce the co-op or the condo's house rules.'' 
 Some home businesses are so small that they might be considered, disturbance-wise, less bothersome to others than a supersized stroller parked in a hallway. 
 A year and a half ago, Seth Adler, 33, an event producer, realized his dream of becoming a voice-over actor by creating an in-house sound studio in the closet of his one-bedroom apartment in the East Village. 
 Because the business is self-contained and clients do not come to visit, Mr. Adler believes he is operating within the scope of his lease. And though his business required some home modification, he said he doesn't think he violated any city codes. He simply stapled panels of sound-blocking egg-crate foam from floor to ceiling in the small closet.
 In this homemade studio, Mr. Adler uses his honeyed voice to create 30-second advertising spots. Each earns a couple of hundred dollars, he says. 
 Were he to use a professional recording studio space, which can cost around $500 per session, he says, ''there's a good shot that I would make no money.'' 
 Though Mr. Adler's voice-over work is a side pursuit in addition to his full-time job, having a home business has helped ease financial worries. 
 ''Around the third quarter of 2008, we all got extremely nervous,'' he said. ''Knowing that I had a couple of irons in the fire certainly made me rest at least a little bit easier.'' 
 Not all examples are as low-impact as Mr. Adler's.
 A 28-year-old renter in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, says his landlord has no idea that he sometimes records and mixes aspiring hip-hop artists and rappers in the living room of the apartment that he shares with his mother and two siblings.
 Though he used to have periodic work helping with crowd control at events like the Barneys warehouse sale, he said the jobs stopped coming last February. For the last six months, recording and producing would-be singers and rap stars at the rate of $20 an hour -- Mr. Adler says a professional recording studio can cost more than 10 times as much -- has been his sole source of income, roughly $10,000 a year. 
 He said customers accept the unusual setting because of the rock-bottom price and his product. ''They are usually cool with it after they hear the sound quality,'' he said. ''They are like, 'I did not expect that from the setup.' '' 
 Stacy Pitt's home hairstyling business was so profitable that she was able to move it three months ago from the rent-stabilized studio that she shares with her boyfriend in the East Village to another studio in a nearby residential building. Her combined rent is $2,100 a month. 
 She decided to rent the second studio after a year and a half of searching for a neighborhood storefront turned up only small spaces with rents of $4,000 to $6,000 per month, far beyond her budget. Renting a pricey space, she said, would force her to charge much more for her services and might cause her to lose her clients.
 ''I didn't want my clients to have to pay for me wanting more room,'' she said. 
 Ms. Pitt, who starts her day of $70 highlights and $35 to $45 haircuts at 7 a.m. and keeps snipping until 9 p.m. or later six days a week, said her business has boomed as the recession closed in because clients are looking for a cheaper alternative to a salon.
 Ms. Pitt said she now earns more than she did as a salon stylist. Then, the house took 50 percent of her earnings, an industry standard. She also charges less than her clients are used to, because of the low overhead of the apartment setting. 
 Salon owners do not appreciate that distinction.
 ''It is a serious drain on the business community,'' said Joseph Strafaci, the owner of Joseph Martin Salon on East 57th Street in Manhattan. ''Every downturn, every retraction, those individuals who do freelance work swoop in. Businesses can't compete with individuals who have no operating expenses.''
 Though Ms. Pitt opened a home salon out of necessity, the apartment aesthetic is now part of the hook. The studio where she cuts hair features a fold-out bed. 
 Clients get their hair washed in the kitchen sink.
 The apartment setting, she said, gives the salon an indie, underground cachet. Customers, she observed, ''loved the kitschy-ness of it.''
 ''It was a very cool thing for them; everyone likes to feel like they found something,'' Ms. Pitt said. ''Like they found a little secret.''

HEADLINE: Big Spenders? They Wish

BYLINE: By PETER S. GOODMAN

 BODY:
Millions of Americans have lost homes, jobs and savings to the financial crisis and recession. While greed and extravagance played roles, many lived beyond their means because their paychecks shrank. This article is adapted from ''Past Due: The End of Easy Money and the Renewal of the American Economy,'' by Peter S. Goodman, a reporter for The New York Times. The book, to be published Tuesday by Times Books, explores the origins of the crisis and suggests ways to reinvigorate the economy.
 ONE afternoon in November 2006, a policeman spotted an expired license plate on Dorothy Thomas's 10-year-old Toyota Corolla as she drove through San Jose, Calif. He ordered her to pull over. 
 Struggling under the weight of thousands of dollars in credit card bills, Ms. Thomas was perpetually short of cash. She had not bought a $10 auto registration sticker. The officer checked his database and recognized that she had already been ticketed once before for the same thing. He arranged to have her car towed away. 
 ''I got down on my knees and begged that officer,'' Ms. Thomas recalled.
 As she watched her car being hauled off, she sensed that this was the beginning of a descent into a crisis from which she might not easily escape. Without money to pay the towing and storage fees, she could not extract her car from the lot, and the tab soon grew to $1,600. Without a car, she could not reach the hospital where she worked in the administrative offices, so she lost her $16-an-hour job. Without a paycheck, she could no longer pay the rent on her modest home. She moved to Oakland, where a friend lived in a beaten-down, rented house on a street they called Crack Avenue. By year's end, Ms. Thomas, then 49, was occupying a bunk at a homeless shelter, searching in vain for a job in an economy plagued by unemployment. 
 Across the United States a sense has taken hold that the Great Recession and the financial crisis are predominantly a result of national profligacy, as if the economy had been undone by insatiable shoppers, foolhardy home buyers and greedy investment bankers. Extravagance and recklessness certainly played crucial roles, and yet they are only part of the explanation. 
 Many have lived beyond their incomes simply because incomes have been outstripped by the costs of middle-class life. By the fall of 2008, most American workers were bringing home roughly the same weekly wages they had earned in 1983, after accounting for inflation. 
 ''For middle- and low-wage workers, the median wage basically went nowhere over these years,'' said the economist Jared Bernstein. 
 Spirited and eloquent, Ms. Thomas had worked her way up from rural Oklahoma poverty, enduring the strains of forcibly integrated schools, before settling in California. She had become one of the first African-Americans to sell cosmetics at a Sacramento department store. Then, she forged a career in medical billing, at one point making $22 an hour. She had lived beyond her means, but not out of decadence. For years, she had rented homes in better neighborhoods than she could afford in order to send her two daughters to quality schools. She had run up credit card balances to pay for summer science camps and school supplies. She had never earned more than a high school diploma, but one of her daughters already had a master's in education; the other was about to start college.
 ''I truly bought into the idea that education is the way out of poverty,'' Ms. Thomas said. ''If your kids are going to school with kids who are preprogrammed to go to college, then that's what they will expect. I didn't get myself out of poverty. But I got my daughters out. I was the bridge.''
 Long before ''subprime'' entered the American lexicon, before Wall Street convulsed with the collapse of giant institutions and the financial world seized with fear, a slower-moving crisis was already under way for tens of millions of ordinary people like Ms. Thomas. The shock of recent times has merely intensified this deeper crisis, rendering void a mode of living that was already unsustainable. 
 As wages stagnated, and as the costs of health care and education spiraled higher, easy money filled the gap: shrinking paychecks were masked by an explosion of consumer credit and by a pair of investment manias that made money surge through the American economy -- one centered on the supposedly limitless promise of the Internet, the other propelled by faith that real estate values could only climb. 
 On the backs of these fantasies, the financial system lent out ridiculous sums of money to businesses and homeowners, as if the laws of supply and demand had been repealed.
 Americans became addicted to dreaming up the Next Big Thing, telling one another stories that seemed to justify pouring money into stocks, real estate and exotic new investments. A nation skilled in innovation and craftsmanship relinquished its traditional focus on engineering goods and services of intrinsic value in favor of financial make-believe, mostly unchecked by government regulation. 
 As exotic mortgages proliferated along with inscrutable investments backed by home payments, respected leaders like Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, and Robert E. Rubin and Lawrence H. Summers -- both Treasury secretaries in the Clinton administration -- silenced those inclined to damp the festivities with limits on how much money financial institutions could put into play. 
 Bankers operating freely would assess risks better than bureaucrats, they counseled, enabling gold rush fever to flourish on Wall Street and in every suburban cul-de-sac, while the consequences of failure swelled to monstrous proportions.
 ''Proposals to bring even minimalist regulation were basically rebuffed by Greenspan and various people in the Treasury,'' recalled Alan S. Blinder, who served with Mr. Greenspan on the board of governors at the Federal Reserve.
 Easy money generated economic growth and spread riches. Yet when arithmetic reasserted itself, annihilating trillions of dollars in wealth and millions of jobs, the economy was left with a debilitating case of disillusionment: once markets lost faith in make-believe, they starved the economy of capital. Even people who had barely benefited -- people like Dorothy Thomas -- suffered an outsize share of hurt. 
 The challenge now confronting American society is how to transition from an era in which we spent and consumed in brazen disregard of traditional limits into a new period in which we live on what we bring home from work. Yet just as Americans most need jobs to rebuild savings and pay off past-due bills, jobs are in exceedingly scarce supply. 
 ''If you had told me before that a person could look for a year and not find a job, I'd have said they were just lazy,'' Ms. Thomas said. ''Every day, I feel like I'm losing a piece of myself.'' 
 BY early 2008, the electricity and water had been cut for lack of payment at the house on Crack Avenue. For Ms. Thomas, 12 months had passed without work, despite dozens of applications at medical billing offices -- those she could reach without a car. One potential employer rejected her after she failed a credit check.
 ''They're saying that credit is a reflection of your character,'' she said, choking back tears.
 The confident young woman who had once sold expensive cosmetics had become a middle-aged woman bulging out of sweat pants, her face sagging with exhaustion, her hair matted for lack of access to a shower. Each rejection intensified her fears that she might never work again. 
 ''Is it my age?'' she asked. ''Is it because I've gained weight?'' She had been visiting a nearby food bank. ''They give us cakes and cookies,'' she said. ''Then you wonder why poor people are fat! They're not giving us fruits and vegetables.'' 
 She riffled through a folder, proffering her resume -- evidence that she belonged in the white-collar world. ''I'm articulate,'' she said, shifting into the smooth tones of a receptionist as she pantomimed answering the phone. ''How may I direct your call?'' 
 ''When you get discouraged, it's hard to recover,'' she said. ''People who aren't poor, it's as if they think we don't know what our lives are like and what's happening to us. But we know. Poverty is like a prison without bars.''
 Three months later, the crumbling house on Crack Avenue fell into foreclosure, and Ms. Thomas was forced out. She thought of asking her oldest daughter for help. But her daughter was struggling to pay her own bills on a teacher's salary. So Ms. Thomas checked into a homeless shelter for battered women and substance abusers. She pretended to be a drug addict in order to stay, using the free bed as an opportunity to reconstruct her life.
 In November, she got a job scheduling appointments for a chain of medical clinics for $16 an hour. She could reach the offices using public transportation. She wore a crisp white blouse and a neat ponytail. Her face radiated calm. 
 ''I feel so good,'' she said, ''because I feel so normal.''
 A long stretch of hopelessness had given way to the outlines of a future. A few weeks later, she had saved $1,600. Soon, she bought a used car, a Toyota Rav 4, which greatly expanded her field of potential workplaces. Another few months of work and saving and she figured to have enough to recover her independence.
 But in late January this year, with the economy still deteriorating, her new employer laid her off.
 ''That first week, I really slipped under,'' she said. ''I did feel suicidal. I just felt so knocked off the block. To lose that job was just devastating.'' 
 She was sobbing. 
 ''I'm back at Square One,'' she said.
 MUCH the same might be said of the American economy. Many experts say it may take years to fully recover, creating enough decent-paying jobs so that paychecks can replace home equity loans and credit cards as fuel for spending. ''The open question is whether we're in for a bad couple of years, or a bad decade,'' said Kenneth S. Rogoff, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund.
 As attention focuses on how best to nurture good jobs, many advocate increased government investment into research institutions to spur innovation, in addition to tax incentives for private ventures that turn the resulting know-how into businesses. Renewable energy and biotechnology exemplify how such public-private partnerships have already produced jobs. Amid mounting concerns about climate change, states are compelling utilities to buy energy from clean sources, creating new markets for wind power and solar energy. 
 Iowa is exploiting its position on the Great Plains -- the so-called Saudi Arabia of wind -- to manufacture wind turbines. Toledo's glass factories, confronting declining orders for auto windshields, are focused on making solar panels. North Carolina has twinned the brainpower of its research universities with its engineering prowess to construct a thriving hub of biotechnology, employing people laid off from tobacco and textiles. 
 These are merely examples of one fruitful approach to creating jobs, say economists, one that may be applied to myriad other areas of American industry. Silicon Valley remains a hotbed of valuable thinking. Wall Street -- much maligned though it may be -- retains important skills that await incentives to make it function in the national interest. 
 Some argue that the Next Big Thing may not be big at all, but rather a diffuse process of innovation unleashed on established areas of the economy, one that extracts greater value by improving goods and services we already use every day. Traffic-choked cities may be liberated with modernized public transportation. Homes may be made more comfortable with advances in furnishing. The great American capacity to engineer solutions to life's problems -- still intact -- may need only the right policies to flourish again.
 ''There's a lot of opportunities for change in existing industries,'' says Joe Cortright, an economist at Impresa, a consulting firm in Portland, Ore., where traditional agriculture has in recent years evolved into boutique wineries and specialty-vegetable growers, extracting far greater value.
 We are only now beginning to emerge from the longest recession since the Great Depression. The economy remains alarmingly lean. Yet many see in this moment an opportunity to refocus on areas of economic strength. 
 This month, amid reports that businesses were beginning to receive new orders, Dorothy Thomas was still living in a homeless shelter, unemployed. 
 Before the end of the month, she will reach the shelter's time limit and be forced to move again. Yet, a new confidence was evident in her words. After nearly two years of rejection and terrifying proximity to the streets, she had tapped back into a deep resilience. She had polished her resume, acquired a penchant for saving and secured transportation. All that sat between her desperation and renewal was an item that -- in the traditional American narrative -- was supposed to be available to anyone willing to work: a paycheck. 
 ''A job,'' Ms. Thomas said, ''is really all I need.''

BYLINE: By ALICE RAWSTHORN

 BODY:
What do the names Charles and Ray Eames mean to you? Chairs, chairs and more chairs? Not any old chairs, though, but great ones, as the Eameses were among the best furniture designers of the 20th century. 
 They didn't just do furniture, however. The couple designed everything from toys, games, houses, books and movie sets to leg splints for the United States Navy. They also found time to pursue parallel careers as educational filmmakers. Some of their films were so clever, especially when it came to demystifying math and science to the 99 percent of Americans without a doctorate in either subject, that the films and not the chairs are celebrated among the academically blessed 1 percent. 
 Arguably the smartest of the Eameses' films is ''Powers of Ten,'' one of the most successful attempts to explain science to the layman in any medium. According to Adam Bly, the editor in chief of the science magazine Seed, it remains ''fresh, intelligent, revolutionary and timeless: a pinnacle of scientific communication.'' 
 When the Eameses made the film in 1977, they were hoping to demonstrate: a) the power of a number (no prizes for guessing which one); and b) the relative size of the universe. It starts with a scene of a couple picnicking near Lake Michigan in Chicago. When the man falls asleep, the camera is positioned one meter above him in a one-meter-square shot. Every 10 seconds, it moves 10 times farther away -- to 10 meters, 100 meters and so on. After 70 seconds, we can see the earth's diameter, and 60 seconds later, the entire solar system. The camera stops on the outer edge -- 100 million light-years away from the picnic -- before zooming back to the man's hand. The film then explores the negative powers of 10 starting with one square centimeter of skin, a white blood cell, a chromosome, its DNA, and ending with the nucleus of an atom. The round trip through the universe to the center of that atom happens in a single shot lasting just eight minutes. 
 So far, so geeky. But ''Powers of Ten'' towers over other tutorials not just because the Eameses were great communicators (an essential attribute for any designer) but also because, by 1977, they had become seriously good filmmakers. They'd made more than 100 films, including two in preparation for ''Powers of Ten'': 1963's ''Truck Test,'' to try out the continuous moving shot, and 1968's ''Rough Sketch,'' a shorter, black and white version of the final work. Having lived in L.A. since 1941, they could count on the help of movie friends, like the director Billy Wilder and the Oscar-winning composer Elmer Bernstein, who scored many of their films.
 Another reason for the film's success is that the science is spot on. The Eameses worked closely with the Commission on College Physics and with Kees Boeke, the Dutch educator whose 1957 book, ''Cosmic View,'' inspired the film. Each image is clearly explained by the narrator, and the Eameses' delight in the scale and richness of the universe is reflected in the film's drama and beauty. It inspires a scientific simpleton, like me, to learn more, while presenting a seductive vision of science to the cognoscenti. ''The Eameses brought childlike curiosity, honesty and humility to the age-old question of our place in our universe,'' Bly said. ''It reminds us of a bigger picture that connects all of science and scientists.''
 That picture seems particularly appealing to us now at a time of information overload, when our lives are increasingly complex. Designers and computer programmers are trying to help us make sense of it all by experimenting with new digital media. One of the most exciting developments is Processing, a program that helps crunch huge quantities of data and translate them into luscious, easily digestible digital images. Those images are already used by speakers at cool conferences, like TED, to explain new scientific theories, and by statistics teams at The New York Times to demystify economic and social trends.
 Bly is teaming up with Paola Antonelli, the senior curator of architecture and design at the Museum of Modern Art, to remake ''Powers of Ten'' using Processing and other new technologies. They reckon that's what the Eameses would have done if they were trying to unravel the mysteries of science for us today. ALICE RAWSTHORN

HEADLINE: Soap Opera Star Forsakes New York

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
THE recession has been pinching the real estate market in New York, in ways both obvious and mysterious. Last month, ABC announced that the long-running soap opera ''All My Children'' would move to studios in Los Angeles, after 40 years of production in New York. 
 And so actors and staff members are exploring the intricacies of bicoastal life, or are preparing to give up their New York apartments and houses for a new life on the West Coast. 
 Cameron Mathison, who plays Ryan Lavery, a tragic hero and one-time con man, has put his modernist brownstone on West 130th Street, in Harlem, on the market for $2.7 million. 
 Mr. Mathison said it was a sad time in New York television production history, but an opportunity for Manhattan home buyers, in particular for a buyer interested in his 20-foot-wide brownstone, which has a garden dominated by a Buddha statue. 
 ''It is a tricky situation,'' he said. ''We envisioned being in this place forever, but in order to keep my job on 'All My Children,' we have to pack it up and move across the country.''
 Mr. Mathison and his wife, Vanessa, discovered Harlem almost by accident. After the birth of their first child, they began to look for a larger apartment on the West Side, but found prices outrageously high, even before considering co-op and condominium monthly charges. 
 They saw an ad for a brownstone, spent a weekend roaming a neighborhood that Mr. Mathison had never visited before, and decided it would be a great place to live. ''It reminded me of 'Sesame Street,' '' he said. ''There were people sitting out the stoops, kids playing in the street. It felt like we were in the suburbs, but still in Manhattan.''
 The house they found at 136 West 130th Street was caught up in the relentless reincarnation of Harlem as a genteel residential neighborhood over the last decade. Once divided into apartments, it had become a vacant shell. Bill Rohlfing, a developer, bought the property for $425,000 in 2002 and began to transform it into a one-family house. Mr. Rohlfing retained the brownstone exterior, but modernized the interior by exposing old brick and installing recessed lighting and a floating steel staircase. 
 In 2004, the Mathisons paid $1.225 million for the house, then 80 percent finished, and hired Mr. Rohlfing to install the custom finishes to complete the job. Now it is being offered by Norman Horowitz, a broker at Halstead Property, who also has the listing for the vacant shell next door ($895,000). 
 The house has three bedrooms, two baths and a playroom with a skylight on the top level, as well a master bedroom with a two-person tub. The open parlor floor has a fireplace, a kitchen and a living room.
 Meanwhile, the Mathisons are looking for a home near his new studio, somewhere around Pasadena, Calif.

HEADLINE: Gray Matters

BYLINE: By ROBERT E. BRYAN

 BODY:
Back in 1955, when denim was the height of rebelliousness, Sloan Wilson's novel ''The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit'' turned a men's classic into a synonym for drab, middle-class conformity. More than 50 years later, with everyone in jeans and T-shirts, this reliable warhorse has become oddly hip. 
 Flannel had humble beginnings -- the name is reputedly derived from ''gwlanen,'' Welsh for woolen cloth -- and was used for underwear in the 19th century. In the 1880s white flannel was worn for summer sports; by the 1920s the more seasonless gray had became a favorite. When the Prince of Wales wore gray flannel trousers on his 1924 trip to America, they were aped by collegiates on both sides of the Atlantic. Cary Grant and Fred Astaire then carried the trend through to the 1940s. 
 The archetypal square of the postwar era was later described by Esquire's style encyclopedia as ''a neat, circumspect, conservative man who carried an attache case and regarded a pink button-down shirt as his one sartorial fling.'' This character became so emblematic that it was mocked in Disney's ''The Horse in the Gray Flannel Suit'' and an episode of ''Bewitched'' called ''The Warlock in the Gray Flannel Suit.'' 
 In spite of these cinematic slights and the anti-establishment attitudes of the '60s and '70s, gray flannel held its own: Sean Connery wore two gray flannel suits in ''Goldfinger''; Gianni Agnelli was seen in a bespoke version. 
 The current craze for this ultramasculine fabric might be due to the economy -- with jobs on the line, projecting control is a sensible investment. For fall, Brunello Cucinelli showed a great shawl-collared suit and tailcoat. But you can partake in the trend even if you're not the corporate type: Thom Browne's puffer jackets for Moncler are definitely more Avenue B than Madison Avenue. ROBERT E. BRYAN
 RETURN ENGAGEMENT
 Sean Connery's dashing look for ''Goldfinger''? It's flannel -- gray flannel.
 In 1975 Geoffrey Beene introduced Grey Flannel, one of the first men's designer colognes, which became a runaway hit.
 Moncler's jackets are usually shiny and brightly colored; not this season's versions, courtesy of Thom Browne.
 Bottega Veneta modernized the traditional flannel suit with a two-in-one jacket.
 Disney's take on the trend: the 1968 film ''The Horse in the Gray Flannel Suit.''
 Brunello Cucinelli hit the right note with his superelegant yet low-key gray flannel tuxedo.
 Flannel trousers like the ones the Prince of Wales wore in the 1920s were commonly called ''grayers.''

 BODY:
IF you love cats, kitten heaven is the old-fashioned bathroom in Tammy Cross's apartment in a Beaux-Arts building on the Upper West Side. In this small space, five balls of fluff, none bigger than a fist and some just two days old, are napping, reclining or rolling about in various states of adorableness.
 ''This is the nursery,'' explained Ms. Cross, who has been saving needy animals ever since her childhood in Florida and Connecticut, where she retrieved baby squirrels that had fallen out of their nests. ''This is where they stay when they're on the bottle.'' 
 As many of the city's cat fanciers know, Ms. Cross is the guiding spirit behind Kitten Little Rescue, an organization that does exactly what its name implies -- rescues sick, abused or abandoned kittens and shows them off on summer weekends at 72nd Street and Columbus Avenue. The hope is that by being so enchanting, they will attract adoptive families or at least foster parents willing to house them temporarily.
 In many respects, the sunny one-bedroom apartment on Broadway, near 86th Street, where Ms. Cross has lived for 15 years and for which she pays about $1,000 in rent, represents the mother ship of Kitten Little Rescue. Here, some 6 to 18 baby kittens -- and once as many as 22 -- are bottle fed and nursed back to health.
 Ms. Cross, 51, a vivacious woman who often wears her dark blond hair in a casually tied-back ponytail (extra hair clips are attached to the brass headboard of her bed), has been living a life defined by cats ever since she came to New York at 22. Early on, she began supporting herself by working as a manager and booker at jazz clubs, all the while bouncing from one apartment to another. 
 The one in which she lives now was a two-year sublet. At the end of the two years, through a complicated but legal transaction, the prime tenant signed the apartment over to her. ''It's a real New York story,'' Ms. Cross said, her voice breaking as she described her unexpected good fortune. ''You never know who your benefactors will be.'' 
 Despite Ms. Cross's near obsession with her small charges, you don't walk into her apartment and immediately think to yourself, ''Oh, my God, a crazy cat person lives here.'' 
 That is by design.
 ''I'm not so far gone,'' she said. ''I live a pretty normal life. And at the end of the day, I've got to want to come home to my place.''
 At first glance, you see only a cheerful and, at about 450 square feet, extremely cozy space. Gauzy white curtains flutter at the windows. The living room walls were recently painted Jazz Age Coral by Ms. Cross's boyfriend, Ron McCormick, who paints restored houses along the Connecticut shore and thought the color appropriate in a building constructed shortly after the turn of the last century.
 ''Ron, it looks like salmon,'' Ms. Cross complained when she saw his handiwork.
 ''It's true to the era,'' he insisted.
 He also painted the moldings white. 
 ''They're supposed to pop,'' Ms. Cross explained, sounding dubious.
 The carved oak fireplace in the living room is original, as is the mirror above it. The minuscule kitchen has no stove, as is the case in others of the older, unrenovated apartments in this building, a former hotel. Nevertheless, using only a microwave oven, a convection oven and a hot plate, Ms. Cross has whipped up lavish Thanksgiving dinners, turkey and ham included, for a dozen of her volunteers. It is these volunteers, along with contributions from the public, that help sustain her rescue work, an activity she has been pursuing officially for nearly 20 years.
 Still, make no mistake. Cats are in residence. Move the sofa, and you will come upon a knot of cat toys. Don't watch where you're going, and you could step on a kitten, which is why Ms. Cross walks around the apartment barefoot. Mewing punctuates any conversation, as do occasional phone calls from staff at the Center for Animal Care and Control, the city's shelter, seeking to place strays that might otherwise almost certainly be euthanized. 
 ''Hey, Jess, how many?'' Ms. Cross said into the phone on a recent morning. ''Single? How old? What color? Black and white. Of course. Send it over, honey. You got the address?''
 In every respect, this is a cat-friendly environment. Because kittens sometimes get extremely sick, the white slipcovers on the sofa and the loveseat are washable, or as Ms. Cross puts it, ''When it's so bad that the vet prescribes holy water, you have to be able to spray with Clorox.'' 
 Wrapped around a door frame is a swatch of gray industrial carpet that makes an ideal scratching post and takes up not an inch of floor space.
 The walk-in closet in the bedroom, the apartment's only closet, is packed to the rafters with cat carriers. And in the bathroom are kittens that are Ms. Cross's specialty, those that are ill or very young or cannot eat on their own.
 Yet despite their numbers, the space is scrupulously clean. The three litter boxes are emptied so religiously that you would never know just by sniffing that this is what pet supply manufacturers describe as a multiple-cat household.
 Whether there will be quite so many cats in Ms. Cross's future is uncertain. Concerned about the state of the economy after Sept. 11, she decided to go to nursing school.
 ''I've been nursing critically ill kittens,'' she said. ''Really, it was a natural.''
 She received her degree in June from the Long Island College Hospital School of Nursing. Next step: passing the state boards and finding a job.
 But she has no intention of forsaking the kittens that have become so much a part of her life, and this day she was sitting on the loveseat with Ducky -- ''because he follows me around like a duck'' -- on her lap. He was getting ready to drink from a tiny baby bottle filled with KMR -- Kitten Milk Replacer -- that had been heated in a cup of hot water.
 ''It's almost warm, pumpkin,'' she said to her small charge. Contentedly, he rested a paw no thicker than a straw on her arm and was soon sucking hungrily on a minuscule nipple.

PAUL JACOBS You don't have to be an organist to know that Bach's Trio Sonatas (BWV 525-30) are hard to play: the most difficult of all Bach's organ works, according to a news release from the Juilliard School, a fine distinction best left for organists to debate. But for Mr. Jacobs, who has performed those complete works several times, once in an 18-hour marathon in Pittsburgh, this sprint through the trio sonatas, which opens the Juilliard concert season, must seem little more than a warm-up. Might he venture the full cycle, or even the marathon, for New Yorkers after Lincoln Center reinstalls the organ in the refurbished Alice Tully Hall next year? Tuesday. Paul Hall, Juilliard School.
 ALAN GILBERT This son of New York Philharmonic violinists past and present officially opens his tenure as the orchestra's music director with works by Berlioz, Messiaen and Magnus Lindberg. Wednesday. Avery Fisher Hall. 
 MAHLER'S THIRD SYMPHONY Alan Gilbert takes a calculated risk in his first subscription concerts as music director of the New York Philharmonic, presenting an imposing work that begins with a resounding horn call that has vanquished the orchestra's French horn players more than once. Mr. Gilbert presumably knows the danger, having suffered through horn passages in Haydn's Symphony No. 48 with them last year. Maybe they'll shape up now that he's the boss. In any case, Mr. Gilbert's performance of Mahler's First Symphony with the orchestra in May met with considerable acclaim, a good omen for this outing, which should speak volumes about his developing relationship with the orchestra as a whole. Thursday-Friday, Sept. 22. Avery Fisher Hall.
 AVANT GARDNER The New York Philharmonic is not the only staid institution to establish a contemporary-music series this year. The Gardner Museum in Boston, which has long presented concerts of a more traditional cast, presents the Callithumpian Consort, a new-music ensemble directed by the enterprising pianist and conductor Stephen Drury, in this series of programs of 20th- and 21st-century repertory, beginning with an evening of Japanese music. The second program features young composers; the third, the premiere of Christian Wolff's ''Songs From Brecht: The Exception and the Rule.'' Thursday, Jan. 21, March 18. Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, Boston, (617) 278-5156, gardnermuseum.org.
 'TOSCA' As advertised, there will be no grab-bag gala to open the season at the Met, the first planned entirely by Peter Gelb and James Levine. Instead, Mr. Gelb, who has pledged himself to a concern for theatrical values, starts with a bit of a risk. The first of eight new productions this season is a staging of Puccini's opera by the European star Luc Bondy (in his Met debut) with sets described by a company spokesman as ''spare,'' replacing the lavish and popular production by Franco Zeffirelli. Still, theatrical values or no, Mr. Gelb is not stinting on vocal power, with Karita Mattila and Marcelo Alvarez in the first cast. Opens Sept. 21. Metropolitan Opera House.
 CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER The society opens its first full season in its refurbished home, a prospect that seems to delight its members despite the alarms raised about the hall's new acoustics and amenities in certain critical quarters. Apart from a commissioned work by David Bruce, ''The North Wind Was a Woman,'' the choice items here are arrangements: two of those delicious chamber retoolings of Strauss waltzes by Second Viennese School types, one each by Schoenberg and Webern; and Erwin Stein's reduction of the finale of Mahler's Fourth Symphony, with Dawn Upshaw as vocal soloist. Sept. 23. Alice Tully Hall.
 MILLER THEATER The auditorium on the campus of Columbia University that under the leadership of George Steel became known especially for early-music and contemporary-music programs, promises to continue a similarly bifurcated course under its new director, Melissa Smey, at least until she gets her programming feet on the ground. In a season still planned mostly by Mr. Steel, the trademark Composer Portraits and Bach and the Baroque series are complemented by series devoted to jazz and to early music. But the season starts somewhere in between with a program called '' 'The Blue Rider' in Performance,'' produced in collaboration with the series Works & Process at the Guggenheim in conjunction with the Guggenheim Museum's Kandinsky retrospective (opening on Friday). Conceived and directed by the thoughtful programmer and skilled pianist Sarah Rothenberg, and based on Kandinsky and Franz Marc's ''Blue Rider Almanac'' of 1912, the production presents works by Schoenberg, Berg, Webern, Scriabin, Arthur Lourie and Thomas de Hartmann, performed by Ms. Rothenberg, the Brentano String Quartet and the mezzo-soprano Susan Narucki, with choreography by Karole Armitage performed by her company Armitage Gone! Dance. Sept. 23, 25.
 JENNIFER KOH Bach abounds this season, not least on the campus of Columbia University, where the Miller Theater, in addition to its Bach and the Baroque series, is devoting its popular free Lunchtime Concerts in Philosophy Hall to Bach solo works, presented one at a time. Ms. Koh leads off, in fall and spring, with the sonatas and partitas for violin, to be followed by her husband, the pianist Benjamin Hochman, in the keyboard partitas (in October and April) and by Alisa Weilerstein in the cello suites (in November and April). Sept. 28-30; March 22-24. Philosophy Hall, Columbia University.
 GOTHAM EARLY MUSIC SCENE Early-music performers in New York used to complain about a lack of appropriate, acoustically welcoming spaces: hard to imagine in a city with, for starters, such a variety of churches. But it may not have been entirely churches they had in mind. This early-music presenting organization crows in a news release that it has found ''the perfect atmosphere for 16th- through 18th-century music, as audiences of that time often ate, drank and talked at musical events.'' So it is setting up residence for three nights at the city's trendiest club for new and newer music, each featuring, in Gotham's patented format, three groups. The first program offers music of Handel, performed by Uncommon Temperament; early and traditional world music, by East of the River; and music from the court of Catherine the Great, by the Clarion Music Society. A question nags. Catherine's court is one thing, but will this bibulous atmosphere also be perfect for East of the River's medieval Armenian chant? Sept. 30, Oct. 1-2. Le Poisson Rouge.
 OCTOBER
 CARNEGIE HALL The pianist Evgeny Kissin and the Boston Symphony Orchestra open Carnegie's season, harking back to another Carnegie opening, in 1995, when Mr. Kissin gave a fresh and brilliant account of Tchaikovsky's First Piano Concerto and the orchestra, led by Seiji Ozawa, responded with a similar virtuosic flair. Chopin's Second Concerto, heard here, lacks some of the panache of the Tchaikovsky, and James Levine is an altogether different podium creature from Mr. Ozawa, so the thrills may be of a more subdued, cerebral sort. The program, which will also open the orchestra's season at Symphony Hall in Boston on Sept. 23, includes ''Le Carnaval Romain'' by Berlioz, ''La Mer'' by Debussy and a new work by the film specialist John Williams, ''On Willows and Birches.'' Oct. 1.
 CARAMOOR FALL FESTIVAL So you've established a successful summer music festival an hour or so north of New York: in, that is to say, prime fall foliage country. The question is not what the next logical step is but why it took so long to happen. Alan Gilbert conducts the New York Philharmonic in Beethoven -- the Seventh Symphony and the Fourth Piano Concerto, with Emanuel Ax as soloist -- on the Friday (Oct. 2) to open this new event. After a daylong program and an evening with Chick Corea on Saturday, the festival ends on Sunday with a recital by the soprano Sumi Jo, accompanied by Will Crutchfield, the director of opera at Caramoor. It's brief, and it may be a little early for peak foliage, but it's a start. Oct. 2-4. Caramoor Center for Music and the Arts, Katonah, N.Y., (914) 232-1252, caramoor.org.
 'KURTAG'S GHOSTS' In the series Peak Performances@Montclair, the Italian pianist Marino Formenti plays miniatures by the Hungarian composer Gyorgy Kurtag interspersed with short works by his musical models, including Machaut, Bach, Schumann, Boulez, Stockhausen and Ligeti. ''Six centuries of music,'' it is promised, ''flow in an unbroken stream of sound.'' Oct. 3. Alexander Kasser Theater, Montclair, N.J., (973) 655-5112, peakperfs.org. 
 DANIELLE DE NIESE The soprano celebrates the release of her new Mozart CD at the hot new classical music nightclub. Oct. 6. Le Poisson Rouge.
 AXIOM A new-music group from the Juilliard School performs three concerts at Le Poisson Rouge. Oct. 7, Dec. 12, Feb. 17.
 GUSTAVO DUDAMEL His arrival is being hyped as a sort of second coming, but in a far more modest sense, it is a third coming for the orchestra. Like his immediate predecessor as music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, Esa-Pekka Salonen, and a more distant one, Zubin Mehta, when they arrived, Mr. Dudamel is young, dashing and charismatic. They shaped the orchestra as much as it shaped them, and Mr. Dudamel seems to have similar potential. After a free celebration at the Hollywood Bowl on Oct. 3, including a performance of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, Mr. Dudamel conducts his inaugural concert, consisting of ''City Noir,'' a work by John Adams commissioned for the occasion, and Mahler's First Symphony. Oct. 8. Walt Disney Concert Hall, Los Angeles, (323) 850-2000, laphil.com.
 HAHN-BIN The beauty of the backing of an organization like Young Concert Artists is that it gives a young artist a leg up in establishing a name. But even before he performs in the gala opening concert of Young Concert Artists' 49th season here, the young Korean violinist Hahn-Bin, a protege of Itzhak Perlman, took matters into his own hands -- or out of them. Last month he became the latest in a long line of performers, from Yo-Yo Ma on down, to make news by leaving a valuable instrument in a New York cab and happily, in his case as in Mr. Ma's, recovering it. Perhaps he should walk to work on this evening. Oct. 8. Zankel Hall.
 CECILIA BARTOLI Mezzo-sopranos and contraltos, male as well as female, owe a certain debt of gratitude to the castratos of earlier centuries, those generations of men shorn of their sex to preserve the high-flying voices of their youth. And several have acknowledged it in albums devoted to specific singers or to the repertory created for them. Ms. Bartoli, whose recent projects have tended as much toward the scholarly as toward the vocal, goes further with ''Sacrificium'' (sacrifice indeed!), an album -- more, a sort of meditation on the condition -- including a 108-page lexicon of castration and jarring artwork featuring her visage superimposed on images of statuary of a maleness left suspect in varying degrees. And oh, yes, there are the performances, with Il Giardino Armonico conducted by Giovanni Antonini. She promises ''a little theatrical trickery,'' which she deems necessary to recreate the sound of the pickled voices for modern listeners. Ms. Bartoli will also present the material in a season-long tour of Europe, but American stay-at-homes will not get to experience whatever theatricality may be involved there, at least this season. Oct. 13. Decca.
 MITSUKO UCHIDA This pianist does so many things well, but she is typically at her best when plumbing the philosophical depths of late works by composers like Beethoven and Schubert. True, there aren't many composers like Beethoven and Schubert, though I, for one, ache to hear her play an evening of those ineffable late piano works of Brahms, miniature in form but vast in expressive content. That is for another day. Meanwhile, we can happily content ourselves with her latest thoughts on Beethoven's last three piano sonatas, Nos. 30-32. Oct. 14. Carnegie Hall.
 'FERVAAL' In recent years, the two summer weekends of the Bard Music Festival in Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., have led a to third in the fall. That may finally have proved too much talk and analysis even for this chattiest and most inquisitive of events. This year, instead, Leon Botstein, the festival's founder and co-director, and the American Symphony Orchestra, its house band, open their season in New York with a different kind of appendage. Elaborating further on the theme developed in August, Wagner and his world, they present a concert performance of a rarity representing the wave of Wagnerism that swept France in the late 19th century, Vincent d'Indy's 1893 opera ''Fervaal.'' Oct. 14. Avery Fisher Hall.
 ORCHESTRE REVOLUTIONNAIRE ET ROMANTIQUE Apart from the release of a few monster CD packages, commemorations of the 200th anniversary of Haydn's death have been relatively muted, at least in New York. But there are a few left this year and even next, including this ultra-high-quality import. John Eliot Gardiner, the larger of his period bands and the superb Monteverdi Choir present Haydn's two great oratorios, ''The Seasons'' and ''The Creation,'' with choice soloists including the soprano Lucy Crowe, the tenor James Gilchrist and the bass Matthew Rose. It doesn't get much better than this. Oct. 15, 17. Carnegie Hall.
 EMMA KIRKBY This soprano -- a leading light in the modern early-music movement when the British more or less set its tone, in the 1970s and '80s, and acclaimed especially for her sweet, pure tone -- has not been seen here much of late. It will be fascinating to hear what the voice retains of its characteristic otherworldly, almost childlike quality. A performance in New Haven on Oct. 18 and this one begin an American tour with the lutenist Jakob Lindberg, heavy on music of Dowland and Purcell, which runs until Nov. 3 and includes a Nov. 1 performance at Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church. Oct. 20. Weill Recital Hall.
 DG 111 As we have often had occasion to remark in this space, classical music marketers love an anniversary, any anniversary. Deutsche Grammophon celebrates its 111th birthday (111th?) and its corresponding artistic and technological history in weighty fashion, with a 55-CD box (because 55 is almost half of 111?), a 111-track sampler (well, obviously), an 11-DVD package (because 11 is 111 without a 1?) and a coffee table book. You would like to believe Michael Lang, the company's president, when he says, ''Deutsche Grammophon is poised for a vibrant future as remarkable as its storied past.'' Otherwise, this project might smack of desperation: an attempt to get in one last big celebration before ... well, what is going to happen to the classical record business? Oct. 20. Deutsche Grammophon.
 ANCIENT PATHS, MODERN VOICES: A FESTIVAL CELEBRATING CHINESE CULTURE Carnegie Hall's sphere of influence continues to expand. In recent seasons Carnegie produced festivals in collaboration with institutions throughout the city. This season's major festival, which begins here with a performance by the Quanzhou Marionette Theater and runs until Nov. 10, is also being presented in more leisurely fashion by the Philharmonic Society of Orange County in Costa Mesa, Calif., where performances run from Oct. 15 to Nov. 24. Performers on both coasts will include the pipa player Wu Man, who has also played a curatorial role, enlisting performers in a variety of folk styles, some of whom, it is said, have never traveled outside China; the pianist Lang Lang; the composer and conductor Tan Dun; and the violinist Cho-Liang Lin. Oct. 21. Zankel Hall.
 LONDON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA Alan Gilbert will not be the only one conducting Mahler at Avery Fisher Hall this season, in his new gig with the New York Philharmonic. Bernard Haitink, long an estimable Mahlerian, and the London orchestra will provide stiff competition with a veritable minifestival to open the Great Performers season at Lincoln Center, with evenings including, in chronological order, the Fourth Symphony, ''Das Lied von der Erde'' and the Ninth Symphony. Schubert symphonies, the Fifth and the Eighth, will aptly fill out the earlier programs. Oct. 21, 23, 25. Avery Fisher Hall.
 DALLAS OPERA As Lincoln Center celebrates its 50th anniversary with an extensive makeover, a major competitor takes shape to the south. The Dallas Center for the Performing Arts opens officially with ceremonies and festivities beginning on Oct. 12. The major new element this season is the Margot and Bill Winspear Opera House, which the Dallas Opera takes over with a new production of Verdi's ''Otello,'' directed by Tim Albery. Clifton Forbis sings the title role, and Graeme Jenkins, the company's music director, conducts. Opens Oct. 23. Winspear Opera House, (214) 443-1000, dallasopera.org.
 PACIFICA QUARTET You can't always pinpoint the moment when a rising performer or group has arrived, but this may be one. These young players take over the season-long slot at the Met held for 43 years by the Guarneri Quartet, which perhaps represented establishment to a fault before its retirement last season. They warm to the task in the first concert with works by Mozart, Janacek and Brahms. Oct. 24, Jan. 16, Feb. 27. Metropolitan Museum.
 CHRISTIAN TETZLAFF What could possibly keep a listener from this great violinist's afternoon performances of Bach's unaccompanied sonatas and partitas, works he has recorded twice to excellent effect? Only -- for at least a few of us, or perhaps just one of us -- the fact that they fall on a prime football Sunday. These are difficult priorities the classical music world sets us. Oct. 25. 92nd Street Y.
 STILE ANTICO This fine British vocal group has quickly found its way to the top of the classical CD sales charts, partly, no doubt, on the strength of its backup work for Sting in his Dowland project. Here, happily, you can hear the group sing settings of the Song of Songs by Palestrina, Lassus and Victoria in the Music Before 1800 series without having to hear Sting's breathy vocalism woefully misplaced. Oct. 25. Corpus Christi Church.
 JUILLIARD BAROQUE The Juilliard School takes a great leap backward this fall, installing its curriculum in historical performance, and members of its faculty make up this ensemble, led by the violinist Monica Huggett, the program's artistic director. Bach's ''Musical Offering'' is a fitting choice for its debut, along with an Oboe Concerto in F (BWV 1053). Oct. 27. Paul Hall, Juilliard School.
 'YO-YO MA: 30 YEARS OUTSIDE THE BOX' There is certainly an audience for the cellist Yo-Yo Ma, a huge one, and rightly so. But is there a sizable audience for all of Yo-Yo Ma, or at least all the original albums he has made? Sony Classical seems to think so as it releases this 90-CD limited edition, with a 312-page hardcover book and other bonuses. But you always have to wonder, with this sort of thing, isn't the potential buyer the very fan who, ipso facto, is likely to have most of these recordings already? And how much does, for example, high-tech remastering matter at a time when listeners routinely sacrifice sound quality to portability? These may be issues best left to record executives, although that formulation rings a little like leaving the economy to bankers. Here it all is, at any rate, in plenty of time for holiday giving. Oct. 27.
 TILL FELLNER Listeners who followed this fine Austrian player through the first two seasons of his complete survey of the Beethoven piano sonatas at the Met, or who even just sampled a program or two, will probably need no recommendation for these final performances. All of which may leave few seats for anyone else. Oct. 30, Feb. 12, March 26. Metropolitan Museum.
 NOVEMBER
 'A CHINESE HOME' As part of the Carnegie Hall festival Ancient Paths, Modern Voices, the Kronos Quartet, the pipa player Wu Man and the director Chen Shi-Zheng (remembered by many for his epic production of ''The Peony Pavilion'') collaborate in this meditation on Chinese history and culture, inspired by Yin Yu Tang, a 300-year-old house from southeastern China that was transported in pieces to Salem, Mass., where it was reassembled at the Peabody Essex Museum. Tan Dun's ''Ghost Opera'' completes the program. Nov. 3. Zankel Hall.
 ST. LOUIS SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA David Robertson conducts Tan Dun's Water Concerto (with the percussionist Colin Currie) and Bright Sheng's ''Colors of Crimson'' as part of Carnegie's Ancient Paths, Modern Voices festival. The program also includes Stravinsky's ''Chant du Rossignol'' and Bartok's ''Miraculous Mandarin'' Suite. Nov. 4. Carnegie Hall.
 NEW YORK CITY OPERA To judge from the amount of tendentious, almost gleeful reporting of the company's misadventures over the last year or two, there have been people hoping, for whatever dark reasons, that this moment would never come. If the City Opera, under the new management of George Steel and in a partially refurbished auditorium, does indeed survive to begin even a truncated season with this gala concert of excerpts from American operas and musicals (and the odds now seem well in its favor), there will be ample reason to celebrate. Nov. 5. David H. Koch Theater.
 SCHUBERT ASCENDING The Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center devotes three concerts to the astounding output of Schubert's final year, including the C major String Quintet, the ''Schwanengesang'' and other songs. Inon Barnatan organizes and plays the Piano Sonata in B flat (D. 960); Jonathan Biss plays the Sonata in A (D. 959), which he also performs on a new CD from Wigmore Hall Live. Nov. 6, 8, 10. Alice Tully Hall.
 'ESTHER' The tastes and proclivities that George Steel showed in more than a decade of programming at the Miller Theater give every reason to believe that at least the contemporary-music part of the New York City Opera's traditional mission will be well tended to. In what is undoubtedly meant as a statement, he leads off with a revival of a thorny late work by Hugo Weisgall, who died in 1997. The City Opera gave the work's premiere in 1993 to considerable critical acclaim. What the music may lack in immediate audience appeal could be offset in part by curiosity about the state of the revived company and the altered amenities and acoustics of the auditorium. Lauren Flanigan reprises the title role, which she created. Opens Nov. 7. David H. Koch Theater.
 ATLANTA SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA Robert Spano conducts Angel Lam's ''Awakening From a Disappearing Garden,'' with Yo-Yo Ma as cello soloist, as part of Carnegie's Ancient Paths, Modern Voices festival. Stravinsky's ''Rossignol'' fills out the program, with the Atlanta Symphony Chamber Chorus and vocal soloists including the sopranos Celena Shafer and Jessica Rivera. Nov. 7. Carnegie Hall.
 'DON GIOVANNI' With a truncated schedule of five operas this season, the New York City Opera isn't pretending to do much more than pick up the pieces after a couple of years of drift and disintegration. But it stretches a bit with this new production, directed by Christopher Alden and starring Daniel Okulitch in his company debut. Opens Nov. 8. David H. Koch Theater.
 GRAND VALLEY STATE UNIVERSITY NEW MUSIC ENSEMBLE A New York performance of Steve Reich's Music for 18 Musicians in 2007 and an Innova recording of the piece made a name for this Michigan ensemble, if not quite a household one. Now, with an Innova release of Terry Riley's ''In C'' imminent, it returns to New York to perform ''In C'' with a live remix by Dennis DeSantis. Undoubtedly a hot ticket. Nov. 8. Le Poisson Rouge. 
 SHANGHAI SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA With all the hubbub over China's great awakening to Western classical music of late -- including the Carnegie festival Ancient Paths, Modern Voices, of which this concert is a part -- it is easy to overlook the prehistory. This ensemble, China's oldest symphony orchestra, was founded in 1879, 2 years before the Boston Symphony, 12 before the Chicago Symphony, 21 before the Philadelphia Orchestra and 39 before the Cleveland Orchestra. Long Yu, the orchestra's new music director, conducts it in Rachmaninoff's Second Piano Concerto, with Lang Lang as soloist, and Chen Qigang's ''Iris Devoilee.'' Nov. 10. Carnegie Hall.
 BERLIN PHILHARMONIC There were many reasons to treasure this orchestra's extended residency in New York in 2007, but at least for me (as part of a minority, to judge from praise lavished by others), its concerts at Carnegie Hall under Simon Rattle, ostensibly the residency's centerpiece, were the least of them. This is a virtuoso band, no question, and to all appearances, eminently responsive. But Mr. Rattle seems to think he has to pull a performance out of it forcibly, as if extracting a tooth. Insider reports on the health of the Rattle-Berlin marriage, despite a renewal of vows, continue to vary widely. All I know is what I hear from the stage, and I will be listening avidly to the performances of the four Brahms symphonies and works by Schoenberg here, in hopes that that earlier experience was somehow aberrant, on the orchestra's part or on mine. Nov. 11-13. Carnegie Hall.
 'FROM THE HOUSE OF THE DEAD' The Metropolitan Opera offers its first production of Janacek's opera, directed by Patrice Chereau and conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen. Opens Nov. 12. Metropolitan Opera House.
 'PICTURES REFRAMED' Or alternatively, perhaps, ''Moving Pictures at an Exhibition.'' The New Visions series of Great Performers at Lincoln Center presents the premiere of a collaborative reimagining of Mussorgsky's ''Pictures at an Exhibition'' by the pianist Leif Ove Andsnes and the video artist Robin Rhode, which will provide fodder for an international tour and a deluxe CD and DVD edition from EMI Classics. The paintings of Victor Hartmann that inspired Mussorgsky's work are typically left far behind in Mr. Rhode's high-concept video. The last movement, ''The Great Gate of Kiev'' (to cite only the image of which the creators seem proudest), occasions the drowning and disintegration of a piano. But no animals were harmed in the making of the film. Anticlimactic as it may seem, the musical program also includes selections from Schumann's ''Kinderszenen'' and a new work by Thomas Larcher. Nov. 13-14. Alice Tully Hall.
 OPERA ORCHESTRA OF NEW YORK This company, battered by the recession, canceled a concert performance of Wagner's ''Rienzi'' in February, promising it instead for this season. No such luck. In what its music director, Eve Queler, calls a ''bridge season,'' there will be no complete opera, and the orchestra will perform only once, here with the soprano Aprile Millo, conducted by Ms. Queler. As pianist, Ms. Queler will also accompany two of the three solo recitals that will fill out the season. Nov. 17. Rose Theater.
 'KEPLER' Philip Glass's operas have from the outset, with ''Einstein on the Beach,'' reflected a fascination with scientists, especially physicists and astronomers whose work borders on cosmology. His latest opera, on Johannes Kepler, the 17th-century scientist who discovered the laws of planetary motion, has its premiere in Linz, Austria, on Saturday, and the Brooklyn Academy of Music is quick to bring it to New York. Well, almost. The academy will present what it calls a concert staging; precisely where that falls on the spectrum from unstaged through semistaged to fully staged is unclear. But the cast, the Bruckner Orchestra Linz and the conductor, Dennis Russell Davies, all fresh from the Linz premiere, should be well equipped to imbue the notes and the words with life, if not action. Nov. 18, 20, 21. BAM Howard Gilman Opera House, 30 Lafayette Avenue, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100, bam.org.
 RICCARDO MUTI In the 2010-11 season this maestro ever in demand will focus his orchestral attentions mainly on Chicago, his operatic attentions mainly on Rome. But in the meantime, New York will enjoy much of both, as he conducts five subscription weeks this season with the New York Philharmonic and a run of Verdi's ''Attila'' at the Metropolitan Opera. Here he conducts the Philharmonic in a program of Liszt, Elgar and Prokofiev at the Kimmel Center in Philadelphia (Nov. 20) and the Kennedy Center in Washington (Nov. 21) as well as in New York. Nov. 19, 24. Avery Fisher Hall.
 DECEMBER
 'LES CONTES D'HOFFMANN' Otherwise known as ''Survivor.'' Rolando Villazon vacated the island because of vocal surgery, and Rene Pape voted himself off, evidently not having warmed to the roles of the four villains once he had made their acquaintance. Elina Garanca has decamped for another island, to take over the New Year performances of ''Carmen'' that Angela Gheorghiu dumped. Anna Netrebko (who has already ducked out of ''La Traviata'' for the 2010-11 season) remains in play at press time, but I wouldn't bet the farm on her. Ah, the tales Hoffmann could spin of the modern-day Met. The new production is directed by Bartlett Sher and conducted by James Levine. Opens Dec. 3. Metropolitan Opera House.
 MENDELSSOHN STRING QUARTET As the Mendelssohn bicentenary winds down, so does a namesake quartet, after 30 years. Here these respected players -- Miriam Fried and Nicholas Mann, violinists; Daniel Panner, violist; and Marcy Rosen, cellist -- make their final New York appearance together. With appropriate sentiment and perhaps a touch of humor, they lead off with Mendelssohn's A minor Quartet, ''Ist Es Wahr?'' (''Is It True?''). They also play Bartok's Second Quartet and Beethoven's Opus 132. Dec. 3. Weill Recital Hall.
 'MESSIAH' As always, options to hear Handel's oratorio, written for the Lenten season, will be many at Christmastime. But this perennial by the St. Thomas Choir of Men and Boys and Concert Royal, conducted by John Scott, remains as reliable as any and better than most. Dec. 8, 10. St. Thomas Church, Fifth Avenue at 53rd Street, (212) 664-9360, saintthomaschurch.org. 
 'ONE EVENING' The tenor Mark Padmore, who sings Schubert's ''Winterreise'' beautifully in the original German on a new recording from Harmonia Mundi with the pianist Paul Lewis, performs it here in a new English translation with Andrew West as part of a larger evening in the New Visions series of Great Performers at Lincoln Center. Directed by Katie Mitchell, the production, which originated in London in June, adds a third haunting sensibility to those of Schubert and Wilhelm Muller, who wrote the ''Winter Journey'' poems: that of Samuel Beckett, who loved Schubert and once wrote of ''Winterreise'' that he was ''shivering through the grim journey again.'' Excerpts from Beckett's prose and poetry will be read by an actor in an attempt to trace influences. Dec. 9-11. Gerald W. Lynch Theater, John Jay College, 10th Avenue between 58th and 59th Streets, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org.
 LES VIOLONS DU ROY Does New York need yet another version of Handel's ''Messiah'' at Christmastime? Perhaps not, though this one, by the fine Canadian period-instrument ensemble conducted by Bernard Labadie, with the chorus La Chapelle de Quebec and soloists led by the soprano Rosemary Joshua and the countertenor David Daniels, promises to be considerably better than average. And since there is never a glut of performances of Bach's ''Christmas Oratorio'' here, the group's second evening, a presentation of that work with the same chorus and most of the same soloists, promises even more than the first. Dec. 11-12. Carnegie Hall.
 MARC-ANDRE HAMELIN This Canadian pianist with a monster technique plied the (did I say lunatic?) fringes of the repertory for some time, and in those areas there was no one much to compare him with. Now that he has edged closer to the center (with, most recently, Hyperion's release of the second volume of his superb Haydn sonata survey), we begin to learn what an exceptional interpreter he is. He plays Haydn here, and a bit of Faure. But the big pieces are Liszt's B minor Sonata and Schumann's C major Fantasy. He will surely tame them, but better, he will almost certainly bring them to vibrant life. Dec. 12. 92nd Street Y.
 'VERKLARTE NACHT' Six excellent string players -- Maria Bachmann and Tim Fain, violinists; David Harding and Misha Amory, violists; and Wendy Sutter and Alexis Pia Gerlach, cellists -- perform Schoenberg's masterpiece of supersaturated Romanticism ''Transfigured Night,'' and the New York premiere of the Sextet for Strings by Philip Glass, in the Movado Hour series. Dec. 12-13. Baryshnikov Arts Center, 450 West 37th Street,Manhattan, (212) 868-4444, bacnyc.org.
 'EL NINO' Carnegie Hall completes what it calls a Nativity Triptych, begun in the preceding days with the Handel and Bach performances of Les Violons du Roy. John Adams's more or less operatic oratorio ''El Nino'' contemplates the Nativity story and takes as its larger subject the mystery of birth in general. Mr. Adams conducts the Orchestra of St. Luke's, the Westminster Symphonic Choir and vocal soloists including Dawn Upshaw, Michelle DeYoung and Eric Owens. Dec. 13.
 ENSEMBLE ACJW The venerable uptown meets the new downtown as a group spawned by Carnegie Hall and the Juilliard School gives the first of four concerts at a thriving Greenwich Village club. Dec. 13. Le Poisson Rouge.
 'STIFTER'S DINGE' Whatever: bring it on. I had virtually no idea what to expect when I encountered Heiner Goebbels's ''Surrogate Cities'' at the Spoleto U.S.A. festival in Charleston, S.C., in 2000, despite having heard a recording. (That work, from 1994, is long overdue in New York, and the Park Avenue Armory would be an ideal setting.) Nor did I have much of an idea what to expect from Mr. Goebbels's ''Songs of Wars I Have Seen,'' presented at the International Chamber Orchestra Festival presented by the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra in January. And both experiences proved utterly compelling, not so much for any coherent dramatic action as for the richly evocative, almost palpable atmospheres they created. Apart from the fact that the armory will bring its own rough-hewn atmosphere into the equation, I have little idea what to expect from this work, inspired by writings of the 19th-century poet and novelist Adalbert Stifter and incorporating texts of Claude Levi-Strauss, Malcolm X and William S. Burroughs. But I wouldn't miss it for anything. Dec. 16-20. Park Avenue Armory, 643 Park Avenue, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org.
 CONTACT The New York Philharmonic inaugurates its new contemporary-music series, which presents seven commissioned works in two programs, winter and spring. Dec. 17, April 16. Symphony Space. Dec. 19, April 17. Metropolitan Museum.
 ANONYMOUS 4 If Brett Favre can come out of retirement yet again, why not Anonymous 4? At this point, all four of the women on the nationwide tour beginning in October may throw a better pass than Mr. Favre does (or is that just the Packers fan in me speaking?), and they certainly all sing better. Here, in Corpus Christi Church's invaluable Music Before 1800 series, they perform their newest program, ''The Cherry Tree,'' consisting of medieval English carols and English-influenced American sacred songs. Dec. 20. Corpus Christi Church.
 'CARMEN' Happy New Year, more or less. Many of Peter Gelb's best-laid plans at the Met have been sent back to the drawing board by star cancellations. This new production, directed by Richard Eyre, was conceived primarily for the soprano Angela Gheorghiu, bravely venturing the mezzo-soprano title role, and her husband, the tenor Roberto Alagna, a couple that has given the Met fits before. But Ms. Gheorghiu withdrew last month from six of her eight performances, the very ones that Mr. Alagna is singing. Hmm. In a more conventional bit of recasting, the fast-rising mezzo-soprano Elina Garanca will take over the early performances opposite Mr. Alagna. Ms. Gheorghiu will sing two performances in April and May with the tenor Jonas Kaufmann. Yannick Nezet-Seguin conducts. Opens Dec. 31. Metropolitan Opera House.
 JANUARY
 VIENNA PHILHARMONIC Daniel Barenboim and Pierre Boulez, who took turns on the podium in the Staatskapelle Berlin's Mahler symphony cycle at Carnegie Hall in May, return as a tag team with a better band. Mr. Barenboim conducts the first concert and the third, which includes five of Mr. Boulez's ''Notations''; Mr. Boulez conducts the second, with Mr. Barenboim playing Schoenberg's Piano Concerto. The programs -- more Second Viennese School than First, with Schoenberg as a unifying thread -- are on the whole more challenging than those the orchestra usually brings to Carnegie. The audience turnout may tell tales to add to those of February and March, when -- for reasons economic or programmatic -- neither the Vienna Philharmonic (with Zubin Mehta) nor the Chicago Symphony (with Mr. Boulez) sold out Carnegie, as they would once have done in a heartbeat. (The inferior Mahler concerts, on the other hand, sold briskly. Go figure.) Jan. 15-17. Carnegie Hall.
 1610 VESPERS The period-instrument group Artek enlists others, Piffaro and Parthenia, as well as the National Gallery of Art Vocal Ensemble for a landmark performance of Monteverdi's great sacred work, celebrating the quatercentenary of its publication. Gwendolyn Toth, Artek's founder and director, conducts. Jan. 17. National Gallery of Art, Washington, (202) 842-6941, nga.gov. Jan. 20. Church of St. Ignatius Loyola, 980 Park Avenue, (212) 288-2520, smssconcerts. org.
 'SIMON BOCCANEGRA' Placido Domingo has sung leading tenor roles in any number of operas in his four-decade career at the Met, including the part of Gabriele Adorno in this one, and has conducted a fair number of other operas. But now he takes on a baritone role for the first time with the company, that of Boccanegra himself, with Marcello Giordani as the designated tenor and James Levine conducting. Bassos, consider yourselves warned. Opens Jan. 18. Metropolitan Opera House.
 'CELEBRATING STRAVINSKY' Last January, the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra celebrated its 50th anniversary with an international festival of chamber orchestras while the Minnesota Orchestra was celebrating Leonard Bernstein. This January, in a tighter economic climate, they will combine their efforts in two programs of Stravinsky, conducted by Roberto Abbado and Osmo Vanska. The second program, presented twice, ends with both orchestras taking part in what should be a blowout performance of ''The Rite of Spring.'' Jan. 21, 22. Orchestra Hall, Minneapolis. Jan. 23. Ordway Center, St. Paul. Jan. 24. Ted Mann Concert Hall, Minneapolis. (612) 371-5656 or (800) 292-4141, minnesotaorchestra.org.
 FOCUS! 2010 The Juilliard School's annual festival of contemporary music, often a scattershot affair, aims right at the bull's eye here with Music at the Center: Composing an American Mainstream, featuring works by William Schuman, a former president of the school; Leonard Bernstein; Samuel Barber; and many others. The standard-issue festival concludes with a concert performance of Aaron Copland's opera ''The Tender Land,'' conducted by David Effron. But as an April Fool's surprise ending, Leonard Slatkin conducts the Juilliard Orchestra in a complete program of Schuman's music. Jan. 22, 25-28, 30. Peter Jay Sharp Theater, Juilliard School. April 1. Avery Fisher Hall.
 EMANUEL AX Oh, yes, and a cellist named Yo-Yo Ma. But it is the pianist Mr. Ax who anchors a three-concert series, Celebrating Chopin and Schumann at 200. Peter Lieberson has written a new work for Mr. Ma and Mr. Ax, ''Remembering Schumann.'' The second evening, a solo recital by Mr. Ax, includes another premiere, of a work by John Adams; and the third, with Mr. Ax joined by the soprano Dawn Upshaw, offers the American premiere of piece by Osvaldo Golijov (with customized ''hyperaccordion,'' played by its deviser, Michael Ward-Bergeman). Jan. 29, Feb. 10, March 17. Carnegie Hall.
 CHICAGO SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA Last season, with Chicago, it was Janacek's Sinfonietta, Stravinsky's Symphony in Three Movements and Varese's ''Ameriques.'' Here it is Ravel's ''Tombeau de Couperin,'' Bartok's ''Bluebeard's Castle'' and Stravinsky's ''Firebird.'' Pierre Boulez seems determined in these Carnegie Hall concerts in his 80s to put a definitive stamp on the great masterworks of the first half of the 20th century. And who are we listeners to argue? These programs also include Mr. Boulez's ''Livre Pour Cordes'' and Marc-Andre Dalbavie's Flute Concerto. Mathieu Dufour is the flute soloist; Falk Struckmann and Michelle DeYoung sing Bluebeard and Judith. Jan. 30-31. Carnegie Hall.
 BEETHOVEN CYCLES The Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center will not win any awards for adventurous programming with this festival, but it should produce memorable performances and will almost certainly fill the houses. David Finckel and Wu Han, cellist and pianist and the society's directors, lead off the main body of the festival with the complete cello sonatas. The Brentano, Borromeo and Miami String Quartets and the Daedalus, Pacifica and Miro Quartets, most of them once mentored by the society, share the string quartets, beginning on Feb. 5. (In addition, a cycle of the violin sonatas, will be spread in three concerts throughout the season, on Oct. 8, Feb. 11 and May 13 at the Rose Theater.) Jan. 31-Feb. 23. Alice Tully Hall.
 GUITAR MARATHON This centerpiece of a guitar series at the Y features music by Bach or somehow related to Bach performed by many of the instrument's star performers. Jan. 31. 92nd Street Y.
 FEBRUARY
 GARRICK OHLSSON Few could celebrate the Chopin bicentennial in more masterly fashion than Mr. Ohlsson, who played all the composer's published piano works at Tully Hall and elsewhere and recorded them for Arabesque in the 1990s. Though you could obviously wish for more here as well, the programs are substantial, the first anchored by the Opus 28 Preludes, the second by the B flat minor Sonata. Feb. 3, March 21. Alice Tully Hall.
 VOX VOCAL ENSEMBLE With the impresario George Steel now firmly ensconced at the New York City Opera, his programming legacy lives on at the Miller Theater, and here he appears in person in the Miller's early-music series, conducting the Vox Vocal Ensemble in ''The Art of the Canon,'' a program that promises a fascinating pilgrimage extending from Josquin to Webern, by way of Jean Mouton, Tallis, Byrd, Mozart and others. Feb. 6. Church of St. Mary the Virgin, 145 West 46th Street, Manhattan.
 'BRANDENBURG' CONCERTOS Memo to Juilliard Baroque: Not to rain on your parade in only your second concert, but you already did Bach in your first, in October. For future reference, New York is awash in performances of the ''Brandenburgs'' over the holidays, and performances of the Third, Fourth and Fifth Concertos, however distinguished and historically informed, are not necessarily what even the most avid Bachian craves at this time of year. Feb. 7. Corpus Christi Church.
 PITTSBURGH SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA Like the Dallas Symphony Orchestra, Pittsburgh took on a rising European conductor little known in America as music director last season. Jaap van Zweden and the Dallas orchestra will have to wait yet another season to storm Carnegie Hall, in a new festival of American orchestras, Spring for Music, in May 2011. But Manfred Honeck, a former violinist and violist in the Vienna Philharmonic, has evidently stirred considerable excitement in Pittsburgh, and he and the orchestra are ready to share it with New York in Brahms's Violin Concerto, with Anne-Sophie Mutter as soloist, and Mahler's First Symphony. Feb. 9. Carnegie Hall.
 CINCINNATI SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA To judge from recordings and all reports, Paavo Jarvi has this orchestra playing consistently at the highest level. Lutoslawski's gripping Concerto for Orchestra should tell whatever there is to say about that. The rest is gravy: Bartok's Third Piano Concerto, with Radu Lupu as soloist; Ravel's ''Ma Mere l'Oye'' Suite; and the Bach-Webern Ricercare. Feb. 15. Carnegie Hall.
 ROYAL CONCERTGEBOUW ORCHESTRA What are the odds, in a long New York season, that two of the most prominent Dutch orchestras would come to play a mere two evenings each in different halls and collide on one of those evenings? Mariss Jansons conducts this great band in Sibelius's Violin Concerto (with Janine Jansen as soloist), Rachmaninoff's Second Symphony and -- as the Rotterdam Philharmonic sets up shop in Avery Fisher Hall -- Mahler's Third Symphony. How do you say indecision and consternation in Dutch? Feb. 16-17. Carnegie Hall.
 ROTTERDAM PHILHARMONIC ORCHESTRA The young Canadian conductor Yannick Nezet-Seguin arrived for his New York debut, with the Mostly Mozart Festival at Lincoln Center in August, trailing raves from abroad. The modest acclaim here came couched in the caveat that we wouldn't really learn much about him until he came with an orchestra of his own. Here is one (he is also music director of the Orchestre Metropolitain in Montreal), and the two programs -- with Strauss's ''Heldenleben,'' Bartok's Concerto for Orchestra and works by Brahms, Liszt, Messiaen and Theo Verbey -- should reveal much about conductor and orchestra. Feb. 17, 19. Avery Fisher Hall.
 ORCHESTRA OF ST. LUKE'S The conductor Roger Norrington earned his early-music spurs in the 1980s with his invigorating interpretations and recordings of the Beethoven symphonies, which tried to make sense of the quick tempos specified by metronome markings that had long been thought flawed. His recording of the Ninth Symphony, in particular, seemed radical. Now Mr. Norrington, who was music director of this orchestra from 1990 to 1994, returns to conduct the Beethoven Ninth with the Westminster Symphonic Choir and the vocal soloists Jessica Rivera, Kelley O'Connor, Eric Cutler and Wayne Tigges. The performance will be dedicated to Marianne C. Lockwood, a co-founder of the orchestra and its president for all of its 35 years, who will retire after the season. Feb. 21. Carnegie Hall.
 'ATTILA' The Met, to say the least, was not always as welcoming to world-class maestros as it has in recent years become. (Remember all those nights of Nello Santi?) So at 68, Riccardo Muti, the world's reigning Verdian, finally makes his house debut: one of several prominent ones here, including those of Miuccia Prada (of ''Devil'' fame) and Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron (of Beijing ''Bird's Nest'' fame) in set and costume design. Ildar Abdrazakov is Attila opposite Violeta Urmana as Odabella. Opens Feb. 23. Metropolitan Opera House.
 MARYINSKY THEATER Big and burly works Berlioz's dramatic symphony ''Romeo et Juliette'' and his opera ''Les Troyens'' undoubtedly are. (''Troyens,'' in fact, is presented here over two evenings.) But for the conductor Valery Gergiev -- the hard-charging artistic director of the Maryinsky Theater in St. Petersburg, which supplies the orchestra, chorus and soloists -- all this amounts to little more than training for his guest stint with the New York Philharmonic in the spring, a juggernaut Stravinsky festival. Feb. 23, March 9-10. Carnegie Hall. 
 ANDRAS SCHIFF Even after his extended surveys of Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert and others, this pianist remains most closely associated with Bach, an identification only intensified by the revisiting of one of his early triumphs, the keyboard partitas, in a new recording from ECM. But many of the same qualities that serve him so well in Bach -- variety of touch, clarity of texture, fluidity of line, dry wit -- prove equally valuable in the music of Haydn, and Mr. Schiff's three Haydn programs here (the second a chamber concert, the third a lecture-recital), though late for the Haydn year, should be treasurable. Feb. 25, 27-28. 92nd Street Y.
 MARCH
 MINNESOTA ORCHESTRA Even with Mid-American orchestras perhaps underrepresented at Carnegie in recent years, this ensemble seems to have carved out a small but permanent niche during the music directorship of Osmo Vanska. Typically, he plies his current specialties: Beethoven, with the ''Grosse Fuge'' in an arrangement by Michael Steinberg, a musicologist and friend of this orchestra and several others, who died in July; and Sibelius, with the choral symphony ''Kullervo.'' March 1. Carnegie Hall.
 LONDON PHILHARMONIC ORCHESTRA For a time, there was a lot of excited talk about the youngish Russian conductor Vladimir Jurowski: in particular, as a possibility to take on the vacant music directorship of the Philadelphia Orchestra. The general ardor seems to have cooled as other, younger maestros have come to the fore, and at the moment there doesn't seem to be much talk of anything orchestral in Philadelphia. Mr. Jurowski, in any case, remains principal conductor of this orchestra (with one of those younger lions, Yannick Nezet-Seguin, newly installed as principal guest conductor), and he leads it here in thoroughly conventional programs of Beethoven and Brahms, Ravel and Shostakovich. March 1, 7. Avery Fisher Hall.
 'COSI FAN TUTTE' In March the Cleveland Orchestra performed Mozart's ''Nozze di Figaro,'' presenting staged opera in Severance Hall with the players in the pit for the first time since the 1970s. Here it continues its cycle of the three Mozart operas to librettos by Lorenzo da Ponte, with ''Don Giovanni'' to follow next season. Again, the sets and costumes come from the Zurich Opera, and again, the staging is likely to be modest at best. The playing should be anything but modest. Franz Welser-Most conducts a cast including Malin Hartelius as Fiordiligi and Ruben Drole as Guglielmo. March 2, 4, 6, 8. Severance Hall, Cleveland, (216) 231-1111 or (800) 686-1141.
 'THE NOSE' The Metropolitan Opera offers its first production of Shostakovich's opera, directed by William Kentridge and conducted initially by Valery Gergiev. Opens March 5. Metropolitan Opera House.
 'SIMPLY SCHUMANN' Mendelssohn is so last year. Now it is Schumann's turn, in his bicentenary year. In what is characterized as a minimarathon, a panel discussion precedes performances of piano, vocal and chamber works by the pianist Michael Boriskin and others. March 12. Symphony Space.
 'HAMLET' If it's Shakespeare you're dealing with (more or less, after Ambroise Thomas's musical ministrations), you want real acting, no? And here are two singing actors who represent the current state of that hybrid art: Simon Keenlyside and Natalie Dessay. Patrice Caurier and Moshe Leiser direct a production taken over from Geneva by way of London, and Louis Langree conducts. Opens March 16. Metropolitan Opera House.
 MARK LAMOS This stimulating director pretty much dominates the New York City Opera's spring season, at least in concept, with revivals of his productions of Chabrier's ''Etoile'' here and Puccini's ''Madama Butterfly'' a day later. The company's final offering, on April 3, is Handel's ''Partenope,'' in a revival of the production by Francisco Negrin. March 18. David H. Koch Theater.
 SAN FRANCISCO SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA Having completed their recorded cycle of the Mahler symphonies, Michael Tilson Thomas and the orchestra return to the ''Resurrection'' (as who wouldn't?) in the second of these concerts, with the Westminster Symphonic Choir, the soprano Laura Claycomb and the mezzo-soprano Katarina Karneus. The combination of works in the first program may come across better in performance than it looks on paper: Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto (with Christian Tetzlaff as soloist), Ravel's ''Valses Nobles et Sentimentales,'' Liszt's ''Tasso'' and a new work by Victor Kissine still untitled at press time. March 25-26. Carnegie Hall. 
 'BEETHOVEN THEN AND NOW' Beethoven symphonies are certainly nothing new in the Great Performers series at Lincoln Center. Among other, scattered outings in recent years, Bernard Haitink conducted all nine with the London Symphony Orchestra in Avery Fisher Hall in 2006, and Paavo Jarvi led the Deutsche Kammerphilharmonie Bremen in four of them in the newly renovated Alice Tully Hall in March. The angle this time is to hear how -- at an advanced stage of the early-music movement, now largely assimilated into the mainstream -- performances by a period-instrument orchestra might compare with those by a modern one. In A/B tests of a sort, Ivan Fischer will conduct the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment in five symphonies and the Budapest Festival Orchestra in two at Alice Tully Hall. But that more or less direct comparison breaks down with a move to Avery Fisher Hall for the last concert, with the Budapest ensemble playing the ''Pastoral'' Symphony and the mighty Ninth. Then again, how much does any of that matter? Is it possible that a strong conductor makes all the difference? Or all the similarity? March 25-28.
 THOMAS ADES This multifacted musician -- composer, conductor and pianist -- first came to wide attention in New York in 1998, when his sex-steeped opera ''Powder Her Face'' ran at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Now, returning as pianist, he again presents ''Powder Her Face,'' or rather four scenes from it -- but with or without the fellatio aria? In Zankel Hall in 2007, he played only 20th-century works. Here, in the Stern Auditorium, he performs works by Janacek and Prokofiev but leavens the program with music of Beethoven, Schubert and Liszt. March 27. Carnegie Hall.
 IAN BOSTRIDGE An early brochure promised Schubert, and it would have been great. We know that because we've heard a lot of Schubert from this sensitive tenor. All the more reason to welcome the shift here to Brahms, whose songs are a trove less explored. With Julius Drake as the pianist, this Brahms recital should be priceless. March 31. Alice Tully Hall.
 JULIA FISCHER If you have to miss Christian Tetzlaff's performances of the Bach sonatas and partitas for unaccompanied violin in October, or even if you don't, you may want to hear those of another splendid German violinist following hard on his heels. These performances also promise to be special. March 31-April 1. Zankel Hall.
 APRIL
 HELMUT LACHENMANN The late addition of this uncompromising German modernist to the Composer Portraits series by Melissa Smey after she was named the Miller Theater's new director presumably augurs something for the direction of its future programming: if nothing else, that it intends to maintain its seriousness of purpose. To celebrate Mr. Lachenmann's 75th birthday, he, as pianist, the Jack Quartet, the instrumental ensemble Signal and others will perform an evening of his music combined with discussion. April 1. Miller Theater.
 'ELIJAH' The young Chinese bass-baritone Shenyang is new to me, but if James Levine and the Boston Symphony Orchestra are willing to stake their presentation of Mendelssohn's great oratorio on his performance of the title role, this could be an ''Elijah'' to remember (no matter that the Mendelssohn year will have passed). Certainly the female contingent is strong, with Christine Brewer and Stephanie Blythe. April 5. Carnegie Hall.
 LOUIS ANDRIESSEN To begin a monthlong celebration of this Dutch composer at Carnegie Hall, Jeffrey Milarsky conducts the American Composers Orchestra in ''Louis and the New Generation.'' Alongside the Symphony for Open Strings by Mr. Andriessen, the program includes music by three of his recent students, Missy Mazzoli, Michael Fiday and John Korsrud. April 9. Zankel Hall.
 'ARMIDA' The third time, Mary Zimmerman must fondly hope, is the charm. Her first two productions at the Met -- Donizetti's ''Lucia di Lammermoor'' and Bellini's ''Sonnambula,'' both starring Natalie Dessay -- were widely regarded as bombs, and even Ms. Dessay seemed ready to throw Ms. Zimmerman overboard in comments she made after ''Sonnambula.'' Perhaps Gluck's opera, with its supernatural interventions, will suit Ms. Zimmerman's style better. Either way, with Renee Fleming as the star, the production will not be ignored. Opens April 12. Metropolitan Opera House.
 MAURIZIO POLLINI This respected pianist -- to be featured in the series Great Pianists Play Chopin on Film at Lincoln Center in February, as the 1960 winner of the Chopin competition in Warsaw -- can also be heard doing so live in the Chopin bicentennial year. In three programs, he covers the Second and Third Sonatas, the Opus 28 Preludes, the Opus 25 Etudes and many other works. April 18, 29; May 9. Carnegie Hall.
 THE RUSSIAN STRAVINSKY During Lorin Maazel's years as music director, the New York Philharmonic liked to gather a slightly larger concentration of, say, Beethoven or Tchaikovsky than usual into a few weeks, spiff it up ever so slightly in rehearsal and call it a festival. This one won't be so easy. Much of the music is inherently more difficult, starting with ''The Rite of Spring.'' (Yes, I know, the Philharmonic can play it in its sleep and often does, but let's hope for better than that. This is a festival.) And much of it is less familiar to the orchestra, like the opera ''Oedipus Rex.'' With Valery Gergiev conducting a kaleidoscopic array of programs over more than two weeks, the orchestra will undoubtedly be grateful for its labor contracts governing rehearsal time, as anyone who has seen Mr. Gergiev work with his own Kirov Orchestra of St. Petersburg can attest. April 21-May 8. Avery Fisher Hall.
 AMERICAN CLASSICAL ORCHESTRA It may come as a surprise to New Yorkers to learn that this period-instrument band is 25 years old. A surprise because the orchestra grew up in Connecticut and was, until 10 years ago, rather narrowly called the Orchestra of the Old Fairfield Academy. But having claimed America as its oyster, it has expanded its New York presence over the last decade. And it positively demands attention with its anniversary concert, featuring a performance of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony at the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine, with massed choirs. Thomas Crawford, the orchestra's founder and music director, conducts a program that also includes Handel's Coronation Anthems. April 24. Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine, 1047 Amsterdam Avenue, (212) 362-2727; americanclassicalorchestra.org. 
 'MOBY-DICK' In a bid to sustain the excitement aroused by the opening of its new home, the Dallas Opera offers the premiere of a work by Jake Heggie to a libretto by Gene Scheer. The tenor Ben Heppner, if in good stentorian voice, should be ideal for the role of Captain Ahab. Leonard Foglia directs, and Patrick Summers conducts. Opens April 30. Winspear Opera House, (214) 443-1000, dallasopera.org.
 MAY
 JORDI SAVALL Any term you apply to him -- musician? musicologist? violist da gamba? conductor? music director? -- is too limiting. Mr. Savall's work embodies an astonishingly fertile blend of musiciality and scholarship. Here he presents two programs that will inevitably number among the season's highlights: ''Orient-Occident: A Dialogue of Cultures'' and ''Jerusalem: City of Heavenly and Earthly Peace.'' If you have any doubt, check out the recordings on the Alia Vox label (if recording, again, is not too limiting a term for ''Jerusalem,'' a hardcover book of more than 400 pages with two CDs). May 2. Allen Room. May 3. Rose Theater.
 'AMELIA' With everything Speight Jenkins has accomplished in his 26 years as general director of the Seattle Opera, it comes as a surprise that he has not commissioned a new opera. Until now. Daron Aric Hagen, perhaps best known to the opera world for ''The Shining Brow,'' based on the life of Frank Lloyd Wright, is the composer. Gardner McFall is the librettist, setting a story by Stephen Wadsworth inspired in turn by Ms. McFall's collection of poems ''The Pilot's Daughter,'' stemming from the loss of her father in the Vietnam War. Again in turn, Mr. Wadsworth directs. Kate Lindsey sings the title role, and Gerard Schwarz conducts. Opens May 8. Marion Oliver McCaw Hall, Seattle, (206) 389-7676 or (800) 426-1619, seattleopera.org.
 EMERSON STRING QUARTET Adventure is where you find it, and this veteran ensemble has had to seek it out, having largely exhausted the tidy quartet packages: the Beethovens, the Bartoks, the Shostakoviches. Its series Adventures in Bohemia offers three evenings of Dvorak (''The Folk Music,'' ''The Late Quartets'' and ''From the New World''), each laced with a work by Janacek or Martinu. What it may lose in tidiness and inherent logic, it more than gains in color and flavor. May 9, 16, 19. Alice Tully Hall.
 'WALL TO WALL BEHIND THE WALL' As name and concept, it's a little more unwieldy -- a lot, actually -- than, say, ''Wall to Wall Bach'' or ''Wall to Wall Broadway.'' Symphony Space fills its 12-hour slot this season with music representing Eastern Europe from the end of World War I to the fall of the Berlin Wall. There will be music by, let me get this right, ''composers as diverse as Shostakovich, Prokofiev, Khachaturian, Lutoslawski, Schnittke, Ligeti, Penderecki, Mansurian, Shafaryan, Bardanashvili, Gorecki, Kancheli, Panufnik, Gubaidulina, Part, Ustvolskaya, Kurtag and others.'' And that's without ''younger composers who came of age during the Soviet regime.'' There will be gems, count on it. But in all probability, there will also be dross. Where is that flask of slivovitz when you need it? May 15. Symphony Space.
 MET ORCHESTRA Pierre Boulez picks up pretty much where he leaves off in the Chicago Symphony concerts in January, with vintage Bartok, ''The Wooden Prince,'' and adds another 20th-century monument, Schoenberg's ''Erwartung,'' with the soprano Deborah Polaski. May 16. Carnegie Hall.
 LOS ANGELES PHILHARMONIC But seriously, folks, it hasn't really happened until it happens in New York, right? (No, not seriously; to quote that latter-day denizen of Los Angeles Craig Ferguson, it's just a joke.) With most of a season as music director behind him, the young dynamo Gustavo Dudamel shows off his charges in works of Bernstein (''Remind you of anyone?'' as Mr. Ferguson would say) and Tchaikovsky, and with the program that opens his tenure in Los Angeles in October, John Adams's ''City Noir'' and Mahler's First Symphony. May 20, 22. Avery Fisher Hall.
 CLEVELAND ORCHESTRA Even before it developed a specialty in out-of-town residencies, this great ensemble would typically move into Carnegie Hall for several concerts each season. Here it settles for a quick hit, a single program of Berg's ''Lulu'' Suite and Beethoven's ''Eroica'' Symphony: scarcely enough to rouse that hardy perennial, the debate over Franz Welser-Most's achievements as the orchestra's music director and his sometimes willful interpretations (or what some have called a lack of interpretation). It's time for the orchestra to come with a big Bruckner symphony or two, to show what Mr. Welser-Most does best and just how grand the orchestra can sound under him, to help put the rest in context. May 21. Carnegie Hall.
 'LE GRAND MACABRE' Alan Gilbert is saving one of his boldest strokes at the New York Philharmonic -- a semistaged version of Gyorgy Ligeti's avant-gardist opera, first performed in 1978 -- until late in the season, presumably calculating that he will by then have won over a notoriously unadventurous audience. Will listeners who often bail out on even mildly challenging music placed after intermission sit still for an evening-long contemplation of last things, however fancifully and bawdily framed? If not, they will miss the message, a cheery injunction to fear not the day of judgment but live happily in the present. May 27-29. Avery Fisher Hall.
 JUNE
 'MISSA SOLEMNIS' You have to hope that there will be a honeymoon period for Alan Gilbert as music director of the New York Philharmonic, that the honeymoon will last and that he will want to sing hymns of thanksgiving by the end of the season. On the other hand, given this orchestra's history with its maestros, there is at least a possibility that he will be pleading for mercy, Either way, the prayerful work he has chosen for his last subscription program, Beethoven's glorious Mass setting, should serve him well. June 23-24, 26. Avery Fisher Hall. June 25. New Jersey Performing Arts Center, Newark, (888) 466-5722, njpac.org.

HEADLINE: Foreign Languages Fall as Schools Look for Cuts

BYLINE: By WINNIE HU

 BODY:
IN Edgemont, a high-performing Westchester school district, children as young as 7 could recite colors and days of the week in Spanish, but few if any learned to really converse, read or write. So this fall, the district canceled the Spanish lessons offered twice weekly at its two elementary schools since 2003, deciding the time and resources -- an estimated $175,000 a year -- could be better spent on other subjects. 
 Class consolidation in Yonkers resulted in the loss of four foreign-language teaching positions, and budget cuts have cost Arlington, N.Y., its seventh-grade German program, and Danbury, Conn., several sections of middle school French and Spanish. 
And in New Jersey, the Ridgewood district is replacing its three elementary school Spanish teachers with Rosetta Stone, an interactive computer program that cost $70,000, less than half their combined salaries.
 ''There's never a replacement for a teacher in the classroom,'' said Debra Anderson, a Ridgewood spokeswoman. ''But this was a good solution in view of the financial constraints.''
 After years of expanding language offerings, suburban districts across the New York region are now cutting back on staff and instructional time, phasing out less popular languages, and rethinking whether they can really afford to introduce foreign tongues to their youngest students while under constant pressure to downsize budgets and raise achievement in English and other core subjects.
 But such cuts have dismayed and frustrated some educators and parents, who say that children need more, not fewer, foreign language skills to compete in a global marketplace. 
 ''In many cultures, a lot of business does not get done around the business table, it gets done in side conversations and social situations,'' said Marty Abbott, director of education for the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages and a former high school Spanish and Latin teacher. ''If you can't participate in those discussions, you get left out.'' 
 Foreign languages play an increasingly prominent role in urban schools that serve diverse ethnic communities. For instance, the New York City schools offered courses in Haitian-Creole, Vietnamese, and Portuguese last year, and opened the first public school dedicated to Arabic language and culture in Brooklyn in 2007. Last week, the city's first Hebrew-language charter school opened, also in Brooklyn.
 Advocates for foreign-language instruction would like to see the lessons integrated into the core curriculum rather than treated as electives easy to ax at budget time. They also say that instruction should begin as early as possible -- ideally in preschool -- because academic research shows that younger children are more accepting of other cultures and better able to master the pronunciation and intonation of foreign words. Some even contend that learning a foreign language can foster cognitive skills that lead to higher standardized test scores in other subjects.
 On Long Island, more than 200 residents of Long Beach signed petitions over the summer opposing the district's decision to phase out a dual-language English-Spanish program at Lido Elementary School that had served as a model for other districts. 
 ''I think it's a terrible shame,'' said Sebastian Arengo, a software engineer, whose 6-year-old twin daughters are in the program. ''It's at the right age for kids to speak both languages, and it's also a great way to bring the English-speaking and Spanish-speaking communities together here in Long Beach.''
 Robert Greenberg, superintendent of the 4,000-student Long Beach district, said that the program had been created mainly to help Spanish-speaking students learn English through bilingual classes, but that it has evolved into an immersion program for those who want to learn Spanish. ''I have Latino families wanting me to teach their children Spanish, but that's not the intent of the program,'' he said.
 Separate from the dual-language program, the district has provided 90 minutes a week of Spanish instruction to all kindergarten and first-grade students since 2007, and plans to expand that program by one grade every year. ''We made an instructional decision that we're teaching all children Spanish rather than a few,'' he said.
 Many superintendents say they remain committed to teaching languages, but simply cannot afford to do more at this time. In Rockland County, the 9,400-student Clarkstown district spent about $60,000 last year to hire a full-time Spanish teacher for one of its 10 elementary schools but postponed plans to do the same at the other schools this fall ''until we determine the economy is getting better,'' said Meg Keller-Cogan, the superintendent. 
 In Connecticut, the New Hartford district cut its one foreign language teacher at Ann Antolini Elementary School from full time to three days a week to save $35,000. Fewer hours mean that Spanish will no longer be taught to third and fourth graders. ''It was just for budget reasons and it was a very painful decision,'' said Philip O'Reilly, the superintendent, adding that other staff members had hours reduced -- and two were laid off -- to cut costs.
 Some educators said they were re-evaluating foreign-language programs not just because of finances but to update them and incorporate new technology. The Ridgewood district, which started twice-weekly Spanish lessons at its elementary schools in 2005, said its interactive software, made by Rosetta Stone, allows students to learn at their own pace.
 The 10,400-student Arlington district decided to phase out German -- leaving Spanish, French and Italian -- because it was the least popular choice among students; last year, 44 seventh graders enrolled in introductory German compared to more than 300 in Spanish. The district also phased out Russian more than a decade ago.
 ''It was a low-fill, high-cost area of instruction, and if that wasn't taken, something else would have been,'' said Frank V. Pepe Jr., the superintendent.
 The district will continue to require every student to study a foreign language in seventh and eighth grade; nearly a quarter of all students study a language through their junior or senior year, according to district officials.
 ''I'm not pleased we eliminated German,'' Mr. Pepe said. ''I'm not pleased at all.''

HEADLINE: Turning to Windmills, But Resistance Lingers

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH

DATELINE: BOURNE, Mass. 

 BODY:
Wendie Howland grows her own food and heats her water with rooftop solar panels. She drives a Prius with a bumper sticker that boasts ''One Less S.U.V.''
 But when Mrs. Howland tried to take the next step in green living -- installing a 132-foot windmill in her backyard that would generate enough electricity to power her home -- she hit a wall. The planning board in this pastoral Cape Cod town twice rejected the project citing safety concerns and predicting ''an adverse effect on the character of the neighborhood.'' 
 Mrs. Howland's defeat was sealed by a Superior Court ruling in July that backed the planning board's decision, underscoring the steep odds that residential windmill plans face nationwide. After investing some $40,000 in a 10-kilowatt turbine and legal fees, Mrs. Howland and her husband, Francis, are giving up their two-year fight.
 ''It's ludicrous,'' said Mrs. Howland, 58, a health care consultant. ''We were trying to make our bills smaller as we got older, in a clean and responsible fashion, and it boggles my mind that ordinary people like us aren't allowed to do that.'' 
 The decision is likely to be scrutinized by towns across the region and even the nation as they grapple with how to regulate windmills on residential property. In wind-rich regions, clashes like Mrs. Howland's are increasingly common as conservation-minded people seek to install small wind turbines on their property. 
 Battles over the height and noise level of residential windmills, and even over the shadows cast by their blades, are springing up from Maine to California, even as the Obama administration promotes renewable energy and the federal stimulus package provides 30 percent tax credits for homeowners who install wind turbines. 
 Many towns still enforce old laws that prohibit anything taller than 30 feet or 40 feet on residential land -- a height too low for sufficient wind power generation, experts say. Wind turbines need to be at least 30 feet higher than anything within 500 feet, including trees, which often means a tower of 80 feet or more. The Howlands' windmill would have been more than three times the height of an average utility pole, to ensure that the surrounding white pines did not interfere. 
 ''Everyone recoils at that,'' said Jonathan D. Fitch, the Howlands' lawyer. ''It reminds me of the litigation involving cell towers in the beginning -- a lot of neighborhood hostility back then, but today you hardly notice them.''
 Even before the Howland case, Cape Cod was a battleground in the windmill debate: a proposal to build the nation's first offshore wind farm has met with stiff opposition from those who say the project would spoil the natural beauty of Nantucket Sound.
 While residential turbines remain a tiny fraction of the wind energy market, they are popping up often enough for many communities, especially in New England, the Midwest and the West, to start regulating them. Nearly 2,700 wind units with capacities of 10 kilowatts or less, the size used for residences, were sold nationwide last year, up from 1,167 in 2007, according to the American Wind Energy Association, a trade group. 
 But challenges persist even in communities that have passed ordinances on windmills, like Bourne, where residents overwhelmingly approved a bylaw regulating windmills at a town meeting in 2007. The wind energy association estimates that one-third of small wind projects are thwarted by vague or overly strict local laws, or by outdated zoning rules that preclude them. 
 ''It's mostly that they will make the rules so prohibitive that they essentially ban installations,'' said Ron Stimmel, the association's small wind advocate. ''There are humongous hurdles that no other type of installation has been faced with.'' 
 In Waukee, Iowa, the City Council is considering a law that would ''allow and encourage'' the use of small wind-energy systems but would ban them on single-family homes. In Islip, N.Y., a new provision allows residents to install windmills up to 45 feet tall -- probably not high enough to make the investment worthwhile, Mr. Stimmel said. 
 And in Bourne, a town of about 19,000, the 2007 bylaw limits residential windmills to 75 feet high unless the homeowner can prove that a taller windmill is needed and would not ''increase any adverse impacts.'' 
 In July, during the Howlands' trial, Brian Wall, a lawyer for Bourne, told Judge Christopher Muse of Barnstable County Superior Court that the Howlands had not provided enough evidence that their windmill would be quiet and safe. 
 ''If this 1,600-pound thing falls or something falls off it in the area around it,'' he said, citing the possibility of ice flying off the blades in winter, ''it needs to be safe.'' 
 Mr. Wall said the town needed an engineer's guarantee that in heavy winds the windmill would not crash onto neighboring homes -- the closest is 105 feet from its proposed base -- even though its pole is designed to fold in such weather, not break apart. 
 He added that no qualified engineer had certified that the windmill would be quiet or that its ''shadow flicker'' -- the strobe of sunlight passing through rotating blades -- would not bother the Howlands' neighbors. 
 In his ruling, Judge Muse wrote that while he did not believe the windmill would pose a safety threat, the planning board's decision fell within its discretion and was not ''unreasonable, whimsical, capricious or arbitrary.'' 
 Megan Amsel of the Cape and Islands Self Reliance Corporation, a nonprofit group that promotes alternative energy in Cape Cod and southeastern Massachusetts, said she had seen some disastrous wind projects -- not because they proved unsafe, but because they did not generate enough power. 
 ''It's really hard to find a good installer,'' she said, adding that there are no certification requirements. ''I've seen some real disasters, and it can give this emerging industry a black eye.'' 
 The wind needs to blow at least 12 miles an hour for a turbine to generate electricity -- a requirement that rules out many sites -- and the initial cost is steep. Mr. Stimmel said that the average cost of buying and installing a residential turbine was $30,000, and that it took 6 years to 30 years to recover that cost through energy savings. 
 The total cost for the Howlands' turbine, including installation, would be $72,000, they said.
 To Mrs. Howland, the town's claim that a windmill would hurt the character of her neighborhood was especially galling. None of her closest neighbors objected, she said. 
 ''There is no aesthetic clause in the bylaw because aesthetics are subjective,'' she said. ''For every person I know who says, 'I don't like it,' I hear another say, 'I think they're beautiful.' ''

HEADLINE: Across Great Divide, East Meets West at Mystic Ballet

BYLINE: By SYLVIANE GOLD

 BODY:
COWBOYS, Mozart and Picasso might not at first glance seem to belong together in one artistic venture. But who would expect to find a Russian-born, Bolshoi-trained choreographer like Sergei Vanaev making ballets in coastal Connecticut? 
 Perhaps his ''El Paso Requiem'' shouldn't be that much of a surprise, then, despite its combining the elemental grandeur of Mozart's Requiem with imagery borrowed from the Old West and from Picasso's famous Spanish Civil War mural, ''Guernica'' -- not to mention a dash of Mexican-flavored electronic music by Michael Brook as well. Mr. Vanaev comes by his mix-and-match esthetic naturally: He is a product of the East with a bifurcated life in the West. He runs the Stadttheater Bremerhaven Ballet in Germany and is resident choreographer and assistant artistic director for the ambitious little Mystic Ballet, which will present the world premiere of ''El Paso Requiem'' and several other works on Sept. 26 and Oct. 24 at the Mashantucket Pequot Auditorium. 
 The bill, which has been christened ''G.R.A.B.'' (for ''Genuine Resurrection of Artistic Bond'') by Goran Subotic, the company's prime mover, includes Mr. Vanaev's ''Triple Fall,'' a trio set to music by Cesar Franck and Viktor Wlassow. 
 In a telephone interview from Germany, Mr. Vanaev, 42, described it as an abstract piece that's meant to prompt reflection. ''It's based probably on my own life experience now,'' he said. ''I'm not very old, not very young; I'm hanging somewhere in between, asking questions.''
 He calls his ''No Pas de Deux'' a ''sarcastic joke,'' built on the music for one of classical ballet's flashiest duets, the ''Don Quixote'' pas de deux, but employing eight dancers and exploring the ''magnetic field'' that joins couples and separates them from others.
 ''El Paso'' is the closing piece, centering on a gunslinger about to draw his weapon and precipitate an onrush of memory embodied by 13 other dancers.
 Mr. Vanaev's choreography will be augmented by three classical duets, including the Black Swan pas de deux from ''Swan Lake,'' he said, ''to show what the Mystic dancers can do, to show they are really good enough to manage this.''
 The concert is something of a milestone for the company, which was founded in 1997 by Mr. Subotic and his wife, Desiree, a former dancer. At a reception before the concert, the Town of Stonington will honor Mystic Ballet and kick off a campaign to establish Mystic as the home of an annual dance festival. 
 Mr. Subotic's infectious enthusiasm has guided the company from its beginnings as a local ballet school to its current professional status, and that's the trait that impressed Mr. Vanaev. ''Why is Goran's project growing like crazy even with the economic crisis?'' he asked. ''It's not only about clever management. It's about his energy and his extreme love for dancers, for choreographers, for people in dance world.''
 Mr. Vanaev said he thought the time was right for contemporary ballet to grow in the United States. In Europe, he said, ''the contemporary ballet is very developed and is changing very quick. Choreographers all know each other; they are very curious, very hungry. Exchanges happen, because the distances are small.''
 Traveling as he does between Europe and the States, Mr. Vanaev has to deal with distances that are not so small. But he said he didn't mind. For one thing, his wife is American born, so it gives them and their two children a chance to visit family. It also provides artistic sustenance. ''It's good to change the brain,'' he said. ''The things I'm doing in Mystic are completely different from what I'm doing here in Germany. I cannot explain why. It's something nuclear, in the air.''
 ''G.R.A.B.,'' a program of six works by the Mystic Ballet, is at the Mashantucket Pequot Auditorium, Mashantucket, Sept. 26 at 7 p.m. and Oct. 24 at 4:30 p.m. Information: mysticballet.org or (860) 536-3671 .

HEADLINE: Wall Street's Math Wizards Forgot a Few Variables

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
IN the aftermath of the great meltdown of 2008, Wall Street's quants have been cast as the financial engineers of profit-driven innovation run amok. They, after all, invented the exotic securities that proved so troublesome.
 But the real failure, according to finance experts and economists, was in the quants' mathematical models of risk that suggested the arcane stuff was safe. 
 The risk models proved myopic, they say, because they were too simple-minded. They focused mainly on figures like the expected returns and the default risk of financial instruments. What they didn't sufficiently take into account was human behavior, specifically the potential for widespread panic. When lots of investors got too scared to buy or sell, markets seized up and the models failed. 
 That failure suggests new frontiers for financial engineering and risk management, including trying to model the mechanics of panic and the patterns of human behavior. 
 ''What wasn't recognized was the importance of a different species of risk -- liquidity risk,'' said Stephen Figlewski, a professor of finance at the Leonard N. Stern School of Business at New York University. ''When trust in counterparties is lost, and markets freeze up so there are no prices,'' he said, it ''really showed how different the real world was from our models.''
 In the future, experts say, models need to be opened up to accommodate more variables and more dimensions of uncertainty.
 The drive to measure, model and perhaps even predict waves of group behavior is an emerging field of research that can be applied in fields well beyond finance.
 Much of the early work has been done tracking online behavior. The Web provides researchers with vast data sets for tracking the spread of all manner of things -- news stories, ideas, videos, music, slang and popular fads -- through social networks. That research has potential applications in politics, public health, online advertising and Internet commerce. And it is being done by academics and researchers at Google, Microsoft, Yahoo and Facebook.
 Financial markets, like online communities, are social networks. Researchers are looking at whether the mechanisms and models being developed to explore collective behavior on the Web can be applied to financial markets. A team of six economists, finance experts and computer scientists at Cornell was recently awarded a grant from the National Science Foundation to pursue that goal.
 ''The hope is to take this understanding of contagion and use it as a perspective on how rapid changes of behavior can spread through complex networks at work in financial markets,'' explained Jon M. Kleinberg, a computer scientist and social network researcher at Cornell.
 At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Andrew W. Lo, director of the Laboratory for Financial Engineering, is taking a different approach to incorporating human behavior into finance. His research focuses on applying insights from disciplines, including evolutionary biology and cognitive neuroscience, to create a new perspective on how financial markets work, which Mr. Lo calls ''the adaptive-markets hypothesis.'' It is a departure from the ''efficient-market'' theory, which asserts that financial markets always get asset prices right given the available information and that people always behave rationally.
 Efficient-market theory, of course, has dominated finance and econometric modeling for decades, though it is being sharply questioned in the wake of the financial crisis. ''It is not that efficient market theory is wrong, but it's a very incomplete model,'' Mr. Lo said.
 Mr. Lo is confident that his adaptive-markets approach can help model and quantify liquidity crises in a way traditional models, with their narrow focus on expected returns and volatility, cannot. ''We're going to see three-dimensional financial modeling and eventually N-dimensional modeling,'' he said.
 J. Doyne Farmer, a former physicist at Los Alamos National Laboratory and a founder of a quantitative trading firm, finds the behavioral research intriguing but awfully ambitious, especially to build into usable models. Instead, Mr. Farmer, a professor at the interdisciplinary Sante Fe Institute, is doing research on models of markets, institutions and their complex interactions, applying a hybrid discipline called econophysics.
 To explain, Mr. Farmer points to the huge buildup of the credit-default-swap market, to a peak of $60 trillion. And in 2006, the average leverage on mortgage securities increased to 16 to 1 (it is now 1.5 to 1). Put the two together, he said, and you have a serious problem. 
 ''You don't need a model of human psychology to see that there was a danger of impending disaster,'' Mr. Farmer observed. ''But economists have failed to make models that accurately model such phenomena and adequately address their couplings.''
 When a bridge over a river collapses, the engineers who built the bridge have to take responsibility. But typically, critics call for improvement and smarter, better-trained engineers -- not fewer of them. The same pattern seems to apply to financial engineers. At M.I.T., the Sloan School of Management is starting a one-year master's in finance this fall because the field has become too complex to be adequately covered as part of a traditional M.B.A. program, and because of student demand. The new finance program, Mr. Lo noted, had 179 applicants for 25 places. 
 In the aftermath of the economic crisis, financial engineers, experts say, will probably shift more to risk management and econometric analysis and concentrate less on devising exotic new instruments. Still, the recent efforts by investment banks to create a trading market for ''life settlements,'' life insurance policies that the ill or elderly sell for cash, suggest that inventive sales people are browsing for new asset classes to securitize, bundle and trade.
 ''Good or bad, moral or immoral, people are going to make markets and trade via computers, and this is a natural area of financial engineers,'' says Emanuel Derman, a professor at Columbia University and a former Wall Street quant.

HEADLINE: Is That Tub a Planter or an Eyesore?

BYLINE: By LISA PREVOST

DATELINE: MONTVILLE 

 BODY:
 YARDS filled with junk and rusting cars, broken-down fences, piles of debris -- these are some of the neighborhood scourges that Rosetta Jones hoped to eradicate here with a new ordinance prohibiting blight. 
 A first-term town councilor who has lived in this rural community for only three years, Ms. Jones figured that giving residents some recourse for the eyesore next door was a ''no brainer.'' 
 ''It's a historic problem here,'' she said. ''It's been a persistent problem for some time.'' 
 Her notion of a problem, however, looked more like a matter of personal choice to the longtime residents who turned out at a Town Council meeting earlier this summer to oppose a blight ordinance. Among them was Gary O'Bern, 68, a retired resident of Montville who calls such ordinances ''terribly un-American.'' 
 Standing in his dirt driveway on a recent afternoon, an American flag fluttering above his head, Mr. O'Bern reiterated his view that it's nobody's business if a taxpayer wants to, say, put a bathtub in the front yard. Newcomers like Ms. Jones are ''unreasonable to think they can move in and expect things to change to their standards,'' he added. ''We're all individuals.''
 At a time that rising foreclosures and a tough economy are taking a noticeable toll on neighborhoods around the state, Montville is among a growing number of communities debating the adoption of new or tougher blight ordinances. Roughly 60 Connecticut municipalities, most of them larger, less rural communities, already have blight ordinances on the books, according to Robert S. Poliner, state ombudsman for property rights.
 State law authorizes municipalities to make and enforce regulations preventing housing blight, and to set fines for violations of up to $100 a day. The issue has proven so contentious in some places, however, that elected officials have backed off, citing concerns about property rights and constrained budgets. 
 In Montville, the Town Council voted down the blight ordinance in July. A primary objection was a provision that would allow residents to file blight complaints anonymously. 
 According to Ms. Jones, who headed the subcommittee that drafted the ordinance, without the shield of anonymity, residents might be afraid to report a neighbor. ''You never know what trigger it will take to push somebody over the edge,'' she said. 
 Mr. O'Bern is among those who oppose anonymous complaints, which he argues might lead to charges of blight as a form of harassment. 
 Town officials in Seymour, a community in the Naugatuck Valley, reeled in its blight ordinance after just two years on the books. One of the first provisions to go was the anonymous complaint system. 
 ''We don't want neighbors fighting with each other,'' said Robert Koskelowski, the first selectman. ''We had one situation where someone was cited for blight, and it turned out the person who complained lived three miles away.'' 
 The revised ordinance will also be less financially onerous. Instead of an across-the-board fine of $100 a day for noncompliance, the town will set categories of fines ranging from $5 a day upward, Mr. Koskelowski said. And cosmetic problems like peeling paint will no longer constitute blight. 
 In Plainville, in central Connecticut, a property owners' organization has requested that officials look into a blight ordinance, but the town manager, Robert Lee, has advised against it. While Plainville does have more blighted and abandoned properties of late, Mr. Lee said, 90 percent of the issues can be remedied through existing housing codes. 
 ''The other 10 percent is where blight ordinances get involved, with, like, how high your grass can be,'' he said. ''My concern with regards to that is we really don't have the staff to enforce it.'' 
 That response is of little comfort to John Susco, an elderly resident of Plainville who says he lives across the street from a house owned by an absentee landlord. A proponent of a blight ordinance, Mr. Susco said that this particular neighbor's yard is often ''in shambles,'' and brings down the value of surrounding properties. 
 Asked about the offending yard, Mr. Lee acknowledged that it has been periodically unkempt -- a broken fence, brush piles, an unregistered car. The town does its part to ''get the guy to clean up his yard,'' Mr. Lee said, adding that it looks fine right now. Compared with houses with collapsing roofs, the place does not fall under the category of blight, he said. 
 ''There's a difference between blight and someone being sloppy,'' Mr. Lee said. ''It isn't a black and white issue.'' 
 Anti-blight activists in Middletown have been pushing for a tougher ordinance for years, to no avail. Under the existing ordinance, the city puts vacant or decaying properties on a blight list. 
 The ordinance lacks a ''solid enforcement mechanism,'' however, so properties sit on the list indefinitely, said Izzi Greenberg, the executive director of North End Action Team (NEAT), a revitalization group representing a part of town with a high percentage of absentee landlords. ''Even the process of getting on the list is hazy,'' Ms. Greenberg said. 
 Earlier this year, NEAT invited city officials to a workshop to discuss the blight list, and wound up with an agreement to scrap the whole thing. An ordinance proposed in its place adds a code enforcement committee to keep tabs on problem properties, and imposes fines for noncompliance. The ordinance is to come before the Common Council for action this month. 
 ''The goal,'' Ms. Greenberg said, ''is to see that no building ever gets to an advanced blighted state.''
 Meanwhile, in Montville, Ms. Jones has not given up. She says that a revised ordinance is in the works.

BYLINE: By MANOHLA DARGIS and A. O. SCOTT

 BODY:
Here are some outtakes from our virtual conversation with seven movie distributors:. 
 THE CHANGING MOVIE LANDSCAPE AND THE OSCAR RACE
 MICHAEL BARKER, SONY PICTURES CLASSICS: From ''Tom Jones'' in 1963 to ''Slumdog Millionaire'': this year, the Academy Awards have always honored these ''midlevel'' pictures. These films over the years have been either made by the studios (''Five Easy Pieces,''''Ordinary People''), or an independent producer going through a studio (''Million Dollar Baby,''''Chariots of Fire'') , or films made or picked up by indie companies (''Z,''''Crash'') or studio divisions (''The Pianist,''''Howards End,''''Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,''''No Country for Old Men''). This is not going to stop because a few companies shut down. 
 In the history of the movie business, companies are replaced and change very quickly all the time. In fact, since the time the two companies you mention here have been shut down, three new independent companies have opened and already have Oscar-caliber films in release this year. The current economic crisis may cause these movies to have lower budgets and to be financed by new sources with new models, but they will continue to be made. 
 What has and will always be difficult to predict is which pictures will be the great ones and from exactly where they may emerge. This doesn't mean it is not a struggle. The independent film business has always been a struggle, now more than ever. There is no question we are all living the painful ramifications of the global economic downturn, but history has shown us that even in the worst of times a number of quality films somehow get made and released every year. I don't see that changing.
 THE EVER-ELUSIVE AUDIENCE
 JONATHAN SEHRING, IFC ENTERTAINMENT: There are definitely audiences out there for the number of films we release. The amount of money we spend in order to reach those audiences differs based upon how big we think those audiences are. I think those of us (specialized distributors) who survived the economic downturn did so due to sticking to some basic business principles. By definition we are in the specialized business. A successful independent/foreign-language release 20 years ago did a $500,000 gross. A runaway hit was anything over $5 million. The audience acceptance and appetite for American independent and foreign language film has indeed grown in the last 20 years, but so have other competitive entertainment options. 
 The success of Miramax in the '90s and subsequent big spending by studio specialty divisions may have created bigger box office returns on some films, but the cost of getting those grosses put all of those divisions out of business. I don't believe we are killing any competitors that approach this business in an economically prudent and rational manner. Sales agents creating bidding wars for films that can't generate the type of returns some of those companies paid hurt this segment of the film industry as much as Hollywood did by applying studio economics to a specialized business. More great movies are being made globally today than at any other time. The audiences for these movies are not just gray-haired or hipsters, we have found through our theater, both of our cable networks and our experience with VOD buyers that they can be anybody looking for a good movie or a new experience.
 FROM THE ART HOUSE TO YOUR HOUSE
 MR. BARKER: All of these new ways of seeing movies from VOD to downloads to the iPod are viable but no one has figured out yet how to adequately harness rampant piracy (especially the streaming piracy) or how to generate substantial enough revenue from all these new technologies. This is so important because of the current mad scramble to find revenue to replace lost DVD revenues, which used to be a mainstay for all of us for quite some time. These are the serious challenges for the next few years as windows and price points continue to be vital as they are negotiated and change. There is very much a place for new approaches and platforms, like those practiced by IFC and Magnolia, that capitalize, in their pursuit of success (financially and reaching a wider audience), on the individual assets and agendas that define their companies. There are new opportunities everywhere and at this transitional moment in the film business, there is probably a case to be made for most of them. 
 However, I do still very much believe that if a film in its initial theatrical release makes a strong enough impression on the public's mind, the table is set for long term success in all the other media generating revenue and keeping the film alive for years to come.
 BOB BERNEY, APPARITION: Home entertainment systems offer some great presentation opportunities. The accessibility of VOD increases the number of films available immediately. However, illegal downloads are taking their toll. It's a very different outlook in the indie world since the ''screener ban'' battle was fought a few years ago. Now the indies are well aware of the dangers of piracy and not tightly controlling the product. Widescreen format and killer sound design can be amazing on home systems, but cellphones don't seem conducive to the film experience. Small phone screens and other devices can be very handy to get people to the theaters with promotions, locations and show time information.
 HOWARD COHEN, ROADSIDE ATTRACTIONS: Because of the problems for indies, the day and date VOD concept, where the film is available in the whole country on VOD on or around the same day it's opening a few major cities, is a good one for smaller films, and it seems like an incremental revenue stream. It takes advantage of the publicity, making the film available instantly anywhere at the time you're reading The New York Times review and national reviews, and I seriously doubt it cannibalizes theatergoing for indies. There's no doubt it would cannibalize theatergoing on a ''Dark Knight'' or a ''Wolverine,'' . so I understand exhibition's fear of it as a wholesale change. But for us it could be an important way for the independent ''movement'' to continue. It works best in conjunction with theatrical, not instead of it, so we welcome it. It's certainly not right for all independent films; it should be one method among many as we all adapt and change.
 WHAT ABOUT THE FILMMAKERS?
 ADAM YAUCH, OSCILLOSCOPE LABORATORIES: I think that the system that has been in place basically involves everyone trying to get their piece upfront, everyone trying to carve out their fees ... actors, producers, directors, writers, everyone trying to get their nut in the budget of the film, which means not only that the cost of making the film is very high, but also that the film makers have no real vested interest in whether people actually go to see the film.
 I think what makes more sense are back-end deals. That would make it cheaper to make the films, and the filmmakers would have a vested interest in whether the film is successful. It puts the film makers on the same team with the financiers and the distributor.
 MR. SEHRING: I also think there is a segment of this new generation of filmmakers and filmgoers that relate to these new platforms and digital technology in a completely different manner than an older generation of filmgoers. I truly believe that if John Cassavetes, the godfather of the American independent film movement, were a young man alive today he would embrace these new technologies, shooting digitally and finding his audience by any means and on any platform possible.

HEADLINE: Clean Water Laws Neglected, at a Cost

BYLINE: By CHARLES DUHIGG; Karl Russell contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Jennifer Hall-Massey knows not to drink the tap water in her home near Charleston, W.Va. 
 In fact, her entire family tries to avoid any contact with the water. Her youngest son has scabs on his arms, legs and chest where the bathwater -- polluted with lead, nickel and other heavy metals -- caused painful rashes. Many of his brother's teeth were capped to replace enamel that was eaten away. 
 Neighbors apply special lotions after showering because their skin burns. Tests show that their tap water contains arsenic, barium, lead, manganese and other chemicals at concentrations federal regulators say could contribute to cancer and damage the kidneys and nervous system.
 ''How can we get digital cable and Internet in our homes, but not clean water?'' said Mrs. Hall-Massey, a senior accountant at one of the state's largest banks. 
 She and her husband, Charles, do not live in some remote corner of Appalachia. Charleston, the state capital, is less than 17 miles from her home. 
 ''How is this still happening today?'' she asked.
 When Mrs. Hall-Massey and 264 neighbors sued nine nearby coal companies, accusing them of putting dangerous waste into local water supplies, their lawyer did not have to look far for evidence. As required by state law, some of the companies had disclosed in reports to regulators that they were pumping into the ground illegal concentrations of chemicals -- the same pollutants that flowed from residents' taps.
 But state regulators never fined or punished those companies for breaking those pollution laws. 
 This pattern is not limited to West Virginia. Almost four decades ago, Congress passed the Clean Water Act to force polluters to disclose the toxins they dump into waterways and to give regulators the power to fine or jail offenders. States have passed pollution statutes of their own. But in recent years, violations of the Clean Water Act have risen steadily across the nation, an extensive review of water pollution records by The New York Times found. 
 In the last five years alone, chemical factories, manufacturing plants and other workplaces have violated water pollution laws more than half a million times. The violations range from failing to report emissions to dumping toxins at concentrations regulators say might contribute to cancer, birth defects and other illnesses. 
 However, the vast majority of those polluters have escaped punishment. State officials have repeatedly ignored obvious illegal dumping, and the Environmental Protection Agency, which can prosecute polluters when states fail to act, has often declined to intervene.
 Because it is difficult to determine what causes diseases like cancer, it is impossible to know how many illnesses are the result of water pollution, or contaminants' role in the health problems of specific individuals. 
 But concerns over these toxins are great enough that Congress and the E.P.A. regulate more than 100 pollutants through the Clean Water Act and strictly limit 91 chemicals or contaminants in tap water through the Safe Drinking Water Act.
 Regulators themselves acknowledge lapses. The new E.P.A. administrator, Lisa P. Jackson, said in an interview that despite many successes since the Clean Water Act was passed in 1972, today the nation's water does not meet public health goals, and enforcement of water pollution laws is unacceptably low. She added that strengthening water protections is among her top priorities. State regulators say they are doing their best with insufficient resources.
 The Times obtained hundreds of thousands of water pollution records through Freedom of Information Act requests to every state and the E.P.A., and compiled a national database of water pollution violations that is more comprehensive than those maintained by states or the E.P.A. (For an interactive version, which can show violations in any community, visit www.nytimes.com/toxicwaters.) 
 In addition, The Times interviewed more than 250 state and federal regulators, water-system managers, environmental advocates and scientists. 
 That research shows that an estimated one in 10 Americans have been exposed to drinking water that contains dangerous chemicals or fails to meet a federal health benchmark in other ways. 
 Those exposures include carcinogens in the tap water of major American cities and unsafe chemicals in drinking-water wells. Wells, which are not typically regulated by the Safe Drinking Water Act, are more likely to contain contaminants than municipal water systems.
 Because most of today's water pollution has no scent or taste, many people who consume dangerous chemicals do not realize it, even after they become sick, researchers say.
 But an estimated 19.5 million Americans fall ill each year from drinking water contaminated with parasites, bacteria or viruses, according to a study published last year in the scientific journal Reviews of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology. That figure does not include illnesses caused by other chemicals and toxins.
 In the nation's largest dairy states, like Wisconsin and California, farmers have sprayed liquefied animal feces onto fields, where it has seeped into wells, causing severe infections. Tap water in parts of the Farm Belt, including cities in Illinois, Kansas, Missouri and Indiana, has contained pesticides at concentrations that some scientists have linked to birth defects and fertility problems. 
 In parts of New York, Rhode Island, Ohio, California and other states where sewer systems cannot accommodate heavy rains, untreated human waste has flowed into rivers and washed onto beaches. Drinking water in parts of New Jersey, New York, Arizona and Massachusetts shows some of the highest concentrations of tetrachloroethylene, a dry cleaning solvent that has been linked to kidney damage and cancer. (Specific types of water pollution across the United States will be examined in future Times articles.)
 The Times's research also shows that last year, 40 percent of the nation's community water systems violated the Safe Drinking Water Act at least once, according to an analysis of E.P.A. data. Those violations ranged from failing to maintain proper paperwork to allowing carcinogens into tap water. More than 23 million people received drinking water from municipal systems that violated a health-based standard. 
 In some cases, people got sick right away. In other situations, pollutants like chemicals, inorganic toxins and heavy metals can accumulate in the body for years or decades before they cause problems. Some of the most frequently detected contaminants have been linked to cancer, birth defects and neurological disorders. 
 Records analyzed by The Times indicate that the Clean Water Act has been violated more than 506,000 times since 2004, by more than 23,000 companies and other facilities, according to reports submitted by polluters themselves. Companies sometimes test what they are dumping only once a quarter, so the actual number of days when they broke the law is often far higher. And some companies illegally avoid reporting their emissions, say officials, so infractions go unrecorded.
 Environmental groups say the number of Clean Water Act violations has increased significantly in the last decade. Comprehensive data go back only five years but show that the number of facilities violating the Clean Water Act grew more than 16 percent from 2004 to 2007, the most recent year with complete data.
 Polluters include small companies, like gas stations, dry cleaners, shopping malls and the Friendly Acres Mobile Home Park in Laporte, Ind., which acknowledged to regulators that it had dumped human waste into a nearby river for three years. 
 They also include large operations, like chemical factories, power plants, sewage treatment centers and one of the biggest zinc smelters, the Horsehead Corporation of Pennsylvania, which has dumped illegal concentrations of copper, lead, zinc, chlorine and selenium into the Ohio River. Those chemicals can contribute to mental retardation and cancer.
 Some violations are relatively minor. But about 60 percent of the polluters were deemed in ''significant noncompliance'' -- meaning their violations were the most serious kind, like dumping cancer-causing chemicals or failing to measure or report when they pollute.
 Finally, the Times's research shows that fewer than 3 percent of Clean Water Act violations resulted in fines or other significant punishments by state officials. And the E.P.A. has often declined to prosecute polluters or force states to strengthen their enforcement by threatening to withhold federal money or take away powers the agency has delegated to state officials.
 Neither Friendly Acres Mobile Home Park nor Horsehead, for instance, was fined for Clean Water Act violations in the last eight years. A representative of Friendly Acres declined to comment. Indiana officials say they are investigating the mobile home park. A representative of Horsehead said the company had taken steps to control pollution and was negotiating with regulators to clean up its emissions. 
 Numerous state and federal lawmakers said they were unaware that pollution was so widespread. 
 ''I don't think anyone realized how bad things have become,'' said Representative James L. Oberstar, a Minnesota Democrat, when told of The Times's findings. Mr. Oberstar is chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, which has jurisdiction over many water-quality issues. 
 ''The E.P.A. and states have completely dropped the ball,'' he said. ''Without oversight and enforcement, companies will use our lakes and rivers as dumping grounds -- and that's exactly what is apparently going on.''
 The E.P.A. administrator, Ms. Jackson, whose appointment was confirmed in January, said in an interview that she intended to strengthen enforcement of the Clean Water Act and pressure states to apply the law. 
 ''I've been saying since Day One I want to work on these water issues pretty broadly across the country,'' she said. On Friday, the E.P.A. said that it was reviewing dozens of coal-mining permits in West Virginia and three other states to make sure they would not violate the Clean Water Act.
 After E.P.A. officials received detailed questions from The New York Times in June, Ms. Jackson sent a memo to her enforcement deputy noting that the E.P.A. is ''falling short of this administration's expectations for the effectiveness of our clean water enforcement programs. Data available to E.P.A. shows that, in many parts of the country, the level of significant noncompliance with permitting requirements is unacceptably high and the level of enforcement activity is unacceptably low.'' 
 State officials, for their part, attribute rising pollution rates to increased workloads and dwindling resources. In 46 states, local regulators have primary responsibility for crucial aspects of the Clean Water Act. Though the number of regulated facilities has more than doubled in the last 10 years, many state enforcement budgets have remained essentially flat when adjusted for inflation. In New York, for example, the number of regulated polluters has almost doubled to 19,000 in the last decade, but the number of inspections each year has remained about the same. 
 But stretched resources are only part of the reason polluters escape punishment. The Times's investigation shows that in West Virginia and other states, powerful industries have often successfully lobbied to undermine effective regulation. 
 State officials also argue that water pollution statistics include minor infractions, like failing to file reports, which do not pose risks to human health, and that records collected by The Times failed to examine informal enforcement methods, like sending warning letters. 
 ''We work enormously hard inspecting our coal mines, analyzing water samples, notifying companies of violations when we detect them,'' said Randy Huffman, head of West Virginia's Department of Environmental Protection. ''When I look at how far we've come in protecting the state's waters since we took responsibility for the Clean Water Act, I think we have a lot to be proud of.''
 But unchecked pollution remains a problem in many states. West Virginia offers a revealing example of why so many companies escape punishment. 
 One Community's Plight
 The mountains surrounding the home of Mrs. Hall-Massey's family and West Virginia's nearby capital have long been mined for coal. And for years, the area enjoyed clean well water. 
 But starting about a decade ago, awful smells began coming from local taps. The water was sometimes gray, cloudy and oily. Bathtubs and washers developed rust-colored rings that scrubbing could not remove. When Mrs. Hall-Massey's husband installed industrial water filters, they quickly turned black. Tests showed that their water contained toxic amounts of lead, manganese, barium and other metals that can contribute to organ failure or developmental problems. 
 Around that time, nearby coal companies had begun pumping industrial waste into the ground. 
 Mining companies often wash their coal to remove impurities. The leftover liquid -- a black fluid containing dissolved minerals and chemicals, known as sludge or slurry -- is often disposed of in vast lagoons or through injection into abandoned mines. The liquid in those lagoons and shafts can flow through cracks in the earth into water supplies. Companies must regularly send samples of the injected liquid to labs, which provide reports that are forwarded to state regulators. 
 In the eight miles surrounding Mrs. Hall-Massey's home, coal companies have injected more than 1.9 billion gallons of coal slurry and sludge into the ground since 2004, according to a review of thousands of state records. Millions more gallons have been dumped into lagoons.
 These underground injections have contained chemicals at concentrations that pose serious health risks, and thousands of injections have violated state regulations and the Safe Drinking Water Act, according to reports sent to the state by companies themselves. 
 For instance, three coal companies -- Loadout, Remington Coal and Pine Ridge, a subsidiary of Peabody Energy, one of the largest coal companies in the world -- reported to state officials that 93 percent of the waste they injected near this community had illegal concentrations of chemicals including arsenic, lead, chromium, beryllium or nickel. 
 Sometimes those concentrations exceeded legal limits by as much as 1,000 percent. Those chemicals have been shown to contribute to cancer, organ failures and other diseases. 
 But those companies were never fined or punished for those illegal injections, according to state records. They were never even warned that their activities had been noticed. 
 Remington Coal declined to comment. A representative of Loadout's parent said the company had assigned its permit to another company, which ceased injecting in 2006. Peabody Energy, which spun off Pine Ridge in 2007, said that some data sent to regulators was inaccurate and that the company's actions reflected best industry practices.
 West Virginia officials, when asked about these violations, said regulators had accidentally overlooked many pollution records the companies submitted until after the statute of limitations had passed, so no action was taken. They also said their studies indicated that those injections could not have affected drinking water in the area and that other injections also had no detectable effect. 
 State officials noted that they had cited more than 4,200 water pollution violations at mine sites around the state since 2000, as well as conducted thousands of investigations. The state has initiated research about how mining affects water quality. After receiving questions from The Times, officials announced a statewide moratorium on issuing injection permits and told some companies that regulators were investigating their injections.
 ''Many of the issues you are examining are several years old, and many have been addressed,'' West Virginia officials wrote in a statement. The state's pollution program ''has had its share of issues,'' regulators wrote. However, ''it is important to note that if the close scrutiny given to our state had been given to others, it is likely that similar issues would have been found.'' 
 More than 350 other companies and facilities in West Virginia have also violated the Clean Water Act in recent years, records show. Those infractions include releasing illegal concentrations of iron, manganese, aluminum and other chemicals into lakes and rivers. 
 As the water in Mrs. Hall-Massey's community continued to worsen, residents began complaining of increased health problems. Gall bladder diseases, fertility problems, miscarriages and kidney and thyroid issues became common, according to interviews. 
 When Mrs. Hall-Massey's family left on vacation, her sons' rashes cleared up. When they returned, the rashes reappeared. Her dentist told her that chemicals appeared to be damaging her teeth and her son's, she said. As the quality of her water worsened, Mrs. Hall-Massey's once-healthy teeth needed many crowns. Her son brushed his teeth often, used a fluoride rinse twice a day and was not allowed to eat sweets. Even so, he continued getting cavities until the family stopped using tap water. By the time his younger brother's teeth started coming in, the family was using bottled water to brush. He has not had dental problems. 
 Medical professionals in the area say residents show unusually high rates of health problems. A survey of more than 100 residents conducted by a nurse hired by Mrs. Hall-Massey's lawyer indicated that as many as 30 percent of people in this area have had their gallbladders removed, and as many as half the residents have significant tooth enamel damage, chronic stomach problems and other illnesses. That research was confirmed through interviews with residents.
 It is difficult to determine which companies, if any, are responsible for the contamination that made its way into tap water or to conclude which specific chemicals, if any, are responsible for particular health problems. Many coal companies say they did not pollute the area's drinking water and chose injection sites that flowed away from nearby homes.
 An independent study by a university researcher challenges some of those claims. 
 ''I don't know what else could be polluting these wells,'' said Ben Stout, a biology professor at Wheeling Jesuit University who tested the water in this community and elsewhere in West Virginia. ''The chemicals coming out of people's taps are identical to the chemicals the coal companies are pumping into the ground.'' 
 One night, Mrs. Hall-Massey's 6-year-old son, Clay, asked to play in the tub. When he got out, his bright red rashes hurt so much he could not fall asleep. Soon, Mrs. Hall-Massey began complaining to state officials. They told her they did not know why her water was bad, she recalls, but doubted coal companies had done anything wrong. The family put their house on the market, but because of the water, buyers were not interested. 
 In December, Mrs. Hall-Massey and neighbors sued in county court, seeking compensation. That suit is pending. To resolve a related lawsuit filed about the same time, the community today gets regular deliveries of clean drinking water, stored in coolers or large blue barrels outside most homes. Construction began in August on a pipeline bringing fresh water to the community. 
 But for now most residents still use polluted water to bathe, shower and wash dishes.
 ''A parent's only real job is to protect our children,'' Mrs. Hall-Massey said. ''But where was the government when we needed them to protect us from this stuff?''
 Regulators 'Overwhelmed'
 Matthew Crum, a 43-year-old lawyer, wanted to protect people like Mrs. Hall-Massey. That is why he joined West Virginia's environmental protection agency in 2001, when it became clear that the state's and nation's streams and rivers were becoming more polluted. 
 But he said he quickly learned that good intentions could not compete with intimidating politicians and a fearful bureaucracy. 
 Mr. Crum grew up during a golden age of environmental activism. He was in elementary school when Congress passed the Clean Water Act of 1972 in response to environmental disasters, including a fire on the polluted Cuyahoga River in Cleveland. The act's goal was to eliminate most water pollution by 1985 and prohibit the ''discharge of toxic pollutants in toxic amounts.'' 
 ''There were a bunch of us that were raised with the example of the Clean Water Act as inspiration,'' he said. ''I wanted to be part of that fight.''
 In the two decades after the act's passage, the nation's waters grew much healthier. The Cuyahoga River, West Virginia's Kanawha River and hundreds of other beaches, streams and ponds were revitalized. 
 But in the late 1990s, some states' enforcement of pollution laws began tapering off, according to regulators and environmentalists. Soon the E.P.A. started reporting that the nation's rivers, lakes and estuaries were becoming dirtier again. Mr. Crum, after a stint in Washington with the Justice Department and the birth of his first child, joined West Virginia's Department of Environmental Protection, where new leadership was committed to revitalizing the Clean Water Act.
 He said his idealism was tested within two weeks, when he was called to a huge coal spill into a stream.
 ''I met our inspector at the spill site, and we had this really awkward conversation,'' Mr. Crum recalled. ''I said we should shut down the mine until everything was cleaned up. The inspector agreed, but he said if he issued that order, he was scared of getting demoted or transferred to the middle of nowhere. Everyone was terrified of doing their job.''
 Mr. Crum temporarily shut the mine. 
 In the next two years, he shut many polluting mines until they changed their ways. His tough approach raised his profile around the state. 
 Mining companies, worried about attracting Mr. Crum's attention, began improving their waste disposal practices, executives from that period said. But they also began complaining to their friends in the state's legislature, they recalled in interviews, and started a whisper campaign accusing Mr. Crum of vendettas against particular companies -- though those same executives now admit they had no evidence for those claims. 
 In 2003, a new director, Stephanie Timmermeyer, was nominated to run the Department of Environmental Protection. One of West Virginia's most powerful state lawmakers, Eustace Frederick, said she would be confirmed, but only if she agreed to fire Mr. Crum, according to several people who said they witnessed the conversation. 
 She was given the job and soon summoned Mr. Crum to her office. He was dismissed two weeks after his second child's birth. 
 Ms. Timmermeyer, who resigned in 2008, did not return calls. Mr. Frederick died last year.
 Since then, hundreds of workplaces in West Virginia have violated pollution laws without paying fines. A half-dozen current and former employees, in interviews, said their enforcement efforts had been undermined by bureaucratic disorganization, a departmental preference to let polluters escape punishment if they promise to try harder, and a revolving door of regulators who leave for higher-paying jobs at the companies they once policed. 
 ''We are outmanned and overwhelmed, and that's exactly how industry wants us,'' said one employee who requested anonymity for fear of being fired. ''It's been obvious for decades that we're not on top of things, and coal companies have earned billions relying on that.''
 In June, four environmental groups petitioned the E.P.A. to take over much of West Virginia's handling of the Clean Water Act, citing a ''nearly complete breakdown'' in the state. The E.P.A. has asked state officials to respond and said it is investigating the petition.
 Similar problems exist in other states, where critics say regulators have often turned a blind eye to polluters. Regulators in five other states, in interviews, said they had been pressured by industry-friendly politicians to drop continuing pollution investigations. 
 ''Unless the E.P.A. is pushing state regulators, a culture of transgression and apathy sets in,'' said William K. Reilly, who led the E.P.A. under President George H. W. Bush. 
 In response, many state officials defend their efforts. A spokeswoman for West Virginia's Department of Environmental Protection, for instance, said that between 2006 and 2008, the number of cease-operation orders issued by regulators was 10 percent higher than during Mr. Crum's two-year tenure. 
 Mr. Huffman, the department's head, said there is no political interference with current investigations. Department officials say they continue to improve the agency's procedures, and note that regulators have assessed $14.7 million in state fines against more than 70 mining companies since 2006. 
 However, that is about equal to the revenue those businesses' parent companies collect every 10 hours, according to financial reports. (To find out about every state's enforcement record and read comments from regulators, visit www.nytimes.com/waterdata.)
 ''The real test is, is our water clean?'' said Mr. Huffman. ''When the Clean Water Act was passed, this river that flows through our capital was very dirty. Thirty years later, it's much cleaner because we've chosen priorities carefully.''
 Some regulators admit that polluters have fallen through the cracks. To genuinely improve enforcement, they say, the E.P.A. needs to lead. 
 ''If you don't have vigorous oversight by the feds, then everything just goes limp,'' said Mr. Crum. ''Regulators can't afford to have some backbone unless they know Washington or the governor's office will back them up.''
 It took Mr. Crum a while to recover from his firing. He moved to Virginia to work at the Nature Conservancy, an environmental conservation group. Today, he is in private practice and works on the occasional environmental lawsuit.
 ''We're moving backwards,'' he said, ''and it's heartbreaking.'' 
 Shortcomings of the E.P.A.
 The memos are marked ''DO NOT DISTRIBUTE.'' 
 They were written this year by E.P.A. staff, the culmination of a five-year investigation of states' enforcement of federal pollution laws. And in bland, bureaucratic terms, they describe a regulatory system -- at the E.P.A. and among state agencies -- that in many ways simply does not work. 
 For years, according to one memo, federal regulators knew that more than 30 states had major problems documenting which companies were violating pollution laws. Another notes that states' ''personnel lack direction, ability or training'' to levy fines large enough to deter polluters. 
 But often, the memos say, the E.P.A. never corrected those problems even though they were widely acknowledged. The E.P.A. ''may hesitate to push the states'' out of ''fear of risking their relationships,'' one report reads. Another notes that E.P.A. offices lack ''a consistent national oversight strategy.'' 
 Some of those memos, part of an effort known as the State Review Framework, were obtained from agency employees who asked for anonymity, and others through Freedom of Information Act requests. 
 Enforcement lapses were particularly bad under the administration of President George W. Bush, employees say. ''For the last eight years, my hands have been tied,'' said one E.P.A. official who requested anonymity for fear of retribution. ''We were told to take our clean water and clean air cases, put them in a box, and lock it shut. Everyone knew polluters were getting away with murder. But these polluters are some of the biggest campaign contributors in town, so no one really cared if they were dumping poisons into streams.''
 The E.P.A. administrators during the last eight years -- Christine Todd Whitman, Michael O. Leavitt and Stephen L. Johnson -- all declined to comment. 
 When President Obama chose Ms. Jackson to head the E.P.A., many environmentalists and agency employees were encouraged. During his campaign, Mr. Obama promised to ''reinvigorate the drinking water standards that have been weakened under the Bush administration and update them to address new threats.'' He pledged to regulate water pollution from livestock operations and push for amendments to the Clean Water Act. 
 But some worry those promises will not be kept. Water issues have taken a back seat to other environmental concerns, like carbon emissions. 
 In an interview, Ms. Jackson noted that many of the nation's waters were healthier today than when the Clean Water Act was passed and said she intended to enforce the law more vigorously. After receiving detailed questions from The Times, she put many of the State Review Framework documents on the agency's Web site, and ordered more disclosure of the agency's handling of water issues, increased enforcement and revamped technology so that facilities' environmental records are more accessible. 
 ''Do critics have a good and valid point when they say improvements need to be made? Absolutely,'' Ms. Jackson said. ''But I think we need to be careful not to do that by scaring the bejesus out of people into thinking that, boy, are things horrible. What it requires is attention, and I'm going to give it that attention.''
 In statements, E.P.A. officials noted that from 2006 to 2008, the agency conducted 11,000 Clean Water Act and 21,000 Safe Drinking Water Act inspections, and referred 146 cases to the Department of Justice. During the 2007 to 2008 period, officials wrote, 92 percent of the population served by community water systems received water that had no reported health-based violations.
 The Times's reporting, the statements added, ''does not distinguish between significant violations and minor violations,'' and ''as a result, the conclusions may present an unduly alarming picture.'' They wrote that ''much of the country's water quality problems are caused by discharges from nonpoint sources of pollution, such as agricultural runoff, which cannot be corrected solely through enforcement.''
 Ultimately, lawmakers and environmental activists say, the best solution is for Congress to hold the E.P.A. and states accountable for their failures. 
 The Clean Water Act, they add, should be expanded to police other types of pollution -- like farm and livestock runoff -- that are largely unregulated. And they say Congress should give state agencies more resources, in the same way that federal dollars helped overhaul the nation's sewage systems in the 1970s.
 Some say changes will not occur without public outrage.
 ''When we started regulating water pollution in the 1970s, there was a huge public outcry because you could see raw sewage flowing into the rivers,'' said William D. Ruckelshaus, who served as the first head of the Environmental Protection Agency under President Richard M. Nixon, and then again under President Ronald Reagan. 
 ''Today the violations are much more subtle -- pesticides and chemicals you can't see or smell that are even more dangerous,'' he added. ''And so a lot of the public pressure on regulatory agencies has ebbed away.''

HEADLINE: Chronicle of a Changing City

BYLINE: By LIZETTE ALVAREZ

 BODY:
POSMAN BOOKS, an independent bookstore, has shrugged off doomsday predictions for the printed word and opened a second shop. A mainstay of Grand Central Terminal for the past decade, Posman's expanded this month into the Chelsea Market, on Ninth Avenue between 15th and 16th Streets. The proprietor is betting that New Yorkers are still keen to buy books from knowledgeable salespeople in a minimalist setting. There is no onslaught of tomes, just a carefully winnowed selection. Logan Fox, the manager, said he is especially fond of the store's handpicked works of fiction. And this being the Chelsea Market, the shop sells a nice variety of cookbooks and other food volumes. ''We don't try to jam everything into what is a limited space,'' Mr. Fox said. ''We try to pick the best of the best in all our sections.'' The shop, which is near the 10th Avenue entrance, has so far benefited from High Line park foot traffic, he said. 
 BULGARI, the Italian luxury goods store most famous for its jewels, closed its Madison Avenue outpost, between 66th and 67th Streets, as well as those in Palm Beach, Fla., and Aspen, Colo., though it expects to open stores in three other cities. Amid the global financial crisis, Bulgari's profits dropped 45 percent last year as even the megawealthy cut back on spending. Sales were down the first half of this year, as well. The 125-year-old brand boomed during the 1990s, when it quickly expanded around the globe and launched lines of perfume, cosmetics and accessories. This year, the company set its sights on cutting costs and expenses. Madison Avenue shoppers will have to head south about 10 blocks to Bulgari's remaining, larger store, at 730 Fifth Avenue, its New York anchor.

HEADLINE: The Home Front Sept. 6-12

 BODY:
THE NEWS The typical American household made less money last year than it made a decade ago, according to new figures from the Census Bureau.
 BEHIND THE NEWS In the four decades that the bureau has been tracking household income, median income has never failed to rise until now. Adjusted for inflation, it slipped to $50,303 last year from $51,295 in 1998. One reason: economic growth in the current decade has been slower than in any decade since before World War II. Income inequality also expanded, to the benefit of a small slice of the wealthy. ''We've seen a lost decade for the typical American family,'' said the economist Lawrence Katz. 
THE NEWS The number of families threatened with losing their homes held steady last month.
 BEHIND THE NEWS A report by RealtyTrac Inc. suggested that efforts by lenders to helped troubled borrowers may be having a gradual impact. Bank repossessions actually dropped 13 percent from July. Still, more than 358,000 foreclosure-related filings were recorded in August, one for every 358 homes in the United States. That was up 18 percent from a year ago, despite a new Federal Reserve survey that suggested the recession is ending. Nevada had the nation's highest foreclosure rate, followed by Florida, California, Arizona and Michigan.
 THE NEWS An exotic mortgage that became popular during the housing boom is now threatening to put a brake on any revival in home prices.
 BEHIND THE NEWS Interest-only loans put off principal payments for 5, 7 or 10 years. But those interest-only periods are now beginning to expire and many of those mortgages will become unaffordable as homeowners start paying principal, which can push up monthly payments by as much as 75 percent. Making matters worse, many of those homes are now worth less than the loans against them. In the next 12 months, $71 billion of those mortgages will reset. And the numbers get bigger in coming years. 
 THE NEWS The partnership that owns the 110 apartment buildings at Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village in Manhattan are facing default after paying $5.4 billion for the complex three years ago.
 BEHIND THE NEWS The 11,227 apartments, more than half of them rent-regulated, have long been an oasis of affordability for middle-class New Yorkers. But the complex has lost more than half its value since Jerry I. and Rob Speyer and BlackRock Realty bought it. Analysts say the partners are at ''high risk'' of default. Tenants would not be likely to face big rent increases or eviction. But they may face deferred maintenance and delayed improvements.
 THE NEWS One high-end property is attracting a lot of attention from potential buyers despite the real estate slump: Bernard L. Madoff's Montauk beach house.
 BEHIND THE NEWS The United States Marshals Service is overseeing the sale of the 3,000-square-foot house on the dunes; proceeds will go into a fund for victims of Mr. Madoff's $65 billion Ponzi scheme. The property went on the market for $8.75 million on Sept. 1 and there were 23 showings over the Labor Day weekend. Other Madoff properties, including a Manhattan penthouse and a house in Palm Beach, Fla., will also be sold. Mr. Madoff has a taken up residence at a penitentiary in Butner, N.C.

HEADLINE: Open the Storeroom: Let's Put on a Show

BYLINE: By JORI FINKEL

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
 WHEN the financial crisis at the Museum of Contemporary Art here made headlines last year, many in the art world questioned why the museum was spending so much on temporary exhibitions while the bulk of its impressive collection languished in storage. It's not just a budget issue but also one of museum identity: if a museum is known for organizing big but short-lived surveys and staging shows on loan from New York, is it giving visitors enough to feel proprietary excitement about and inspire them to keep coming back?
 So there was clearly a silver lining when the museum announced this year that to save money it would cancel several exhibitions and for the first time devote both its buildings -- some 50,000 square feet -- to its permanent collection. This installation will run from Nov. 15 through May 2010, when some galleries will make room for an Arshile Gorky show. Until then, expect to see about 500 works handpicked by the chief curator, Paul Schimmel, which is less than 10 percent of the museum's overall holdings but promises to speak volumes about the history of contemporary art. 
 Last month Mr. Schimmel showed me models in progress of the installation, for which he has largely taken a chronological approach, mixing California artists with New Yorkers and Europeans who worked at the same time. Early on, the New Yorkers clearly outpower their West Coast counterparts. 
 The show begins with a gallery featuring eight of the museum's 11 paintings by Mark Rothko, acquired mainly from the collection of Count Giuseppe Panza. Another early gallery has 8 of the museum's 11 combines by Robert Rauschenberg, also from Panza. 
 But as you enter the 1960s, you see the Los Angeles art scene take root, and you discover one of the reasons it remains so vital today: Many of its most inventive pioneers are still alive and active. Robert Irwin (now in San Diego), John Baldessari (still in Santa Monica) and Ed Ruscha (long in Venice Beach), for example, are well represented in the show, each appearing at multiple junctions. 
 ''I think you will see as the exhibition progresses the growing impact of L.A. artists internationally,'' Mr. Schimmel said. ''What begins as a sprinkling becomes by the end a dominant force.''
 The chronological approach also makes for some startling juxtapositions, like a wall where three pieces -- a biomorphic Ken Price sculpture from 1962; a sketchy, flesh-toned oil by Cy Twombly from 1961 (one of a few works borrowed from Eli Broad to round out the offerings); and a bloody-looking valentine of an abstraction on paper from 1960-63 by Hannah Wilke -- all vibrate with a sexual intensity that Mr. Schimmel described as a ''kind of encoded expressionism.'' (The installation is hardly balanced in terms of gender, but it would probably survive a male-versus-female counting game better than most, thanks not just to the occasional Wilke but to large bodies of photographs by Helen Levitt, Diane Arbus and Nan Goldin.)
 Then comes the generation of Los Angeles artists that Mr. Schimmel helped put on the map with his 1992 exhibition ''Helter Skelter,'' including the shock artists Paul McCarthy, Mike Kelley and Chris Burden. Most of their work appears in the warehouse-style Geffen building, along with a newer crop of Los Angeles art stars, from Laura Owens to Mark Grotjahn to Liz Craft. 
 Throughout, the exhibition has historically important examples of installation art, starting with sculptures from the Store, a mock-retail environment Claes Oldenburg created in Lower Manhattan in 1961, and a mouth-watering re-creation of Mr. Ruscha's 1970 chocolate room. Also look for a lesser known 1969 neon installation by Doug Wheeler that has only been shown five times in the past 25 years. 
 As Mr. Schimmel pointed out, ''People think of installation art as a new thing.'' But they are wrong. This show, as strong on origin stories as the museum's acclaimed surveys of performance art and conceptual art, should dramatically improve our collective memory.

HEADLINE: 36 Hours: Zurich

BYLINE: By ROBERT GOFF

 BODY:
ZURICH is divided into 12 districts, or kreise, but visitors generally don't venture beyond the Altstadt (Old Town), or Kreis 1, where the gears of capitalism move with Swiss precision. That's a shame because Zurich is more than a city of plutocrats and financial courtiers. Kreis 2, which hugs the west side of Lake Zurich, offers entertainment, youth hostels and handsome beaches. The industrial district of Kreis 5 is now filled with big-name contemporary art. And for youthful chaos and culture, take the tram to Kreis 4, where the red-light district has come alive with bohemian design, food and night life. ''It's the difference between Madison Avenue and the Lower East Side,'' said Marc Spiegler, the co-director of Art Basel, who calls Zurich home.
 Friday
 6 p.m. 1)SWISS PERFECTION 
 Like its sleek airport, all gray concrete and polished steel, Zurich can seem blemish-free and a little too perfect. A stroll through Kreis 1, the heart of Zurich, with its gorgeously preserved medieval and 20th-century architecture, won't disabuse you of that notion. Still, it's a sight to behold. For a terrific vantage point, walk south along the western bank of the Limmat River, dipping into the twisting lanes to window shop, and hike up to the Lindenhof (the nearest tram stop is Renneweg), site of a former Roman customs house that sits at the highest point of the Old Town and overlooks the water with views of the Alps.
 8 p.m. 2)BOUGIE BAR
 To rub elbows with the captains of capitalism, sidle up to the Kronenhalle Bar (Ramistrasse 4; 41-44-262-9900; www.kronenhalle.com), inside one of the city's most venerable restaurants. Dark mahogany paneling, green leather walls and marble tables with legs designed by Diego Giacometti exude the Zurich of old money, discretion and fat Swiss bank accounts. Peek inside the restaurant proper, with its high ceilings and renowned art collection, though some of the best works by Chagall, Picasso and Miro have been sold. Resist the temptation to eat there, as good as the Alsatian and Bavarian classics are, and come back when the global economy has improved -- or when someone else is footing the bill.
 9 p.m. 3)CROSSOVER FARE
 Step out of the gilded cocoon of the Altstadt and into Kreis 4, where the Helvetia (Stauffacherquai 1; 41-44-297-99-99; www.hotel-helvetia.ch), a recently renovated restaurant and boutique hotel just over the Sihl River, divides picture-postcard Zurich and the grittier city you'll wish you had more time to explore. In the 1930s, the Helvetia was a meeting place for communists and other agitators. Today, it draws an eclectic mix of hipsters, yuppies and the occasional guy who looks as if he got lost on the way to a leather bar. The kitchen serves modern Swiss cuisine with a seasonal flair (the pot-au-feu with veal was terrific). After dinner, have a nightcap at the dark-wood-paneled bar downstairs or on the terrace overlooking the river. Reservations recommended. Dinner for two, with wine, about 140 francs, or about $130 at 1.08 francs to the dollar.
 Saturday
 11 a.m. 4)ART ESTABLISHMENT
 With so much money sloshing around, it's no surprise that Zurich retains some of the world's fanciest galleries, many in a converted Lowenbrau brewery called the Lowenbrauareal in Kreis 5 at Limmatstrasse 270, just northwest of the city center. Blue-chip galleries include Hauser & Wirth (41-44-446-8050; www.hauserwirth.com) and Bob van Orsouw (41-44-273-1100; www.bobvanorsouw.ch). The complex is also home to the Kunsthalle Zurich (41-44-272-1515; www.kunsthallezurich.ch), a contemporary art museum run by Beatrix Ruf, and the Migros Museum (41-44-277-2050; www.migrosmuseum.ch), known for conceptual art. The building's lobby has an excellent art bookstore stocked with publications on current shows.
 1 p.m. 5)INDUSTRIAL LUNCH
 After a surfeit of art, stay in Kreis 5 and stroll 10 minutes to Restaurant Rosso (Geroldstrasse 31; 41-43-818-22-54; www.restaurant-rosso.ch), which arguably serves Zurich's finest thin-crust pizza. Housed in a former warehouse, the crowded restaurant has an industrial look with concrete floors, glowing pizza ovens and, weather permitting, three terraces. If pizza is not your thing, Rosso also serves delectable pastas like spaghetti with squid and chickpeas, and a salad of fresh figs and Roquefort. The service at Rosso, which will be open on Saturdays starting next month, is harried and indifferent, but the food and lively atmosphere make it worthwhile. Lunch for two is about 60 francs.
 3 p.m. 6)NAUGHTY DESIGNERS
 At night, the narrow streets of Kreis 4, a k a the red-light district, teem with sex workers. But by day, it's the young hustlers of culture who rule the area at fashionable boutiques, cafes and galleries. Design fetishes are satisfied at Bord (Badenerstrasse 123a; 41-43-243-6911; www.bord.ch), a stripped-down former garage in the building's courtyard that sells midcentury modern furniture by stalwarts like Jean Prouve, alongside that of up-and-coming designers. For Swiss urban wear, pop into Street-Files Mini Mart (Badenerstrasse 131; 41-43-322-0323; www.street-files.com), a tiny storefront stuffed with funky T-shirts and items for the skateboarding crowd. Zurich's best young galleries are there, too, including the Claudia Groeflin Galerie (Dienerstrasse 12; 41-43-243-3923; www.claudiagroeflin.com) and Freymond-Guth & Co. (Brauerstrasse 51; 41-44-240-0481; www.freymondguth.com). For an extensive list of design stores, see www.kreislauf4und5.ch.
 9 p.m. 7)CAFE MANIFESTO
 Dada was arguably the most important art movement to originate in Zurich, and it started at the Cafe Voltaire in 1916. Today the city's art cognoscenti have shifted east to Kreis 4, where they gather at the Restaurant Volkshaus (Stauffacherstrasse 60; 41-44-242-1155; www.restaurantvolkshaus.ch). The place looks like a grand restaurant from a half-century ago, gone slightly to seed: vaulted ceilings lighted by a maze of neon tubes, theatrical waiters and meat-heavy dishes like pork cordon bleu with lemon-infused mashed potatoes. Expect better-than-average food and, as the night progresses, a raucous bohemian atmosphere. Dinner for two, about 110 francs.
 11 p.m. 8)STILL COOL
 Unwind, drink and dance with a 20-something pierced crowd at Club Zukunft (Dienerstrasse 33; www.zukunft.cl), an intimate storefront bar with a post-disco interior by the artist David Renggli. Zukunft is a mainstay of the Zurich club scene, and the place to start your late-night adventure into the city's night life. The music tends toward deep house, though a constant rotation of visiting D.J.'s keeps it fresh.
 Sunday
 11 a.m. 9)VEGGIE BUFFET
 Please your doctor with brunch at Hiltl (Sihlstrasse 28; 41-44-227-7000; www.hiltl.ch), a huge vegetarian restaurant with an outdoor patio in the Altstadt. Founded in 1898, it has a spectacularly diverse menu -- everything from Swiss staples like spaetzle to surprisingly authentic Indian curries with tofu and cauliflower. The casual atmosphere balances out the traditional chandelier-and-linen decor. Go for the buffet, which is priced by weight. Lunch can be had for under 20 francs.
 1 p.m. 10)BATHING AND BEAUTY
 In warm-weather months, the Flussbad Oberer Letten (Lennsteg 10; www.badi-info.ch/oberer--letten.html), in the middle of Zurich, is a laid-back, all-welcoming, antiurban riverfront oasis. Bohemians and bankers, athletes and young mothers go there to unwind, swim and play volleyball. A patchwork of wooden terraces and squares of grass encrust the banks, with room to stretch out for a nap or picnic with friends. Cafes and small beer gardens abound, offering a perfect place to return to after exploring the larger city.
 THE BASICS
 Several major airlines offer service between New York and Zurich. American Airlines and Swiss fly from Kennedy Airport; Continental flies out of Newark. A recent Web search found round-trip fares starting at about $650 for flights in late September. 
 Trains run regularly from the Zurich airport to the city center. The trip takes 10 minutes and costs about 6 francs, about $5.50 at 1.08 francs to the dollar. A taxi takes about 20 minutes and costs about 90 francs.
 Hotel Helvetia (Stauffacherquai 1; 41-44-297-9999; www.hotel-helvetia.ch) reopened last December and is popular with a cultured international crowd. The 16 rooms are on the small side yet bright and stylish. There is no room service but the restaurant and bar are excellent. Rooms start at 180 francs. Ask for a room with a view of the Sihl River. 
 Greulich Hotel (Herman-Greulich-Strasse 56; 41-43-243-4243, www.greulich.ch) is a full-service boutique hotel with contemporary design -- clean lines, glass and concrete abound. The 18 rooms surround a quiet, tree-shaded courtyard. Rooms start at 220 francs. 
 Dakini's Bread & Breakfast (Brauerstrasse 87; 41-44-291-4220; www.dakini.ch) is where the cool art kids from London stay, smack in the middle of Zurich's young galleries and surrounded by brothels. It's also a bargain, with double rooms starting at 130 francs.

GREEN METROPOLIS
 Why Living Smaller, Living Closer, and Driving Less Are the Keys to Sustainability
 By David Owen
 357 pp. Riverhead Books. $25.95
 Monty Python used to do a sketch in which the host of a children's television show taught such broad lessons as ''how to play the flute.'' Breezily, the host would suggest blowing through one end of the instrument and wiggling one's fingers over the holes. In ''Green Metropolis,'' David Owen sets out in similar vein to show how people can ''permanently reduce energy use, water consumption, carbon output and many other environmental ills.'' The answer, in short, is to live in densely populated cities. Would that it were so easy. 
 Owen, a staff writer for The New Yorker, makes a convincing case that Manhattan, Hong Kong and large, old European cities are inherently greener than less densely populated places because a higher percentage of their inhabitants walk, bike and use mass transit than drive; they share infrastructure and civic services more efficiently; they live in smaller spaces and use less energy to heat their homes (because those homes tend to share walls); and they're less likely to accumulate a lot of large, energy-sucking appliances. People in cities use about half as much electricity as people who don't, Owen reports, and the average New Yorker generates fewer greenhouse gases annually than ''residents of any other American city, and less than 30 percent of the national average.'' 
 And the carbon footprint of the hybrid-driving country dweller with her triple-paned windows, backyard composter and geothermal heat pump? Fuhgeddaboudit, Owen practically shouts: she's still driving to work, to school, to shops and the post office. He doesn't care if she's powered by French fry grease or the juice of photovoltaic panels: ''Wasted energy is wasted energy no matter how it's generated.'' 
 Even worse than the car itself is the sprawl and the energy-inefficient lifestyle that it enables -- the duplication of infrastructure, larger houses with fertilized, irrigated yards, two-hour commutes. Spreading people thinly across the countryside may seem to decrease environmental impact (it certainly looks and smells better), but in fact it substantially increases that impact ''while also making the problems . . . harder to see and to address.'' 
 ''Green Metropolis'' challenges many cherished assumptions about easy-on-the-earth country living, though many of its revelations may not be revelatory to hardcore carbon counters, or to anyone who read Owen's 2004 New Yorker article from which this book sprouted. Still, it contains some surprises (for example: it takes less energy and infrastructure to move people vertically, in counterweighted elevators, than horizontally). Pugnacious and contrarian, the book has a lot of fun at the expense of sentimental pastoralists, high-minded environmentalists and rich people trying to buy their way into higher green consciousness with expensive ''eco-friendly'' add-ons (photovoltaic panels on their suburban McMansions, say).
 More generally, Owen attacks the anti-urban bias of the American environmental movement, from Thomas Jefferson through John Muir to the modern Sierra Club. He delineates how the movement has encouraged sprawl -- by demonizing cities and exalting open space -- and argues that they need to shift emphasis toward making urban living more ''appealing and life enhancing.'' According to Owen, the most critical environmental issues in dense urban cores aren't carbon footprints but ''old-fashioned quality of life concerns'': crime rates, bad smells, education. The more pleasant the city, the more people will stay in it, rather than fleeing to car-dependent suburbs -- as Owen and his wife did when they left Manhattan for a leafy Connecticut town more than 20 years ago.
 Of course, many environmental groups do work on building livable and affordable cities, even while others embrace a ''buy it to preserve it'' strategy (condemned by Owen as ''Nature Conservancy brain''). Environmental groups, the author writes, should focus on ''intelligently organizing the places where people are,'' instead of where they aren't. I would argue that if no one defends the places people are not, they won't be people-free for long. Not only will we lose the idea of wilderness -- which some consider essential to our human identity -- but we'll lose its invaluable services, like the protection of drinking water and the sequestration of carbon. (In general, concerns about clean water and air get scant shrift here, and New Yorkers are told they needn't fret about conserving electricity, since they already use far less per capita than the national average. This reviewer, who is always looking for something new to unplug, is shocked. And doubtful.)
 Waxing crankier, Owen takes some digs at solar power, net metering (which gives people credit for wind or solar power they deliver back to the grid) and distributed generation: he claims they spur growth and consumption in the 'burbs, though he doesn't give their proponents a chance to rebut his charges, and many of his assertions have a ''just so'' flavor. He briefly disses locavorism as ''arithmetical sleight of hand.'' Yes, fruit trucked from California to Connecticut has a much lower ''fuel per berry'' expenditure than fruit Owen buys after making a special trip to a farm 20 miles away, but he ignores the value of supporting farmers so they don't sell out to developers -- not to mention common-sense route planning. Owen applauds the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) program for raising awareness of environmentally responsible construction but condemns it for encouraging high-priced, high-visibility add-ons (argon-filled windows) instead of non-sexy, lower cost, simpler measures (hand-cranked awnings and better insulation). He correctly notes the perversity of a system that rewards points for ''maximizing open space'' to companies that build on the corners of large lots in auto-dependent exurbs. Erecting a tower near a downtown bus stop would do significantly less environmental harm.
 After laying out what's wrong with the car-dependent lifestyle, Owen offers some nifty but politically challenging prescriptions. For mass transit to work, he writes, cities must not only achieve a threshold of mixed-use density, but driving must become an exceedingly unpleasant alternative. Bring on the double-parked Fed-Ex trucks, the jaywalkers, potholes and scaffolding; reduce road capacity, banish free parking and raise bridge and road tolls. Traffic jams, he writes, ''actually generate environmental benefits, because they urge drivers (and cab riders) either into the subways or onto the sidewalks.''
 And don't get Owen started on high-occupancy-vehicle (H.O.V.) lanes: they mostly just ease traffic! (The author considers anything that makes driving more agreeable, whether hands-free cellphones or recorded books or drive-through Starbucks, an environmental negative.) The real way to make an H.O.V. lane work, he says, is to eliminate regular lanes, increase the number of occupants required to enter the H.O.V. lane, and then charge those single-occupant cars, forced into slow-moving lanes, tolls. Then pray they'll give up and join a carpool.
 Manhattan may be able to teach thecountry about true sustainability, but where will those lessons assume bricks-and-mortar shape? We aren't about to tear down our suburbs and force their inhabitants into dense urban areas. Owen admits that ''how to apply that template remains a frustrating mystery.'' Before giving up entirely, however, he hops in a jet to see if rapidly urbanizing China or India is doing any better (nope). 
 Ultimately, almost all of Owen's potential solutions for treading more lightly on the planet rely on economics (''Environmental solutions that depend solely on will power are doomed to fail,'' he notes). Raise the price of doing bad, while making good more attractive. Tax energy consumption and emissions. Enact policy measures that lead consumers to feel they have no choice but to find or create alternatives to solo automobile use. 
 It sounds good on paper, but there's always going to be a sticking point: human nature. We all yearn for our own personal space, a little fresh air and elbow room. Owen doesn't want to give up his charming but energy-inefficient house in rural Connecticut any more than I would (if I had one). And so he does what anyone with some extra cash and a conscience must: he buys and installs more insulation.

HEADLINE: Land First, Then Peace

BYLINE: By TURKI al-FAISAL. 
Prince Turki al-Faisal, the chairman of the King Faisal Center for Research and Islamic Studies, is a former director of Saudi Arabia's intelligence services and ambassador to the United States.

DATELINE: Jeddah, Saudi Arabia 

 BODY:
 THE United States and other Western powers have for some time been pushing Saudi Arabia to make more gestures toward Israel. More recently, the crown prince of Bahrain urged greater communication with Israel and joint steps from Arab states to revive the peace process. 
 Saudi Arabia is the birthplace of Islam, the custodian of its two holy mosques, the world's energy superpower and the de facto leader of the Arab and Muslim worlds -- that is why our recognition is greatly prized by Israel. However, for all those same reasons, the kingdom holds itself to higher standards of justice and law. It must therefore refuse to engage Israel until it ends its illegal occupation of the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and the Golan Heights as well as Shabaa Farms in Lebanon. For Saudis to take steps toward diplomatic normalization before this land is returned to its rightful owners would undermine international law and turn a blind eye to immorality. 
 Shortly after the Six-Day War in 1967, during which Israel occupied those territories as well as East Jerusalem and the Sinai Peninsula, the United Nations Security Council passed a resolution stating that, in order to form ''a just and lasting peace in the Middle East,'' Israel must withdraw from these newly occupied lands. The Fourth Geneva Convention similarly notes ''the occupying power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies.'' 
 Now, Israeli leaders hint that they are willing to return portions of these occupied territories to Arab control, but only if they are granted military and economic concessions first. For the Arabs to accept such a proposal would only encourage similar outrages in the future by rewarding military conquest. 
 After the Oslo accords of 1993, Arab states took steps to improve their relationships with Israel, allowing for recognition in the form of trade and consular agreements. Israel, however, continued to construct settlements, making its neighbors understandably unwilling to give up more without a demonstration that they would be granted something in return. 
 Today, supporters of Israel cite the outdated 1988 Hamas charter, which called for the destruction of Israel, as evidence of Palestine's attitude toward a two-state solution, without considering the illegalities of Israel's own occupation. Israel has never presented any comprehensive formulation of a peace plan. Saudi Arabia, to the contrary, has done so twice: the Fahd peace plan of 1982 and the Abdullah peace initiative of 2002. Both were endorsed by the Arab world, and both were ignored by Israel.
 In order to achieve peace and a lasting two-state solution, Israel must be willing to give as well as take. A first step should be the immediate removal of all Israeli settlements in the West Bank. Only this would show the world that Israel is serious about peace and not just stalling as it adds more illegal settlers to those already occupying Palestinian land. 
 At the same time, the international community must pressure Israel to relinquish its grip on all Arab territory, not as a means to gain undeserved concessions but instead as an act of good faith and a demonstration that it is willing to play by the Security Council's rules and to abide by global standards of military occupation. The Arab world, in the form of the Arab peace initiative that was endorsed by 22 countries in 2002, has offered Israel peace and normalization in return for Israeli withdrawal from all Arab territories including East Jerusalem -- with the refugee issue to be solved later through mutual consent.
 There have been increasing well-intentioned calls for Saudi Arabia to ''do a Sadat'': King Abdullah travels to Israel and the Israelis reciprocate by making peace with Saudi Arabia. However, those urging such a move must remember that President Anwar el-Sadat of Egypt went to Israel in 1977 to meet with Prime Minister Menachem Begin only after Sadat's envoy, Hassan el-Tohamy, Sadat's envoy, was assured by the Israeli foreign minister, Moshe Dayan, that Israel would withdraw from every last inch of Egyptian territory in return for peace. Absent a similar offer today from Israel to the leaders of Palestine, Lebanon and Syria, there is no reason to look at 1977 as a model. 
 President Obama's speech in Cairo this summer gave the Arab and Muslim worlds heightened expectations. His insistence on a freeze on settlement activity was a welcome development. However, all Israeli governments have expanded settlements, even those that committed not to do so. 
 No country in the region wants more bloodshed. But while Israel's neighbors want peace, they cannot be expected to tolerate what amounts to theft, and certainly should not be pressured into rewarding Israel for the return of land that does not belong to it. Until Israel heeds President Obama's call for the removal of all settlements, the world must be under no illusion that Saudi Arabia will offer what the Israelis most desire -- regional recognition. We are willing to embrace the hands of any partner in peace, but only after they have released their grip on Arab lands.

HEADLINE: A Town That Draws Its Children Back

BYLINE: By DAVE CALDWELL

 BODY:
MATT LOUGHLIN and his wife, Maggie, were raising two sons in Middlesex. But Mr. Loughlin's broadcasting career was on the rise, so they looked to move near the Newark airport, because he traveled for work. They ended up in Westfield.
 Nearly 13 years ago, just before the birth of their third son, Liam, they paid $279,000 for a five-bedroom Dutch colonial. Mr. Loughlin's career has advanced -- he became the radio voice of the New Jersey Devils hockey team three years ago -- but the family remains firmly ensconced in Westfield. 
 ''This sounds so pie in the sky, but it really is small-town America,'' Mr. Loughlin said recently. ''It's too big of a town to say you know everybody, but you see enough people you know.''
 As families like the Loughlins have moved into Westfield, a Union County municipality of about 30,000, it has slowly lost some of its mom-and-pop ambience and morphed into a suburb of restaurants and boutiques. 
 But many of the attributes that drew the Loughlins still hold sway. The town has a coziness that stems from an intergenerational appeal. People who grew up here often choose to move back as adults -- to be near parents and to be parents themselves. It's the kind of community where children ride their bicycles and skateboards downtown, gathering at delis and Italian-ice stands.
 ''It's just a very welcoming place,'' said Brian Granstrand, a lawyer who moved to Westfield 24 years ago with his wife, Suzanne. They have four children, 21 to 16.
 A corollary: Because it is relatively safe and has a well-regarded school district, Westfield has also become more expensive. A recent look at the Garden State Multiple Listing Service (gsmls.com) revealed 133 homes on the market. The median price was $714,000.
 ''When I retire, I think I'm going to have to move, because property taxes are very high,'' Mr. Granstrand said.
 Westfield is likely to undergo still more changes. Today, it lacks direct train service to New York City; commuters must make a connection at Pennsylvania Station in Newark. But according to Andrew Skibitsky, the mayor of Westfield Township, construction is under way on a railroad tunnel that will provide direct service to Midtown Manhattan by 2016. 
 Mr. Skibitsky sees this as a ''major, major benefit for Westfield.'' 
 Even in this economy, the township has not had to trim its municipal services. Staff reductions have been made through attrition, he said. There are only a few empty storefronts downtown.
 As the town has become more popular, traffic flow and parking have become an issue. As Keith Gibbons, a 50-year resident, put it, ''Everybody's going to circle through town three times to look for a parking spot right in front of the place where they want to go.''
 Mr. Gibbons remembers when more blue-collar workers and municipal employees like police officers and firefighters lived in town. But in the late 1990s, he said, smaller homes were demolished so ''McMansions'' could be built.
 ''When you can walk through town and remember who used to own a store and knew those people,'' he said, ''you have a different take.'' 
 But he, too, is planning to stay. Westfield has become much more exclusive than it was when he bought his first home in 1983, for $72,000. ''And I felt at the time, did we overpay?'' Mr. Gibbons said. But like the Loughlins, he is comfortable with his decision.
 WHAT YOU'LL FIND
 Westfield Township is about 25 miles southwest of New York, roughly in the middle of built-up Union County, west of Elizabeth and Newark Liberty International Airport. Springfield, Kenilworth, Cranford and Garwood are to the north and east, and Mountainside, Scotch Plains and Clark to the south and west.
 The Garden State Parkway is accessible from Route 28, or North Avenue, which slices through Westfield, then Garwood and Cranford. Westfield is described as having two parts -- the north side and the somewhat newer south side -- though residents say they don't see a lot of difference.
 Broad Street, a wide and leafy boulevard lined with homes in a mix of styles, runs through the north end of the township, near Echo Lake Country Club and the rolling Fairview Cemetery. Chestnut Street, which leads to the complex of youth baseball fields known as Gumbert Park, is stately, with speed bumps slowing cars through the area.
 ''The sense of community is very powerful,'' said Scott Gleason, an agent for Re/Max Properties Unlimited who has been a resident since 2003. ''There are a terrific number of people who grew up in Westfield in the 1950s and 1960s, move away, but come back because they want to recapture what it was like growing up.''
 The New Jersey Transit railroad station, a prim stone building, sits at the heart of downtown. Mayor Skibitsky says retail space takes up about a million square feet -- about evenly divided between independents and chains.
 WHAT YOU'LL PAY
 According to the listing service, prices range from $180,000 for a 1965 one-bedroom condominium, to $3.199 million for a new 7,000-square-foot French Norman on 1.22 acres. The 2009 tax bill on a house listed at $749,000, a five-bedroom colonial, was $8,549. 
 Mr. Gleason said the local market had not been immune to economic conditions, especially at higher price points. Values have held up better in the middle and lower ranges. 
 Recently, he said, business has picked up. Multiple bids and sales within 72 hours have become more common. According to Mr. Gleason, homes closer to the center of town tended to hold their value better than those for which a car was needed. Making a sale for over $2 million, he said, is ''going to be a long and daunting process. But every well-presented proposition is going.''
 There were 42 sales in July 2009, versus 37 in July 2006, according to listing-service data supplied by Mr. Gleason. But the average price fell by almost 19 percent in those three years, to $655,395 from $807,215. ''If a house is nice and has a good price tag, they're going pretty quick,'' said Constance Hellhake, also with Re/Max Properties.
 THE SCHOOLS
 The system has six elementary schools. Roosevelt and Edison Intermediate Schools are for Grades 6, 7 and 8, and Westfield High School has about 1,800 students enrolled in Grades 9 through 12. SAT averages last year were 591 in math, 559 in reading and 566 in writing, versus 509, 492 and 494 statewide. The class of 2008 had a 98.5 percent graduation rate, versus 93.1 percent statewide. 
 WHAT TO DO
 The downtown is an interesting mix. There are chain stores like the Gap, Staples, Starbucks, Qdoba and Williams-Sonoma, but there is also the Rialto Theater, with Art Deco letters on its marquee, and a row of restaurants on Elm Street, including Sweet Waters Steak House. In the summer, there are jazz performances downtown.
 ''It does lend itself to a pedestrian stroll,'' Mr. Loughlin said.
 Westfield is known throughout New Jersey for its extensive youth and adult recreation program. There are nine municipal parks and fields in the township, plus tennis courts at Elm and Walnut Streets. Tamaques Reservation, at 106 acres, is the largest, with football and baseball fields and places to jog and picnic. Memorial Pool is a popular summer gathering place; an annual family membership for residents is $350.
 The Westfield Symphony Orchestra (westfieldsymphony.org) has six concerts scheduled at several locations for the 2009-10 season. The first, on Sept. 26, will be performed at Summit High School in collaboration with the New York Opera Society.
 THE COMMUTE
 The train station is on the New Jersey Transit Raritan Valley line to Newark Penn Station, where commuters transfer to trains into New York. A monthly pass is $198. Nine trains make the 47- to 62-minute trip to New York on weekdays from 5 to 9 a.m., and seven trains go to Westfield from 4 to 6 p.m.
 The township has waiting lists of two to five years for two permit lots near the station. Permit parking at Lot No. 3, on the south side of the station, is $576 annually and $360 for six months. Permit parking at Lot No. 6, about two blocks from the station, is $360 annually and $180 for six months.
 Additionally, New Jersey Transit operates the No. 113 bus line from a stop at the Westfield train station to the Port Authority in Midtown Manhattan. There are 25 express buses between 5 and 9 a.m. that stop only in Cranford before going to New York. One-way trips take about 55 minutes, and a monthly pass is $184.
 THE HISTORY
 European settlers bought a tract of land from Lenape leaders in 1664. The area was part of Elizabethtown (now Elizabeth) until 1794, but the settlement had become known as ''the West Fields'' by 1720 or so, according to the town's Web site. 
 British soldiers looted a Continental Army command post in the area in the summer of 1777.

HEADLINE: 'An Epidemic Of Capital Destruction'

 BODY:
One of the most terrifying and catastrophic weeks in Wall Street history unfolded a year ago. Lehman Brothers collapsed into bankruptcy. Merrill Lynch agreed to be bought at a fire-sale price. The large insurer American International Group was forced to go hat in hand to the federal government. The stock market plunged. Credit markets seized up. The global economy seemed to be sinking into a second Great Depression. Here's how it looked at the time, in the pages of The Times, listed by date of publication.
 September 12
 When the mortgage crisis first flared, many Lehman executives, and others on Wall Street, believed the crisis would be short-lived. [Richard S.] Fuld, [Lehamn's hard-charging chief executive], was characteristically defiant.''Do we have some stuff on the books that would be tough to get rid of? Yes,'' he said last summer. ''Is it going to kill us? Of course not.'' 
 In the last few days, employees of Lehman Brothers have wrung their hands as the value of their stock evaporated before their eyes. Now, many fear losing their jobs, too. ... ''Everyone is walking around like they have just been Tasered,'' said one Lehman employee... ''Everyone was always hoping we would pull through. Now, that is not really an option. ...''
 September 13
 As Lehman Brothers teetered Friday evening, Federal Reserve officials summoned the heads of major Wall Street firms to a meeting in lower Manhattan and insisted they rescue the stricken investment bank and develop plans to stabilize the financial markets. 
 September 14
 Fearing that Lehman Brothers is only days away from collapse, government officials and senior Wall Street executives met on Saturday to try to arrest a downward spiral that might imperil other financial institutions. ... 
 Adding urgency to the meeting were growing concerns that other big financial institutions like the insurance giant American International Group and the nation's largest brokerage firm, Merrill Lynch, might face a similar crisis ...
 ''You have to think of this like there is an epidemic going on -- an epidemic of capital destruction,'' said James L. Melcher, president of the hedge fund Balestra Capital.
 September 15
 Over the weekend: Dinner parties were canceled. Weekend getaways were postponed. All of Wall Street, it seemed, was on high alert.
 In skyscrapers across Manhattan, banking executives were holed up inside their headquarters, within cocoons of soft rugs and wood-paneled walls, desperately trying to assess their company's exposure to the stricken Lehman. It was, by all accounts, a day unlike anything Wall Street had ever seen. 
 In the financial district, bond traders, anxious about how the markets would react on Monday, sought refuge in ultrasafe Treasury bills. Greenwich, Conn., that leafy realm of hedge fund millionaires and corporate chieftains, felt like a ghost town.
 Then, on Sunday: In one of the most dramatic days in Wall Street's history, Merrill Lynch agreed to sell itself on Sunday to Bank of America for roughly $50 billion to avert a deepening financial crisis, while another prominent securities firm, Lehman Brothers, said it would seek bankruptcy protection and hurtled toward liquidation after it failed to find a buyer. 
 The humbling moves, which reshape the landscape of American finance, mark the latest chapter in a tumultuous year in which once-proud financial institutions have been brought to their knees as a result of hundreds of billions of dollars in losses because of bad mortgage finance and real estate investments. 
 ''This is an earth-shattering event, this is like a tectonic plate shifting event,'' said Thomas Priore, chief executive of Institutional Credit Partners, a hedge fund active in credit markets. ''This is welcome back to Black Monday.''
 About 12:30 Monday morning, Lehman sent out a press release announcing its intention to seek bankruptcy protection. Lehman's 25,000 employees learned of the filing through the media ... 
 Just a couple of hours later, Lehman workers began arriving at the bank's London headquarters in Canary Wharf and were summoned to a companywide meeting. 
 ''It's over,'' said Christian Meissner, the co-head of Lehman's European and Middle Eastern operations, as he explained that bankruptcy administrators were now in charge of the 158-year-old investment bank. ...
 ''People are just packing their things and leaving, and many didn't even come in,'' a Lehman employee said. ''We were basically told to do our expenses and get our personal belongings.'' 
 [In New York] bottles of alcohol popped up on the equity trading floor around noon. A dark, squat bottle of Don Julio tequila shared desk space with a keyboard; two rows over, a glass container of 80-proof Monte Alban Mezcal appeared only half full. Pizza arrived soon afterward, two dozen boxes of square-cut slices that were quickly devoured.
 Merrill, which has lost more than $45 billion on its mortgage investments, agreed to sell itself to Bank of America for $50.3 billion in stock, according to people briefed on the negotiations. 
 ''Merrill was a kind of bedrock institution whose stability and longevity was taken for granted and was reassuring to people,'' said Steve Fraser, a Wall Street historian and author of '''Wall Street: America's Dream Palace.''
 The big insurance company, the American International Group, was seeking a $40 billion bridge loan Sunday night from the Federal Reserve, as it faces a potential downgrade from credit ratings agencies that could spell its doom, a person briefed on the matter said.
 September 16
 In another unnerving day for Wall Street, investors suffered their worst losses since the terrorist attacks of 2001, and government officials raced to prevent the financial crisis from spreading.
 September 18
 The financial crisis entered a potentially dangerous new phase on Wednesday when many credit markets stopped working normally as investors around the world frantically moved their money into the safest investments, like Treasury bills. 
 As a result, the cost of borrowing soared for many companies, while the stocks of Wall Street firms like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley that only a couple of weeks ago were considered relatively strong came under assault by waves of selling ... 
 The assault on these two companies underscored how quickly a sense of fear is spreading through Wall Street... 
 ''Stop the Insanity,'' wrote Glenn Schorr, a brokerage analyst at UBS, in an e-mail message to clients on Wednesday. 
 Some economists worry that a psychology of fear has gripped investors, not only in the United States but also in Europe and Asia...''It's like having a fire in a cinema,'' said Hyun Song Shin, an economics professor at Princeton. ''Everybody is rushing to the door. You are rushing to the door because everyone is rushing to the door. Clearly, as a collective action, it is a disaster.''

HEADLINE: The Recession's Racial Divide

BYLINE: By BARBARA EHRENREICH and DEDRICK MUHAMMAD. 
Barbara Ehrenreich is the author of the forthcoming ''Bright-Sided: How the Relentless Promotion of Positive Thinking Has Undermined America.'' Dedrick Muhammad is a senior organizer and research associate at the Institute for Policy Studies.

 BODY:
WHAT do you get when you combine the worst economic downturn since the Depression with the first black president? A surge of white racial resentment, loosely disguised as a populist revolt. An article on the Fox News Web site has put forth the theory that health reform is a stealth version of reparations for slavery: whites will foot the bill and, by some undisclosed mechanism, blacks will get all the care. President Obama, in such fantasies, is a dictator and, in one image circulated among the anti-tax, anti-health reform ''tea parties,'' he is depicted as a befeathered African witch doctor with little tusks coming out of his nostrils. When you're going down, as the white middle class has been doing for several years now, it's all too easy to imagine that it's because someone else is climbing up over your back. 
 Despite the sense of white grievance, though, blacks are the ones who are taking the brunt of the recession, with disproportionately high levels of foreclosures and unemployment. And they weren't doing so well to begin with. At the start of the recession, 33 percent of the black middle class was already in danger of falling to a lower economic level, according to a study by the Institute on Assets and Social Policy at Brandeis University and Demos, a nonpartisan public policy research organization. 
 In fact, you could say that for African-Americans the recession is over. It occurred from 2000 to 2007, as black employment decreased by 2.4 percent and incomes declined by 2.9 percent. During those seven years, one-third of black children lived in poverty, and black unemployment -- even among college graduates -- consistently ran at about twice the level of white unemployment. 
 That was the black recession. What's happening now is more like a depression. Nauvata and James, a middle-aged African American couple living in Prince Georges County, Md., who asked that their last name not be published, had never recovered from the first recession of the '00s when the second one came along. In 2003 Nauvata was laid off from a $25-an-hour administrative job at Aetna, and in 2007 she wound up in $10.50-an-hour job at a car rental company. James has had a steady union job as a building equipment operator, but the two couldn't earn enough to save themselves from predatory lending schemes. 
 They were paying off a $524 dining set bought on credit from the furniture store Levitz when it went out of business, and their debt swelled inexplicably as it was sold from one creditor to another. The couple ultimately spent a total of $3,800 to both pay it off and hire a lawyer to clear their credit rating. But to do this they had to refinance their home -- not once, but with a series of mortgage lenders. Now they face foreclosure. 
 Nauvata, who is 47, has since seen her blood pressure soar, and James, 56, has developed heart palpitations. ''There is no middle class anymore,'' he told us, ''just a top and a bottom.''
 Plenty of formerly middle- or working-class whites have followed similar paths to ruin: the layoff or reduced hours, the credit traps and ever-rising debts, the lost home. But one thing distinguishes hard-pressed African-Americans as a group: Thanks to a legacy of a discrimination in both hiring and lending, they're less likely than whites to be cushioned against the blows by wealthy relatives or well-stocked savings accounts. In 2008, on the cusp of the recession, the typical African-American family had only a dime for every dollar of wealth possessed by the typical white family. Only 18 percent of blacks and Latinos had retirement accounts, compared with 43.4 percent of whites.
 Racial asymmetry was stamped on this recession from the beginning. Wall Street's reckless infatuation with subprime mortgages led to the global financial crash of 2007, which depleted home values and 401(k)'s across the racial spectrum. People of all races got sucked into subprime and adjustable-rate mortgages, but even high-income blacks were almost twice as likely to end up with subprime home-purchase loans as low-income whites -- even when they qualified for prime mortgages, even when they offered down payments. 
 According to a 2008 report by United for a Fair Economy, a research and advocacy group, from 1998 to 2006 (before the subprime crisis), blacks lost $71 billion to $93 billion in home-value wealth from subprime loans. The researchers called this family net-worth catastrophe the ''greatest loss of wealth in recent history for people of color.'' And the worst was yet to come.
 In a new documentary film about the subprime crisis, ''American Casino,'' solid black citizens -- a high school social studies teacher, a psychotherapist, a minister -- relate how they lost their homes when their monthly mortgage payments exploded. Watching the parts of the film set in Baltimore is a little like watching the TV series ''The Wire,'' except that the bad guys don't live in the projects; they hover over computer screens on Wall Street.
 It's not easy to get people to talk about their subprime experiences. There's the humiliation of having been ''played'' by distant, mysterious forces. ''I don't feel very good about myself,'' says the teacher in ''American Casino.'' ''I kind of feel like a failure.'' 
 Even people who know better tend to blame themselves -- like Melonie Griffith, a 40-year-old African-American who works with the Boston group City Life/La Vida Urbana helping other people avoid foreclosure and eviction. She criticizes herself for having been ''naive'' enough to trust the mortgage lender who, in 2004, told her not to worry about the high monthly payments she was signing on for because the mortgage would be refinanced in ''a couple of months.'' The lender then disappeared, leaving Ms. Griffith in foreclosure, with ''nowhere for my kids and me to go.'' Only when she went public with her story did she find that she wasn't the only one. ''There is a consistent pattern here,'' she told us.
 Mortgage lenders like Countrywide and Wells Fargo sought out minority homebuyers for the heartbreakingly simple reason that, for decades, blacks had been denied mortgages on racial grounds, and were thus a ready-made market for the gonzo mortgage products of the mid-'00s. Banks replaced the old racist practice of redlining with ''reverse redlining'' -- intensive marketing aimed at black neighborhoods in the name of extending home ownership to the historically excluded. Countrywide, which prided itself on being a dream factory for previously disadvantaged homebuyers, rolled out commercials showing canny black women talking their husbands into signing mortgages. 
 At Wells Fargo, Elizabeth Jacobson, a former loan officer at the company, recently revealed -- in an affidavit in a lawsuit by the City of Baltimore -- that salesmen were encouraged to try to persuade black preachers to hold ''wealth-building seminars'' in their churches. For every loan that resulted from these seminars, whether to buy a new home or refinance one, Wells Fargo promised to donate $350 to the customer's favorite charity, usually the church. (Wells Fargo denied any effort to market subprime loans specifically to blacks.) Another former loan officer, Tony Paschal, reported that at the same time cynicism was rampant within Wells Fargo, with some employees referring to subprimes as ''ghetto loans'' and to minority customers as ''mud people.'' 
 If any cultural factor predisposed blacks to fall for risky loans, it was one widely shared with whites -- a penchant for ''positive thinking'' and unwarranted optimism, which takes the theological form of the ''prosperity gospel.'' Since ''God wants to prosper you,'' all you have to do to get something is ''name it and claim it.'' A 2000 DVD from the black evangelist Creflo Dollar featured African-American parishioners shouting, ''I want my stuff -- right now!'' 
 Joel Osteen, the white megachurch pastor who draws 40,000 worshippers each Sunday, about two-thirds of them black and Latino, likes to relate how he himself succumbed to God's urgings -- conveyed by his wife -- to upgrade to a larger house. According to Jonathan Walton, a religion professor at the University of California at Riverside, pastors like Mr. Osteen reassured people about subprime mortgages by getting them to believe that ''God caused the bank to ignore my credit score and bless me with my first house.'' If African-Americans made any collective mistake in the mid-'00s, it was to embrace white culture too enthusiastically, and substitute the individual wish-fulfillment promoted by Norman Vincent Peale for the collective-action message of Martin Luther King.
 But you didn't need a dodgy mortgage to be wiped out by the subprime crisis and ensuing recession. Black unemployment is now at 15.1 percent, compared with 8.9 percent for whites. In New York City, black unemployment has been rising four times as fast as that of whites. By 2010, according to Lawrence Mishel of the Economic Policy Institute, 40 percent of African-Americans nationwide will have endured patches of unemployment or underemployment. 
 One result is that blacks are being hit by a second wave of foreclosures caused by unemployment. Willett Thomas, a neat, wiry 47-year-old in Washington who describes herself as a ''fiscal conservative,'' told us that until a year ago she thought she'd ''figured out a way to live my dream.'' Not only did she have a job and a house, but she had a rental property in Gainesville, Fla., leaving her with the flexibility to pursue a part-time writing career. 
 Then she became ill, lost her job and fell behind on the fixed-rate mortgage on her home. The tenants in Florida had financial problems of their own and stopped paying rent. Now, although she manages to have an interview a week and regularly upgrades her resume, Ms. Thomas cannot find a new job. The house she lives in is in foreclosure.
 Mulugeta Yimer of Alexandria, Va., still has his taxi-driving job, but it no longer pays enough to live on. A thin, tall man with worry written all over his face, Mr. Yimer came to this country in 1981 as a refugee from Ethiopia, firmly believing in the American dream. In 2003, when Wells Fargo offered him an adjustable-rate mortgage, he calculated that he'd be able to deal with the higher interest rate when it kicked in. But the recession delivered a near-mortal blow to the taxi industry, even in the still relatively affluent Washington suburbs. He's now putting in 19-hour days, with occasional naps in his taxi, while his wife works 32 hours a week at a convenience store, but they still don't earn enough to cover expenses: $400 a month for health insurance, $800 for child care and $1,700 for the mortgage. What will Mr. Yimer do if he ends up losing his house? ''We'll go to a shelter, I guess,'' he said, throwing open his hands, ''if we can find one.''
 So despite the right-wing perception of black power grabs, this recession is on track to leave blacks even more economically disadvantaged than they were. Does a black president who is inclined toward bipartisanship dare address this destruction of the black middle class? Probably not. But if Americans of all races don't get some economic relief soon, the pain will only increase and with it, perversely, the unfounded sense of white racial grievance.

HEADLINE: In Wisconsin, Hopeful Signs For Factories

BYLINE: By PETER S. GOODMAN

DATELINE: MEQUON, Wis. 

 BODY:
At the Rockwell Automation factory here, something encouraging happened recently that might be a portent of national economic recovery: managers reinstated a shift, hiring a dozen workers.
 After months of layoffs, diminished production and anxiety about the depths of the Great Recession, the company -- a bellwether because most of its customers are manufacturers themselves -- saw enough new orders to justify adding people. 
 Given the panicked retreat that has characterized life on the American factory floor for many months, any expansion registers as a hopeful sign for the economy. Last week, the Federal Reserve found signs of ''modest improvement'' in manufacturing. That reinforced the direction of a widely watched manufacturing index tracked by the Institute for Supply Management, which surged into positive territory last month for the first time in a year and a half.
 Yet these indications, while welcome, promise no vigorous expansion: For now, factory overseers remain uncertain that a lasting resurgence is at hand, making them reluctant to hire workers aggressively and invest in new equipment. 
 ''We're starting to see stabilization,'' said Keith D. Nosbusch, chairman and chief executive of Rockwell, which makes machinery used in manufacturing. ''The deceleration is slowing, but we haven't seen the bottom yet. We have yet to see a turnaround.''
 The tentative signs of factory improvement largely reflect a replenishing of inventories after months of weak sales, rather than an increase in demand for goods. For manufacturing to return to strength and help power a broader economic recovery, consumers would have to start buying more products, experts say.
 Still, the mere process of expanding inventories could be enough to sustain several months of increased production, say economists. That could eventually generate more factory jobs, giving workers money to spend at other businesses. And that might instill enough momentum for a broader economic expansion.
 ''After one of the most incredible cutbacks and slicing away ever, just replenishing inventories is sufficient to maintain increased output,'' said Allen Sinai, chief global economist at Decision Economics. ''It's part of the process of recovery in the United States, which is imminent.''
 On Wall Street and in academic circles, where economists pick through often contradictory indicators for evidence of revival, the situation inside American factories is of crucial interest. Though manufacturing has diminished as a share of the economy, it still employs 11.7 million people, and it tends to trace the ups and downs of broader business prospects, making it a useful indicator of overall economic vigor.
 The recent manufacturing data has been seized on by many economists as a signal that the recession is, technically speaking, already over or nearing an end. 
 ''Those are genuine signs that this economy has turned the corner and begun to recover,'' said Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist at the Economic Outlook Group.
 However, for now, growth in manufacturing jobs is mostly just a hope. Though improved business prospects appear to have tempered layoffs, manufacturing lost 65,000 net jobs in August, according to the Labor Department, adding to more than 2 million jobs in the sector that have disappeared since the recession began.
 ''None of these factories are yet convinced that this is a sustainable recovery, so they're very cautious about hiring,'' said Mr. Baumohl.
 Wisconsin is an ideal laboratory in which to assess manufacturing. No other state has a larger share of its jobs in manufacturing -- more than 17 percent, according to the Labor Department. Today, that translates into a palpable lack of security.
 At the original Miller brewery in downtown Milwaukee -- now a tiny piece of a mammoth operation that produces more than 100 million cases of beer annually -- roughly 25 of the 550 workers who labor for hourly wages typically leave the company in the course of a year. This year, the number is zero.
 ''It used to be you might leave here and go over there for a higher-paying job,'' said Andrew K. Moschea, a brewing vice president for Miller Coors. '' 'Over there' isn't there anymore, or it's laying off.''
 The Miller plant is a bright spot in the local economy. Though production of kegs of beer is down a little, reflecting business at restaurants and bars, lower-priced cans are up, making for expanded volume.
 When Miller recently hired 30 part-time workers to round out its weekend shifts, paying more than $20 an hour, thousands applied, many from skilled trades that once paid twice as much.
 Rockwell Automation's machinery, computer software and know-how form the guts of assembly lines in a wide array of industries.
 ''The products they produce through the whole range are critical for doing manufacturing,'' said John S. Heywood, an economist at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee.
 In recent months, Rockwell has suffered along with much of American industry. As car sales plummeted, automakers canceled new orders for Rockwell's machinery. As the price of oil plunged this year, energy companies scrapped expansion plans, eliminating demand for Rockwell's machinery.
 In recent years, Rockwell has established a presence in more than 80 countries, deriving roughly half its revenue overseas. But as the slowdown spread to Asia, Europe and Latin America, the comforts of being global evaporated. 
 As Rockwell's customers grew fearful of losing access to credit, they eliminated plans for new factories, idled existing plants and put off replacing and servicing older gear. ''It came quick,'' Mr. Nosbusch said. ''It was steep.'' 
 Rockwell began large-scale layoffs in October 2008 -- three percent of its 20,000-plus workers worldwide, including 300 in the United States. Scattered layoffs continued in the months after. The company also cut working hours, trimmed wages and eliminated its own contributions to employee retirement accounts.
 Here in Mequon, about 20 miles north of Milwaukee, management trimmed its production work force from about 240 to 220. It scrapped a shift in its board shop, where workers in lab coats use sophisticated machinery to attach capacitors, transistors and other electronics to custom-sized circuit boards.
 The circuit boards are the brains of Rockwell's power-regulating machines. Production declined by one-fifth this year. But in recent weeks, as Rockwell has rebuilt its inventory, production has nudged up 5 percent, prompting the resurrection of the third shift.
 Still, worry remains, making future hiring unlikely. Rockwell's customers have resumed replacing older gear, but have not begun full-scale expansions, which would generate much more business.
 Factory managers doubt whether American consumers -- still reeling from lost jobs and savings -- can snap back vigorously enough to restore manufacturing.
 ''I've got 22 years of experience and I've never seen anything like this,'' said Mike Laszkiewicz, 48, vice president and general manager of Rockwell's power control business. ''This is a tough one. I'm a little uncertain which way this is going to go.''

HEADLINE: Is Happiness Catching?

BYLINE: By CLIVE THOMPSON. 
Clive Thompson, a contributing writer for the magazine, writes frequently about technology and science.

 BODY:
EILEEN BELLOLI KEEPS very good track of her friends. Belloli, who is 74, was born in Framingham, Mass., which is where she met her future husband, Joseph, when they were both toddlers. (''I tripped her and made her cry,'' recalls Joseph, a laconic and beanpole-tall 76-year-old.) The Bellolis never left Framingham, a comfortable, middle-class town 25 miles west of Boston -- he became a carpenter and, later, a state industrial-safety official; and after raising four children, she taught biology at a middle school. Many of her friends from grade school never left Framingham, either, so after 60 years, she still sees a half dozen of them every six weeks. 
 I visited the Bellolis at their home in Framingham last month, and when I asked Eileen about her old friends, she jumped up from her rose-colored rocking chair, ran to her cabinet and pulled down a binder filled with class photos and pictures from her school reunions. Every five years, she told me, she helps organize a reunion, and each time they manage to collect a group of about 30 students she has known since elementary and junior high school. She opened the binder and flipped through the pictures, each one carefully laminated, with a label on the back listing each classmate's name. ''I'm a Type A personality,'' she said. 
 As I leafed through the binder, I could see that the Bellolis and their friends stayed in very good health over the years. As they aged, they mostly remained trim, even as many other Framingham residents succumbed to obesity. The fattening of America annoys Eileen -- ''people are becoming more and more accustomed to not taking responsibility for their actions,'' she said -- and she particularly prides herself on remaining active. Almost every day she does a three-mile circuit inside the local mall with her husband and a cluster of friends, though she speed walks so rapidly that some gripe about her breakneck pace. Her one vice used to be smoking, usually right after her teaching day ended. ''I would take myself to Friendly's with a book, and I would sit there and have two cups of coffee and two cigarettes,'' she said. At the time, her cigarette habit didn't seem like a problem; most of her friends also smoked socially. But in the late 1980s, a few of them began to quit, and pretty soon Eileen felt awkward holding a cigarette off to one side when out at a restaurant. She quit, too, and within a few years nobody she knew smoked anymore. 
 In the reunion photos, there is only one person who visibly degrades in health as the years pass: a boyish-faced man sporting mutton-chop sideburns. When he was younger, he looked as healthy as the rest of the crowd. But each time he showed up for the reunion, he had grown steadily heavier, until the 2003 photograph, when he looked straightforwardly obese, the only one of his size in the entire picture. Almost uniquely among the crowd, he did not remain friends with his old classmates. His only point of contact was the reunions, which he kept attending until he didn't show up last year. It turned out he'd died.
 The man's story struck me as particularly relevant because Eileen and Joseph are part of a scientific study that might actually help explain his fate. The Bellolis are participants in the Framingham Heart Study, the nation's most ambitious project to understand the roots of heart disease. Founded in 1948 by the National Heart Institute, the study has followed more than 15,000 Framingham residents and their descendants, bringing them in to a doctor's office every four years, on average, for a comprehensive physical. Each time the Bellolis are examined, every aspect of their health is quantified and collected: heart rate, weight, blood levels and more. Over the decades, the Framingham study has yielded a gold mine of information about risk factors for heart disease; it was instrumental, for instance, in identifying the positive role of ''good'' cholesterol. 
 But two years ago, a pair of social scientists named Nicholas Christakis and James Fowler used the information collected over the years about Joseph and Eileen and several thousand of their neighbors to make an entirely different kind of discovery. By analyzing the Framingham data, Christakis and Fowler say, they have for the first time found some solid basis for a potentially powerful theory in epidemiology: that good behaviors -- like quitting smoking or staying slender or being happy -- pass from friend to friend almost as if they were contagious viruses. The Framingham participants, the data suggested, influenced one another's health just by socializing. And the same was true of bad behaviors -- clusters of friends appeared to ''infect'' each other with obesity, unhappiness and smoking. Staying healthy isn't just a matter of your genes and your diet, it seems. Good health is also a product, in part, of your sheer proximity to other healthy people. By keeping in close, regular contact with other healthy friends for decades, Eileen and Joseph had quite possibly kept themselves alive and thriving. And by doing precisely the opposite, the lone obese man hadn't. 
 FOR DECADES, SOCIOLOGISTS and philosophers have suspected that behaviors can be ''contagious.'' In the 1930s, the Austrian sociologist Jacob Moreno began to draw sociograms, little maps of who knew whom in friendship or workplace circles, and he discovered that the shape of social connection varied widely from person to person. Some were sociometric ''stars,'' picked by many others as a friend, while others were ''isolates,'' virtually friendless. In the 1940s and 1950s, social scientists began to analyze how the shape of a social network could affect people's behavior; others examined the way information, gossip and opinion flowed through that network. One pioneer was Paul Lazarsfeld, a sociologist at Columbia University, who analyzed how a commercial product became popular; he argued it was a two-step process, in which highly connected people first absorbed the mass-media ads for a product and then mentioned the product to their many friends. (This concept later bloomed in the 1990s and in this decade with the rage for ''buzz marketing'' -- the attempt to identify thought-leaders who would spread the word about a new product virally.) Lazarsfeld also studied how political opinions flowed through friendship circles; he would ask a group of friends to identify the most influential members of their group, then map out how a political view or support for a candidate spread through and around those individuals. 
 By the 1980s and 1990s, alarmed by the dangers of smoking among young Americans, health care workers began to do the same work on groupings of teenagers to discover exactly how each individual was influenced to pick up the habit. The language of contagion is part of pop culture today, thanks in part to the influence of Malcolm Gladwell's best-selling book ''The Tipping Point.'' It's now common to speak of social changes as epidemics (like the ''obesity epidemic'') and to talk about ''superconnectors'' who are so promiscuously well linked that they exert an outsize influence in society, ushering trends into existence almost single-handedly. 
 Yet the truth is, scientists have never successfully demonstrated that this is really how the world works. None of the case studies directly observed the contagion process in action. They were reverse-engineered later, with sociologists or marketers conducting interviews to try to reconstruct who told whom about what -- which meant that people were potentially misrecalling how they were influenced or whom they influenced. And these studies focused on small groups of people, a few dozen or a few hundred at most, which meant they didn't necessarily indicate much about how a contagious notion spread -- if indeed it did -- among the broad public. Were superconnectors truly important? How many times did someone need to be exposed to a trend or behavior before they ''caught'' it? Certainly, scientists knew that a person could influence an immediate peer -- but could that influence spread further? Despite our pop-cultural faith in social contagion, no one really knew how it worked. 
 Sociologists began hunting for ongoing, real-life situations in which better data could be found. A 2000 study of dorm mates at Dartmouth College by the economist Bruce Sacerdote found that they appeared to infect each other with good and bad study habits -- such that a roommate with a high grade-point average would drag upward the G.P.A. of his lower-scoring roommate, and vice versa. A 2006 Princeton study found that having babies appeared to be contagious: if your sibling has a child, you're 15 percent more likely to have one yourself in the next two years. These were tantalizing findings, but again, each was too narrow to really indicate whether and how the effect worked in the mass public. What was needed was something more ambitious, some way of mapping out the links between thousands of real-life people for years -- decades, even -- to see whether, and how, behaviors spread. 
 NICHOLAS CHRISTAKIS BEGAN taking a new look at this question in 2000 after an experience visiting terminally ill patients in the working-class neighborhoods of Chicago. Christakis is a medical doctor and sociologist at Harvard; back then, he was posted at the University of Chicago and, at the age of 38, he had made a name for himself studying the ''widowhood effect,'' the well-known propensity of spouses to die soon after their partners' deaths. One of his patients was a terminally ill elderly woman with dementia who lived with her daughter as her main caregiver. The daughter was exhausted from caring for her mother for months; the daughter's husband, in turn, was becoming ill from coping with his wife's extreme stress. One night after visiting the dying mother, Christakis arrived back at his office and got a phone call from a friend of the husband, asking for help, explaining that he, too, was feeling overwhelmed by the situation. The mother's sickness had, in effect, spread outward ''across three degrees of separation,'' Christakis told me. ''This illness affects the daughter, who spreads to the husband, who spreads to the friend, the guy who calls me up,'' he added. He began talking to colleagues, wondering how he could further study the phenomenon. 
 In 2002, a common friend introduced him to James Fowler, at the time a Harvard political-science graduate student. Fowler was researching the question of whether the decision to vote in elections could spread virally from one person to another. Christakis and Fowler agreed that social contagion was an important area of inquiry and decided the only way to settle the many unanswered questions surrounding it was to find or compile a huge data set, one that tracked thousands of people. At first, they figured they would mount their own survey. They asked for $25 million from the National Institutes of Health to track 31,000 adults for six years, but the N.I.H. said they had to find some preliminary evidence first. So they went on the hunt for an existing collection of data. They weren't optimistic. While several large surveys of adult health exist, medical researchers have no tradition of thinking about social networks, so they rarely bother to collect data on who knows whom -- which means there's no way to track whether behaviors are spreading from person to person. Christakis and Fowler examined study after study, discarding each one. 
 Christakis knew about the Framingham Heart Study and arranged a visit to the town to learn more. The study seemed promising: he knew it had been underway for more than 50 years and had followed more than 15,000 people, spanning three generations, so in theory, at least, it could offer a crucial moving picture. But how to track social connections? During his visit, Christakis asked one of the coordinators of the study how she and her colleagues were able to stay in contact with so many people for so long. What happened if a family moved away? The woman reached under her desk and pulled out a green sheet. It was a form that staff members used to collect information from every participant each time they came in to be examined -- and it asked them to list all their family and at least one of their friends. ''They asked you, 'Who is your spouse, who are your children, who are your parents, who are your siblings, where do they live, who is your doctor, where do you work, where do you live, who is a close friend who would know where to find you in four years if we can't find you?'' Christakis said. ''And they were writing all this stuff down.'' He felt a jolt of excitement: he and Fowler could use these thousands of green forms to manually reconstruct the social ties of Framingham -- who knew whom, going back decades. 
 Over the next few years, Christakis and Fowler managed a team that painstakingly sifted through the records. When they were done, they had a map of how 5,124 subjects were connected, tracing a web of 53,228 ties between friends and family and work colleagues. Next they analyzed the data, beginning with tracking patterns of how and when Framingham residents became obese. Soon they had created an animated diagram of the entire social network, with each resident represented on their computer screens as a dot that grew bigger or smaller as he or she gained or lost weight over 32 years, from 1971 to 2003. When they ran the animation, they could see that obesity broke out in clusters. People weren't just getting fatter randomly. Groups of people would become obese together, while other groupings would remain slender or even lose weight. 
 And the social effect appeared to be quite powerful. When a Framingham resident became obese, his or her friends were 57 percent more likely to become obese, too. Even more astonishing to Christakis and Fowler was the fact that the effect didn't stop there. In fact, it appeared to skip links. A Framingham resident was roughly 20 percent more likely to become obese if the friend of a friend became obese -- even if the connecting friend didn't put on a single pound. Indeed, a person's risk of obesity went up about 10 percent even if a friend of a friend of a friend gained weight. 
 ''People are connected, and so their health is connected,'' Christakis and Fowler concluded when they summarized their findings in a July 2007 article in The New England Journal of Medicine, the first time the prestigious journal published a study of how social networks affect health. Or as Christakis and Fowler put it in ''Connected,'' their coming book on their findings: ''You may not know him personally, but your friend's husband's co-worker can make you fat. And your sister's friend's boyfriend can make you thin.'' 
 Obesity was only the beginning. Over the next year, the sociologist and the political scientist continued to analyze the Framingham data, finding more and more examples of contagious behavior. Smoking, they discovered, also appeared to spread socially -- in fact, a friend taking up smoking increased your chance of lighting up by 36 percent, and if you had a three-degrees-removed friend who started smoking, you were 11 percent more likely to do the same. Drinking spread socially, as did happiness and even loneliness. And in each case one's individual influence stretched out three degrees before it faded out. They termed this the ''three degrees of influence'' rule about human behavior: We are tied not just to those around us, but to others in a web that stretches farther than we know. 
 WHEN I FIRST MET Christakis and Fowler last spring, at a downtown Manhattan cafe, they seemed like a living example of their theory: even their conversational style appeared to be contagious, each of them bursting in in the middle of a sentence to complete the other's thought. Christakis, an intense and jovial man with bristling eyebrows and a booming voice, wore a suit with no tie and sipped a coffee. Fowler, who is 39, looked like a boyish wunderkind, wearing a T-shirt and jeans and a constant broad smile. In the two years since they published their first work, they had become relatively famous and highly controversial. People -- and late-night comics -- were drawn to a theory that seemed to offer a scientific basis for some exquisitely calculating behavior, like avoiding your friends if they get fat. (Or avoiding your friends merely because some of their friends' friends gained a couple of pounds.) Newspapers splashed Christakis and Fowler's obesity findings across front pages, and the study penetrated into corners of the popular culture generally untouched by social-science research. ''My favorite was the 'Cathy' cartoon,'' Fowler told me; in it, Cathy and two friends sit in a restaurant, chatting about the obesity paper; when the waiter comes, each woman points to another and says, ''She'll have a small dry salad and a cup of water.'' 
 Fowler told me their work had inspired him to lose five pounds and to listen to upbeat music before he arrives home from work so he will be in a good mood when he greets his family. ''I try to get myself in a mental space where I'll be happy,'' he says. ''Because I know that I'm not just having an impact on my son, I'm potentially having an impact on my son's best friend's mother.'' 
 But how, exactly, could obesity or happiness spread through so many links? Between one immediate peer and another, some contagious behaviors -- like smoking -- seem pretty commonsensical. If lots of people around you are smoking, there's going to be peer pressure for you to start, whereas if nobody's smoking, you'll be more likely to stop. But the simple peer-pressure explanation doesn't work as well with happiness or obesity: we don't often urge people around us to eat more or implore them to be happier. (In any case, simply telling someone to be happier or unhappier isn't likely to work.) Instead, Christakis and Fowler hypothesize that these behaviors spread partly through the subconscious social signals that we pick up from those around us, which serve as cues to what is considered normal behavior. Scientists have been documenting this phenomenon; for example, experiments have shown that if a person is seated next to someone who's eating more, he will eat more, too, unwittingly calibrating his sense of what constitutes a normal meal. Christakis and Fowler suspect that as friends around us become heavier, we gradually change our mental picture of what ''obese'' looks like and give ourselves tacit permission to add pounds. With happiness, the two argue that the contagion may be even more deeply subconscious: the spread of good or bad feelings, they say, might be driven partly by ''mirror neurons'' in the brain that automatically mimic what we see in the faces of those around us -- which is why looking at photographs of smiling people can itself often lift your mood. 
 ''In some sense we can begin to understand human emotions like happiness the way we might study the stampeding of buffalo,'' Christakis said. ''You don't ask an individual buffalo, 'Why are you running to the left?' The answer is that the whole herd is running to the left. Similarly, you can see pockets of unhappy and happy people clustered in the network. They don't even know each other necessarily,'' but their moods rise and fall together. 
 The subconscious nature of emotional mirroring might explain one of the more curious findings in their research: If you want to be happy, what's most important is to have lots of friends. Historically, we have often thought that having a small cluster of tight, long-term friends is crucial to being happy. But Christakis and Fowler found that the happiest people in Framingham were those who had the most connections, even if the relationships weren't necessarily deep ones. 
 The reason these people were the happiest, the duo theorize, is that happiness doesn't come only from having deep, heart-to-heart talks. It also comes from having daily exposure to many small moments of contagious happiness. When you frequently see other people smile -- at home, in the street, at your local bar -- your spirits are repeatedly affected by your mirroring of their emotional state. Of course, the danger of being highly connected to lots of people is that you're at risk of encountering many people when they are in bad moods. But Christakis and Fowler say their findings show that the gamble of increased sociability pays off, for a surprising reason: Happiness is more contagious than unhappiness. According to their statistical analysis, each additional happy friend boosts your good cheer by 9 percent, while each additional unhappy friend drags you down by only 7 percent. So by this logic, adding more links to your network should -- mathematically -- add to your store of happiness. ''If you're at the center of a network, you are going to be more susceptible to anything that spreads through it,'' Fowler said. ''And if happiness is spreading more reliably, then on average you're going to be catching happy waves more often than you catch sad waves.'' 
 The Framingham findings also suggest that different contagious behaviors spread in different ways. For example, co-workers did not seem to transmit happiness to one another, while personal friends did. But co-workers did transmit smoking habits; if a person at a small firm stopped smoking, his or her colleagues had a 34 percent better chance of quitting themselves. The difference is based in the nature of workplace relationships, Fowler contends. Smokers at work tend to cluster together outside the building; if one of them stops smoking, it reduces the conviviality of the experience. (If you're the last smoker outside on a freezing afternoon, your behavior can seem completely ridiculous even to yourself.) But when it comes to happiness, Fowler said, ''people are both cooperative and competitive at work. So when one person gets a raise, it might make him happy, but it'll make other people jealous.'' 
 Obesity had its own quirk: Spouses didn't appear to have as big an effect on each other as friends. If a male Framingham subject had a male friend who became fat, his risk doubled, but if his wife became obese, his risk was increased by only 37 percent. This, Christakis and Fowler say, is because when it comes to body image, we compare ourselves primarily to people of the same sex (and in the Framingham study, all spouses were of the opposite sex). In fact, different-sexed friends didn't transmit any obesity to one another at all. If a man became fat, his female friends were completely unaffected, and vice versa. Similarly, siblings of the same sex had a bigger impact on one another's weight than siblings of the opposite sex.
 When it came to drinking, Christakis and Fowler found a different kind of gender effect. Framingham women were considerably more influential than Framingham men. A woman who began drinking heavily increased the heavy-drinking risk of those around her, whereas heavy-drinking men had less effect on other people. Why? In the age of frat-party binge drinking, you might imagine that hard-partying men are the most risky people to be around. But Fowler says he suspects women are more influential precisely because they tend to drink less. When a woman starts drinking heavily, he says, it sends a strong signal to those around her that it's O.K. to start boozing too. 
 Christakis and Fowler's strangest finding is the idea that a behavior can skip links -- spreading to a friend of a friend without affecting the person who connects them. If the people in the middle of a chain are somehow passing along a social contagion, it doesn't make sense, on the face of it, that they wouldn't be affected, too. The two researchers say they don't know for sure how the link-jumping works. But they theorize that people may be able to pass along a social signal without themselves acting on it. If your friends at work become obese, even if you don't gain weight yourself, you might become more accepting of obesity as a normal state -- and unconsciously transmit that signal to your family members, who would then feel a sort of permission to gain weight themselves, knowing they wouldn't face any sort of censure from you. 
 Christakis and Fowler postulate that our ability to affect people three degrees away from us may have evolutionary roots -- and so may the very shape of human social networks. Tribal groups that were tightly connected were likely more able to pass along positive behaviors than those that weren't. Christakis and Fowler say social contagion could even help explain the existence of altruism: if we can pass on altruism to distant points in a network, it would help explain why altruistic people aren't simply constantly taken advantage of by other members of their community. Last year, to test this theory, they conducted a laboratory experiment in which participants played a ''cooperation game.'' Each participant was asked to share a sum of money with a small group and could choose to be either generous or selfish. Christakis and Fowler found that if someone was on the receiving end of a generous exchange, that person would become more generous to the next set of partners -- until the entire larger group was infected, as it were, with altruistic behavior, which meant the altruist would benefit indirectly. 
 CHRISTAKIS AND FOWLER'S work has produced a variety of reactions from other scientists. Many health care experts are thrilled. After years of observing patients, they suspected that behaviors spread socially; now there was data that appeared to prove it. ''It was an aha! moment,'' James O. Hill, a pioneering obesity researcher at the University of Colorado, Denver, said about the time in 2007 when he read the researchers' first obesity paper. Tom Valente, the director of the master's of public health program at the University of Southern California and an early investigator of the role of social networks in smoking behavior, was similarly excited. ''The Christakis and Fowler work is fantastic,'' he told me. Among public-health practitioners, he said, their theories have ''had amazing acceptance.'' 
 But many of those who study networks are more cautious in their reactions. Unlike medical experts, these scientists specialize in the study of networks themselves -- anything ranging from neighborhoods linked via the power grid to teenagers linked on Facebook -- and they are familiar with the difficulty of ascertaining cause and effect in such complex constructs. As they point out, the Framingham study has found intriguing correlations in people's behavior. Christakis and Fowler can show what appear to be waves of obesity or smoking moving across the map. But that doesn't prove social contagion is causing the spread. 
 There are at least two other possible explanations. One is ''homophily,'' the tendency of people to gravitate toward others who are like them. People who are gaining weight might well prefer to hang out with others who are also gaining weight, just as people who are happy might seek out others who are happy. The other possible explanation is that the shared environment -- and not social contagion -- might be causing the people of Framingham to change in groups. If a McDonald's opens up in a Framingham neighborhood, it could cause a cluster of people living nearby to gain weight or become slightly happier (or sadder, depending on what they think about McDonald's). The cluster of people would appear as though they are sharing a contagious form of behavior, but it would be an illusion. 
 Because of the confounding factors, as they are called, of homophily and the environment, many social scientists find themselves caught in an emotional bind when it comes to Christakis and Fowler's work. As Alex Pentland, former academic head of the M.I.T. Media Lab and an expert in unconscious social signals, told me, ''You couldn't prove what they say, but I happen to believe it.'' I heard precisely the same thing from many of Pentland's peers. They have all long suspected that human behavior is widely contagious; they just don't think Christakis and Fowler have proved their case. 
 One of Christakis and Fowler's most prominent critics is Jason Fletcher, an assistant professor of public health at Yale University. Last year, he and an economist named Ethan Cohen-Cole published two papers arguing that Christakis and Fowler had not successfully stripped out all possible homophily effects from their calculations. Fletcher initially wanted to replicate Christakis and Fowler's analysis of the data, but he didn't have access to their source; Christakis and Fowler have not published their network data, arguing that doing so would violate the privacy rights of the participants in the Framingham Heart Study. Faced with that obstacle, Fletcher and his colleague decided instead to test Christakis and Fowler's mathematical techniques on a different set of data: the Add Health study, a federal-government project that tracked the health of 90,118 students at 144 high schools and middle schools between 1994 and 2002. Among the questionnaires the researchers distributed was one that asked students to list up to 10 of their friends. This allowed Fletcher to build maps of how the friends at each school were linked, school by school, giving them a set of small social networks upon which to test Christakis and Fowler's math. (Before they stumbled upon the Framingham data, Christakis and Fowler themselves had considered using the Add Health surveys to look for social contagion. But they decided the data sets were too limited -- each of the schools had only several hundred students interlinked -- to produce results in which they could have confidence. They also wanted to study adults, figuring that the peer effects among teenagers are qualitatively different.) 
 When Fletcher analyzed the student cliques using statistical tools that he says are similar to those used by Christakis and Fowler, he found that social contagion indeed existed. But the behaviors and conditions that were apparently contagious were entirely implausible: they included acne, height and headaches. How could you become taller by hanging around with taller people? This, Fletcher concluded, called into doubt whether Christakis and Fowler's statistical techniques really removed homophily or environmental effects -- and he says this means the Framingham results are just as dubious. When I spoke to Fletcher, he said that he, too, believes social-contagion effects are real. ''We are on board with the idea that they exist and they're important,'' he added. But he simply isn't impressed by Christakis and Fowler's evidence. 
 Other scientists have pointed out another important limitation in Christakis and Fowler's work, which is that their map showing connections between the people of Framingham is necessarily incomplete. When the Framingham participants checked in every four years, they were asked to list all their family members -- but only one person they considered a close friend. This could arguably mean that those eerie three-degree effects might be an illusion. For example, if John lists Allison as his friend, and Allison lists Robert as her friend, and Robert lists Samantha as his friend, then Christakis and Fowler could conclude that John is three links away from Samantha. But what if John and Samantha actually know each other from church, but didn't have a way to indicate this on the Framingham forms? Then if John and Samantha both become slightly fatter, it might look like a social contagion is spreading through three social ties, via Allison and Robert, when in fact it's only spreading through one link, via church. 
 When I raised this concern with Christakis and Fowler, they agreed that their map of friendships isn't perfect. ''This is a general problem with our study and with any similar study,'' Christakis said. But he said he believes their map of the Framingham connections has far fewer holes than critics charge. When he and Fowler tallied up the green sheets, they often were able to deduce relationships between two people who didn't explicitly list each other as acquaintances -- reducing the number of false three-degree links. (One helpful fact was that many participants listed more than one friend, despite the instructions on the green sheets.) ''We are not overreaching our data,'' Christakis insisted. 
 He and Fowler also acknowledged that it is impossible to completely remove the problems of homophily and environmental effects. This doesn't mean they agree with Fletcher; in fact, they point out that in his height-and-acne paper, he used a somewhat looser mathematical model, one that makes it easier to produce spurious correlations between people -- which is why, they say, Fletcher found that acne and height were contagious. When they ran their own statistical technique on the Add Health data, they found that obesity followed precisely the same three-degree pattern of contagion as they found in Framingham. 
 And Christakis and Fowler point to two other findings to bolster their case for social contagion over environmental effects. One is that in the Framingham study, obesity seemed to be able to jump from friend to friend even over great distances. When people moved away, their weight gain still appeared to influence friends back in Massachusetts. In such cases, the local environment couldn't be making both gain weight, Christakis and Fowler say.
 Their other finding is more intriguing and arguably more significant: They discovered that behaviors appear to spread differently depending on the type of friendship that exists between two people. In the Framingham study, people were asked to name a close friend. But the friendships weren't always symmetrical. Though Steven might designate Peter as his friend, Peter might not think of Steven the same way; he might never designate Steven as a friend. Christakis and Fowler found that this ''directionality'' mattered greatly. According to their data, if Steven becomes obese, it has no effect on Peter at all, because he doesn't think of Steven as a close friend. In contrast, if Peter gains weight, then Steven's risk of obesity rises by almost 100 percent. And if the two men regard each other as mutual friends, the effect is huge -- either one gaining weight almost triples the other's risk. In Framingham, Christakis and Fowler found this directionality effect even among people who lived and worked very close to each other. And that, they argue, means it can't be the environment that is making people in Framingham fatter, since the environment ought to affect each of these friends equally. 
 ''If a McDonald's opens up nearby, it should make both of us gain weight simultaneously,'' Christakis adds. ''It shouldn't matter whether I nominate you as a friend or you nominate me.'' In fact, though, the directionality effect seems to matter very much, and that fact, in turn, buttresses the case for social contagion. 
 Duncan Watts, a social-network pioneer and a researcher for Yahoo, has reservations about some of Christakis and Fowler's findings -- for example, he thinks the fact that most of the Framingham participants listed only one friend ''really casts some doubt'' on the three-degrees theory. But he told me that the directionality effect is one finding that none of Christakis and Fowler's critics have been able to rebut. It is, for him, the strongest evidence that the Framingham results aren't just caused by the environment or by people flocking to others like them. ''I don't see how that can be explained any other way,'' he said. 
 IF YOU LOOK AT A CHART showing the change in smoking rates in the United States since the 1970s, it is a picture of early public-health success that soon tails off. In 1970, the smoking rate for adults was 37 percent. It fell to 33 percent by 1980 and then fell even more precipitously between 1980 and 1990. But after that, the rate at which people quit smoking began to slow. Between 2004 and 2005, in fact, the smoking rate stayed steady; on balance, nobody quit smoking those years. Antismoking forces successfully pushed the number of smokers down to one in five people, but they now seem stuck. Smoking-cessation experts have debated why it has become so hard to get the final holdouts to quit. Perhaps, some said, it was because the average cost of a pack of cigarettes remains largely unchanged nationally since 2002. 
 But there might be another, hidden reason: the shape of a smoker's social ties. When Christakis and Fowler mapped out the way Framingham people quit smoking during roughly the same period -- 1971 to 2003 -- they found that the decline was not evenly distributed across the town. Instead, clusters of friends all quit smoking at the same time, in a group. It was like a ballroom emptying out one table at a time. But this meant that by 2003, the remaining smokers were also not evenly distributed: instead, they existed in isolated, tightly knit clusters of like-minded nicotine fiends. Worse, those clusters had migrated to the edges of the social network, where they were less interlinked with the mass of Framingham participants. In their everyday social lives, Christakis and Fowler say, the town's remaining smokers are thus mostly surrounded by people who still smoke, and they rarely have strong connections with nonsmokers. Nonsmoking may be contagious, but the smokers don't appear to be close to anyone from whom they could catch the behavior. 
 The federal government has officially set a goal of reducing the number of smokers in the country to 12 percent of the population by 2010. But the very shape of our social networks is working against that goal, Fowler says, and this poses a potential public-health challenge. Meanwhile, public-health strategists who want to counteract obesity face the opposite problem. Since the country is gradually becoming more and more obese, when individual people do lose weight, they are more likely to be surrounded by people who are still heavy. If it's true that obesity can affect people even three links away, that may be one reason that people have such trouble keeping weight off. Even if they form a weight-loss group to lose weight with their close friends, they will still be influenced by obese people two or three links away -- people they barely know. ''We know that people are wildly successful in losing weight and wildly unsuccessful in keeping it off,'' Hill, the obesity researcher, says; he believes Framingham offers an important explanation of why this is. 
 In essence, Christakis and Fowler's work suggests a new way to think about public health. If they're right, public-health initiatives that merely address the affected individuals are doomed to failure. To really grapple with bad behaviors that spread, you have to simultaneously focus on individuals who are so distant they don't even realize they're affecting one another. Hill says this is possible with obesity. Last year, he collaborated with David Bahr, a physicist at Regis University in Denver, to construct a computer model of society that replicates the way obesity spreads. They created a simulation of hundreds of thousands of individuals, each programmed to influence one another in precisely the same way that Christakis and Fowler documented in Framingham. To test whether their model accurately mimicked reality, they seeded it with a few obese people and set it running. The virtual society slowly became obese in the same pattern and at the same rate as Framingham. If they could accurately copy the way Framingham became obese, they figured, they could then use the model to test different ways that the spread might be halted. They began trying different experiments -- like focusing on specific individuals and seeing whether or not they could use them to create a counterepidemic of skinniness. 
 One solution jumped out at them. In theory, the best way to fight obesity, the model predicted, isn't to urge people to diet with a cluster of close friends. It is to encourage them to skip a link and to diet with friends of friends. That way, in your immediate social network, everyone would be surrounded on at least one side by people who are actively losing weight, and this would in turn influence those other links to begin losing weight themselves. When Hill and Bahr ran the simulation with this sort of staggered dieting, it worked: the virtual society began slimming down, and the obesity epidemic reversed itself. ''It's like you have bridging dams to try and stop the flow,'' Bahr told me. (Bahr also found that the obesity epidemic could be reversed quickly, with only 1 percent of the entire population losing weight, so long as the dieters were placed in precisely the right spots. ''You don't need a lot of people, but you do need the right ones,'' he said.)
 In reality, of course, this sort of intervention would be quite difficult to pull off. You would have to figure out some way to persuade friends of friends to form dieting groups together. But other scientists have used Christakis and Fowler's work to inspire more potentially practical public-health projects, some of which are now being implemented. Nathan Cobb, a smoking-cessation expert and researcher at the Schroeder Institute for Tobacco Research and Policy Studies, is designing an application that Facebook users can install on their pages when they're trying to quit smoking. The application will publicly display how long they've gone without cigarettes, whether they are using a nicotine patch and how much money they have saved by not smoking. The idea, Cobb says, is to take your invisible, internal battle to quit smoking and make it visible so that it can influence your friends (and friends of friends) who are still puffing away. 
 IT'S TEMPTING TO think, confronted by Christakis and Fowler's work, that the best way to improve your life is to simply cut your ties to people with bad behavior. And obviously this is possible; people change their friends often, sometimes abruptly. But reshaping your social network may be more challenging than altering your behavior. There's also compelling evidence in their research that we do not have as much control as we might think we do over the way we're linked to other people: our location in a social network, say, or how many of our friends know each other. These patterns in our life are relatively stable, and they might, weirdly, be partly innate. 
 Christakis and Fowler first noticed this effect when they examined their happiness data. They discovered that people who were deeply enmeshed in friendship circles were usually much happier than ''isolates,'' those with few ties. But if an isolate did manage to find happiness, she did not suddenly develop more ties and migrate to a position where she was more tightly connected to others. The reverse was also true: if a well-connected person became unhappy, he didn't lose his ties and become an isolate. Your level of connectedness appears to be more persistent than even your overall temperament. ''If you picked up someone who's well connected and dropped them into another network, they'd migrate toward the center,'' Christakis said. Your place in the network affects your happiness, in other words, but your happiness doesn't affect your place in the network. 
 Christakis and Fowler began to wonder if a person's connectedness is to some degree fated from birth -- a product, at least in part, of DNA. To test the idea, they conducted a study of twins. Using the Add Health school data, they located more than 500 sets of twins and analyzed where they were located in their friendship clusters. Employing statistical techniques traditionally used to parse out how much of twins' lifestyles are attributable to their genes as opposed to their environment, they found that almost half -- 46 percent -- of the difference between two twins' levels of connectedness could be explained by DNA. ''On average,'' they wrote, ''a person with five friends has different genes than a person with one friend.'' More oddly still, twins also tended to have the same ''transitivity'': their friendship groupings had a strikingly similar degree of interlinking, which is the number of friends who knew one another. By and large, the people who were most tightly clustered in Framingham tended to be better off -- healthier, happier and even wealthier. (Several other economic studies have also found that better-connected people make more money.) But if half the reason these people were so well positioned is related to the accident of DNA, then you could consider connectedness a new form of inequality: lucky and unlucky cards, dealt out at birth. 
 Social-network science ultimately offers a new perspective on an age-old question: to what extent are we autonomous individuals? ''If someone does a good thing merely because they're copying others, or they do something bad merely because they're copying others, what credit do they deserve, or what blame do they deserve?'' Christakis asks. ''If I quit smoking because everyone around me quits smoking, what credit do I get'' for demonstrating self-control? If you're one of the people who are partly driven by his DNA to hang out on the periphery of society, well, that's also where the smokers are, which means you are also more likely to pick up their habit. 
 To look at society as a social network -- instead of a collection of individuals -- can lead to some thorny conclusions. In a column published last fall in The British Medical Journal, Christakis wrote that a strictly utilitarian point of view would suggest we should give better medical care to well-connected individuals, because they're the ones more likely to pass on the benefits contagiously to others. ''This conclusion,'' Christakis wrote, ''makes me uneasy.''
 Yet there is also, the two scientists argue, something empowering about the idea that we are so entwined. ''Even as we are being influenced by others, we can influence others,'' Christakis told me when we first met. ''And therefore the importance of taking actions that are beneficial to others is heightened. So this network thing can cut both ways, subverting our ability to have free will, but increasing, if you will, the importance of us having free will.'' 
 As Fowler pointed out, if you want to improve the world with your good behavior, math is on your side. For most of us, within three degrees we are connected to more than 1,000 people -- all of whom we can theoretically help make healthier, fitter and happier just by our contagious example. ''If someone tells you that you can influence 1,000 people,'' Fowler said, ''it changes your way of seeing the world.''

HEADLINE: Tales From Lehman's Crypt

BYLINE: By LOUISE STORY and LANDON THOMAS Jr.; Jenny Anderson contributed reporting.

 BODY:
TOM OLLQUIST remembers Sept. 9, 2008 -- the day Lehman Brothers laid him off -- as if it were yesterday. ''You're not going to believe it,'' he told his wife. ''I was shot.'' 
 Six days later, so was Lehman Brothers. Federal regulators let the foundering firm slip into bankruptcy, a collapse that touched off the most perilous week of the financial debacle, after years of freewheeling lending, trading and regulation produced outsize losses that devastated the banking system and brought the economy to its knees.
 For Mr. Ollquist, the implosion had direct consequences: he lost his job, his savings, and his dreams of kicking back and retiring soon to become a high school basketball coach. He now spends his days making cold calls and peddling bonds for a firm that few have ever heard of, missing the old days at Lehman when he sold mortgage securities to investors around the country.
 It was a good job, one that, if it did not make him rich by the gilded standards of Wall Street, still enabled him to buy the nicest house on his block in Hempstead, N.Y., less than a mile from his childhood home. His job also made him a member of a Lehman unit whose handiwork helped lead to the demise of the bank he loved and to an economic unraveling worldwide. 
 ''I have blood on my hands,'' Mr. Ollquist acknowledges, fiddling with several bracelets he wears, each with its own sentimental story, before he quickly ticks off a list of other parties he thinks are even more culpable than salesmen like him for the meltdown: regulators, senior executives, rival firms and traders who believed that their elaborate computer algorithms insulated them from risk.
 As he wrestles with his conscience, Mr. Ollquist is just one among legions of former Wall Streeters who continue to move past, adapt to or struggle with an event that has been a personal and professional watershed for all of them. Their industry was certainly battered, but, for the time being at least, it has demonstrated more resilience than some analysts predicted a year ago. 
 While many ordinary Americans are still waiting for an economic recovery, the very worst fears of the financial industry -- the nationalization of giant banks, tough new regulation, a second Great Depression -- haven't materialized. The global panic touched off by Lehman's collapse has receded, thanks largely to all those bailouts and other government life support for banks and firms that were principal architects of the mess. 
 True, thousands of financial industry jobs have vanished and several of the country's best-known banks and brokerage firms have disappeared. Since a peak in 2007, the market valuation of the country's 29 biggest financial services firms has been cleaved by about half. But significant parts of Wall Street endure, and some firms are raking in handsome profits. Indeed, many bankers and traders are looking forward to big bonuses once again.
 Some of those Lehman alumni who didn't manage to hang on to Wall Street jobs are still angry, bitter and confused; many others, like Mr. Ollquist, have moved on in their lives. The luckiest, like Ken Linton, a former Lehman trader, made enough money during the boom years to avoid having to think about their next paychecks. He spends his time flying jets. Others, unable to find banking jobs, are building new work lives. Jeff Schaefer, a former managing director, for instance, now owns a car wash and gas station in Florida. And, of course, there are those like Leslee Gelber, who is out of work, professionally adrift, and fearful that Wall Street will bounce back without her.
 THESE people worked together and occupied pivotal positions inside Lehman's securitization machine, bundling, trading or selling packages of mortgages, auto loans and other financial products. They worked alongside hundreds of other colleagues who, for the most part, were white, male, college-educated, and in their 30s and 40s. Many of them had been at Lehman their entire careers, often for more than a decade.
 The Lehman crew drank together, exercised together, vacationed together, dated one another, and kept constantly in touch day and night as they traded market information, gossip, and the ins and out of their personal lives. Once bound by the financial promise of their company stock, as well as a shared sense of professional purpose, they are now scattered far and wide, many of them tethered to parts of the banking industry that have survived or are regenerating.
 Those who worked with Mr. Ollquist never made headlines. But when the firm's C.E.O., Richard S. Fuld Jr., and his deputy, Joseph Gregory, pushed Lehman to be the No. 1 mortgage house on Wall Street from the comfortable remove of the executive suite atop the firm's Seventh Avenue headquarters in Manhattan, it was on the trading desk, 28 floors down, that this vision was built -- and where it disintegrated. 
 Yet few Lehman veterans, or their counterparts at other banks, blame themselves for the havoc their activities wrought. Instead, they point to the failures of regulators. 
 ''From a policy perspective, the regulators have to step in,'' says Richard McKinney, who oversaw mortgage trading at Lehman and in the firm's last year, the bundling of mortgages and other loans. ''It would be an awful lot to ask the Street to not look for revenue opportunities where their competitors are finding revenue.''
 Mr. McKinney left Lehman a month before the firm collapsed, to join a hedge fund. When asked whether he raised any red flags about problems in Lehman's mortgage business, he declined to discuss that, or any other aspects of his work at the firm. But he noted that financial companies are responsible for adequately managing their own risks. 
 Those much further down the corporate ladder from Mr. McKinney, including about two dozen people interviewed for this story, say they don't feel they deserve much blame for what happened at their firm. They were just following orders, they say.
 ''It is very human and understandable to feel the pressure of the time and respond accordingly,'' says Karen Brenner, a professor of business ethics and corporate governance at New York University. ''These people were operating in a culture where this behavior was prized and rewarded. But I think it is too easy to say, 'They made me do it; I don't have to examine what I did.' These people are professionals with duties and obligations to clients.''
 Reluctant to shoulder what they see as an unfair measure of blame for their bit parts in the financial meltdown, many former Lehmanites also note that their firm's demise visited dizzying and life-altering setbacks upon them as well. 
 ''I spent a long time being very angry,'' says Mr. Schaefer, the former Lehman executive turned gas station owner. ''Angry for working so hard and doing so much. More importantly, for my family and all the time I was away traveling -- the time I put in away from them. Now all that money I earned, the money paid in stock, is gone. I can't go back and remake it.''
 FLYING high in the New Mexican sky, Ken Linton gives little thought to the approaching anniversary of Lehman's collapse -- or his role in it. 
 A senior trader on Lehman's mortgage desk, Mr. Linton evaluated mortgages that were later sliced and diced into securitized investments. In his 13 years working at the firm, Mr. Linton, 43, impressed many with his intelligence. A native of Northern Ireland, he had earned a doctorate in engineering and computer science before moving to the United States to create models for Wall Street.
 In early 2007, Mr. Linton bought a small plane; it was just months before the mortgage market began to crater. His hobby seemed flashy and ego-driven to some of his peers. Asked about that, Mr. Linton says that ''anyone who works in Wall Street has an ego; otherwise they would not be there.'' 
 When Lehman closed its origination business, Mr. Linton lost his job. Rich and single, he has pursued a life of leisure since then -- sailing in his 37-foot boat, playing jazz trombone and, at the moment, taking a week to learn how to fly Russian fighter jets and gliders in New Mexico. He briefly considered attending culinary school. 
 Although Lehman laid him off in early 2008, his departure turned out to be a boon for Mr. Linton. Being forced out convinced him to bet against the firm's stock as a counterweight against the Lehman shares he still owned, which protected him when the stock's value plummeted. Combined with a well-timed sale of his Manhattan apartment and a stream of income from real estate investments, the moves gave him financial padding that frees him from job worries.
 ''I have been fortunate to have some nice toys,'' he says. ''And they are all paid up. It's a nice situation to be in.''
 He recalls vividly the days in early 2007 at Lehman when his financial models began to throw up more warnings showing delinquencies and defaults, and he remembers colleagues on his desk raising questions about loan quality. 
 But he said the firm's ranking as the top loan originator on Wall Street, not to mention the pressures put on the desk by Lehman's growth-obsessed leadership, made it difficult for even the most senior executives to raise questions, even a senior vice president like Mr. Linton. 
 He says he has no qualms about his work at Lehman or its economic aftereffects. ''Anyone at our level who had a different view from senior management would find themselves going somewhere else quick,'' he says. ''You are not paid to rock the boat.''
 Across the country, in Lithia, Fla., Jeff Schaefer, who helped oversee mortgage originations as a Lehman managing director, is now running a Mobil gas station and a car wash. His office is the size of one of Lehman's broom closets. Time is punctuated by the ring-ding chime of people coming in and out of the heat for a Bud Light or frozen Icees, and the screen before him shows the store's images from security cameras -- a far cry from the Bloomberg terminals that dotted Lehman's desks. 
 Just two years ago, Mr. Schaefer supervised sales at Aurora Loan Services, Lehman's mortgage-origination arm in Colorado. In the boom years, he led a 400-person team that stockpiled often-risky mortgages to disperse to the firm's financial engineers and salesmen. He used to talk with Mr. Linton three to four times a day to get his marching orders on mortgage pricing and credit standards. It was those conversations, he says, that helped him decide whether to require borrowers to document their income or whether to give them so-called no-doc loans.
 It has been a year and a half since Lehman dismissed Mr. Schaefer, but still, when the 51-year-old father of two thinks of the money he lost in Lehman stock, ''that's when the anger comes,'' he says. But his anger was tempered, he says, by conversations he has had with his former employees who are faring much more poorly than he is.
 The fall of Lehman, he also says, has affected his wife as much as him. She crisscrossed the country with him and their children to advance his career, bouncing from Texas to Florida to Colorado. So when he decided to buy a car wash, he let her choose their next destination, Florida. 
 Too many people, he says, blame firms like Lehman, but he says all that Lehman did was create a product that investors were demanding to buy from the firm.
 ''How do you blame us? A lot of what we did from an origination standpoint was based on investors' appetite,'' he says. ''Do you think we would just go out and say, 'I think we're going to do $100 million in no-doc loans?' ''
 Mr. Schaefer says he isn't ashamed of his Lehman work, but he doesn't bring Lehman up when he meets neighbors in Florida. He also still encourages his college-age son's goal of becoming a trader, a dream hatched in visits with his father to Lehman's mortgage desk in New York.
 His wife recently asked him whether he'll ever dive back into the securities business. 
 ''I don't know,'' he says. ''You know what I miss? I miss the pressure. That's what I love. I love the pressure. I just don't have that here.''
 IN some ways, daily life seems barely different for Mr. Ollquist. He's back doing what he has done for a quarter-century: selling. But this time he's marketing plain-vanilla bonds at a little-known, Swiss-owned firm named Tradition instead of circulating collateralized debt obligations for Lehman. 
 His train from Long Island leaves 11 minutes later than his old one. The trading floor still hums. His mascot -- a stuffed moose -- still looks down as he works the phones. And weekends are free for golf at the Hempstead Golf and Country Club.
 But sometimes, it all comes back. He slips and answers his phone ''Lehman!'' He walks by Lehman's old headquarters and is still surprised to see the building lit up in Barclays blue -- the colors of the firm that acquired parts of Lehman in bankruptcy -- rather than Lehman green. He says he will steer his oldest son, who just left for college, away from a Wall Street career. The Street, he says, no longer offers the opportunities it once did. 
 A salesman's smile appears when he is asked about his regrets. He's 45 and had hoped to retire at 50 to become a coach. That will have to wait a bit. His wife, he says, recently finished secretarial school, and he hopes she can add to their income. He says his Lehman stock was worth $6.5 million at the start of 2008. Its value fell to just pennies when Lehman filed for bankruptcy.
 People close to him sense a sadness in Mr. Ollquist. His older brother, John, who retired from Lehman in 1997, can hardly remember the name of the Swiss firm Mr. Ollquist works for now. 
 ''What the heck is the name of that place? Oh yeah, Tradition,'' said John Ollquist, who refers to his younger brother by his nickname, Moose. ''It's a different kind of firm, you understand, from Lehman Brothers. People don't call Tradition. Moose has to go out and say, 'If you like these prices, I can get them.' At Lehman, he could say, 'We own them; we can sell them to you for this price.' I don't know if it's better or worse, but it's probably harder.''
 For Leslee Gelber, though, there is no doubt: life is getting harder by the day. Her fortunes twisted later than others who lost their jobs before Lehman collapsed. 
 Last year at this time, in fact, Ms. Gelber felt like a winner. She was one of three survivors in a banking unit that had laid off 22 people in 10 months. Forty-three years old and single, she had made it in a male-dominated world, often taking on much larger workloads than her peers. 
 She thought Lehman would make it, and so would she. ''We felt like we were lucky to have survived,'' she recalls.
 But on the morning of the bankruptcy filing, her life fell apart. Walking into work, she turned to an Associated Press reporter and said what many of her colleagues feared: I've got no job prospects. Her words were blasted everywhere, even in newspapers in her native Montreal.
 The next months were anxious for most people sitting inside Lehman's building. Barclays had taken over and the firm took weeks to decide who would make the cut. Barclays dismissed Ms. Gelber in January.
 She immediately threw herself into the job hunt, blasting scores of resumes to employers and government agencies like the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. She took three business school classes and several seminars. She hired a tutor to teach her a mortgage computer system. Chipper, energetic and organized, it seemed just a matter of time until someone would snap her up. 
 Almost no one called. Her business -- the purchasing of mortgages to bundle -- is still moribund. Though she wants to stay in New York, she is applying to jobs across the country, hoping she will catch someone's eye. She's open to change, but she has found that no one wants talk with her about jobs outside her area of expertise. She says she is still optimistic that the mortgage markets will rebound.
 The gym has become Ms. Gelber's haven. She takes a spinning class and goes running. It helps keep her sane, she says. 
 ''To not have a job doesn't feel good,'' she says. ''I like going to the office, having structure in my life.''
 She's tried to spend more time volunteering, but several hospitals have told her they have no room for additional volunteers. She's tried to network at conferences, but the conferences, which are pricey, are often half empty. 
 The hardest part is all the downtime, she says. When she's not in classes or at the gym, she's in her apartment surfing the Web for jobs. She has forgone any big vacations this year because she says she ''won't enjoy it, knowing I don't have a job.''
 The year has been by far the hardest of her life, she says, even harder for her personally than after the Sept. 11 attacks that convinced Lehman, which was once located near the World Trade Center, to move its headquarters uptown. She said she was home sick that day and did not lose anyone she knew. So for her, life moved on, because Lehman moved on and she had a place.
 The battle now, she says, is a lonely one. ''It's mental,'' she confides. 
 ''I can't sit home like this,'' she continues, her voice rising. ''I want to work. Lehman was who I was. I really loved it there. I was proud to be there.''

HEADLINE: But Who Is Watching Regulators?

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
NOTHING succeeds like failure, as the saying goes. And nowhere is this dismal truth more evident than in our financial regulatory system, one year after the bankruptcy filing of Lehman Brothers. 
 Even though calamitous lending practices laid waste to the nation's economy, surprisingly little has changed about how the financial arena operates and is supervised. Sure, a couple of venerable brokerage firms have vanished, but many of the same players remain on the scene, in the same positions of power. 
 Senior regulators who stood idly by for years as financial firms built their houses of cards have been rewarded with even bigger jobs or are jockeying for increased responsibilities. The Federal Reserve Board, for example, wants to become the financial system's uber-regulator, even though its officials did nothing as banks made deadly decisions to lend recklessly and leverage themselves to the max. 
 Awarding increased power to those who failed in their oversight duties flies in the face of all notions of accountability. Imagine hiring Angelo R. Mozilo, the former chief of Countrywide Financial, to run a global financial institution, or installing E. Stanley O'Neal, who presided over a disastrous period at Merrill Lynch, at the helm of a major investment firm. 
 Yet those in the public sector ask us to believe that regulators who snoozed during the credit bubble will be alert to emerging problems on their beats when the next mania begins. 
 That's asking a lot, isn't it? 
 Here's a novel thought. Instead of creating more regulations to try to prevent this kind of mess from recurring, why not figure out how to hold regulators accountable when they perform as poorly as they did in recent years? 
 Edward J. Kane, a professor of finance at Boston College and an authority on the ethical and operational aspects of regulatory failure, has some ideas about how to do this and right our damaged system in the process. He outlined them in a recent paper titled ''Unmet Duties in Managing Financial Safety Nets.'' 
 This ugly financial episode we've all had to live through makes clear, Mr. Kane says, that taxpayers must protect themselves against two things: the corrupting influence of bureaucratic self-interest among regulators and the political clout wielded by the large institutions they are supposed to police. Finally, he argues, taxpayers must demand that the government publicize the costs of efforts taken to save the financial system from itself. 
 ''That authorities and financiers could so callously violate common-law duties of loyalty, competence, and care they owe taxpayers and financial-institution customers is evidence of a massive incentive breakdown in industry and government,'' Mr. Kane writes. ''This breakdown cannot be repaired merely by replacing the governing political party or by changing the jurisdictions and mission statements of regulatory agencies.''
 It's tough, however, to assign responsibility to regulators who routinely fend off or stymie anyone attempting to scrutinize how the cops on the beat functioned in the years preceding the financial meltdown. So everyday Americans need to kick and scream if they want some light shed on this critical epoch in our financial history. 
 To bring accountability to regulatory performance, Mr. Kane suggests that financial supervisors take an oath of office in which they agree to perform four duties. First is the duty of vision, under which they would promise to adapt their surveillance practices to respond to the creative ways financial institutions hide their dubious practices. Regulators must also promise to take prompt corrective action, and to perform their work efficiently. Finally, there is what Mr. Kane calls the duty of ''conscientious representation,'' whereby regulators swear to put the interests of the community ahead of their own.
 This last promise gets to the heart of a continued erosion of trust in our system, Mr. Kane argues. ''If real world supervisors were perfectly virtuous, they would make themselves politically and financially accountable for the ways in which they exercise their discretion,'' he writes. ''Perfectly virtuous supervisors would fearlessly bond themselves to disclose enough information about their decision making to allow the community or interested outsiders to determine whether and how badly they neglect, abuse, or mishandle their responsibilities.''
 Instead, our regulators refuse to produce complete documentation and accounts of the actions they took during the crisis. And keeping taxpayers in the dark isn't exemplary ethical behavior. Rather, it is characteristic of what Mr. Kane calls an elitist regulator, one who uses crises to cover up mistakes and expand his or her jurisdiction.
 ''According to this standard,'' Mr. Kane writes, ''Fed efforts to use the crisis as a platform for self-congratulation and for securing enlarged systemic-risk authority sidetracks, rather than promotes, effective reform.''
 To ensure that regulators live up to the promises they make, Mr. Kane suggests that inspectors general at each agency be charged with regularly auditing the performance of financial overseers. A crucial component of those reviews would be exploring attempts by regulated entities to influence the officials who oversee them. That's because in financial crises, Mr. Kane explained, crippled institutions pressure the government to rescue them and force other parties (usually the taxpayers) to share their pain. 
 ''We've got a very comfortable equilibrium here where Wall Street praises the authorities and the authorities give Wall Street more or less what it wants and they hope that the public really doesn't understand the depth of the cynicism involved,'' Mr. Kane said in an interview. ''You keep reading about how wonderful it is that we didn't have a Great Depression. Well, if they can sell that point of view, then nothing will change.''

BYLINE: By ALISON GREGOR

 BODY:
A GLANCE at Lawrence Greene's rustic colonial with wraparound porch in Livingston Manor, N.Y., might lead one to believe it's a 150-year-old farmhouse. In fact, it's two years old, one of the greenest houses in New York State, and built in a factory.
 The 1,800-square-foot structure was constructed by New World Home, a company that offers environmentally responsible prefabricated houses in a variety of architectural styles. 
 Mr. Greene, a trademark lawyer with a Manhattan firm, bought the three-bedroom modular house for $360,000 in March and uses it on weekends.
 ''It's a house that one can feel good about living in if one is trying to live green,'' Mr. Greene said. ''At the same time, one can enjoy the house because it has such an innate charm.''
 The eco-friendly aspect of the house is enhanced by the use of vintage appointments, like two 1860 fireplace mantels from brownstones in New York City, antique chandeliers and an elderly claw-foot tub. Mr. Greene said he had to convince the building inspector that it wasn't a restored house. But, at the same time, plumbers and electricians have marveled at the hardware in his very 21st-century basement.
 New World Home ''applies great ingenuity, not only in terms of how to build a house that's ecologically favorable, but also that is aesthetically enviable,'' Mr. Greene said.
 Modular construction -- houses manufactured as modules at a factory and then assembled on site -- is inherently greener than conventional ''stick-built'' construction, said Mark Jupiter, a founder and the president of the product division of New World, which is two years old and has headquarters in Manhattan. Fewer materials are used and less waste is generated, he said.
 ''The efficiencies and economies of scale that a factory brings just blow site-built houses out of the water, if done right,'' Mr. Jupiter said.
 New World's houses have more than two dozen other features that make them eco-friendly, including metal roofing with recycled content and motion-detecting light switches. They have hookups for mechanical systems like solar panels, geothermal energy or wind turbines, but don't depend upon them for their green status.
 ''A green house, to truly call it that, can't rely on mechanical systems,'' Mr. Jupiter said. ''The only thing that's truly going to make a house green is the thermal envelope being as tight as possible. That means building a house that doesn't leak at all, combined with proper insulation for the region, and choosing to eliminate contaminants within the construction materials.''
 The houses cut energy consumption in half and reduce water use by 20,000 gallons annually, providing homeowners with big savings, beginning the first day of occupancy, Mr. Jupiter said.
 Mr. Greene's house has double-paned windows for insulation, and ceiling fans and cross-ventilation cool the home without air-conditioning.
 ''The front door doesn't even have a storm door,'' Mr. Greene said. ''And it's so secure and airtight that no cold air gets inside in the winter, and it's perfectly cool when you walk inside in the summer on the hottest day.''
 New World Home doesn't build its own homes, but gives its specifications to modular builders like Future Home Technology in New York and Haven Custom Homes of Maryland. The houses can be built for as little as $70,000 with no upper limit on price for custom-built homes, said Tyler Schmetterer, the company's other founder and chief operating officer.
 Only two or three companies now produce green modular housing routinely, and typically their prices range from $250 to $800 a square foot. New World averages about $150 to $200 a square foot. The company is also exploring affordable housing, which would be $70 a square foot.
 Both Mr. Schmetterer and Mr. Jupiter acknowledge that they've had to struggle to overcome a stereotype that plagues the modular construction industry -- one of flimsy wooden structures and unattractive vinyl siding.
 ''That stigma is slowly but surely becoming archaic and will eventually become extinct,'' Mr. Jupiter said.
 New World Home's principals say they can build a house in 60 to 90 days. If homeowners choose, they can apply for certification from the United States Green Building Council and the National Green Building Program. This can be useful in states that encourage green building practices, like New York, which will offer up to $7,500 per qualifying single-family home starting Jan 1.
 ''Eventually, if people decide to move, the green certification should significantly contribute to the resale value of the home as well,'' Mr. Schmetterer said.
 New World Home is partnering with developers to create subdivisions in about 10 states, along with individual homes. Besides Mr. Greene's, New World has completed one in Jeffersonville, N.Y., and now has houses under construction in East Hampton, Millbrook and Cornwall, N.Y.
 Mr. Greene said he bought his weekend home for its quaint historic ambience more than anything else.
 ''The idea that the home was eco-friendly was, in a way, icing on the cake, because it was so delightful in many ways,'' he said. ''So I do my best to uphold the standard by not doing things like applying weed killer or insecticides to the lawn. I'm really trying to do things that are ecologically sensitive now.''

HEADLINE: Mileage Champs See the U.S.A. at 67.9 M.P.G.

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON

 BODY:
THE Volkswagen Jetta TDI rolled gently to a stop at the red light -- no squealing brakes, no smoking tires. On the dashboard, the trip computer display read 62 miles per gallon. 
 For John Taylor, that was not very good.
 Days earlier, Mr. Taylor and his wife, Helen, had completed a 48-state drive averaging 67.9 miles a gallon: 9,505 miles in 19 days, filling up only 13 times and spending a total of $371.03 for diesel fuel. That beat the Guinness record of 58.8 miles a gallon they set a year ago on nearly the same route in an almost identical 2009 Jetta TDI. 
 One difference this time was the tires. The Jetta was fitted with Goodyear Assurance Fuel Max tires, low-rolling-resistance models that will be standard equipment on the 2011 Chevrolet Volt. 
 Goodyear, a sponsor of the Taylors' drive, says the new tire reduces rolling resistance by 27 percent compared with the conventional Assurance tire it replaces, which translates to a 4 percent improvement in highway fuel economy.
 In Goodyear's testing, at least. But the record-setting Taylors, who are Australian, have long made a specialty of going as far as possible on as little fuel as possible, and they hold more than 40 Guinness records for fuel-efficient driving.
 They do not care what kind of fuel they are conserving. They have set some records in cars powered by diesel engines, like the Jetta, and some in cars that run on gasoline. They have set records in cars with manual transmissions like the 6-speed Jetta. They have set records in cars with automatics.
 They have driven long distances in spartan subcompacts like the Ford Fiesta, and they hold records for fuel-sipping in thirsty luxury cars. Three years ago they drove around the world in a Volkswagen Golf using only 24 tanks of gasoline, averaging about 52.2 miles a gallon.
 Still another of their records is for driving a Jaguar with a V-8 engine 680 miles on less than one tank of fuel -- about 32 miles a gallon, not quite double the car's highway fuel economy rating.
 All this raised an obvious question: Is it possible to get better-than-average mileage in New York, the world capital of dashboard-pounding, outta-my-way driving?
 It took less than an hour to find out. Mr. Taylor did the driving, even though, he said, his wife was better when it came to getting the highest mileage. 
 From the back seat, Mrs. Taylor said that they had stopped doing mileage demonstration runs for reporters the way they once did: put an egg under the accelerator, drive for a while, then let the reporter try to equal their mileage.
 ''We never broke the egg,'' she said. ''The journalists did.'' Car companies were not happy about the mess.
 So now their demonstrations are egg-free, but their tips and tricks for going easy on the gas are the same. Among them: no jackrabbit starts, no high-speed cruising, no hard-braking stops and no idling at traffic lights.
 ''Simple behavioral stuff,'' Mr. Taylor said, heading north on the West Side Highway from Midtown Manhattan. They have posted a list of 30 tips on their Web site, fuelacademy.com. 
 Within seconds, Mr. Taylor put several into practice. One was to shift into the highest possible gear as soon as practical. Another was to keep an eye on traffic conditions ahead. He explained another when the Jetta was going about 40 miles an hour in fairly heavy midday traffic and the traffic light half a block away changed to red. 
 ''There's no point in racing up to a red light,'' Mr. Taylor said. 
 He had set the mileage indicator to give moment-by-moment readings, not an average for the trip. It showed three dashes, as it does while coasting, when the fuel consumption is so low that the numbers are meaningless. He rolled to a gentle stop, using the brakes lightly. 
 When the light turned green, Mr. Taylor started out gently too. He was the last off the line -- the cars in the other lanes sped away and were long gone by the time he reached 45 miles an hour. That was fine with him. ''If you're over-revving,'' he said, ''you use a third more fuel on the takeoff.''
 As the Jetta headed toward the George Washington Bridge, Mr. Taylor held his speed between 40 and 45, even though the speed limit was 50 miles an hour. ''We're sitting 5, 6, 7 miles under the legal limit,'' he said. 
 And getting 74.8 miles a gallon, according to the car's mileage indicator.
 No, he said as the Jetta slowed down again, he was not worried about speedsters from behind. ''If they run up our derriere,'' he said, ''they're going too fast to begin with. 
 ''And if you're riding the next guy's tail, you're hitting the brakes all the time. The key is patience. You don't need to hurry. If you got a world-champion racing driver in a Ferrari, guess what? At the next light, you'll see the Ferrari.'' 
 He turned around in Yonkers, shutting off the engine at a traffic light that was red for nearly a minute. Soon the Jetta was headed back to Manhattan and the mileage indicator showed the three dashes again. 
 ''It's a 45 zone,'' he said. ''This is what we did 14 hours a day for 19 days. It's not rocket science.''

 BODY:
O.K. Oliver Stone already has a screenplay for ''Wall Street 2,'' the sequel to his culturally resonant 1987 dissection of financial ruthlessness. He has been busy shooting it in Manhattan. If he has second thoughts about the project, he might consider these alternative plotlines: 
 GOING GREEN AND LOVING IT
A scrum of paparazzi and reporters greet Gordon Gekko as he exits the federal penitentiary, and he amiably stops for a few questions, confirming that, yes -- it's true -- one of Wall Street's most notorious ex-cons will commence a series of ethics lectures at business schools across the country. ''Nobody knows the perils of the dark side like I do,'' he says with a knowing, repentant smile.
 In between lectures to future M.B.A.'s, Gekko preaches about the hazards of a warming planet to anyone who will listen. Weaning ourselves from oil is not just good for the planet, he explains, it's good for the economy. And he sets out to prove it by creating his own wind power company, American Breeze. ''The Nation's Most Improbable Farmer'' reads the cover of Newsweek, with a photo of Gekko amid a row of wind towers. The government chips in with stimulus money; private backers line up.
 American Breeze creates an immense and thriving secondary market in energy credits. Gekko is hailed as the ''Al Gore of Commerce.''
 It's all a charade. In prison, Gekko had noticed that not one of the top executives at the top, or near the top, of any of the financial firms that gave us the Great Recession has been indicted, let alone sent to prison. ''Greed is legal,'' he says during a private moment, updating his most famous epigram.
 American Breeze is mostly a fraud; seven of its wind farms are nothing more than a collection of unloaded semi-trucks with steel beams. But Gekko earns a fortune selling energy credits to notorious polluters.
 He might retire rich and acclaimed -- if he can win over Bud Fox, his former protege. Fox, a successful software executive, never bought the idea of the ''reformed'' Gekko, and his latest computer program penetrated the scam that is American Breeze's books. Will Gekko once again persuade Fox to ignore his moral compunctions and partake of the booty? If yes, will Fox then have another crisis of conscience and turn again on Gekko?
 Guess.

HEADLINE: The Retreat of the Tongue of the Czars

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY

DATELINE: SIMFEROPOL, Ukraine 

 BODY:
 IN a corner of Bukvatoriya, a bookstore here in the capital of the Crimean Peninsula, are some stacks of literature that may be as provocative to the Kremlin as any battalion of NATO soldiers or wily oligarch.
 The books are classics -- by Oscar Wilde, Victor Hugo, Mark Twain, and Shakespeare -- that have been translated into Ukrainian, in editions aimed at teenagers. A Harry Potter who casts spells in Ukrainian also inhabits the shelves.
 Two decades ago, there would have been little if any demand for such works, given that most people in this region are ethnic Russians. But the Ukrainian government is increasingly requiring that the Ukrainian language be used in all facets of society, especially schools, as it seeks to ensure that the next generation is oriented toward Kiev, not Moscow. 
 Children can even read Pushkin, Russia's most revered author, in translation. (This tends to bother Russians in the way that ''The Star-Spangled Banner'' sung in Spanish can touch off cross-cultural crankiness in the United States.)
 The Ukrainian policy has become a flashpoint in relations between the two countries and reflects the diminishing status of the Russian language in not just the former Soviet Union, but the old Communist bloc as a whole.
 The Kremlin has tried to halt the decline by setting up foundations to promote the study of Russian abroad and by castigating neighbors who shove the language from public life. In some nations, a backlash against Russian has stirred its own backlash in the language's defense.
 Still, the challenge is considerable. At stake is more than just words on a page.
 Language imparts power and influence, binding the colonized to the colonizers and, for better or worse, altering how native populations interact with the world. Long after they gave up their territories, Britain and France and Spain have retained a certain authority in far-flung outposts because of the languages that they seeded.
 Czars and Soviet leaders spread Russian in the lands that they conquered, using it as a kind of glue to unite disparate nationalities, a so-called second mother tongue, and connect them to their rulers. That legacy endures today, as exemplified by the close relationship between Russia and Germany, which stems in part from Chancellor Angela Merkel's ability to speak Russian. She learned it growing up in Communist East Germany.
 But with the language in retreat, there are unlikely to be many future Angela Merkels. For the Kremlin, could there be a more bitter reminder of how history has turned than the sight of young Estonians or Georgians or Uzbeks (not to mention Czechs or Hungarians) flocking to classes in English instead of Russian?
 ''The drop in Russian language usage is a great blow to Moscow, in the economic and social spheres, and many other respects,'' said Aleksei V. Vorontsov, chairman of the sociology department at the Herzen State Pedagogical University in St. Petersburg. ''It has severed links, and made Russia more isolated.''
 Russian seems to be faring more poorly than other colonial languages because the countries that had to absorb it have a more cohesive sense of national identity and are now rallying around their native languages to assert their sovereignty.
 Russian is one of the few major languages to be losing speakers, and by rough estimates, that total will fall to 150 million by 2025, from 300 million in 1990, a year before the Soviet collapse. It will probably remain one of the 10 most popular languages, but barely. Mandarin Chinese, English, Spanish, Arabic and Hindi head the list.
 The situation has not been helped by the demographic crisis in Russia itself, which is expected to shed as much as 20 percent of its population by 2050.
 The fall in Russian speakers has not been uniform across the former Soviet Union, and Russian officials praise former Soviet republics like Kyrgyzstan where Russian is embraced.
 But countries that felt subjugated by Soviet power, like the Baltic States, have taken vengeance by mandating knowledge of the native language to obtain citizenship or other benefits. (As a correspondent in the former Soviet Union, I find that in some countries, I can often speak Russian with people older than 40 and English with those younger.)
 The dispute is vitriolic in Ukraine, especially here on the Crimean Peninsula on the Black Sea, a former Russian territory where about 60 percent of the population of two million is ethnic Russian and others also speak Russian as a first language. Many residents here would prefer that Russia reclaim Crimea.
 Ukraine's pro-Western president, Viktor A. Yushchenko, indicated this month that a deepening understanding of the Ukrainian language is one key to keeping Moscow at bay. ''With our native language, we preserve our culture,'' Mr. Yushchenko told the German magazine Spiegel. ''That greatly contributes to preserving our independence. If a nation loses its language, it loses its memory, its history and its identity.''
 The policies in Ukraine, the Baltics and other countries have often drawn the ire of not only the Kremlin, but also local Russian speakers.
 At the Bukvatoriya bookstore in Simferopol, the manager, Irina P. Germanenko, said locals were upset by ''Ukrainization'' -- laws compelling the Ukrainian language in government, on television and in other areas.
 Many schools in Crimea use Russian as their primary language, but they often must teach courses in subjects like geography and math in Ukrainian. And important national examinations are given only in Ukrainian.
 Most of Bukvatoriya's stock is in Russian, but Ms. Germanenko said sales of books for teenagers in Ukrainian showed the policy's impact. ''It's an unfortunate process that is occurring,'' she said. ''People should be able to have freedom of choice in their language.''
 The resentment can bubble up in unexpected locales. When Tajikistan, a former Soviet republic in Central Asia, said this summer that it would demote the status of Russian, requiring government documents to be only in the Tajik language, an outcry arose from those who saw Russian as a bridge to Russia and the outside world. And in former Soviet satellites in Europe, where Russian was essentially purged after Communism, there has been a small but noticeable revival.
 The language is obviously helpful in doing business in Russia's sizable market, so interest in Russian-language classes is rising. The lingua franca of Communism, it seems, is now an asset in the pursuit of capitalism.

the government maintains a language inspection service. Ukraine Russian is widely spoken by both Ukrainians and a sizeable minority of ethnic Russians, but government is mandating use of Ukrainian in schools and other areas. Georgia Russian-language programs are banned from many television channels and radio stations. Turkmenistan Russian-language schools and newspapers shut down.
MIXED FEELINGS: Armenia and Azerbaijan Russian is not an official language, although top officials and people in large cities speak it. Moldova Semi-official language. Uzbekistan Russian is not an official language, but some schools use it as a primary language. Tajikistan Russian is still used, but a recently proposed law would require government documents to be written only in Tajik.
 FRIENDLY TO RUSSIAN: Belarus Russian is an official language, along with Belarusian. Kazakhstan Russian is an official language, along with Kazakh. Kyrgyzstan Official language, although presidential candidates must pass a language test in Kyrgyz.

HEADLINE: A Feast for the Eyes and Ears

BYLINE: By DEBORAH SCHOENEMAN

DATELINE: San Francisco 

 BODY:
 AT a recent dinner party at Project One, an art gallery and D.J. lounge in the Potrero Hill design district here, guests were instructed to bring an organic dish to share, along with their own plates.
 ''We're making the recession sexy,'' said Brooke Waterhouse, a bubbly blonde wearing a thick coat of silver eye shadow and an antique gold lion pendant around her neck. 
 Last fall, she opened the club with her husband, the British technology entrepreneur Steve Waterhouse. Since then, the monthly art openings and frequent benefits have attracted a devoted and eclectic clientele, including local celebrities like the iPod designer Jonathan Ive and Stephan Jenkins, the lead singer of Third Eye Blind. 
 When there are no private parties, the doors are open to the public -- mostly an iPhone wielding, 30-something set in vintage sneakers sipping wine, beer or herb-infused soju cocktails. D.J.'s spin electronic music under the disco ball, fog and green laser lights. On this evening, members of the city's designerati dined in the gallery, which featured a monthlong show of work by eight local artists, ranging from $100 to $5,000. A $1,500 Peter Samuels photograph of a mop head sold on opening night. ''It's a great entry point, especially in this economy, for first-time collectors,'' said Sabrina Buell, the West Coast director of the Matthew Marks Gallery, who attended the party.
 Other guests included Riley Johndonnell, a founder of Surface magazine; Joe Haller and Ian Hannula from the fashion label Nice Collective; and industrial designers from Apple, who also gather at the club once a month for an electric disco night hosted by Markus Diebel, the vice president for design at InCase, which makes protective cases for handheld devices.
 ''My intent was to establish a forum for creative people who care about minimal house, techno and nu-disco,'' Mr. Diebel wrote by e-mail. He named his monthly party Turbo, after the turbocharged cars popular in the late 1970s. 
 After traveling around the world with her husband for inspiration, Mrs. Waterhouse oversaw the design of the 3,200-square-foot lounge, with metal birds affixed to the wall in a flight pattern (crafted by the artist Laura Kimpton, of the hotel family). An eight-foot-tall steel candelabra sits on the rustic wood bar, which was imported from Bolinas, the surf enclave. 
 ''Cape Town and Tokyo were big influences,'' Mrs. Waterhouse said of her aesthetic choices.
 Mr. Waterhouse, a recreational D.J., installed a sophisticated sound system that has drawn celebrity D.J.'s like Hercules and Love Affair, Rich Medina and Harvey Bassett (a k a D.J. Harvey). Although there's an emphasis on dancing with abandon and unconventional fashion flairs, the Waterhouses try to keep the crowd discerning and art-focused. 
 ''We're not really a Burning Man bar,'' Mrs. Waterhouse said. ''We're a little more sophisticated than that, but we all go there.''
 The club often gets a permit to stay open as late as 4 a.m. There's no sign on the door and Facebook updates are the only promotions. The Waterhouses hold court practically every night and Mrs. Waterhouse's brother tends bar.
 ''We're passionate about music and art,'' Mr. Waterhouse said. ''And we wanted a place to hang out with our friends.''

HEADLINE: Artists Without Mortarboards

BYLINE: By ROBERTA SMITH

 BODY:
IN an often quoted remark the Abstract Expressionist Barnett Newman once said, ''Aesthetics is for artists what ornithology is for birds.'' I wonder what Newman would make of the overflow of M.F.A.-bearing would-be artists pouring out of art schools and universities these days. Maybe he'd say, ''An artist without a graduate degree is like a fish without a bicycle.'' 
 The professionalization and academicization of the art world has been lamented for some years, but lately they have become epidemic. The recent inflated art market has created the illusion that being an artist is a financially viable calling. Meanwhile art schools and universities -- which often provide tenure (safe haven) for artists who may be taken seriously nowhere else -- expanded to accommodate the rising number of art students and are now thoroughly invested in keeping these numbers high. 
 In this context the growing interest among art schools and universities (mostly abroad so far) in offering a Ph.D. in art makes the blood run cold. It also seems like rank, even cynical commercial opportunism. It's too soon to tell, but I'd like to think that the economic downturn is doing serious damage to this trend and maybe even put budding artists off graduate school entirely. 
 This brings me to a project that could make the coming season especially exciting: the unaccredited, free art school that the artist collective known as the Bruce High Quality Foundation started Friday in a downtown Manhattan space lent by a benefactor it has declined, so far, to identify. Whoever shows up will have a hand in the formation of Bruce High Quality Foundation University, which is being made up as it goes along.
 The Bruces, as the members of the five-year-old group are often called, guard their anonymity fiercely. But they are generally known to be a band of artists, all male, some of whom became friends while undergraduates at Cooper Union in the late '90s, when Hans Haacke, one of the fathers of institutional critique, was still teaching there. 
 Like any small group with a good idea, they benefit from the fact that the art world is in many ways one of the least regulated occupational spheres on the planet. As a result it is unusually susceptible, on a local level, to being altered and improved by the actions of a few good men or women. 
 This has recently been proved by started-from-scratch ventures as modest as Orchard, a Lower East Side collective-as-art-gallery, and Pocket Utopia, an alternative space of nearly two years' duration that the artist Austin Thomas oversaw in a Bushwick, Brooklyn, storefront until this spring. 
 More ambitious examples of proactivity include ''Prospect.1 New Orleans,'' the new bootstrap international biennial willed into existence by the independent curator Dan Cameron last fall, and this summer's ''Plot/09: This World & Nearer Ones'' (on view through next Sunday), which inaugurated an international survey of public art that Creative Time will stage every four years on Governors Island, just off Manhattan's shores. 
 If the Bruce High Quality Foundation University thrives, it could prove an even more valuable addition. Until now the group has been best known for a sharp, well-aimed and unusually entertaining form of institutional critique. In 2005, when a shard of parkland was being pulled around New York Harbor -- the posthumous realization of Robert Smithson's 1970 drawing ''Floating Island to Travel Around Manhattan Island'' -- the members pursued it in a tiny skiff carrying a small model of one of Christo and Jeanne-Claude's orange ''Gates,'' which had filled Central Park earlier in the year. (The title of the Bruce piece, playing off Wallace Stevens, was ''The Gate: Not the Idea of the Thing But the Thing Itself.'')
 In ''Public Sculpture Tackle,'' a continuing work begun in 2007 and documented in video, one of the Bruces hurls himself against, clambers up or hangs from various pieces of public sculpture around Manhattan, all the while outfitted in quasi-Matthew Barney quasi-football gear. The foundation has also made a site-specific film, ''Isle of the Dead,'' that charts the death and zombie-dominated resurrection of the art world and is one of the best works in ''Plot/09.'' 
 These efforts are fine as far as they go, but now the Bruces are trying to add to a tradition of artist-initiated schools like the Art Students League, 134 years old and going strong. The group has cited as inspiration the Summerhill boarding school in Britain, founded by A. S. Neill in the 1920s, where children and teachers have an equal say in all decisions. 
 The Bruces' new direction was indicated last July when four of the group's members gave a lecture-performance called ''Explaining Pictures to a Dead Bull'' at the Harris Lieberman Gallery. The title paid homage to Joseph Beuys's famous performance, ''How to Explain Pictures to a Dead Hare,'' while addressing a post-boom, dead-bull art universe. Although accompanied by a series of amusingly pertinent or impertinent slides, the lecture was entirely serious. It diagrammed the links among contemporary art, the market and the art schools producing M.F.A.'s who are burdened by debt but largely naive about the workings of the art world. It ended with the question: ''How can we imagine a sustainable alternative to professionalized art education?'' 
 Bruce High Quality Foundation University is one such imagining. Whether it becomes ''the thing itself'' remains to be seen, but even as ''the idea of the thing'' it strikes a blow where one is seriously needed, against the big business of art schools. The university's first course, which is meeting weekly, is titled Bring Your Own University (B.Y.O.U.). In other words, all those present will ''design and implement the administrative policy and curriculum.'' Whatever happens, this latest move by the Bruce High Quality Foundation adds inspirational heft to its motto: ''Professional problems. Amateur solutions.''

HEADLINE: The Phone Beckons: Got Game?

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS QUENQUA

 BODY:
FOR Meghan McGuire, a lawyer from Chicago, the uproar over texting while driving hit a nerve. 
 Not that she is guilty of that particular recklessness -- she does not compose text messages at high speeds, she said. But she had been indulging her own mobile obsession. 
 She was playing BrickBreaker, the profoundly unsophisticated ball-and-paddle game bundled with every BlackBerry.
 ''I was only doing it at red lights and when I was stuck in traffic jams,'' Ms. McGuire said. ''After a while I was like, 'Oh, my God, I am crazy.' '' 
 While BrickBreaker may not be a social menace (at least if played while parked), the game is still having its way with a good portion of the obsessive BlackBerry-toting population. ''I used to play before bed and fall asleep imagining the moves I could have made,'' said Ms. McGuire, who hasn't owned a gaming console since the Atari 2600 and cannot tell Grand Theft Auto from Gears of War. 
 ''My boyfriend would get annoyed because I would wake up before him and start playing, and he'd be, like, 'Stop clicking!' ''
 Like Solitaire and Free Cell in the 1990s, BrickBreaker is little more than a giveaway on a popular business device. 
 But as BlackBerrys become more popular -- they account for more than 20 percent of the smart-phone market, according to a 2009 study by Forrester Research -- there are signs BrickBreaker has grown into a global time suck. 
 The first-ever BrickBreaker tournament is being held next month on Long Island (Dina, Ali and Cody Lohan teamed up for the announcement at a news conference in July). On social networking sites, including Twitter, there is a steady stream of often delirious chatter in a variety of languages about the game.
 On Facebook, more than 150 groups are now dedicated to the game, like BrickBreaker Anonymous and You Think I'm Doing Something Important, but I'm Really Playing BrickBreaker.
 Bloggers who have written guides to the game say they are drawing big traffic numbers from all over the world. Carlo Maglinao, author of Techbays, a technology blog, says a series of posts last spring on how to play the game received more than 100,000 views -- by far his most popular posts -- and continue to get more than 500 hits a day.
 The game has long been the secret shame among executives, the original users of the BlackBerry. Joel I. Klein, chancellor of New York City schools, told The New York Times in March that he was a recovering BrickBreaker addict who once scored close to five million points.
 David Spetrino, the chief executive of a construction company in Wilmington, N.C., tells of hiding his BlackBerry from his two young sons so they wouldn't beat his high score. ''The last thing you want is some knucklehead taking out your legacy,'' he said. ''They'll have plenty of time to beat their old man. They're not taking my high score in BrickBreaker.''
 Jeff Peters, an account manager for a major telecommunications company in Houston, uninstalled the game in February after he found himself playing it during sales meetings. ''It just became ridiculous,'' said Mr. Peters (high score: about 600,000). ''I just decided it was enough, and my life has been freer ever since.'' 
 Mitch Weber, an anchor at a Fox TV affiliate in Topeka, Kan., recently tweeted, ''Watching Meagan play 'brick breaker' on her phone for the 100th time.'' 
 He was referring to his co-anchor, Meagan Farley, who, he said, plays the game on set during commercial breaks. 
 And Ian Gomez (high score: 400,000), an actor who appears in the coming series ''Cougar Town'' on ABC and in movies like ''My Big Fat Greek Wedding, '' said he has been caught playing during dinner parties given by his wife, the actress Nia Vardalos. 
 ''I'd be sitting outside the circle of guests, and they'd be like, 'What are you doing over there?' '' he said. ''Meanwhile, I'm thinking, 'Just one more level, and then I'll be a social animal.' '' 
 The game itself hardly seems worthy of obsession. Ian Bogost, a video game researcher and designer at the Georgia Institute of Technology, said in an interview that BrickBreaker is a poor-quality Breakout clone, referring to the 1970s arcade game.
 The player uses the phone's trackball to move a paddle across the bottom of the screen, bouncing a ball into stacks of ''bricks'' that disappear when they are struck. Breaking particular bricks yields powers -- the ability to catch the ball, say, or shoot the bricks -- and each successive board becomes more complex. 
 The application is also notoriously buggy. The ball will occasionally disappear from the screen, or fall through bricks that should be impenetrable. YouTube is filled with videos of angry players providing evidence of high-scoring games abandoned because of such defects. 
 Protesters take to YouTube, perhaps, because it is unclear who created the game: Research in Motion, the company that makes the BlackBerry, does not disclose the names of developers behind applications, and declined to comment for this article. But Plazmic, a content development company that Research in Motion acquired in 2001, holds the copyright. 
 Gaming experts say simplicity is BrickBreaker's most addictive element, the promise that mastery of the next level is never more than 10 to 15 minutes away. 
 ''What you're trying to do with casual games is present the player with something that they immediately sense is both achievable and a challenge,'' said Garth Chouteau, a spokesman with PopCap games, which makes popular online games like Bejeweled and Zuma. ''This is something I can do and obtain some small sense of accomplishment.''
 PopCap, whose site had more than 3.6 million unique visitors in August and whose games have been downloaded more than 10 million times, estimates the casual games market at more than 200 million people; 40 percent of them are white-collar workers, the company says, and 21 percent play on mobile devices.
 That last number, Professor Bogost said, holds the key to why BrickBreaker is an even more pervasive time-waster than Solitaire once was: You don't have to be at your desk to play it. 
 Technology does move on, and BrickBreaker may soon feel as dated as Minesweeper. The newest BlackBerrys come bundled with several other games, providing other diversions. 
 Bill Kelly, a partner in a Manhattan law firm who used to play BrickBreaker to calm his nerves during deliberations, said he has stopped because his new BlackBerry has a poker game that he prefers (and because a nephew deleted his best BrickBreaker game, 1.2 million). 
 Ms. McGuire, the Chicago lawyer, has stopped playing, too. ''After three years of BlackBerrys, I have moved on to an iPhone,'' she wrote in an e-mail message.
 ''My breakup with BrickBreaker was rough, but I am getting more and more used to it everyday,'' she continued. ''Also, I am now a safer driver.''

HEADLINE: Fast-Forwarding Gordon Gekko

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
O.K. Oliver Stone already has a screenplay for ''Wall Street 2,'' the sequel to his culturally resonant 1987 dissection of financial ruthlessness. He has been busy shooting it in Manhattan. If he has second thoughts about the project, he might consider these alternative plotlines: 
 GREED IS STILL GOOD
 Freed from the confines of the federal penitentiary where he has spent the past 22 years serving time for securities fraud, Gordon Gekko is delighted to see that his views on greed have spawned a growth industry. No longer must he endure criticism when he preaches that greed is good; his concept has in fact gained acceptance at the highest reaches of commerce. Even better, the United States government has taken the view that on the rare occasions when greed goes bad, the taxpayer will be there to pick up the tab.
 To be sure, Mr. Gekko is sorry to have missed out on the billions he could have made during the subprime mortgage boom. But he recognizes that his exit from prison is perfectly timed in another way. In the aftermath of the credit bubble, 17,000-square-foot mansions in Greenwich, Conn., go begging, Gulfstream jets can be bought on the cheap and prestigious golf clubs no longer have years-long waiting lists. 
 Because he went to jail for securities fraud and probably agreed to sanctions in the case, Mr. Gekko is barred from working for a financial firm or becoming a registered investment adviser. Still there are other possibilities: starting a hedge fund that accepts only a handful of wealthy and sophisticated clients, for example. Based in the Cayman Islands, the Gekko Insider Insights Fund will almost certainly specialize in high-frequency trading, the investment strategy du jour. Just as certain: investors, eager to hire a manager of such notoriety and business acumen, will throw billions Mr. Gekko's way.

PERSON: Lou Bender 

HEADLINE: Lou Bender, 99, Basketball Pioneer in City

BYLINE: By VINCENT M. MALLOZZI

 BODY:
Lou Bender, an all-American basketball player at Columbia whose stellar play during the Depression helped popularize the game and make Madison Square Garden a magnet for college basketball, died Thursday at his home in Longboat Key, Fla. He was 99. 
 The cause was cancer, his son Steven Bender said. 
 Bender, a 6-foot-1 forward who played at DeWitt Clinton High School in the late 1920s, received the nickname Lulu when he sank a two-handed set shot from long range and a fan shrieked, ''Now that was a lulu of a basket.'' He led Columbia to the 1930 and 1931 Ivy League championships, winning league scoring titles in both of those seasons with averages of 9.8 points and 9.6 points.
 ''I give Lou a lot of credit, because those were the days before the shot clock was invented, so 10 points a game was quite a feat,'' the former St. John's coach Lou Carnesecca said Friday in an interview. ''In those days, if you missed a shot, you might not see the ball again for a month.''
 Bender played professionally throughout the 1930s for the Original Celtics, a barnstorming team from New York that also starred Joe Lapchick, and with the Union City (New Jersey) Reds and Boston Trojans of the American Basketball League, a precursor to the N.B.A. He finished his career with the independent New York Whirlwinds in 1941. He later became a trial lawyer, specializing in the defense of those accused of criminal tax evasion.
 It was during his days at Columbia that Bender played an integral role in the rise in popularity of basketball in New York City, especially at Madison Square Garden. In January 1931, Mayor Jimmy Walker staged a fund-raising tripleheader at the Garden to raise money for unemployment relief. In one game, Manhattan defeated New York University, 16-14. In another, St. John's defeated City College, 17-9, as a record 15,000 fans filled the Garden. In the other game, Columbia defeated Fordham, 26-18, as Bender led all scorers with 8 points. The event raised $22,000. 
 It was a turning point for the sport, and within five years, the Garden was hosting an abundance of well-attended doubleheaders each season, games that included not just local basketball powers, but many other teams from across the country.
 Besides his son Steven, Bender's survivors include his wife, Jean; another son, Michael; two daughters, Ellyn and Golda; and 11 grandchildren. 
 He was inducted into the New York City Basketball Hall of Fame in 2008. 

CORRECTION-DATE: September 16, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An obituary on Sunday about Lou Bender, a Columbia basketball star who helped popularize the game in New York City, misidentified the championships he led Columbia to in 1930 and 1931. They were Eastern Intercollegiate Basketball League championships, not Ivy League titles. (The Eastern Intercollegiate Basketball League was popularly referred to as the Ivy League at the time, but the league was not officially formed until 1954.)

HEADLINE: East Side of Chicago? It's in New York

BYLINE: By CHARLES ISHERWOOD

 BODY:
THE New York theater often seems to speak exclusively in a British accent, so prevalent are London imports on Broadway stages. But this season the distinct flavor of the biggest city in America's Midwest will make itself known, with Chicago-bred playwrights and directors involved in several major productions. Even a pair of big-time international movie stars -- one British and one Australian -- will be wrapping their vocal chords around the flat vowels and colorful argot of a pair of Chicago cops, as Daniel Craig and Hugh Jackman supply the fall season its biggest jolt of star power in ''A Steady Rain,'' a taut two-hander by the new-to-New York playwright Keith Huff that is making the leap from a small Chicago stage to the Main Stem. (See Page 10.) 
 That jump might well become a fairly common feat of theatrical calisthenics. Chicago has long been a great theater town, as any theater lover who has spent time there knows. The city hosts a couple of the country's most esteemed regional companies -- the Goodman and the Steppenwolf -- as well as a good half-dozen other major theaters, along with a collection of golden-age commercial palaces in the Loop. But it is also home to one of the most fertile small-theater economies in the country, a thriving network of tiny storefronts or spaces on the outer fringes of the city that continually feed actors, writers and artists who often graduate to the larger theaters. In some ways the city's small-theater scene is more robust than Off Broadway, overshadowed as that territory often is by the glare of Broadway.
 So it is perhaps not surprising that Chicago-born productions, and Chicago-bred artists, have been making powerful inroads on New York theater in recent years. The biggest bang came from the Steppenwolf, of course, where Tracy Letts's ''August: Osage County'' sprang into brawling life two years ago before moving to Broadway. It became one of the longest-running new plays of the last decade, and in London it played a smash run at the National Theater. The play, which garnered just about every major American theater award along the way, is now on a national tour headlined by Estelle Parsons. 
 This fall Mr. Letts's follow-up to ''August'' arrives on Broadway, once again with the original director, Tina Landau, and cast of the Steppenwolf Theater production on board. ''Superior Donuts,'' which opens Oct. 1 at the Music Box Theater, is not the blood-dripping slab of theatrical meat that ''August'' was. Although an act of violence figures nominally in the plot, ''Superior Donuts'' is lightly dusted with sugar. It's an affectionate, character-based comedy-drama focusing on a neighborhood in transition -- the city's Uptown district -- and the relationships among a handful of men and women who frequent the local doughnut and coffee shop run by an ex-radical of Polish and Russian descent.
 Michael McKean plays this withdrawn but amiable fellow, Arthur Przybyszewski, who strikes up a fatherly friendship with the brash young African-American man he hires to help out. The lively rapport between Mr. McKean's wary Arthur and Jon Michael Hill's ebullient Franco Wicks was among the most memorable pleasures of the Steppenwolf production, which I saw in Chicago last year.
 While ''Superior Donuts'' affords New Yorkers a little bite of Chicago, revivals of Neil Simon's ''Brighton Beach Memoirs'' and ''Broadway Bound'' will give an up-and-coming director from Chicago, David Cromer, a chance to marinate in the pungent atmosphere of Brooklyn angst. The chronological bookends of Mr. Simon's autobiographical trilogy, produced on Broadway in the 1980s, these two plays are seriocomic studies in the emotional dynamics of a middle-class Jewish family as seen through the eyes of the youngest son, Eugene Jerome, the aspiring writer standing in for Mr. Simon. 
 Mr. Cromer is best known to New Yorkers as the director of the hit revival of Thornton Wilder's ''Our Town,'' now on view at the Barrow Street Theater, in which he also starred as the Stage Manager. (He gave up the role to begin rehearsals on the Simon plays.)
 Mr. Cromer's career has largely developed in the Midwest, so he might be seen as a counterintuitive choice for Mr. Simon's quintessentially New York plays, richly stocked as they are in Borscht Belty humor. But he has already proved the breadth of his range, garnering notice both for the stark, Expressionist new musical ''Adding Machine'' (seen Off Broadway in 2008) and finely wrought revivals of William Inge's ''Come Back, Little Sheba'' and ''Picnic,'' as well as ''Our Town,'' where the cosmic meets Main Street in Grover's Corners, N.H.
 Finding his way to Brighton Beach in the years before and after World War II is not a simple matter of hopping on the subway, but Mr. Cromer's talent at drawing nuanced performances from actors bodes well for this theatrical double-header. ''Brighton Beach Memoirs'' opens Oct. 25, with ''Broadway Bound'' following on Dec. 10. Eventually they will alternate in repertory.
 The double-barreled casting of two formidable action-movie stars in ''A Steady Rain'' ensures that Mr. Huff's drama about the job stresses threatening the lifelong friendship of two Chicago-born police officers will be among the fall's hottest tickets when it opens Sept. 29 at the Gerald Schoenfeld Theater. Mr. Huff is a newcomer to New York theater, making his Broadway debut in circumstances that are the envy of all aspiring playwrights. Celebrity allure aside, ''A Steady Rain'' comes from Chicago trailing accolades from the city's top critics and is the work of a writer who has been steadily developing his craft at Chicago Dramatists, where the play had its premiere last year, for more than two decades.
 David Mamet is Chicago's most famous theatrical son, of course, and he will be richly and appropriately represented on Broadway and for that matter Off Broadway in this season full of gusts from the Windy City. First to arrive, by way of an amuse-bouche, will be ''Two Unrelated Plays by David Mamet'' at the Atlantic Theater Company, which Mr. Mamet co-founded and which has been a sturdy shepherd of his catalog. Neil Pepe directs the two plays, ''Keep Your Pantheon'' and ''School,'' in a production starring Brian Murray and John Pankow opening at the Atlantic on Sept. 30. 
 Then comes the Broadway debut of Mr. Mamet's ''Oleanna,'' the 1993 drama about a combative encounter between a female student and her male professor. The new revival, starring Bill Pullman and Julia Stiles and directed by Doug Hughes, opens Oct. 11 at the John Golden Theater. And Mr. Mamet also has a new play coming to Broadway this fall, with the potentially contentious (or not) title ''Race,'' opening Dec. 6 at the Ethel Barrymore Theater. 
 The play's subject matter has been kept under wraps, suggesting the incendiary, or perhaps just to stoke anticipation. On Page 12 an essay by Mr. Mamet reveals that the plot concerns a firm, staffed by black and white lawyers, that takes on a racially sensitive case. David Alan Grier and James Spader star in the production, which marks Mr. Mamet's Broadway directing debut.

HEADLINE: Old Problems Persist Despite New Leadership in Iraq's Anbar Province

BYLINE: By SAM DAGHER

DATELINE: RAMADI, Iraq 

 BODY:
It has been just more than seven months since a mainly tribal coalition came to power here in Anbar Province, but already its leaders are being accused by many of doing little for most citizens while seeking to enrich themselves through sweetheart business deals. 
 ''The majority of them are after personal gains,'' said Sheik Ghazi Sami al-Abed, a prominent local businessman recently. ''Few are looking to rebuild the country.''
 The provincial elections at the end of January were supposed to enfranchise people in this staunchly Sunni Arab province, once a stronghold for insurgents and militants linked to Al Qaeda. After almost all the Anbar Sunni tribes boycotted the previous elections in 2005, this year's voting was seen as a crucial way to bring them into government and perhaps ease tensions with the Shiite-dominated national government in Baghdad.
 But extensive interviews with Anbar residents show that they see very little difference between their new government and the previous provincial council. That council, widely deemed illegitimate by many boycotting Sunnis, was accused so vehemently of corrupt and dysfunctional rule that it created fears of renewed intertribal warfare. 
 ''They are thugs; they became politicians and now they have a lot of money,'' said another Anbar businessman about the province's current political leaders. He spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution.
 The discontent in Anbar is coming at a critical time, as the United States has reduced its military presence here significantly and completely stopped spending money on new projects despite the province's ''enormous'' infrastructure needs, said one senior American official. It was American cash and contracts that spurred most tribal leaders to renounce the insurgency and switch alliances to the American side almost three years ago, in what is now known as the Sunni Awakening -- a model the United States is seeking to replicate with tribes in Afghanistan.
 In the absence of American patronage, the worrisome question in Anbar, which makes up roughly one-third of Iraq's territory, is whether public dissatisfaction coupled with political and economic rivalries between the tribal leaders in power and those on the outside could lead to large-scale violence. 
 ''The structure of modern local governance including transparency and accountability are at variance with the traditional expectations of tribal leaders,'' said James Soriano, who leads the State Department's Provincial Reconstruction Team based on the outskirts of the provincial capital, Ramadi. ''There is a potential for a recipe for trouble if the pie is shrinking.''
 Mr. Soriano spoke before his expected departure from Ramadi this month.
 Anbar's test also comes at a time when insurgents appear to be regrouping. Almost no day goes by without an attack or a bombing in Falluja, the province's other main city. Several pro-American tribal leaders have been killed, and there have been a number of deadly bombings in Ramadi and other cities like Haditha and Qaim since July.
 The picture is further complicated by a still uneasy relationship between this province, once among the most loyal to Saddam Hussein, and the Shiite-led national government. Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki appears to be pitting Sunni leaders against one another and finding tribal allies here who can bolster his standing as a national leader and help him in his bid for re-election in January.
 In addition to money spent by the Americans in Anbar, the previous provincial government received hundreds of millions of dollars from the central government. Much of it is believed to have been lost to corruption and mismanagement. 
 Among the new political leaders coming under increased criticism is the province's governor, Qasim Abed al-Fahadawi. 
 In the absence of new American development aid, dwindling as the United States has urged the government in Baghdad to fill the breach, Mr. Fahadawi has followed the Western model and turned to the private sector for investment and help. The governor was even recognized for his efforts as ''global personality of the year'' by the London-based magazine Foreign Direct Investment.
 But increasingly, the governor's business affiliations are sounding alarm bells inside the province and elsewhere.
 In a recent interview, Mr. Fahadawi made no secret of favoring a small clique of his tribal and business friends over others when it comes to future investments and contracts in the province. His relationship with Sheik Ahmed Abu Risha, who two years ago took the lead role in the American-backed tribal Awakening movement, has caused hard feelings here. 
 Sheik Ahmed has turned the Awakening movement into the dominant political party here, leading the coalition that runs the Anbar provincial council. Many of the two men's opponents say that Mr. Fahadawi has basically served as Sheik Ahmed's money manager, with the two combining forces to use their political power to control how business contracts in Anbar are distributed to outside companies. 
 Both men insist that their business dealings are completely aboveboard, and Mr. Fahadawi says he has helped bring in investment and jobs that have helped revitalize local industries. 
 One of the biggest deals the men have been involved in is an effort to bring in two companies from the United Arab Emirates, Dana Gas and Crescent Petroleum, to develop Anbar's giant Akkaz gas field. Sheik Ahmed has taken the lead in the negotiations, and the two companies have committed to helping create as many as 100,000 jobs in the province, Mr. Fahadawi said.
 But the men are circumventing the Oil Ministry's plan to put the contract up for general bidding, instead appealing directly to Mr. Maliki for support. It was one of the main topics Sheik Ahmed and Mr. Maliki discussed when the prime minister visited Anbar this summer. Almost 175 sheep were slaughtered and the meat was distributed in Mr. Maliki's honor, according to local residents.
 Opposing tribal leaders in Anbar see the deal as an attempt by Sheik Ahmed to use national backing to cement his position as the province's de facto chieftain and to freeze them out of lucrative business interests. They say he already has a dangerous amount of control over the local government and security forces.
 ''There will be a bloody struggle if he takes it all,'' warned Sheik Ghazi, the prominent local businessman.
 Another Anbar business magnate, Sheik Tariq Khalaf al-Abdullah, who was instrumental in introducing American forces to the local power structure at the beginning of the Awakening movement, also is fighting the deal. Sheik Tariq is now based in Amman, Jordan, but he has been trying to galvanize the opposition within Anbar.
 In an interview in his plush office in Amman, he wondered why the Americans were not taking a bigger role in monitoring Anbar's affairs. ''I am surprised how they could withdraw before tying the loose ends,'' he said.
 Sheik Tariq established a tribal council and businesses for Anbar's sheiks that benefited from American money and largesse when it was more abundant in return for allegiance.
 Mr. Soriano, the leader of the State Department reconstruction team, said that the United States would continue to assist and advise Anbar's government but that it would be up to Iraqis to resolve their differences and determine their priorities.
 ''A nice way to exit Iraq would be for a tribal society to support the structure of local government and local security forces to prevent a setback,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Congress Can't Rely On Public Opinion

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
A House member shouts that the president is a liar during a nationally televised address to Congress. A senator admits to money changing hands after an affair with the wife of a top aide. The chairman of the tax committee fails to disclose significant assets and income.
 No wonder the public holds Congress in such low esteem. Then again, the public usually holds Congress in low esteem. 
 While the current messy fight over health care -- epitomized by Representative Joe Wilson's outburst -- is helping hold down public approval of Congress at the moment, the fact is that Americans, at least as reflected in polls and other studies, typically see the institution in a relatively poor light. 
 It is the moments when Congress is embraced by the citizenry that are rare. For instance, appreciation for Congress soared in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terror attacks before it quickly began a steady slide back down.
 ''Generally, Congress is not held in high regard,'' said Brendan Daly, the spokesman for Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker.
 Contempt for Congress is practically an American tradition, making the current lackluster standing of the House and Senate about standard despite the passions surrounding the health care fight as well as several missteps by high-profile individuals that help make Congress look bad. 
 Besides the furor over the Wilson episode, the Senate has had to deal with the case of Senator John Ensign of Nevada who had to quit the Republican leadership after acknowledging a long affair and payments to the family of the woman. And Representative Charles B. Rangel, the New York Democrat who heads the House tax committee, has acknowledged owing back taxes on some earnings and recently revised his financial disclosure statements to add significant assets he had not previously listed. There are other lawmakers under scrutiny as well.
 Gallup has been tracking Congressional approval since 1974, and its most recent finding of 31 percent approval is in the neighborhood of the historical average of 35 percent. The most recent CBS News poll finding of 26 percent approval was roughly double the low point registered last fall. 
 The Pew Research Center for the People and the Press had its approval rating for Congress at a 24-year low late last month (37 percent), but it was not all that far off the beginning of this year or the previous year.
 That is not to say that Congress is doing well; it is just doing about as badly as usual.
 John R. Hibbing, a political science professor at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, has extensively studied public sentiment about Congress and other political institutions and has come to what some might consider surprising conclusions.
 First, Mr. Hibbing said his research suggests that economic conditions do not greatly determine the overall public view of Congress, which is probably good news for legislators given the current struggles. And in another finding, he said the misdeeds of individual lawmakers are typically not dominant factors in determining public perceptions.
 ''We didn't see any clear indication that a single scandal, however salient, dramatically drove down the public esteem of the institution,'' he said, though legislators might not be comforted by his reasoning. ''I think people have come to the judgment they are a bunch of scallywags.''
 So what does tend to sully the public image of Congress? ''When Congress is in the news a lot, it tends to be less popular,'' Mr. Hibbing said.
 That is a potential problem for the modern-day Congress on multiple levels. First, with 24-hour cable television coverage and the growth of the Internet, stories are replayed throughout the day accompanied by endless commentary and criticism. 
 Just take the case of Mr. Wilson, the Republican back-bencher from South Carolina who went from obscurity to household figure in the course of two words -- ''You lie!'' -- and in a matter of hours.
 Second, and perhaps more important, Congress is often in the news when it is trying to get something big done. Moving major legislation is a contentious process, a serious struggle between competing points of view and interests with a lot of sharp elbows, sharp words and even occasional shouts from the floor.
 When trying to deal with the type of issues that Congress is now confronting -- from health care to economic collapse to global climate change -- the going is naturally going to get rough, meaning Congress should not count on seeing its stock rise soon.
 The issue for majority Democrats as they try to protect their numbers in the 2010 elections is whether they can raise Congressional standing at just the right time to stave off the losses that typically hit the party controlling the White House in a mid-term election. They are banking on enacting a health care law and other major legislation as a way to demonstrate that they can deliver on their promises.
 To Republicans, the blame for the current unpopularity of Congress naturally lies with the Democrats. The question will be whether the Republicans can capitalize on low Congressional standing in the coming months to cut into Democratic numbers in the House and Senate next year without sacrificing too many of their own incumbents to public disregard.
 As for Congress over all, Mr. Hibbing suggests it might be the victim of unrealistic public expectations based on an idealized image of lawmakers working harmoniously together to solve the nation's problems when reality is a lot more gritty. 
 ''We may be setting up politicians and Congress for a fall by giving people a sense this is still a pristine operation,'' he said.
 Perhaps the civics books need a rewrite.

HEADLINE: Where Politics Don't Belong

BYLINE: By TYLER COWEN. 
Tyler Cowen is a professor of economics at George Mason University.

 BODY:
 FOR years now, many businesses and individuals in the United States have been relying on the power of government, rather than competition in the marketplace, to increase their wealth. This is politicization of the economy. It made the financial crisis much worse, and the trend is accelerating.
 Well before the financial crisis erupted, policy makers treated homeowners as a protected political class and gave mortgage-backed securities privileged regulatory treatment. Furthermore, they allowed and encouraged high leverage and the expectation of bailouts for creditors, which had been practiced numerous times, including the precedent of Long-Term Capital Management in 1998. Without these mistakes, the economy would not have been so invested in leverage and real estate and the financial crisis would have been much milder. 
 But we are now injecting politics ever more deeply into the American economy, whether it be in finance or in sectors like health care. Not only have we failed to learn from our mistakes, but also we're repeating them on an ever-larger scale.
 Lately the surviving major banks have reported brisk profits, yet in large part this reflects astute politicking and lobbying rather than commercial skill. Much of the competition was cleaned out by bank failures and consolidation, so giants like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan had an easier time getting back to profits. The Federal Reserve has been lending to banks at near-zero interest rates while paying higher interest on the reserves the banks hold at the Fed. ''Too big to fail'' policies mean that the large banks can raise money more cheaply because everyone knows they are safe counterparties. 
 President Dwight D. Eisenhower warned of the birth of a military-industrial complex. Today we have a financial-regulatory complex, and it has meant a consolidation of power and privilege. We've created a class of politically protected ''too big to fail'' institutions, and the current proposals for regulatory reform further cement this notion. Even more worrying, with so many explicit and implicit financial guarantees, we are courting a bigger financial crisis the next time something major goes wrong. 
 We should stop using political favors as a means of managing an economic sector. Unfortunately, though, recent experience with health care reform shows we are moving in the opposite direction and not heeding the basic lessons of the financial crisis. Finance and health care are two separate issues, of course, but in both cases we're making the common mistake of digging in durable political protections for special interest groups.
 One disturbing portent came over the summer when it was reported that the Obama administration had promised deals to doctors and to pharmaceutical companies under the condition that they publicly support health care reform. That's another example of creating favored beneficiaries through politics. 
 If these initial deals are falling apart, it is only because reform met with unexpected resistance. Even after Mr. Obama's speech Wednesday night, we're still at the point where the medical sector is enshrined as ''too big to take a pay cut,'' which is not so far removed from the banking motto of ''too big to fail.'' In finance and health care, a common political dynamic has created similar trends, namely, out-of-control costs, weak accountability, and the use of immediate revenue patches to postpone dealing with fundamental problems. 
 Even worse, these political deals threaten open discourse. The dealmaking may be inhibiting some people in health care from speaking out in opposition to the administration's proposals. Robert Reich, who served as secretary of labor in the Clinton administration, deserves credit for complaining about this arrangement, but not enough people are asking where such dealmaking might stop. 
 The banking sector has been facing similar constraints; if bankers criticize the Treasury or the Fed, they risk losing their gilded cages and could get a bad deal when the next bailout comes. When major economic sectors can be influenced in this way, are we really very far from the nightmare depicted by Ayn Rand in ''Atlas Shrugged''?
 So if we're looking for a major lesson from our banking mess, it is undoubtedly this: We have made a grave mistake in politicizing the economy so deeply, and should back away now. In health care, the Obama administration should drop its medical sector deals and try to sell a reform plan -- in whatever form Mr. Obama chooses -- on its own merits. That's not only good for health care, but also good for the American polity. And in the longer run, that will be good for banking, too. If nothing else, without controlling health care costs, the American government will not stay solvent -- and that will be the biggest financial crisis of them all.
 In short, we should return both the financial and medical sectors and, indeed, our entire economy to greater market discipline. We should move away from the general attitude of ''too big to take a pay cut,'' especially when the taxpayer is on the hook for the bill. If such changes sound daunting, it is a sign of how deep we have dug ourselves in. We haven't yet learned from the banking crisis, and we're still moving in the wrong direction pretty much across the board.

HEADLINE: Where the Players Landed

 BODY:
One year after the worst week of the financial crisis, some of the most famous names on Wall Street are still looking for jobs or fighting lawsuits.
 Richard S. Fuld Jr.
 THEN As the long-time chief executive of Lehman Brothers, he made a big push to diversify the firm's business mix. By 2007, it had accumulated a significant portfolio of risky real estate. When the credit crisis hit, the government refused to extend to Lehman the same aid it would later offer to other banks, like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. Lehman declared bankruptcy on Sept. 15, 2008. 
 NOW Many of his friends told him to sit it out and let the storm pass. Others told him to get back in and fight. He took the latter's advice and last spring founded a corporate advising firm, Matrix Advisors, where he has a staff of three: his two assistants from Lehman and a junior associate. 
 Friends and former colleagues say he has been ''devastated'' by Lehman's failure. He and other former senior executives of the firm are the target of numerous lawsuits that claim they misled investors about its financial condition. He has denied the allegations 
 During downtime, he commutes to vacation homes in Florida and Idaho. Friends say he plays golf and likes to hike up the mountain behind his house in Idaho. 
 Erin Callan
 THEN She came to be seen as the public face of Lehman Brothers from December 2007 to June 2008 at a time of increasing doubt over its financial health. She was forced from her post as chief financial officer in 2008 in an effort by senior management to reverse the firm's fortunes.
 NOW In July, 2008, she joined Credit Suisse to work with the firm's hedge fund clients. But in February she left her post and took a personal leave of absence. It is unclear when or if she will return. She is named in the lawsuits against former senior executives of Lehman.
 E. Stanley O'Neal
 THEN He was ousted as the chief executive of Merrill Lynch in 2007 after the firm built up a big portfolio of troubled mortgages.
 NOW He now serves as a director on several boards, including Alcoa and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. He and his wife are ''active supporters'' of Bronx Preparatory, a charter school, according to his spokesman.
 According to his friends, Mr. O'Neal puts a high priority on his workouts. He plays squash with his son at the New York Athletic Club and golfs in Purchase, N.Y., as well as on Martha's Vineyard, where he owns a waterfront home. 
 John Thain
 THEN He was appointed chief executive of Merrill Lynch at the end of 2007, and led the company for only 10 months before selling it to Bank of America. He left Bank of America in January amid controversy about his lavish office decorations and the bonuses he paid out just before the merger closed. 
 NOW He is in discussions with several private companies about taking a board seat with a managerial role, his spokesman said. This summer, his son was married at the family estate in Rye, N.Y. Mr. Thain invited friends from Goldman Sachs and the New York Stock Exchange, but several of his former colleagues from Merrill were not invited. 
 Christopher Cox
 THEN As chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, he said his duty was to remain calm during the crisis. Critics say the S.E.C. missed signs of growing problems at brokerage firms while others say it is unfair to heap blame on Mr. Cox. 
 NOW He has returned to his California roots and joined the Costa Mesa office of a Boston-based law firm, Bingham McCutchen. For 17 years in Congress, Mr. Cox represented portions of Orange County. He began his new job on Sept. 1, and will advise clients on government relations and regulations. He will also work in the firm's Washington office for its homeland security group. 
 Robert E. Rubin
 THEN An influential adviser to Citigroup's leadership team and board, he advocated taking more risk. But Citigroup's bad trading bets caused the bank to nearly collapse. 
 NOW In January 2009, he announced he was leaving Citigroup on the same day news leaked that regulators had effectively forced a breakup of the bank. He has kept a lower profile in Washington since President Obama was elected, though he remains close to many senior White House and Treasury Department officials. He is co-chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations. 
 Charles O. Prince III
 THEN He resigned from Citigroup in November 2007 shortly after the bank announced the first of more than $28 billion in losses over the last two years. Citigroup's board handed him about a $12 million bonus on his way out the door. 
 NOW He put his Greenwich, Conn., home on the market and spends much of his time in Palm Beach, Fla. (C. Michael Armstrong, the former head of Citigroup's audit and risk committee, is a golfing buddy there.) Since last fall, he has been dispensing global business and investment advice at Albright Stonebridge, a Washington consulting firm. Mr. Prince and his longtime boss, Sanford I. Weill, have not spoken in more than a year. 
 Angelo R. Mozilo
 THEN From humble beginnings as a butcher's son from the Bronx, he built Countrywide Financial into the largest mortgage lender in the nation. But dubious lending practices created crippling losses at the company, and in early 2008 Countrywide was taken over by Bank of America for $4 billion in stock. Mr. Mozilo, the co-founder and chief executive, left the company as a result of the transaction. 
 NOW He is devoting much of his time to mounting a legal defense against shareholder lawsuits that accused him of profiting from the disaster. In June, Mr. Mozilo was sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission for insider trading and securities fraud. Citing e-mail messages in which Mr. Mozilo referred to types of Countrywide loans as ''toxic'' and ''poison,'' the government contended that he had misled investors about growing risks in the company's lending practices from 2005 through 2007. A lawyer for Mr. Mozilo said he would vigorously defend himself. 
 Joseph J. Cassano
 THEN As head of the financial products unit at the American International Group, he was little-known in the insurance world. But he gained notoriety in 2008 when derivatives bets his group had made on subprime mortgages went south, resulting in calls for collateral from A.I.G.'s customers that the company could not meet. Mr. Cassano resigned from A.I.G. in February 2008 and by mid-September, the customers' cash calls had pushed the company to the brink. The United States government stepped in on Sept. 16 to rescue it.
 NOW He is keeping a low profile as he defends himself against shareholder lawsuits that accuse him of enriching himself while putting A.I.G. at peril with his derivatives bets.
 Neel T. Kashkari
 THEN His formal title was interim assistant secretary of the Treasury for financial stability, but Mr. Kashkari was better known as Treasury's $700 billion man. He helped shape the bailout and headed the office that was created to buy troubled securities. ''It felt like we were at war, and doing everything just to survive,'' he recalls.
 NOW Since last May, he and his wife, Minal, have been enjoying a break at their cabin in Truckee, Calif., near Lake Tahoe. He spends his time reading, bicycling and trying to shed the 20 pounds he put on during the crisis. (He's got five more to go.) The two even competed in the local chili cook-off. He will begin looking for a financial services job this fall. 
 Nouriel Roubini
 THEN Early last year, Mr. Roubini, a professor at New York University's Stern School of Business, was a relatively obscure academic who was making predictions few people believed: financial catastrophe, including a number of large institutions going bust within a couple years. 
 NOW He is celebrated as The Man WhoWas Right and has become a prominent -- and listened to -- voice in the public debate on economic policy. ''I was too optimistic,'' he says now. ''It took seven months for Wall Street as we know it to disappear.'' On the economy, he thinks the end to the global recession is close, though it is not here yet. ''The most important question now is the shape of the recovery -- whether it is rapid and V-shaped or more anemic.'' The latter, he said, ''is the argument I am making.'' 
 Zoe Cruz
 THEN She was a high-flying co-president of Morgan Stanley and the most senior woman on Wall Street. But in November 2007, she was ousted in a shakeup as the firm posted billions in mortgage-related losses.
 NOW After considering a number of options, Ms. Cruz has decided to stay in New York where her family is -- she is married to a senior executive at Credit Suisse -- and return to investment management, the side of the industry she knows best.

HEADLINE: Bending the Curve

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

 BODY:
Taking on the issue of the cost of health care, a Washington Post editorialist intoned recently that ''knowing more about which treatments are effective is essential'' -- knowing about when to use a plural verb is tough, too -- ''but, without a mechanism to put that knowledge into action, it won't be enough to bend the cost curve.'' 
 That curvature continued in The Chicago Tribune, which put the fast-blooming metaphor in a headline: ''Bending the Curve on Health Spending.'' It leaps boundaries beyond costs and subjects: a book has been titled ''Bending the Curve: Your Guide to Tackling Climate Change in South Africa.'' 
 Why has curve-bending become such a popular sport? Because the language is in the grip of graphs. The graphic arts are on the march as ''showing'' tramples on ''explaining,'' and now we are afflicted with the symbols of symbols. As an old Chinese philosopher never said, ''Words about graphs are worth a thousand pictures.'' 
 The first straight-line challenge to the muscular line-benders I could find was in the 1960s, when the power curve was first explained to me by a pilot. ''Being behind or 'on the backside of the power curve' is an aviation expression,'' rooted in World War I, he maintained. ''It's a condition when flying slow takes more energy than going fast, and you produce a result opposite to what you intended.'' On the graph of the power that a plane needs to overcome wind resistance, most ''drag'' increases as a plane slows; that's why you hear a fresh surge of power when a jet is landing. Pilots know that being ''behind the power curve'' is to be on the way to a crash. That image was snapped up in political lingo, when ''to be behind that power curve'' quickly came to mean ''to be out of the loop, trailing the with-it crowd, doomed to be left behind the barn door when the goodies were being handed out.''
 Now we have President Obama, no slouch at seizing on popular figures of speech, warning Fred Hiatt of The Washington Post that ''it's important for us to bend the cost curve, separate and apart from coverage issues, just because the system we have right now is unsustainable and hugely inefficient and uncompetitive.'' In other words, as the bygone aviators knew -- bend it or crash. That led to the Nation's headline ''Bend It Like Obama,'' a play on the movie title ''Bend It Like Beckham.''
 Came the current recession, the graphic-metaphor crowd stopped worrying about a cost line bending inexorably upward and directed its attention to the need to get the upward-bending unemployment figures bending down. Thus, the meaning of the phrase bending the curve is switching from ''bend that awful, upward-curving line down before we can't afford an aspirin'' to ''bend that line up down quick, before we all head for the bread line!'' This leads to metaphoric confusion. It's what happens when you fall in love with full-color graphs to explain to the screen-entranced set what's happening and scorn plain words.
 I am not the only one who observes this in medium-high dudgeon. ''Optics'' is hot, rivaling content. ''It seems that politicians are now working to ensure that their policy positions are stated in a way that's 'optically acceptable' to their constituents,'' writes Tom Short of San Rafael, Calif. ''Not good. Anytime I hear this word used in any context outside of graphic arts, my eye doctor's office or the field of astronomy, my B.S. detector goes into high alert.''
 Symbols are fine; we live by words, figures, pictures. But as Alfred Korzybski postulated seven decades ago, the symbol is not the thing itself: you cannot milk the word ''cow,'' and as he put it, ''a map is not the territory.'' Arthur Laffer's famous curve drawn on a cocktail napkin offers some economists a nice shorthand guide to his supply-side idea, but it is not the theory itself. Today's mind-bending surge toward the use of words about graphs and poll trends -- even when presented in color on elaborate PowerPoint presentations -- takes us steps away from reality. There must be a curve to illustrate that, and I say bend it way back.
 DEPARTMENT OF AMPLIFICATION
 To a recent exploration of the origin of real estate's location, location, location, there have been these useful additions from readers: David K. Barnhart of the lexicographical family writes: ''It reminds me of the book collector's eccentric way of insisting that bindings must be in not less than pristine shape. Our adage is condition, condition, condition.''
 Joe Asher of Seattle adds the three things that matter in public speaking: ''locution, locution, locution.''
 And a fishhook on this page daring to suggest that Abe Lincoln deliberately adopted the ''mistakes were made'' passive voice to avoid taking personal responsibility drew this amplification from Frank Myers, distinguished professor at Stony Brook University in New York: ''Lincoln's Second Inaugural Address contains (by my count) six uses of the passive voice in his first seven sentences, tending to obscure the subject -- especially himself as speaker and actor. No doubt this is part of the artistry of the speech.'' Nobody's perfect.
 Finally, word from the geezersphere, pioneering Comic Strip Division: ''Your citation of Nov shmoz ka pop revitalized nostalgic memories,'' writes Albert Varon of Chicago earnestly if redundantly. ''My recollection is that the comic strip was called 'The Squirrel Cage' and that the ride-thumbing little guy was half-buried in snow next to a barber pole and was dressed in a full tunic or robe and some kind of turban.'' He adds proudly -- and usefully to later generations -- ''For many years, I have announced 'Nov shmoz ka pop!' assertively and dismissively to put off phone solicitors and aggressive panhandlers. Thank you for refreshing those halcyon days of my youth.''

HEADLINE: Labor Leader Is Stepping Down Both Proud and Frustrated

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
After 14 years at labor's helm, John J. Sweeney will step down from his post this week, having failed to achieve his No. 1 goal: significantly expanding labor's ranks.
 Mr. Sweeney, however, the Bronx-born son of a bus driver and a housekeeper, can boast of another achievement: as president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., he transformed labor into a political powerhouse that helped elect President Obama and many other Democrats.
 Not surprisingly, after eight years out in the cold under President George W. Bush, Mr. Sweeney and labor are now eager for Mr. Obama and Congressional Democrats to show their gratitude by enacting some major union-friendly legislation. But so far, Congress has not delivered.
 Mr. Sweeney, 75, said he was holding out hope that Mr. Obama would push through a health care overhaul as well as legislation that would make it considerably easier to unionize. Both bills have been slowed by intense Republican opposition and hesitation among moderate Democrats. 
 ''We realize this is a historic time, and we have to get the health care reform now,'' he said. ''We can't wait another 10 years.''
 He said Mr. Obama had told him and other labor leaders that the momentum created when health care legislation passes would build momentum for the pro-union legislation.
 Mr. Sweeney's longtime No. 2, Richard L. Trumka, is set to be elected president Wednesday at the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s convention in Pittsburgh, a day after Mr. Obama speaks there. Mr. Trumka is running unopposed.
 In a lengthy interview, Mr. Sweeney made it clear that he was stepping down filled with both pride and frustration. 
 He insisted that he had embraced the right strategies to turn things around for labor: prodding individual unions to spend more on organizing workers; creating alliances with the clergy, students and civil rights groups; and championing the cause of low-wage workers. 
 When he won the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s presidency in 1995, he said that on his watch the union movement would organize millions of workers in a surge of unionization like that in the 1930s. In fact, union membership declined by 170,000 during his watch, to 16.1 million, although it rose somewhat the past two years. 
 In discussing what went wrong, Mr. Sweeney sounded as if the world had often conspired against him -- and all of labor.
 Sitting in his conference room, which looks across Lafayette Park to the White House, he said, ''We had eight years of an antiworker administration,'' a comment on the years under Mr. Bush. ''We had some very bad trade policies, and that drastically affected manufacturing industries,'' long the heart of labor. 
 For instance, the United Automobile Workers was so hurt by Detroit's woes that its membership has dwindled to under 500,000 from 1.5 million in 1979.
 ''Based on the optimism that supporters of the labor movement felt in 1995 when he was elected, I think it's hard not to be disappointed with the results,'' said Richard W. Hurd, a professor of labor relations at Cornell University. ''How much of that you can trace back to John Sweeney is a whole other question.''
 Many unions ignored his pleas to intensify organizing efforts. Corporations mounted expensive, sophisticated campaigns to beat back unionization drives. The number of manufacturing workers has plunged nearly one-third, falling by 5.5 million, this decade.
 Professor Hurd said Mr. Sweeney had been gaining momentum during President Bill Clinton's second term. ''The narrow defeat of Al Gore in the 2000 election was incredibly disappointing to labor because, until then, labor was moving in a positive direction,'' he said. ''Starting with the Bush presidency, the environment shifted dramatically, and it became very difficult for unions.''
 Randel K. Johnson, senior vice president for labor at the United States Chamber of Commerce, said Mr. Sweeney was too quick to blame corporations for labor's troubles. ''He continues to have an out-of-date message,'' Mr. Johnson said, ''while demonizing employers inaccurately.''
 The current economic downturn has meant layoffs for many union members and reduced ranks for many unions. Mr. Sweeney said, ''I think the recession is going to drive people to the conclusion that they can't resolve their problems by themselves and they have to look to organizing.''
 He draws a lesson from his childhood. ''Because of the union, my father got things like vacation days or a raise in wages,'' he said. ''But my mother, who worked as a domestic, had nobody. It taught me from a young age the difference between workers who are organized and workers who were by themselves.''
 Charles B. Craver, a professor of labor law at George Washington University, said Mr. Sweeney's vision was too locked in the past. ''They continue using blue-collar techniques to organize 21st-century workers,'' he said. 
 Many workers are eager to have a collective voice at work, Professor Craver said, even though they balk at being associated with anything called a union.
 Mr. Sweeney said one of his most important strategies had been reaching out to workers, many of them immigrants, not typically allied with unions -- day laborers, taxi drivers and car wash workers. 
 Indeed, a major part of his legacy is having shifted labor's stance toward immigrants from an antagonistic one that viewed immigrants as stealing union members' jobs and lowering their wages to a sympathetic one that viewed immigrants as workers whom employers often preyed upon, pulling down labor standards for other workers. 
 Under Mr. Sweeney, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. reversed itself and supported legislation that would give citizenship to illegal immigrants.
 Mr. Sweeney originally promised to serve at most 10 years as president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., a federation of 56 unions representing about nine million workers. But in 2005, several union presidents urged him to serve another four-year term, viewing him as the best person to stabilize labor when several major unions quit the A.F.L.-C.I.O.
 At the time, some officials said labor would benefit from having a more charismatic leader, better at wooing young workers.
 Mr. Trumka, 61, the former president of the United Mine Workers, shares Mr. Sweeney's dream of reviving labor. He is a more dynamic speaker and is more confrontational and impatient than Mr. Sweeney.
 Mr. Trumka, raising the same high hopes that Mr. Sweeney once did, will face many of the same problems: jobs moving overseas, continuing corporate hostility and the indifference that many young and white-collar workers feel toward unions.
 Still, Mr. Sweeney said he had done many things to pave the way for a turnaround under Mr. Trumka, like helping elect a Democratic president, getting more unions to focus on organizing and pushing for legislation that would make it easier to unionize.
 Mr. Sweeney declined to discuss any errors he had made.
 ''Everybody makes mistakes,'' he said. ''There's always room for improvement. I'm very satisfied with what I accomplished.''

HEADLINE: An Overdog To Root For

BYLINE: By JON PARELES

 BODY:
ON July 31 the rapper Jay-Z stood center stage at the All Points West festival in Jersey City, a gig he had taken just eight days earlier when the original headliner, the Beastie Boys, had to drop out because a member needed surgery. No problem: despite a flurry of last-minute recording sessions, deal making and promotion for his new album, ''The Blueprint 3,'' Jay-Z could wedge one more show into his schedule. He brought his full band that has barnstormed across arenas and European festivals, and even added a Beastie Boys song to his set. Thousands of voices shouted in unison on one of his taglines: ''I'm not a businessman -- I'm a business, man!'' 
 In his songs Jay-Z has singlemindedly flaunted his executive ambitions and how they've paid off. He had enough clout to schedule the release of ''The Blueprint 3'' not on a Tuesday, when albums are usually released, but on Friday, Sept. 11, the eighth anniversary of the release of his first ''Blueprint.'' Then he moved it up to Tuesday, reportedly because of online leaks -- although he authorized free, full-album online previews via the Rhapsody subscription service and MTV.com's ''The Leak.'' Jay-Z called himself ''the most bootlegged artist in history,'' which might surprise Bob Dylan or the Grateful Dead. (The new Tuesday release also allows three more days of sales to report to the album charts.) 
 On ''The Blueprint 3'' Jay-Z confronts anew what it is to be a mature rapper: rich, famous, respected, pushing 40. On his 2007 album, ''American Gangster,'' he slipped in and out of an alter ego -- the drug dealer Frank Lucas -- for some street-level action. But with ''What We Talkin' About,'' the opening song on ''The Blueprint 3,'' he rejects ''fiction'' to promise ''fact'': no fantasies this time. His worst problems in the new songs are envious rivals and naysayers, and the self-imposed pressure to keep moving ''On to the Next One'' (although that song insists it comes naturally).
 To keep things interesting Jay-Z applies all his craftsmanship -- wordplay, allusions to his well-documented life, a new verbal cadence for every song -- until, in the best songs, a listener ends up rooting for this overdog. It's an uneven album, with a few too many plush, self-satisfied productions, but when Jay-Z is goaded by the right beat, it's clear how he earned his arrogance.
 Throughout ''Blueprint 3'' he cites his expensive cars, his TriBeCa loft, his place on the Forbes.com Celebrity 100 list of highest-paid entertainers (though he ranks well below his wife, Beyonce) and his role -- ''a small part'' -- in helping elect President Obama. But all the business, Jay-Z insists, is just a means to an end: making music and keeping hip-hop vital. That's right: After a decade of bragging about his entrepreneurial prowess and its material rewards, Jay-Z insists they are beside the point.
 ''I like music,'' he said in an interview at his Chelsea studio, Roc the Mic. ''I can do without business. I think all artists should be paid for their work, but business is business. It's like a necessary part of it for me, more so than something I enjoy.'' He added, ''I want to be remembered as an artist first, but it's not up to me.''
 At 39, Jay-Z is hip-hop's reigning anomaly: a grown-up, level-headed, career-minded adult who has stayed at the top of the charts. His songs have told and retold the poverty-to-bling story of Shawn Carter, Jay-Z's real name, who grew up in the tough Marcy Houses in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, and dealt drugs before turning to hip-hop. By the time his first album came out, he said, ''I was the oldest 26-year-old you ever wanted to meet.'' Then, all his boasts came true. In ''So Ambitious'' on the new album, he raps, ''I went from pauper to the president/'Cause every deal I ever made set precedent.''
 Most rappers would be lucky to have an album or two in the Top 10 before being supplanted by younger, brasher competition. Yet Jay-Z reached the top and has remained there since he released his debut album, ''Reasonable Doubt,'' in 1996. That album, and the nine solo albums that have followed it, have all sold at least a million copies in the United States.
 On ''The Blueprint 3'' he mentions more than once that he has had 10 No. 1 albums: ''Maybe now 11,'' he adds in a track called ''Thank You.'' (Actually he has had eight No. 1 albums on his own: every Jay-Z album since 1998. The other two were collaborations with R. Kelly and Linkin Park.)
 From 2004 to 2007 Jay-Z was the president of Def Jam Recordings, which had been releasing his albums since 1997. He put in regular office hours and signed acts including Rihanna, who joins Jay-Z and his past and current producer Kanye West in ''Run This Town'' on ''The Blueprint 3.''
 Working at a major label, ''I learned that every day you have to remind yourself why you got into this in the first place,'' he said. ''If you lose that passion and fire, then you start doing things by the book.''
 Last year, as his own contract with Def Jam neared its end, he faced the new economic conditions of pop -- dwindling album sales that make performing and licensing more reliable sources of income -- and stepped outside the established recording companies. He made a 10-year, $150 million deal with the concert promoter Live Nation encompassing his albums, tours, publishing and endorsements while financing his own recording company and management firm, Roc Nation; its releases will be manufactured and distributed, but not owned, by Atlantic Records and then by Sony.
 ''I don't get dropped, I drop the label,'' he raps on the new album.
 He now calls the old record companies ''archaic,'' and says they made a huge error in 2000 when they sued to stop the original Napster, which popularized free file sharing: ''They had it all in one place coming through one hole, where they could control it. They shut that down, and just opened the floodgates. Now everyone's running their own Napster. Now it's just a hole in the universe, and it's too late.''
 The tailspin of the record labels, he said, is ''the music business purging itself'' of acts that rely more on promotion than talent. Now, he continued, shrunken labels can't afford the hype: ''You have to find the genuine article and you have to put the genuine music on and that's the only thing that works. That's going to work forever.''
 ''The Blueprint 3'' mixes its boasts with manifestos about the state of hip-hop, which ''saved my life,'' he said. ''When someone does something for you, it's only right that you repay that tenfold, and that was what hip-hop did for me. How could I not protect that or leave it in a good place for the next generation of artists?''
 Jay-Z turns 40 in December, and he's well aware that hip-hop usually has younger demographics. ''The reason that you turn off the hip-hop as you mature is because there's not enough of what you're going through in your life currently,'' he said. ''There's not a lot of people who have come of age in rap because it's only 30 years old. As more people come of age, hopefully the topics get broader and then the audience will stay around longer.
 ''But it's so much viewed as a young person's sport right now at this present moment that it's very difficult. You want to get on the radio, and you've got to make a jingle that's catchy, that sounds like everything else that's on the radio.'' He laughed. ''Not me, the other guy.''
 For the album's first single, he pointedly chose ''D.O.A. (Death of Auto-Tune),'' which ridicules the robotic, computer-tuned hip-hop aimed for pop radio play and ring tone sales. The track's producer, No I.D., said by telephone from Atlanta that Jay-Z wrote the lyrics overnight while working with No I.D. and Kanye West. ''We were having a debate about the direction sonically of the album,'' No I.D. said. Someone joked that Jay-Z needed to write a song to compete with Soulja Boy Tellem, who reached No. 1 with ''Crank That,'' a novelty dance hit. ''I saw his facial expression,'' No I.D. said. ''The next morning it was done.''
 ''D.O.A.'' starts with a dissonant saxophone and a psychedelic guitar. ''It doesn't have a hook,'' Jay-Z said happily. ''But it was the right thing to do at the right time, and it felt good. And then the question happens: What are you doing it for anyway? 
 ''Are you doing it to make a No. 1 record, or are you doing it to invoke conversation, to make art, to push the culture? That's way more important than a No. 1 record.'' 
 He continued: ''It was a point in time when people had to discuss, where are we going now? Are we going to continue down this path or are we not?''
 ''Blueprint 3'' relies largely on hip-hop's name-brand producers. Most of the songs are from Mr. West, who supplies lush, string-laden, fanfaring tracks; there are also productions by Timbaland, including an austere, ominous, electronic battle-of-the-sexes rap called ''Venus vs. Mars,'' and snappy, invigorating tracks from Swizz Beatz, Shux and the Inkredibles. Jay-Z has guests including Alicia Keys and young hip-hop hit makers like Drake, Kid Cudi and Young Jeezy. ''My phone calls get returned before I finish dialing the number,'' Jay-Z said.
 ''Blueprint 3'' repeatedly insists, in songs like ''Young Forever'' and ''Off That,'' that Jay-Z is still ahead of the pack: ''Even if I slow it down, my sound is fast forward,'' he declares in ''Off That,'' while the speed of the music playfully fluctuates. He has already announced that his next album will be more experimental. Lately he has been citing indie-rock bands, and he and Beyonce showed up at an Aug. 30 Brooklyn concert by Grizzly Bear.
 ''Hip-hop is about the gift of discovery,'' he said. ''It's who has the newest sneakers, who has the new pants that no one else has seen. So if I go to school with Jay-Z on my iPod, they go, 'O.K., we all know him.' You have to come to school with some new band that no one else has heard of.''
 He continued, ''As an artist you're fighting against everything that's new and everyone's fascination with the new thing. So not only are you swimming upstream, you have someone pulling on your leg: the new guy, the weight of the new guy.''
 He shifted similes. ''It's like a crowded hallway full of people and you have to walk against it,'' he said. ''Some people don't make it to the end of the hall. You're always in the way. You have to be built for competition.''
 After a long afternoon in the studio a limo was waiting to take Jay-Z to Newark Airport for a flight to Connecticut to perform a show that night. But something had occurred to him. He stepped into the recording booth while his engineer, Young Guru, cued up ''Thank You.''
 Jay-Z instructed, ''The second half of the hook, that last one right before the verse.'' The hook repeated a couplet, a detail that needed improvement. ''It was bothering me,'' he said. ''It was a little boring in there.'' As the track played, Jay-Z matched the vocal tone he had used back when he recorded the song, caught the rhythm and rapped a new line: ''Do me a favor, don't do me no favors/I'll handle mine.'' It needed only a take or two. 
 Jay-Z smiled before setting out for the night's concert. ''That one's done,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Obama's Squandered Summer

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
THE day before he gave his latest brilliant speech, Barack Obama repeated a well-worn mantra to a television interviewer: ''My job is not to be distracted by the 24-hour news cycle.'' The time has come for him to expand that job description. His White House has a duty to push back against the 24-hour news cycle, every 24 hours if necessary, when it threatens to derail his agenda, the nation's business, or both. This was a silly summer, as wasteful in its way as the summer of 2001, when Washington dithered over the now-forgotten Gary Condit scandal while Al Qaeda plotted. The president deserves his share of the blame. 
 After a good couple of years of living with the guy, we know the drill that defines his leadership, for better and worse. When trouble lurks, No Drama Obama stays calm as everyone around him goes ballistic. Then he waits -- and waits -- for that superdramatic moment when he can ride to his own rescue with what the press reliably hypes as The Do-or-Die Speech of His Career. Cable networks slap a countdown clock on the corner of the screen and pump up the suspense. Finally, Mighty Obama steps up to the plate and, lo and behold, confounds all the doubting bloviators yet again by (as they are wont to say) hitting it out of the park.
 So it's a little disingenuous for Obama to claim that he is not distracted by the 24-hour news cycle. What he's actually doing is gaming it for all it's worth. 
 As a mode of campaigning, this tactic was worth a great deal. Obama not only produced eloquent speeches -- especially the classic disquisition on race that silenced the Jeremiah Wright pogrom -- but also executed a remarkably disciplined tortoise-vs.-hare battle plan that outwitted and ultimately vanquished the hypercaffeinated political strategies of Hillary Clinton and John McCain. As a style of governing, however, this repeated cycle of extended above-the-fray passivity followed by last-minute oratorical heroics has now been stretched to the very limit.
 Wednesday night's address on health care reform was inspired, lucid and, in the literally and figuratively Kennedyesque finale, moving. It was also (mildly) partisan, a trait much deplored by high-minded editorial writers but in real life quite useful when your party is in the majority and you want to rally the troops to get something done. But there was little in the speech that Obama couldn't have said at the summer's outset. Its practical effect may prove nil. Short of signing a mass suicide pact, the Democrats were always destined to pass a bill. Will the one to come be substantially better than the one that would have emerged if the same speech had been delivered weeks earlier? Not necessarily -- and marginally at most.
 In the meantime, a certain damage has been done -- to Obama and to the country. The inmates took over the asylum, trivializing and poisoning the national discourse while the president bided his time. The lies that Obama called out so strongly in his speech -- from ''death panels'' to ''government takeover'' -- ran amok. So did all the other incendiary faux controversies, culminating with the ludicrous outcry over the prospect that the president might speak to the nation's schoolchildren on a higher plane than, say, ''The Pet Goat.''
 None of this served his cause of health care reform or his political standing. The droop in Obama's job approval numbers isn't remotely as large or precipitous as the Beltway's incessant doomsday drumbeat suggests. But support for his signature program declined, not least because he gave others carte blanche to define it for him. Perhaps the most revealing of all the poll findings came in an end-of-August Washington Post query asking voters what ''single word'' first came to mind to describe their ''feelings'' about Obama and his health care proposals. For Obama, the No. 1 feeling was ''good.'' For the policy package he'd been ostensibly selling all summer, the No. 1 feeling was ''none.''
 It's not, as those on the right would have us believe, that Obama's ideas are so ''liberal'' that the American public recoiled. It's that much of the public didn't know what his ideas were. Even now I'm not convinced that most Americans know what a ''public option'' really means or what Obama's precise position on it is. But I'd bet that many more have a working definition of ''death panels.'' The 24-hour news cycle abhors a vacuum, and the liars and crazies filled it while Obama waited for his deus ex machina descent onto center stage. 
 That he let the hard-core base of a leaderless minority party drive the debate only diminished his stature. That's why his poll numbers on ''leadership'' declined. The right-wing fringe has become so deranged that it will yank its kids out of school to protest the president and risk yanking more Americans off assembly lines by boycotting General Motors to protest the administration's Detroit bailout. Even Laura Bush and Newt Gingrich stepped in last week to defend Obama's classroom homily from the fusillades by some of their own party's most prominent ideologues. The White House should have landed a punch before they did.
 Obama would have looked stronger if he'd stood up more proactively to the screamers along the way, or at least to the ones not packing guns. As the Roosevelt biographer Jean Edward Smith has reminded us, it didn't harm the New Deal for F.D.R. to tell a national radio audience on election eve 1936 that he welcomed the ''hatred'' of his enemies. Indeed Obama instantly gained a foot or two in height Wednesday night once that South Carolina clown hollered ''You lie!'' (One wonders what this congressman calls the Republican governor of his own state, Mark Sanford.) As the political analyst Charlie Cook has pointed out, Obama's leadership poll numbers have also suffered from his repeated deference to Congress. Waiting for the pettifogging small-state potentates of both parties in the Senate's Gang of Six is as farcical as waiting for Godot.
 Now that he has taken charge, Obama will speed the process and, we must hope, secure reform that may make a real difference for everyone, starting with the 46-million-plus Americans who have no health insurance. But when we gain some perspective on the summer of 2009, the health care debate, like the crazed town-hall sideshows surrounding it, may seem very small in the history of this presidency -- maybe even as small as the Condit follies and the breathlessly reported shark attacks of summer 2001 now look in the history of the previous administration.
 The reason is that health care reform, while an overdue imperative, still is overshadowed in existential urgency by the legacies of the two devastating cataclysms of the Bush years, 9/11 and 9/15, both of whose anniversaries we now mark. The crucial matters left unresolved in the wake of New York's two demolished capitalist icons, the World Trade Center and Lehman Brothers, are most likely to determine both this president's and our country's fate in the next few years. Both have been left to smolder in the silly summer of '09.
 As we approach the eighth anniversary of the war that 9/11 bequeathed us in Afghanistan, the endgame is still unknown and more troops are on their way. Though the rate of American casualties reached an all-time high last month, the war ranks at or near the bottom of polls tracking the issues important to the American public. Most of those who do have an opinion about the war oppose it (57 percent in the latest CNN poll released on Sept. 1) and oppose sending more combat troops (56 percent in the McClatchy-Ipsos survey, also released on Sept. 1). But the essential national debate about whether we really want to double down in Afghanistan -- and make the heavy sacrifices that would be required -- or look for a Plan B was punted by the White House this summer even as the situation drastically deteriorated.
 No less unsettling is the first-anniversary snapshot of 9/15: a rebound for Wall Street but not for the 26-million-plus Americans who are unemployed, no longer looking for jobs, or forced to settle for part-time work. Some 40 million Americans are living in poverty. While these economic body counts keep rising, tough regulatory reform for reckless financial institutions, too-big-to-fail and otherwise, seems more remote by the day. Last Sunday, Jenny Anderson of The Times exposed an example of Wall Street's unashamed recidivism that takes gallows humor to a new high -- or would were it in The Onion, not The Times. Some of the same banks that gambled their (and our) way to ruin by concocting exotic mortgage-backed securities now hope to bundle individual Americans' life insurance policies into a new high-risk financial product built on this sure-fire algorithm: ''The earlier the policyholder dies, the bigger the return.'' 
 When we look back on these months, we may come to realize that there were in fact ''death panels'' threatening Americans all along -- but they were on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border and on Wall Street, not in the fine print of a health care bill on Capitol Hill. Obama's deliberative brand of wait-and-then-pounce leadership let him squeak -- barely -- through the summer. The real crises already gathering won't wait for him to stand back and calculate the precise moment to spring the next Do-or-Die Speech.

HEADLINE: The Fading Public Option

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
It was just one line in a campaign manifesto, and it hardly seemed the most significant or contentious. As a presidential candidate, Barack Obama said he would ''establish a new public insurance program'' alongside private health care plans.
 That proposal took on a life of its own, but it now appears to be dying, a victim of an ineffectual White House strategy, the president's failure to argue passionately for the ''public option'' and all-out opposition by the insurance industry and much of the health care industry.
 In the campaign, Mr. Obama said the public plan would compete with private insurers on the price and quality of care, thus benefiting consumers. What Mr. Obama did not foresee is that, to some people on the right and the left, it would become the most important issue in the debate over health care, touching off a battle over the role of government in one of the nation's biggest, fastest-growing industries.
 Once in office Mr. Obama and his advisers have sent conflicting signals about how critical a government-run health plan would be. He prefers a public plan but is open to other ideas. 
 Dancing around the issue for eight months, Mr. Obama has seemed, at various times, pragmatic, flexible or indecisive.
 ''I just want to figure out what works,'' Mr. Obama said in March at a White House forum. If he could drive down health costs and expand coverage ''entirely through the market,'' he said, ''I'd be happy to do it that way.'' And ''if there was a way of doing it that involved more government regulation and involvement, I'm happy to do it that way, as well,'' he added.
 Champions of the public plan said it could save money by using Medicare rates and fee schedules to pay hospitals and doctors. In a book last year, one of Mr. Obama's top advisers, former Senator Tom Daschle, said consumers should have the option of enrolling in ''a government-run insurance program modeled after Medicare, a proven and popular program.''
 That is exactly what worries health care providers, who say Medicare pays them less than market rates paid by private insurers. And they have pressed their concerns on Capitol Hill with a small army of lobbyists.
 Conservatives have another concern. They see the public option as a step toward a single-payer system in which the government would pay most of the nation's health care bill and could supplant private insurers.
 ''A public plan is essentially a stalking horse for a single-payer plan,'' said Senator Judd Gregg, Republican of New Hampshire. ''It is more than the camel's nose under the tent. It is the camel's neck, and probably front legs, under the tent. There is no way the private sector will be able to compete.''
 In trying to answer this charge, Democrats feel torn. Mr. Obama and many Democrats deny that they want to drive private insurers from the market. But others embrace the ultimate goal of ''Medicare for all.'' 
 The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, which supports Mr. Obama and the public option, has long supported a single-payer system.
 In a memorandum to union leaders last year, Gerald W. McEntee, president of the 1.6-million-member federation, said a public plan would ''create a competitive check on the private market and build both public support and the infrastructure for a single-payer system.''
 Then in April, Representative Jan Schakowsky, Democrat of Illinois, said insurers were right to fear that a public plan could ''put the private insurance industry out of business.''
 That might happen because of ''the superiority of the public health care option,'' said Ms. Schakowsky, one of 86 co-sponsors of a bill to establish a single-payer system.
 Such comments provided new ammunition to Republicans already worried about the costly commitments undertaken by the federal government to stave off an economic collapse.
 Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, voiced this sense of bailout fatigue in June when he said, ''We have the takeover of the auto companies and banks and A.I.G. and student loans -- and now health care.''
 In battering the proposal for a public option, Republicans have made effective use of estimates by the Lewin Group, a consulting concern, which said that more than 100 million people might sign up for the government-run insurance plan.
 By contrast, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated that 11 million to 12 million people might enroll.
 Mr. Obama cited the lower estimate in a speech to a joint session of Congress on Wednesday, to buttress his assertion that fears of a public plan were overblown. ''We believe that less than 5 percent of Americans would sign up,'' Mr. Obama said.
 But a leader of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, Representative Lynn Woolsey, Democrat of California, predicted that over time ''more and more people will select the public option.''
 If only 5 percent of people will enroll, she asked, ''Why are the private insurance companies so worried?'' 
 The different estimates by Lewin and the Congressional Budget Office are based on different assumptions about who would be permitted to enroll in the public plan -- workers in all companies or just those in smaller businesses. 
 Many people who cite studies by the Lewin Group do not know it is a unit of Ingenix, a wholly owned subsidiary of UnitedHealth, one of the nation's largest insurers. John F. Sheils, a vice president of the Lewin Group, said the parent company had no influence over its research.
 Momentum for the public option has waned, in part, because senators have been focusing on an alternative: nonprofit member-owned insurance cooperatives.
 Apart from the question of whether co-ops would be workable or effective, they provide a politically convenient middle ground for centrists. With no immediate prospect of getting the votes for a public option in the Senate, some liberals have said they too are willing to consider the idea -- if it enables them to pass a bill, and if the co-ops are strong enough to put competitive pressure on insurance companies.
 Senator Kent Conrad, Democrat of North Dakota, who floated the idea in early June, said co-ops would accomplish ''much of what those who want a public option are calling for -- something to compete with private for-profit insurance companies.''
 At the same time, Mr. Conrad said, co-ops address Republican concerns because they are not controlled by the government.
 Liberal Democrats are not giving up. Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, said the president and Senate Democratic leaders had not made a serious effort to round up votes for a public option. If they did, he said, it could pass.
 While the White House has struggled to define its position, insurance companies have never wavered. Starting two weeks after the 2008 election, they have said they would accept greater federal regulation of their market practices if Congress also required everyone to have health insurance. 
 These may have been tactical concessions, to abate public wrath, but they were well received in Congress. While making these offers, the industry conserved its resources for the bigger battle over a public option.

HEADLINE: 'Athens' on the Net

BYLINE: By ANAND GIRIDHARADAS. 
Anand Giridharadas writes the new column ''Currents,'' on ideas, for The International Herald Tribune and nytimes.com.

 BODY:
PERHAPS the biggest big idea to gather speed during the last millennium was that we humans might govern ourselves. But no one really meant it.
 What was really meant in most places was that we would elect people to govern us and sporadically renew or revoke their contracts. It was enough. There was no practicable way to involve all of us, all the time.
 The headlines from Washington today blare of bailouts, stimulus, clunkers, Afpak, health care. But it is possible that future historians, looking back, will fixate on a quieter project of Barack Obama's White House: its exploration of how government might be opened to greater public participation in the digital age, of how to make self-government more than a metaphor. 
 President Obama declared during the campaign that ''we are the ones we've been waiting for.'' That messianic phrase held the promise of a new style of politics in this time of tweets and pokes. But it was vague, a paradigm slipped casually into our drinks. To date, the taste has proven bittersweet. 
 Federal agencies have been directed to release online information that was once sealed; reporters from Web-only publications have been called on at news conferences; the new portal Data.gov is allowing citizens to create their own applications to analyze government data. But the most revealing efforts have been in ''crowdsourcing'': in soliciting citizens' policy ideas on the Internet and allowing them to vote on one another's proposals. 
 During the transition, the administration created an online ''Citizen's Briefing Book'' for people to submit ideas to the president. ''The best-rated ones will rise to the top, and after the Inauguration, we'll print them out and gather them into a binder like the ones the president receives every day from experts and advisors,'' Valerie Jarrett, a senior adviser to Mr. Obama, wrote to supporters. 
 They received 44,000 proposals and 1.4 million votes for those proposals. The results were quietly published, but they were embarrassing -- not so much to the administration as to us, the ones we've been waiting for. 
 In the middle of two wars and an economic meltdown, the highest-ranking idea was to legalize marijuana, an idea nearly twice as popular as repealing the Bush tax cuts on the wealthy. Legalizing online poker topped the technology ideas, twice as popular as nationwide wi-fi. Revoking the Church of Scientology's tax-exempt status garnered three times more votes than raising funding for childhood cancer. 
 Once in power, the White House crowdsourced again. In March, its Office of Science and Technology Policy hosted an online ''brainstorm'' about making government more transparent. Good ideas came; but a stunning number had no connection to transparency, with many calls for marijuana legalization and a raging (and groundless) debate about the authenticity of President Obama's birth certificate. 
 If the Internet needed a further nudge from its pedestal, the health care debate obliged. From the administration's point of view, the Web arguably proved better at spreading deceptions about ''death panels'' than at spreading truth, and at turning town halls into brawls than at nurturing the unfettered deliberation that some imagine to be the hallmark of the Internet. 
 There is a lively debate in progress about what some call Gov 2.0. One camp sees in the Internet an unprecedented opportunity to bring back Athenian-style direct democracy. The vision is captured in a recent British documentary, ''Us Now,'' which paints a future in which every citizen is connected to the state as easily as to Facebook, choosing policies, questioning politicians, collaborating with neighbors. 
 ''Can we all govern?'' the movie asks at the outset. (It can, of course, be viewed on the Web.)
 The people in this camp point to information technology's aid to grassroots movements from Moldova to Iran. They look at India, where voters can now access, via text message, information on the criminal records of parliamentary candidates, and Africa, where cellphones are improving election monitoring. They note the new ease of extending reliable scientific and scholarly knowledge to a broad audience. They observe how the Internet, in democratizing access to facts and figures, encourages politician and citizen alike to base decisions on more than hunches.
 But their vision of Internet democracy is part of a larger cultural evolution toward the expectation that we be consulted about everything, all the time. Increasingly, the best articles to read are the most e-mailed ones, the music worth buying belongs to singers we have just text-voted into stardom, the next book to read is one bought by other people who bought the last book you did, and media that once reported to us now publish whatever we tweet. 
 In this new age, our consent is gathered every few minutes, not every few years. 
 Another camp sees the Internet less rosily. Its members tend to be enthusiastic about the Web and enthusiastic about civic participation; they are skeptical of the Internet as a panacea for politics. They worry that it creates a falsely reassuring illusion of equality, openness, universality. 
 ''We live in an age of democratic experimentation -- both in our official institutions and in the many informal ways in which the public is consulted,'' James Fishkin, a Stanford political scientist, writes in his new book, ''When the People Speak.'' ''Many methods and technologies can be used to give voice to the public will. But some give a picture of public opinion as if through a fun-house mirror.'' 
 Because it is so easy to filter one's reading online, extreme views dominate the discussion. Moderates are underrepresented, so citizens seeking better health care may seem less numerous than poker fans. The Internet's image of openness and equality belies its inequities of race, geography and age.
 Lies spread like wildfire on the Web; Eric Schmidt, the chief executive of Google, no Luddite, warned last October that if the great brands of trusted journalism died, the Internet would become a ''cesspool'' of bad information. Wikipedia plans to add a layer of editing -- remember editing? -- for articles on living people. 
 Perhaps most menacingly, the Internet's openness allows well-organized groups to simulate support, to ''capture and impersonate the public voice,'' as Mr. Fishkin wrote in an e-mail exchange. 
 There is no turning back the clock. We now have more public opinion exerting pressure on politics than ever before. The question is how it may be channeled and filtered to create freer, more successful societies, because simply putting things online is no cure-all. 
 ''At this moment, the conversation is not whether the Internet is important and is going to be widespread,'' said Clay Shirky, an Internet theorist and the author of ''Here Comes Everybody: The Power of Organizing Without Organizations.'' He added, in a telephone interview: ''Now that it is so important, it's actually too important not to think through the constitutional and governance issues involved.'' 
 A search is on for the right metaphor. What is the new role for government -- a platform? a vending machine, into which we put money to extract services? a facilitator? And what, indeed, is the new role for us -- the ones we've been waiting for?

Golf Diplomacy: Speak Softly and Carry a 9-Iron
 In Newsweek, Richard N. Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, offers a ''fairway theory'' for gauging friendliness toward the United States.
 Vietnam, for years a bitter foe of the United States, is now a friend. The clearest evidence of how far things have changed may be the Ho Chi Minh Golf Trail, a route that connects more than a half-dozen luxury golf courses and resorts. (Like its namesake, the golf trail runs north-south, but presumably the resemblance ends there.) On the other hand, Venezuela, led by the ever-hostile Hugo Chavez, has closed several golf courses and is threatening to shut down others. Chavez recently delivered a tirade against golf on national television, deriding it as ''bourgeois,'' an outlook consistent with his repressive policies, which are driving many middle-class Venezuelans to leave the country. Or take the two Koreas: the closed North is reportedly home to just three courses, while democratic South Korea, a U.S. ally, boasts no fewer than 234.
 Why I Love Al Jazeera 
 Yes, Al Jazeera has overt prejudices, like its strong pro-Palestinian tilt, writes Robert D. Kaplan in The Atlantic. But it also ''excels at opening your mind'':
 The Qatar-based Arab TV channel's eclectic internationalism -- a feast of vivid, pathbreaking coverage from all continents -- is a rebuke to the dire predictions about the end of foreign news as we know it. Indeed, if Al Jazeera were more widely available in the United States -- on nationwide cable, for example, instead of only on the Web and several satellite stations and local cable channels -- it would eat steadily into the viewership of ''The NewsHour With Jim Lehrer.'' Al Jazeera -- not Lehrer -- is what the internationally minded elite class really yearns for: a visually stunning, deeply reported description of developments in dozens upon dozens of countries simultaneously.
 Over just a few days in late May, when I actively monitored Al Jazeera (although I watched it almost every evening during a month in Sri Lanka), I was treated to penetrating portraits of Eritrean and Ethiopian involvement in the Somali war, of the struggle of Niger River rebels against the Nigerian government in the oil-rich south of the country, of the floods in Bangladesh, of problems with the South African economy, of the danger that desertification poses to Bedouin life in northern Sudan, of the environmental devastation around the Aral Sea, of Sikh violence in India after an attack on a temple in Austria, of foreign Islamic fighters in the southern Philippines, of microfinancing programs in Kenya, of rigged elections in South Ossetia, of human-rights demonstrations in Guatemala, and of much more. 
 Fairy Tales Grow Longer in the Tooth
 In The London Telegraph, Richard Gray reports that anthropologists have found that popular fairy tales are more ancient than previously thought:
 Dr. Jamie Tehrani, a cultural anthropologist at Durham University, studied 35 versions of ''Little Red Riding Hood'' from around the world. 
 Whilst the European version tells the story of a little girl who is tricked by a wolf masquerading as her grandmother, in the Chinese version a tiger replaces the wolf. In Iran, where it would be considered odd for a young girl to roam alone, the story features a little boy. 
 Contrary to the view that the tale originated in France shortly before Charles Perrault produced the first written version in the 17th century, Dr. Tehrani found that the variants shared a common ancestor dating back more than 2,600 years. He said: ''Over time these folk tales have been subtly changed and have evolved just like an biological organism.''
 For People Who Love Ketchup
 From The London Telegraph's ''20 most bizarre'' Craigslist ads of all time:
 Free -- international ketchup packet collection. This is a collection of ketchup packets from around the world. Approximately 25 countries are represented here, including Japan, Finland, Estonia, Greenland, Brazil, and Portugal. None of the packets have been opened and they are labeled with their home country. Collection comes in decorative box with ducks on it.

HEADLINE: Thousands Attend Broad Protest of Government

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY; Theo Emery and Ashley Southall contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
A sea of protesters filled the west lawn of the Capitol and spilled onto the National Mall on Saturday in the largest rally against President Obama since he took office, a culmination of a summer-long season of protests that began with opposition to a health care overhaul and grew into a broader dissatisfaction with government. 
 On a cloudy and cool day, the demonstrators came from all corners of the country, waving American flags and handwritten signs explaining the root of their frustrations. Their anger stretched well beyond the health care legislation moving through Congress, with shouts of support for gun rights, lower taxes and a smaller government. 
 But as they sang verse after verse of patriotic hymns like ''God Bless America,'' sharp words of profane and political criticism were aimed at Mr. Obama and Congress. 
 Dick Armey, a former House Republican leader whose group Freedomworks helped organize the protest, stood before the crowd and led the rallying cries in nearly the same spot where Mr. Obama took his oath of office eight months ago.
 ''He pledged a commitment of fidelity to the United States Constitution,'' Mr. Armey said, suggesting that Mr. Obama was in violation of what the founding fathers intended the size and scope of the government to be.
 ''Liar! Liar! Liar! Liar!'' the crowd shouted back, echoing the accusation that Representative Joe Wilson, Republican of South Carolina, hurled at the president three days earlier during his address to Congress.
 The demonstrators numbered well into the tens of thousands, though the police declined to estimate the size of the crowd. Many came on their own and were not part of an organization or group. But the magnitude of the rally took the authorities by surprise, with throngs of people streaming from the White House to Capitol Hill for more than three hours.
 The atmosphere was rowdy at times, with signs and images casting Mr. Obama in a demeaning light. One sign called him the ''parasite in chief.'' Others likened him to Hitler. Several people held up preprinted signs saying, ''Bury Obama Care with Kennedy,'' a reference to the Massachusetts senator whose body passed by the Capitol two weeks earlier to be memorialized.
 Other signs did not focus on Mr. Obama, but rather on the government at large, promoting gun rights, tallying the national deficit and deploring illegal immigrants living in the United States.
 Still, many demonstrators expressed their views without a hint of rage. They said the size of the crowd illustrated that their views were shared by a broader audience. 
 ''I want Congress to be afraid,'' said Keldon Clapp, 45, an unemployed marketing representative who recently moved to Tennessee from Connecticut after losing his job. ''Like everyone else here, I want them to know that we're watching what they're doing. And they do work for us.''
 As Mr. Obama traveled to Minnesota on Saturday to rally support for his health care plan, he flew over the assembling crowd in Marine One. The helicopter could be seen flying overhead as the demonstrators marched down Pennsylvania Avenue. 
 ''This is not some kind of radical right-wing group,'' Senator Jim DeMint, Republican of South Carolina, said in an interview as dozens of people streamed by him. ''I just hope the Congress, the Senate and the president recognize that people are afraid of what's going on.'' 
 Mr. DeMint and a few Republican legislators were the only party leaders on hand for the demonstration. Republican officials said privately that they were pleased by the turnout but wary of the anger directed at all politicians. And most of those who turned out were not likely to have been Obama voters anyway. 
 Protesters came by bus, car and airplane, arriving here from Texas and Tennessee, New Mexico and New Hampshire, Ohio and Oregon. The messages on their signs told of an intense distrust of the government, which several people said began long before Mr. Obama took office. 
 For the most part, Democrats stayed silent on Saturday, with the exception of a small group of counterdemonstrators who gathered behind a roadblock to protest what they called a ''right-wing rally.'' Many were members of the clergy, who said they were concerned about misinformation propagated by opponents of health care legislation. 
 ''We'd like to have an honest debate,'' said Chris Korzen, director of the nonprofit Catholics United. ''I don't see a lot of substance here.''
 While there was no shortage of vitriol among protesters, there was also an air of festivity. A band of protesters in colonial gear wended through the crowd, led by a bell ringer in a tricorn hat calling for revolution. A folk singer belting out a protest ballad on a guitar brought cheers.
 In conversations with demonstrators, people identified themselves as Republicans, libertarians, independents and former Democrats. Several speakers denounced the Obama administration's health care plan as ''socialism.'' A few Confederate flags waved in the air, but there were hundreds of American flags and chants of, ''U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!'' A young girl held a sign saying, ''Don't redistribute the wealth of my Barbies.''
 Ruth Lobbs, 57, a schoolteacher from Jacksonville, Fla., said she flew to Washington on Saturday to protest how she believes the government has violated the Constitution. She said she did not vote for the president, adding that her anger has been building for years.
 ''It's more than Obama -- this isn't a Republican or a Democratic issue,'' Ms. Lobbs said as she held a yellow flag that declared, ''Don't Tread on Me.'' 
 ''I don't know if anything will come of this or not,'' she said, ''but this is a peaceful way of showing our frustration.''

HEADLINE: Cuban Exile's Plan for a Ferry From Miami to Havana Is Awaiting U.S. Approval

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE

DATELINE: MIAMI 

 BODY:
Imagine a ferry from Miami to Havana that costs far less than a flight. Cuban-Americans, who can now visit the island without restriction, could eat lechon on deck, then deliver a shipping container of food to needy relatives by morning.
 Armando Ruiz, 72, a Cuban exile and former concert promoter, has dreamed of this for a decade. Now he thinks it might actually happen -- if the Obama administration approves his application for a license. 
 ''He says he wants to help the Cuban people,'' Mr. Ruiz said, referring to President Obama. ''How can he do it without a ship?''
 Until recently, Miami's community of Cuban exiles was considered far too volatile to handle a ferry cruising from Florida to Cuba for the first time since 1962 . But Mr. Ruiz's proposal shows how much the political climate here has changed. 
 It is faith in pent-up demand for a new approach that has led Mr. Ruiz to consider chartering a $23 million, 600-cabin cruise-ferry from a dealer in Lithuania. It may also be the dream of riches, which he denies, or family legacy, which he does not. But for the White House, his proposal mainly shows how a shift from policymakers can produce demands that outpace diplomatic deliberation. 
 Ever since the president announced plans in April to encourage contact with Cuba by letting Cuban-Americans travel back whenever they wanted and send more money and gifts, the administration has found itself fending off pressure to move more quickly toward normalized relations. 
 Cuban officials, some members of Congress and travel companies like Orbitz have all demanded that the travel ban be lifted, not just for Cuban exiles but for all Americans. Charter flight operators in Miami, after praising the new approach, spent the summer complaining that the administration took too long to publish regulations that put the policy for Cuban-Americans into effect. 
 And now that the new rules are out -- published in the Federal Register this month -- entrepreneurs are stepping up with ideas for expanding links with Cuba. 
 Mr. Ruiz's ferry is one of several proposals that aim to push through the door that Mr. Obama opened just a crack. Direct flights from Los Angeles to Havana started in June. Several other cities, including Tampa and New Orleans, may also soon offer flights to Cuba through charter companies. 
 Cultural exchanges that could grant travel rights to Americans who are not of Cuban descent are in the works with charter operators in Miami -- a tactic widely used under President Bill Clinton and severely restricted by President George W. Bush. 
 Eddy Levy, 75, co-owner of Xael Travel, said the entire travel industry, including charter companies like his own, were laying the groundwork for what they hoped would be a more significant opening. 
 ''The important thing is the relationship between the two countries,'' said Mr. Levy, who has focused on connecting Jewish families in Cuba and the United States. ''It's one very big step toward normalizing relations if the United States opens travel to the non-Cubans.''
 He said that allowing all Americans to go to Cuba would mean enough travelers to go around -- on commercial flights, on ferries and on charters. 
 Tessie Aral, president of ABC Charters, which flew 10,500 passengers to Cuba this summer, up from 6,000 last year, agreed.
 ''I think all of that will be wonderful when all travel restrictions are lifted,'' Ms. Aral said. ''But we're not there yet.'' 
 At this point, Mr. Ruiz sees his proposed ferry service mainly as an alternative for those with less money, more gifts or an inability to fly because of illness or fear. He described the seven or so charter companies -- the only businesses with landing rights from both the American and Cuban governments -- as a monopoly that charges too much (around $500 round trip) because of minimal competition. 
 He said he got the idea for a ferry about 15 years ago on a trip to Cuba. He was buying cigars in a poor section of Havana from a man who said no one in his building could afford a television. 
 ''I thought, we have so many televisions that get thrown out,'' said Mr. Ruiz, in an interview at his luxury apartment building overlooking the Atlantic. ''If I had a ship, I could bring so many and donate them.'' 
 Cargo seemed to excite him the most. Mr. Ruiz's eyes brightened behind his Dolce & Gabbana eyeglasses when he said that someone who could take only 44 pounds of luggage on a plane without paying extra would be able to carry four times as much onto the boat. It would all be part of the ferry ticket price, he said, which would probably run about $100 less than plane fare. 
 The schedule would include at least three overnight round trips a week.
 Think of the possibilities, he said: bicycles and toys for Christmas; food, medicines and construction materials after hurricanes. He said his company, Florida Ferry International, had interested investors, including Cuban-Americans, and management companies ready to staff the ship. He said the business would cost somewhere from $300,000 to $1 million dollars a month to operate, depending on the boat leased and the partners involved. 
 Critics of greater engagement, like Mauricio Claver-Carone of the U.S.-Cuba Democracy PAC, said it would never happen ''without reciprocity on democratic reforms and human rights by the Cuban regime.''
 Cuba could also refuse to let Mr. Ruiz dock his boat or -- struggling with an economy as bad as it has ever been -- try to charge exorbitant fees. 
 But in his eyes, Washington is the source of the holdup. His application notes that the law governing travel allows licenses not just for aircraft but also for vessels. The State Department, where Mr. Ruiz's lawyer has been told the license request now sits, did not respond to calls or an e-mail message. 
 ''How could he deny it if he says he wants to open up Cuba,'' said Mr. Ruiz, a Republican who voted for Mr. Obama and carries a photo of him in his Blackberry. ''This is not a dream. This is a right.''

HEADLINE: China Denounces New Tire Tariffs

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS and EDWARD WONG; Edmund L. Andrews reported from Washington and Edward Wong from Beijing.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Within hours of President Obama's decision to penalize imports of automobile tires from China, Chinese officials accused the United States of violating international trade laws and succumbing to political pressure for protectionism.
 ''China is firmly opposed to this measure of serious commercial protectionism by the United States,'' the Chinese ministry of commerce said Saturday.
 The sharp and swift reaction, though not necessarily indicative of a serious new clash, amounted to a warning shot just at a time when American officials need China's help on issues including the global economic recovery and possible additional sanctions on Iran over its nuclear program. 
 Few decisions by President Obama have appeared more uncomfortable and fraught with larger considerations than the blandly worded announcement at 9:15 p.m. Friday that he would impose a tariff of 35 percent on Chinese tires for cars and light trucks.
 The announcement seemed aimed at assuaging demands by organized labor for more protection against imports while also tamping down labor's expectations of a combative new stance toward China.
 Mr. Obama is counting on unions to mobilize support in Congress and at the grass-roots level for his campaign to overhaul the health care system. The A.F.L.-C.I.O. has weighed in with a formidable campaign, involving armies of people as well as media efforts and lobbying. 
 White House officials said they were merely invoking tools that the United States explicitly negotiated with China as part of its acceptance into the World Trade Organization. 
 ''Our view is that enforcing trade laws is not protectionism,'' said one senior White House official, who refused to be identified. 
 The White House is keenly aware of the huge stakes it has in maintaining good relations with China. American businesses, including tire companies, are big investors in China and have factories there. American companies are also struggling to expand exports to China's huge and increasingly affluent population.
 Later this month, President Obama will meet with China's leaders when he hosts a meeting in Pittsburgh of leaders from the Group of 20 industrialized and large emerging nations. In November, Mr. Obama is expected to travel to Beijing after attending a meeting in Singapore with Asian leaders.
 Elaborating on the written statement from the Chinese commerce ministry, Yao Jian, a ministry spokesman, said that ''China would reserve all rights to take responsive actions to firmly protect the interests of Chinese companies,'' according to Xinhua, the official Chinese news agency. The article did not elaborate on those ''responsive actions.''
 On its own, Mr. Obama's decision will affect only a tiny sliver of American imports from China, which is now the United States' second-largest trading partner and its biggest creditor.
 The United Steelworkers, which represents tire workers, had asked the Obama administration to invoke a special safeguard provision in an agreement with China that allows the government to impose tariffs if there is a ''surge'' in imports or a ''material disruption'' to American companies or workers.
 The International Trade Commission, an independent federal agency, ruled in late June that Chinese tire imports had indeed disrupted the domestic industry. 
 The panel recommended that the president impose tariffs for three years, starting at 55 percent and then declining. Mr. Obama, who was required by law to decide on the recommendation by Sept. 17, announced slightly lower tariffs that will start at 35 percent and drop to 25 percent in the third year.
 The safeguard provision does not require any evidence that Chinese companies used subsidies or competed unfairly, so it is easier in some ways to invoke than many other protective measures against imports.
 The big question is whether Mr. Obama's decision on Chinese tires will prompt a rash of petitions for relief from other aggrieved industries or unions.
 Few groups have petitioned for relief as Chinese exports gained broad access to the United States in 2001, and the I.T.C. recommended tariffs in only four cases out of six. But the small number of cases stemmed in part from the fact that former President Bush rejected all four of the commission's recommendations to invoke the safeguard provision.
 Charlene Barshefsky, who served as United States Trade Representative under President Clinton, said she did not think the decision signals any broad reversal in trade policy. ''The administration has made it clear that it recognizes that open markets are one of the keys to the economic recovery,'' Ms. Barshefsky said.

HEADLINE: Same Old Hope: This Bubble Is Different

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL

 BODY:
This time is different.
 That's what people argue every time a bubble inflates, and what they think every time they are chastened by its popping. But century after century, decade after decade and year after year, human beings irrationally exuberate all over again.
 Not long ago, the housing bubble burst and brought the global economy to a standstill. Now economists, recognizing that bubbles tend to come in bunches, are on the lookout for the next market to fizzle. They say that governments, central banks and international bodies should scrutinize a few markets that look likely to froth over in the next few years, like capital markets in China, commodities like gold and oil, and government bonds in heavily indebted countries like the United States. 
 ''Globally, a lot of money is now seeking higher returns once again,'' said Rachel Ziemba, senior analyst at RGE Monitor. The steadying of the economy, liquidity injections by governments and big returns reaped early this year by investment banks are encouraging more traders to dip their toes back in the water in search of the next big thing.
 ''As long as compensation and bonuses are based on short-term performance in the market,'' she said, ''that's going to encourage risk-seeking behavior.'' 
 Bubbles are episodes of collective human madness -- euphoria over investments whose skyrocketing values are unsustainable. 
 They tend to arise from perceptions of pending shortages (as happened last year, with the oil bubble); from glamorized new technologies or investment frontiers (like the dot-com bubble of the 1990s, the radio bubble of the 1920s or the multiple railroad bubbles of the 19th century); or from faddish cultural obsessions (like the Dutch tulip bubble of the 17th century, or the more recent Beanie Babies bubble). 
 Often they are based on legitimate expectations of high growth that are ''extrapolated into the stratosphere,'' as the economist Daniel Yergin, chairman of IHS-Cambridge Energy Research Associates, put it. Such is the fear over investment in emerging markets like China.
 ''I'm a long-term bull on Asia, but right now it's premature to be celebrating the 'Asian Century,' like some investors seem to be doing,'' said Stephen Roach, chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia. 
 The Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index, for example, nearly doubled from November to July before pulling back last month. ''People seem to believe the baton of global economic leadership is being seamlessly passed from the West to the East. That's going to happen, but not for another 5 to 10 years at least.''
 Similarly premature excitement inflated what became known as the South Sea bubble, a 18th century mania over British trade with emerging Latin American markets. (Aside: Even the brilliant Sir Isaac Newton, seduced by the mirage of infinitely rising stock prices, lost a lot in the South Sea bubble -- which is somewhat ironic, given his famous recognition that what goes up must come down.)
 Economists also worry that commodity bubbles, which tend to be more cyclical, may strike again. Oil and gold prices are rising, and though both of those commodities have boomed and busted many times in the last century, investors may bet on unrealistically high growth once more. Gold prices, for example, have risen more than 30 percent from a year ago.
 ''With every commodity bubble, you see a whole new set of rationalizations,'' Mr. Yergin said. ''People find ways to shut out the reality of economic processes. If oil prices shoot up, investors are always surprised to see demand go down again.''
 In each of these markets, the inflation and deflation of prices would be painful to investors but may not have as far-reaching consequences as the recent housing and credit collapses. 
 But a sovereign debt bubble -- which many argue is driving the acceleration in gold prices -- could prove far more dangerous.
 So many countries, like the United States, are running up such large national debts as a percentage of their overall economies that they could risk eventual default. Even without outright default on their obligations, the value of government bonds sold to finance these deficits could plunge, costing investors a lot. 
 ''Talk about a big bubble that really affects the global economy,'' said Kenneth Rogoff, an economics professor at Harvard whose new book, ''This Time Is Different,'' chronicles 800 years of debt-driven financial crises. 
 ''The huge run-up in government debt has led to patently unsustainable fiscal policies across a number of major countries,'' he said. ''So far, the rest of the world's been willing to finance it, primarily with savings from China and elsewhere, but if investors' confidence is shaken, we might see the interest rates on long-term debt rising, and rising very sharply.''
 Debt crises are usually associated with developing countries, like Brazil, Argentina or Zimbabwe. But they can affect big, rich economies too, where the scale of global damage can be much greater.
 ''Look at California,'' Mr. Rogoff said. ''It's incredibly rich, but Californians want a lot of services but don't feel like taxing themselves to pay for them. You can be incredibly rich and still go bankrupt.''
 The depth and breadth of the pain unleashed by the recent housing bust have led political leaders and central bankers to reconsider their duties to pre-empt, rather than just respond to, potential bubbles, and the same is true with the potential bubbles that economists foresee today.
 China has started to tighten monetary policy to rein in the hype surrounding its equities. Politicians in the United States, while torn over the means, are discussing ways to bring the deficit until control.
 The Group of 20, at its coming meeting in Pittsburgh, is expected to address ways to calm financial frenzies. The solution may involve additional regulation, guidelines for financial compensation and possibly requirements for more market transparency so that, at least in theory, investors can better judge what they are taking on. 
 But however stringent such new regulations may be, economists say, they cannot completely defeat human nature. Investors will continue to be hypnotized by get-rich-quick deals, seeking investments that magically double, double without toil or trouble. 
 ''Ultimately, bubbles are a human phenomenon,'' said Robert Shiller, a Yale economics professor and Cassandra of the current crisis. ''People just get a little crazy.''

HEADLINE: Europeans to Keep Sanctions on Zimbabwe

BYLINE: By BARRY BEARAK

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG 

 BODY:
Leaders of a European Union delegation to Zimbabwe said Sunday that they were not ready to withdraw economic sanctions against the nation's longtime president, Robert Mugabe, citing widespread human rights violations and the floundering state of a year-old power-sharing deal between political rivals there.
 Ending a weekend visit, Karel De Gucht, the European commissioner for development and humanitarian aid, told reporters in the capital of Zimbabwe, Harare, that the two main partners in the power-sharing arrangement -- Mr. Mugabe and Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai -- remained at loggerheads over the agreement both signed last September. 
 ''They do not have the same reading of the same document,'' Mr. De Gucht said, summing up the findings of the first high-level European Union visit to Zimbabwe in seven years, according to The Associated Press. ''They have a different reading on how this should be done and at what speed.''
 Gunilla Carlsson, the international development minister of Sweden, said there was a candid exchange with Mr. Mugabe, who has run Zimbabwe for nearly three decades.
 ''We had reasons to raise very serious concerns, for example on media freedom and constitutional reforms,'' she told news agencies. ''We still have a lot of reports of human rights violations, which are unacceptable.''
 President Mugabe no doubt had hoped for more. For the weekend, he set aside his usual vitriol for the West, greeting the delegation ''with open arms'' and remarking about how well he was getting along with his visitors.
 But this show of bonhomie could not mask the fact that he and Mr. Tsvangirai -- strange political bedfellows given their longstanding animosity -- continue to argue about who is entitled to various positions in government. The European delegation specifically criticized the president for continuing to block the replacement of the attorney general, regional governors and the chief of the central bank.
 There was much at stake for Mr. Mugabe. The European Union has applied travel and financial restrictions to 203 people and 40 companies linked to the president and his political party, ZANU-PF.
 Financial aid continues, however. ''We have never stopped helping Zimbabwe,'' news agencies quoted Mr. De Gucht as saying. Since 2002, the 27-nation European bloc has given Zimbabwe nearly $1 billion. But the assistance has been administered for humanitarian purposes, rather than development projects controlled by the government.
 Mr. Mugabe, a university-trained liberation hero, had expected his improbable partnership with Mr. Tsvangirai, a working-class former union leader, to bring the return of reticent international donors. Indeed, the prime minister has traveled to both Europe and the United States, pleading for billions in aid to rebuild Zimbabwe's moribund economy. 
 But donors are caught in a quandary: Should money be given to Zimbabwe while Mr. Mugabe and his loyalists continue to violate human rights and renege on portions of the deal made with Mr. Tsvangirai? 
 During an election season in March and June of last year, ZANU-PF used ruthless measures to crush its political opposition. Mr. Tsvangirai had bested Mr. Mugabe in the first vote, though a runoff was required. The opposition leader dropped out of the second election as hundreds of his followers fell victim to murder, kidnapping, arson and torture.
 While the violence has sharply diminished, the tactics of intimidation continue. The government has arrested several members of Parliament who represent Mr. Tsvangirai's party, the Movement for Democratic Change. The M.D.C. holds a narrow majority in the legislature, and its leaders believe Mr. Mugabe is trying to deprive them of that numerical edge during negotiations for a new Constitution.
 On Sunday, at a rally celebrating the 10th anniversary of the M.D.C., Mr. Tsvangirai railed against his supposed partner in unity. He said he would not stand by while Mr. Mugabe's party ''continues to violate the law, persecutes our members of Parliament, spreads the language of hate, invades our productive farms and ignores our international treaties.''

HEADLINE: Disney Plans 'Interactive' Updates in Theme Parks

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES and ANDREW J. MARTIN

 BODY:
Moving to reinvigorate some aging corners of its domestic theme parks, the Walt Disney Company announced plans over the weekend to modernize its Star Tours rides and greatly expand Fantasyland at Walt Disney World in Florida. 
 Disney's theme parks, an $11.5 billion annual business that is closely scrutinized as a consumer confidence bellwether, have struggled in the recession. Wall Street has praised the company, however, for quickly moving to limit the damage through aggressive discounting.
 Now comes a second offensive no less important to the company's immediate operating strategy, but more indicative of its long-term thinking: focused, occasionally deep capital spending to ensure that attractions are relevant to modern consumers.
 The Fantasyland section of the Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Fla., will receive the larger share of the overhaul and expansion attention. The Magic Kingdom, which opened in 1971 and forms the heart of the broader resort, faces a new competitor: the Wizarding World of Harry Potter will open next year at nearby Universal's Islands of Adventure.
 Among the new or reworked attractions coming to Fantasyland over the next three years are an elaborate area where children can dance with Cinderella, celebrate Sleeping Beauty's birthday or interact with Belle from ''Beauty and the Beast.'' There will also be a redesigned Dumbo the Flying Elephant ride and the addition of Pixie Hollow, a Tinker Bell-themed experience that opened last year at Disneyland in California.
 ''We're always exploring new ways to tell new stories in new places,'' Jay Rasulo, chairman of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, said Saturday at D23, a Disney-sponsored fan convention that concluded its four-day run on Sunday at the Anaheim Convention Center. Disney would not say how much it was spending on its theme park changes.
 Mr. Rasulo also confirmed a long-speculated overhaul of Star Tours. The Disneyland and Disney World versions of the popular but antiquated simulation ride will reopen in 2011 with 3-D effects. Star Tours, originally built around the first three ''Star Wars'' films, will be updated to reflect George Lucas's three prequels. Disney provided few details, but a snippet of new Star Tours footage shown at D23 was particularly reminiscent of ''Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace.''
 Disney also gave updates on a previously announced $1 billion overhaul of California Adventure, the park that opened eight years ago next to Disneyland that has underperformed. The planned World of Color fountain attraction will open in the spring, the ''Little Mermaid'' ride will open in 2011, and the 12-acre Cars Land will have its debut in 2012.
 Bruce Vaughn, chief creative executive for Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, said the updates were intended to make the parks more interactive to reflect the changing nature of consumer entertainment.
 Instead of simply shaking hands with characters or getting a hug, children will be ''immersed in their world,'' Mr. Vaughn said.
 For instance, children will help fairies prepare a 16th birthday party for Aurora from ''Sleeping Beauty,'' and help Cinderella prepare for the ball, he said.
 ''What we are doing is making the guests more active rather than passive,'' he said, adding that consumers were no longer content as simply ''voyeurs.''

HEADLINE: Cost-Saving Policy Forces New Kidney Transplant

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO 

 BODY:
Melissa J. Whitaker has one very compelling reason to keep up with the health care legislation being written in Washington: her second transplanted kidney. 
 The story of Ms. Whitaker's two organ donations -- the first from her mother and the second from her boyfriend -- sheds light on a Medicare policy that is widely regarded as pound-foolish. Although the government regularly pays $100,000 or more for kidney transplants, it stops paying for anti-rejection drugs after only 36 months.
 The health care bill moving through the House of Representatives includes a little-noticed provision that would reverse the policy, but it is not clear whether the Senate will follow suit. The 36-month limit is one of several reimbursement anomalies -- along with inadequate primary care payments and incentives that encourage unneeded care -- that many in Congress hope to cure.
 Ms. Whitaker, 31, who describes herself as ''kind of a nerd,'' has Alport syndrome, a genetic disorder that caused kidney failure and significant hearing loss by the time she was 14. In 1997, after undergoing daily dialysis for five years, she received her first transplant. Most of the cost of the dialysis and the transplant, totaling hundreds of thousands of dollars, was absorbed by the federal Medicare program, which provides broad coverage for those with end-stage renal disease. 
 Despite that heavy investment, federal law limits Medicare reimbursement for the immunosuppressant drugs that transplant recipients must take for life, at costs of $1,000 to $3,000 a month.
 Once Ms. Whitaker's Medicare expired, she faced periods without work and, more important, without group health insurance, which disregards pre-existing conditions. Struggling financially, she soon found herself skipping doses of anti-rejection drugs.
 By late 2003, her transplanted kidney had failed, and she returned to dialysis, covered by the government at $9,300 a month, more than three times the cost of the pills. Then 15 months ago, Medicare paid for her second transplant -- total charges, $125,000 -- and the 36-month clock began ticking again.
 ''If they had just paid for the pills, I'd still have my kidney,'' said Ms. Whitaker, who shares an apartment in the La Jolla neighborhood with her boyfriend, Joseph D. Jamieson. ''I'd be healthy, working and paying taxes.'' 
 The Medicare program is not sure how many of the country's 100,000 transplant recipients are without insurance for their immunosuppressant drugs. Officials with the National Kidney Foundation said some dialysis patients never put themselves on transplant lists because they fear that they will not be able to afford the drugs. 
 Currently unemployed, Ms. Whitaker is nervous that in two years she will again find herself without health coverage. She and Mr. Jamieson, who have been together five years, said they would marry if necessary so he could insure her under the group policy provided by his employer, the drug manufacturer Pfizer. But nothing is guaranteed.
 ''If Joe were ever to lose his job or medical coverage, I do feel it would be possible for me to find myself without insurance again,'' said Ms. Whitaker, who reads lips to compensate for her hearing loss. ''I'm extremely nervous about whether I'm going to be able to afford my medications once my coverage runs out.''
 Bills have been introduced in Congress since 2000 to lift the 36-month limit and extend coverage of immunosuppressant drugs indefinitely. They have never made it to a vote, largely because of the projected upfront cost; the Congressional Budget Officeestimates that unlimited coverage would add $100 million a year to the $23 billion Medicare kidney program.
 But the cost-benefit analysis would seem obvious. The most recent report from the United States Renal Data System found that Medicare spends an average of $17,000 a year on care for kidney transplant recipients, most of it for anti-rejection drugs. That compares with $71,000 a year for dialysis patients and $106,000 for a transplant (including the first year of monitoring).
 ''It doesn't make any sense at all,'' Ms. Whitaker said. ''Somebody's not looking at the numbers.''
 A provision to cover the drugs is in the sweeping House health care bill, which has cleared three committees. It is uncertain whether the Senate Finance Committee will include it in its bill.
 Since 1973, end-stage renal disease has been the only condition specifically covered by Medicare regardless of age. In 1988, coverage was extended for 12 months to anti-rejection drugs, which had recently been developed. Congress gradually lengthened the cutoff to 36 months, and then in 2000 made the benefit unlimited for those who are at least 65 or disabled. The rationale for leaving out younger transplant recipients was simply that the money was not there, Congressional aides said. 
 Ms. Whitaker was married when her Medicare eligibility expired after her first transplant, and her husband was able to insure her under his group policy. They divorced in 2001, and she became uninsured until taking a job at Kinko's that provided health benefits.
 Her downward spiral began the day she awoke to find that her dog had used her hearing aids as a chew toy. She could not afford replacements and had to leave her job because she was unable to interact with customers.
 She lived in Seattle for a while without electricity or hot water. The bank repossessed her car, and she filed for bankruptcy. Her grandmother eventually bought her new hearing aids, and she went back to work. But she was laid off a year later.
 ''That's when I started stretching out the pills,'' she said. ''I'd take one in the morning and one at night, instead of two. Toward the end, I ran out of pills and was taking nothing for a couple of months. I figured I was young and could make it until I found insurance.'' 
 She figured wrong. When she arrived at an emergency room, weak from weight loss and anemia, her doctors told her they were surprised she was not in a coma. The kidney, they said, had not been functioning at all.
 ''I felt really guilty because it was my mom's kidney and I broke it,'' Ms. Whitaker said.
 Ms. Whitaker moved back to Southern California to live with her mother, and soon met Mr. Jamieson. He is seven years younger and, at 6-foot-8, stands 16 inches taller, but they had what Mr. Jamieson calls ''a mutual dork synchronicity'' (they share a passion for video games). He bought her a stuffed kidney, with a ureter nose, and almost immediately offered her one of his kidneys.
 She declined. ''I didn't want to start dating somebody and steal his kidney,'' she said. ''That seemed kind of rude.''
 Several years later, she reversed course and accepted the transplant on June 10, 2008. She has suffered several minor rejection episodes, but lately has been feeling well.
 The couple gets by on Mr. Jamieson's paycheck and Ms. Whitaker's Social Security benefits. With the help of financial aid, she recently completed two years at a community college and will soon start classes at the University of California, San Diego. She said she hoped a degree would help her find a job with health coverage, perhaps as an addiction counselor.
 But her bigger hope is that Congress will eliminate the 36-month limit so she can pursue any job, without concern for insurance. 
 ''My whole life is dictated by my illness, and it's such a waste,'' Ms. Whitaker said. ''If the government is going to spend all that money to help people get a kidney, they should help you keep it.''

HEADLINE: Botched Most Answers on New York State Math Test? You Still Pass

BYLINE: By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ; Robert Gebeloff contributed reporting.

 BODY:
For many students, bungling more than half the questions on a test would mean an F and all that comes with it -- months of remedial work, irksome teachers and, perhaps, a skimpy allowance. But on New York State's math exam this year, seventh graders who correctly answered just 44 percent of questions were rewarded with a passing grade.
 What gives? 
 Three years ago, the threshold for passing was 60 percent. In fact, students in every grade this year could slide by with fewer correct answers on the math test than in 2006. 
 In math this year, 86 percent of students statewide passed the test, scoring at least a Level 3 (of 4), and 82 percent passed in English, the highest percentages in many years. But the lower passing scores, especially for math, have provided fodder for skeptics who believe the state has made it easier for struggling students to pass. 
 In New York City, which saw some of the largest gains, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has used the scores as evidence of his successful leadership of the schools. The jump in passing rates also helped 97 percent of the city's schools earn A's or B's on their Department of Education report cards this year.
 The mayor also has repeatedly pledged to hold back students who fail the test and do not meet even Level 2, a minimal standard. But the number of right answers needed to reach Level 2 has also dropped, to the point that on some tests, a student could randomly guess and still stand a good chance of moving on to the next grade. 
 State education officials say that they have not made it easier to pass the tests, and that the scoring thresholds have dropped for a simple reason: the test questions themselves have actually become harder. As a result, they have reduced the number of correct answers required to pass some exams to make the tests comparable over the years. 
 At a time when the tests are assuming an unprecedented role in classrooms across the state -- used for everything from analyzing student deficiencies to determining which educators deserve cash bonuses -- the debate underscores a central question: How accurate are the exams in measuring student learning and progress, and what skills should a passing grade reflect? 
 Already, New York is under significant pressure to overhaul its tests. The State Board of Regents has instructed CTB/McGraw-Hill, which develops the tests, to revamp the 2010 exams by testing a broader slice of the curriculum. The tests also will be given later in the year, in May, to allow classes to cover more ground. And state officials have said they plan to tinker with the scoring to make it harder for students to pass.
 In addition, the state's contract with CTB/McGraw-Hill ends next year, and some testing experts are suggesting that the state entirely reconfigure the test's design to better shield against score inflation. The company declined to comment, referring questions to the state.
 Merryl H. Tisch, the chancellor of the State Board of Regents, said she supported lifting the score required to pass because, she said, the tests had become too predictable. Federal exams, she noted, do not reflect the same gains in learning over the past several years that state English and math tests do. (Some attribute this to the fact that federal tests are not modeled on state standards, so students might be tested on skills they have not yet mastered.)
 ''We are painfully aware of the fact that our tests do not align with the national tests,'' she said. ''We need to align new standards with a new set of assessments that are rigorous and dependable.''
 Across grade levels, the percentage of points required to pass the math tests -- or ''meet learning standards'' -- has declined over the past three years. English tests have shown less significant decreases, and on fifth- and sixth-grade English tests, the cutoff score was in fact slightly higher this year than in 2006.
 Before a test is ready for students, it goes through several layers of vetting. Teachers and other educators comment on hundreds of questions drafted by the testing company. State officials choose the best ones and give field tests to thousands of children across the state, representing a range of abilities and various ethnic backgrounds. The children take the tests after their regular state exams and are told to give them their best effort, even though they do not count.
 After making sure the tests are not biased against specific ethnic groups or genders, testing experts draft an exam with a mix of easy and hard questions. If the questions, during the field testing stage, prove more difficult than the previous year's questions, the state reduces the number of correct answers needed to pass, thus ''standardizing'' it with previous tests. Conversely, if the new questions are easier, the cutoff is raised. 
 State officials said the increasing difficulty of the tests was the result of several factors. In 2006, after the results for the state math test came in, state officials determined the questions were mostly too easy, and so they sought to toughen certain areas in 2007. More recently, the questions that educators have recommended have tended to be harder, the officials said, though there was no intentional effort to increase the rigor.
 Critics say that the test-development process is prone to error, and that students are unlikely to take a field test seriously because it has no consequences. 
 Some have suggested adding questions to the tests that require students to show they know the material in different ways. For instance, a test might ask students to identify the theme of a fairy tale by reading several different passages and posing the question in several different ways, to make sure students have not just mastered the art of test-taking. 
 David M. Abrams, an assistant education commissioner, said the state was contemplating such a move. But he noted that outside testing experts had already validated the state's testing practices. 
 ''We have gone above and beyond the due diligence,'' he said.
 A side effect of the adjustments in scoring is that on 5 of the 12 math and English tests this year, a student had a better-than-even chance of earning a Level 2 mark-- a failing grade that reflects ''partially meeting learning standards'' -- simply by guessing. On the sixth-grade English test, for instance, a student had an 89 percent chance of reaching Level 2 this year by randomly guessing, according to an analysis by The New York Times.
 State officials disputed the importance of those findings, noting that students must earn a Level 3 to pass, and that the tests include decoy answers meant to dupe students intent on guessing.
 In the city, students must earn at least a Level 2 to move on to the next grade, but Mr. Abrams said the tests were never designed to be used to make those judgments.
 Jennifer Bell-Ellwanger, a senior New York City education official, defended the use of that benchmark, saying students who reached Level 2 had a better chance of academic success than those who scored worse on the test. She played down the guessing effect, saying decoy questions made it nearly impossible for a student to blindly reach Level 2.
 Daniel Koretz, a professor of education at Harvard, said that the guessing phenomenon was ''clearly a problem,'' and that it reflected a need for a test that more clearly distinguished between achievement levels.
 ''The public is being told that kids who hit Level 2 are doing substantively better than kids who are hitting Level 1,'' said Dr. Koretz, who served on a committee that advised the state on testing from 1996 to 2005. ''I think that's misleading.''
 Still, Mr. Abrams said he was not concerned about the distinctions between levels. He said the state tried to make the tests as difficult as possible, though he declined to say whether they had become too easy. 
 ''The tests are designed to determine if students are meeting the state standards,'' he said, ''and I believe we have been able to track that.''

HEADLINE: Welcome to Our Town. Wish We Weren't Here.

BYLINE: By SUSAN SAULNY

DATELINE: TREECE, Kan. 

 BODY:
Mayor Bill Blunk sees no reason for sugar-coating his opinion when asked to describe this town.
 ''It's dead,'' he said. ''Wasted land.'' 
 Almost anywhere else on the map, such bluntness could cost a politician re-election. But not here. Mr. Blunk has the near-unanimous support of the population, 140 people or so, who are perhaps singular among residents of municipalities in that they all want out of theirs. 
 ''I'd be happy to go as anyone,'' said Randall Barr, a retired sand company worker. ''You can't do anything with this land. What good is it?'' 
 For most of the early part of the 20th century, this little city in the southeast corner of Kansas had the feel of a rollicking boom town, its prosperity coming from land rich in lead, zinc and iron ore. Part of a vast mining district where Kansas, Missouri and Oklahoma meet, Treece and its twin city across the Oklahoma state line, Picher, became the unofficial capitals of a zone that in its heyday produced more than $20 billion worth of ore -- much of it used for weaponry to fight World Wars I and II. 
 But when the last of the mines closed in the 1970s, Treece was left sitting in a toxic waste dump of lead-tinged dust, contaminated soil and sinkholes. On a hot summer day, children can be seen riding their bikes around enormous mounds of chat -- pulverized rock laced with lead and iron. It is the waste product left over from mining that is the cause of so many problems here. Uncontrolled, it blows in the wind.
 Treece and Picher -- which is the much larger of the two towns, once home to 20,000 people and separated from Treece by only a gravel road, the state line -- became part of adjacent Superfund sites that the Environmental Protection Agency has been trying to clean since the 1980s.
 In Picher, the remediation of the land has proved daunting. In a move without many precedents, the federal government decided to buy out and relocate nearly the entire population, which had dwindled to 1,800 by 2000, leaving a dusty ghost town where the social and economic hub of the area used to be. 
 But the buyouts stopped at the Oklahoma line. Treece remains similarly contaminated, but now even more isolated. Officials in Kansas have been practically begging the federal government to move Treece's impoverished people, mostly the children and grandchildren of old miners, but to no avail.
 ''You can turn and see one block away is Oklahoma, unsafe,'' said Pam Pruitt, the city clerk. ''They got bought out, and we didn't? It's incredibly unfair. The people here, if they wanted to leave, they can't. They can't sell their property. They can't get bank loans to fix them up. They're just stuck.''
 The E.P.A. does not see it that way. The agency favors rehabilitation of the tainted soil in Treece, which mainly entails cleansing the top layer of sediment. 
 Senator Pat Roberts, Republican of Kansas and a staunch advocate of the buyouts, said he likened the strategy to ''throwing a fancy rug over a hole in the floor.'' He believes that it would be more efficient to simply move the people, which would cost an estimated $3.5 million. 
 Nonetheless, the agency says that it can accomplish the soil cleansing in 10 years and that Treece residents are safe in the meantime. In Picher, however, government scientists found that extensive waste deposits could not be remediated for several decades, and that residents would be at risk during the cleanup, hence the need for government-assisted relocation. 
 ''They are two independent sites from the way we look at it,'' said Mathy Stanislaus, the assistant administrator for solid waste at the E.P.A. 
 Mr. Stanislaus said that in Picher, the residential areas were interspersed with mining waste sites, but that in Treece, the residential areas were away from pollutants. Still, he said, the agency is ''taking a hard look'' at the residents' concerns and will continue to evaluate their situation. 
 Such explanations do nothing to ease the worry of the people in Treece. In addition to living in fear of lead and other poisons, they lost their stores, gas stations, some public services, jobs and their social outlet with the demise of Picher. 
 That town ceased to be an official entity on Sept. 1. Only a few die-hard residents remain, unconvinced of the health risks or unhappy with their buyout offers. 
 They live in a gothic landscape of varying degrees of disrepair. A few residents walked away from well-kept properties just last week, while most others took buyouts years ago, leaving dozens of houses to collapse upon themselves. Stray dogs wander. Faded signs announce places that are no longer: the Picher Mining Museum, the Church of the Nazarene, a 24-hour truck stop. 
 ''I had a perfectly good house,'' said Vickey Phillips, who moved out of Picher four years ago. ''But they said it was full of lead.'' 
 The psychological impact of Picher's move on Treece has been overwhelming. 
 ''They are in essence one town,'' said Senator Sam Brownback, Republican of Kansas, who grew up north of Treece and is pushing for the buyouts. ''Yes, there's a state line that divides them, but that's a man-made distinction. It is very much one town.''
 About 100 miles northeast of Tulsa, Treece is entirely residential, with the only public building being its two-room clapboard City Hall. Most of the population, which has a poverty level more than twice the national average, is feeling increasingly depressed about the isolation and a sense of creeping abandonment.
 ''There's nothing here but a City Hall, honestly,'' said Regina Palmer, 24.
 A 1993 study found that 34 percent of the children tested in Picher had blood lead levels exceeding the point at which there is a risk of brain or nervous system damage. Government efforts to do something to clean the chat piles began in earnest then. But similar studies have never been done in Treece.
 Only now is the E.P.A. testing the air quality and lead levels in residents' blood. Agency officials arrived in town last week.
 ''It's about 10 years too late,'' Mayor Blunk said. 
 Glenda Powell is among those hoping for a buyout. ''My father was one of the last miners,'' she said. ''He died of cancer, and so did my mom -- bad lungs. This has always been home, and I don't know where we'd go, just a place where we can breathe.''

HEADLINE: Tales From the Ranks of the Jobless

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Out of Work, and Too Down to Search On'' (front page, Sept. 7) struck a chord with me. I've been out of work since February, when the small newspaper I wrote for laid off half its newsroom. I started off feeling optimistic that I'd soon be on my feet, and I still spend between one and nine hours searching classified ads and Web sites, but it's getting more disheartening by the day.
 The worst thing, and what is less often mentioned, is the reaction I get from some of the still-employed. I've been told that my problem is that I'm not trying hard enough, or that I'm too picky. 
 Prolonged unemployment is a heavy enough burden on one's pride, but some days the added weight of the still-too-common social stigma it carries makes it a hard load to carry indeed.
 Matt DeBlass South Bound Brook, N.J., Sept. 7, 2009
 To the Editor:
 I was laid off in 2002 in the tech bust, and I couldn't move because my husband has a stable job. So I volunteered for the Democrats, focused on the teenager and waited for the economy to come back. I'm still waiting.
 Now, I'm one of the thousands applying for a handful of decent jobs, and my experience is almost worthless. I have three technical degrees and no interest in getting another. I'm not eligible for any kind of unemployment assistance.
 I'm getting a divorce. My income is zero, and I'll have to buy individual health insurance soon. I want work and I'm trying to find it. But with my resume, those offers aren't going to come.
 Where am I in all these government unemployment statistics?
 Sue Radford Fort Collins, Colo., Sept. 7, 2009
 To the Editor:
 There is yet another hidden sector of unemployed: freelancers.
 The trend of keeping small staffs and farming out other work has created a vast working class with no benefits and few rights.
 A freelancer whom I know worked for a company for nearly two years, then one day, just was not called in. No explanation.
 Many people who worked full time but were laid off will not apply for unemployment benefits because of the effect it might have as they now look for freelance jobs. In fields like graphic design, for example, workers feel they need to present an image of always being in demand, even during slow periods. You'll rarely find a designer who admits to a slow period, or to being unemployed.
 Jan Fisher Forest Hills, Queens, Sept. 7, 2009
 To the Editor:
 For frustrated job seekers, there is often a vicious cycle of negative attitudes negatively affecting interview outcomes. As a career consultant (and a woman in her 50s), I know that there are strategies that can help. 
 Usually, the first impression is one's resume, and it should be written so that it's easy for the hiring manager to see that you're qualified for that specific position. Each interview should be prepared for in detail, practicing aloud and focusing on appearance. 
 It's important for job seekers to get professional help early. Many states offer free assistance, like California's Employment Development Department, which sponsors groups in which job seekers collaborate, inviting professional speakers and helping one another. 
 Age discrimination exists, but often it's a perception that our thinking, behavior, level of energy and enthusiasm, and appearance may be out of date. This is something we can control.
 And for Rick Alexander, who in your article said that seeking a job was like asking that cheerleader for a date and being repeatedly rejected: choose your targets wisely. Apply only for positions for which you are qualified.
 Mauri Schwartz San Francisco, Sept. 7, 2009
 To the Editor:
 One job seeker in your article, Ray Rucker, age 62, said that when he was being interviewed for a job with a retail chain, he was asked how soon he planned to retire. I find that discriminatory under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. If I had been in Mr. Rucker's place, I would have asked (diplomatically) whether the executive was referring to my age. This might have led to an open discussion about the issue. 
 For example, older workers are more stable and reliable and don't engage in job-jumping.

NEW YORK ON LESS:
 Towers on Hold,
 But Not Night Life
 Call it the condo and cocktail district.
 Perhaps no other community board district in Manhattan toasted the real estate boom with a higher concentration of new towers and clubs and bars than the district overseen by Community Board 4. 
 Hotels of all types appeared in the district -- which includes Chelsea and Hell's Kitchen -- from luxury boutiques to bargain-basement chains catering to Thanksgiving Day Parade marching bands.
 So in the boom years, Robert J. Benfatto Jr., the district manager, spent his days fielding requests for zoning changes from developers and answering noise complaints from residents about revelers pouring out of clubs. 
 But even in the recession, Mr. Benfatto has seen some signs that the party has not stopped. He has added another committee to handle the many applications from new bars and restaurants. He expects that the noise complaints will continue with the planned opening of the club Avenue and the proposed reopening of the Roxy.
 But the recession halted many projects: The district has become a collection of unsightly parking lots and half-finished buildings. Even the view from Mr. Benfatto's office, on 42nd Street near Eighth Avenue, is of a stalled construction site on 39th Street. He talked recently about the state of his district.
 Q. What kind of complaints have you received lately? 
 A. There was a lot of construction and development going on. Now there's none. There's a lot of holes in the ground. When you leave those unattended for a while, kids knock down fences and go in there. People sleep in there. We get these calls from constituents: ''There's people sleeping in such an area, or kids congregating there.''
 Q. Have some neighborhoods been affected more than others?
 A. Probably Hell's Kitchen has been affected more than Chelsea, because Chelsea had a lot economically going for it: the High Line, the clubs, the galleries. Hell's Kitchen tries to maintain an urban village way about it. It still has some small businesses there. 
 Q. Why are so many restaurants still opening as the buildings around them remain unfinished or empty?
 A. It's like death and birth. As one thing goes, another thing comes back. CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY

HEADLINE: Life Insurers' Perspective

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''New Exotic Investments Emerging on Wall Street'' (front page, Sept. 6): 
 Securitization of life insurance policies transferred to third parties is not necessarily a bad thing. But these investments can turn bad unless consumers purchased the policies in good faith and with a legitimate insurable interest present at the time of issue. 
 Life insurers' concern is with fraudulent transactions in which policies are purchased solely for the purpose of reselling them to investors, called stranger-originated life insurance, or Stoli. A high probability exists that in order to create a sufficient inventory of policies to make securitization economically feasible, seniors will be induced to participate in Stoli fraud. 
 If Stoli-related policies are included in investment packages and these policies are later rescinded for lack of an insurable interest, the harm to investors could be significant. 
 Legislation to combat Stoli and establish new consumer protections has been enacted in 25 states and is pending in 14 others. Insurers will continue to work for the strongest possible legislation in every jurisdiction. 
 Frank Keating Washington, Sept. 9, 2009
 The writer, a former governor of Oklahoma, is president of the American Council of Life Insurers.

HEADLINE: After Safe Exit, A Journalist Returns

BYLINE: By DAVID CARR. 
E-mail: carr@nytimes.com; http://twitter.com/carr2n

 BODY:
Back in February 2008, Thomas Moran, then the politics columnist for The Star-Ledger of Newark, surveyed the brushfire overtaking newspapers and decided it was time to leave the building. With two children approaching college and a spouse, Mary Jo Layton, who also worked in journalism, at The Record of Hackensack, N.J., he decided to take a nice offer from PSEG, a holding company that includes the public utility Public Service Electric and Gas, as a policy director.
 It made a terrific amount of sense. You can't get more stable than a power company, and Mr. Moran's newspaper would soon lay off 40 percent of its staff. It wasn't that he had lost his taste for the work -- his editor, Jim Willse, called New Jersey a ''game preserve'' of political corruption -- it just seemed that after an 11-year run at the newspaper, it was time to grow up and get a real job. His friends both inside and outside the newspaper congratulated him on his good fortune, and the trouble in the business since has only reinforced the brilliance of his market timing. 
 Sitting at the Tick Tock Diner in Clifton, N.J., on Friday morning over an egg-white omelet -- at 52, he is careful about many things, including what he eats -- Mr. Moran said it seemed like a straightforward decision at the time.
 ''We were in our third year of pay freezes, and I have two kids who are going to want to go to college, so it seemed like a pretty clear message that it was time to move on,'' he said.
 But the security of a good job representing the interests of a large corporation clanked against his nature almost immediately. 
 ''I knew after a week it wouldn't work,'' he said.
 Mr. Moran lives in Montclair, N.J., a town lousy with other journalists, including me. At neighborhood gatherings, we couldn't help but notice that the once lively and mouthy Mr. Moran was bringing a dark cloud with him wherever he went. But at a party a week ago, Mr. Moran was back to talking smack about politics and spraying news in all directions, including the fact that he would be heading back into the burning building that is modern journalism.
 Friday was Mr. Moran's last day at PSEG. His opinions will now be shared more broadly because he will be covering the governor's race as, yes, the political columnist for The Star-Ledger. His first column will appear this week, he said, looking out the window of the Tick Tock, a famed diner where back in 2000 a junior Mafioso decided to cooperate with the government after he was told to step outside and wait for a van. ''A van is never a good sign in this business,'' he said, hinting at the mayhem that might take place in a windowless vehicle. You can't make this stuff up, which is part of the reason Mr. Moran wants back in.
 ''There is no job security, and it could all blow up in a year,'' he said, smiling and taking a sip from his half-decaf coffee. ''But I now have a front-row seat on the spectacle of New Jersey politics.''
 It is hard to overstate the spectacle. In July, the feds needed buses to haul away all the suspects in a huge government corruption investigation including two mayors, several council members and some bureaucrats.
 ''And rabbis, don't forget the rabbis,'' Mr. Moran reminded cheerfully. ''And there were allegations of body parts being sold as well.''
 For 18 months, Mr. Moran's nose was pressed against the glass of his nicely appointed 10th floor corporate office in Newark, watching the world go by, mostly without him. Now he is back on the street.
 Many of the same friends who congratulated him on getting out of journalism now wonder if he has lost his mind. A few asked if he was joking.
 ''Look, I no longer have to collaborate with 15 people on a plan to go to the bathroom. PSEG is a very successful company. They know what they are doing. But big companies are by nature hierarchal and cautious. If I want to walk into my editor's office and tell him I think he's a bozo, I can.''
 For the record, his editor does not think Mr. Moran is a bozo for returning.
 ''We had talked a fair amount after he left, and it was clear that if the right shot came along, he would welcome the opportunity to get back in the newsroom,'' Mr. Willse said. ''We are missing a lot after last year's departures, but one of the bigger things we were missing was a political columnist during a very overheated gubernatorial race. Among other things, Tom is a very good reporter, and by having somebody with their antennae up, it's clear we are going to get stuff we aren't getting now.''
 Journalists, for all their self-importance, are often a little naive about the way the real world works. Sure, being a newsie is a grind, the hours are not great and the public holds us in lower esteem than the women who work the poles at Satin Dolls down the road from the Tick Tock in Lodi, but it beats working by a mile. Every day is a caper, and most reporters are attention-deprived adrenaline junkies who care only for the next story. Journalists are like cops, hugging the job close and savoring the rest of their life as they can.
 The skills of finding out what is not known and rendering it in comprehensible ways has practical value in other parts of the economy, but the thrill of this thing of ours is not a moveable feast. The difference between a reporting job and other jobs is the difference between working for The Man and being The Man, a legend, at least, in your own mind
 Mr. Moran, who made his decision to leave journalism partly as a way of looking after his kids -- Patrick, 15, Gracie, 12 -- realized he was setting a bad example. ''You should do what you love, and I don't think they enjoyed living with me moping around because I was miserable,'' he said, adding, ''I mean, what was I going to do for fun-- take up cooking and model trains?''

HEADLINE: Q & A with Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
Q: (Reader)
 Who's the actress in all those commercials for Progressive insurance? She plays the sassy sales clerk.
 A: (Stuart Elliott)
 The actress in the campaign for the Progressive Corporation, playing Flo the clerk, is a comedian named Stephanie Courtney. The campaign, which is created by the Arnold Worldwide division of Havas, has gained fans as it has gone along, judging by Facebook, fan pages and message boards. Although some people consider her annoying, most others say they like her breezy personality.
 In an article last week about the campaign on the Cleveland.com Web site, Progressive said that people had called the company asking to buy insurance directly from Flo. Can Geico say the same about its gecko or cavemen? 
 Q: (Reader)
 I read your response to a question last week about Duane Reade's new bag design.
 My question is why did Duane Reade shift its marketing and merchandising strategy from great values to regular, ho-hum pricing promoted with even more ho-hum storefront windows?
 Duane Reade's shift from killer pricing on everyday staples of health and beauty aids seems to have produced stores in my Midtown East neighborhood that generally seem empty -- not to mention that the formerly ubiquitous Duane Reade shopping bags are no longer part of New York City's streetscape.
 Several years ago after Duane Reade's change in management and resultant new marketing strategy, I switched from my weekly Duane Reade shopping hits to Rite Aid, until the Rite Aid around the corner from me on 51st Street and Second Avenue was hit by a crane and never reopened.
 Since then I've discovered Costco in Melville, N.Y. Now I make monthly trips and spend $200 to $400 each trip buying the stuff I used to buy at Duane Reade. Now I wish I had saved my old Duane Reade bags so I could use them when I check out at Costco.
 A: (Stuart Elliott)
 Thanks, dear reader, for your observations. As a consumer who considers shopping a competitive sport, I have noticed that despite the recession, Duane Reade's prices have climbed lately. For instance, 1.5-liter bottles of Coca-Cola soft drinks, which were once $1.19 or so, have jumped to $1.79 or $1.89.
 Even the prices of items on sale in the weekly Duane Reade circulars have increased. Those sodas, which were usually 99 cents or $1.09 when on sale, have gone up to 4 for $5 -- and they go on sale much less often than before. Same, too, with Colgate toothpaste, previously $2 or $2.50 on sale, now more like 2 for $6.
 My guess as to why this happened is that it stems from a change of ownership at Duane Reade in 2004, when the drugstore chain was sold in a leveraged buyout to a private equity firm, Robert Bass's Oak Hill Capital Partners. The New York Post reported that Oak Hill recently injected $125 million into Duane Reade to keep it from defaulting on its debt and start a turnaround. With cash scarce, revenue needs to increase, meaning great values may have become a luxury.
 As for the windows, they were quite cluttered before the redesign began, and at some stores, they went unchanged for weeks on end, resulting in a sore sight for eyes. Better some ho-hum windows than windows that looked as if the stores had been closed for renovations that never took place.

HEADLINE: Ex-Mayor of Memphis Starts Bid for Congress, Invoking Race in Campaign

BYLINE: By ROBBIE BROWN

DATELINE: MEMPHIS 

 BODY:
A Congressional race in Tennessee has become freighted with racial overtones almost a year before the election, with a prominent black politician saying the white incumbent cannot properly represent black voters.
 The black candidate, former Mayor Willie W. Herenton of Memphis, has argued that Tennessee needs a black voice in its currently all-white delegation. He is running a blistering campaign against Representative Steve Cohen, a fellow Democrat with a precarious hold on the majority black district.
 ''To know Steve Cohen is to know that he really does not think very much of African-Americans,'' Mr. Herenton said in a recent radio interview on KWAM. ''He's played the black community well.'' 
 The primary election in August 2010 pits an unlikely officeholder -- a Jew in a deeply Christian region, a middle-age white man known for fighting for blacks and women -- against a prominent challenger. Already, the campaign has proved how deeply race still infuses much of politics in the South, even after the election of a black president.
 The candidates are battling to represent the Ninth Congressional District, a low-income area that envelops Memphis and is more than 60 percent black. The district was redrawn and renumbered in 1973, increasing the percentage of minority voters, and for three decades it elected the state's only black members of Congress since Reconstruction, Harold E. Ford Sr. and his son Harold E. Ford Jr.
 But in 2006, Mr. Cohen defeated a divided field of black candidates. He coasted to re-election last year against a little-known black corporate lawyer. 
 The Herenton campaign argues that Mr. Cohen is an anomaly.
 ''This seat was set aside for people who look like me,'' said Mr. Herenton's campaign manager, Sidney Chism, a black county commissioner. ''It wasn't set aside for a Jew or a Christian. It was set aside so that blacks could have representation.''
 Mr. Cohen, 60, is a well-known Memphis liberal who considered joining the Congressional Black Caucus, wrote a national apology for slavery and the Jim Crow laws, and received an ''A'' rating from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. 
 ''I vote like a 45-year-old black woman,'' he said in an interview. ''I don't know the black experience, but I know about being a minority and being discriminated against because of religion.''
 But his unusual identity -- as one of only two white members of Congress from majority black districts -- makes him vulnerable politically. In the last election, his opponent ran a much-vilified advertisement that tried to link Mr. Cohen to the Ku Klux Klan. It juxtaposed Mr. Cohen with an image of a hooded Klansman and criticized him for voting not to rename a state park currently named for a Klan founder, Nathan Bedford Forrest. 
 Political experts say the coming primary may be the closest and most combative yet in the district. In the heavily Democratic district, Republicans have little chance of winning the seat. Mr. Herenton, 69, a former Golden Gloves boxer, holds great sway in Memphis. He rose from segregated south Memphis to become the first black elected mayor, in 1991, and was re-elected a record four times. 
 ''If Herenton runs a strong campaign and Cohen makes a slip or two, he could lose,'' said Marcus D. Pohlmann, a political scientist at Rhodes College in Memphis. Mr. Herenton, he said, is ''a very strong campaigner, and he's proven that he has resonance with a significant portion of the African-American community.''
 Still, Mr. Herenton's political capital has diminished recently. Twice he announced that he was retiring, then changed his mind or rescheduled the departure date. Then, after resigning this summer, he considered running again because he disapproved of his successor. He has since changed his mind and is focusing on the Congressional race.
 He also faces potential legal problems. For more than a year, a grand jury has been investigating accusations that Mr. Herenton benefited from his private real estate business while mayor. His real estate company allegedly received $91,000 in 2006 for the development of a downtown Greyhound station that he supported. He has denied wrongdoing in the case.
 Mr. Herenton could not be reached for comment for this article, but he has lashed out at Mr. Cohen in local news interviews. He has referred to Mr. Cohen by a vulgar term to a newspaper reporter and has argued that Mr. Cohen is privately demeaning to blacks. Mr. Herenton claims that Mr. Cohen made personally derisive, racially insensitive remarks to him during a recent airplane flight -- an accusation that Mr. Cohen denies. 
 ''This Congressional race, you know what it's going to be about?'' Mr. Herenton said in a radio interview. ''It's going to be about race, representation and power.'' 
 Black voters in the district are divided by this argument. The Rev. Ralph White, a black minister at the Bloomfield Full Gospel Baptist Church in Memphis, said congregants were still choosing their candidates. 
 ''There are those who come up to me and say, 'Even though I love Steve, this is a very important seat to the African-American community,' '' Mr. White said. ''It's a very sticky, touchy situation.''
 Across town, a group of white Cohen supporters calling themselves Drinking Liberally met at a college bar one night and denounced Mr. Herenton's tactics. ''It's not supposed to be about who embodies the characteristics of the district,'' said Regina Morrison Newman, a lawyer. ''You have to serve your constituents.''
 Ultimately, said David A. Bositis, a senior analyst at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies in Washington, the election is about whether a long-shot candidate can continue to defy the odds. 
 ''Anyone really looking at Cohen's previous elections would have to conclude that he has lucked out,'' Mr. Bositis said. ''This will be by far his hardest election yet.''

CORRECTION-DATE: September 15, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An article on Monday about a Congressional race in Tennessee included several errors. The Congressional district, the Ninth, had its boundaries redrawn before the 1972 elections, not in 1973. The incumbent, Steve Cohen, said of his record in Congress, ''I vote like a black woman,'' not ''I vote like a 45-year-old black woman.'' And a park named for a Klan founder, Nathan Bedford Forrest, that Mr. Cohen voted not to rename is a city park, not a state park. (There is a state park by the same name.)

HEADLINE: China Moves To Beat Back A Tire Tariff

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: HONG KONG 

 BODY:
China unexpectedly increased pressure Sunday on the United States in a widening trade dispute, taking the first steps toward imposing tariffs on American exports of automotive products and chicken meat in retaliation for President Obama's decision late Friday to levy tariffs on tires from China. 
 The Chinese government's strong countermove followed a weekend of nationalistic vitriol against the United States on Chinese Web sites in response to the tire tariff. ''The U.S. is shameless!'' said one posting, while another called on the Chinese government to sell all of its huge holdings of Treasury bonds.
 The impact of the dispute extends well beyond tires, chickens and cars. Both governments are facing domestic pressure to take a tougher stand against the other on economic issues. But the trade battle increases political tensions between the two nations even as they try to work together to revive the global economy and combat mutual security threats, like the nuclear ambitions of Iran and North Korea. 
 Mr. Obama's decision to impose a tariff of up to 35 percent on Chinese tires is a signal that he plans to deliver on his promise to labor unions that he would more strictly enforce trade laws, especially against China, which has become the world's factory while the United States has lost millions of manufacturing jobs. The trade deficit with China was a record $268 billion in 2008. 
 China had initially issued a fairly formulaic criticism of the tire dispute Saturday. But rising nationalism in China is making it harder for Chinese officials to gloss over American criticism.
 ''All kinds of policymaking, not just trade policy, is increasingly reactive to Internet opinion,'' said Victor Shih, a Northwestern University specialist in economic policy formulation. 
 Eswar Prasad, a former China division chief at the International Monetary Fund, said that rising trade tensions between the United States and China could become hard to control. They could cloud the Group of 20 meeting of leaders of industrialized and fast-growing emerging nations in Pittsburgh on Sept. 24 and 25, and perhaps affect Mr. Obama's visit to Beijing in November.
 ''This spat about tires and chickens could turn ugly very quickly,'' Mr. Prasad said.
 China exported $1.3 billion in tires to the United States in the first seven months of 2009, while the United States shipped about $800 million in automotive products and $376 million in chicken meat to China, according to data from Global Trade Information Services in Columbia, S.C. 
 For many years, American politicians have been able to take credit domestically for standing up to China by taking largely symbolic measures against Chinese exports in narrowly defined categories. In the last five years, the Commerce Department has restricted Chinese imports of goods as diverse as bras and oil well equipment.
 For the most part, Chinese officials have grumbled but done little, preferring to preserve a trade relationship in which the United States buys $4.46 worth of Chinese goods for every $1 worth of American goods sold to China.
 Now, the delicate equilibrium is being disturbed. 
 China's commerce ministry announced Sunday that it would investigate ''certain imported automotive products and certain imported chicken meat products originating from the United States'' to determine if they were being subsidized or ''dumped'' below cost in the Chinese market. A finding of subsidies or dumping would allow China to impose tariffs on these imports.
 The ministry did not mention the tire dispute in its announcement, portraying the investigations as ''based on the laws of our country and on World Trade Organization rules.''
 But the timing of the announcement -- on a weekend and just after the tire decision in Washington -- sent an unmistakable message of retaliation. The official Xinhua news agency Web site prominently linked its reports on the tire dispute and the Chinese investigations.
 The commerce ministry statement, posted on its Web site, also hinted obliquely at the harm that a trade war could do while Western nations and Japan struggle to emerge from a severe economic downturn. ''China is willing to continue efforts with various countries to make sure that the world economy recovers as quickly as possible,'' the statement said.
 The Chinese government sometimes organizes blog postings to defend its own policies. But some postings on the tire decision have been implicitly critical of the Chinese government, making it unlikely that they are part of an orchestrated effort.
 ''Why did our government purchase so much U.S. government debt?'' said one posting signed by a ''Group of Angry Youths.'' It continued, ''We should get rid of all such U.S. investments.''
 China has accumulated $2 trillion in foreign reserves, mostly in Treasury bonds and other dollar-denominated assets, and held down the value of its currency, which has kept Chinese goods quite inexpensive in foreign markets. China's exports have soared -- China surpassed Germany in the first half of this year as the world's largest exporter -- while China's imports have lagged, except for commodities like iron ore and oil that China lacks.
 Worries that China might sell Treasury bonds -- or even slow down its purchases of them -- have been a concern for the Bush and Obama administrations as they have tried to figure out how to address China's trade and currency policies.
 At the same time, the Chinese economy relies heavily on exports to the United States, while the American economy is much less dependent on exports in the other direction. Exports to the United States, at 6 percent of China's entire economic output, account for 13 times as large a share of the Chinese economy as exports to China represent for the United States economy.
 Carol J. Guthrie, a spokeswoman for the Office of the United States trade representative, said that the United States wanted to avoid disputes with China and continue talks, but would look at any Chinese trade decisions for whether they comply with W.T.O. rules.
 Products involved in trade disputes between the United States and China together make up only a minuscule sliver of the two countries' trade relationship.
 The bigger risk for China, economists and corporate executives have periodically warned, is that trade frictions could cause multinationals to rethink their heavy reliance on Chinese factories in their supply chains. The Chinese targeting of autos and chickens affects two industries that may have the political muscle in the United States to dissuade the Obama administration from aggressively challenging China's policies.
 General Motors sees much of its growth coming from its China subsidiary, the second-largest auto company in China after Volkswagen. And the farm lobby in the United States has long pressed for maximum access to a market of 1.3 billion mouths.
 But spotlighting automotive trade may be risky for China. G.M. and Ford both rely mostly on local production to supply the Chinese market, while China is rapidly increasing auto parts shipments to the United States.

HEADLINE: If Medicaid Covers More Poor Patients, Who Covers Cost?

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

 BODY:
SENATOR Max Baucus, the Montana Democrat who is leading the effort to develop bipartisan health care legislation, plans this week to unveil his ''mark'' -- the proposal to be taken up by the Senate Finance Committee, of which he is chairman. 
 Reaction to his plan could finally reveal whether the ''bipartisan six'' subgroup that Mr. Baucus has been working with for months will stick together or whether Democrats will head off largely on their own. 
 The big question marks are two Republicans, Senators Charles E. Grassley of Iowa and Michael B. Enzi of Wyoming. The third Republican, Senator Olympia J. Snowe of Maine, has sounded more upbeat about achieving a compromise. 
 Mr. Grassley and Mr. Enzi have good reason to avoid showing their cards. If it becomes clear that they will not vote for the bill, Democrats will probably respond by dumping provisions that Mr. Enzi and Mr. Grassley won during negotiations. 
 Even if the group of six hangs together, the broader 23-member Finance Committee will almost certainly end up fighting over a crucial component of the health care bill: a proposed expansion of Medicaid, a topic that often divides lawmakers more by geography than by party. 
 Expanding Medicaid, the state-federal insurance program for the poor, has been a major issue in recent days as Mr. Baucus moved to finish his plan. Ms. Snowe, whose vote is crucial, has said it tops her list of concerns.
 And for many members of Congress, as well as for governors and state legislators around the country, Medicaid expansion is even more important than issues like the ''public option'' or illegal immigrants that have tended to get far more publicity. 
 EASY, IN PRINCIPLE Deciding to expand Medicaid is something of a no-brainer. After all, a central problem with the current system is that insurance is expensive and the people who lack insurance are predominantly poor. Medicaid already covers about 60 million Americans. 
 But while expanding Medicaid would be a relatively cost-effective way to reduce the number of uninsured, it would still be expensive. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that Medicaid provisions in the House legislation would cost $438 billion over 10 years.
 Although Mr. Baucus is proposing to spend less than that, he has said that a part of the cost must be borne by the states. So while President Obama is intent on a national approach to revamping health care, members of Congress must also consider their local interests.
 That is what makes the Medicaid dispute so tricky, especially when so many state budgets have been sapped by the recession.
 AS GOES MAINE ... Ms. Snowe is particularly concerned about how much additional federal aid will go to states like hers that already offer relatively broad eligibility, because such states will most likely get less new federal money than states with tighter Medicaid restrictions. 
 The House legislation, as well as a Senate framework released by Mr. Baucus, calls for raising the income eligibility threshold for Medicaid to 133 percent of the federal poverty level -- a figure that for 2009 translates to about $14,400 for an individual. 
 A big change is that childless adults under age 65 who are now typically excluded from Medicaid will be eligible. So will many parents who now often face tighter restrictions.
 Currently, states must offer Medicaid to pregnant women and to children under age 6 from families with income under 133 percent of the poverty level. States must also offer coverage to children age 6 to 18 from families with income below the poverty line.
 And though many states have set higher thresholds for children, typically at more than 200 percent of poverty, many parents of these children do not have coverage. Only 11 states cover parents earning more than 133 percent of poverty.
 Experts estimate that roughly one-third of Americans who currently lack insurance earn less than 133 percent of the poverty limit -- a group of 10 million people who might join Medicare under the proposed new rules.
 QUESTIONS OF FAIRNESS The House legislation initially called on the federal government to pick up the entire cost of the Medicaid expansion. But under recent revisions the states would have to pay 10 percent of the cost after the first five years.
 In the Senate, Mr. Baucus has said there must be some ''shared responsibility'' between the states and the federal government. But he has not yet set a final number. And when he does, lawmakers are certain to fight over it.
 Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, has warned that her state could face $2 billion a year in additional costs. Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, has said states should not be punished for having spent more Medicaid in the past. 
 Ms. Snowe, appearing Sunday on ''Face the Nation'' on CBS, pointed out that Maine is one of just a few states that already offer Medicaid to some childless adults. ''It would be unfair,'' she said, ''to penalize states that are doing the right thing already.''

HEADLINE: U.S. IS FINDING ROLE IN BUSINESS HARD TO UNWIND

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS and DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
When President Obama travels to Wall Street on Monday to speak from Federal Hall, where the founders once argued bitterly over how much the government should control the national economy, he is likely to cast himself as a ''reluctant shareholder'' in America's biggest industries and financial institutions. 
 But one year after the collapse of Lehman Brothers set off a series of federal interventions, the government is the nation's biggest lender, insurer, automaker and guarantor against risk for investors large and small. 
 Between financial rescue missions and the economic stimulus program, government spending accounts for a bigger share of the nation's economy -- 26 percent -- than at any time since World War II. The government is financing 9 out of 10 new mortgages in the United States. If you buy a car from General Motors, you are buying from a company that is 60 percent owned by the government. 
 If you take out a car loan or run up your credit card, the chances are good that the government is financing both your debt and that of your bank. 
 And if you buy life insurance from the American International Group, you will be buying from a company that is almost 80 percent federally owned.
 Mr. Obama plans to argue, his aides say, that these government intrusions will be temporary. At the same time, however, he will push hard for an increased government role in overseeing the financial system to prevent a repeat of the excesses that caused the crisis.
 ''These were extraordinary provisions of support, not part of a permanent program,'' said Lawrence H. Summers, director of the National Economic Council at the White House. ''You're seeing a process of exit every day. It's a process that's going to take quite some time, but the prospects are much brighter today than they were nine months ago.''
 That process unfolds every day in a bland bureaucrat's haven, an annex connected by an underground tunnel to the Treasury's main building on Pennsylvania Avenue. There, about 200 civil servants -- accountants, lawyers, former investment bankers -- oversee the $700 billion program that pumps taxpayer money into banks, insurance companies and two of Detroit's Big Three auto companies. 
 In the main Treasury building, senior officials hold veto power over executive pay packages for the biggest recipients of government loans, like Citigroup and Bank of America. A separate group, working closely with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, oversees the multibillion-dollar bailout of American International Group. Ten blocks away, at the Federal Reserve, officials are still providing the emergency liquidity that keeps a battered economy moving.
 To Mr. Obama's critics, thousands of whom took to the streets of Washington this weekend to protest a new era of big government, all these efforts are part of a plan to dismantle free-market capitalism. On the ground it looks quite different, as a new president and his team try to define the proper role, both as owners and regulators. 
 A Light Hand on the Reins
 Far from eagerly micromanaging the companies the government owns, Mr. Obama and his economic team have often labored mightily to avoid exercising control even when government money was the only thing keeping some companies afloat.
 A few weeks ago, there were anguished grimaces inside the Treasury Department as the new chief executive of A.I.G., Robert H. Benmosche, whose roughly $9 million pay package is 22 times greater than Mr. Obama's, ridiculed officials in Washington -- his majority shareholders -- as ''crazies.'' 
 Causing even more unease to policymakers, Mr. Benmosche insisted that A.I.G. -- one of the worst offenders in the risk-taking that sent the nation over the edge last year -- would not rush to sell its businesses at fire-sale prices, despite pressure from Fed and Treasury officials, who are desperate to have the insurer repay its $180 billion government bailout. 
 But in the end, according to one senior official, ''no one called him and told him to shut up,'' and no one has pulled rank and told him to sell assets as soon as possible to repay the loans.
 A similar hands-off decision was made about the auto companies. Shortly after General Motors and Chrysler emerged from bankruptcy, some members of the administration's auto task force argued that the group should not go out of business until it was confident that a new management team in Detroit had a handle on what needed to be done. 
 But Mr. Summers strongly rejected that approach, and the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, agreed. 
 ''The argument was that if the president said he wasn't elected to run G.M., then we couldn't hire a new board and then try to run any aspect of it,'' one participant in the discussions said. The auto task force took off for summer vacation in July, and it never returned.
 But it will probably be several years before the government can begin to sell its stake in G.M. back to the public, and even then, according a report issued last week by the independent monitor of the Troubled Asset Relief Program, some of the $20 billion or so funneled to G.M. and Chrysler is probably gone forever.
 Winding Down Programs
 By contrast, Mr. Obama's team and the Federal Reserve have been more successful than generally recognized at winding down many of the support programs for banks. Nearly three dozen financial institutions have repaid $70 billion in loans to the Treasury, and officials predict that $50 billion more will be repaid over the next 18 months. Indeed, the government has earned tidy profit on the first round of repayments. 
 One of the biggest backstops has been the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which now guarantees about $300 billion worth of bonds issued by banks. 
 The volume of new guarantees has declined to less than $5 billion a month in August from more than $90 billion a month earlier this year. The F.D.I.C. announced last week that it would either end the program entirely on Oct. 31 or reduce it further by substantially increasing the fees that banks have to pay. 
 Similarly, one of the Fed's biggest emergency loan programs, the Term Auction Facility, has shrunk by more than half in the last 12 months. A second big program, which finances short-term i.o.u.'s for businesses, has shrunk to $124 billion, from $332 billion a year ago. 
 Obama administration officials bristle at even the hint that their rescue measures have ushered in a new era of ''big government.'' 
 But supporters and critics alike worry that it will be difficult to shrink the government to anything like its former role. For one thing, Mr. Obama is determined to expand government regulation of business and to beef up federal protections for consumers.
 Seeking More Oversight
 Mr. Obama's proposals to overhaul the system of financial regulation would give the Fed new powers to supervise giant financial institutions whose failure could threaten the entire financial system. 
 To limit the dangers posed by insolvent institutions that are ''too big to fail,'' the F.D.I.C. would receive new authority to close them in an orderly way. 
 The administration would impose much tougher regulation over the vast market for financial derivatives like credit-default swaps and other exotic instruments for hedging risk. 
 It would also create an entirely new Consumer Financial Protection Agency, which would have broad power to regulate most forms of consumer lending. 
 In his speech on Monday, White House officials say, Mr. Obama will step up pressure on Wall Street to accept tougher oversight. Eventhough his proposals have made little headway in Congress, largely because of the battle over health care, Democratic lawmakers said they were determined to pass comprehensive legislation by next year.
 ''Big government now is the consequence of too little government before,'' said Representative Barney Frank, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee. ''What you have right now, with the government owning companies, is the result of insufficient regulation before.'' 
 On a practical level, experts say it will take years for the government to unwind some of its rescue programs. 
 Thanks to the mortgage crisis and the collapse in housing prices, private investors have fled the mortgage market, and the federal government now finances about 9 out of 10 new home loans in the United States.
 The Treasury took over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored finance companies that own or have guaranteed more than $5 trillion in mortgages, in the first week of September 2008. Fannie and Freddie now buy or guarantee almost two-thirds of all new mortgages. The Federal Housing Administration guarantees another 25 percent. 
 The cost of keeping the two giant companies afloat has been huge. The Treasury has provided Fannie and Freddie with $95 billion to cover losses tied to soaring default rates and losses in value on their own mortgage portfolios. Analysts predict that the companies will need considerably more in the year ahead. At the same time, the Fed is buying almost all the new mortgage-backed securities issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the F.H.A. Buying up those securities drives up their price and pushes down their effective interest rates, and ultimately lowers borrowing costs to homebuyers. 
 An Enormous Scale
 The scale of the Fed's intervention has been staggering. The central bank has acquired more than $700 billion in mortgage-backed securities so far, and officials have said they will buy up to $1.25 trillion -- a goal that should take the Fed until early next year. To help Fannie and Freddie raise the money they need to buy mortgages from lenders, the Fed is also buying $200 billion of their bonds.
 All told, the government is propping up almost the entire mortgage market and, by extension, the housing industry.
 As the government backs away from its rescue operations, economists and others worry about unknown consequences. Some analysts are already predicting that mortgage rates will bump higher when the Fed stops buying mortgage securities, potentially delaying a recovery in housing. 
 But the much bigger puzzle is how the government will untangle Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, with their combustible mix of taxpayer support, public policy goals and for-profit structures.
 ''It will be very difficult to unwind, having stepped in as big as they did,'' said Howard Glaser, a senior housing official during the Clinton administration and now an industry consultant in Washington. ''There is no structure, no mechanism, for private investors to come back into the market.''
 Other experts and policy makers have begun to raise broader concerns. Even if the Obama administration and the Fed do manage to shrink the government's role to precrisis levels, has the government's immense rescue simply set the stage for more frequent interventions in the future?
 ''This crisis, whether it's because of the Fed or the Treasury or Congress, has created a lot of new moral hazards,'' said Charles I. Plosser, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. ''Once you have done this once, even though it was in a severe crisis, the temptation will be for people to figure that in the next crisis you'll do it again. You've got to figure out a way to say no.''

HEADLINE: 'Avenue Q' Won't Close, Moving Off But Not Out

BYLINE: By DAVE ITZKOFF

 BODY:
''Avenue Q,'' the satirical Broadway puppet musical that was to close after its Sunday performance won't be shutting down after all. Instead it will transfer to an Off Broadway theater.
 In June it was announced that ''Avenue Q,'' an adult takeoff of children's shows like ''Sesame Street,'' would close at the Golden Theater. But at what was to be its final performance, Kevin McCollum, the lead producer, said that ''Avenue Q,'' which in 2004 won the Tony Award for best musical, would move to New World Stages in Clinton, where it would resume performances on Oct. 9. 
 In a telephone interview Mr. McCollum said that a transfer of ''Avenue Q'' had been contemplated as far back as February, when ticket sales for the show dipped briefly below the minimum that it guaranteed the Golden Theater. In recent weeks, Mr. McCollum said, he and fellow producers Robyn Goodman and Jeffrey Seller had begun to gravitate to New World Stages, where offbeat fare like ''The Gazillion Bubble Show'' and ''The Toxic Avenger'' had thrived. The deal with New World Stages was signed on Sunday, and Mr. McCollum officially revealed it that night to the ''Avenue Q'' performers, crew and audience members in an onstage speech. 
 Robert Lopez, who is a creator and composer of ''Avenue Q'' with Jeff Marx, said in a telephone interview that he had learned of the transfer last week. 
 He said he suspected though that other people in attendance on Sunday may have known that the announcement was coming. ''There's a line in the show about downsizing,'' Mr. Lopez said, ''and I could tell there were about 50 people that laughed in the audience, so I figured they knew the secret.''
 Mr. Lopez added that Mr. McCollum had asked him to compose a novelty song about the ''Avenue Q'' transfer to be performed at Sunday's announcement. ''I think I was able to convince him that it would have seemed too planned,'' Mr. Lopez said. 
 The move from the Golden, which seats about 800 people, to New World Stages, where ''Avenue Q'' will play to about 500 people a show, and where the top ticket price will be reduced to $86.50 from about $110, will result in some cost savings for the production. Mr. McCollum said its capitalization would be reduced to between $800,000 and $1 million, from about $3.5 million for the Broadway run (which had been earned back). And weekly advertising costs, he said, would be lowered to about $10,000 from $50,000. 
 Salaries for the performers could come down too. Mr. McCollum said the minimum weekly salary for an Off Broadway performer was about $1,100, compared with $1,600 for a Broadway performer. A spokeswoman for Actors' Equity Association said that the producers had been given permission to close the show and reopen it under a new contract. Mr. McCollum said offers had gone out for the Off Broadway production, but no casting was ready to be announced.
 Mr. Lopez said the Off Broadway production would likely use a smaller group of musicians, similar to the original Off Broadway run at the Vineyard Theater in 2003, and some reorchestration of the music might be needed. Otherwise it will use the same sets (and same puppets), and its creative team, including its director Jason Moore and book author Jeff Whitty, will remain. 
 Mr. McCollum said this was the first time that a musical had transferred to an Off Broadway theater from a Broadway house in the same season. A spokesman for the Off Broadway League said that at least two other productions have previously made this move, including the drama '' 'night, Mother'' in 1984 and the musical ''Billy Bishop Goes to War,'' which played 12 Broadway performances in 1980. The Broadway League said it did not keep records on such events, but similar transfers are exceedingly rare. The musical ''Simply Heavenly,'' with book and lyrics by Langston Hughes, moved from the Playhouse on Broadway to the Renata Theater in Greenwich Village, but that was in 1957. 
 Mr. McCollum said he was proud to keep alive a musical that satirizes difficult economic realities during a period of financial downturn.
 ''We just think it's important that we stay in New York, and we stay in the neighborhood,'' he said. ''Now we'll let the public decide if it's a good idea or not.''

HEADLINE: Overseas Without the Family

BYLINE: By TANYA MOHN

 BODY:
Companies still want footprints around the world, even at a time when their business has slowed. But it is no surprise that many companies have cut back on sending employees overseas in order to reduce costs. 
 Even so, alternatives to traditional long-term assignments ''have grown immensely,'' said Scott Sullivan, an executive vice president of Brookfield Global Relocation Services, the firm that produces the annual Global Relocation Trends Survey. The most common alternative, short-term assignments, which typically last from several months to a year, have tripled in the last eight years, Mr. Sullivan said. 
 ''They're cheaper because it doesn't involve bringing the family,'' he said. 
 But while companies can cut their immediate costs, other problems can crop up. ''Companies can run afoul of compliance on tax and immigration laws'' in host countries, Mr. Sullivan said. Some have gotten their hands slapped, had fines imposed or had employees deported or, in extreme cases, put in jail. 
 A. Pendleton DuPuis, president of the Emigra Group, a consulting firm that manages visa and immigration programs, works with many companies, often after they get in trouble. ''They don't want to take the risk of being shut down or having key people return home,'' Mr. DuPuis said. 
 He recounted how a large American company sent an executive to run operations temporarily in Spain, but when immigration authorities there discovered he did not have working papers, ''they actually came to his office and asked him to leave'' within three days. The authorities could have shut down the company offices, he said. Instead, the executive left the country voluntarily. 
 Countries have cracked down for reasons that include heightened security and economic pressure. Countries are getting more sophisticated, and there is more sharing of tax and immigration information within countries and between countries because technology has made that easier, said Maria Martorello, a partner in the global employer services practice at Deloitte's tax division. ''Before, countries were able to put their heads in the sand. Now, they cannot ignore these risk areas.'' 
 According to a report by KPMG, compliance is particularly tough for extended business travelers who ''fly below the radar'' because they frequently travel to one or multiple locations and have unpredictable schedules, making them difficult for companies to track. 
 Some companies have started using various tools to help identify these ''stealth expatriates.'' Accenture, the management consulting firm, started using an interactive Web site, the Global Mobility Relocation Navigator, to help inform employees about visa and tax issues. 
 Support services and an assessment of an employee's suitability for the job also are critical, said Brenda H. Fender, director of global initiatives for Worldwide ERC, an association concerned with work-force mobility. Poorly chosen or unprepared employees and their families can jeopardize the success of an assignment, she said. 
 The Interchange Institute, a research and consulting organization based in Brookline, Mass., recently released two studies that looked at the effect short-term and extended business travel assignments had on employees and their families. 
 The studies found that while these assignments were intended to be cost effective for companies, there was unexpected stress on family income: only about a third of families surveyed believed they were adequately compensated for additional expenses for communication, household help, transportation and child care. Short-term assignments, while considered less disruptive than long-term postings, pose ''clear challenges to families,'' said Anne P. Copeland, the institute's executive director. 
 That was the case for Marc Lawlor and his family. When he agreed to a 12-month consulting assignment in environmental engineering in Dubai last year, the move was intended to add international experience to his resume and increase his pay, while also allowing his wife to keep her job and their two children to remain in their schools. 
 But his employer, a small company, provided few services to assist them, Mr. Lawlor said. ''It was their first foray bringing a U.S. employee overseas.'' The first two months were tough, he said, as he worked 10 hours a day and looked for housing at night. ''And the paperwork was never properly done by the company.'' Mr. Lawlor said he drove over the border to Oman several times to get his visa renewed, and the company paid fines on a few occasions. 
 His wife, Debbie Alaimo Lawlor, had her own challenges. ''What you go through is a kind of depression,'' she said. ''Four weeks into the assignment I just started to get really, really lonely. '' She paid her own expenses to visit Dubai nine months into the assignment. ''If I visited Dubai at the beginning, I think it would have made it a lot easier, but we didn't know what to ask for,'' she said. 
 When Mr. Lawlor returned home this year, he was laid off two days later. ''It came as a shock to us,'' Ms. Lawlor said. 
 But there were some unexpected benefits to the overseas experience. The couple's two children rose to the occasion by pitching in with household chores and being supportive. ''For my 50th birthday,'' Ms. Lawlor said, ''my son actually sent flowers because he knew his dad would have done this.''

HEADLINE: A Mailbox Overloaded On Politics

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN. 
E-mail: haberman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
With Primary Day, New Yorkers finally catch a break. Their mailboxes will no longer be clogged -- until the next time, anyway -- with clumps of mailings that politicians and all too many political writers call ''campaign literature.''
 Most dictionaries regard literature as a somewhat loftier pursuit than the hounding of the citizenry. A typical main definition of the word is this from Merriam-Webster's Desk Dictionary: ''The production of written works having excellence of form or expression and dealing with ideas of permanent interest.'' 
 Now look at the political flier in your mailbox. Is there anything about its form or expression that smacks of excellence, or a single idea that is likely to hold your interest permanently?
 That's what we thought.
 This season's campaign literature has clung for the most part to oxymoronic tradition, although some of it has been eye-grabbing. More on that later.
 First, consider the significance of a Sept. 15 primary. Exactly one year ago, the Dow Jones industrial average tanked, losing more than 500 points and sending the country into its economic tailspin. Tuesday's elections are the first for major local offices to be held since then.
 A lot has been written about the financial import of the anniversary. Little has been said about how the Wall Street crisis altered the nature of democracy in New York City.
 A year ago, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg was frustrated. He was not going to be president or vice president. Presiding over a foundation to dole out some of his billions didn't get his juices flowing. For months, he had explored ways to run a third time for mayor.
 Standing in his way, however, was this pesky thing called a term-limits law, twice approved by New Yorkers in referendums. It limited him and other major officeholders to two terms. Mr. Bloomberg himself used to love the two-term limit. More than once, he described it as ideal -- until it got in his way.
 Sept. 15, 2008, provided the game changer for New York democracy.
 The financial turmoil gave the mayor cover (You can't let me go in this crisis -- I'm too valuable) to override the will of the people. He got the City Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, to go along. That wasn't too hard. Ms. Quinn's own political ambition, to become the next mayor, had withered as the result of a money scandal that enveloped the Council.
 Narrowly, by a vote of 29 to 22, the Council gave her what she and the mayor wanted, extending term limits for four more years. How powerful a motivator was self-interest? Of the 29 who voted for the extension, 23 would have been forced out of office this year. They gave themselves a way to cling to their Council seats.
 In alphabetical order, they were:
 Maria Baez, Leroy G. Comrie Jr., Erik Martin Dilan, Simcha Felder, Lewis A. Fidler, Helen D. Foster, Alan J. Gerson, Robert Jackson, Melinda R. Katz, G. Oliver Koppell, Miguel Martinez, Michael C. Nelson and Ms. Quinn. Also, Domenic M. Recchia Jr., Diana Reyna, Joel Rivera, James Sanders Jr., Larry B. Seabrook, Helen Sears, Kendall Stewart, Peter F. Vallone Jr., Albert Vann and David Yassky.
 Ms. Katz and Mr. Yassky have since switched gears; both are running for city comptroller. Mr. Martinez probably would have sought re-election had he not been forced to resign as an admitted crook.
 SO we have situations that would not have been possible a year ago, like an irony-free statement last week from the candidate Mr. Bloomberg on how to improve the functioning of democracy in New York.
 And we have all that fine literature in our mailboxes.
 In fairness, some of it has nothing to do with term limits. That concept certainly never applied to Robert M. Morgenthau, who some suspect has been Manhattan's district attorney since the days of New Amsterdam. The hot race to succeed him has produced some of the more eye-catching mailings.
 Leslie Crocker Snyder beats up Cyrus R. Vance Jr. for having left Manhattan years ago in favor of, eeeww, Seattle. The third candidate in that race, Richard M. Aborn, says in an advertisement that he ''spent 30 years taking guns out of the hands of criminals.'' Directly beneath that is a photo of former Vice President Dick Cheney holding a vintage rifle. Cheney. Criminal. Get it?
 But the end is at hand. For literature, we will simply have to be content with all those bank promotions and mailers for phony-baloney sweepstakes.

HEADLINE: This Year, Principals' Power Means They Decide What to Cut

BYLINE: By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
The band class at Public School 48 on Staten Island is no more. At Middle School 189 in Queens, the after-school program credited with raising math and reading scores has vanished. And that end-of-the-year steak dinner for high achievers at Public School 273 in Brooklyn? Gone, too.
 New York City's 1,500 public schools officially opened for business last week, and alongside the usual confusion over locker assignments and lunch periods, there were new questions in the air: Why isn't Mrs. Brown teaching here anymore? What happened to the science lab? Where are the boxes of free notebooks and pencils? 
 Across the city, principals are facing budgets that are 5 percent slimmer, a steep cut for a school system where coffers swelled until the current economic downturn. As a result, principals, who now wield extraordinary authority over budgets, are learning to say ''No,'' and hoping the changes they make will not result in academic ruin.
 With cash in short supply but loud mandates from above to keep test scores high, principals say they are confronting some of their most challenging decisions, like small class sizes or tutors in English and math? After-school remediation or extra lunchroom monitors? Chess club or drumming class?
 ''It's tough,'' said Melessa Avery, principal of P.S. 273, which earned an A on its report card from the city this year. ''I want to be held accountable, I'm always open to that, but you are stripping me of funds that have helped me become successful.''
 At the start of school, Ms. Avery gathered her staff to tell them it would be one of the most difficult years they would face. This year, the school will have 29 students to a class, instead of 21, four fewer teachers and fewer incentives for students, such as free bicycles.
 In a back-to-school slideshow, Ms. Avery told teachers they might be asked to take on multiple jobs. She suggested they scour advertisements for supplies and post cheap finds in the teachers' lounge, and urged them to hold grant-writing get-togethers.
 ''Don't hoard, share,'' she listed as mantra No. 1 in her presentation. 
 In Queens, Cindy Diaz-Burgos, who is beginning her sixth year as principal of M.S. 189, said it would be difficult to keep students on track academically with such severe cuts. Her budget was trimmed by about $285,000, and in August she discovered her school would lose at least $65,000 more from the state because it no longer qualified as a low-performing school needing extra support.
 ''It's like being diabetic,'' she said. ''The doctor gives you medication and your levels are good, and then he suddenly decides to take you off. We need all the money we can get.''
 In light of the reductions, Ms. Diaz-Burgos decided to eliminate an after-school program of tutoring in English, math, science and social studies. She has also ended a volleyball program that had attracted 90 students before breakfast, and students will be expected to pay for their own hand sanitizer and tissues to protect against swine flu. 
 Citywide, principals made most of the reductions by eliminating teaching positions (36 percent of the cuts) or reducing spending on equipment, supplies and books (28 percent), according to the Department of Education. Some schools also reduced spending on substitutes and overtime pay for teachers. 
 Teachers whose positions are eliminated are not laid off but instead are placed in a reserve pool and serve as substitutes. Chancellor Joel I. Klein has urged principals to use the reserve pool to fill openings rather than hiring from outside the system, because the teachers in the pool are already drawing full pay.
 Education officials said they did not expect spending on arts programs, which makes up about 3 percent of the total budget, to decrease disproportionately because of the cuts. 
 But Richard Kessler, executive director of the Center for Arts Education, said he had received complaints from ''many, many quarters'' that schools were disproportionately trimming arts supply budgets and eliminating part-time arts educators.
 Ernest A. Logan, president of the Council of School Supervisors and Administrators, the city's principals' union, said the cuts had led local organizations to fill the gaps. For instance, at Public School 86 in Brooklyn, he said, a local church provided free backpacks filled with supplies to students. Parents had pushed the Department of Education to allow the continued hiring school aides paid with P.T.A. funds as a way to keep school staffs robust and won that battle. ''We're really looking at the community to pick up some of the slack,'' Mr. Logan said. ''And the community is coming forward.''
 It is not the first time in recent years that schools have had to cut spending. In 2008, school budgets were cut by 1 percent in January, followed by another 1 percent in November. Most city agencies have endured similar cuts, because of the sluggish economy.
 Federal stimulus dollars helped offset some of this year's cut, but not enough to eliminate it entirely.
 ''The stimulus is wonderful and it is great and it has saved jobs and programs, but we can't kid ourselves,'' said Photeine Anagnostopoulos, chief operating officer for the Education Department, saying that half the school districts in the country were in a similar position. ''It didn't cover everything.''
 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who gained control of city schools in 2002, has made it a priority to give principals more power over their schools. Principals now have control over much of their spending, as well as the power to hire teachers and choose vendors for academic programs.
 Ms. Avery said it was important to share that power in a time of crisis, adding that she had consulted teachers in deciding what to cut so they would all have ownership over the decisions.
 ''We know that we're not the only ones who are going through this,'' she said. ''The entire country is going through this. Nobody said this job was going to be easy, and it's still not easy.''

HEADLINE: Many Faces, and Phases, of Steel in Cars

BYLINE: By HENRY FOUNTAIN

 BODY:
For all the talk of reinvention in the auto industry, of car companies using high-tech materials to make lighter and stronger vehicles that are safer and more fuel-efficient, the mainstay of the mass-produced automobile is the same as it has always been: steel. The modern car still contains more of it than anything else, about 60 percent by weight. 
 But automotive steel has changed quite a bit since the first Model T rolled off the assembly line. Metallurgists and manufacturers have learned to manipulate steel's microstructure through precise control of processing to create sheet steels of increasing strength. Prompted by crash-worthiness requirements and the need to make cars lighter to improve gas mileage, automakers are replacing conventional steels with advanced high-strength ones.
 Where once a single grade of steel might have sufficed, the typical ''body in white,'' as automakers call a car's basic skeleton, might now be a patchwork of a dozen or more steels of different types and strengths, tailored through computer modeling to handle the stress and strain of normal driving -- and of severe crashes. 
 ''The day of the mild steel part at the Ford Motor Company is dead,'' said Ford's chief safety engineer, Steve Kozak. ''The majority of steels we're using now are high strength or ultra high strength.''
 The advanced steels go by names like D.P. (for dual phase) and TRIP (for transformation-induced plasticity). The strongest ones are used in parts like door beams, where the aim is to stop a foreign object (like another car's bumper) from entering the passenger compartment, and windshield pillars, where the goal is to prevent the roof from flattening like a pancake in a rollover. 
 In the front and rear of the vehicle, where there is more room to absorb the energy of a collision, steels that deform more easily, and get stronger as they do, might be used. Even body panels, which are usually made from milder steel, are bake hardenable, getting stronger as they are heated during paint curing to resist denting better.
 North American carmakers draw a lot of criticism for overall design and reliability of their cars, but they generally receive high marks for their use of advanced steels. ''I'd say North America doesn't have to take a back seat to anyone,'' said Richard A. Schultz of Ducker Worldwide, a consulting firm that tracks materials use by automakers. 
 The steel industry, Mr. Schultz said, has worked to develop new products, to keep steel in cars and to fend off the increased use of aluminum and other materials. They have been developing higher-strength products for decades, beginning with high-strength low-alloy, or H.S.L.A., steels. But most were costly to produce and difficult to make into parts. ''They were looked at as more for aerospace applications,'' Mr. Schultz said.
 Only in recent years have researchers and manufacturers figured out how to make economical high-strength steels that are pliant enough to be stamped and formed and that can be welded or otherwise joined to other parts in the complex auto assembly process, where time is money. 
 ''At the end of the day we have to manufacture everything that's there,'' said James G. Schroth, lab group manager in the Materials and Processes Lab of General Motors' Research and Development Center. ''The real changes in technology have been the higher-strength materials we can still make into parts.''
 Using higher-strength steel, a part can be downgauged -- made from thinner stock -- to help improve fuel economy. But some parts, notably exterior panels, are already so thin -- less than a millimeter, or one twenty-fifth of an inch, in many cases -- that stiffness becomes an issue. ''You reach a thickness where you can't go even thinner,'' Mr. Schroth said.
 Like other steels, high-strength varieties begin as molten iron produced from ore and coke in a blast furnace. ''Despite literally hundreds of years of development of the process, it's still the best and most economical way of making high-purity iron,'' said Blake K. Zuidema, director of automotive product applications for the steelmaker ArcelorMittal.
 The molten iron, usually with scrap added, is made into steel in a basic oxygen furnace, in which oxygen is blown into the melt (''basic'' in the name refers to the alkaline materials used to line the furnace). The gas oxidizes the iron and removes some impurities and most of the carbon. (High-carbon steel is very hard but difficult to work.) 
 For most automotive purposes, the steel is cast into a slab. At this point, Dr. Zuidema said, ''you have a product that is not too much different than conventional steels,'' except for the addition of small amounts of other metals -- alloys.
 Some of the strength of steel is gained through alloying, said David K. Matlock, a metallurgist at the Colorado School of Mines and director of the Advanced Steel Processing and Products Research Center, which is supported by auto and steel companies. 
 Small amounts of metals like niobium or vanadium help keep the steel hard during hot rolling, where the slab is squeezed into a long sheet about two to four millimeters thick. But depending on the metal and how much of it is used, alloying can be costly. ''For automotive steels, you want them to be inexpensive,'' Dr. Matlock said. ''The alloying that goes into them has to be low.''
 The next step in transforming the steel relies not on adding metals, but on using temperature to change the arrangement of the atoms in steel. Like most metals, steel has a crystalline structure, with iron and other atoms arranged in orderly fashion. But steel is not a single continuous crystal, like, say, the silicon that is used for semiconductor production. Rather, it consists of crystallites, or grains, that can vary in size and orientation.
 To change the crystal structure, manufacturers use techniques like cold rolling, annealing and quenching. The steel sheet is rolled again, at room temperature, and heated to a high temperature for a specific time before being rapidly cooled, or quenched, by water. The process is fast, continuous and precisely controlled. 
 ''Very fast cooling gives us the ability to get unique structures with far less alloying,'' Dr. Zuidema said.
 The process results in phase transformations, or changes in the steel's crystalline structure. When the sheet is heated above about 1,300 degrees Fahrenheit, some of the basic cube-shaped crystals, known as ferrite, transform to another cube-shaped phase, austenite. The rapid cooling then converts the austenite to a third phase, martensite, which has an elongated shape and traps more carbon atoms. ''Martensite is a very refined structure,'' Dr. Matlock said, and adds strength.
 The result is a steel with dual phases of ferrite and martensite, and by precisely controlling temperature and timing, the amounts of the two can be varied to produce steels of differing strengths and formability characteristics. Steelmakers can, in effect, dial up the strength and ductility desired. ''You get the final structure you want,'' Dr. Matlock said, ''and create the final properties you need for the specific design.''
 The so-called martensitic transformation can be thought of as a slight repositioning of the atoms that reshapes the crystal. The change is so rapid that it travels through the steel at about the speed of sound. Such transformations are not limited to steels, or even metals; the protein crystals in the tail sheath of some viruses, for example, undergo a martensitic transformation, changing their structure rapidly before the tail invades a bacterium.
 In some high-strength steels, all of the ferrite ends up being converted to martensite; in others, some austenite remains. High-martensite steels, including those with small amounts of boron added, are difficult to form, so parts are usually made by hot stamping, in which the steel is heated first, stamped and then cooled to allow phase transformation and hardening. Steels with retained austenite are easier to form and get harder during the forming process, or even when crumpling in a crash, as the deformations convert the austenite to martensite.
 For the car manufacturer, there is a complex calculus involving strength, weight requirements and costs that go into choosing what steel goes where. A part made of stronger steel may save some weight, but it may require more work to produce the necessary tools and dies. ''Tool development costs a lot of money,'' said Mr. Schultz, of Ducker Worldwide. Other steels could require different welding methods, so it might not be practical or cost-effective to introduce them into an assembly line.
 What is certain, though, is that cars are going to have to continue becoming lighter and stronger. New federal regulations, for example, call for the roof to be able to withstand three times the vehicle's weight in a rollover, twice the previous standard. And Mr. Schultz has calculated that to meet fuel economy goals for 2020, carmakers will have to keep replacing mild steels, and even some early-generation high-strength grades, with higher-strength steels (and in some cases with aluminum, plastics and other materials).
 For steelmakers, that means continuing development of more advanced products that are stronger and yet remain formable. ''It's a systematic engineering process,'' said Dr. Zuidema, of ArcelorMittal. ''We have a fairly comprehensive knowledge of how each of the potential phases in the iron-carbon system affects the mechanical properties.'' So if they know what properties are desired, they can determine the structure needed, and thus the combination of alloying and processing to achieve that structure.
 For the steel companies, even incremental improvements will help the car companies meet crash and fuel standards -- and help the steelmakers keep other materials manufacturers at bay.
 ''You're fighting for ounces here,'' Mr. Schultz said. ''You're turning over every rock. I've told my steel friends, fasten your seatbelts.''

HEADLINE: Japan Struggles to Balance Growth and Job Stability

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
Every day, the impeccably dressed ''elevator girls'' of Tokyo's Odakyu department store greet customers, ushering them in and out of the cars. During breaks, they practice their greetings and meticulously reapply their makeup.
 Critics see the women as the embodiment of this country's productivity problem -- squandering of one of the world's best educated labor forces on banal jobs that do little to make the economy grow. But others, including the Democrats, Japan's new ruling party, see them as beneficiaries of a more humane capitalism, a capitalism that values employment and stability over growth.
 Japanese manufacturers taught the world to be competitive -- reshaping the landscape in industries like cars and electronics, and introducing a vocabulary of quality and efficiency that became a mantra on business school campuses and shop floors. 
 But productivity growth in Japan's service sector has slowed in recent years, weighing on the labor productivity of the entire economy, which ranks only 18th among the 30 countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and just 70 percent of levels in the United States. 
 With the service industry making up 70 percent of Japan's economy, and manufacturers battered by the global slowdown, economists say Japan's ability to emerge from the worst recession since World War II will depend partly on its ability to make its service sector more productive.
 ''Structural reforms have absolutely no popularity in the current climate,'' Yorio Ota, a strategist at the Mitsubishi UFJ Trust and Banking Corporation, said in a recent report. ''But what is needed for a true recovery are reforms of the Japanese economy.'' 
 But Yukio Hatoyama, the leader of the ruling Democratic Party, bases his political philosophy on what he calls ''fraternity,'' meaning empathy with workers, rather than concern for corporate profits.
 Hirohisa Fujii, a leading contender for finance minister when Mr. Hatoyama announces his cabinet this week, has criticized even some of the moderate changes made by the departing Liberal Democratic Party. 
 ''Market economics is supposed to make a lot of people happy by letting skilled people fully utilize their skills,'' Mr. Fujii, an elder statesman and former finance minister, wrote in a newspaper column last year. But recent pro-market changes in Japan ''did not make everybody happy,'' he said. '' That must be corrected, and we must build a politics led by the people.'' 
 Evidence of low productivity in the service sector is everywhere: office workers still pour over paper files; a veritable receiving line of security guards and receptionists greets visitors at building entrances; and Japanese retailers employ twice the average number of workers per outlet as their peers in other Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries. Odakyu does not consider its ''elevator girls'' a wasteful extravagance. The store says the 14 full-time workers it employs to operate fully automated elevators provide a benefit. 
 ''These girls are the first employees our customers see,'' said Tatsuo Iwasaki, manager for customer services. ''We take training them very seriously.''
 Mr. Hatoyama is especially critical of changes championed by the former prime minister, the pro-American, free-market Junichiro Koizumi. Among other things, Mr. Koizumi took aim at Japan's stagnant labor market, lifting a ban on the use of temporary laborers at factories.
 He hoped to increase flexibility in hiring at Japanese companies, many of which are saddled with more employees-for-life than they need, protected by labor laws and social norms. The inability to fire these redundant workers even in lean times keeps productivity at ailing companies low, while hurting upstarts that could use experienced workers. 
 But critics blamed those changes for a widening income gap between lifetime workers and their poorer ''temp'' colleagues. The number of temporary workers, with low pay, few benefits and little job security, has surged in the last decade, reaching a third of the work force of 67 million. The plight of temporary workers let go en masse in the fallout from the global financial crisis has prompted a public outcry. 
 ''People started to see high levels of economic inequality. The quality of jobs started going down, and there was a growing number of temporary workers,'' said Steven K. Vogel, a professor of political science at the University of California, Berkeley. ''They associated that with Mr. Koizumi's reforms. From an economic standpoint, it was wrong. But there was a big backlash.''
 The Democrats' economic platform centers on consumer relief, including cash allowances for families rearing children and lower gasoline taxes. Economists say such policies could stimulate Japan's flagging consumer spending and help spur a modest recovery. But with wages in decline, it is unclear how much consumers can be expected to increase spending in the long term. 
 To generate lasting growth, Japan needs to change old rules and dictates that have guarded a sclerotic establishment with heavy-handed government protection and squashed entrepreneurship with cumbersome barriers, some economists say.
 A cautionary tale, repeated by market proponents and opponents, is about QB Net, a start-up that took on Japan's highly regulated barber market 10 years ago. QB Net's string of super-efficient shops took the market by storm by offering quick haircuts for 1,000 yen, or about $10. Last fiscal year, the company logged sales of 6.73 billion yen, while the rest of the industry slumped. 
 Threatened, a nationwide association for barbershops called for more regulation. Among other things, the association argued that it was unclean for QB Net to offer haircuts to clients without first washing their hair; soon, ordinances were passed across the country requiring all barbershops to install shampooing facilities, an expensive investment that slowed QB's growth. 
 ''It's not right to be penalized for being successful,'' said Kazutaka Iwai, chief executive at QB Net. ''We simply came up with a way to be more productive.'' 
 Others, however, argue that Japan's traditional barbershops, though outdated, are worth saving. These tiny salons have consistently employed about 250,000 barbers for three decades, and the shopkeepers are often central figures in a kind of community life that many Japanese fear is being lost. 
 ''There are many structural factors that may influence the relationship between productivity and social welfare,'' said David J. Brunner, a Japan specialist and research associate at Harvard Business School. ''So firms should fire their excess employees and leave them feeling betrayed and worthless, and without income? That certainly would not contribute to economic growth or the general welfare.'' 
 Even the Liberal Democrats have spoken out in recent years against the pro-market changes introduced by Mr. Koizumi, one of their own. The most fervently antichange Liberal Democrats -- who left the party to form their own after opposing a proposal to privatize the postal service -- will join in a coalition government with the new prime minister-elect, Mr. Hatoyama.
 The Democrats' other coalition partners are the Social Democrats.
 ''We will fight with all our might to rebuild the livelihoods the public so sorely misses,'' the Social Democratic leader, Mizuho Fukushima, said this week. ''We will build a politics that values life, and corrects widening inequalities.''

HEADLINE: Hawaii Tries Green Tools In Remaking Power Grids

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

DATELINE: NAALEHU, Hawaii 

 BODY:
Two miles or so from this tiny town in the southernmost corner of the United States, across ranches where cattle herds graze beneath the distant Mauna Loa volcano, the giant turbines of a new wind farm cut through the air. 
 Sixty miles to the northeast, near a spot where golden-red lava streams meet the sea in clouds of steam, a small power plant extracts heat from the volcanic rock beneath it to generate electricity. 
 These projects are just a slice of the energy experiment unfolding across Hawaii's six main islands. With the most diverse array of alternative energy potential of any state in the nation, Hawaii has set out to become a living laboratory for the rest of the country, hoping it can slash its dependence on fossil fuels while keeping the lights on.
 Every island has at least one energy accent: waves in Maui, wind in Lanai and Molokai, solar panels in Oahu and eventually, if all goes well, biomass energy from crops grown on Kauai. Here on the Big Island of Hawaii, seawater is also being converted to electricity.
 Still, the state faces enormous challenges in delivering the power to the people who need it. While the urban sprawl around Honolulu consumes the bulk of the energy, most potential renewable sources are far from the city, 150 miles southeast or 100 miles to the northwest.
 Each of the state's six electric grids belongs to its own island and is unconnected to the others. And according to state figures, Hawaii still relies on imported oil to generate 77 percent of its electricity, a level of dependency unique in the United States. Coal-fired power provides 14 percent, and 9 percent comes from renewable sources like the wind or the sun. 
 Hawaii's governor, Linda Lingle, a Republican, has resolved to throw off the yoke of oil dependence and harness the state's potential. 
 Under an agreement reached last year with the federal government and the dominant local utility, the Hawaiian Electric Company, Hawaii plans to generate 40 percent of its power from renewable sources by 2030. The state's six grids will be connected by cables, and planners hope that conservation steps like reducing the air-conditioning load at high-rise hotels will cut Hawaii's energy consumption by nearly a third. 
 ''The goals are very, very aggressive,'' said Debra Lew, a senior project leader for the federal National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Three decades ago, Hawaii mapped out a similar vision, if in less detail, that came to nothing. But this time, planners say, failure is not an option. ''We don't have anywhere else to go,'' said Ted Peck, the point man for the Hawaii Clean Energy Initiative, overseen by the State Department of Business, Economic Development and Tourism.
 Even if the state were indifferent to the environmental costs of burning oil and gas, including carbon-dioxide emissions that contribute to global warming, it would have to embrace renewable energy sources, said Robert Alm, a vice president of the Hawaiian Electric Company. ''Our hedge won't be buying oil futures, it will be buying wind,'' Mr. Alm said.
 Heavy reliance on imported oil has proved economically perilous. When oil prices hit $147 a barrel a year ago, electricity rates approached or briefly exceeded 50 cents per kilowatt hour on Maui and Kauai, about five times the national average.
 The spike in prices lent urgency to the Hawaii Clean Energy Initiative, which Governor Lingle unveiled in January 2008. 
 The technical and political obstacles have since become clearer. 
 Hopscotching around this brightly colored archipelago by plane, a visitor gets a vivid sense of Hawaii's essentially rural nature and the scope of the challenge. 
 The biggest priority is laying undersea cables between the outer islands and Oahu. Once those connections are made -- first with cables stretching from Molokai and Lanai, the islands nearest Oahu -- the capital will get power through them. 
 Then there is the daunting challenge of feeding fluctuating wind and solar power into the small electric grids on the individual islands while devising backup systems to keep the energy output smooth and reliable.
 On Maui, for instance, General Electric is working on ways to modulate demand and store energy for later use either in electric batteries or by pump storage -- filling an elevated reservoir in low-demand periods to produce hydropower when needed.
 ''The whole trick is making the system work in the right way, like conducting an orchestra,'' said Bob Gilligan, G.E.'s vice president for transmission and distribution.
 On the financial side, the state must attract developers with enough financing to help underwrite their own wind, solar, wave or other renewable projects, carry out the required environmental reviews and secure local approval. Addressing local concerns can be especially challenging. As in any state with a rural-urban divide, residents of Hawaii's less populous outlying areas are wary about being pushed around by planners in Honolulu. 
 The outer islands have higher concentrations of Native Hawaiians who are well versed in a local history of exploitation, from the American overthrow of their monarch in 1893 to environmental costs of sugar plantations and tourism. 
 Some have formed groups like the Pele Defense Fund, which sprang up here in the 1980s to protect religious gathering rights in the rain forest on the Big Island. The fund seeks to prevent desecration of Pele, the native goddess of fire and volcanoes, and finds geothermal energy projects sacrilegious. 
 One avenue for developers, utilities and state officials is to offer outlying communities support or financing for needs that the local population identifies, like fish conservation. ''We're asking the small islands to be significantly burdened on behalf of Oahu, so Oahu needs to do well by them,'' said Mr. Alm, the utility's vice president. 
 For all the optimism, planners studiously remind themselves of the detritus of past failures, like the dismembered and rusting wind turbines of a defunct wind farm near the southern end of the Big Island.
 ''This transformation is going to take a generation,'' said Ted Liu, director of the state economic development department. ''There are no short-term easy solutions.''

HEADLINE: College Graduation Rates

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''At Colleges, Too Few Diplomas,'' by David Leonhardt (Economic Scene, Sept. 9):
 The current method for calculating collegiate graduation rates is notoriously flawed. While the majority of college students transfer to another institution at least once, and often twice, they are considered dropouts by the United States Department of Education's method, which tracks only one cohort of first-time full-time freshmen across a six-year span at one institution. 
 Mr. Leonhardt's column doesn't mention this critical flaw in the methodology, and reveals substantial bias in favor of only the most traditional idea of higher education -- the four-year residential college, counting for a clear minority of all college students today. 
 The majority of college students today are nontraditional by age, source of support (themselves) and commuting patterns. Many who start full time shift to part-time enrollment to manage families and work while still pursuing degrees.
 A woman who starts college at 18, stops out for her family, and then completes her baccalaureate degree at 35 is not a dropout but a success story. She is the face of the majority of students on many campuses today. 
 Patricia McGuire Washington, Sept. 9, 2009
 The writer is president of Trinity Washington University.
 To the Editor:
 While our nation's leading universities, both public and private, consistently dominate global rankings, our success in establishing excellence in a relative handful of elite institutions does little to ensure continued national competitiveness, especially when one considers the disproportionately few students fortunate enough to attend top schools. 
 Unable to accommodate burgeoning enrollment demands at scale, our leading institutions have become increasingly ''exclusive'' -- predicated on exclusion to all but a few. The challenge of providing access to higher education for most Americans thus falls to less competitive schools. 
 In terms of societal outcomes, this implicit calculation is both shortsighted and misguided. In order for our nation to attain the educational objectives delineated by President Obama, what will be required are new institutional models that offer access to excellence to a broad demographic. 
 But even such access is insufficient unless institutions have the resolve and resources to adequately guide student outcomes. Without sufficient public investment, our schools cannot hope to offer the curriculums, programs, student services and facilities that will produce the graduation rates called for by the president. 
 Taken together, our public universities produce more than 70 percent of all baccalaureate degree recipients in our nation as well as two-thirds of all federally sponsored research. For Mr. Leonhardt to flog our de facto national university for its shortcomings in the face of diminishing public support does little to produce more optimal outcomes.

HEADLINE: Intuit Buys Mint, a Web-Based Finance Competitor

BYLINE: By JENNA WORTHAM

 BODY:
Mint.com, a start-up whose Web site helps people organize their money, rolled into some cash of its own on Monday, selling out to the personal finance giant Intuit for $170 million. 
 Companies like Intuit that sell boxed software have been struggling to gain their footing on the Web as free, online financial start-ups like Mint, SmartyPig and Wesabe have surged in popularity for their simplicity and ease of use, said Emmett Higdon, a senior analyst with Forrester Research who specializes in the online banking industry. 
 Intuit is the maker of widely used financial software applications like TurboTax and Intuit.
 ''Quicken seems like something your dad uses,'' Mr. Higdon said. Younger, Web-savvy users ''aren't likely to sit down nightly and enter in a bunch of financial information online,'' he said. ''These sites appeal to the iPhone audience.''
 In June, Microsoft discontinued sales of its boxed finance software, Microsoft Money Plus, but consumers can still find many similar functions on Microsoft's MSN Money Web site. It is a clear indication that online personal-finance sites are starting to have an impact, said Stessa Cohen, research analyst at Garter Research.
 ''Consumer awareness isn't huge but it's increasing,'' Ms. Cohen said.
 Mint, which unveiled its free online services in September 2007, quickly became popular as more people turned to the Web to create budgets and manage their finances. The company says it has 1.5 million users tracking nearly $50 billion in assets and $200 billion in transactions. 
 ''As Mint's product grew in popularity, it became clear it wasn't a question of if Intuit would acquire them anymore, but one of when and how much,'' said Jeff Clavier, founder of SoftTech VC, an early-stage investment company that backed Mint. 
 To date, Mint.com has taken more than $31 million in venture backing, from investment firms like Shasta Ventures, First Round Capital, Benchmark Capital and the angel investor Ron Conway. 
 Although Mint.com and Quicken Online are rival services, the companies say they will continue to operate the two sites independently, and incorporate some of Mint's features into Intuit's services. 
 ''We were much better served by having Mint and its leadership as part of Intuit instead of trying to build it separately,'' said Dan Maurer, senior vice president of Intuit's consumer group.
 The acquisition is subject to regulatory approval, but the companies said they hoped to close the deal by the end of the year. Both companies are based in Mountain View, Calif. After the transaction is complete, Mint.com will move its operations into Intuit's offices. 
 Aaron Patzer, Mint.com's founder and chief executive, will become general manager of Intuit's personal finance group and oversee the operations of Mint.com, Quicken and Quicken Online. He said that his first priority would be integrating some of Mint's features into Intuit's products. Eventually, he said, he hoped Mint.com could forge partnerships with financial institutions looking to upgrade their online and mobile-banking services, something Intuit already does through its Digital Insight subsidiary.
 ''Longer term, there's huge potential for Mint's technology and user-interface design on Intuit's banking and credit union division,'' he said.

HEADLINE: A Dubai Investment Arm Struggles With Debt Load

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr.

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
One of Dubai's most prominent investment funds is in talks with its bankers about refinancing its swollen debt burden after a steep fall in the value of its assets.
 Istithmar, the investment arm of the government-owned Dubai World conglomerate, has frozen its investment activity and laid off about 20 percent of its staff as it struggles to extract itself from a mountain of debt, according to a person briefed on its strategic plans. Analysts say the figure could well exceed $6 billion, a figure that in all likelihood is more than the equity value of the fund's beaten-down investment portfolio.
 The fund does not disclose its size, but as of April 2007, it had invested $3.5 billion. About $10 billion in debt was added -- a valuation that represented a high point. 
 The fund's predicament is an embarrassing turn of events for it, as well as for Istithmar's chief executive, David Jackson. It also underscores the extent to which highly leveraged companies, as well as countries, remain at risk despite the recent recovery in world markets.
 Set up in 2003, Istithmar came to be seen as the public face of a brash, acquisitive Dubai, which, unlike more conservative sovereign funds operating in the region, deployed high levels of leverage to finance a shopping spree that included the Queen Elizabeth 2 luxury liner; the department store Barneys New York; a stake in Cirque du Soleil, from Montreal; as well as luxury hotels in New York like the W on Union Square and the Mandarin Oriental on Columbus Circle.
 Most of these investments -- including that in Perella Weinberg Partners, the investment boutique, and GLG Partners, the asset management company -- were done at the top of the market, from 2005 to 2007.
 Istithmar was in many respects a scaled-down version of Dubai -- using bravado, debt and some dollops of cash to invest in global markets. That approach ended sharply with the onset of the credit crisis. Dubai World, which owns Istithmar as well as its sibling real estate company, Nakheel, has about $60 billion in debt, according to public filings, a figure that approaches the overall leverage of Dubai itself, which Moody's has estimated to be about $80 billion.
 ''These companies have invested heavily when valuations were very high, and they took on short-term debt to finance them,'' said Philipp Lotter, a Middle East analyst at Moody's. ''They now find themselves in a situation after deterioration in their stakes where they need to refinance. It is an explosive combination.''
 And while there has been speculation about the job security of Mr. Jackson, especially in light of the recent departures of two senior executives at the company, Dubai World has said recently that his position is not under threat.
 ''I continue to have the backing of Dubai World,'' Mr. Jackson said in an interview. ''And I am enthusiastic about our prospects. We will live to fight another day.''
 The extent to which Mr. Jackson lives up to his boast will depend upon whether banks agree to length the payment terms on Istithmar's debt burden and a sharp recovery in asset prices. Neither of these assumptions is a given: Barneys New York remains in financial trouble, and the recession's toll has had its effect on Istithmar's other luxury properties. These aspects of the situation generally do not put capital-constrained banks in a forgiving mood.
 Still, analysts and investors in the region do not expect Istithmar to have to go through anything close to a default or a public restructuring, in light of the ignominy such an outcome would bring to Dubai and its ruler, Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum. 
 ''This is likely to be taken care of outside the public eye,'' Mr. Lotter said.

HEADLINE: Trying to Rekindle a Fire: For Obama, a Window Is Closing

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON and JEFF ZELENY; Jack Healy contributed reporting.

 BODY:
President Obama on Monday sternly admonished the financial industry and lawmakers to accept his proposals to reshape financial regulation to protect the nation from a repeat of the excesses that drove Lehman Brothers into bankruptcy and wreaked havoc on the global economy last year. 
 But with the markets slowly healing, Mr. Obama's plan to revamp financial rules faces a diminishing political imperative. Disenchantment by many Americans with big government, along with growing obstacles from financial industry lobbyists pressing Congress not to do anything drastic, have also helped to stall his proposals. 
 Mr. Obama chastised Wall Street denizens in the audience at Federal Hall, at the foot of Wall Street. ''Instead of learning the lessons of Lehman and the crisis from which we are still recovering, they are choosing to ignore them,'' Mr. Obama said. ''They do so not just at their own peril, but at our nation's.''
 The speech came on the first anniversary of the collapse of Lehman Brothers and implicitly recognized that time was an enemy of reform. Throughout history, most major laws to change the financial system arose from the cauldron of a crisis. Senior officials have acknowledged that as the financial system begins to mend, a kind of political inertia sets in as lawmakers have less of an incentive to act boldly.
 Hoping to kick-start the legislation, Mr. Obama said: ''I want them to hear my words. We will not go back to the days of reckless behavior and unchecked excess at the heart of this crisis, where too many were motivated only by the appetite for quick kills and bloated bonuses.'' 
 He also warned that ''those on Wall Street cannot resume taking risks without regard for consequences, and expect that next time, American taxpayers will be there to break their fall.''
 Mr. Obama's speech in New York, like his address to Congress last week on health care, is part of an attempt to put the plan back on political track. But with the Senate preoccupied with the president's health care plan and strong opposition to central provisions of the financial overhaul, the president faces major hurdles on both the substance and the timetable. 
 Senior Congressional Democrats had originally planned to have the House complete its work on the financial overhaul before turning to the more recalcitrant Senate. But the tighter time schedule has forced lawmakers to rethink that approach. 
 Later this week, Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts and the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, is expected to announce a series of hearings for the coming days before his committee marks up legislation in October. Aides say he is hoping to get legislation to the floor by the end of next month or beginning of November.
 There is less certainty in the Senate, where Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut and the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, has been working to put together a package that could withstand the threat of a filibuster. 
 ''Failure to act leaves our economy at risk,'' Mr. Dodd said in a statement after the president's speech. ''We will not allow our efforts to be stalled by well financed special interests intent on keeping the status quo.''
 But Republican opponents of the administration's legislation said that it suffered from the same problems as the White House's health care plan.
 ''The president has offered a reform proposal that would grant broad new authorities to government bureaucrats while intruding in private markets and restricting personal choice,'' said Spencer Bachus of Alabama, the senior Republican on the House Financial Services Committee. ''The obvious lesson of the events of September 2008 is that we need smarter regulation, not more regulation, not more government bureaucracy, and not more incentives to engage in harmful business practices.''
 One major difficulty is that many of the issues do not break along party lines -- they tend instead to force disagreements between industries and their various supporters in Congress. So the fight is as much among Democrats as it is between parties.
 Big institutions and community banks have unified against a central provision of the plan to create a new consumer finance protection agency. The new agency would regulate mortgages, credit cards and other forms of consumer debt. The companies, and their Republican and Democratic allies in Congress, fear that the new agency would lead to unnecessarily burdensome oversight. 
 Some top regulators, including Sheila C. Bair, the head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, support the creation of the new agency but have said they would give it less authority than what the president is seeking.
 Lawmakers, particularly in the Senate but also in the House, have been skeptical of a second major plank that would give the Federal Reserve more explicit authority to monitor the markets for systemwide problems. 
 Opponents prefer an enlarged role for a council of regulators. The Obama plan creates such a council, but makes the Fed the first among equals and acknowledges, as the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, has said, that you cannot put out a fire by committee. Mr. Geithner, who before joining the administration was head of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, has said the administration's plan for the Fed is both incremental and essential. 
 He and Ben S. Bernanke, chairman of the Fed, have also said that no other agency is better positioned to play the lead role in monitoring markets for potential problems that could cascade through the financial system. 
 But there are lingering questions about the Fed's failure to adopt consumer protection measures to curb abusive mortgages and other regulations that could have reduced the risk-taking at large banks under its supervision. And top Fed officials were slow to grasp the depths of the problems once the crisis began.
 In recent weeks, Mr. Frank has been saying that the Fed might have to share the role of systemic risk regulator, indicating that there was not enough support in Congress to give the Fed alone the wider authority that the president had been seeking. Other central elements of the plan have come under assault.
 Major Wall Street companies, for example, have also worked to water down the president's proposal on tightening the rules for derivatives like credit default swaps. They have also lobbied heavily to make sure that any attempts to impose tough new restrictions on executive pay do not come to pass.

HEADLINE: A Tough Crowd on Wall Street

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

 BODY:
The cameras and lights were all trained on President Obama, as he delivered a stern message in downtown Manhattan about the need for reform in the finance industry.
 There was no cheering section. The audience offered up only one round of applause, and a scan of the faces as the president spoke -- grimacing, staring at the floor, nervously glancing at BlackBerrys -- spoke volumes about how they felt as they listened to the president's words. 
 ''We will not go back to the days of reckless behavior and unchecked excess that was at the heart of this crisis, where too many were motivated only by the appetite for quick kills and bloated bonuses,'' the president warned. 
 ''Those on Wall Street cannot resume taking risks without regard for consequences and expect that next time, American taxpayers will be there to break their fall.''
 His audience was Wall Street's top echelon, a group that included some people, as he suggested, who ''owe a debt to the American people.''
 There was Richard D. Parsons, chairman of Citigroup; Gary D. Cohn, president of Goldman Sachs; Roger C. Altman, chief executive of Evercore Partners; Daniel Loeb, founder of the hedge fund Third Point; Peter G. Peterson, a founder of the Blackstone Group; and James S. Chanos, the famous short-seller, among others. They wanted to be there, of course, since the invitation list reflected the power structure on Wall Street. It was as if the lunch crowd at the Four Seasons had relocated themselves downtown for the day. 
 But no bread was broken -- literally and figuratively. They came, they listened, they left. There was little sense that the country was any closer to reforming Wall Street. After the speech, they all departed for their real power lunches. 
 Just about every executive I spoke with afterward was politely supportive. 
 ''Tonally, he was correct,'' Mr. Cohn said. ''Reform is necessary.'' 
 That tone was a difficult balancing by the president, seeking the help of the industry to reform itself in one breath, and then chiding Wall Street for its behavior and practices in the next. 
 ''It was a collective failure of responsibility in Washington, on Wall Street and across America that led to the near-collapse of our financial system one year ago,'' the president said. Several audience members vigorously nodded in agreement, warming to the notion that blame was being shared on the unofficial anniversary of the financial meltdown.
 But then the president narrowed his aim, focusing more tightly on the role of Wall Street.
 ''You don't have to wait for a law to overhaul your pay system so that folks are rewarded for long-term performance instead of short-term gains,'' he said. 
 Another line was met with some scowls, ''It is neither right nor responsible after you've recovered with the help of your government to shirk your obligation to the goal of wider recovery, a more stable system and a more broadly shared prosperity.''
 Substantively, Mr. Obama called for more regulation and reform, pressing for ''resolution authority'' to handle the failure of an institution deemed ''too big to fail'' without impacting the rest of the market. It was one of the few topics that the audience, which also included Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, Paul A. Volcker and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, all seemed to agree needed to be a priority.
 The president also called, again, for ''a systemic regulator'' -- someone who could monitor all financial institutions and be able to take action before one firm's problems could infect the rest of the system. 
 The Obama administration has said that the Federal Reserve should be in charge of such monitoring. As I spoke with chief executives when we left the auditorium, most said they agreed with the need for a systemic regulator. But, as with other power battles going on between the Fed, the Treasury and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, nobody was exactly sure who should be in charge of it.
 The president's call for a new Consumer Financial Protection Agency was also greeted with mixed enthusiasm. Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase is among the banking chiefs who have come out against such a body -- not because he is against consumer protection, but because he has said that consumer protection should be enforced within one of the many regulatory units that already exists. Adding another division, he has argued, will only add to the morass of regulators that banking institutions have to deal with.
 Eugene Ludwig, founder of the Promontory Group and the former comptroller of the currency who is a veteran of regulatory affairs in Washington, agreed. ''We have an alphabet soup of regulators that is not copied anywhere in the world,'' said Mr. Ludwig by phone as he was traveling in Canada. ''Getting it right is more important than getting it done fast.''
 Mr. Ludwig is probably right: if there was any immediate message, it was that the chances of serious reform anytime soon seem remote. 
 Already, financial reform legislation does not look like it will be addressed in this calendar year. Representative Barney Frank, who was in the audience, has pledged to move aggressively on the issue. Without a crisis, though, there are real questions about whether these issues will ever be addressed. 
 But Mr. Obama appears to be hoping that the sting of this crisis is still fresh enough that his words will lead to action.
 ''It is incumbent on us to put in place those reforms that will prevent this kind of crisis from ever happening again,'' he said.

HEADLINE: A World Of Hurt

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
President Obama took a bit of a victory lap on Wall Street on Monday, declaring that the economy had been brought back from the abyss and ''the storms of the past two years are beginning to break.''
 The president and his economic team (and the Federal Reserve) deserve credit for moving quickly to prevent a full-blown collapse. A year ago, amid the panic that accompanied the implosion of Lehman Brothers, there were serious fears that the U.S. was headed toward another Great Depression. 
 Now, with the financial sector stabilized and economists predicting that the Great Recession is nearing an end, the sighs of relief coming out of Washington and Lower Manhattan are understandable. But this is no time to lose sight of the wreckage all around us. This recession, a full-blown economic horror, has left a gaping hole in the heart of working America that is unlikely to heal for years, if not decades.
 Fifteen million Americans are locked in the nightmare of unemployment, nearly 10 percent of the work force. A third have been jobless for more than six months. Thirteen percent of Latinos and 15 percent of blacks are out of work. (Those are some of the official statistics. The reality is much worse.)
 Consider this: Some 9.4 million new jobs would have to be created to get us back to the level of employment at the time that the recession began in December 2007. But last month, we lost 216,000 jobs. If the recession technically ends soon and we get to a point where some modest number of jobs are created -- say, 100,000 or 150,000 a month -- the politicians and the business commentators will celebrate like it's New Year's.
 But think about how puny that level of job creation really is in an environment that needs nearly 10 million jobs just to get us back to the lean years of the George W. Bush administration.
 We're hurtin' and there ain't much healin' on the horizon.
 A national survey of jobless workers by a pair of professors at Rutgers University shows just how traumatized the work force has become in this downturn. Two-thirds of respondents said that they had become depressed. More than half said it was the first time they had ever lost a job, and 80 percent said there was little or no chance that they would be able to get their jobs back when the economy improves.
 The 1,200 respondents were jobless at some point over the past year, and most -- 894 -- are still unemployed. More than half said that they had been forced to borrow money from friends or relatives, and a quarter have missed their mortgage or rent payments.
 The survey found that affluent, well-educated workers, who had traditionally been able to withstand a downturn in reasonably good shape, were being hit hard this time around. 
 The professors, Carl Van Horn and Cliff Zukin, described that phenomenon as ''a metric of the recession's seismic impact.'' Of the workers who found themselves unemployed for the first time, more than one in four had been earning $75,000 or more annually.
 ''This is not your ordinary dip in the business cycle,'' said Mr. Van Horn. ''Americans believe that this is the Katrina of recessions. Folks are on their rooftops without a boat.''
 Stunned by the financial and psychological toll of the recession, and seeing little in the way of hopeful signs on the employment landscape, many of the surveyed workers showed signs of discouragement. Three-fifths said that they had experienced feelings of helplessness.
 Said one respondent: ''I've always worked, so this is very depressing. At age 60, I never believed I would be unemployed unless I chose to be.''
 Said another: ''I fear for my family and my future. We are about to be evicted, and bills are piling. We have sold everything we possibly can to maintain, and are going under with little hope of anything.''
 At some point the unemployment crisis in America will have to be confronted head-on. Poverty rates are increasing. Tax revenues are plunging. State and local governments are in a terrible fiscal bind. Unemployment benefits for many are running out. Families are doubling up, and the number of homeless children is rising. 
 It's eerie to me how little attention this crisis is receiving. The poor seem to be completely out of the picture. 
 If we end up with yet another jobless recovery, there would seem to be little hope for impoverished families in America's big cities, rural areas and, increasingly, suburban neighborhoods as well.
 The recession may be ending for some. 
 Tell that to the unemployed.

HEADLINE: Judge Rejects A Settlement Over Bonuses

BYLINE: By ZACHERY KOUWE; Louise Story contributed reporting.

 BODY:
As President Obama traveled to Wall Street on Monday and chided bankers for their recklessness, across town a federal judge issued a far sharper rebuke, not just for some of the financiers but for their regulators in Washington as well. 
 Giving voice to the anger and frustration of many ordinary Americans, Judge Jed S. Rakoff issued a scathing ruling on one of the watershed moments of the financial crisis: the star-crossed takeover of Merrill Lynch by the now-struggling Bank of America. 
 Judge Rakoff refused to approve a $33 million deal that would have settled a lawsuit filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission against the Bank of America. The lawsuit alleged that the bank failed to adequately disclose the bonuses that were paid by Merrill before the merger, which was completed in January at regulators' behest as Merrill foundered. 
 He accused the S.E.C. of failing in its role as Wall Street's top cop by going too easy on one of the biggest banks it regulates. And he accused executives of the Bank of America of failing to take responsibility for actions that blindsided its shareholders and the taxpayers who bailed out the bank at the height of the crisis. 
 The sharply worded ruling, which invoked justice and morality, seemed to speak not only to the controversial deal, but also to the anger across the nation over the excesses that led to the financial crisis, and the lax regulation in Washington that permitted those excesses to flourish. 
 Implicit in the judge's remarks were broader questions on the anniversary of one of the most tumultuous weeks in Wall Street's history: What do the giants of finance owe their shareholders and the investing public? And who will adequately oversee these behemoths?
 Congress is pondering these issues as it prepares to reshape the power structure of financial regulators in Washington, including the S.E.C. President Obama is pushing lawmakers to pass tougher regulations this year that would touch everything from bonuses to the structural soundness of Wall Street's most powerful banks, even as some Democrats fret that the health care debate makes it unlikely that financial reform can be achieved. 
 ''We will not go back to the days of reckless behavior and unchecked excess at the heart of this crisis,'' Mr. Obama said in his speech before several hundred banking executives, lawmakers and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York. 
 Such consequences were at the heart of the dispute that came before Judge Rakoff, who had demanded that the S.E.C. and the bank explain which executives were responsible for failing to tell the bank's shareholders about the payout of Merrill's bonuses. That information, together with evidence of large undisclosed losses at Merrill, may have led shareholders to reject the merger at a time when the government wanted to forestall a worse meltdown of the financial system. 
 The judge accused Bank of America and the S.E.C. of concocting the settlement to effectively absolve themselves of further responsibility. 
 ''The S.E.C. gets to claim that it is exposing wrongdoing on the part of the Bank of America in a high-profile merger,'' he wrote, and ''the Bank's management gets to claim that they have been coerced into an onerous settlement by overzealous regulators.'' 
 The ruling echoes a long-standing criticism that the S.E.C. has largely failed to prosecute cases against corporate executives, opting for quick settlements in which companies themselves are penalized instead of their leaders.
 It comes as the agency, under its new leader, Mary L. Schapiro, is struggling to revive its reputation as an effective watchdog of Wall Street after presiding over a near-collapse of the financial markets and failing to catch the $65 billion Ponzi scheme run by Bernard L. Madoff.
 Judge Rakoff called the $33 million settlement unfair and inadequate, and ordered Bank of America and the S.E.C. to prepare for a possible trial that would begin by Feb. 1.
 Both the bank and the S.E.C. said they disagreed with the judge's decision and were evaluating their legal options. Experts said the S.E.C. could decide to appeal the case to a higher court or drop the charges altogether instead of going to trial, but they said the agency was unlikely to exercise those options. Some analysts argued the case itself was irrelevant given that Bank of America's takeover of Merrill had increased the bank's profits, resulting in a surge in its stock price. 
 The deal also saved Merrill from impending collapse and arguably prevented a greater financial calamity from unfolding in the immediate aftermath of the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy.
 ''I'm having a difficult time understanding who was harmed here,'' said Richard X. Bove, a banking analyst with Rochdale Securities. ''Why is this company being put into court over a series of events that benefited the nation, its economy, its financial system, the shareholders of Bank of America and the bank itself.''
 In forcing the two sides to argue their case in court, Judge Rakoff hopes to expose the truth about whether Bank of America lied to shareholders.
 ''It's a strong, blistering decision,'' said John C. Coffee, a Columbia Law School professor who has taught a course along with Judge Rakoff for 21 years. ''It is really a critique, not just of this case, but of a long-standing practice at the S.E.C., which effectively allowed corporate managers to buy immunity with their shareholders' money.''
 Judge Rakoff focused much of his criticism on the fact that the fine in the case would be paid by the bank's shareholders.
 ''It is quite something else for the very management that is accused of having lied to its shareholders to determine how much of those victims' money should be used to make the case against the management go away,'' Judge Rakoff wrote.
 The case is one of several investigations into the bank's $50 billion deal with Merrill. Andrew M. Cuomo, the attorney general of New York, is also investigating the disclosures of bonuses and Merrill's losses last year. 
 Mr. Cuomo plans to file a complaint charging individuals at Bank of America in the next two weeks, according to a person briefed on the investigation. 
 The House Committee on Government Oversight and Reform is also looking into the merger.

HEADLINE: Obama Rejects Afghanistan-Vietnam Comparison

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama rejected comparisons on Monday between the war in Afghanistan and the conflict in Vietnam a generation ago, but he expressed concern about ''the dangers of overreach'' and pledged a full debate before making further decisions on strategy. 
 The president's comments, in an interview at the White House with The New York Times and CNBC, appeared to be a response to rising unease within his own party in Congress about the possibility of the United States becoming bogged down in Afghanistan. 
 Asked whether he worried about repeating the fate of President Lyndon B. Johnson, who declined to seek re-election in 1968 as a result of the turmoil over Vietnam, Mr. Obama replied: ''You have to learn lessons from history. On the other hand, each historical moment is different. You never step into the same river twice. And so Afghanistan is not Vietnam.''
 But, he added, ''The dangers of overreach and not having clear goals and not having strong support from the American people, those are all issues that I think about all the time.''
 The president promised to weigh the recommendation of the top commander in Afghanistan, Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, on whether the United States should commit more troops. But he took issue with assertions that the job of dismantling terrorism networks can be handled by drones and other alternatives to soldiers on the ground.
 ''I assure you that if that were the case, you wouldn't see 68,000 of our young men and women deployed in Afghanistan,'' he said.
 In the interview, Mr. Obama also addressed the repercussions from his decision late last week to levy new tariffs on tires imported from China. He said that his actions and China's response would not incite a trade war.
 ''I think it's in China's interests and our interests and the world's interests to avoid protectionism, particularly just as world trade is starting to bounce back from the huge declines that we've seen in the last year,'' Mr. Obama said.
 He said that the decision would give him credibility with his labor union supporters the next time he told them a trade agreement was good for the United States.
 Mr. Obama also signaled that he thought the need for a new economic stimulus package may have abated.
 ''I have a strong inclination not to do'' a second stimulus package, he said. ''I think that most folks believe that we've now turned the corner where we might actually start seeing some positive economic growth in months to come. As you know, jobs tend to be a lagging indicator; they come last.''

HEADLINE: Tire Tariffs Are Cheered By Labor

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: PITTSBURGH 

 BODY:
As China and some American companies denounce President Obama's decision to impose tariffs on Chinese tires, the Obama administration can take solace that at least one important Democratic constituency is enthusiastically applauding the move.
 At the A.F.L.-C.I.O. convention in this city haunted by the ghosts of shuttered steel mills, Thea Lee, the labor federation's chief economist, praised Mr. Obama's decision, saying it would help preserve American manufacturing. She said a surge in Chinese tire exports had contributed to the shutdown of several American tire factories and the loss of thousands of jobs.
 ''The trade decision was the president's first down payment on his promise to more effectively enforce trade laws, and it's very much appreciated,'' Ms. Lee said on Monday, a day before Mr. Obama is to speak here at the convention of the nation's main labor federation. 
 But while union leaders are hailing Mr. Obama for, as they see it, finally standing up to China, he is having to navigate pressures from China, corporate America and the labor movement that are likely to recur in coming trade issues.
 Mr. Obama's balancing act will be especially delicate as some of the most vocal unions, like the steelworkers and auto workers, are politically powerful in Midwestern swing states.
 Last Friday night, Mr. Obama, responding to a complaint by the United Steelworkers, imposed a 35 percent tariff on Chinese tires for cars and light trucks. China quickly responded by threatening to retaliate against American auto products and chicken meat, raising fears of a possible trade war, an especially unwelcome prospect just as the global economy is struggling to recover. 
 But organized labor, having tasted success in this case, is pressing Mr. Obama to take tougher stances on a number of upcoming trade issues. Manufacturing unions, in particular, are pushing for penalties on China's steel exports, for strong Buy America provisions in future green jobs legislation and for rejecting trade pacts with Colombia and South Korea. 
 The prospect that labor might succeed scares many American companies. For one thing, any of these policies -- bound to vex America's trading partners -- could increase chances of a trade war.
 ''Retaliation is definitely a concern,'' Jeremie Waterman, senior director for China at the United States Chamber of Commerce, said of Mr. Obama's tires decision. ''Our view is that there are many more American jobs at stake if the United States fails to adopt forward-looking policies on free trade agreements and fails to resist policies like Buy America.''
 China has deplored the administration's decision, suggesting it caved to domestic support for protectionism. The Tire Industry Association, which represents American tire retailers, said the decision was ill-advised and would lead to higher prices for consumers.
 Asserting that the decision would hurt tire retailers, the association said it ''believes this was a politically motivated decision that will end up costing more jobs than it saves. These tariffs will not bring back the jobs that the union claims have been lost.''
 In a speech he gave Monday on Wall Street, Mr. Obama took a nuanced view of trade, saying a healthy economy ''depends upon our ability to buy and sell goods in markets across the globe. And make no mistake, this administration is committed to pursuing expanded trade and new trade agreements.''
 He added, ''When, as happened this weekend, we invoke provisions of existing agreements, we do so not to be provocative or to promote self-defeating protectionism. We do so because enforcing trade agreements is part and parcel of maintaining an open and free trading system.''
 Leo Gerard, president of the United Steelworkers, which filed the trade action over Chinese tires, asserted that trade policy helped the nation lose 5.6 million manufacturing jobs this decade, or nearly a third of the total. 
 His union, which represents steel, tire, paper and chemical workers, has brought repeated trade actions. The steelworkers union got 78,000 workers to write letters to the White House on the China tires issue and more than 50 members of Congress to speak out on it.
 ''We've watched almost every major sector we're privileged to represent get decimated by unfair trade,'' Mr. Gerard said. ''I hope this position that President Obama took reflects his view that we need to go back to redesign an overall trade policy that works for American workers and not just for American multinationals and Wall Street.''
 Mr. Obama ordered the tire tariffs after the United States International Trade Commission, an independent government agency, determined that a more than tripling of Chinese tire imports had disrupted the $1.7 billion tire market. It called for imposing tariffs on Chinese tires for three years.
 President George W. Bush had rejected four similar recommendations from the trade commission, angering organized labor.
 Last week the Commerce Department, concurring with a commission finding of improper subsidies, said it was imposing duties ranging from 10.9 percent to 30.6 percent on imports of Chinese pipes used to transport oil. The department is also investigating a complaint that Chinese steel manufacturers are selling pipe in the United States at unfairly low prices, with a decision due in November. 
 Fred Bergsten, director of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, an independent think tank, criticized Mr. Obama's tires decision, partly because he said it came when the administration had taken few steps to expand trade. Even so, he said China had violated trade rules by requiring some foreign-owned tire factories to export a high percentage of their output.
 ''The administration has not really enunciated a trade policy,'' Mr. Bergstein said. While noting that ''they have indicated rhetorically their opposition to protection,'' he added, ''I don't think you can resist backsliding on trade unless you're moving forward.''

HEADLINE: A Slight Uptick and a Cool Reaction to Obama's Speech

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
President Obama's speech on overhauling the financial system was interrupted once by spontaneous -- if milquetoast -- applause. That seemed to reflect Wall Street's reaction.
 Stock markets meandered on Monday afternoon as the crowds ebbed and the security and pomp accompanying Mr. Obama's visit to Lower Manhattan were dismantled. Stocks were slightly higher after Mr. Obama urged bank executives to accept new federal regulations and change the way they do business.
 ''We will not go back to the days of reckless behavior and unchecked excess that was at the heart of this crisis, where too many were motivated only by the appetite for quick kills and bloated bonuses,'' Mr. Obama said in his speech. ''Those on Wall Street cannot resume taking risks without regard for consequences, and expect that next time, American taxpayers will be there to break their fall.'' 
 Shares wavered as he spoke to the polite, if unenthusiastic, crowd of financial executives, public officials and consumer advocates. Stocks edged up in afternoon trading.
 At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average was 21.39 points, or 0.2 percent, higher at 9,626.80, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was 6.61 points, or 0.63 percent, higher at 1,049.34. The Nasdaq was up 10.88 points, or 0.52 percent, at 2,091.78. 
 With September -- historically Wall Street's worst month -- now half over, some analysts are cheered to see that stocks are up since the end of August. 
 ''There's still a lot of strategists, a lot of money managers waiting for a pullback in the market,'' said Owen Fitzpatrick, head of equity trading at Deutsche Bank Private Wealth Management. ''It will come, but it may not be as violent as we've seen in the past, just given the amount of cash that's sitting on the sidelines waiting to come in.''
 After a week containing few significant economic reports, investors this week will receive a passel of benchmarks on the economy's progress, with new figures on retail sales, wholesale and retail prices, new-home construction and industrial production.
 The day's lift suggested that investors had smoothed over concerns about a rift between the United States and China over tires, chickens and trade barriers. The Nikkei index in Japan fell 2 percent, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng fell 1 percent, and shares were mixed across Europe.
 But in New York, shares of the tire makers Goodyear and Cooper Tire and Rubber bounded higher, days after the Obama administration announced tariffs of as much as 35 percent on Chinese tires.
 The Chinese government criticized the move and suggested it would fight back by imposing trade restrictions on American exports of chickens and automotive products. Shares of chicken producers including Tyson Foods and Pilgrim's Pride each fell more than 2 percent in New York.
 Shares of Bank of America were mostly unchanged after a federal judge in New York threw out a settlement between the bank and the Securities and Exchange Commission over bonuses paid to Merrill Lynch executives as Bank of America was preparing to take over Merrill.
 Other financial shares were mostly higher. 
 Meanwhile, investors unwound some of their recent bets in other corners of the market.
 Gold prices, which soared to $1,006 an ounce last week, fell on Monday as traders cashed in some gains. Inflation-wary investors have been piling their money into gold recently, despite few signs that inflation is an imminent problem.
 And the dollar regained some ground, after sliding to its lowest levels since September. As prices of gold and copper, silver and platinum have risen, the dollar has skidded lower against those commodities and other major currencies.
 And crude oil prices fell 43 cents, to $68.86 a barrel, continuing their dance near the benchmark of $70.
 Interest rates were higher. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 21/32, to 101 22/32 and the yield rose to 3.42 percent from 3.35 percent late Friday.
 Following are the results of Monday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: Text of Obama's Speech on Financial Reform

 BODY:
Following is the text of President Obama's address on financial reform, as prepared for delivery on Monday at Federal Hall in New York and released by the White House:
 Thank you all for being here and for your warm welcome. It's a privilege to be in historic Federal Hall. It was here more than two centuries ago that our first Congress served and our first President was inaugurated. It was here, in the early days of our Republic, that Hamilton and Jefferson debated how best to administer a young economy and to ensure that our nation rewarded the talents and drive of its people. Two centuries later, we still grapple with these questions -- questions made more acute in moments of crisis. 
 It was one year ago that we experienced just such a crisis. As investors and pension-holders watched with dread and dismay, and after a series of emergency meetings often conducted in the dead of the night, several of the world's largest and oldest financial institutions had fallen, either bankrupt, bought, or bailed out: Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, AIG, Washington Mutual, Wachovia. A week before this began, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac had been taken over by the government. Other large firms teetered on the brink of insolvency. Credit markets froze as banks refused to lend not only to families and businesses but to one another. Five trillion dollars of Americans' household wealth evaporated in the span of just three months. 
 Congress and the previous administration took difficult but necessary action in the days and months that followed. Nevertheless, when this administration walked through the door in January, the situation remained urgent. The markets had fallen sharply; credit was not flowing. It was feared that the largest banks -- those that remained standing -- had too little capital and far too much exposure to risky loans. And the consequences had spread far beyond the streets of lower Manhattan. This was no longer just a financial crisis; it had become a full-blown economic crisis, with home prices sinking, businesses struggling to access affordable credit, and the economy shedding an average of 700,000 jobs each month. 
 We could not separate what was happening in the corridors of our financial institutions from what was happening on factory floors and around kitchen tables. Home foreclosures linked those who took out home loans and those who repackaged those loans as securities. A lack of access to affordable credit threatened the health of large firms and small businesses, as well as all those whose jobs depended on them. And a weakened financial system weakened the broader economy, which in turn further weakened the financial system. 
 The only way to address successfully any of these challenges was to address them together, and so this administration -- with terrific leadership by my Treasury Secretary, Tim Geithner, as well the Chair of my Council of Economic Advisers, Christy Romer, and the Chair of the National Economic Council, Larry Summers -- moved quickly on all fronts, initializing a financial stability plan to rescue the system from the crisis and restart lending for all those affected by the crisis. By opening and examining the books of large financial firms, we helped restore the availability of two things that had been in short supply: capital and confidence. By taking aggressive and innovative steps in credit markets, we spurred lending not just to banks, but to folks looking to buy homes or cars, take out student loans, or finance small businesses. Our home ownership plan has helped responsible homeowners refinance to stem the tide of lost homes and lost home values. 
 And the recovery plan is providing help to the unemployed and tax relief for working families, all while spurring consumer spending. It's prevented layoffs of tens of thousands of teachers, police officers, and other essential public servants. And thousands of recovery projects are underway all across America, putting people to work building wind turbines and solar panels, renovating schools and hospitals, and repairing our nation's roads and bridges. 
 Eight months later, the work of recovery continues. And although I will never be satisfied while people are out of work and our financial system is weakened, we can be confident that the storms of the past two years are beginning to break. 
 In fact, while there continues to be a need for government involvement to stabilize the financial system, that necessity is waning. After months in which public dollars were flowing into our financial system, we are finally beginning to see money flowing back to the taxpayers. This doesn't mean taxpayers will escape the worst financial crisis in decades unscathed. But banks have repaid more than $70 billion, and in those cases where the government's stake has been sold completely, taxpayers have actually earned a 17-percent return on their investment. Just a few months ago, many experts from across the ideological spectrum feared that ensuring financial stability would require even more tax dollars. Instead, we've been able to eliminate a $250 billion reserve included in our budget because that fear has not been realized. 
 While full recovery of the financial system will take a great deal more time and work, the growing stability resulting from these interventions means we are beginning to return to normalcy. But what I want to emphasize is this: normalcy cannot lead to complacency. 
 Unfortunately, there are some in the financial industry who are misreading this moment. Instead of learning the lessons of Lehman and the crisis from which we are still recovering, they are choosing to ignore them. They do so not just at their own peril, but at our nation's. So I want them to hear my words: We will not go back to the days of reckless behavior and unchecked excess at the heart of this crisis, where too many were motivated only by the appetite for quick kills and bloated bonuses. Those on Wall Street cannot resume taking risks without regard for consequences, and expect that next time, American taxpayers will be there to break their fall. 
 That's why we need strong rules of the road to guard against the kind of systemic risks we have seen. And we have a responsibility to write and enforce these rules to protect consumers of financial products, taxpayers, and our economy as a whole. Yes, they must be developed in a way that does not stifle innovation and enterprise. And we want to work with the financial industry to achieve that end. But the old ways that led to this crisis cannot stand. And to the extent that some have so readily returned to them underscores the need for change and change now. History cannot be allowed to repeat itself.
 Instead, we are calling on the financial industry to join us in a constructive effort to update the rules and regulatory structure to meet the challenges of this new century. That is what my administration seeks to do. We have sought ideas and input from industry leaders, policy experts, academics, consumer advocates, and the broader public. And we've worked closely with leaders in the Senate and House, including Senators Chris Dodd and Richard Shelby, and Congressman Barney Frank, who are now working to pass regulatory reform through Congress. 
 Taken together, we are proposing the most ambitious overhaul of the financial system since the Great Depression. But I want to emphasize that these reforms are rooted in a simple principle: we ought to set clear rules of the road that promote transparency and accountability. That's how we'll make certain that markets foster responsibility, not recklessness, and reward those who compete honestly and vigorously within the system, instead of those who try to game the system. 
 First, we're proposing new rules to protect consumers and a new Consumer Financial Protection Agency to enforce those rules. This crisis was not just the result of decisions made by the mightiest of financial firms. It was also the result of decisions made by ordinary Americans to open credit cards and take on mortgages. And while there were many who took out loans they knew they couldn't afford, there were also millions of Americans who signed contracts they didn't fully understand offered by lenders who didn't always tell the truth. 
 This is in part because there is no single agency charged with making sure it doesn't happen. That is what we'll change. The Consumer Financial Protection Agency will have the power to ensure that consumers get information that is clear and concise, and to prevent the worst kinds of abuses. Consumers shouldn't have to worry about loan contracts designed to be unintelligible, hidden fees attached to their mortgages, and financial penalties -- whether through a credit card or debit card -- that appear without warning on their statements. And responsible lenders, including community banks, doing the right thing shouldn't have to worry about ruinous competition from unregulated competitors. 
 Now there are those who are suggesting that somehow this will restrict the choices available to consumers. Nothing could be further from the truth. The lack of clear rules in the past meant we had innovation of the wrong kind: the firm that could make its products look best by doing the best job of hiding the real costs won. For example, we had ''teaser'' rates on credit cards and mortgages that lured people in and then surprised them with big rate increases. By setting ground rules, we'll increase the kind of competition that actually provides people better and greater choices, as companies compete to offer the best product, not the one that's most complex or confusing. 
 Second, we've got to close the loopholes that were at the heart of the crisis. Where there were gaps in the rules, regulators lacked the authority to take action. Where there were overlaps, regulators often lacked accountability for inaction. These weaknesses in oversight engendered systematic, and systemic, abuse. 
 Under existing rules, some companies can actually shop for the regulator of their choice -- and others, like hedge funds, can operate outside of the regulatory system altogether. We've seen the development of financial instruments, like derivatives and credit default swaps, without anyone examining the risks or regulating all of the players. And we've seen lenders profit by providing loans to borrowers who they knew would never repay, because the lender offloaded the loan and the consequences to someone else. Those who refuse to game the system are at a disadvantage. 
 Now, one of the main reasons this crisis could take place is that many agencies and regulators were responsible for oversight of individual financial firms and their subsidiaries, but no one was responsible for protecting the whole system. In other words, regulators were charged with seeing the trees, but not the forest. And even then, some firms that posed a ''systemic risk'' were not regulated as strongly as others, exploiting loopholes in the system to take on greater risk with less scrutiny. As a result, the failure of one firm threatened the viability of many others. We were facing one of the largest financial crises in history and those responsible for oversight were caught off guard and without the authority to act. 
 That's why we'll create clear accountability and responsibility for regulating large financial firms that pose a systemic risk. While holding the Federal Reserve fully accountable for regulation of the largest, most interconnected firms, we'll create an oversight council to bring together regulators from across markets to share information, to identify gaps in regulation, and to tackle issues that don't fit neatly into an organizational chart. We'll also require these financial firms to meet stronger capital and liquidity requirements and observe greater constraints on their risky behavior. That's one of the lessons of the past year. The only way to avoid a crisis of this magnitude is to ensure that large firms can't take risks that threaten our entire financial system, and to make sure they have the resources to weather even the worst of economic storms. 
 Even as we've proposed safeguards to make the failure of large and interconnected firms less likely, we've also proposed creating what's called ''resolution authority'' in the event that such a failure happens and poses a threat to the stability of the financial system. This is intended to put an end to the idea that some firms are ''too big to fail.'' For a market to function, those who invest and lend in that market must believe that their money is actually at risk. And the system as a whole isn't safe until it is safe from the failure of any individual institution.
 If a bank approaches insolvency, we have a process through the FDIC that protects depositors and maintains confidence in the banking system. This process was created during the Great Depression when the failure of one bank led to runs on other banks, which in turn threatened the banking system. And it works. Yet we don't have any kind of process in place to contain the failure of a Lehman Brothers or AIG or any of the largest and most interconnected financial firms in our country. 
 That's why, when this crisis began, crucial decisions about what would happen to some of the world's biggest companies -- companies employing tens of thousands of people and holding trillions of dollars in assets -- took place in hurried discussions in the middle of the night. And that's why we've had to rely on taxpayer dollars. The only resolution authority we currently have that would prevent a financial meltdown involved tapping the Federal Reserve or the federal treasury. With so much at stake, we should not be forced to choose between allowing a company to fall into a rapid and chaotic dissolution that threatens the economy and innocent people, or forcing taxpayers to foot the bill. Our plan would put the cost of a firm's failure on those who own its stock and loaned it money. And if taxpayers ever have to step in again to prevent a second Great Depression, the financial industry will have to pay the taxpayer back -- every cent. 
 Finally, we need to close the gaps that exist not just within this country but among countries. The United States is leading a coordinated response to promote recovery and to restore prosperity among both the world's largest economies and the world's fastest growing economies. At a summit in London in April, leaders agreed to work together in an unprecedented way to spur global demand but also to address the underlying problems that caused such a deep and lasting global recession. This work will continue next week in Pittsburgh when I convene the G20, which has proven to be an effective forum for coordinating policies among key developed and emerging economies and one that I see taking on an important role in the future. 
 Essential to this effort is reforming what's broken in the global financial system -- a system that links economies and spreads both rewards and risks. For we know that abuses in financial markets anywhere can have an impact everywhere; and just as gaps in domestic regulation lead to a race to the bottom, so too do gaps in regulation around the world. Instead, we need a global race to the top, including stronger capital standards, as I've called for today. As the United States is aggressively reforming our regulatory system, we will be working to ensure that the rest of the world does the same. 
 A healthy economy in the 21st Century also depends upon our ability to buy and sell goods in markets across the globe. And make no mistake, this administration is committed to pursuing expanded trade and new trade agreements. It is absolutely essential to our economic future. But no trading system will work if we fail to enforce our trade agreements. So when,as happened this weekend, we invoke provisions of existing agreements, we do so not to be provocative or to promote self-defeating protectionism. We do so because enforcing trade agreements is part and parcel of maintaining an open and free trading system.
 And just as we have to live up to our responsibilities on trade, we have to live up to our responsibilities on financial reform as well. I have urged leaders in Congress to pass regulatory reform this year and both Congressman Frank and Senator Dodd, who are leading this effort, have made it clear that that's what they intend to do. Now there will be those who defend the status quo. There will be those who argue we should do less or nothing at all. But to them I'd say only this: do you believe that the absence of sound regulation one year ago was good for the financial system? Do you believe the resulting decline in markets and wealth and employment was good for the economy? Or the American people? 
 I've always been a strong believer in the power of the free market. I believe that jobs are best created not by government, but by businesses and entrepreneurs willing to take a risk on a good idea. I believe that the role of government is not to disparage wealth, but to expand its reach; not to stifle markets, but to provide the ground rules and level playing field that helps to make them more vibrant -- and that will allow us to better tap the creative and innovative potential of our people. For we know that it is the dynamism of our people that has been the source of America's progress and prosperity.
 So I certainly did not run for President to bail out banks or intervene in the capital markets. But it is important to note that the very absence of common-sense regulations able to keep up with a fast-paced financial sector is what created the need for that extraordinary intervention. The lack of sensible rules of the road, so often opposed by those who claim to speak for the free market, led to a rescue far more intrusive than anything any of us, Democrat or Republican, progressive or conservative, would have proposed or predicted. 
 At the same time, what we must do now goes beyond just these reforms. For what took place one year ago was not merely a failure of regulation or legislation; it was not merely a failure of oversight or foresight. It was a failure of responsibility that allowed Washington to become a place where problems -- including structural problems in our financial system -- were ignored rather than solved. It was a failure of responsibility that led homebuyers and derivative traders alike to take reckless risks they couldn't afford. It was a collective failure of responsibility in Washington, on Wall Street, and across America that led to the near-collapse of our financial system one year ago. 
 Restoring a willingness to take responsibility -- even when it is hard -- is at the heart of what we must do. Here on Wall Street, you have a responsibility. The reforms I've laid out will pass and these changes will become law. But one of the most important ways to rebuild the system stronger than before is to rebuild trust stronger than before -- and you do not have to wait for a new law to do that. You don't have to wait to use plain language in your dealings with consumers. You don't have to wait to put the 2009 bonuses of your senior executives up for a shareholder vote. You don't have to wait for a law to overhaul your pay system so that folks are rewarded for long-term performance instead of short-term gains. 
 The fact is, many of the firms that are now returning to prosperity owe a debt to the American people. Though they were not the cause of the crisis, American taxpayers through their government took extraordinary action to stabilize the financial industry. They shouldered the burden of the bailout and they are still bearing the burden of the fallout -- in lost jobs, lost homes and lost opportunities. It is neither right nor responsible after you've recovered with the help of your government to shirk your obligation to the goal of wider recovery, a more stable system, and a more broadly shared prosperity. 
 So I want to urge you to demonstrate that you take this obligation to heart. To put greater effort into helping families who need their mortgages modified under my administration's homeownership plan. To help small business owners who desperately need loans and who are bearing the brunt of the decline in available credit. To help communities that would benefit from the financing you could provide, or the community development institutions you could support. To come up with creative approaches to improve financial education and to bring banking to those who live and work entirely outside the banking system. And, of course, to embrace serious financial reform, not fight it. 
 Just as we are asking the private sector to think about the long term, Washington must as well. When my administration came through the door, we not only faced a financial crisis and costly recession, we also found waiting a trillion-dollar deficit. Yes, we have had to take extraordinary action in the wake of an extraordinary economic crisis. But I am committed to putting this nation on a sound and secure fiscal footing. That's why we're pushing to restore pay-as-you-go rules, because I will not go along with the old Washington ways which said it was OK to pass spending bills and tax cuts without a plan to pay for it. That's why we're cutting programs that don't work or are out of date. And that's why I've insisted that health insurance reform not add a dime to the deficit, now or in the future. 
 There are those who would suggest that we must choose between markets unfettered by even the most modest of regulations -- and markets weighed down by onerous regulations that suppress the spirit of enterprise and innovation. But if there is one lesson we can learn from the last year, it is that this is a false choice. Common-sense rules of the road do not hinder the markets but make them stronger. Indeed, they are essential to ensuring that our markets function, and function fairly and freely.
 One year ago, we saw in stark relief how markets can err; how a lack of common-sense rules can lead to excess and abuse; how close we can come to the brink. One year later, it is incumbent on us to put in place those reforms that will prevent this kind of crisis from ever happening again; that reflect the painful but important lessons we've learned; and that will help us move from a period of recklessness and crisis to one of responsibility and prosperity. That is what we must do. And I'm confident that is what we will do.
 Thank you.

HEADLINE: Japan Airlines in Talks With U.S. Rivals

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI; Nicola Clark contributed reporting from Paris.

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
A last-ditch effort by the biggest airline in Japan to raise money and avoid bankruptcy has set the stage for a battle between Delta and American Airlines. 
 In events that would have been unimaginable a year ago, Japan Airlines, the country's flagship carrier, said Monday that it was exploring all options to stay in business. News reports said that the carrier was in talks with Delta Air Lines and American over a possible cash infusion of several hundred million dollars. 
 Despite troubles back home, United States airlines are eager to expand abroad to tap into international business travel, the most consistently lucrative segment in an industry prone to sharp downturns. Still, equity ties between airlines in different countries are rare, with most carriers settling for looser alliances like code sharing on flights. 
 A stake in Japan Airlines would bolster Delta's global standing by giving it access to lucrative trans-Pacific and Asian routes, as well as to coveted berths at Tokyo's busy international airport. 
 Delta, the world's biggest airline by miles traveled by its passengers, already has a strong foothold in Asia through Northwest Airlines, which it acquired last year. 
 But a deal between Delta and Japan Airlines would hurt American, which lacks a hub in Asia and relies on a code-sharing agreement reached with Japan Airlines in 1998. Analysts expect American to call on other members of the Oneworld alliance to also take a stake in the Japanese airliner to keep it within their ranks. 
 Delta declined to comment, while a spokesman for American said the airline was ''discussing deepening our relationship with Japan Airlines,'' and declined to comment further. 
 Both airlines are jockeying for position amid recent talks that could open up routes between the United States and Japan to greater competition. Current restrictions allow only two United States passenger airlines -- Delta and United Airlines -- to fly between the main airport serving Tokyo, Narita, and cities in the United States.
 Delta could have a lot to lose if more United States airlines were allowed to fly to Narita, analysts say. A stake in Japan Airlines would better position Delta for continued dominance of trans-Pacific routes. 
 But an investment in a carrier on the brink of bankruptcy could also pose big risks. Delta, still integrating its $2.6 billion purchase of Northwest, lost $1.05 billion in the first six months of 2009. 
 ''Several hundred million dollars would not be enough to save Japan Airlines,'' said Yasuhiro Matsumoto, an analyst at Shinsei Securities. ''It could still go under, unless it gets even more funding.'' 
 If Delta were to invest $300 million to $500 million in Japan Airlines, as some reports have suggested, the carrier would become its largest shareholder, with 7 percent to 11 percent of its shares. Laws in Japan prevent foreign companies from owning more than a third of a Japanese airline. 
 Japan Airlines, known as JAL, hopes that a cash infusion from either Delta or American will persuade other creditors to offer additional loans. The cash would also let the Japanese airline upgrade to newer, more fuel-efficient aircraft and turn around money-losing routes by teaming up with a new partner. 
 ''If JAL could be turned around, then whoever is involved could really reap some great benefits,'' said Jim Eckes, managing director of Indoswiss Aviation, a Hong Kong consulting firm. ''But I don't think the potential investors have really dug in deeply yet. If they look at JAL more closely, it may not be as attractive as it looks from the outside.''
 Hurt by years of mismanagement, a falloff in air travel and the weakness of the Japanese economy, Japan Airlines reported a record quarterly loss of 99 billion yen ($1 billion), in the three months ended June 30. It has already forecast a 63 billion yen loss for the fiscal year, which ends next March, and the airline has announced plans to reduce flights. Although it recently secured 100 billion yen in government-backed loans, analysts say the airline needs at least 250 billion yen to get through the year. 
 Japan Airlines is mired in negotiations with its eight unions over staff and pay cuts, holding back the company's restructuring efforts. The company's holdings, which include a global hotel chain and credit card business, have also drained its resources. Meanwhile, the carrier is losing out to its rival, All Nippon Airways, on domestic routes. 
 The outgoing government in Japan, controlled by the Liberal Democratic Party, had sought desperately to prop up the ailing airline over the last decade. Some analysts said the landmark victory of the rival Democratic Party in elections last month may have put new pressure on Japan Airlines to find new investors. 
 ''This new government may want to put JAL's feet to the fire,'' Mr. Eckes said. ''There is room for something dramatic to be done, but there is still a question as to whether it is acceptable politically to see either Delta or American come in and rescue a national icon like JAL.'' 
 Some Democratic politicians have hinted at the possibility of letting Japan Airlines fail.
 ''Bankruptcy proceedings would not be received well by the Japanese public,'' said Hirotaka Yamauchi, a professor at Hitotsubashi University and a member of a government advisory panel on revamping the airline.
 The airline was set to report to the panel on its talks with Delta and American on Tuesday. 

CORRECTION-DATE: September 29, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An article on Sept. 15 about Japan Airlines' battle to stay out of bankruptcy misstated the restrictions on United States passenger airline flights between Tokyo's main airport, Narita, and American cities. While Delta and United Airlines are the only carriers allowed unrestricted flights, they are not the only airlines allowed to fly into and out of Narita. Four others -- American Airlines, Continental Airlines, US Airways and Hawaiian Airlines -- are allowed restricted numbers of flights.

HEADLINE: Are Condoms the Ultimate Green Technology?

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: Are condoms and other forms of family planning the cheapest green technology? 

 BODY:
More children equal more carbon dioxide emissions. And recent research has resulted in renewed coverage of the notion that one of the cheapest ways to curb emissions in coming decades would be to provide access to birth control for tens of millions of women around the world who say they desire it. A study by researchers at the London School of Economics and commissioned by the Optimum Population Trust came to the following conclusion:
Contraception is 'Greenest' Technology
U.N. data suggest that meeting unmet need for family planning would reduce unintended births by 72 per cent, reducing projected world population in 2050 by half a billion to 8.64 billion. Between 2010 and 2050 12 billion fewer "people-years" would be lived - 326 billion against 338 billion under current projections. The 34 gigatons of CO2 saved in this way would cost $220 billion - roughly $7 a ton [metric tons]. However, the same CO2 saving would cost over $1trillion if low-carbon technologies were used. (Here's a link to a pdf of the report.)
I recently raised the question of whether this means we'll soon see a market in baby-avoidance carbon credits similar to efforts to sell CO2 credits for avoiding deforestation. This is purely a thought experiment, not a proposal. But the issue is one that is rarely discussed in climate treaty talks or in debates over United States climate legislation. If anything, the population-climate question is more pressing in the United States than in developing countries, given the high per-capita carbon dioxide emissions here and the rate of population growth. If giving women a way to limit family size is such a cheap win for emissions, why isn't it in the mix?

HEADLINE: House Panel Resists Changes in NASA Space Program

BYLINE: By KENNETH CHANG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Members of a key House committee said Tuesday that they were reluctant to change NASA's current plans for human spaceflight after the space shuttles are retired from service, beyond giving more money to the agency.
 ''I think that good public policy argues for setting the bar pretty high against making significant changes in direction at this point,'' said Representative Bart Gordon, Democrat of Tennessee, who is chairman of the Committee on Science and Technology. ''There would need to be a compelling reason to scrap what we've invested our time and money in over these past four years.''
 Mr. Gordon's remarks came during the first Congressional hearing on a new report that offers options for the future of astronauts in space. 
 NASA is developing a new series of rockets to replace the space shuttles, which are scheduled to be retired next year. 
 The Obama administration has not offered public support for the rockets, which are part of the agency's Constellation program, and in May convened a panel to review the program.
 Norman Augustine, a former chief executive of Lockheed Martin who led the 10-member review panel, encountered a sometimes testy atmosphere in his appearance before the committee on Tuesday.
 ''I am pretty angry,'' said Gabrielle Giffords, Democrat of Arizona, who heads the committee's Space and Aeronautics Subcommittee. 
 Ms. Giffords said she had been hoping for a detailed evaluation of Constellation and recommendations for how to improve it. Instead, she said, the panel had provided a menu of potential replacements for the program. 
 ''We have a glancing attention to Constellation, even mentioning it in past tense,'' she said.
 But Mr. Augustine said the panel had done what had been requested -- provide a list of options, not a preferred recommendation -- and noted that the Constellation program was one of the five options offered. 
 ''We believe the existing program is a fine program,'' he said. 
 The panel issued a 12-page summary last week, and Mr. Augustine said it would try to complete the report this month. 
 Committee members agreed with Mr. Augustine on a central conclusion of the panel: NASA needs about $3 billion more a year -- increasing the spending over the next decade on human spaceflight to $130 billion from $100 billion -- or it will not be able to accomplish the goals of Constellation or any alternative program.
 Without an increase, Mr. Augustine said, NASA could continue to operate the International Space Station and develop some new technology, but it would not get out of Earth orbit for the foreseeable future. ''It will be a program that will inspire very few people,'' he said. 
 A smaller increase of $1.5 billion a year was also insufficient, the panel concluded. 
 In addition, it said that none of the options appreciably shortens the gap between the retirement of the shuttles -- when the United States will rely on Russia for transportation to and from the International Space Station -- and the development of the Ares I. 
 The Ares, the first of the Constellation rockets, will not be ready for use until at least 2015, and the panel predicted that the schedule would slip to 2017.
 Mr. Augustine, who spent two hours before the House committee, will be questioned by the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee on Wednesday.
 Also testifying to the House committee on Tuesday were Michael D. Griffin, the former NASA administrator who stepped down in January with the change in administrations, and Joseph W. Dyer, a retired vice admiral who is chairman of the aerospace advisory panel at NASA.
 Dr. Griffin agreed that the fundamental issue is money, pointing out that NASA's budget was cut 20 percent in 1994. In inflation-adjusted dollars, NASA's budget is lower than it was in 1993. ''I think we're here today because we don't like how that experiment turned out,'' he said.
 To cancel Ares I and rely on commercial companies to provide transportation to orbit, a suggestion made by the review panel, would be ''risky in the extreme,'' Dr. Griffin said. ''That day is not yet and is not soon.''
 Dr. Griffin also said that NASA had been much more careful in preparing its cost estimates for Constellation and that the review panel had not taken that into account. 
 Mr. Dyer said that the safety panel did not support extending operations of the space shuttle, another of the options offered by the review panel. 
 He also said that NASA had not held detailed conversations with commercial companies about what would be necessary to make their rockets sufficiently safe for passengers.

HEADLINE: Bright Spot Amid Job Losses

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: Leonhardt@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Last winter, stories of companies cutting their workers' pay were everywhere. FedEx said in December that it would reduce the pay of salaried workers by 5 percent. Caterpillar announced it would cut pay by up to 15 percent. The employees of a General Motors dealership near Philadelphia agreed to work one week for minimum wage.
 For the first time since perhaps the Great Depression, it seemed possible that average hourly pay would actually begin falling, even before inflation was taken into account. 
 But that's not what has happened. 
 Wage growth has picked up in the last several months, according to twodifferent government surveys. You don't hear or read nearly as many stories about pay cuts these days. Even though unemployment has reached its highest level in 26 years, most workers have received a raise over the last year.
 That contrast highlights what I think is one of the more overlooked features of the Great Recession. In the job market, at least, the recession's pain has been unusually concentrated.
 And it hasn't been concentrated in the typical way. Nearly every region and every demographic group has indeed been affected. But the pain has been concentrated within groups. 
 People who have lost their jobs are struggling terribly to find new ones. Since the downturn began in 2007, companies have been extremely reluctant to hire new workers, and few new companies have started. The economy and the job market are churning very slowly.
 ''There are thousands of people applying for every job I'm looking at,'' Rick Alexander, an unemployed master carpenter in Florida, told my colleague Michael Luo. ''And potential employers won't even give me the courtesy of acknowledging I applied.'' Almost five million of the officially unemployed -- those still looking for work -- have now been out of work for 27 weeks or longer. In the six decades that the Labor Department has been keeping records, that group has never been a larger share of the work force than it is today.
 Yet there is a flip side to the lack of churn. Instead of doing lots of firing and some hiring, many companies have done only some firing and virtually no hiring, the statistics show. And that isn't all bad. 
 Try thinking of it this way: All of the unemployed people in the country are gathered in a huge gymnasium that's been turned into a job search center. The fact that this recession is the worst in a generation means that there are many, many people in the gym. The fact that the economy is churning so slowly means that there is not much traffic into and out of the gym. 
 If you're inside, you will have a hard time getting out. Yet if you're lucky enough to be outside the gym, you will probably be able to stay there. The consequences of a job loss are terribly high, but -- given that the unemployment rate is almost 10 percent -- the odds of job loss are surprisingly low. 
 The reasons for the slow churn are obviously complex. The baby boomers are moving out of the ages at which people typically start businesses. The economy has shifted away from sectors, like manufacturing, in which temporary layoffs are common. Educational gains have slowed, which affects innovation. And the federal government was not willing, at least until recently, to make the kind of investments that spurred entrepreneurship in the past -- building the highway system, supporting scientific research, creating the Pentagon computer network that turned into the Internet.
 But whatever the causes, the effects of the slow churn are clear: the pain of this recession has been concentrated. That's all the more true now that wages may be rising again.
 The story about falling wages was -- and remains -- a reasonable one. 
 ''There's been a huge shift in power in recent years from labor to capital,'' as the astute financial blogger Felix Salmonhas written. Labor unions have shrunk, and companies can move operations to lower-wage countries. ''Now that workers have lost their negotiating leverage,'' Mr. Salmon wrote after FedEx made its announcement, ''we might start seeing more across-the-board pay cuts.'' If the economy were to weaken again, we still might.
 So far, though, we haven't. Between the collapse of Lehman Brothers last September and this June, the average weekly pay of rank-and-file workers (who make up 80 percent of the work force) remained stuck at about $612. Hourly pay rose a bit, but the increase was canceled out by a shrinking workweek. Since June -- with the economy apparently starting to grow again, as Ben Bernanke noted on Tuesday -- the workweek has grown and hourly pay growth has accelerated. Last month, average weekly pay rose to $618. 
 Most companies have evidently decided that pay cuts aren't worth the downside. Economists refer to this phenomenon as the sticky-wage theory, and it seems to have survived the Great Recession. 
 The theory holds that executives of companies don't cut pay, even when demand for labor has fallen. They worry that employees will become less motivated or start looking for another job, says Laury Sejen, who oversees the compensation consultants at Watson Wyatt. So companies instead lay off workers or stop hiring. They concentrate the pain. 
 The added wrinkle in this recession is that inflation has dropped below zero, thanks largely to a sharp fall in energy prices. In most recessions, inflation remains positive -- indeed, higher than wage growth, which means that inflation-adjusted pay declines. In this recession, average prices have fallen 2 percent over the past year, while weekly pay has either been flat or risen 1 percent, depending on which data you believe. 
 So inflation-adjusted pay is up 2 to 3 percent. Amazingly enough, that's almost as big as the peak increases during the late 1990s boom. 
 I realize how strange this sounds. (I work at one of the companies that did cut pay.) House values have sunk, and 401(k) accounts remain battered. In the years leading up to the recession, pay increases for most families were meager. The Census Bureaureported last week that median real household income -- which, of course, includes households that have suffered a job loss -- was lower last year than a full decade earlier. 
 But we're still in unusual territory. The economy is just emerging from a severe recession, yet the pay of most workers has been rising. That wasn't the case at the end of any other recent recession.
 I hope you can keep this in mind if you're one of those fortunate enough to be outside the metaphorical gymnasium and still working. The economy surely doesn't feel healthy right now. But just imagine how it feels to everybody who has borne the brunt of the recession.

DANCING IN THE DARK
 A Cultural History of the Great Depression
 By Morris Dickstein
 598 pages. W. W. Norton & Company. $29.95.
 A few years ago in The London Review of Books, Ferdinand Mount complained about ''decaditis,'' the slightly absurd notion that ''slicing the past up into periods of 10 years'' is a useful thing to do. ''Historians used to deal in reigns and centuries,'' Mr. Mount wrote. He added: ''As far as I can see, the 1890s was the first tenner to be identified, and quite quickly identified, as having its own inimitable aroma.''
 In the last American century, only two decades genuinely pricked up the nostrils (as Mr. Mount might put it), the 1930s and the 1960s. Fundamentally different eras, they had a similarity. Political dissent -- stoked by economic crisis in one case, an unwinnable war in the other -- supplied radical thunder, while the best artists, who seemed to come out of nowhere, threw zigzagging lightning strikes that have retained their heat and illuminating light. 
 The critic Morris Dickstein has already written an authoritative cultural history of the '60s, ''Gates of Eden'' (1977), a book warmed by injections of his own experiences during the decade and by his willingness occasionally to shoot from the hip. He called ''The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test,'' by Tom Wolfe, ''stupefyingly boring -- I got through only half of it.''
 Mr. Dickstein returns now with ''Dancing in the Dark: A Cultural History of the Great Depression,'' a sprawling bundle of ruminations on the books, music, art, movies and design of the 1930s. It's a heavier, slower, more lumbering book, at times a hard-drive-emptying round of plot summaries and historical filler.
 Mr. Dickstein remains a serious and perceptive critic, however, adept at observations both macro (''Epic scenes from the Dust Bowl are part of our permanent shorthand for rural poverty and natural desolation'') and micro. He describes the subject of ''Migrant Mother,'' Dorothea Lange's searing 1936 photograph, as ''a woman whose brow is furrowed like tractored-out land.'' 
 ''Dancing in the Dark'' is an extended meditation on what Mr. Dickstein calls ''the crucial role that culture can play in times of national trial.'' In the '30s it was a decidedly dual role. ''The crisis kindled America's social imagination,'' he notes, ''firing enormous interest in how ordinary people lived, how they suffered, interacted, took pleasure in one another, and endured.''
 At the same time, audiences fled toward escapist entertainment. About the decade's split personality, Mr. Dickstein asks: ''How can one era have produced both Woody Guthrie and Rudy Vallee, both the Rockettes high-stepping at the Radio City Music Hall and the Okies on their desperate trek?'' 
 Mr. Dickstein doesn't and perhaps can't reconcile the decade's many overlapping strands. But it's when writing about Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, interestingly enough, that he shyly verges on a thesis statement, as if speaking to our moment as well as to the '30s. ''Dancing in the dark,'' he notes, ''is a way of asserting a life-saving grace, unity and style against the encroaching darkness.''
 Born in 1940, Mr. Dickstein obviously doesn't have the direct experience of the '30s he had of the 1960s. But his book nonetheless has an elusive personal quality that derives from his aesthetic choices. He's made no effort to cover everything, he admits. He focuses on ''unusually complex, enduring works for what they reveal about the age.''
 Thus he dips deeply into the work of Henry Roth, Nathanael West and James Agee, three writers whose best work during the '30s wouldn't be recognized for decades. About West's writing, he acutely notes that the ''transformation of weakness or sympathy into violence is like the buried underside of the radical altruism of Depression writing, a streak of sadism submerged within that torrent of pity.''
 He reprises the running feud between Richard Wright and Zora Neale Hurston. She thought his ''Native Son'' missed the shared experience and more joyful essence of black life, focusing instead on powerlessness and fear. Wright responded that Hurston's characters ''swing like a pendulum eternally in that safe and narrow orbit in which America likes to see the Negro live: between laughter and tears.''
 Mr. Dickstein also zeroes in on the flaw in most of the decade's proletarian writing, what he calls ''the surprising fatalism, the ideologically enforced pattern of victimization.''
 He charts the rise of gangster films as ''immigrant fables,'' captures the ''coiled energy'' of Edward G. Robinson, Paul Muni and James Cagney's best performances and -- because socially committed scholars pay little attention to them -- dilates on comedies like ''Bringing Up Baby.'' 
 Mr. Dickstein sometimes wears his big, corny heart on his sleeve. He weeps during ''It's a Wonderful Life'' (a 1946 movie influenced by the '30s); he struggles mightily to overcome a dislike of Bing Crosby; he thrills to the music of George and Ira Gershwin, especially the way their rhymes ''spice romantic feeling with an essentially comic flavor, harnessing wit to wooing, as Shakespeare's comic heroes always did.''
 ''Criticism is personal or it is nothing,'' Mr. Dickstein wrote in his 1992 book, ''Double Agent: The Critic and Society.'' The shreds of first person in ''Dancing in the Dark'' go a long way.
 The book has its blind spots. Mr. Dickstein's chapter on poetry deals at length with three writers, Robert Frost, Wallace Stevens and William Carlos Williams, who don't seem entirely representative of the era, while avoiding Archibald MacLeish, Muriel Rukeyser, Hart Crane and Allen Tate.
 A more nagging problem with ''Dancing in the Dark'' is that Mr. Dickstein has learned too well the lesson of Rotary speakers, which is that people pay keen attention only to first and last things. Thus he front-loads (and back-loads) his book's sections with his essential thoughts, and stirs almost anything -- mostly his plot summaries -- into the lumpen middle.
 Mr. Dickstein's best writing, however, is nearly a cure for decaditis.

HEADLINE: An Agency Merger May Signal Optimism

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
THE advertising industry has been hit hard by the recession, but there are some hopeful signs beginning to appear along Madison Avenue.
 A case in point: the growth plans of an independent Midwestern agency, Laughlin/Constable. The agency is expanding to New York City, considered to be the toughest ad market to crack regardless of economic conditions.
 Laughlin/Constable will announce on Wednesday a merger with Partners & Jeary, an independent agency opened three years ago by Michael Jeary, a longtime New York advertising executive. Partners & Jeary will become the New York office of Laughlin/Constable, which has its headquarters in Milwaukee along with an office in Chicago. 
 Mr. Jeary, president and chief executive of Partners & Jeary, becomes president of what is being called Laughlin/Constable New York. Steven L. Laughlin continues as partner at Laughlin/Constable, overseeing the Milwaukee and Chicago operations.
 ''Maybe we're crazy'' to try growing now, Mr. Laughlin, who goes by Steve, said in a telephone interview. ''I wake up nervous about the business every morning, or I go to bed nervous every night.''
 ''On the other hand, you can't take a time-out during a recession,'' he added. ''You can't turn off opportunities or stop thinking aggressively.''
 ''If overall marketing isn't growing, you have to take share from competitors,'' Mr. Laughlin said, and a presence in the largest ad market in the United States ought to help make the agency more appealing to potential clients.
 Indeed, some advertisers, seeking to save money on meetings, flights and other expenses, are looking for agencies closer to home. For instance, Heineken USA, which is opening a marketing headquarters in Manhattan, recently shifted the creative duties for two beer brands, Heineken and Heineken Premium Light, to the New York office of Euro RSCG Worldwide, part of Havas, from the Portland, Ore., office of Wieden & Kennedy.
 Still, Mr. Laughlin said, expansion plans need to ''balance risk and reward.'' To hedge his bets, he decided to take over an existing agency rather than start a New York office from scratch.
 And he and Mr. Jeary have known each other for more than a decade, both men said, and have talked for some time about working together.
 ''To be honest with you,'' Mr. Laughlin said, ''we probably wouldn't have looked at New York as aggressively as we did without me having the connection with Michael.''
 The path Mr. Laughlin is following is a familiar one. When Laughlin/Constable -- which began in Milwaukee in 1976 as Frankenberry, Laughlin & Constable -- expanded to Chicago in 1998, it was through an acquisition, buying the Chicago office of N. W. Ayer & Partners from the MacManus Group. And the local management was kept in place.
 ''The first and most important thing is to have key senior local talent in whatever city you're opening in,'' said Peter G. Krivkovich, president and chief executive at Cramer-Krasselt in Chicago. When he opened a New York office in 2004, he hired executives with extensive experience in the market to run it.
 As challenging as it is to come into New York, Mr. Krivkovich said, he said he was ''absolutely'' glad to have done so, adding, ''I frankly wish I had done it several years sooner.''
 On the other hand, many agencies that have expanded into New York have struggled; some, like Fallon Worldwide and M&C Saatchi, eventually gave up and closed their New York offices.
 Financial terms of the agreement between Laughlin/Constable and Partners & Jeary are not being disclosed. The eight full-time employees of Partners & Jeary will join Laughlin/Constable, which has more than 150 employees and billings estimated at more than $200 million from clients like Bridgestone/Firestone, Kimberly-Clark, Master Lock and Steelcase.
 Partners & Jeary, which was opened in 2006, has been one of three members of the Partners Group, an agency network with an entrepreneurial bent, along with Partners & Napier in Rochester and Partners & Edell in Toronto. Mr. Jeary will leave the Partners Group, he said, as a result of his deal to join Laughlin/Constable.
 ''I was a start-up, and the others were established agencies with more capabilities to go forward,'' Mr. Jeary said, particularly ''as the economy tightened up.''
 ''So when Steve brought up the opportunity in December, I was happy to embrace it,'' he added.
 Sharon Napier, president and chief executive at Partners & Napier, said the Partners Group would go forward with her agency and Partners & Edell.
 To compensate for the loss of Partners & Jeary, Ms. Napier said, she hoped to open by the end of the year a field office in New York for Partners & Napier as part of plans to ''create a New York State strategy'' for the agency.
 Mr. Jeary spent more than two decades at Saatchi & Saatchi before leaving in 1997 to join Jerry Della Femina's agency, Jerry & Ketchum, which was renamed Della Femina Jeary & Partners. By the time he left in 2006 to open Partners & Jeary, the agency was known as Della Femina Rothschild Jeary & Partners, a name it has retained.
 The rebranding of Partners & Jeary as Loughlin/Constable New York means that Mr. Jeary's previous agency will bear his name -- but not his current one.
 ''I've had my name on enough agencies,'' Mr. Jeary said, laughing. ''We should build this brand,'' he added, referring to Laughlin/Constable.

 CORRECTION:
A picture caption on Wednesday with the Advertising column, about the expansion plans of Laughlin/Constable, an independent Midwestern agency, misstated the title that Michael Jeary will hold after his agency, Partners & Jeary, merges with Laughlin/Constable. As the article reported, Mr. Jeary becomes president of Laughlin/Constable New York, not president and chief executive of Laughlin/Constable.
