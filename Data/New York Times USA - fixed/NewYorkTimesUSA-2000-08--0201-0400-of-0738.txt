HEADLINE: Flush With Cash, New York Gets Highest Credit Rating in 9 Years

BYLINE: By ERIC LIPTON 

 BODY:
New York City's credit rating was upgraded yesterday by Moody's Investors Service to its highest level in nine years, a change that officials estimated could save the city several million dollars.
The rating was raised to A2 from A3 . That rating is still lower than that of 9 of the nation's 11 other largest cities, Moody's said. But it stands in stark contrast to ratings from 25 years ago, when New York City was in such poor shape that it could not borrow money on its own. 
 Moody's analysis credited the city's booming economy and solid financial management for the upgrade. The city just ended its fourth fiscal year with a record budget surplus. In the most recent year, which ended on June 30, the city had an estimated surplus of $3.2 billion.
"It reflects our view that the city is now better able to weather a downturn in the economy while maintaining a budget balance," Robert A. Kurtter, a public finance analyst for Moody's, said of the upgrade.
New York City still has a relatively large amount of outstanding debt, forcing it to spend a big chunk of its annual tax revenue on those bills. And some fiscal monitors have warned that the city could face large budget deficits as soon as 2002.
But the Moody's report noted that Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani moved last month to curtail spending in the current fiscal year, 2001, and to limit a previously announced tax cut plan to try to ensure balanced budgets without major trauma.
The intricate system of rating bonds helps determine how much interest the city must pay on money it borrows to build schools, roads, courthouses and other projects, because investors are willing to accept lower interest payments from governments that are considered financially healthy. Moody's last upgraded the rating in February 1998.
"It is an affirmation and positive report on the progress we have been making," said Adam L. Barsky, director of Mr. Giuliani's Office of Management and Budget.
The city does not plan to issue new bonds until late this year, when it will probably seek to borrow about $550 million, Mr. Barsky said, adding to $26.2 billion in outstanding general obligation bonds. The city is asking the other two major bond-rating agencies for an upgrade. Mr. Barsky estimated the city's savings at millions of dollars per year.

HEADLINE: Fuel Bills Empty Poor Pockets, Left Unfilled by Boom

BYLINE: By NEELA BANERJEE 

DATELINE: BROOKLYN, Iowa

 BODY:
Every weekday, Darrell Messersmith helps his wife, Donna, into their 1989 Chevrolet Caprice, loads her wheelchair and cane into the trunk and drives 22 miles to a hospital in Grinnell. Since having a stroke in May, Mrs. Messersmith, who is 54, has spent a few hours there each afternoon learning to walk and talk again.
Once middle class, the couple was already sliding down the economic ladder, living on Mr. Messersmith's $1,300 monthly disability check after he was hurt on the job a few years back. So when gasoline prices spiked to $1.80 here this summer, the 220 miles a week of commuting to the hospital took food out of their mouths. And with natural-gas prices projected to drive the heating bill up by almost 50 percent this winter, the Messersmiths expect to cut deeper. 
 "We can't get all the food we want," Mr. Messersmith, 55, said. "We've eliminated almost all meat. We will probably cut back more on food. That's the first place you cut back on."
The Messersmiths are among millions of low-income Americans, the rural and urban poor alike, who are untouched by the flourishing economy and, as a result, unprotected from the effects of rising fuel and utility prices.
The middle class and the affluent -- despite significant increases in the cost of gasoline, heating fuels and electricity after years of relatively low prices -- in the main have not changed their driving habits or let their homes become uncomfortably warm. Indeed, their seemingly insatiable demand for fuel has helped push prices even higher.
But for the poor, mounting fuel prices and heating bills inflict painful choices, especially in cities without adequate public transportation and in small towns and suburbs where distances make driving a necessity.
Here in Iowa, according to a new study by the State Department of Human Rights, many low-income families who faced higher rates for natural gas during last year's relatively mild winter cut back on food, health care, phones and electricity to pay for heat. With prices rising, the department says that situation could worsen this year.
"Low-income people feel the most pain, whether we're looking at heating oil or gasoline or what we expect with natural gas in the winter," said Dan W. Reicher, assistant United States energy secretary and head of the Office of Energy Efficiency. "People have had to choose between heating and eating."
High utility and gasoline bills have begun to erode the budgets of the poor at a time when federal assistance programs have shrunk. This year, Congress allocated $1.1 billion to the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which helps poor families with heating bills and home repairs improve energy efficiency. That is about half the financing the program received in 1985 -- only 33 percent, if inflation is taken into account. The program has no budget for determining how many people need aid, or how many are going without.
Those most vulnerable to fuel price increases are people on fixed incomes, like retirees, and the working poor, most of whom receive little or no state assistance.
In San Diego, where electric bills have more than doubled this summer, about 27 percent of the 900,000 families affected by the higher prices fall into these groups.
In New York, deregulation has freed utilities to raise electric rates an average of 30 percent this summer. Mike Zevon has moved in with his disabled mother in Forest Hills, Queens, for fear she could not make ends meet on her monthly assistance payment of $490.
The $1,400 a month that Mr. Zevon takes home from his job as a social worker helps. But the family's electric bill more than doubled, to $240, in June, and gasoline in the neighborhood has risen to $1.99 a gallon, from $1.49 a year ago.
"By the end of the week, we scrounge for change to fill the tank," Mr. Zevon, 29, said.
The squeeze will get tighter on low-income New Yorkers in October, when annual rent increases go into effect for rent-stabilized apartments. After authorizing increases of 2 percent to 4 percent each of the last four years, the city's Rent Guidelines Board voted a 4 percent to 6 percent rise this year, based primarily on the higher cost of heating oil. The decision affects about 600,000 households.
Lower-than-normal temperatures have allowed the northern Midwest, including Iowa, to escape high utility bills so far this summer. But the region has weathered some of the steepest increases in fuel costs.
In May, just as Mrs. Messersmith was felled by her stroke, gasoline in Brooklyn rose to about $1.80 a gallon; Mr. Messersmith, a former truck driver, was spending about $400 a month to visit his wife at a hospital in Des Moines, about 75 miles east. The price of gasoline has since declined all over the region, falling to about $1.49 a gallon, but that is 40 cents a gallon more than Mr. Messersmith paid a year ago.
High gasoline prices in the Midwest prompted the federal government to investigate accusations of price-gouging by oil companies. But most analysts believe that gasoline prices have risen mainly because of the demand bred by economic growth. Salaries have grown faster than the rate of inflation, which means consumers can afford more. So while Americans grumble about fuel prices, the most recent survey of motorists by the American Automobile Association indicated that few are driving less.
And though the affluent use more energy in their homes, the poor bear the impact of higher prices. In 1998, a middle-class family spent 2.6 percent of its net income on heating bills, according to the federal heating assistance program, while the typical low-income family spent 10.1 percent. In Iowa, the Department of Human Rights study found that low-income residents last winter devoted nearly 20 percent of their income to heating costs; the Messersmiths, for example, spent 19 percent of their income on propane for their home.
"Around the country, there's an affordability crisis among low-income people," said Jerry McKim, the author of the Iowa report.
In the Iowa study, released in June, more than 12 percent of the 3,661 respondents said they cut back on food this past winter to pay fuel bills. More than 1 in 5 said they had gone without medical care. Nearly a third said they had not paid other bills to keep up with heating costs.
Poverty stays hidden amid the pin-dot towns and prim clapboard homes of Marshall, Tama and Poweshiek Counties, about 80 miles north and east of Des Moines. The lush sea of soybean and corn gives no hint of the many family farms that have closed or are about to. The counties, neighbors, are poorer than most in the state. The meatpacking plants and other factories that employed residents have shut down or cut back.
Gale Gies feels lucky that she drives only 30 miles a day round trip from her house in Garwin, in Tama County, to her job in the town of Tama. As a counselor with the Mid-Iowa energy assistance program, she helps low-income families apply for federal aid. But Mrs. Gies, 37, turns to the state for the same help she pursues for clients. Her husband, Alan, has been unable to work for three years because of degenerative arthritis, she says. Because he was denied federal disability assistance, the Gieses and their three children make do on Mrs. Gies's small salary.
To make ends meet after paying rent and fuel, the Gieses go without.
"Alan spends a lot of time in pain, because I can't afford his medicine," said Mrs. Gies, sitting on her porch one afternoon. "The muscle relaxants and pain relievers for his back would cost $60 a month, and that's $60 we just don't have."
Two years ago, when the Messersmiths were healthy, they earned about $3,000 a month. But Mr. Messersmith's disability payments after his injury went to the wrong address, and by the time he corrected the oversight, a bank had foreclosed on the couple's house in Des Moines. They moved to a trailer on land here in Brooklyn they bought years ago, on the edge of a ravine choked with hickory and wild daisies, and now they are slowly building a house with the help of their grown sons.
This summer, the house remains little more than a shell, as Mr. Messersmith, a round-faced man with a firecracker laugh, takes care of his wife. Her right side is paralyzed, so she relies on a wheelchair and speaks with normal intonation but in unrecognizable half-words.
The couple spends $300 on building materials every month and a similar amount on Mrs. Messersmith's medicines. Last winter, the Messersmiths received about $300 from the federal assistance program, enough to cover one month's propane bill.
They expect to apply for aid again.
"I had been able to do anything I wanted before, and now it's hard," Mr. Messersmith said, "because I've gone from being independent to, now, I need to ask for help."
He looked at his wife and patted her hand as she sat quietly in her wheelchair. "So I guess in one form, I understand how she feels."

Gore and Lieberman Make Tolerance the Centerpiece
Vice President Al Gore formally introduced Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut as his Democratic running mate, portraying the selection of Mr. Lieberman, an Orthodox Jew, as a measure of his devotion to tolerance and his willingness to break barriers. A1
 
The selection of Senator Lieberman has prompted a barrage of anti-Semitic comments in online chat rooms and on Internet message boards, leading some online services to start purging offensive postings. A18
 
On some issues, including those that affect the insurance industry, Mr. Lieberman has been much more of a business ally than Mr. Gore. Mr. Lieberman has also been an ally of other companies that Mr. Gore has blasted in recent speeches, including pharmaceuticals. A18
 
The announcement that her husband would be Vice President Gore's running mate thrust Hadassah Lieberman into the type of highly public role she has worked hard to avoid as a political spouse. A18

HEADLINE: Revival Time in Nashville

 BODY:
If Al Gore wins this election, he may well look back on yesterday's boisterous gathering in Nashville as the moment the campaign became truly his own and not merely an extension of the Clinton presidency. The presence of Senator Joseph Lieberman on the rostrum, standing side by side with Mr. Gore in matching white shirtsleeves, seemed to stir both men and give the Gore campaign a jolt of energy and passion. This was partly the result of Mr. Lieberman's own boyish delight at having been chosen as Mr. Gore's running mate and his obvious relish for the political combat ahead. But the mere fact that Mr. Gore had made a groundbreaking choice was itself an important event, giving the campaign a sense of completeness and purpose it had missed.
This is now Al Gore's campaign, and it could not have been an accident that President Clinton's name was not mentioned once in nearly 50 minutes of speechmaking from Mr. Gore, Mr. Lieberman and their wives. Clearly the Gore-Lieberman strategy will be to distance themselves from Mr. Clinton on the character issue while clinging to the fact that he has bequeathed them a strong economy on which to base their campaign. Mr. Lieberman, in fact, spoke glowingly of the millions of new jobs created in the last eight years and borrowed a line that the senior George Bush used to good effect in his 1988 presidential campaign: "If you have to change horses in midstream, doesn't it make sense to get on the one that's going in the right direction?" 
 Mr. Lieberman, the first Senate Democrat to rebuke Mr. Clinton for his behavior in the Lewinsky affair, said nothing yesterday about the president's conduct. But by his words, and references to his devout faith as an Orthodox Jew, he made clear he was ready to provide a firewall against Republican claims that only a Bush-Cheney victory could restore dignity and integrity to the White House. His wife, Hadassah, added to the sense of high purpose by describing how her parents had nearly perished in the Holocaust.
Mr. Lieberman seemed comfortable sharing his religious commitment in public, invoking God about a dozen times in his speech and pointedly referring to Mr. Gore as one who had "never, never wavered in his responsibilities as a father, as a husband, and yes, as a servant of God Almighty." On a tactical level his affirmations of faith should help put the Democrats in a stronger competitive position with religious voters, but Mr. Gore and Mr. Lieberman must be careful not to let their campaign take on a theocratic tone reminiscent of the Republican alliance with the religious right.
Mr. Lieberman's presence does not, of course, guarantee Mr. Gore smooth sailing. Many liberals will not be happy with his stout defense of the insurance and pharmaceutical industries, or his support of school vouchers. Organized labor, despite the United Auto Workers' endorsement yesterday, is not happy with Mr. Lieberman's firm commitment to free trade. His legislative record will be subject to even more careful screening in the days ahead. But given his independent turn of mind and the sense of gravity and rectitude he brings to the ticket, Mr. Lieberman has gotten the attention of the Republicans and invigorated his own party as the Democrats head to their convention in Los Angeles.

HEADLINE: Brass Knuckles Over 2 Broadway;
M.T.A. and Landlord Are Fighting It Out Over Rent and Renovations

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority is on rent strike. It stopped paying rent on its office space at 2 Broadway, claiming in a lawsuit that its landlord defaulted on his promise to renovate the building.
The landlord has countersued, claiming that the price to renovate the building soared after the authority shifted some of its own responsibility to build the interior spaces onto his contractors, who are upgrading the building's infrastructure. 
 Observers say that the dispute really arose when the M.T.A.'s unrealistic expectations rubbed up against the building management's inexperience at handling commercial renovations.
It has all escalated to the point where there are now five lawsuits in New York courts, and the landlord, an immigrant from the former Soviet Union whose first job in New York was driving a cab, has been barred from setting foot in his own building.
The landlord, Tamir Sapir, has come a long way since he was cruising for fares. He told his side of the story over a nine-course meal on his 156-foot motor yacht, Mystere, which was anchored 200 yards from the dock at his 11-acre estate in Kings Point, N.Y.
The $350,000 Cartier watch on Mr. Sapir's wrist flashed as he condemned what he said was the authority's brass-knuckle negotiating over 2 Broadway, his 32-story, 1.6-million-square-foot building in Lower Manhattan, opposite Bowling Green.
Mr. Sapir contends in a lawsuit that the estimated bill for renovations has more than tripled to $156 million as the authority has inflated bills and shifted some of its own costs to his account. He charged in an affidavit that the authority refused to pay more than $10 million in rent in a ploy to force him into foreclosure so that it could buy the building at a low price.
Mr. Sapir said he had not stepped inside 2 Broadway for more than 17 months, ever since the authority, his sole tenant there, barred him from entering without its permission.
"I love that building," said Mr. Sapir, speaking in a strong Georgian accent. "But what should have cost $39 million has cost $156 million, and I can't even go in there."
At one point, Mr. Sapir said, he and his lenders were so desperate to resolve the situation that they hired Alfonse M. D'Amato, the former senator, to talk to the transportation authority to bring an end to the warfare. Nothing worked.
The authority has declined to comment on the case, citing the lawsuits. Its lawyers have complained in court about clogged pipes and backed-up toilets that Mr. Sapir was required to fix.
Privately, executives at the authority said that Mr. Sapir's building managers were incompetent. Real estate executives in the city say that although Mr. Sapir may be a shrewd buyer, he is a poor operator who has a reputation as a late payer among contractors and real estate brokers who were owed commissions on his other buildings.
Mr. Sapir (pronounced suh-PEER), 52, left the Soviet Union in 1973 with a wave of Jewish immigrants. He landed in New York in 1976, where he drove a cab for three years before borrowing $10,000 against his taxi medallion to open a small electronics store. The store, at 200 Fifth Avenue in the Flatiron neighborhood, became a wholesale outlet for Soviet diplomats, K.G.B. agents and Politburo members.
The contacts Mr. Sapir made in New York proved a boon when the Soviet Union collapsed. By the early 1990's, Mr. Sapir said, he was trading container loads of consumer electronics for multimillion-dollar oil contracts.
"He cultivated people who came to the U.S. looking for a friendly person with whom they could deal," said Peter Pettibone, who was a lawyer for the U.S.-U.S.S.R. Trade and Economic Council, which is defunct.
Mr. Sapir emerged on the New York real estate scene in 1994 with a pile of cash, eager to buy in a market devastated by a recession and corporate layoffs. He bought 2 Broadway a year later for $20.5 million. By 1999, the property was worth more than $200 million.
"The guy made some brilliant real estate investments," said Darcy Stacom, a real estate broker at Cushman & Wakefield who sold Mr. Sapir four buildings in the mid-1990's.
In the meantime, Mr. Sapir picked up the accouterments of tycoons, including a home in Kings Point, a wealthy village on the North Shore of Long Island. He has been rebuilding his 64,000-square-foot mansion for more than five years, installing a swimming pool, a squash court and a bowling alley. Italian marble adorns everything from the living room floor to the boiler room walls.
For years, Mr. Sapir said, he has been dogged by ugly rumors about the source of his wealth. "They say I'm mafia, that I'll be indicted for money laundering," he complained. "It didn't happen. Everything was done in the most legitimate way. No money laundering. No mafia."
In July 1998, the M.T.A. was in a hurry to consolidate its operations, which were scattered across two dozen buildings in Manhattan. On the day that the authority announced it was selling its office building and the Coliseum at Columbus Circle to the Related Companies and Time Warner for $345 million, it signed a 49-year lease for 2 Broadway. Mr. Sapir expected to net about $19 million a year from the lease, while the authority would be paying about $14 a square foot in annual rent, or one-third the going rate in the area.
But the authority needed 2 Broadway to be ready for occupancy within a year, a remarkably short time frame for a building that required enormous work after years of neglect, real estate executives said.
Under the agreement, Mr. Sapir would get up to $7 million in development fees and incentives to rebuild the lobby, elevators, bathrooms and heating systems, at a cost then estimated at $39 million to $55 million. If the cost exceeded that sum, the authority would lend the money at a low interest rate, and Mr. Sapir would pay it back by reducing the rent over 30 years. The authority then planned to spend an additional $328 million outfitting the interior space.
Real estate brokers and some executives at the authority said that neither Mr. Sapir nor the man who oversaw his real estate empire, Fred Contini, had any experience with major commercial renovations.
By December 1998, the authority's lawyer, John B. Wood, complained that work was proceeding slowly and filed a lawsuit claiming that the landlord had failed to get the proper insurance and performance bonds for contractors. He also objected to a short-term $86.5 million loan that Mr. Sapir took against the building from Credit Suisse First Boston, worried that if Mr. Sapir defaulted, the authority could be evicted.
Two months later, Mr. Wood abruptly chose Mr. Contini to replace Mr. Sapir as the project developer, despite the fact that Mr. Contini was already overseeing the troubled project for Mr. Sapir. In the midst of the project, Mr. Contini and Mr. Sapir had a falling out. Mr. Contini would not comment other than to say he had nothing to do with the problems between the M.T.A. and Mr. Sapir.
"Contini was in the best position to get the job done," said an authority executive who was involved in the project, "rather than bringing in a whole new guy."
At the same time, Mr. Sapir tried to place a new $230 million mortgage on 2 Broadway, money that would allow him to pay off bills and to finance renovations at three other buildings he owned.
Knowing that a landlord-tenant dispute would scare away any bank, Mr. Sapir said, Mr. Wood refused to make peace unless he agreed to a long list of concessions. So, Mr. Sapir said, he finally agreed to step aside as project developer in May 1999. But he remained responsible for the project's costs without power over how the money was spent. The transportation authority then estimated the cost of his renovations at $120 million.
From then on, "Wood and Contini controlled the whole job," said a construction executive who was involved in 2 Broadway. "When the M.T.A. took over, the costs changed. Huge upgrades went in."
But Mr. Wood continued to block the new mortgage, Mr. Sapir said. First Boston, which had been willing to lend him the money, finally quit out of frustration, according to one banker who was involved in the deal.
Mr. Sapir was finally able to get a new mortgage last September, but not before he and his lenders, CTL Capital and Capital Lease Funding, hired Mr. D'Amato to try to work out a peace treaty with the authority's chairman, E. Virgil Conway.
"We paid D'Amato $500,000," Mr. Sapir said. "He was hired to go to the M.T.A. We got the financing as soon as he was involved."
Executives at CTL Capital and Capital Lease, who spoke only on the condition of anonymity, confirmed Mr. Sapir's account.
A spokeswoman for Mr. D'Amato, Lisa DeWald, said that the former senator had represented CTL Capital and Capital Lease, not Mr. Sapir, whom, she said, Mr. D'Amato did not know. She said that Mr. D'Amato "did not act as a lobbyist," but would not discuss his duties. Mr. D'Amato is not registered with the state as a lobbyist.
Tom Kelly, a spokesman for the transportation authority, said that neither Mr. Conway nor any other official at the authority had talked to Mr. D'Amato about the problems at 2 Broadway.
Whatever happened, the detente was short-lived. In March, Mr. Sapir said, he asked the authority to hold off payment of $600,000 in bonuses to Mr. Contini for completing work on time. He said an angry Mr. Wood demanded that he withdraw the request, and when he did not, the authority refused to pay rent.
Mr. Sapir retaliated by filing a lawsuit claiming that the authority was in default on the lease, the first step toward eviction.
The authority, in turn, filed a lawsuit claiming "massive defaults" on Mr. Sapir's part and got an injunction preventing eviction. It demanded $36 million in immediate rent reductions.
Mr. Sapir, who said the legal battles were costing him $150,000 a month, then went to court demanding that the authority pay rent while the dispute was adjudicated. He said that his lenders told him that they could foreclose if he did not pay $10 million by September. In subsequent court papers, the authority played down Mr. Sapir's dire predictions and suggested that the landlord was rich enough "to write a check for $10 million tomorrow."
But Judge Rolando T. Acosta of Civil Court ruled on July 27 that the authority must pay $1.7 million a month in rent, including back rent, until the dispute is resolved in State Supreme Court. Mr. Kelly, the authority spokesman, said this ruling was being appealed.
In the meantime, the M.T.A. had lent the money for the work, now up to $156 million, at an extremely low interest rate, 1.25 percent. This was on top of its own $328 million in building improvements.
"They've gotten themselves into a deal," one real estate executive said, "where they could have built a building from the ground up cheaper than what they've spent."

Disaster Aid for Farmers

BYLINE: AP 

 BODY:
The secretary of agriculture, Dan Glickman, yesterday declared 35 of New York State's counties agricultural disaster areas because of excessive rain, flooding, high winds and hail.
The declaration, which had been sought by Gov. George E. Pataki, makes farmers in those counties eligible for emergency low-interest loans from the federal Farm Service Agency. Farmers have eight months to apply for the loans. 
 Economic losses for apple growers in the mid-Hudson Valley alone are already estimated at $10 million.
Farmers farther upstate likewise stand to lose millions of dollars because of damaged fields.

HEADLINE: Liebfraumilch, Farewell: Germany's Drinking Dry

BYLINE: By ERIC ASIMOV

DATELINE: RUDESHEIM, Germany

 BODY:
AT Georg Breuer, a leading wine estate in this small town on the Rhine, I tasted three bottles of Rudesheim Berg Schlossberg, 1998, '97 and '90 vintages. Each had aromas that were almost floral, and each was powerfully dry. The youngest was almost mouth-puckering, but with age, the wines seemed to mellow, emphasizing their extraordinary balance.
Dry is hardly the description most Americans imagine when they think of German wines. The images that arise are sugary liebfraumilch, which was once a popular beginner's wine; fruity, vibrant rieslings; and powerful trockenbeerenausleses, some of the world's grandest (and most unpronounceable) dessert wines. 
 Yet, what do the Germans themselves drink? Dry wines. Occasionally, the wines are as exquisite as the Breuers. But as I found on visits to almost two dozen wineries in the Rhine and Mosel valleys, they are more often not simply dry, but so parching that they seem to drain the mouth of every last bit of moisture. These wines are often labeled "halbtrocken" and "trocken," which translates literally as "half dry" and "dry," but more accurately as "dry" and "very dry." And now, as the German wine industry ponders how to make its product more appealing to Americans, many see dry wines as their salvation, as a way to get in step with a world that may not know a lot about white wines but wants them to be called dry.
It's not merely a debate, but an identity crisis within a wine industry in which everything seems to be open to challenge, from the tortured methods for assessing the quality of German vineyards and the Byzantine labeling laws to the recent history of German winemaking itself. And inevitably, statesmanlike solutions for improving and simplifying German wine rules fall prey to politics, which pits region against region and artisanal winemakers against industrial producers.
The economic stakes are high. Through the 1990's, the United States imported about 10 million liters of wine from Germany annually, way down from a high figure of about 60 million in 1984, according to the German Wine Information Bureau in New York. Most of that difference came from big German producers of sweet and cheap wines, whose popularity nose-dived along with that of most American jug wines in the last 15 years. But these producers want to get back into the American market, and they see dry wines as their best bet.
"They say, 'Italy had the same problem with Riunite and lambrusco, and they came out with pinot grigio,' " said Johannes Selbach, whose winery, Selbach-Oster, in Zeltingen on the Mosel River, produces both fruity and dry wines. "But we Germans should not forget that there is a strong Italian restaurant scene and market in the U.S., and they haven't had the problems with World War I and World War II. That's a strategic disadvantage for Germany that you cannot change with a change in style."
Backers of the trockens point not only to the worldwide market for dry wines, but also to their popularity in Germany, where trockens and dry Italian wines like pinot grigio are still popular.
"The 80's saw a boom in dry wines and a complete falling off of the sweet wines," Mr. Selbach said. "The trockens exploded, and drinking anything but trockens was considered politically incorrect."
Some say that the German embrace of dry wines is really a return to the way German wines were made a century ago, before technology allowed winemakers to control fermentation precisely. By this argument, today's dry wines have a greater claim to authenticity than the fruity style most people think of as traditional.
"People can misconstrue the move to a dry style as a move away from the traditional German style, but I don't think that's true," said Stephen H. Metzler of Classical Wines in Seattle, which imports Breuer and other dry rieslings into the United States.
Because of climate, soil and other conditions, some areas in Germany, like the Mosel-Saar-Ruwer, were always more suited to making fruity wines than dry wines, Mr. Metzler concedes. But he says that in areas like the Rheingau 90 to 95 percent of all wines made 100 years ago were bone dry. "This is the way wines were made until technology gave winemakers more methods of manipulation," he said.
Others regard this as historical revisionism and wishful thinking.
"The Germans were losing market share to dry Italian wines in the late 1970's and said, 'Why can't we make these wines?' " said Terry Thiese, a leading American importer of German wines. "First, they wanted to sell more wines. Then, they came up with historical, religious and health-oriented justifications."
Either way, the salient fact about the trocken wines is that most Americans are not used to wines so dry and acidic. And yet, many restaurants in Germany offer little besides trocken wines, because that is what Germans say they want.
"I refuse to believe that human beings can enjoy shrill, sour, ugly, dry wines," said Mr. Thiese, who estimates that trockens make up 20 percent of his sales in the United States. "I have to believe that the German market's embrace of these wines has nothing to do with taste and everything to do with fashion."
Supporters of the dry wines, like Armin Goring, director of the German Wine Institute, which promotes German wines at home and abroad, assert that they are better matches with food than fruity wines. Others argue for a diversity of wines, especially in a country with a wide range of cuisines like the United States.
"There's a place for trocken wines, and there's a place for fruity wines, and it depends on what comes out of the kitchen," said Rudi Wiest, another leading American importer of German wines. "I think they're illiterate when it comes to wine and food pairings over there. They don't have the plethora of styles of food that we have over here. This pushing of all dry wines, they're barking up the wrong tree. Even American wines are not bone dry."
Nor are the best dry German rieslings, which are rare because they are very hard to make.
"I defy anyone to sit with a glass of well-made trocken riesling and say anything negative, but you have to taste through hundreds of them to find anyone who knows how to do them," said Willie Gluckstern, a wine-and-food consultant, author and passionate proponent of German rieslings, dry and fruity.
The glory of German riesling rests on a teetering balance of acidity, alcohol and sweetness. When ripe grapes are picked, their juice is full of sugar. When they ferment, the sugar is converted to alcohol. If the fermentation stops before all the sugar is converted, that residual sugar will sweeten the wine, which will have less alcohol. If all the sugar is converted to alcohol, the wine will be completely dry and more powerful.
The wild card is acidity. Some residual sugar must remain to balance the tartness of riesling's naturally high acidity. Yet, if the residual sugar rises above 9 grams to a liter, by German law the wine can no longer be branded with the magic word "trocken." It must be called halbtrocken if it has up to 18 grams of residual sugar, though these wines may still taste bone dry because of their high acidity.
The tangle of German wine laws presents problems to importers, who recognize the American wine market's aversion to anything but white wines labeled dry. Mr. Gluckstern, for one, plans to bring in good-quality German wines to sell for under $10, but the trocken-halbtrocken issue is nettlesome.
"You don't have to go that dry to make a German white wine that will appeal to Americans," he said. "The problem with halbtrocken, though, is if I write 'half dry,' it's a death knell. It means it's sweet."
That's not the only issue. Almost everyone agrees that even traditional German wine terminology is now so arcane as to produce meaningless labels. Terms like "kabinett," "spatlese" and "auslese" were meant to indicate how ripe the grapes were when they were picked, and therefore to convey how sweet a wine would be. But when wines are made in a dry style, the sugar content in grapes at harvest tells little about the wine in the bottle. Similarly, terms like "trocken" and "halbtrocken" indicate how much sugar is left in the wine after it is made, but the words do not take acidity into account, again offering little clue to the wine's flavor.
"Selling beautiful German wines within their wine laws is like taking a hike through the most beautiful scenery with a 75-pound pack on your back," Mr. Thiese said. "You say, 'I wish I didn't have to carry this weight,' but you're still blown away by the beauty."
Just as some of the greatest Italian wines can be called only vino da tavola, because they do not adhere to Italian wine rules, some leading German wine producers like Georg Breuer are choosing not to play the labeling game, eliminating potentially prestigious terminology like "kabinett" and "spatlese" in favor of simple vineyard sites.
"This is the style of my wines," Bernhard Breuer said. "If we use terms like 'kabinett' and 'spatlese,' it implies that there are other sweetness levels."
Actually, Mr. Breuer does use terms like "auslese," "beerenauslese" and "eiswein" to describe his ultrasweet wines, which he makes in small quantities, but not his dry wines.
"We don't believe in trocken wines," said Mr. Breuer's importer, Mr. Metzler. "We believe in well-balanced flavorful wines. 'Trocken' has come to mean mediocre wines, in which the sweetness has been taken out, exposing its mediocrity."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Treasuries Up on Labor Data And the Sale of 5-Year Notes

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Bond prices rose yesterday after a better-than-expected government report on productivity and labor costs and a good start to the Treasury's quarterly debt sales.
The productivity report increased optimism that the Federal Reserve would leave rates alone when its policy makers meet on Aug. 22. The fresh supply of government debt kept an early cap on the day's gains, but good results helped lift prices later to session highs. The Treasury sold $10 billion of 5-year notes and plans to auction $10 billion of 10-year notes today and $5 billion of 30-year bonds tomorrow. 
 Solid auction results on the five-year maturity renewed interest in other Treasuries as investors bought the issue at a better-than-expected yield of 6.060 percent. The number of bids exceeded the size of the issue by a ratio of 3.06 to 1, the best in years, though some of that could be attributed to the reduced size of the auction.
The price of the closely watched 30-year bond rose 11/32 , to 10713/32 , while its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 5.73 percent from 5.75 percent on Monday. The 10-year note, the emerging bellwether issue, rose 8/32 , to 1047/32 . Its yield fell to 5.91 percent from 5.95 percent.
"The Labor Department's numbers couldn't have been any more friendly for bonds and stocks," said Robert Pugliese, senior vice president and director of the fixed-income department at the J. W. Genesis Financial Corporation in Boca Raton, Fla. "But that doesn't mean bond prices will rise simply because the Fed is not expected to raise rates. We are still competing with abnormal rates of return in equities."
The productivity of the nation's workers increased at an annual rate of 5.3 percent in the second quarter compared with a revised 1.9 percent in the first quarter.
The government also said unit labor costs fell 0.1 percent.
"The surge in nonfarm business productivity blew past even the most bullish forecasts on the Street," said Anthony Chan, managing director and chief economist for Banc One Investment Advisors.
"One natural question that held back some of the excitement was simply that many investors appeared to wonder what could top this economic statistical release over the near term," he said. "Given that the P.P.I. release on Friday did not appear to offer the same sort of positive surprise potential, many saw some justification for the surprising subdued response."
Mr. Chan said there was no doubt that after last week's employment report, yesterday's productivity report only had the potential to shift the Fed toward raising rates but may have had the opposite effect.
"One could argue that it calls into question whether any further action can be expected from the Fed," Mr. Chan said.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN;
Lieberman on Joining the Democratic Ticket: 'I Am Humbled and Honored'

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the announcement yesterday by Vice President Al Gore that he had named Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut as his running mate, as recorded by The New York Times. Also speaking in an appearance at a Nashville war memorial were Mr. Gore's wife, Tipper, Senator Lieberman's wife, Hadassah, and Senator Lieberman. 

Mrs. Gore
You all know what an extraordinary person Senator Joe Lieberman is, and I want you to know another very extraordinary person, a person who represents the very best of America, my friend Hadassah. Let me tell you something. . . .
We were talking last night about the fact that we graduated the same year from the same class at Boston University. I know. And I have admired her, and we have been friends for 15 years.
I want you to know something about her: her mother is a survivor of Auschwitz and Dachau. Her father was in Nazi labor camps, and organized an escape of Jewish men. And after the war was over, he helped organize and nurture Jewish orphans.
Hadassah is here. Hadassah was born to this extraordinary couple in Czechoslovakia. When she was 3 years old, her father took the family, escaped Stalin's repression and immigrated to America. To me she's not only a friend, but she represents what America is all about.

Mrs. Lieberman
We are thrilled and very, very deeply moved and honored today to be in the great State of Tennessee with our dear beloved friends, Al and Tipper. When Tipper told me that she was going to talk a bit, just mention my background today, and here I am in this place that commemorates World War II, wars of veterans, and here I am the daughter of survivors from the Holocaust, the most horrendous thing that happened, and here I am in the place that commemorates the American heroes, the soldiers who actually liberated my mother in Dachau and in Auschwitz. So I stand before you very deeply, sincerely thankful that I am an American, grateful that we have such a wonderful, wonderful family in the Gores, and that they've made this bold, wonderful choice to help us be part of the ticket that's going to win.
Let me end now with just this one statement, and I say this to all of you here and all of you who are watching this on television, and this is real: Whether you and your family immigrated from Europe, Africa, Mexico, Latin America or Asia, I am standing here for you. This person is our country. This land is your land and anything is possible for us.

Mr. Gore
With pride in his achievements, with gratitude for his acceptance of this challenge and with faith in his fight for working families, I'm here to announce my running mate, the next vice president of the United States, Senator Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut.
Tipper and I and our family, including my mother, are thrilled to welcome Joe and Hadassah and their family, including Joe's mother. And I say to all of you now, together, we're going to take this ticket from Nashville, Tenn., today to Los Angeles, Calif., next week, and then all the way across America to the White House in November.
When I set out to choose a running mate, I said from the start that I had three simple tests: First, and most importantly, I wanted someone who had the experience, the character and the judgment to become president on a moment's notice should that ever become necessary.
Second, I wanted someone who could work with me as a partner, someone who shares my values and believes in the promise of America, as I do. And third, I wanted someone who would fight, right alongside me, for the people, not the powerful. For you. Joe Lieberman has the experience and the integrity. He has the courage and the commitment. And for all his public life, Joe Lieberman has stood for working families.
He's the right person. No one is better prepared to be vice president of the United States of America. As attorney general of Connecticut, he took on the big polluters to clean up toxic waste. He believes, as I do, that every family has a right to clean air and clean water.
He believes, as I do, that the earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof.
Joe Lieberman has stood up to the big oil companies and cracked down on price gouging at the gas pumps. He believes, as I do, in an America that frees itself forever from the dominance of big oil and foreign oil.
I've known Joe Lieberman for 15 years now. We have stood together again and again for policies and principles to bring a new time of prosperity and progress.
Together we fought for welfare reform, to set time limits and make welfare a second chance and not a way of life. And the welfare rolls have been cut in half, with people moving into good jobs.
Together we fought for fiscal discipline, for balanced budgets based on hard numbers and tough choices.
And in the Gore-Lieberman administration, we will put this nation on the road to completely eliminating our national debt, to keep the prosperity and progress going.
Together we fought to make our communities safe again. We're putting 100,000 new community police on our streets, and we've seen crime rates fall seven years in a row.
In our administration, we're going to pass a crime victims' bill of rights, including a constitutional amendment to make sure that victims, and not just criminals, have guaranteed rights in our justice system.
Together we fought to provide health care for children in need and to make sure that families don't lose health insurance when a parent loses a job or changes jobs.
And in the Gore-Lieberman administration, we're going to pass a prescription drug benefit in the Medicare program for all of our seniors. And we're going to pass a real patients' bill of rights to take the medical decisions away from the accountants and give them back to the doctors and the nurses and the health care professionals.
And we're going to move step by step toward health care for all our families, starting with every child by the year 2004.
Joe Lieberman and I have fought together for campaign finance reform. And that will be the very first bill of the Gore-Lieberman administration. And together, Joe Lieberman and I have always stood for a strong national defense.
He and I broke with our own party to cast two lonely Democratic votes in support of the Persian Gulf war. . . .
Joe and I come from different regions and different religious faiths.
But we believe in a common set of ideals. And we both believe with our whole resolve, that as Americans, we must make real the great ideal that we are one country with a common destiny.
Next week, when our party meets in Los Angeles, we will recall the last time we met there, at the convention where we nominated John F. Kennedy. That year, we voted with our hearts to make history by tearing down an old wall of division.
And when we nominate Joe Lieberman for vice president, we will make history again. We will tear down an old wall of division once again.
When he sought the presidency more than 30 years ago, Robert Kennedy summoned us to make new the life of the world. That year, Robert Kennedy's Connecticut campaign chair was a young man of purpose and character, a young man who had dedicated himself to social justice and working families.
Earlier, when he was in college, that young man traveled here to the South, a year before freedom summer, when great fights for civil rights were being fought and won, to help register African-Americans to vote.
Before he went, that young man wrote these words: "I am going because there is much work to be done. I am an American, and this is one nation or it is nothing."
That young man's name was Joe Lieberman, and as I stand next to him today, I believe in my heart that we are one step closer to truly being one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
Ladies and gentlemen, the next vice president of the United States of America, Joe Lieberman.

Senator Lieberman
Thank you, Mr. Vice President, for your confidence, for your courage, for your great words. I am humbled and honored and excited to be here in Nashville today.
I am proud to stand by your side and ready to use every ounce of strength and capacity that the good Lord has given me to make you the next great president of the United States.
Dear friends, I am so full of gratitude at this moment. I ask you to allow me to let the spirit move me, as it does, to remember the words from Chronicles, which are to give thanks to God, to give thanks to God and declare his name and make his acts known to the people; to be glad of spirit; to sing to God and make music to God, and most of all, to give glory and gratitude to God from whom all blessings truly do flow.
Dear Lord, maker of all miracles, I thank you for bringing me to this extraordinary moment in my life.
And Al Gore, I thank you for making this miracle possible for me and breaking this barrier for the rest of America forever. God bless you and thank you. . . .
Now, my friends, I stand here today with a proud, simple, but I think very important message: Al Gore of Tennessee is the best man to lead America into the new century, and I know you agree with me. And America agrees with us, too. Al and I have been friends for almost 15 years now, personal friends.
And I can tell you that before the nation knew Al Gore as a vice president, I knew him as a man of family and a man of faith. There is nothing, absolutely nothing more important to Al Gore in this world than the strength of his family and the love and devotion he has for his wonderful children.
I can tell you the times, the many times, he moved meetings or rearranged his schedule to attend his children's sporting events or to be home when one of his daughters called from school. He has never, never wavered in his responsibilities as a father, as a husband and, yes, as a servant of God Almighty. Those are qualities that make him a great man and will make him the next great president of the United States of America.
Now, my friends, leadership is not just a word. It means something. It requires courage, it requires character. And I can stand here today and say to you from personal experience that Al Gore has both. He has proven time and time again by volunteering to serve his country in Vietnam, by honoring the legacy of his father with 14 remarkable years in the United State Congress, by compiling the most accomplished and successful record of leadership of any vice president in the history of this great country. That record, my friends, speak for itself.
Forty years ago, when I was 18 years old, I remember so clearly watching in awe as John F. Kennedy, the inspiration and hero of my political life, became the first Roman Catholic president of the United States. To me that election said so much to me about the courage and the character and the fairness of the American people. And I want to say to you today that choosing me as his running mate says the same thing about the courage and character and fairness of Al Gore of Tennessee.
You know, there are some people who might actually call Al's selection of me an act of chutzpah. I cannot express with words the gratitude that I feel in my heart today as the first Jewish-American to be honored to be a major party candidate for the vice presidency of this blessed United States of America.
But let's be very clear about this. It isn't me, Joe Lieberman, who deserves the credit and the congratulations for taking a bold step. It is Al Gore who broke this barrier in American history. That's right. And you know what it shows? It shows Al's faith in the tolerance of this diverse nation, in the basic fairness of the American people. And I want to say to the people of America, Al Gore trusts you, which is one good reason for you to place your trust in him as the next great president of the United States.
You know, yesterday, the day that the vice president asked me to be his running mate, was, to put it mildly, a miraculous day. Remember that old Beatles line, "a magical mystery tour"? I felt I was on a magical mystery tour yesterday. I had some just memorable conversations. And one of the most memorable of them was with the Rev. Jesse Jackson. He said something to me that went to my heart and I hope it will to yours as well. He said to me, "You know, Joe, each time a barrier falls for one person the doors of opportunity open wider for every other American."
I think we can say with certainty here in Nashville today that the American dream is alive and it is well. You might almost say that you could call this ticket the American dream team.
Now eight years ago, the American dream was not alive and well. Remember? And what strikes me as incredible is that today the same people who let this nation drift are trying to convince us that the last eight years have been squandered. Can you believe it? They must go is right. It's unbelievable. I'll tell you this, if you're one of the 22 million people in our country who got a new job during the last eight years, you know that the last eight years were not squandered.
And if you're one of the 15 million parents in our country who got time off from work to care for a child, you know that the last eight years have not been squandered. And if you are one of the millions and millions of families who were able to buy a new home because this Democratic administration turned their deficits into surpluses, you know the last eight years were not squandered. The American people know from their own lives, not from the happy talk coming out of Philadelphia a week or so ago, that these last eight years have, as the vice president has said, been years of progress and prosperity.
We still have a long way to go. And the question before us today, as we begin the drive for the White House, is this: Are we going to elect the old guard that created the problems or a new guard that will continue to work to solve America's problems and make this a better, safer, more secure country? Well, I appreciate that answer, because that's my answer to that question, too.
Al Gore -- this is no contest -- Al Gore is without a doubt the most qualified person to be president of the United States. I can tell you, for the last eight years he has served as a full partner in this administration helping to shape this country's economic policy, its social policy, its strong foreign and defense policy and it's fight for America's working middle-class families. . . .
Yes, there's a lot at stake in this election and, as I say, the real differences between the two parties. And we're going to talk about those differences from this day on. It's a choice, again, as all elections are, about whether we want to go forward or whether we want to go backward. For me, for my family, that's an easy question to answer.
And frankly, the answer comes from our history. My dad came out of high school during the Depression. He never had the chance to go to college. His first job was on a bakery truck. He'd get on it at night in New Haven, he'd ride it down to the bakery in Bridgeport, he'd work all night in the bakery and then ride the truck back as it made its stops delivering the baked goods, finally dropping him off at home, where he slept a few hours and back to work that night.
I've got to tell you that later in my life, sometimes even in political campaigns or even in my work in government, when I felt like we'd been working hard, I would think back to my dad's labor and my dad's example and the long hours he put in literally working from 9 to 9. He worked so very hard to send my two sisters and me to college, and he gave us a chance to become our hopes and our dreams. And that is what the American dream is all about.
I tell you, my friends, that somewhere in America right now, and probably many in this crowd today, there are another father or mother working just as hard to give their children a better life. And I tell you today that they deserve a leader who hears their voice, they deserve to have a government that is on their side, they deserve to have a president who will stand up for them, they deserve the leadership of Al Gore of Tennessee.

A front-page article yesterday about Vice President Al Gore's introduction of Senator Joseph I. Lieberman in Nashville as the first Jewish candidate on a major national party ticket referred incorrectly to Mr. Gore's comparison to John F. Kennedy. Kennedy was the first Catholic elected president; the first one nominated was Gov. Alfred E. Smith of New York, the Democratic candidate in 1928.

HEADLINE: Prices Starting to Stabilize For Housing in Manhattan

BYLINE: By TRACIE ROZHON

 BODY:
The fever has broken.
Manhattan's over-the-top real estate market, on a fast roll for more than four years, has lost its frenzied upward momentum and seems to be cooling down. 
 Apartment hunters, who this spring seemed caught up in a "grab it now before it's gone" panic, no longer have that desperate urge to buy, a desperation that resulted in bidding wars and angry recriminations. Within the last two months, following a rise in interest rates and a plunge in the Nasdaq, bidding wars have declined, apartments have stayed on the market longer before being sold, and hundreds have even been marked down.
Manhattan real estate prices appear to be finally leveling off.
"One of the things everyone is beginning to feel is that the market is flat," said Deborah B. Beck, executive vice president of the Real Estate Board of New York.
In another sign of a cooling off, the Real Estate Board measured a 14 percent drop in the number of Manhattan apartments sold for the quarter ended June 30, compared with the same period last year -- "a significant slowdown," Ms. Beck said. At the Corcoran Group, sealed bids, an indicator of unusual levels of competition, were down 33 percent in July compared with July 1999.
Clearly, the experts say, this is not a case of the seasonal summer blahs.
The market's softening is most evident with cookie-cutter, ordinary apartments -- notably fixer-uppers -- that had been selling for "extraordinary prices" over the last two years, said Pamela Liebman, chief executive at the Corcoran Group.
Brokers cite myriad examples, including a five-room co-op at 240 East 76th Street reduced in June to $535,000 from $615,000. A one-bedroom at 225 Central Park West near 83rd Street dropped to $305,000 from $335,000 and a studio at 82 Irving Place fell to $175,000 from $190,000. Last Thursday, a two-bedroom at 599 West End Avenue at 89th Street dropped to $349,000 from $369,000.
Even white-glove Gold Coast prewars may become a harder sell.
A five-room penthouse at 834 Fifth Avenue, at 64th Street, one of the city's top-tier co-op buildings, went on the market in April priced at $7.9 million. In late June, it was reduced to $6.49 million, and on July 31, the price dropped to $5.8 million.
"The edge is off the market," said Jonathan Miller, president of Miller Samuel, the appraisal firm that compiles statistics for Douglas Elliman, the city's biggest brokerage firm. Especially during the last month, Mr. Miller said, "we're seeing much more modest appreciation, more of a return to normalcy."
The experts link the slowdown to the Nasdaq plunge that began on April 14, and to the Federal Reserve's half-point interest rate increase in May, "the one that really had the impact," said Marilyn Harra Kaye, president of Prudential/ MLBKaye Realty. "Buyers wonder if they'll get a better deal if they wait," she said. "If they buy now, they worry that the higher cost of mortgages will drive prices down and lower their investment."
The changing statistics mirror a national trend, but there is nothing to indicate the start of a slump like the one in the late 1980's and early 90's. Real estate experts noted that prices remain high -- the average apartment price for the period April through June was a record $854,704 in Manhattan south of 116th Street on the West Side and south of 96th Street on the East. But that figure represents contracts signed an average of two months before -- in the white-hot months of February, March and April. Based on contracts signed in July, Mr. Miller projected a price rise of only 1 percent, to $864,000. (The average price recorded in 1995 was $414,187.)
While none of the experts were willing to predict where the Manhattan market would be by the end of the year, no one labeled the cooling temporary. One thing seems certain: One of the biggest sellers' markets in New York history has fractionally tilted more toward the buyer -- and the buyers are noticing.
For the first time in his two years of looking, Tom Pappas, a Midtown lawyer, has spotted the same properties showing up week after week on his Internet searches. But he is not biting until their prices go down. Then, he vowed, "I'll be there."
Buck Morillas, who sold his house in East Hampton, N.Y., and is prowling for a great $800,000 loft in the Flatiron district, says he thinks he is getting close.
"Six months ago, the agents were saying, 'This place is going to fly tonight, so you better make an offer,' " he said. "Now the agents are whispering, 'This place is very negotiable.' "
For their part, brokers insist that no one is grasping at lowball offers, but they concede that now, more sellers are accepting modest reductions off the asking price.
In interviews, agents said that today's buyers were more cautious and that they spent more time looking, but that many did, in the end, buy -- and at a good price.
They reject comparisons to the late 1980's, after the October 1987 stock market debacle, when the real estate market dipped -- albeit very slowly -- into the real estate recession of the early 1990's. For one thing, they say, that was the time of a glut of new, sometimes poorly built condominiums; this time, developers built stronger, more lavishly detailed family apartments and lofts, which are still bringing record prices. And those types of luxury apartments, brokers add, are still in short supply.
Nevertheless, Ms. Kaye of Prudential/MLBKaye Realty, in a report to be released this week, found 373 price decreases in June (out of 542 changes in price), compared with 189 in February (out of 504 changes), in a market of 15,000 listings, a shift in balance she called significant.
Brokers explain that many of these price decreases -- especially those in the multimillion-dollar category -- were the result of overpricing. The Fifth Avenue penthouse "ended up being overpriced," said Hall Willkie, head of residential sales at Brown Harris Stevens, the Upper East Side firm with the listing. "We were testing the market," he said. "We were aggressive, and we had to reduce the price."
Part of the problem for brokers is that sellers do not realize that the market is in transition, said Ed Ferris, a broker with William B. May Real Estate. Many sellers expect more money than their neighbors got only a few months ago. But brokers say that kind of escalation is no longer happening.
"The days when everything was being priced six weeks ahead are over," said Frederick W. Peters, president of Ashforth Warburg Real Estate in Manhattan, referring to the strategy of setting a price based on where a property might sell in the future. "That strategy is not working anymore. The market ain't catching up. Properties priced like that are being reduced."
In the report Mr. Miller just finished for Douglas Elliman, he found that properties spent an average of 28 percent more time on the market than they did during the same period a year ago, 118 days versus 92 days.
These changes reflect a national trend. Fred Flick, the vice president for research at the National Association of Realtors, said the real estate market nationally was down 6 percent in volume; the association estimates that volume will be down 9 percent by the end of the year. And while it still predicts average price increases at 2 percent to 3 percent this year, that is less than last year's 4 percent.
"We've slowed from a blistering pace to a simmering pace," Mr. Flick said.
The national slowdown was confirmed on Thursday, when the Commerce Department reported that across the country, new-home sales fell 3.7 percent in June to the lowest level in two and a half years. Median prices fell slightly.
"Clearly, home sales -- both new and existing -- have passed their peak," said Lyle Gramley, a consulting economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association.
Although the slowdown started hitting the hottest of the country's markets -- cities like San Francisco, Houston and Atlanta -- in late April (the Nasdaq plunge) and in May (the Fed's half-point jump), the market in the Hamptons, out on the sunny, wind-swept tip of Long Island, seemed immune to the trauma.
But not anymore.
"Right now there's a certain hesitancy," said Frank Newbold, manager of Sotheby International Realty's office in East Hampton. As in Manhattan, the truly premier properties in the Hamptons are still selling close to asking price or above, he said. "The second-tier properties sit on the shelf a bit," he added. Now, there are "fewer deals, for bigger prices."
"Last summer, we were rocking along at full pitch, with no looking back," Mr. Newbold said. As recently as the beginning of July, "it was top down on the convertible and everybody wanted a piece of the rock out here."
But now, the urgency is gone. "Now there's a bit of caution," he said, "like they don't want to be the last fool: the last person to pay the highest price."

HEADLINE: Newark Gives Travel Agents a Peek at the Future of Tourism

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS 

DATELINE: NEWARK, Aug. 8

 BODY:
This is not a place that immediately leaps to mind when people think of tourism destinations.
But when 40 travel agents showed up here tonight for the beginning of a two-day tour of Newark's neighborhoods, parks and partly revitalized downtown, they got an intriguing glimpse of something that probably could not have happened at another time in the last four decades: the selling of Newark. 
 The gathering, known in the tourism business as "a mystery tour" in which the visiting agents are given only a general idea of what they will be seeing, is the first time in the memory of city officials and local tourism experts that the city has so aggressively sought its share of an estimated $7.5 billion annual tourist market in northern New Jersey.
It was an effort that would not have been possible until now in a city whose image has long been defined by the devastating riots of 1967.
Indeed, along with a recent advertising campaign organized by a consortium of business and civic groups to promote the city to corporations looking for office space, the tour was part of Newark's efforts to capitalize on a thriving economy and a pervasive sense of opportunity.
"The idea that we are the capital of bad inner cities is gone," said Councilwoman Gayle Chaneyfield-Jenkins, a member of the City Council's newly energized tourism committee, which is co-sponsoring the tour with the Gateway Tourism Council and the New Jersey chapter of the American Society of Travel Agents.
"The view here is that we are one of the great cities -- not the prettiest, because we have our warts, but not the ugliest either," she said. "It's like a house that is being remodeled but isn't quite there. But it's good enough to invite guests in."
Mark Shapiro, the president of the New Jersey chapter of the travel agents group, said that at first the idea of Newark was "a tough sell" to a busload of savvy travel agents.
"Their first reaction," he said, "was 'Are you out of your mind?' But now they are very excited."
Today's tour comes on the heels of the advertising campaign unveiled this summer by corporate leaders. It began with a six-week print campaign featuring full-page testimonials from new and longtime business leaders in the city telling of advantages like the transportation network, nearby airport, fiber optics infrastructure and office rents that are a fraction of the Manhattan rents just a 15-minute train ride away.
Dan Gales, executive director of Connection-Newark, the private economic development group that helped organize the campaign, said that the goal was to demonstrate that changes in Newark were real and not just public relations hype.
To that end, the campaign stresses things that are already completed in the city and plays down such things as a proposed downtown sports arena for the New Jersey Nets and New Jersey Devils, the construction that just began on the regional headquarters of the credit-card giant M.B.N.A., and the newly opened Starbucks.
"We are trying to demonstrate that Newark is more than just the promise of future activity or things that we think will happen," said William Freeman, the president for public communications of Verizon and one of the business leaders behind the ad campaign. "We want to show businesses and others thinking about locating here that they aren't pioneers and that the pioneering has already been done."
The group is still assessing the impact of the print ad campaign, which ended in late June, as it prepares to run a similar ad campaign on television. A Web site set up for businesses interested in Newark received 30,000 to 40,000 hits a week during the campaign, which ran from May 28 to July 5. It featured ads in The Star Ledger, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and local ethnic papers. Before the ads ran, the site received about 5,000 hits a week.
As they began their tour this evening at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, many of the travel agents did sound a bit like wary pioneers while others with memories of a long-ago Newark were just glad that someone was giving them a reason to think about returning.
"I live an hour away but never came to Newark because, frankly, there wasn't much reason," said Ralph Ferrara of Schneider Travel Service in Butler, N.J. "I'm very anxious now to see why I should come here."
After a reception tonight at the Newark Museum, the tour will take many of the travel agents tomorrow to Branch Brook Park, a sprawling area designed by Frederick Law Olmstead that has more cherry blossoms than Washington's Tidal Basin. They will visit the Basilica of the Sacred Heart, rebuilt residential areas like Society Hill in the Central Ward where the 1967 riots began, and stalwart older communities like Forest Heights with its hardy Victorian houses. They will visit the home of the New Jersey Historical Society and tour the minor-league baseball park Riverfront Stadium and one of the newly renovated downtown office buildings that is attracting lawyers and high-tech businesses.
For Claudette Jones of Voyager Travel in Trenton, the tour was "a great, great opportunity" to sample the improvements in the city that she has heard about. For Salvatore Castoria, of A Better Trip in Matawan, N.J., the "bad outweighed the good in Newark" for a long time, but the tour gave him a chance to learn a lot of positive things about the city.
"You're not going to go here instead of Miami Beach," Aland Landesman said, "but for a day or two while visiting the region it's fine."
Richard Copland, the incoming president of the American Society of Travel Agents, who runs Hillside Travel in the Bronx, was impressed mostly by the $187 million New Jersey Performing Arts Center, which he said was among the attractions that could help Newark attract some of the "spillover" tourism from New York, which is bursting at the seams with tourists.
"There's a lot of money out there now, and people who travel want options like a baseball game, entertainment, restaurants," Mr. Copland said. "Five years ago you wouldn't come here and would be talking instead about the poverty and drug addiction of Newark. But that has changed, and I'm impressed."
But some Newark travel agents, like Lorraine Lavender of Grand Travel Inc., were less convinced of the city's appeal. Many of the amenities that tourists seek were not here in abundance, she said, adding that greater economic development and the influx of more businesses was necessary before the city could be a true tourist destination.
"When 6 o'clock comes, they are like cattle leaving," she said, referring to people who work in many of the city's office buildings.
But Kevin Jenkins, the husband of Councilwoman Chaneyfield-Jenkins, said there was ample recent history of urban turnarounds to give him confidence that Newark's efforts to sell itself to business as well as tourism had a shot at success.
"They said it was wishful thinking in Cleveland, in Baltimore and Boston," he said. "Look at those places. Who's dreaming?"

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE RECORD;
An Ally of Big Business Balances a Friend of the Earth

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 8

 BODY:
At a Democratic fund-raiser last month at the Upper West Side duplex apartment of the singer Paul Simon, Vice President Al Gore was introduced by Connecticut's senators, Christopher J. Dodd and Joseph I. Lieberman.
After some preliminary remarks about the strength of the economy and the old ideas of Republicans, Mr. Gore began to bash big oil and big insurance companies, a staple nowadays of his stump speech. 
 "We need to give the medical decisions back to the doctors, and take them away from the accountants and the H.M.O.'s and the insurance companies," he declared.
The moment Mr. Gore uttered the words "insurance companies," several of the people in Mr. Simon's living room snickered loudly. Insurance is to Connecticut what oil is to Oklahoma, what automobiles are to Michigan, what tobacco is to Kentucky. And Mr. Lieberman has been a staunch ally of the industry.
Indeed, on a broad array of issues, Mr. Lieberman is perceived as a business-friendly Democrat. On some issues, including those that affect the insurance industry, he has been much more of a business ally than Mr. Gore. This could help the Democratic ticket in its fund-raising and in reassuring corporate leaders who are nervous about Mr. Gore's environmental views.
For example, Mr. Lieberman is one of a handful of Democrats who support legislation to limit the amount of damages that can be collected from lawsuits. Such legislation has been at the top of corporate America's Washington wish list for more than a decade. Insurance companies have led the battle in favor it. Trial lawyers, among the Democratic Party's biggest contributors, have led the fight against the limits on damages. Mr. Lieberman has always been on the side of the insurance business. Mr. Gore has always been with the lawyers.
"We consider Mr. Lieberman a friend of the insurance industry," said Jack Dolan, a spokesman for the American Council of Life Insurance.
By the same token, Mr. Lieberman has regularly voted for increases in the Pentagon's budget. Two major defense contractors, the General Dynamics Corporation and the United Technologies Corporation, have plants in Connecticut that employ thousands of workers.
Mr. Lieberman has been an ally of other companies that Mr. Gore has blasted in recent speeches, including pharmaceutical companies. Several, including the Bayer Corporation, the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company and Pfizer Inc., have operations in Connecticut. In 1997, when the Senate was considering legislation to reauthorize the Food and Drug Administration, Mr. Lieberman was among the few Democrats who voted on the side of the drug industry on important amendments.
Mr. Lieberman has been rewarded for this support with campaign donations. The Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan organization that tracks campaign money, reported today that Mr. Lieberman had received more money from the insurance interests for his Senate race this year than any other senator ($197,419), and more from pharmaceutical interests ($91,150) than any other senator except Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, who is chairman of the Finance Committee's subcommittee on health. Mr. Lieberman has also received nearly $100,000 from political action committees and individuals connected to defense contractors.
It is not surprising that Mr. Lieberman has been a standard bearer for important industries in his state. A politician who did not do that would not last very long in office.
But as Democrats go, Mr. Lieberman has been quite friendly to business generally, something that could reassure corporate interests that have been tepid about Mr. Gore. Frank Coleman, a spokesman for the United States Chamber of Commerce, said that in his two terms in the Senate, Mr. Lieberman had voted on the side of business interests more than almost any other Democrat.
Mr. Lieberman is a vigorous supporter of international trade, a position similar to Mr. Gore's but different from many Democrats, and he is one of the few Democrats in the Senate who favors a reduction in the capital gains tax.
In Silicon Valley, Mr. Lieberman is hailed as the senator who saved stock options.
In 1994, accounting rulemakers considered changing the accounting procedures for stock options in a way that would have reduced the reported profits of companies that granted options to executives and other employees. It was one of the first Congressional issues to attract lobbying from executives in Silicon Valley.
First, Mr. Lieberman pushed through the Senate a nonbinding resolution that denounced the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the arbiter of accounting procedures, for trying to change the rules. Then he introduced legislation to restrict the authority of the board. After that, the board backed down.
In part for his role in the options fight, the American Electronic Association, a trade group of technology companies, named Mr. Lieberman to the "high-tech legislative hall of fame." Mr. Gore considers the high-tech community an important constituency and has held many fund-raising events and meetings with its executives.
Mr. Lieberman's record in support of business interests could help Democratic fund-raising for the fall campaign.
"Senator Lieberman's record on fiscal responsibility and issues with regard to business generally has been very strong, very moderate and ought to be very attractive to the business community," said Joel Jankowsky, who heads the lobbying arm of Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld, a Washington law firm.
There is a business constituency that remains nervous about Mr. Lieberman: Hollywood. Entertainment executives, one of the Democratic Party's most important cash constituencies, are nervous about his embrace of the V-chip and his alliance with William J. Bennett, the former education secretary under President Ronald Reagan, in denouncing excessive violence and sex in movies, television and music. But that will not stop entertainment executives from organizing lavish parties for the Democratic ticket next week at the Democratic convention in Los Angeles.

HEADLINE: No Lectures or Teachers, Just Software

BYLINE: By JOSHUA GREEN

 BODY:
THE red phone on your desk rings in the middle of the night. The voice you hear is that of the White House chief of staff, alerting you to a crisis in the Eastern European country of Krasnovia. You're needed at the White House, pronto. "We'll send a limo," he says, and hangs up. After an emergency meeting with the president, you're given a classified intelligence report and access to the country's foremost diplomats, policy analysts and military leaders. You are to submit a report in time for a presidential address that evening. The president is waiting to act on your recommendation.
This is high school, circa 2010. 
 The scene is from an interactive software course, Crisis in Krasnovia, that its creator, Roger C. Schank, believes will revolutionize how children are taught.
"Software is going to replace classes as we know them," said Dr. Schank, director of the Institute for Learning Sciences at Northwestern University. After a career studying artificial intelligence at Stanford and Yale, Dr. Schank has shifted his sights from teaching computers to teaching students. In 1995, he founded Cognitive Arts, a company that is exploring commercial uses of software-based teaching.
A critic of traditional teaching methods, Dr. Schank wants to use technology to overhaul the entire educational system. "The computer is our Trojan mouse," he said. "It allows us to get our foot in the door to do something radical and difficult."
Through the Institute for Learning Sciences and Cognitive Arts, Dr. Schank and his staff have developed more than 100 programs, many of them, like Krasnovia, purely for learning research. But the company has also created courses for clients like Arthur Andersen, the Environmental Protection Agency and the United States Air Force.
Dr. Schank is marketing his courses to universities and believes they will be attracted by the potential savings and by the program's academic pedigree. In May, Cognitive Arts announced it would join with Columbia University to develop 80 software-based courses that correspond directly to existing Columbia courses. In June, Harvard Business School said it would begin offering pre-enrollment software courses designed by Cognitive Arts to students who had been accepted for enrollment.
Dr. Schank's programs combine the look of high-tech video games with a Mission Impossible-style narrative. A course in biology, for instance, might challenge students to stop a worldwide virus outbreak; an economics course might have them play the role of adviser to the chairman of the Federal Reserve; a physics course might entail building a rocket and landing it on the moon. In essence, each software course is like an elaborate choose-your-own-ending novel.
The aim is to get students to delve into a course's volumes of academic information, including hours of videotape of experts in a field related to the program. Students running Krasnovia, for example, can draw on video advice from Thomas Boyatt, a former ambassador, and Bruce Laingen, an American diplomat who was held hostage in Iran and is president of the American Academy of Diplomacy.
Rather than subject students to full-blown lectures, Dr. Schank breaks the video into snippets that address only the question at hand. He believes students learn more effectively through this piecemeal approach, which he calls "just in time" learning.
"The value of the computer is that it allows kids to learn by doing," he said. "People don't learn by being talked at. They learn when they attempt to do something and fail. Learning happens when they try to figure out why."
Bald, bearded and powerfully built, Dr. Schank's appearance and demeanor suggest Marlon Brando in the movie "Apocalypse Now." His professional reputation is somewhat similar. His brusque manner and outspoken criticism of those he disagrees with have alienated some colleagues and earned him the reputation of iconoclast. But his success in designing teaching software has made him a much sought after figure among businesses, military clients and universities.
His company puts extraordinary effort into creating software courses, each of which can take up to a year to design and can cost up to $1 million. Video is an important component of Dr. Schank's program. After interviewing professors, his staff develops a story, writes a script, hires professional actors and begins filming. Cognitive Arts even arranged the use of CNN footage of the Bosnian conflict to lend the aura of authenticity to Crisis in Krasnovia.
The programs allow students to progress at their own pace. Dr. Schank says the semester system is badly outdated, a view he also holds for most tests, which foster only temporary memorization, he says. His programs require students to write detailed reports on what they have learned. A student who cuts corners does not finish the course, and the failing grade is delivered in the spirit of a video game. In Krasnovia, for instance, an incomplete report would draw a mock newscast in which commentators ridicule the president's address. Students must then go back and improve their work.
These multimedia simulations differ radically from current online offerings. "When you look at online courses now, what do you see?" Dr. Schank said. "Text online with a quiz. We're not taking a lecture and putting it on screen. We're restructuring these courses into goal-based scenarios that will get kids excited."
Dr. Schank says that such courses will render traditional classes -- and many professors -- obsolete. "The idea of one professor for one class is ancient," he said. "New technology is going to give every student access to the best professors in the world."
But many academics dismiss Dr. Schank's prediction that traditional teaching methods will soon become obsolete and question software learning's pedagogic value. "Education depends on relationships between people," said David F. Noble, a history professor at York University in Toronto and a critic of online learning. "Interactive is not the same as interpersonal. What Schank doesn't recognize is that teaching is not just about relaying knowledge."
Others warn against accepting radical new technology without pause. "The American university system is a highly functional institution," said Phil Agre, an associate professor of information studies at the University of California at Los Angeles. "The danger is that we will apply overly simplistic ideas about technology and tear apart the institution before we really know what we're doing."
Another assessment of the value of Dr. Schank's work is offered by Prof. Howard Nusbaum, chairman of the psychology department at the University of Chicago. "Schank's idea in principal is a very sound one," Professor Nusbaum said. "But in the case of software learning, its success or failure will depend on implementation more than theory."
Several of the country's top universities are experimenting with ways to implement new technology-based teaching methods. Seymour Papert, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Media Laboratory, was among the first to advocate computers as teaching tools.
"The world is changing so fast that the concept of schools teaching people what they need to know is no longer viable," Dr. Papert said. "We're moving into a time when people need to know how to learn things they weren't taught in school. Second, we now have the technology to let kids learn better. This will not just allow them to learn the same things better; it will teach kids to learn radical new things at all ages."
Mitchel Resnick, another professor at M.I.T.'s Media Laboratory, said: "Computers offer kids multiple ways to learn, where in the past there was only one way. Ultimately, you want kids to have a tool chest of different options they can bring to bear when solving problems."
But new technology also threatens to exacerbate current inequities. Dr. Resnick worries that the so-called digital divide will not be one of access to computers but a "fluency gap" between those able to use them for learning and those who merely use them to play games.
Dr. Schank does not think his programs will be a victim of the digital divide. He believes that poorer schools are likely to benefit first from his programs. Top high schools "don't want this -- their kids get into Harvard," he said.
"But poorer schools," he continued, "aren't going to turn down a college level software course that's endorsed by Columbia."
Dr. Schank pointed to the example of the Daniel Jenkins Academy, a public high school in Polk County, Fla., a poor district that will switch to online teaching this fall. Students will gather in classrooms where they will take Web-based classes on computers. They will be taught remotely by teachers working from their homes. Dr. Schank suggested that once disadvantaged students began outperforming those from better schools, many long-held assumptions about teaching will go the way of the slide rule.
"We have a whole country of people who agree on education, and they're all wrong," he said with characteristic bluntness. "School just isn't that relevant anymore. We'll make it relevant. We're trying to overthrow the system."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: COMMODITIES;
Crude Oil Prices Rise Sharply After a Report on Inventories

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Crude oil prices surged past $30 a barrel yesterday after an industry report showed that United States inventories were at their lowest levels since 1976.
The report, released after the market closed on Tuesday, heightened concerns about potential supply shortages later this year. Oil inventory levels remain low even though OPEC has increased output twice this year. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has increased production by more than two million barrels a day, or 2.7 percent of worldwide output. 
 "The decline in distillate is very scary because this is when you build inventory for winter," said Bill O'Grady, director of fundamental futures research at A. G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis. "If you don't get caught up by the middle of September, you usually don't get caught up."
Crude oil for September delivery rose $1.23, or 4.2 percent, to $30.35 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It was the highest closing price since July 20. Oil prices are up 43 percent from a year ago.
The American Petroleum Institute reported that supplies dropped 2.1 million barrels, to 282.6 million, as a 17 percent rise in imports could not offset near-record demand from refiners. Distillate fuel inventories also fell, with heating oil supplies now 39 percent below levels a year ago.
The Energy Department released its own inventory estimates yesterday, pegging United States crude oil supplies slightly higher, up 1.3 million barrels, to 285.4 million.
"The D.O.E.'s are probably a little more realistic, but still not very comforting," Mr. O'Grady said of the figures.
Most analysts had expected crude oil inventories to rebound, after dropping nine million barrels in the previous week.
In London, Brent crude oil for September settlement rose 97 cents, or 3.4 percent, to $29.87 a barrel on the International Petroleum Exchange. Prices are up 46 percent from a year ago.
"The A.P.I. numbers have pulled the market up," said Simon Stanley, a trader with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in London. "But I don't think they were bullish enough to justify this sort of increase."
In other energy trading in New York, heating oil for September delivery rose 3.71 cents, or 4.7 percent, to 83.54 cents a gallon. Prices are 51 percent higher than a year ago, though well below a nine-year high of $1 reached on Jan. 31.

HEADLINE: Fewer Inflation Alarms in New Fed Survey

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 9

 BODY:
The economy has slowed, dampening demand and keeping consumer prices in check, the Federal Reserve said today in its latest regional economic survey.
"Easing demand appears to be restraining price increases," said the Fed report, commonly known as the beige book. "District reports suggest consumer spending, manufacturing and construction were slightly softer than in the last report." 
 While labor markets "continue to be very tight" and energy costs have risen, retailers and other businesses are not passing along those costs to consumers in the form of higher prices, "partly because of competitive pressures," the Fed said.
The report suggests that the central bank's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee will not need to raise interest rates to slow the economy at its next meeting, on Aug. 22. The Fed has raised the overnight bank lending rate to 6.5 percent, a nine-year high, in six steps since June 1999.
The report is far less alarmist than previous regional reports, and it will form the basis of the committee's discussion about the state of the economy. The report noted slowdowns or stable growth in virtually every major sector of the economy, including the consumer sector.
The Fed did note that businesses were having difficulty finding workers, with "severe" shortages in the Boston and Kansas City districts. The problem of finding workers was keeping some companies from growing in the districts around Atlanta, Dallas, St. Louis and Richmond, Va.
"A staffing service contact in the Chicago area said that meeting its customers' needs for workers was 'like torture,' " the Fed report said. Fast-food chains in St. Louis are offering their employees free meals, regular pay increases and profit sharing, the Fed said.
The lack of available workers has been a Fed concern for more than a year. Previous Fed surveys on the economy have noted that wages were rising, although with no clear effect on consumer prices.
In the Fed's view, the job market picture appears to be improving. The pool of available workers, after falling steadily since 1996, has stabilized in the last seven months, hovering between 9.8 million and 10.3 million. And the Labor Department said last week that the unemployment rate stayed at 4 percent in July as the economy lost 108,000 jobs.

I.M.F. Expects Investments in Emerging Countries to Decline

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 9

 BODY:
Private investment in Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe will drop during the next year as investors seek safe havens because of concern the United States economy and stock market will slump, the International Monetary Fund predicted in a report released today.
"The tight link between the performance of emerging and U.S. asset markets has tempered our optimistic outlook for emerging markets financing," the fund said in its first quarterly report on investments in emerging markets. "We expect overall financing flows to moderate in coming quarters." 
 A decline of almost 30 percent in the Nasdaq composite index from March through May prompted investors to pull out of stock and bond markets in economies from South Africa and Russia to Argentina and Indonesia.
That pullout forced developing nations to cut back on the sale of new bonds. Total new bond sales totaled $15.5 billion in April through June -- less than half that issued the previous three months and "comparable to the crisis quarters of 1997," the fund said.
"Only those that really needed to raise money did so, often damaging returns," the report said. Argentina topped that list, selling $2.6 billion in new bonds.
As concern about United States interest rate increases eased in June, equity markets in countries like Argentina and Indonesia and bonds in Turkey and Russia rebounded, the fund's report said.
"A decisive decoupling of emerging from U.S. markets is unlikely," the report said. It predicted that more investors were likely to keep their money in safe markets or in cash, particularly if an expected slowdown in the American economy becomes a so-called hard landing.
As a result of the United States slowdown, investors are shunning developing economies, even though growth in the countries where those markets are based is largely improving, the fund report said.
The poor performance of those markets "was due to the external environment," the report concluded. And that environment was set by markets in richer nations, it said.
Companies eager to issue new equity or countries seeking to sell new bonds, it said, will have to endure "choppy conditions and exploit windows of opportunity."
In the last quarter, the $5.7 billion initial public offering of China Unicom accounted for more than half the total $11.1 billion new equity issues from emerging markets.
The fund also found that investors were changing their analyses of these more risky equity markets, as they begin to invest based on specific industries, not just overall political considerations
. The fund did not forecast how much investment in emerging markets would drop in the next year.

HEADLINE: Gordon Spivack, 71, Antitrust Lawyer and Ex-Justice Official

BYLINE: By SETH SCHIESEL 

 BODY:
Gordon B. Spivack, a prominent antitrust lawyer and former senior Justice Department official, died at his home in New Haven on Sunday. He was 71.
The cause was colon cancer, said Stephen M. Hudspeth, head of the litigation department at Coudert Brothers, the New York City law firm where Mr. Spivack was a senior partner from 1986 until his death. 
 As a lawyer for Coudert and earlier for the firm of Lord, Day & Lord, now defunct, Mr. Spivack's roster of clients included some of the nation's biggest companies, including Cargill, Chevron and Union Carbide. He also represented the Coca-Cola Company for decades, defending the company's often-challenged relationship with bottlers and distributors, and spent much of the 1980's successfully defending Fischbach & Moore, a big electrical contractor, against bid-rigging charges.
Mr. Spivack's move from Lord, Day to Coudert in 1986 played a small but influential role in the evolution of New York's legal profession from a clubby business ruled by tradition into a more open industry. As a government lawyer in the 1950's and 1960's, Mr. Spivack won cases that brought fines and jail time to executives at large corporations including General Electric and Westinghouse.
Born in New Haven, Mr. Spivack graduated from Yale in 1950. After graduation he joined the United States Army, becoming a sergeant first class in the Army's medical corps. Mr. Spivack returned to New Haven in 1952 to enroll in Yale Law School, from which he graduated first in the class of 1955.
That year, when Herbert Brownell Jr. was attorney general, Mr. Spivack joined the Justice Department's antitrust division. Mr. Spivack was the government's lead lawyer when it sued executives at G.E. and Westinghouse in 1960, accusing them of fixing the price of large electrical generators.
In 1965, Mr. Spivack became the department's director of operations, supervising 350 trial lawyers. But in 1967 he returned to Yale Law School as a professor of antitrust law and civil procedure.
"Antitrust was his lifeblood," said Mr. Hudspeth, who was a student of Mr. Spivack. "He lived the antitrust law and believed it was a cornerstone of our democratic polity and of our economic freedom."
In 1970, Mr. Brownell was a partner at Lord, Day and that year he lured Mr. Spivack out of academia to start Lord, Day's antitrust group (though Mr. Spivack taught at Yale at night until 1978). He remained there for more than 15 years, while serving on the President's Commission for Revision of Antitrust Law and Procedures in the late 1970's.
But in 1986, Mr. Spivack took himself, 17 other lawyers and all of his clients to Coudert.
Tellingly, perhaps, Mr. Spivack changed firms because he wanted seven of his associates made into partners and Lord, Day agreed to promote only two.
"To me it's insane to tell people who are highly qualified, 'Go find some other firm because we got some fixed ratio between partners and associates,' " Mr. Spivack said at the time. "I thought I did owe it to these people. Since my own firm did not recognize this, I went looking for someone who did."
At that time, the Spivack defection was perhaps the biggest ever from a major Manhattan law firm, and it helped usher in an era in which much of New York's legal community turned its back on many traditional ways of doing business. Lord, Day itself could not make the transition and closed its doors in 1994.
Mr. Spivack is survived by his wife, Dolores T., of New Haven; a brother, Irving, of Woodbridge, Conn.; two sons, Michael D., of Miami, and Paul S., of New York; and two grandchildren.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
An investment bank drops the traditional.

BYLINE: By Bernard Stamler 

 BODY:
THEY don't sell consumer goods. Although they are financial institutions, they don't have street-level branches, tellers or A.T.M.'s. Many people have no idea what they do, and few people will ever interact directly with one.
So just how do you advertise an investment bank? 
 Traditionally, the answer was simple: with "tombstones," the somber boxes in the financial press that announce this big deal or that, complete or in the works. But that was before the Internet economy and its lucrative initial public offerings changed everything, inspiring heightened competition among the players in a once buttoned-down industry. Nowadays, extensive display and broadcast ad campaigns have become the norm.
The latest to join the fray: Robertson Stephens, the San Francisco-based investment banking arm of the FleetBoston Financial Corporation. In an industry dominated by old-line giants like Goldman, Sachs & Company, it is determined to make its mark. Or, at the very least, to carve out its niche.
The company was founded in 1978, not far from Silicon Valley and at about the same time that the high-technology industry there began to blossom. (It was acquired by FleetBoston's predecessor, the BankBoston Corporation, in 1998.) Lately, its revenues have risen sharply, from $360 million in 1998 to $970 million last year to "nearly a billion" so far this year, according to Allen Olivo, its chief marketing officer. Because Robertson Stephens has specialized for years in bringing technology companies to market, with clients like the E*Trade Group, the online investment firm, it is, he said, "the first investment bank to focus on the new economy."
But how can that translate into an advantage over bigger Wall Street-based Johnny-come-latelies? The idea is to build brand, said Mr. Olivo, who has been involved in branding before with companies like Amazon .com and Apple Computer, where he was senior director for marketing communications during the "Think Different" days of the late 1990's. Robertson Stephens was in Silicon Valley, literally and figuratively, before anyone else, he said, and because of that has "knowledge that gives us a unique perspective in a global growth economy."
Hence an unconventional new campaign devised by Wieden & Kennedy in Portland, Ore., that breaks today in The New York Times and other newspapers. "Thanks, old economy," proclaim the double-page spreads, words floating on an otherwise blank background. "We'll take it from here."
The ad is intended to "say something, but quietly," said the account director, Trish Adams, and to stress that Robertson Stephens's "culture is a little different from other investment banks." Future print ads, also featuring one-line statements will follow, she said, in publications like The Wall Street Journal, Industry Standard and Fast Company. And, like today's example, they will feature one-line statements -- "headlines," Ms. Adams called them -- that will be more like philosophical statements than hard-sell slogans.
The 30-second Robertson Stephens television spots -- all of them apparently filmed in double or triple time -- also aim to be unconventional in their message, she said, without delving too far into the substance of what, exactly, an investment bank does. In one of them, for example, an off-camera announcer muses about America's westward migration and the fact that there is "still so much more to be done." "It's not time to settle down," he intones as a freighter scoots by the Golden Gate Bridge, waves lapping nearby and San Francisco's skyline barely visible in the distance. "It never is."
In another spot, the same voice asks if "you really think that all the technology in the world can erase economic truths that have held for hundreds of years?" And as clouds speed over the tops of buildings in San Francisco's financial district, shot from a camera looking up at times at nearly a 90-degree angle, he answers the question himself: "So do we. Ladies and gentlemen, this time it's different."
The commercials will run primarily on Bloomberg television, CNBC and CNNfn, Ms. Adams said, beginning this week and continuing through at least the end of the year. And the lack of substance in them and in print is deliberate, she said; for now, the idea is to say "who they are and what they stand for," with respect to Robertson Stephens. Advertising with "more content will be rotated in later," Ms. Adams said.
Neither she nor Mr. Olivo would disclose the size of the Robertson Stephens effort, although the trade press put the figure at $25 million when Wieden & Kennedy was awarded the account back in May. And while Mr. Olivo hopes that the campaign will result in increased business for the firm, that will be only one of the benchmarks by which its success will be gauged, he said. There are other more intangible measures as well.
"Our target is multifaceted," he said, involving, among other things, "recruiting, as we grow in size, and geographically," as well as "getting better known by the public" and wielding "greater influence in the general conversation about the industry."
"We don't want to be the next Goldman, Sachs or Morgan Stanley," Mr. Olivo said. "We're just trying to become the most influential investment bank in the new economy."

HEADLINE: Extent of Telephone Strike May Have Surprised Target

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO 

 BODY:
As Verizon Communications prepares to enter its fifth day of bargaining with its striking unions, the question arises: Has Verizon received more than it bargained for with this strike?
The walkout by 86,000 workers of Verizon, the nation's largest telecommunications employer, has developed into one of the largest and most unruly strikes in years, raising questions about the company's preparation for the contract talks and its handling of the walkout. 
 Management was distracted for the first six months of the year by the completion of the merger of Bell Atlantic and GTE, which created the newly named Verizon. And then the company was eager to embark on a huge advertising and promotional campaign to establish the new Verizon brand. Did those distractions lead the company's management to underestimate the unions' intent to transform the Aug. 5 contract deadline into a point of reference for organized labor's future in high-technology companies?
"I think there probably was a certain amount of arrogance here on management's part," said Neil Bernstein, a professor of law at Washington University in St. Louis who also works as a labor arbitrator. "Telephone companies have generally not been overly concerned about strikes, mainly because their services are so automated."
The company denies that it underestimated the challenge of reaching a new contract. "No company ever wants a strike, and we most certainly did everything we could to prevent one," said Eric Rabe, Verizon's spokesman. "Sometimes it's just necessary to get eyeball to eyeball on issues."
Instead of a token walkout like the two-day strike by Bell Atlantic's unions two years ago, Verizon has received a mounting public relations problem.
The company's customers in the 12 Eastern states and Washington, where the strike is taking place, are unable to reach directory assistance. And regionwide, requests for repairs have swelled to 82,000, compared with 36,000 at this time last month.
Negotiations between Verizon and the two unions representing its employees, the Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, deteriorated yesterday, reducing chances for a quick resolution, according to people close to the talks.
And on the picket lines, tension has increased between management and strikers. The unions said yesterday that nine picketers had been hit by managers' vehicles in separate incidents, but that none were hospitalized. Verizon said that union members had thrown bottles, rocks and eggs at managers trying to enter company buildings.
So far, 24 union members throughout the region have been arrested during the strike, according to the company.
A profit warning from the company on Tuesday sent shares in Verizon down more than 12 percent, and yesterday they fell an additional 3.7 percent, to $40.50 a share. Since June, shares in Verizon, the nation's largest provider of local telephone and wireless service, have fallen nearly 30 percent, to a two-year low.
The company's woes come amid a nationwide advertising campaign that began on Aug. 1, using actors including James Earl Jones to make people more aware of the new name, which is pronounced vah-RISE-un. And even as chances of a strike mounted before the deadline of 12:01 a.m. last Sunday set by the union, Verizon chose to proceed with its advertising plans.
"This is clearly not the association you want to build as you launch a new brand," said Martin Tipping, director of naming at Landor Associates, a corporate identity consulting company. "At least people are learning how to pronounce the name."
According to people involved in the talks, an indication of Verizon's handling of the negotiations came in the minutes leading up to the deadline. Only then did Verizon make concessions to one of the unions' main demands, which would allow them to organize in the company's fast-growing wireless division.
By that time, though, it was too late to avoid a strike. While Verizon had also made wage and benefit concessions that the unions found satisfactory, other issues remained stumbling blocks. They included the use of nonunion contractors and the relocation of some work in response to the merger or changing corporate priorities.
Labor experts say it appears Verizon did not correctly gauge the unions' readiness to turn the strike opportunity into a sounding board for labor's place in the new economy.
"This strike is pivotal because the unions are confronting changes produced by rapid technological advances," said Richard Hurd, professor of labor issues at Cornell University.
The unions are not emerging from the strike with their image unscathed. One union member was arrested today for harrassing a Verizon manager at a company building in Manhattan. And the New York City Police Department has been investigating the possibility that strikers have been involved in numerous acts of vandalism that have knocked out telephone service in some parts of the city.
In Manhattan yesterday, five police officers from the Midtown South Precinct who were monitoring picket lines were doused with bird excrement and other waste dumped from the top of Verizon's 41-story headquarters building on the Avenue of the Americas at 42nd Street.
The officers were taken to Bellevue Hospital and treated for exposure to animal feces.
"We're not going to rule out management or strikers," said Sgt. Andrew McInnis, a spokesman for the police department.

HEADLINE: Layoffs May Be at a Record Low, Survey Finds

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
With the American economy enjoying its longest economic expansion on record, the number of permanent layoffs declined over the last three years, the government reported yesterday. The rate may now match the lowest in the 20-year history of the survey.
The new data also shows that women are now laid off virtually as often as men, closing a wide gap that had existed for most of the last 20 years. At the same time, the layoff rate for blacks rose. And the gap between the layoff rate for blacks compared with whites widened significantly over the last three years. The layoff rate for Hispanics, however, dropped sharply, falling below that of blacks. The differential between whites and Hispanics also narrowed. 
 During the three years ended with 1999, 3.3 million workers on the job for three years or more were laid off while 4.3 million workers on the job for less than three years lost their jobs, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported in its biennial job displacement survey. This compares with total layoffs of 8 million, 3.6 million of them on the job for three years or more, from 1995 to 1997. And that is down from a total of 8.4 million in the period from 1993 through 1995.
The decline in layoffs is more pronounced when calculated as a percentage of all employed workers. According to the bureau, that rate declined to 6.1 percent in the last three years, from 6.6 percent in 1995 through 1997 and 8 percent in 1993 through 1995. And this 6.1 percent may be near or even match the low for the survey, which goes back to 1979.
The first bureau survey was released in 1984. But because the way the survey was conducted was changed from five-year periods to three-year periods in the report released in 1994, it is difficult to make historical comparisons. Steve Hipple, the economist at the bureau who oversees the job displacement data, said that the rate of job layoffs was probably understated in the earlier data.
If this is the case, the 6.1 percent layoff rate from the last three years may actually be equal to the 5.5 percent rate reported for 1987 through 1989, the low point in the bureau's data.
But the decline in the layoff rate in the last three years was far less than in the preceding three years, when the rate for all workers 20 years and older fell 17.5 percent.
"It is not surprising that in a strong job market that job loss declined," said Henry Farber, an economist at Princeton University who studies job displacement data. He said that even with a strong economy, there would be layoffs as some industries shrink while others grow.
The lowest layoff rate, 5.7 percent, was for workers 45 to 54. Of all the displaced workers, nearly three-quarters had new jobs by the time the survey was taken in February. Nearly three-fifths of those laid off from wage and salary jobs found new jobs that paid the same or more.
While the layoff rate for blacks did increase to 7.3 percent, it is still significantly below the level earlier in the 1990's, when it was as high as 9.4 percent between 1991 and 1995. The increase in the difference between the layoff rate for blacks and whites ends six years of narrowing. In the three-year period from 1991 through 1993, the gap was 1.4 percentage points. It narrowed to 0.5 percentage point in the next three-year period and was 0.6 percentage point in 1995 though 1997.
Mr. Hipple could not say why the gap had widened again. He said that the existence of a gap was consistent with the fact that the unemployment rate for whites is lower than that for blacks. But he said that it was hard to tell whether this year's widening of the gap was a one-time event or not.
Mr. Farber, who has worked with the bureau's jobs data for years, could not comment in detail on the change in the layoff rates for blacks because he had not yet received the backup data on which yesterday's release was based. But he said "the black number is an interesting number and something to point out."
The layoff rate of Hispanics fell to 7 percent over the last three years from 8.8 percent. That is the lowest it has been since the the 1990-91 recession. The gap between the white and Hispanic layoff rate narrowed to 1 percentage point from 2.3 percentage points in the 1995-97 period.
The gap between the layoff rate for women and men has been narrowing over the last 20 years, with the biggest changes coming in times of strong job growth. In 1991-93, the gap was 7.4 percent for women and 8.8 percent for men. That narrowed to 7.6 percent for women and 8.4 percent for men in 1993-95, to 6.5 percent for women and 6.7 percent for men in 1995-97 and to 6.1 percent for women and 6 percent for men in the last three years.
"Women's jobs are concentrated in service industries and the risk of job losses in services industries has grown over time," Mr. Hipple said.

HEADLINE: Arrest of Banker in Graft Case Poses a Test of Bosnia's Resolve

BYLINE: By CARLOTTA GALL 

DATELINE: SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Aug. 8

 BODY:
The arrest of a prominent Bosnian banker and former government minister is being watched by foreign officials here as a test of the government's resolve to fight corruption.
The suspect, Alija Delimustafic, an owner of BH Banka, which collapsed two years ago owing foreign embassies and international organizations $15 million, was arrested on Friday night and charged with fraud and abusing his position. 
 But the case "is not just about money going missing," a foreign official here said.
"It is a very, very high-profile fraud case," the official said. "It's an important test case, and we want to see it succeed."
Local news media have hinted that the affair goes to the core of the Bosnian leadership in Sarajevo, some of whose members were Mr. Delimustafic's close colleagues in the war from 1992 to 1995. The government has been silent on the case.
Foreign officials here say corruption has reached such levels that the powerful vested interests of the governing parties are the major obstruction to democracy and development in Bosnia, as a recent report by the General Accounting Office said.
Mr. Delimustafic, 46, was arrested at the offices of his company Cenex, which ran the collapsed bank and still controls a trading company, supermarket chain and an insurance company. The well-connected businessman was interior minister in the early 90's. In the war, he was foreign trade minister of a collapsed country that had almost no trade and only the most tenuous links to the outside world.
According to Mirsad Bajraktarevic, head of the 120-member financial police unit that is investigating corruption in Bosnia, BH Banka collapsed with debts of $15 million. Some $900,000 of that total belonged to the United States Agency for International Development and represented operating funds and loan payments of its assistance programs to Bosnia, according to the General Accounting Office report. The Swiss Embassy has also acknowledged losing a significant sum.
None of the foreign creditors has retrieved money since the bank crashed, and they have pushed the government hard to investigate the case. Cenex has continued trading, and creditors have set their sights on its assets, particularly a shopping center on the southern edge of Sarajevo.
The center was probably built with some of the missing money, Mr. Bajraktarevic said in an interview. "And the bank made credits beyond its means," he said, adding that the credits were not insured.
Mr. Bajraktarevic's task has been to track the dealings of the bank over the last 10 years. He transferred the case to the prosecutor's office last month.
"It is very complex," he said. "Twenty people were involved in setting up the bank, and a lot of transfers were made out of the country, and Bosnia has not signed any international conventions."
PricewaterhouseCoopers has been brought in to audit the bank, he said.
The representative for the World Bank here, Elaine Patterson, noted that banks in transitional economies are fragile and crashes are to be expected before regulations are in place. But the World Bank, itself a victim of fraud in Bosnia, has pressed hard for a full investigation and pursuit of the banks' assets to pay back creditors.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE RACE FOR CONTRIBUTIONS;
Fund-Raisers for 2 Clintons Set for Eve of Convention

BYLINE: By DON VAN NATTA Jr. and JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 9

 BODY:
Vice President Al Gore has for months been planning the Democratic National Convention as a coming-out party for his presidential campaign and a long-awaited opportunity to step out of President Clinton's imposing shadow.
But Bill and Hillary Clinton each intend to spend twice as much time in Los Angeles as the vice president, basking in the spotlight and raising millions of dollars for their own political projects. 
 By the end of the Democratic convention week, the Clintons will have raised far more money than the vice president -- $4 million anticipated for the first lady's New York Senate bid at a star-studded concert this Saturday night and at least $10 million for Mr. Clinton's presidential library at a brunch that Barbra Streisand will hold this Sunday at her compound in Malibu. Each of 50 couples at the brunch has committed at least $100,000, and some more than $1 million, to the president's library in Little Rock, Ark.
Ms. Streisand will also lend her cachet to Mr. Gore's campaign, headlining a concert at the Shrine Auditorium next Thursday that is expected to raise at least $2.5 million for the Democratic National Committee. Ms. Streisand will sing three songs.
Some Gore aides and senior Democratic fund-raisers are angry about the Clinton-heavy convention schedule, saying they are concerned the Clinton events will siphon off Hollywood money that would be better spent assisting the Gore-Lieberman ticket.
The stacked social calendar has also rankled some wealthy Southern California Democrats, who say they have been bombarded by invitations to fund-raisers and appeals for money. Finally, the political ailment known as "donor fatigue" may have hit Hollywood.
"This is Gore's convention, but there are two tributes to Clinton," said a Democratic strategist who insisted on anonymity. "It's embarrassing for the Gores to have this huge event for the president that will raise money for Hillary. This convention is not about her."
How can it be that three people who work in the same complex and whose careers have been intimately entwined for the past eight years seem unable to coordinate what should be one of the most important events of the Clinton era?
But, in fact, not only is there little coordination between the Gore presidential campaign and Mrs. Clinton's Senate campaign, but there is also competition between Mr. Gore and Mrs. Clinton for money and attention, most dramatically at the coming Democratic convention.
And for his part, the president is trying to balance the needs of both candidates, while burnishing his legacy and raising tens of millions of dollars for his presidential library.
The highly visible events spotlighting President Clinton and his wife in Los Angeles are not only troubling to the Gore forces because they drain money. They also put the Clintons at center stage just as the vice president and his ticket-mate are trying to occupy that territory and distance themselves from Mr. Clinton.
Even one adviser to Mrs. Clinton said today that it might have been inappropriate for the first lady to use Mr. Gore's nominating convention as a venue to raise money for her Senate campaign.
Several Gore allies said today that they were not worried about the money, but they acknowledged that the symbolism would be unmistakable: on the eve of Mr. Gore's national moment, all of Hollywood will turn out to honor Mr. Clinton, not once but twice.
Convention organizers had already faced a delicate balancing act in deciding a role for the Clintons. It was partly addressed when the president and first lady agreed to address the delegates at the Staples Center on the convention's opening night. Afterward, the president will be saluted by the Democratic Party's top donors at Paramount Studios; the Clintons will then leave Los Angeles on Tuesday morning.
But the competition over fund-raising demonstrates that the competition between the two camps is not fully resolved.
The headline event is Saturday night at a private Los Angeles estate. More than 1,400 people will attend a salute to the president, with the proceeds going to Mrs. Clinton's Senate campaign. Among the performers will be Paul Anka, Michael Bolton, Toni Braxton, Cher, Melissa Etheridge, Patti LaBelle, Brian McKnight, Diana Ross, Mark McGrath of Sugar Ray, Stevie Wonder and Luther Vandross. And there will be tributes on stage by Ted Danson, Michael Douglas, Whoopi Goldberg, Goldie Hawn, Angelica Huston, Jack Lemmon, Shirley MacLaine, Dylan McDermott, Rosa Parks, Gregory Peck, Jimmy Smits, Mary Steenburgen, John Travolta and Red Buttons.
The host of the Saturday night concert is Stan Lee, the comic book publishing icon and creator of Spider-Man. Aaron Tonken, a consultant for Stan Lee Media who recruited the talent, played down the talk in Los Angeles that the concert would overshadow Mr. Gore's own concert on Thursday night. But he also acknowledged that Mrs. Clinton was sensitive about the event.
"Mrs. Clinton's campaign office pushed very hard for me to help get as much talent as possible for the vice president's event," Mr. Tonken said. "She has been very sensitive and almost pushy for me to help the vice president."
Mr. Gore's event on Thursday night at the 6,000-seat Shrine Auditorium features a concert by Ms. Streisand, as well as appearances by Whoopi Goldberg, Baby Face, Boyz II Men and Gladys Knight. Tickets range from $150 to $20,000. A few $1,000 tickets are still unsold.
The Saturday night tribute to the president also caused some concern among members of the host committee, who scheduled the media party for the same night.
Garry South, a top political adviser to Gov. Gray Davis of California, acknowledged that there had been competing demands for entertainers to draw donors to Democratic fund-raisers. "Some competition for talent is inevitable," he said. "There's been some jostling here about the whole thing."
Mr. South said that aides to Mrs. Clinton called him several weeks ago to propose a major soft-money fund-raiser on Saturday night with top entertainment figures. He said he did not advise against it -- in fact, Governor Davis is a co-sponsor of the event -- but warned the Clinton campaign that she would be competing with numerous other fund-raising events during convention week.
"From a practical standpoint, I told them they'd have to do it in a way that doesn't distract from other activities, including the salute to President Clinton on Monday and the concert for Gore and the D.N.C. Thursday night," Mr. South said.
"We get this in California all the time," Mr. South said. "There are a zillion people coming out here all year long in ongoing and nonstop fund-raising activities."
He added, "All three events will come off smashingly and everybody will be happy as a clam and everybody will make a lot of clams."
A supporter of the Clintons complained that the Saturday night concert benefiting Mrs. Clinton's Senate campaign had "spun out of control," saying the organizers "don't care about Hillary and the president -- they are promoting themselves, and politically, this just hurts Hillary."
But a senior Gore adviser played down concerns about Mrs. Clinton's fund-raiser, saying: "We welcome the event for Hillary. If any of our fund-raisers think we are being hurt by her events, they are just wrong. The phones are ringing off the hook. We are doing great." The adviser, who refused to be identified, acknowledged that there had been "grumbling" among fund-raisers, but added that fund-raisers often complained about the hard task of raising money.
And Howard Wolfson, Mrs. Clinton's spokesman, also said his candidate was not draining resources from Mr. Gore. "Thanks to the very strong economy created under the Clinton-Gore administration, there is more than enough to go around," Mr. Wolfson said.
One generous Democratic contributor in the entertainment business turned down an invitation to the Sunday brunch at Ms. Streisand's home. He described the event to an aide as "a heavy ticket" requiring a donation of $100,000 to $1 million in a year when demand for political money was already intense.
He told the aide he might consider contributing to the library project next year or later, but felt he had done more than enough for the party this year.
After leaving Los Angeles on Tuesday morning, the president will travel to Michigan for an appearance with the vice president at a symbolic passing of the torch. Mr. Gore will then depart for Los Angeles.

HEADLINE: The Buchanan Coup Attempt

 BODY:
Eight years after the establishment of the Reform Party by Ross Perot, the party's machinery has apparently been seized -- or disabled -- by Patrick Buchanan, longtime scold on the Republican right. As a presidential candidate, Mr. Buchanan has little to offer the American public except the politics of resentment. But if he gets the Reform Party's presidential nomination this week, his tirades against free trade, affirmative action and abortion may draw votes away from Gov. George W. Bush, unless they help Mr. Bush by making him seem more moderate. In any case, it is enough to make one nostalgic for Mr. Perot, the eccentric Texas billionaire who founded the party.
Despite Mr. Perot's comical behavior, the Reform Party has drawn support from a wide range of well-intentioned Americans who wanted to elevate the tone of politics. For them it is especially unfortunate that Mr. Buchanan's takeover attempts have been less about issues than about getting his hands on the more than $12 million in federal campaign funds due the party because of Mr. Perot's past showings on the ballot. 
 Today the party opens its convention in Long Beach, Calif., where Mr. Buchanan says he expects to be nominated after working hard all year to take over the party organization state by state. Anti-Buchanan members are charging fraud, and contend that if they cannot stop his selection at the convention they will break off and form a separate Reform Party with its own nominee. A court battle over who gets the $12 million is considered likely.
The high-water mark of Mr. Perot's candidacy occurred in the spring of 1992, when it seemed plausible that he could actually beat President Bush and the Democratic challenger, Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas. But Mr. Perot's odd tactical reversals -- dropping out of the race suddenly and, just as suddenly, jumping back in -- and his paranoid-sounding charges of conspiracies against him and his family did him in. Nevertheless, he brought a certain truth-telling to the 1992 campaign, warning of the dangers of federal deficits, the power of special interests and what he said was declining American competitiveness abroad. In his 1996 race he was far less credible as a candidate.
The only policy that Mr. Buchanan has picked up from the old Perot campaign is opposition to trade agreements. His moralizing and demands for anti-abortion laws run counter to the libertarian streak of many Reform Party members, including Gov. Jesse Ventura of Minnesota.
When Mr. Buchanan walked out of the Republican Party last fall, Governor Bush lamented his loss to the G.O.P. In fact, the party was fortunate to be rid of his nasty brand of nativism and his divisive rants about cultural war and the "Israeli lobby." In these generally prosperous economic times, it is fair enough for Mr. Buchanan to try to call attention to the problems of those not benefiting from the boom. But it is doubtful that his flame-throwing attacks on his ever-changing list of foreign and domestic enemies will elevate the race this year. The Reform Party would do better to nominate a candidate appealing to idealism rather than the paranoid fringe.

HEADLINE: STUDY SAID TO FIND U.S. MISSILE SHIELD MIGHT INCITE CHINA

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 9

 BODY:
A highly classified intelligence report warns that deploying an American national missile defense could prompt China to expand its nuclear arsenal tenfold and lead Russia to place multiple warheads on ballistic missiles that now carry only one, according to officials who have reviewed it.
Although the report reaffirms what China and Russia have publicly said in opposition to the system, it offers a detailed analysis of how those two nations are likely to respond and suggests that the effects of an American decision to build a nuclear defense would ripple around the globe from Europe to South Asia, the officials said. 
 It warns that China would expand its relatively small arsenal of roughly 20 long-range nuclear missiles to a quantity large enough to overwhelm the limited defensive system that the Clinton administration is considering. One person who has seen the report said it estimated that China could deploy up to 200 warheads by 2015, prompting India and Pakistan to respond with their own buildups.
Although Russia's economy is unlikely to support a large buildup of its missile forces, officials said the report found that it could again deploy shorter-range missiles along its borders and resume adding multiple warheads to its ballistic missiles. That is something Russia agreed to stop as part of the second strategic arms control treaty, or Start 2, which it ratified this year.
The report, "Foreign Responses to U.S. National Missile Defense Deployment," underscores warnings by opponents here and abroad that the administration's proposal to build a limited defensive system could lead to a new arms race with Russia and, to a lesser extent, in Asia.
The report does not recommend for or against a national missile defense, but simply spells out potential consequences. Although it makes clear that some of those consequences could be dire, the study also underscores the emerging threat to the United States from the proliferation of ballistic missiles, which advocates have long cited as the rationale for building a system.
President Clinton, who received a copy in the last few days, has said he would make a decision on whether to go ahead with the system this year based on four criteria, including two covered by the report, the threat to and the effects on overall national security, including arms control. The other criteria are the cost and the technological feasibility.
This week, Defense Secretary William S. Cohen said he would delay until at least next month making a recommendation to the president on the system. He cited "a number of difficult issues" that have to be resolved. The secretary, who has been briefed on the intelligence findings, is supposed to base his recommendation in part on the effects addressed in the report.
The report, which is expected to be sent to members of Congress on Thursday, is sure to fuel the debate over whether Mr. Clinton should approve the first steps toward a defensive shield or postpone the decision until the next administration. An official who has seen the report said it included assessments that critics and supporters of a missile defense would use "and make no one happy."
And it could affect the presidential campaign. Vice President Al Gore has largely embraced the adminstration stand of building a limited land-based system. The Republican candidate, George W. Bush, favors a broader system that could include sea- and space-based arms.
The report includes an annex that repeats the intelligence assessment last year that Iraq, Iran and North Korea could develop ballistic missiles capable of hitting the United States by 2015, the officials said. In fact, the threat from North Korea may be more imminent, despite a flurry of diplomatic activity by North Korea, the officials said.
Although North Korea has abided by a pledge that it made last year not to test its long-range missiles, it has continued building a three-stage missile that could hit the United States and could deploy it "in reasonably short order," one official said.
The report, a National Intelligence Estimate, represents the collective assessment of the nation's intelligence agencies, including the Central Intelligence Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency and the State Department Bureau of Intelligence and Research. One senior official said the report did not intend to predict with certainty how China, Russia and other countries would respond, but rather simply laid out a range of responses.
Another official, arguing that the report did not necessarily undercut the case for a missile defense, said some of the findings represented worst-case scenarios. The report says, for example, that the Russians could withdraw from "an array of arms control treaties," especially if the United States went ahead without negotiating changes in the Antiballistic Missile Treaty of 1972, which prohibits national missile defenses.
The official noted that although Russia had so far strongly resisted Washington's efforts to change the treaty, they have an interest in negotiating reductions in both countries' nuclear arsenals, because Russia can scarcely afford to maintain the 5,000 or so warheads that it has.
The report suggests that the Russians could accept a trade-off that would strictly limit the American defensive system to 100 interceptor missiles based in Alaska, as the administration has proposed building by 2007. But without an agreement, Russia could respond by increasing the warheads on each missile.

HEADLINE: 15 Awarded Highest Civilian Honor

BYLINE: By MARC LACEY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 9

 BODY:
Presi dents hand out plenty of perks ambassadorships, invitations to state dinners and specially made boxes of M&M's bearing the presidential seal.
With just five months left in his term, and his opportunities for presenting awards dwindling, President Clinton today awarded 15 people with Presidential Medals of Freedom, the country's highest civilian honor. Some of the awards seemed to represent belated presidential thank-yous. Some clearly had a political twist. At least one was a consolation prize. 
In announcing the awards, Mr. Clinton said he had huddled with his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is running for the Senate in New York, to review the upstanding people from all walks of life nominated by aides and others.
The honorees included John Kenneth Galbraith, the Harvard economist, Msgr. George G. Higgins, a labor activist, and the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who is Mr. Clinton's envoy to Africa.
Although the selection process is cloaked in mystery, Mrs. Clinton perhaps had a role in advocating for Marian Wright Edelman, her first boss at the Children's Defense Fund; the Rev. Gardner C. Taylor, a prominent pastor from Brooklyn who has backed her campaign; and Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the man she hopes to succeed in the Senate.
The award was a consolation prize for Gen. Wesley K. Clark, who was NATO's supreme commander during the bombing of Yugoslavia but who was passed over for the post of chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Now an investment banker, General Clark wore a suit instead of a uniform but still stood ramrod straight.
Mr. Clinton, over the course of his presidency, has handed out 83 of the gold medallions decorated with red, white and blue. There are no limits to the number of medals that can be awarded, and although the White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said this was the final medal ceremony of the year, he added, "The president always reserves the right to do something on a more ad-hoc basis near the end of the administration."
Mr. Clinton has always reached out to Republicans when presenting the awards. Bob Dole won the honor the year after he lost to Mr. Clinton in the 1996 presidential race. Former President Gerald R. Ford joined former President Jimmy Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, in in 1999. This year, Senator John H. Chafee, Republican of Rhode Island, won the award posthumously. Mr. Chafee died in October.
The other honorees were Simon Wiesenthal, the Holocaust survivor and Nazi hunter; Cruz Reynoso, a former judge from California who is vice chairman of the United States Commission on Civil Rights; George McGovern, a former Democratic presidential nominee; James Edward Burke, chairman of the Partnership for a Drug-Free America; Adm. William Crowe, a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Mildred Jeffrey, a labor activist; and Mathilde Krim, founder of the American Foundation for AIDS Research.
"It's the highest honor of my life," said Mr. McGovern said. "I treasure it even more than running for the presidency of the United States. If I had won, that would have been the greatest honor."
Then, of course, he would have been the one handing out medals.

HEADLINE: No Rise in Child Abuse Seen in Welfare Shift

BYLINE: By SOMINI SENGUPTA 

 BODY:
When Congress abolished welfare as a permanent safety net four years ago, there were alarming predictions about the prospect of an already overwhelmed foster care system's being flooded by a new wave of abused children. But according to the early findings of two studies, the changes do not appear to have had such dire effects across the country.
Confirmed cases of child abuse and neglect have fallen since 1996, the researchers involved in the studies say. Their conclusions are confirmed by federal statistics released yesterday reporting that there were 903,000 cases of child maltreatment in 1998, compared with 969,000 in 1996 and 1,019,000 in the peak year of 1993. 
 One study notes, too, that while data is limited, the number of children entering foster care has been stable or falling slightly in recent years, continuing the national decline that began slightly more than five years ago, after the worst period of crack cocaine addiction. In 1999, 3.30 children out of every 1,000 entered foster care, according to one study, down from 3.87 in 1994.
Perhaps no other forecast to stem from the 1996 welfare overhaul was as chilling as the predictions regarding foster care. At the time, some advocates for the poor and child welfare officials feared that the stress of losing benefits or the pressures of having to work for a welfare check would lead to a rise in child abuse and neglect.
But the latest findings suggest that since President Clinton signed the 1996 legislation placing strict time limits and work obligations on much of the country's welfare recipients, their children do not seem to have flooded into foster care.
That somewhat heartening picture comes at a time when children's overall well-being has improved slightly. Child poverty, infant mortality and birth rates for teenagers declined noticeably in the 1990's, a study released last month by the Federal Interagency Forum on Child and Family Statistics found.
"I don't think the picture is entirely rosy, but there is little evidence, if any, to suggest that there's a large population negatively affected," said Rob Geen, a senior research associate with the Urban Institute, a research organization based in Washington that is conducting a study of the impact of the welfare changes.
Researchers and policy analysts caution, however, that certain states and certain families show signs of trouble that deserve closer attention. There are, after all, many much less blunt ways of measuring possible damage to children other than foster care admissions -- from health conditions to juvenile delinquency.
"The concerns come in when you speak to individual workers and hear stories about specific families that have been affected by welfare reform," Mr. Geen said. "There are many of them, but they are not large enough or well documented enough to show up in the aggregate numbers."
The full and lasting impact of welfare changes on children and family well-being will most likely play out over the next several years, because different states are on different schedules for putting the law's changes into effect.
Some states imposed work requirements or time limits on welfare recipients before the 1996 federal laws took effect. In other states, time limits have not kicked in. Officials with the Urban Institute, as well as those with the Chapin Hall Center for Children at the University of Chicago, who have conducted a study of welfare families in Illinois, consequently warn that the snapshot they have so far developed is an early one.
For now, even if the most dire predictions do not appear to have been realized, how much of that can be attributed to the success of an overhaul of welfare remains imprecise. Other trends -- chiefly, the general economic health of the country, declining rates of child poverty, and unrelated changes in child welfare policies -- could also be responsible. Nor is it clear what would have happened to foster care caseloads in the absence of changes in welfare.
Some children, the researchers contend, may be getting by without welfare because their parents have found work. Some children who are being neglected may not show up on the radar of child welfare workers because their families are no longer on government assistance. Other at-risk families may be temporarily shielded by relatives and friends.
In raising concerns that foster care systems would be burdened by an influx of vulnerable children, advocates noted that poverty is the greatest single ingredient in the mistreatment or neglect of children. Many experts wondered, then, whether under a welfare overhaul more children would land in foster care and whether more of them would languish there for longer because judges might be reluctant to return children to homes with empty pantries.
"Nearly everyone we spoke with expected to see significant negative effects from welfare reform on child welfare," Mr. Geen said. "There's no evidence to suggest that there has been a substantial impact."
He adds, however, that there is scattered evidence of trouble that merits close examination. In some states, like Michigan, child neglect reports based on lack of supervision have spiked sharply. Mr. Geen said state child welfare workers told him they believed that the increase reflected, in part, new welfare-to-work requirements, with mothers now having to leave their children unattended. But the increase, Mr. Geen said, could be due to other changes.
Mr. Geen's report is based on aggregate data and interviews with 500 policymakers, welfare office workers, child welfare caseworkers, advocates and other experts in 12 states: Alabama, California, Colorado, Florida, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin.
State by state figures will not be released until Mr. Geen's report is published later this year.
In Michigan, New Jersey, Texas and Washington, the number of child abuse and neglect investigations increased significantly from 1996 through 1998, the most recent year for which figures are available. Mr. Geen said state officials attributed those increases not to welfare changes, but to other factors in child welfare policies, like changes in screening policies. He said the number of substantiated cases declined in all but one of the 12 states in that same period.
In more than half of the 12, welfare workers filed more child neglect reports than in the past. But case workers who investigate those reports noted that many of the referrals were inappropriate, Mr. Geen said.
Meanwhile, the Chapin Hall study similarly concluded that child welfare indicators had not taken a turn for the worse since the welfare law changed. Neither abuse and neglect reports, nor the number of children coming into foster care, has gone up in Illinois since 1996, it found.
"That's not entirely due to the success of welfare reform," said Robert Goerge, associate director of Chapin Hall. "We have a very strong economy and that generally results in fewer reports of abuse and neglect and fewer children going into foster care."
At the same time, Illinois embarked on a major overhaul of its child welfare system, seeking to get more children into permanent homes and trying to prevent children from coming into the formal foster care system.
Therein lies the difficulty of understanding the impact of welfare policy changes on children's lives. The ebb and flow of foster care numbers is driven by everything from widely publicized incidents of child fatalities, like the Elisa Izquierdo case in New York City, which significantly drove up abuse reports, to crack cocaine addiction, which drove up foster care numbers to record levels in the early 1990's.
"We still don't have full information on whether requiring parents to go to work and threatening to cut off their aid actually improves the welfare of their children or prevents abuse and neglect," Mr. Goerge said. "But it is certainly the case that welfare reform hasn't made things worse."
The number of families on welfare has dropped by 50 percent since 1993, to 2,453,000 in September 1999, according to figures released recently by the federal Department of Health and Human Services. So far, many single mothers on welfare have found jobs and have seen some increase in their income, according to a study by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a research organization in Washington. But since the new welfare laws took effect, the incomes of 1.8 million families have declined, to $8,400 a year on average, compared with $8,760 in 1995. The center has not specifically inquired what has happened to their children.
According to federal data, in New York State the welfare caseload has shrunk by one-third since 1993, to 279,692 families in September 1999, most of them in New York City. Of those who have left the rolls, city officials cannot say how many have found work. Nor is much known about the general well-being of their families, including their encounters with the city's child welfare agency.
Those who are left on the rolls, some social policy analysts say, may be the ones who are the most ill-prepared to make it on their own. They may be impeded by mental illness or substance abuse, or they may be victims of domestic violence -- the same conditions that may also place their children at greater risk of abuse and neglect. Their prospects may not be discerned until a year or two from now.
"People want to know the answers now," Mr. Geen said. "But everyone we spoke to said, 'Please come back in two years and we'll have a different story to tell you.' "

MANHATTAN: WEST NILE MEETING URGED
A coalition of New York environmentalists, repeating their view yesterday that widespread pesticide spraying against the West Nile virus may threaten the public more than the virus itself, said they had asked to meet with Dr. Neal L. Cohen, New York City's health commissioner. "The overuse of toxic pesticides to combat this virus creates an insidious air of false security," said Adrienne Esposito, of the Citizens Campaign for the Environment. A Health Department spokeswoman said yesterday that Dr. Cohen had not yet received the request. Eric Lipton (NYT) 

MANHATTAN: FIRE DISRUPTS ELECTRICITY
A smoky electrical fire in a manhole on West 80th Street last night knocked out power to 59 customers, Consolidated Edison said. The cause of the fire at West 80th and Columbus Avenue, which started at 11:15 p.m. and burned some underground cables before being put out an hour later, was not clear, Con Ed and the Fire Department said. The utility did not know early this morning when service would be restored, said D. Joy Faber, a spokeswoman. Andy Newman (NYT)
 
BROOKLYN: STOP SIGN INSTALLED BEFORE PROTEST
One month after a 9-year-old boy was hit by a car and killed at the intersection and one day before a neighborhood protest was planned there, the Department of Transportation agreed to install a stop sign on 24th Avenue at 83rd Street in Brooklyn. Local residents and elected officials had lobbied for a sign for years. Carmine Santa Maria, president of the Bensonhurst West End Community Council, said the avenue from 86th Street to Stillwell Avenue had no lights or stop signs and had been the scene of many accidents.

A Kew Gardens man has pleaded guilty to posing as a dentist in Jamaica, Queens, and treating more than 100 Medicaid patients. Since last August, the man, Ramin Setarehshenas, had operated an office called Colosseum Dental and had examined teeth, taken X-rays and written prescriptions, according to Attorney General Eliot L. Spitzer's office. Mr. Setarehshenas agreed to make $18,000 in restitution and faces up to four years in prison. Sentencing is scheduled for Oct. 17. (NYT)
 
MANHATTAN: ACTIVIST MISSING IN INDONESIA
Human Rights Watch, a human rights group based in Manhattan, urged the Indonesian government yesterday to increase efforts to find a lawyer and activist from Queens who vanished five days ago in Sumatra. The group said it feared that the lawyer, Jafar Siddiq Hamzah, 35, might have been kidnapped by Indonesian military or paramilitary troops on Saturday. The group said Indonesia's regional military commander had denied any knowledge of Mr. Hamzah's whereabouts, and appeals by the United States Embassy in Jakarta to the government had yielded no results.

SCHENECTADY: TURBOTRAINS ARRIVE
The first of seven turbocharged Amtrak trains has been delivered to Amtrak by Super Steel Schenectady. The train, designed to travel 125 miles per hour on part of the route between Schenectady and New York City, is being inspected and tested before it goes into service this autumn. The second of the seven trains will be delivered to Amtrak in coming months and the rest completed by late 2002, said Lynn Bowersox, an Amtrak spokeswoman. (AP)
 
SYRACUSE: INDIAN LAND CLAIMS
Testimony is to resume next week in the second phase of the Cayuga Indian Nation's land claims trial, in which the tribe is seeking nearly $2 billion in interest. The money would be added to a $36.9 million award granted by a jury in February. Judge Neal McCurn of Federal District Court ruled in 1994 that New York illegally acquired 64,027 acres of reservation land in Cayuga and Seneca Counties in 1795 and 1807. An economist for the Cayugas plans to testify that the state should pay $1.74 billion in interest calculated back to 1795. The Justice Department's economist says the interest should be $527.5 million, while the state's expert economist plans to argue that New York should pay $12.1 million. at most. (AP)

HARTFORD: SENTENCING IN UNDER-AGE SEX CASE A Superior Court judge on Tuesday agreed to reduce the sentence of a bus driver and self-proclaimed witch who was convicted of having sex with a 14-year-old boy. The woman, Kerri Lynn Patavino, 32, was convicted in 1997 for engaging in what was described as ritualistic sex with the boy while she was his bus driver at a Trumbull middle school. The judge cut the six-year sentence by a year after Ms. Patavino publicly apologized for the first time. She had previously denied the charges and had already served one year of her sentence. (NYT)
 
NEW JERSEY
 
TRENTON: MOST CRIMES FALL
Crime in New Jersey last year, with the exception of car theft, dropped about 6 percent from the year before, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman reported yesterday. Reports of murder dropped 11 percent, rape 13 percent, and domestic violence 1 percent. Motor vehicle theft, however, rose 1 percent. New Jersey's decline mirrors the national crime rate, which fell 7 percent last year. (NYT)
 
NEWARK: SUSPECT IN EARLIER ECSTASY ARREST
A college student charged last week in one of New Jersey's largest seizures of the drug Ecstasy had been arrested in New York City three weeks earlier on similar charges. On July 8, the student, Brian Juliano, 23, a senior at Monmouth University, was charged by police officers in Brooklyn with possession of 5,000 tablets of Ecstasy. He was free on bail when he was arrested at a New Jersey warehouse with, the police said, 45,000 doses of the drug, valued at $1.5 million. His lawyer said Mr. Juliano would plead not guilty in both cases. Andrew Jacobs (NYT)
 
GLASSBORO: SPRINKLERS AT COLLEGE DORMS
Spurred by a new state law and by the deaths of students in a fire at Seton Hall University, Rowan University has finished installing a new fire sprinkler system in time for fall classes. Rowan spent $1.9 million to install sprinklers in on-campus apartments and 17 dormitories, and spent nearly $143,000 on batteries for smoke detectors. In January, three students died in a Seton Hall University dormitory that had no sprinklers. A state law in July made such sprinklers necessary. (NYT)

John Wiley Leases Office in Hoboken

BYLINE: By Joseph P. Fried 

 BODY:
John Wiley & Sons, a leading publisher of scientific, medical and technical books based in Manhattan, has signed a lease for office space in Hoboken, N.J., where it plans to move its headquarters and 800 of its employees.
Wiley, whose headquarters have been at 605 Third Avenue, at 39th Street, since 1962, is to occupy eight floors of a 13-story office structure for which ground is to be broken next month, said Tony Cicatiello, a spokesman for SJP Properties, the developer. The building is one of two that SJP is constructing for a development called the Waterfront Corporate Center, part of a city plan to redevelop the Hoboken waterfront with office buildings, a hotel and housing. 
 The building Wiley is to occupy is expected to be completed in early 2002. Wiley's lease is for 400,000 square feet and has a 15-year term. A spokesman for the publishing house, Susan Spilka, declined to say what the rent would be.
With its business expanding, Wiley was seeking larger space, but was unable to find an affordable site in Manhattan, real estate specialists said. As part of an incentive package, the New Jersey Economic Development Authority approved a business employment incentive grant for Wiley that is expected to provide $7 million over the next 10 years. Ms. Spilka declined to say whether Wiley had asked the New York City government for economic benefits to remain in the city.
Among other major companies that have recently found office space across the Hudson is Chase Manhattan Bank, which said in June that it would move several thousand employees from Lower Manhattan to Jersey City but would retain its headquarters at 270 Park Avenue in Manhattan. Joseph P. Fried

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
The rich may get richer, but numbers suggest the poor are doing better, too.

BYLINE: By Virginia Postrel; This column appears here every Thursday. Virginia Postrel is the editor at large of Reason magazine and the author of "The Future and Its Enemies: The Growing Conflict Over Creativity, Enterprise and Progress." Four economic analysts -- Ms. Postrel, Jeff Madrick, Alan B. Krueger and Hal R. Varian -- rotate as contributors.

 BODY:
THE rich are getting richer, and the poor are getting poorer, right? You'll hear that riff plenty this election year, if not from the major party candidates then from Ralph Nader and Pat Buchanan. It's a populist truism, Exhibit A in the case against the economy's recent dynamism.
But what if increasing inequality is mostly a myth -- an artifact of misleading data and changing lifestyles? What if just about everyone is getting richer? 
 In his new book, "The Fourth Great Awakening and the Future of Egalitarianism" (University of Chicago Press), the iconoclastic economic historian Robert W. Fogel makes just that case. Professor Fogel, of the University of Chicago, won the 1993 Nobel Prize for his revisionist empirical work on such topics as the economics of slavery and the development of the railroads. Here, he marshals data not just on income but on spending, time use, calorie consumption and health measures like life expectancy and height.
What he finds is good news indeed: a century of stunning material progress and improved physical well-being in the United States and the rest of the industrialized world. Poorer people have been the big winners. "In every measure that we have bearing on the standard of living, such as real income, homelessness, life expectancy, and height, the gains of the lower classes have been far greater than those experienced by the population as a whole, whose overall standard of living has also improved," Professor Fogel writes.
Most strikingly, technical and economic progress has bought us more time; we live longer, healthier lives and enjoy much more time to do what we want rather than what we must. In this, he notes, the poor have gained the most. A century ago, the lower your income, the more hours a year you worked to earn it -- a depressing prospect. Today, it's just the opposite.
Nowadays, the basics cost very little time. In 1880, for instance, covering a typical household's annual food bills cost 1,405 hours of labor, or about a half-year's wages back then, and those hours didn't include substantial unpaid time in the kitchen. A year's worth of food now costs a mere 260 hours of labor, and that price buys much greater variety and convenience, including a lot of restaurant meals.
One result is that Americans work many fewer hours each year. The free time of a typical working man has tripled over the last century. He now spends more time at leisure (not including sleeping, eating, commuting, chores and other basic activities) than at work. Women have enjoyed similar gains in leisure, mostly because they have a lot less housework.
Life expectancy, meanwhile, has increased 10 years just since 1950, mostly because people over 65 are living much longer. The age at which chronic problems like heart disease and arthritis set in keeps occurring later, and those ailments are less debilitating. This trend means many more active retirement years, which further adds to the huge increase in free time.
So what about the rising inequality we hear so much about? Professor Fogel argues that what looks like bad news over the last couple of decades mostly reflects individuals' different choices about how to use all this free time.
Take two men in the same occupation. One chooses to work long hours during middle age -- earning lots of overtime, advancing to the top corporate or partnership ranks or making it big in the start-up game -- so he can retire at 55. Another takes a more laid-back approach, avoiding the time commitments that would maximize his income and spending more time with his family and hobbies. He works until he's 65. Over the course of their lives, they may make about the same income. But in any given year, their incomes will be significantly different because of their choices about when to take their free time. This pattern intensifies when you add spouses pursuing similarly divergent choices.
In an appendix to Professor Fogel's book, Chulhee Lee, a former research associate at the University of Chicago and now an assistant professor at Seoul National University, presents evidence that increases in these sorts of variations account for much of what looks like a rise in income inequality from 1969 to 1989. Changes in how many heads of households and their spouses worked and how many hours they worked accounted for 54 percent of the rise in the spread between the highest 10 percent of household incomes and the lowest 10 percent. Changing wages, by contrast, accounted for less than 6 percent of the increase in the gap.
You might think these are signs of widespread, permanent unemployment among lower-income people. But Professor Lee found evidence to the contrary. As of 1994, 80 percent of those in the bottom 10 percent of incomes were spending more than they earned, an increase from about 53 percent in 1972-73. And the amount that 80 percent spent was about twice their incomes. Incomes look more lopsided, but the ratio of spending between the richest and poorest deciles has barely budged over time.
How can poor people spend significantly more than they earn? "You don't go to a bank and say, 'I'm very poor but worthy -- please give me some money,' " Professor Fogel said in an interview. Most likely, he said, they are using savings to finance either transient unemployment, which may be voluntary, or early retirement. Only a few of the poorest people stay poor over time, and the same is true for the richest, who tend to be at the peak of their earning years.
This evidence suggests that the apparent increase in inequality exists because more people with financial assets are taking breaks from work. That doesn't mean poverty has disappeared, of course, though its material hardships have lessened significantly. But it does suggest that identifying the real problems of the poor -- as most people understand that term -- requires a lot more nuance than aggregated income statistics provide. Focusing on snapshot inequality rather than on long-term life opportunities leads us to underestimate the country's enormous material progress and to overemphasize money as the solution to hard-core poverty.
Rather than worry about material inequality, Professor Fogel says, we should concern ourselves with the alienation that keeps a minority of the statistically poor from enjoying the self-realization our abundant time makes possible. Deciding what to do with that time, he argues, is something Americans of all income levels now face.
Today, he said: "People have the same problem that only the rich had, and that is, what do you do with your life? What is the good life? That was, from Socrates' time until the beginning of the 20th century, only an issue for the rich. Now it's becoming an issue for ordinary people. If you worked 3,000 hours a year, you didn't have a lot of time to wonder what to do with your life."

HEADLINE: Number in Prison Grows Despite Crime Reduction

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD 

 BODY:
After an eight-year drop in crime, the population of the nation's state and federal prisons grew last year at the lowest rate since 1979, 3.4 percent, the Justice Department reported yesterday.
The main reasons the prison population has increased even as crime has declined, the report said, are that the number of inmates returned to prison for parole violations increased, the length of the average sentence rose, and drug crimes, which are not included in the overall crime rate computed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, did not drop. 
 The number of inmates returned to prison after being released on parole during the 1990's grew by 54 percent, as parole agents became tougher about revoking parole for technical violations like failing a drug test. By contrast, the number of criminals sent to prison for new convictions rose only 7 percent.
The average length of time served was 28 months in 1998, up from 20 months in 1990, the report said, the result of tougher sentencing laws.
The report also found that the total number of Americans in all jails and prisons surpassed two million for the first time, reaching 2,026,596 at the end of 1999, the report said.
The report also found that Texas, which has been on a record-setting prison expansion under Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican presidential candidate, passed California as the state with the most prison inmates, though Texas has a much smaller population, 20 million people compared with 32 million in California. At the end of 1999, Texas had 163,190 inmates and California, 163,067.
In addition, the report said 9.4 percent of black men ages 25 to 29 were in state and federal prisons in 1999, almost 10 times the rate for white men in their late 20's, which was 1 percent. Among Hispanic males in their late 20's, 3.1 percent were in prison.
While the report highlighted the racial disparities in prison, it contradicted an assertion of advocates of prison and drug sentencing reform, who say most prisoners are locked up for drug arrests. In fact, the Justice Department found, people who had been convicted of violent crimes accounted for 51 percent of the increase in state prison populations from 1990 to 1998. Drug offenses accounted for 19 percent of the increase, property crimes accounted for 15 percent, and various other crimes accounted for 15 percent.
Altogether, in 1998, there were 545,200 state prison inmates serving time for violent offenses -- including murder, robbery, assault and rape -- compared with 242,900 for property crimes -- including burglary, auto theft and fraud -- and 236,800 for drug crimes.
Prisoners sentenced for drug crimes do predominate, the report said, in the federal system. Of the 108,925 federal inmates in 1998, 30,470 were sentenced for drug crimes, compared with 9,557 for violent crimes and 7,935 for property crimes.
Alfred Blumstein, a criminologist at Carnegie Mellon University, said a major finding of the study, written by Allen J. Beck of the Bureau of Justice Statistics, was that the continued growth of the prison population was driven by the huge increase in the number of parolees being returned to prison.
The report says most of those returning parolees have committed new crimes.
But Professor Blumstein said that the parole system had gotten tougher and that more parolees were being returned for violations like failing a monthly urine test for drugs.
The 3.4 percent increase in inmates in state and federal prisons in 1999 -- to 1.37 million -- was well below the average annual growth rate during the 1990's, of 6.5 percent, the new report said. The growth rate hit a high of 8.7 percent in 1994, well after the crime wave of the late 1980's and early 1990's began to decline in 1991, falling gradually for the rest of the decade.
There are 690 prisoners per 100,000 United States residents, according to The Sentencing Project, a nonprofit prison research and advocacy organization in Washington. That rate is six times that of Canada and Australia, which are both around 110 prisoners per 100,000 residents, the project said, and five times that of any country in the European Union.
One major issue that the Justice Department's study did not address was whether there was any relationship between growth in the incarceration rate and the drop in crime. Advocates of tougher prosecution and sentencing say the huge growth in imprisonment, with the incarceration rate quadrupling since 1980, has been largely responsible for the decrease in crime.
But Professor Blumstein said crime rates were also going up sharply in the late 1980's when prison population was increasing as well. Some other factors that must also be considered, he said, were the improved economy in the 1990's, better police tactics and the waning of the crack cocaine epidemic.

HEADLINE: AT THE MOVIES;
Cable Offshoot Branches Out

BYLINE: By Dave Kehr

 BODY:
As the new digital technologies continue to transform the movie business, established companies are looking for ways to protect their franchise while taking advantage of new opportunities. One example is IFC Films, an offshoot of the Independent Film Channel cable network, which was itself an offshoot of Bravo, the upscale cultural channel that started up in 1980.
Under the direction of Jonathan Sehring, the president of IFC Films, and Caroline Kaplan, the vice president for production and development, the company has branched out from creating programs for its parent network into producing full-length features for theatrical distribution. 
 With IFC's "Boys Don't Cry" winning an Oscar for the actress Hilary Swank and "Girlfight," a drama about a female boxer from Brooklyn, poised to become the indie hit of the fall season, it's been a good year for Mr. Sehring and Ms. Kaplan.
But they aren't resting on their laurels. They've just sprung another offshoot, teaming with the producers Gary Winick and John Sloss to create Independent Digital Entertainment, a k a InDigEnt.
"Right now it's five movies," Mr. Sehring said, "but it's going to be an ongoing series of movies done by filmmakers with pretty good casts, inspired by Dogma 95, but with a New York slant."
Dogma 95 is the semiserious movement spawned by the Danish filmmaker Lars von Trier as a reaction against Hollywood inflation. The idea is to make digital video films quickly and cheaply, without recourse to fancy lighting, special effects or music. "We don't have the Dogma rules, other than the budget, which initially was to make 10 films for $100,000 each," Mr. Sehring said. "So for a million dollars we'll have a whole slate."
"Half of the revenue, from the first dollar, goes to the creative talent," he said, a radical departure from Hollywood accounting practices. "So a lot of pretty well-known actors, directors and writers are working for scale, because they're sharing revenue from the outset."
The initial projects are "Final," directed by Campbell Scott and starring Denis Leary and Hope Davis, and Ethan Hawke's "Last Word on Paradise," with Uma Thurman and Kevin Corrigan. "We're not into making made-for-cable movies," Mr. Sehring said. "When we make a movie, we want it to go out theatrically and we want it to go to pay television. We get the cable window after it runs on pay TV and we get the library rights."
Non-InDigEnt projects for the next year include "Waking Life," an animated feature directed by Richard Linklater ("Slacker"), and "Monsoon Wedding," a new film by Mira Nair ("Salaam Bombay!") currently shooting in India. "The one thing we are steadfast about is not having any creative control over a project," Mr. Sehring said, "which is why we've had a lot of world-class filmmakers come to work with us, from John Sayles and Steven Soderbergh early, to Rick and Mira now.
"We're involved when they want us to be involved, and if they don't want us, we stay away. Rick sometimes feels it's a bit disconcerting because he hasn't heard from us. He'll call in and say, 'Don't you want to know what's going on?' and we're like, 'Yeah, whenever you want to tell us.' We told you we'd leave you alone, and we're leaving you alone."
 
Donal Who?
When Donal Logue won the best actor award at January's Sundance Film Festival, for playing Dex, a pudgy Don Juan in Jenniphr Goodman's "Tao of Steve," he was hailed as a gifted newcomer -- an ambiguous compliment for this character actor who has appeared in almost 40 features since 1989.
"I remember people at Sundance asking, 'Is this your first movie?' " said Mr. Logue on a recent New York visit. "And I thought, that's cool. It's weird that you can work so much for 10 years and support yourself and get around and not appear on the radar anywhere. But then the times I did appear on the radar, I played parts so different from each other that people didn't put together that I was the same guy. And that's cool, too.
"I'm completely into that element of being unrecognizable to some degree from part to part to part. Like Jimmy, this weird cab driver guy that I did on MTV, to the gay cancer guy in 'The Band Played On,' to the vampire in 'Blade' whose hand gets cut off, to Dex in 'The Tao of Steve.' "
Mr. Logue, in fact, can currently be seen in three movies on New York screens: "Steve," for which he received warm reviews; "The Patriot," in which he has a supporting role (a Southern soldier who overcomes his racism); and "The Opportunists," a hangdog heist comedy opening today that finds Mr. Logue as a not-so-sharp security guard (review, Page 13).
"All of us want to hit the homer," Mr. Logue said. "But movies are sometimes made in the trenches, by the guys in the smaller parts. And sometimes you have more freedom, because you have less to carry so you can do wilder stuff. But at the same time I'm glad, now that I've had my chance to carry a movie, that people would respect it."

Speaking of "The Opportunists," the film is the work of Myles Connell, a 36-year-old Dublin native who now lives in Greenpoint section of Brooklyn. The film, on one level, is an ironic fable about immigration and the American dream. Its central character is Michael, a young Irishman (Peter McDonald) who turns up on the of his long-lost cousin Vic (Christopher Walken) in Sunnyside, Queens. Michael expects to find a prosperous businessman; instead he finds a safecracker on parole. Not to be dissuaded from his dream of riches, Michael pressures Vic into undertaking one last job.
"You see so many New York crime movies that are just fast cars and guns and people lying in pools of blood, and I just wanted to do something different, that was based more around a character who was just trying to make a go of it," Mr. Connell said.
"Vic to Michael is a little bit of a metaphor for his relationship to coming to America. For people who come here from different places, there's much more opportunity to get an education and so on here. You come to appreciate the things you get here that maybe you don't get at home. Michael is much more devious, but there's something of me in him.
"The old immigrant neighborhoods, and the way people stay for a generation or two and then disperse out into the rest of the country, were fascinating to me," Mr. Connell said. "I wanted to create, out of those neighborhoods, a sense of a village. I showed the movie in France, and a critic there said he thought it was a very bucolic film. I took it as a compliment."

In Their Own Worlds: Giant Hybrids of Fact and Fantasy

BYLINE: By ROBERTA SMITH

DATELINE: NORTH ADAMS, Mass., Aug. 4

 BODY:
"Unnatural Science" at the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art is a well-done exhibition. The first serious theme show to be organized in the vaulting refurbished factory spaces of Mass MOCA, which opened to the public last year, it is thoughtfully installed, coherent yet diverse, and presents most of its participants to good advantage.
It also has an eminently topical theme, given the computer-generated nature of almost everything, the regular advances in science and medicine, the constant refinements in digital imaging and the arrival of the genome era. Science and its technologies press in on us from all sides, and artists are bound to use them, adapting, mimicking, distorting and commenting upon them as they see fit. 
 The only thing missing is staying power. Too many of the artworks in this show stick to familiar strategies or are little more than elaborate, often beautifully executed illustrations of some scientific fact or fantasy. In one work, for example, it is possible to watch hundreds of little flags flutter in exactly the same speed and direction as the winds outside the building -- the kind of effect that looks great in a science museum or, even better, across wavy fields of grain. The show provides very few experiences that don't evaporate almost before you vacate Mass MOCA's handsomely renovated premises.
The sight of artists grappling with intractable materials or difficult thought is relatively rare here. The beautiful, abstruse paintings of Matthew Ritchie, with their meldings of creation myth, Big Bang theory and polytheism, offer some resistance, and also provide one of the show's few moments of color. (Catherine Chalmers's big color photographs of insects and reptiles instinctually enacting the food chain in action provide the other.)
But too often the show is about art for consumption's sake, works whose meanings are completely available either visually or with the help of an explanatory brochure. As with so many big shows lately, one begins to suspect that the museum theme show, once the litmus test of curatorial talent, is morphing into a no-brainer, and that art is doing its bit to help.
In these post-Conceptual times, when art is so overtly involved with narrative and subject matter reigns, it's getting easier and easier to come up with catchy, accessible, viewer-friendly art links -- art and fashion, film, religion or history. Add to this the institutionalization of Conceptual-oriented installation art and the ever-larger museum spaces being built to accommodate it. The result is festivalism, as Peter Schjeldahl aptly put it in The New Yorker last summer: big shows that present a succession of big, encompassing artworks quarantined in separate galleries, so that the viewer moves from one discrete experience of total immersion to the next.
"Unnatural Science" is a case of mini-festivalism. It contains only 14 works by 15 artists, but each has been given quantities of space and is seen pretty much in isolation. And each provides an "experience."
So it's telling to simply walk through this show and notice which experience holds your attention and which doesn't. There is plenty that is handsome and momentarily engaging. Gary Schneider's "Genetic Self-Portrait," with its greatly magnified black-and-white images of such details as a strand of the artist's hair or his DNA have a strange deathliness considering their extreme focus on life. In "Apparatus for the Distillation of Vague Intuitions," Eve Andree Laramee takes her usual chem-lab sculptures to mad-scientist extremes, covering two large tables with towering transparent edifices of glass beakers and coiling tubes, although there's a strong resemblance to an elegant window display.
And clearly intended as the exhibition's showstopper is Tim Hawkinson's "Uberorgan," which fills Mass MOCA's largest, football-field-size gallery with a dozen white plastic bladder-shaped balloons the size of small whales. Equipped with big telescoping horns made of cardboard and aluminum foil and triggered by a device similar to a player-piano roll, the balloons function as bagpipes, bleating out the notes of four Christian hymns in very low octaves. The economy of filling such a large space with so much sound and form using a relatively small amount of material is impressive. "Uberorgan" is definitely an experience, but the most lasting impression, as is usual with this artist, is one of boyish genius and industriousness.
There are numerous opportunities for total immersion here, but little that you dip into feels very new, unless you use narrative as the yardstick. Repeatedly generic visual strategies are used to convey less familiar subject matter -- that is, the words change, but the tunes don't.
Thus Michael Oatman's "Long Shadows: Henry Perkins and the Eugenics Survey of Vermont (Vermont Pure)" partakes of the lengthening tradition of the walk-in diorama re creation as practiced by Ilya Kabokov, Mark Dion, Barbara Bloom and other artists. Mr. Oatman, who has worked in the diorama format himself since the early 1990's, has assembled here the half-real, half-imagined office of Perkins -- the first director of the Robert Hull Fleming Museum of the University of Vermont -- whose zoological training found perverse expression in the racist pseudo-science of eugenics that sought to weed out "undesirable" genetic traits through sterilization.
The display is fastidiously detailed and fascinatingly creepy -- a kind of walk-in history lesson -- but its most powerful element is simple: a videotape of an actor giving a lecture whose racist ideas are drawn from Perkins's letters and eugenics propaganda. In one of the installation's many unnecessary touches, it is projected on a painting of a landscape.
Similarly, Lim Young-sun's "Room of the Host," adds capably but unexceptionally to the ever-expanding installation-art tradition of the darkened room in which the viewer is surrounded by mysterious lighted objects and strange sounds. (Practitioners of this genre range from regulars like Tatsuo Miyajima to one-time users like Serge Spitzer, who created an unaccountable stir at last year's Venice Biennale by lining up empty glasses in a huge darkened shed.) In this case the objects are small jars containing green fluid and little specimenlike resin casts that suggest skulls, bones, vertebrae and jellyfish that hang from the ceiling. Thomas Grunfeld's 1994 "Misfit (St. Bernhard)," a stuffed dog with a sheep's face, staves off complete Surrealist hokiness with a weird, saintly serenity, but may also have contributed to the craze for anatomically incorrect taxidermical jokes that currently afflicts sculpture.
The most impressive works in the show are two old standards. One is Peter Fischli and David Weiss's 30-minute 1987 film classic, "Der Lauf der Dinge" ("The Way Things Go"). A seemingly uninterrupted domino effect of chain reactions involving oozing foam, pendulums, balances, inclined planes, rolling objects of all kinds and occasional fireworks, it creates an effect of 70's Process Art in perpetual motion. Equally good is Steina Vasulka's 1993 video installation "Borealis," which captures the uncontrollable power of nature in constantly moving, spatially disorienting images of roaring water, breaking waves and moist, loudly crunching undergrowth. Ms. Vasulka's aggressive manipulation of her medium matches her subject. The wildness of nature, the weirdness of video and the susceptibility of human perception play a hallucinatory game of tag here, and the viewer struggles to keep up.
But these works are among the exceptions in an exhibition that suggests -- as Donald Judd once said of 80's painting -- that theme shows are becoming a form of musical comedy. The analogy conjures up not only the endless recycling of familiar conventions -- which I think was Judd's meaning -- but also a sequence of more or less pleasant entertainments in which each player executes a song-and-dance routine that works well with the other numbers and then exits gracefully, clearing the stage for the next performer.
 
"Unnatural Science" remains at the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art, 87 Marshall Street, North Adams, Mass., (413) 664-4481, through April 15. Information online: www.massmoca.org.

Decrease in Petroleum Costs Kept July Import Prices Level

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 10

 BODY:
Prices of imported goods were unchanged in July as a decline in the cost of petroleum offset increases for autos and some raw materials, government figures showed today.
The steady import prices last month came after a 1.2 percent increase in June, the Labor Department said. Excluding petroleum, import costs rose 0.3 percent after an increase of 0.1 percent in June. 
 Falling import costs have helped keep inflation in check in recent years as companies paid less for raw materials and were unable to raise their prices when faced with international competition. That began to change in recent months, especially as rising oil costs began to feed through into the cost of other goods and services.
Compared with July 1999, import prices were 6.7 percent higher last month. Excluding oil, however, the year-over-year increase was just 1.6 percent. While that was the largest such increase since January 1996, import prices excluding fuel are still rising at a slower pace than they did the first five years of the nine-year-old economic expansion.
Federal Reserve policy makers will meet on Aug. 22, and some of them have signaled that they will hold the line on interest rates. The pace of inflation, excluding the effect of higher energy prices, is "pretty tame" and consumer spending is slowing, Robert Parry, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said today.
And though the economy may be cooling, jobs remain plentiful. A separate Labor Department report showed the four-week average for first-time claims for state unemployment benefits fell to 288,500 last week from 295,250 in the previous week. The four-week average was the lowest since the last week of May. For the week, claims rose 18,000, to a level of 293,000.

Ambivalence in China On Expanding Net Access

BYLINE: By CRAIG S. SMITH 

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, Aug. 10

 BODY:
China's unease with the Internet is growing as the country embraces the new medium to modernize its economy yet worries about the Web's spread beyond government control.
Just this week, the government-sponsored State Research Information Technology Company said it had hired a California company to help set up electronic commerce sites for thousands of government companies. And it claims to own China's first patented Wireless Application Protocol system, which could greatly expand Internet access in a country where cellular telephones vastly outnumber personal computers. 
 But even as the government pushes its own Internet ventures, it is trying to stamp out others that it sees as a potential political threat.
"Enemy forces at home and abroad are sparing no effort to use this battlefront to infiltrate us," said an editorial this week in the Communist Party's national newspaper, The People's Daily.
The warning followed renewed reports that local governments are establishing Internet surveillance units and tracking down people who use the Web to express political dissent or other nonconformist ideas. The government shut one such Web site, www.xinwenming.com, this week for posting "counterrevolutionary content," a euphemism that often means nothing more than criticism of the government. Police are searching for the Web site's organizers, according to the New York-based Human Rights in China group.
The government's deep ambivalence toward the Internet, which Beijing fears could be used to unite opposition to the Communist Party, has slowed the medium's development here. And it threatens to distort the new industry in much the way the planned economy distorted other industries in the past, favoring inefficient government-owned ventures over more creative private ones.
Already, the government's heavy hand has cast a pall over private Web ventures, which are relying on foreign investment to survive.
Regulations that make much of the foreign investment technically illegal and the inability of Internet companies to list their shares on China's stock market are scaring off venture capitalists who were still pumping money into the sector just a few weeks ago. Many of the tiny Internet companies started in the last year are running out of cash and closing.
Internet entrepreneurs say government interference has cost the industry hundreds of millions of dollars in investment capital that could have helped close the gap with the Internet of the West.
Had Beijing moved more quickly, the critics say, many Chinese Internet companies could have listed their shares on Nasdaq before that market tumbled in April and the American public's appetite for Internet plays waned.
Instead, Beijing dithered and by the time it began allowing Chinese companies to list abroad, the moment had passed. The shares of the last two Chinese Internet companies to list on Nasdaq, Netease.com and Sohu.com, are trading at about half of their initial offering prices. Other Chinese Internet stock offerings have been postponed.
China's state-owned ventures, meanwhile, are failing to generate much excitement among the venture capital community that has watched the Internet develop elsewhere.
"Many of the government initiatives which don't have a strong involvement with the private sector do face the risk of failure," said David Williams, a Hong Kong-based partner at the American venture capital firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson.
Despite its threatening talk and a few widely publicized arrests, Beijing appears to be failing in its efforts to control unauthorized information flows. The government estimates that 17 million people are connected to the Internet, and that number is doubling every six months while numerous Web sites are popping up each day.
For example, one popular Web site, www.homeway.com, which regularly posts unconfirmed news reports from the Hong Kong press, had reported for weeks that Li Jizhou, vice minister of public security, was in Beijing's Qincheng Prison awaiting trial for taking bribes worth millions of dollars. And the Web site of the Internet advocate Huang Qi, www.6-4tianwang.com, remains up, despite the arrest of Mr. Huang. He is facing charges of subversion after posting information about the 1989 massacre that ended pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square.

HEADLINE: Legislatures Of the World Call Congress 'The Rudest'

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Aug. 10

 BODY:
More than 170 speakers of legislatures around the world plan to meet here for the first time later this month to celebrate a little-noticed byproduct of the spread of democracy: the growth and strengthening of national parliaments.
To the chagrin of the organizers, however, no one from the United States Congress seems willing to attend. 
 Since 1996, the Republican-led Congress has failed to pay its dues to the group that organized the meeting, the Inter-Parliamentary Union, which Americans helped to found in 1889. An invitation to preside over part of the meeting was sent to J. Dennis Hastert, the Illinois Republican who is speaker of the House of Representatives. It has not been answered. No one can make it from the Senate side either, officials of the Inter-Parliamentary Union said.
"I think that they should be there," said Anders B. Johnsson, a Swede who is secretary general of the group. "I think the world wants them to be there. We've sent that message. But we haven't got a response. I think that's a shame."
Mr. Johnsson, an administrator based in Geneva, and Najma Heptullah, the speaker of India's upper house, who is now president of the parliamentary union, both tried to meet American legislators to persuade them to attend the meeting and play a part in strengthening the work of national legislatures. Ms. Heptullah waited in vain in New York for two weeks for an appointment with Mr. Hastert in Washington, union officials said.
An official on Mr. Johnsson's staff, frustrated by repeated snubs from Washington, called Congress "the rudest parliament in the world, without a doubt." He described the atmosphere on Capitol Hill as fortresslike and "run by aides who are the age of my children."
In Washington, John Feehery, the House speaker's spokesman, said that Mr. Hastert could not attend the meeting because he would be traveling in Colombia with President Clinton at the end of August. "This is the worst time of the year for us, toward the end of the August recess," he said. "This is a very contentious political year, and the speaker is going to be spending most of his time campaigning."
If Congress does not resume paying its dues, about $900,000 a year, it will be suspended from the Inter-Parliamentary Union in October and expelled next year, oddly, at a meeting scheduled to be held in Havana.
National legislatures have growing roles to play in a global age, parliamentary union officials and members say. Legislatures have the power to regulate the uses of national resources, and protect countries from exploitation in an era of economic globalization. They ratify treaties and debate international policies. Domestically, they can protect rights, raise tax revenues and guide social policies so that spending reaches the poor. Functioning legislatures aid development.
When Secretary General Kofi Annan travels abroad, said Santiago Romero-Perez, director of the Inter-Parliamentary Union's liaison office with the United Nations, "he makes it a point of visiting parliaments."
"This is not a chance happening," Mr. Romero added, "but a realization that the big commitments made during the 1990's really need a popular response. Parliaments have to legislate and appropriate the funds."
In Geneva, Mr. Johnsson said that many parliaments still needed work.
"If you look at the last decade -- the 1990's, the one that history will remember as a period of democratization in the world -- one country out of every four in the world changed its constitutional framework, its electoral law, its parliament." he said. "In all of those, there were two elements in common. One is that they introduced multiparty systems, and the other was that they introduced a stronger parliament with real legislative and oversight functions."
National parliaments, he said, are a natural link between the grass roots and the wider world, including the international economic institutions that have become targets of criticism in the third world.
"Many people in many parts of the world feel that they are completely disconnected from the real decision-making processes on the international scene," Mr. Johnsson said. "That is a great concern. If they don't feel that these are their processes and that they have an influence over them, then these processes may be destroyed. That we cannot afford."

Two Big Online Toy Sellers to Merge Units

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
Toys "R" Us and Amazon.com said yesterday that they were merging their online toy-sales units, an acknowledgment that selling toys on the Internet has been too hard for each of them alone.
Starting later this year, toysrus .com will direct users to a toy section of Amazon.com. Customers will be able to use their Amazon accounts to buy toys, books, tools and other merchandise in a single order that will be shipped in one box. 
 But Amazon's role will shift from being a store proprietor to being something more like a mall owner. Toys "R" Us will buy the inventory, set the prices, write the item descriptions and get credit for the revenue and any potential profits or losses. Toys "R" Us will pay Amazon to use its Internet site and to house the merchandise in its warehouses.
"This allows both of us to reach profitability in our toy businesses significantly sooner than we would have been able to," said Jeffrey P. Bezos, chief executive of Amazon.
The deal also helps each company avoid the more troubling aspects of its toy business.
Last Christmas season, Toys "R" Us was hit by myriad operating problems, from crashes on its Web site to an inability to deliver toys when promised. Amazon was able to satisfy customers, but did so at a big cost. It had ordered so many toys that it had to take a $39 million writedown on its unsold inventory, a huge number relative to its total sales of toys and children's merchandise of $95 million in the fourth quarter of last year.
Amazon has found toys a more difficult business than books and records. They are big and expensive to ship. They must be ordered, largely from Asia, six months ahead of time, forcing a retailer to predict children's whims. And unlike books, unwanted toys cannot be returned to manufacturers for credit.
Toys "R" Us will sell its three distribution centers, which analysts estimate it had spent $50 million to build. And Amazon will sell Toys "R" Us its inventory of toys. Neither company would say if a charge would be taken to cover those costs.
"We are getting better, but they are three years ahead of us and we would never catch up," said John Eyler, chief executive of Toys "R" Us.
Analysts praised Amazon for getting out of a tough business.
"They capitulated," said Lauren Levitan, with Robertson Stevens. "They needed to do something to mitigate their inventory risk and create a more predictable business for themselves."
The move is not without a cost to Amazon's image. "I am struck by the irony of the visionary poster boy for the new economy being mated with the poster child of eroding retail brands," Ms. Levitan said.
Peter Caruso, a retail analyst with Merrill Lynch, said the highlight of the deal was that the market for Toys "R" Us might not be eroding as fast as some had feared.
"This tells you the success Amazon had in books is not going to be repeated in other areas, and the Internet toy market is not going to be as large as everyone thought," he said. "That means that Toys 'R' Us is not going to be vulnerable sitting there with all those stores."
This vision of the toy market is vastly different from a year ago, when half a dozen companies were preparing to spend an estimated $200 million to promote online toy stores. Christmas proved to be a Waterloo for many of them, in fact. Toysmart, an online store backed by Walt Disney, failed, as did Red Rocket, a toy store owned by Viacom. And KBKids.com, controlled by KB Toys, the No. 2 store chain, has abandoned its plan for a public offering and has laid off 30 percent of its work force.
"This is great news for us," said Toby Lenk, the chief executive of eToys, the No. 1 online toy store. "Last year we had half a dozen competitors. Now our two remaining competitors are merging into one."
Mr. Lenk said he expected the steep price cutting of last year to be far less severe this Christmas. "A lot of the players doing the insane discounting are just not here anymore," he said.
Investors, however, were largely unmoved by the deal. Shares in Toys "R" Us closed unchanged at $17.375. Amazon shares slipped 43.75 cents, to $30.4375. Etoys dropped 9 cents, to $3.9375.
Under the arrangement with Amazon, online customers will no longer be able to return toys to stores, as Toys "R" Us customers have been able to do. Conversely, though, most will no longer have to pay sales tax.

HEADLINE: Soft, Cute and New on the Farm;
Far From Andes, Alpacas Turn Heads and Even Profits

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS 

DATELINE: BETHEL, N.Y.

 BODY:
Screech. Slam. Ooh. Ahh.
Edward F. Boyd and his family scarcely notice the noise anymore. They know the routine so well. First, there is the sudden glow of the brake lights on the vehicles heading past their 120-acre farm on a normally quiet back road in rural Sullivan County. Then comes the whine of the brakes and the thump of car doors slamming. Inevitably, a knot of curious visitors gathers at the pasture fence near the 200-year-old house. 
 "A lot of them take out cameras," said Mr. Boyd, "because they've never seen an alpaca before."
He was referring to the 80 quizzical, friendly looking, big-eyed creatures eyeing him meditatively on a recent afternoon, all of them sporting improbably long eyelashes and goofy topknots. Each resembled nothing so much as a teddy-bear-ish Bambi as drawn by Dr. Seuss.
Until very recently the alpaca was an exotic sight at county fairs and petting zoos in the metropolitan region. And the animals were profoundly unknown way out there in rustic crevices like Mr. Boyd's 120-acre former dairy spread, half a mile from what was once the site of the original Woodstock festival.
For a tiny but growing number of upstate farmers and entrepreneurs, however, these gentle, adaptable creatures are becoming not just a curiosity but a way of life: an avocation, a passionate cause and, more importantly, a profit center.
Officials in Sullivan County and the region see the alpaca farms, should their numbers grow, not only as a support to the local economy, but as an alternative to the exurban encroachment that is implacably transforming picturesque dairy farms into split-level tracts. "Alpacas are well suited to the land here," said Allan C. Scott, supervisor of the Town of Bethel, the largest in the county. "It's already a good thing for our economy, and I'm sure that raising alpacas could be an economic option for others in Sullivan County."
One of those others is Maria Herlinda Bravo, an entrepreneur who has established a herd of 340 alpacas on a 48-acre farm in Callicoon, N.Y., six miles northwest of Mr. Boyd.
"Alpacas thrive in the warm days and cool nights here," said Ms. Bravo, a former grocery-chain vice president, who in 1999 made her farm the headquarters of a vertically integrated international alpaca operation. She breeds the animals and shears the luxurious fleece for her fashion business, selling expensive scarves, sweaters, blankets and blouses through a catalog and on the Internet, under the name of Quintessence and Company.
Apart from Mr. Boyd and Ms. Bravo, alpaca herds have recently been established in Catskill, New Kingston and Walton. There are other New York herds in Hancock and Rome, and alpacas are being raised on Long Island and in Connecticut.
Mr. Boyd's son Brandon is president of the Mid-Atlantic Alpaca Association, which counts as its members 100 of the 140 alpaca owners in seven mid-Atlantic states (they are given to flaunting vehicle bumper stickers proclaiming "ALPACAS -- HAVE YOU HERD?").
But still: alpacas?
While some raise the animals as pets, the real draw is the silky, durable, water-resistant and highly insulative alpaca fleece, which has long been prized as the raw material for luxurious fabric.
Breeders say that depending on the color and the quality, fleece sells for $2 to $8 per ounce in the United States, primarily to artisanal weavers and knitters. Each animal produces five to eight pounds of fleece per year, enough for several sweaters.
While it can be lucrative to sell, alpaca can be even more lucrative to weave: a man's sweater can be made out of one pound of yarn worth about $40; it costs $100 in labor to weave, and can be sold for $400.
But Mr. Boyd and other herd owners breed alpacas for more than fleece: females sell for $12,500 to $40,000, and herd sires have fetched as much as $165,000. Owners command stud fees of $2,000 to $5,000 for their prize bulls.
These days 99 percent of the world's three million alpacas graze in the mountains of Bolivia, Chile and Peru. But in recent years, herds have been established in Canada, Australia, Japan, Britain, Israel, Italy and other countries.
In the United States, alpacas are being raised in every state, and the nation's alpaca herd is growing by about 22 percent a year, according to the Alpaca Registry in Kalispell, Mont. By July 31, there were 29,856 registered alpacas, up 2,145 percent over 1990, when there were 1,330. The number of owners has grown from 146, in 1991, to 2,919.
"We expect the number to double in another five years," said Ken Hobert, business manager of the Alpaca Owners and Breeders Association in Estes Park, Colo., which has 1,950 members. "We get 1,000 inquiries a month from people who want to know more about owning alpacas," he said of the registry's Web site, www.alpacainfo.com.
He said the scarcity of alpacas is based on their slow rate of reproduction, since females usually deliver one baby, called a cria, per year. Importing alpacas from South America is difficult and expensive, given quarantine restrictions, and the Alpaca Registry has been closed to newly imported alpacas since Dec. 31, 1998. Unregistered alpacas "have minimal breeding value, and are difficult to sell," Mr. Boyd said.
Eager to show off the superiority of their fleece, alpaca worshipers proffer research showing that alpaca fibers are stronger, lighter, warmer and softer than sheep's wool. Studies show that the semi-hollow alpaca fibers are finer than Angora rabbit fleece, mohair (from Angora goats) and cashmere goat fleece.
And unlike merino (sheep's wool), alpaca fleece is lanolin-free, and sold, therefore, to those who are allergic to wool.
Beyond this, breeders say alpacas are, in livestock patois, easy keepers, requiring minimal food, water, care and shelter, thanks to the extremes of heat and cold their ancestors endured in the Andes. They live 15 to 25 years and can weigh 150 to 175 pounds.
They are placid, have no incisors, horns, hooves or claws, and "they don't bite and they rarely kick, and when they do, they don't hurt each other -- because they have soft pads on their feet," said Mr. Boyd's farm manager, Jair Trujillo. "They don't cut up the pasture, either."
For these and other reasons, alpaca owners reject comparisons with the ostrich-farm scramble of the 1980's, when speculators expected windfall profits from the supposedly exploding ostrich market only to find that it was more of a novelty boomlet. "Ostriches are mean, dangerous and dirty," contended Mr. Boyd, "and they are nowhere as easy to handle as alpacas."
Ms. Bravo estimates that, given the slow alpaca reproductive rate, "it will take a long time to drive the price of breeding stock down."
She has placed a big bet on Sullivan County by putting in new buildings and paddocks to house her high-tech computer-monitored alpaca business, which employs six full-time workers, and features a two-story barn-cum-office-cum-laboratory equipped with ultrasound devices to monitor gestating alpaca females.
The hope for stability in alpaca prices is an important consideration in Sullivan County, where, because of low milk prices, more farms "are being lost every year," said Mr. Scott, a director of the Sullivan County Partnership, a consortium of organizations working to develop the county's economy.
Mr. Boyd, an alpaca proselytizer, said he welcomed competition. "There is plenty of room for more," said Mr. Boyd, a retired marketing manager for the Pepsi-Cola Company and American Home Products Corporation.
Mr. Boyd, 86, bought the farm in 1966, a decade after it supported dairy cows, "but I always wanted to use the property productively," he said. He finally got his wish in 1994 after seeing a televised report about an alpaca herd in Santa Fe, N.M. "I knew how to spell alpaca but didn't know any more than that."
He added, laughing, "Some people thought I had a soft cranium, but I saw the potential from the start." He suggested the alpaca avocation to his wife and four grown children. "After Dad suggested we buy them, we just looked at each other," recalled his 44-year-old son, Brandon, an entertainment lawyer in Manhattan. "Then we said: 'What is this? Can you eat them? Do they pull a plow?' Finally we thought, 'Maybe it will help to keep Dad busy.' "
In 1994 the senior Mr. Boyd bought his first three animals for $55,500, soon bought seven more, and found himself the proprietor of the Double E Alpaca Farm (the E's represent Ed Boyd and his wife, Edith).
As his herd increased, he began selling fleece to local spinners, and soon was selling animals and obtaining stud fees. "I started with a five-year plan, to make money, and we made it," said Mr. Boyd, adding that his alpacas were profitable for the first time in 1999, earning $50,000.
Along the way, Brandon Boyd said that he was converted. "There was just something about them that drew me in," he said. As he spoke, he stood near his father in the venerable dairy barn, where a throng of alpacas made the sound called "humming": a soothing ululation that sounds something like a happy kazoo.
"They are such gentle animals," Brandon said. "All I can say is that I've really become very gung-ho about alpacas."

HEADLINE: Tire Technology Has Bred Consistency and Compatibility

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
No one yet knows what caused a disproportionate number of Firestone tires to fail on Ford Explorers, or why many of the failed tires seem to have come from one Firestone plant in Decatur, Ill. But when it comes to tire design, manufacture and composition in general, experts are unanimous about one thing: Tires on the road today are safe, when they are used as intended.
"The general reason for tire failure is tire abuse by drivers, not tire manufacture," said Edward J. Wagner, a consultant in Louisville, Ky., who often serves as an expert witness -- both for and against tire companies -- in product liability lawsuits. Among other mistakes, consumers let their tires get low on air, or put the wrong size of tires on their vehicles. 
 In November, Consumer Reports studied six all-weather tires for sport utility vehicles -- none of them made by Firestone. It checked how well they braked, took corners, held the road in snow or rain and otherwise performed. "We've found no tires with dangerous performance attributes," said R. David Pittle, technical director of Consumer Reports. Even the lowest-ranked tire -- a Goodyear Wrangler RAF -- "ranked in the middle of good," he said.
That was not always the case, of course. When radial tires were introduced in the United States in the late 1970's, they brought their share of problems. Most were reinforced with fiberglass, which often broke. And many had sidewalls that bulged out, causing bumpy rides. One early radial, the Firestone 500, leaked air, making it the subject of one of the largest tire recalls in history.
Now, all tire manufacturers use durable steel belts. And most tires are made of sophisticated rubber compounds that can withstand heat and friction. "You almost can't buy a bad tire these days," said Robert Ulrich, editor of Modern Tire Dealer.
No one is suggesting that tires are commodities, differentiated only by advertising. Indeed, they are highly engineered products, with each company keeping its particular curing temperature, tread design and cocktail of rubber compounds a closely held trade secret.
Tires can be made up of as many as 200 different materials, from rubbers to plastics to steel, amalgamated into more than 30 components. Some parts, like the tread or sidewall, are visible. Others, like the steel belts for reinforcement, or the butyl rubber interliners to keep air from leaking, are on the inside. There are layers, called plies, of polyester, rayon and other materials. Most tires have high-tensile steel wires, called beads, that keep tires seated against the metal wheels.
Each line of tires has a slightly different tread designed for hugging the road better in wet weather, but all of them operate loosely on the principle that the placement or depth of grooves on the tire can keep the tire from accumulating water and hydroplaning. Similarly, manufacturers tinker with the makeup of rubber compounds to increase traction, and redesign treads to give a quieter ride.
Every tire represents tradeoffs. Put in a lot of carbon black to make the tire more resistant to cuts and it may have traction problems on wet pavements. Add silica to reduce resistance -- and thus increase fuel economy -- and there can be a static electricity buildup that causes a mild shock if you touch the car.
In Europe, some tire manufacturers have added extra nylon reinforcement to make tires more durable. Joan Claybrook, director of Public Citizen, the consumer rights group, has frequently suggested that American tire manufacturers do the same. But most American tire experts say the nylon does not add anything to tire performance.
But for the most part -- ad campaigns to the contrary -- tires are compatible, making it possible for consumers to replace one tire at a time with whatever brand they prefer.
All tires are manufactured to specifications laid out by the Tire and Rim Association, a trade group that decides the minimum and maximum amount of air the tire should hold and the size of car or load it should carry. The "DOT" stamp that appears on tires is a Department of Transportation certification that the tires conform to the association's standards and have passed its tests for resistance to puncture, endurance, stability and such.
"Every manufacturer makes their tires compatible expressly so consumers can move between Brand A and Brand B and Brand C," said William M. Hopkins, Goodyear's vice president for technical planning.
There have been cases of companies voluntarily recalling tires because the beads were cracking, or for other structural problems. But Marvin Bozarth, executive director of the International Tire and Rubber Association, says the vast majority of the recalls over the last 20 years were of tires that had been inadvertently mislabeled, not tires that had performed badly.
"There are small differences among tires, but there are no big differences," he said.

HEADLINE: The Long, Costly Encore

 BODY:
Al Gore has got to be thinking "Get the hook." After all, Los Angeles is a show-business town, and Democrats from across the country are heading there for what is supposed to be Vice President Gore's show. But President and Mrs. Clinton are blatantly hogging the spotlight from Saturday until next Tuesday. As has so often been the case in the Clinton administration, the thirst for campaign money and other donations seems to be overriding both good manners and political prudence. The bottom line is that Mr. Gore does not get to be the star of his own show until it is half over, and by that time the Clintons will have decamped with millions of Democratic dollars.
By comparison, the last baton-passing by a two-term president was a model of grace and consideration. In 1988 Ronald Reagan zipped into New Orleans for 48 hours on a schedule adjusted to his vice president's political needs. Mr. Reagan gave one speech denouncing the Democrats and another asserting that George Bush was ready to lead, made a joint appearance with Mr. Bush at the airport and then winged off toward California. 
 The Clintons are heading for the Golden State too, but for them it is beach party time. A Saturday concert is supposed to raise $4 million for Hillary Rodham Clinton's Senate campaign. At Barbra Streisand's place in Malibu on Sunday, Mr. Clinton is expected to pull in $10 million for his presidential library.
It would be hard work to raise that kind of money later on for a facility in Arkansas, and that probably explains the president's willingness to compete with Mr. Gore for time and top billing among wealthy donors at the convention. But the president's insistent star turn misserves Mr. Gore in a way that goes beyond the financial. At this point in the campaign, the vice president needs to be seen as an independent force rather than a second banana who cannot even dictate the schedule of his own convention.
This competition for attention between two supposedly best buddies creates an odd setting for Mr. Clinton's speech to the convention on Monday. Will it be a full-throated campaign speech for Mr. Gore as a leader who deserves to be president in his own right and on his own merits? Or will it be Mr. Clinton's valedictory reminder that he created an economic boom that Mr. Gore is lucky to be running on?
As a historic footnote, it should be noted that Ronald Reagan wanted a third term too. But he didn't use his vice president's convention to remind everyone of that fact.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE AD CAMPAIGN;
A Union-Created Group Attacks Bush on Health Care Issues

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

 BODY:
The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, through a group it created called American Family Voices, has joined the political advertising wars with a 30-second television spot titled "Invest." The advertisement takes George W. Bush to task for several decisions he has made as governor of Texas and tries to link them to large contributions to him and the Republican Party from the insurance, nursing home and drug industries. The slickly produced advertisement does not urge viewers to vote against Mr. Bush or for Vice President Al Gore, but asks them to call Mr. Bush's office or visit the sponsoring group's Web site. 

PRODUCER -- Axelrod & Associates.
ON THE SCREEN -- A hand-held camera pans the confetti-strewn floor of a darkened arena after the Republican convention. The camera pauses at posters that list the size of campaign contributions from various industries to Mr. Bush and Republican committees. The spot closes with text giving the telephone number of Mr. Bush's office in Austin, Tex., and the Web address of American Family Voices.
 
SCRIPT -- "The convention's over," a narrator says. "And look who won. The insurance industry; they've invested millions in George W. Bush, who vetoed a patients' bill of rights in Texas. Nursing home operators; they've given over a hundred thousand to Bush, who weakened nursing home laws in Texas, while patient complaints doubled. The big drug companies; they've kicked in millions for Bush, who joined them in opposing guaranteed Medicare prescription coverage. Tell Bush when special interests win, America's families lose."
 
ACCURACY -- The advertisement gives big numbers for industry contributions to Mr. Bush ($4.3 million from the insurance industry, $2.3 million from drug companies), but they include large soft-money donations to Republican Party committees and smaller donations to the Bush campaign. The advertisement's other assertions are based on newspaper articles and are oversimplified but not false, although Mr. Bush has not opposed Medicare prescription drug coverage but only insisted that the benefit not be fully financed by taxpayers.
 
SCORECARD -- With this spot, the labor movement and liberal interests are putting Mr. Bush and other Republicans on notice that they will conduct an aggressive negative campaign on economic issues this fall. Unions have budgeted millions of dollars for this and similar efforts that will support Democratic candidates around the country. JOHN M. BRODER

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE DEMOCRATIC TEAM;
Standing With the Centrists In a Play for the New South

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Aug. 10

 BODY:
Vice President Al Gore surrounded himself with centrist Democratic governors from Southern states today and delivered a stem-winding populist speech in an effort to demonstrate that the South was still in play in this year's election.
Alongside Mr. Gore, a Middle Tennessean and a Southern Baptist, stood his running mate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, a Connecticut Yankee and an Orthodox Jew whose introduction to the South came in 1963 when he helped register black voters in Mississippi. 
 That would not have always been an alluring resume to many of the independent white Southerners whom Mr. Gore and Mr. Lieberman must capture in order to win states like Georgia this year. But the Democrats played up Mr. Lieberman's religion and his history today, calculating that the South had changed, that Mr. Lieberman's selection would excite minority voters, and that the ticket's centrism and religious faith might appeal to white Southerners.
At the rally in Centennial Olympic Park, Mr. Lieberman said he saw "how good our nation can be" when he watched his fellow student volunteers put their lives on the line to register voters in the 1960's.
"Today," Mr. Lieberman said, "I am so proud to stand before you as the first Jewish-American lucky enough to be a major party candidate for vice president of the United States. And when I look at Al Gore, the man who made it possible, and I think about the courage and character that went into making this decision, once again I see a glimpse of how good our nation can be."
The most recent polls, some of which are dated, show Mr. Gore trailing his Republican rival, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, in every Southern state except for his native Tennessee, and the race appears closer than expected there. But Gore campaign officials say Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Florida, North Carolina and Tennessee remain in play.
Republican strategists expressed confidence today that the resurgent appeal of statewide Democratic candidates in the South would not transfer to a national election, and that Mr. Gore would not replicate President Clinton's success in winning four Southern states in 1992 and 1996.
"It's difficult for national Democrats to convince Southern voters that they are similar to the moderate Democratic governors they have elected," said Q. Whitfield Ayres, a Republican pollster here.
Several of the Democratic governors disagreed, saying Mr. Lieberman's selection had been received warmly in their states.
"The values people had when I was growing up -- respect of marriage and family, respect of the Sabbath, that's what they see in Joe Lieberman," said Gov. James B. Hunt Jr. of North Carolina, who is completing his fourth term.
Gov. Roy Barnes of Georgia said the choice helped by demonstrating Mr. Gore's independence. "Look," he said, "we Southerners are not aliens from another planet. Attitudes have changed and the stereotype of the South of 50 years ago is not the South of today. And, remember, populism was born in the South."
Mr. Gore embraced that populist tradition today when he told the crowd he would raise the minimum wage, provide prescription drug benefits for the elderly, lower school class sizes and "take medical decisions away from bureaucrats who work for H.M.O.'s."
"Do you remember what it was like eight years ago?" he asked. Someone in the crowd answered, "Pitiful."
"Pitiful, you are exactly right," Mr. Gore said. "We had $300 billion annual budget deficits. That bunch had quadrupled the national debt in little over a decade. We were broke. High unemployment. We'd had the worst recession since the 1930's. We saw crime rising, families breaking up at a higher rate. All the problems were worse."
Mr. Gore said President Clinton and he had changed things, and reminded his audience that Mr. Bush said in his nomination acceptance speech that the Democrats had "coasted through prosperity" and taken the path of least resistance.
"I wish there had been less resistance," Mr. Gore said. "I cast the tie-breaking vote after all the ones on the other side voted no for the change that was so needed. I wish there had been less resistance when they shut down the government, not once but twice. I wish there had been less resistance when we brought about the changes that have now led to a dramatic transformation in our economy."
Mr. Lieberman said the accusations that the last eight years had been squandered were nonsense, saying, "If you're one of the people working in one of the 22 million jobs that have been created in this country since 1993, these haven't been squandered years."
Mr. Gore was joined today by Governors Donald Siegelman of Alabama and Paul E. Patton of Kentucky, along with Mr. Barnes and Mr. Hunt.

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES;
On the Path to Create a School of Thought

BYLINE: By SHAILA K. DEWAN 

 BODY:
GREGORY JAVAN MILLS is talking about the collection he has spent 20 years assembling: 5,000 films starring black actors or made by black producers and directors. There is "Tamango," with Dorothy Dandridge as a slave who has a love affair with her master. There is "Joe's Bed-Stuy Barbershop: We Cut Heads," an early film by Spike Lee. There is "Harlem Rides the Range," an all-black western from the 1940's.
So what are the prized possessions in Mr. Mills's collection at the New York State Black Film Archive? 
 "I wouldn't call them possessions," he stammers, then begs, "You have to phrase it another way."
He is sitting in a film and video classroom in the Adam Clayton Powell State Office Building on 125th Street in Harlem. A Bell & Howell projector so old that it looks like an antique refrigerator, with a door that flaps open if it is not latched, sits on a coffee table. The machine was built for the military, it turns out. But it is not his prized possession. Finally, Mr. Mills decides that his prized possession is "the ability to steer this organization on the right path."
And there it is: unreconstituted artspeak, or rather, arts administrator-speak, that falls so easily from the tongues of the type of executive director whose job includes running the projector and making the popcorn. Mr. Mills talks as if he is writing a grant, or perhaps has written too many: careful, measured and heavy on what some might call truisms. "There's always room for improvement," he says after being asked if things are better for black artists now than in the 1970's.
At the Harlem Week 2000 Black Film Festival, which ends on Sunday, Mr. Mills is showing films that have not been screened in half a century or more. They are drawn from his archive, which he describes as the largest collection of black films. Mr. Mills's films are stored in the basement of the office building and in other places, including his apartment, the studio in Harlem where he has lived, alone, since he moved to Manhattan in the 1970's. "I'm like Duke Ellington: this is what I do, this is my family. Duke Ellington said, 'Music is my mistress.' "
But collecting movies was an ordeal at first. In the early 1980's, Mr. Mills would set up a table outside the New York Public Library, offering information about his organization. The idea was, once people came up to the table, they would slip some change into the donation jar. He ended up with more than money: he met film collectors from Brooklyn, who provided the reels for the first Black Film Festival, in 1985. The collaboration was, in Mr. Mills's terms, "an opportunity to bring Manhattan and Brooklyn together."
But the collectors did not volunteer to help him build a collection. "I would say, 'How do you get this stuff?' They would say, 'We got the connections.' "
MR. MILLS, 48, did not start off with much of an interest in film, although as a child in Winston-Salem, N.C., he loved Bette Davis. And he remembers overhearing his mother, a public-school dietitian, talk about Dorothy Dandridge's death (in 1965, at 42, of an overdose of prescription drugs). His father worked on cars. "I don't think I wanted to work in the cafeteria or be a mechanic," he says, "so I became an artist."
A painter, to be specific. He spent a few years in the Air Force (his "Peter Max period," he calls it; he painted a psychedelic mural for the noncommissioned officers' club at Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota). Then, thanks to the G.I. Bill, he moved to New York and enrolled at the School of Visual Arts. He still quotes Oscar Wilde and Jimi Hendrix like an ardent student.
Here is something he says the professors did not teach him at the school: in the 1970's, New York galleries would not show "black art," and that included abstract paintings by a black artist, namely, him. Here is something they did teach him there: artists start schools of thought, like Bauhaus, the Ash Can School and Dada. So, at school, he decided to start a "school of thought for artists of color." One of his first projects was to help a fellow student whose photographs of children playing in Harlem had been declared "unaesthetic" at Visual Arts. His letters of protest led the administration to reconsider, and the student got the degree that had been hanging in the balance. A panel discussion on race and the arts, the first of many, followed.
In the early 80's, Mr. Mills saw a public television segment on Oscar Micheaux, who made films in the early 20's and 30's about black life and who was nicknamed the Midnight Rambler because he often rented white movie theaters after midnight to show his films. Mr. Mills knew nothing about the man.
That's the way of things. Know nothing, start a film festival. Fortunately, Mr. Mills and Ernest Steele, who became the archivist, found -- without the help of the Brooklyn collectors -- the Donnell Library Center in Midtown Manhattan, which houses the city's film archives. They spent days researching distributors and collectors and building a network of people who would alert them when rare prints came on the market.
In the 1980's, worried that the recession was hurting support of the arts in Harlem, he considered quitting. "I thought, 'Let's have an auction, sell off everything, everyone go back to their first love.' " Then another grant came through, and changed his mind.

HEADLINE: In the Oil-Rich Nigeria Delta, Deep Poverty and Grim Fires

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI 

DATELINE: OVIRI-COURT, Nigeria, Aug. 6

 BODY:
As the rain clattered on his aluminum roof, Akierou Awe sat in a gloomy corner of his mud-brick house and spoke softly of the fuel-pipeline explosion that killed three of his sons last month, not far from his village in this oil-soaked corner of Africa.
Fuel had been leaking from the pipeline at a spot deep in the bush, near a forest of rubber trees. Villagers had been scooping it up with jerrycans, washbasins and plastic bottles that they carried away in wheelbarrows, hoping to resell it for a few pennies above the official rate of 21 cents a quart. 
 Then perhaps a wheelbarrow knocked against another, causing a spark.
The explosion shook Mr. Awe's house early on the morning of July 10. The fire spread along a mile-long stretch of the pipeline, killing more than 300 people, including his sons Kingsley, 23; Tuesday, 22, and Gift, 20, all of whom tapped rubber trees for a living.
"Even as you see me now, I am no longer a full human being," Mr. Awe, 65, a retired civil servant, said, so softly that the rain nearly drowned out his words. "Gift attended secondary school and he was supposed to finish this year." A fourth son, Hope, 20, had been with his brothers but was not killed. Hope was still in the hospital, but his father did not know whether he would survive.
The Niger Delta of Nigeria, one of the world's top oil producers, has been the center of violent despair for years. A swampy patch of land, laced by tributaries of West Africa's great Niger River, it yields almost all of Nigeria's two million barrels a day of crude, most of which ends up at gas stations in the United States.
But because of this country's complicated history of ethnic politics, delta residents have remained stunningly and desperately poor. The residents are members of ethnic minorities; partly out of fear that Nigeria might break up one day, the Hausa-speaking northern generals who have ruled most of the time since independence have kept the oil-rich delta poor and weak.
And recently, in gruesome displays of that poverty, hundreds have been burned to death in at least five explosions as they tried to scoop up leaking fuel.
Perhaps more than any other country on the continent, Nigeria -- where one in six Africans live -- has focused attention on the problematic role of natural resources, which have enriched the African elite and Western businesses but slowed development.
Nigeria is the nightmare that loomed before World Bank officials who recently approved a $3.7 billion oil pipeline for Chad; it is a warning for tiny Equatorial Guinea, where oil started gushing four years ago.
Pipelines have exploded in many poor nations. The biggest explosions since the early 1980's occurred in 1984 in Brazil, where 508 were killed; in 1994 in Egypt, where there were 529 deaths; and in 1998 in Cameroon, where at 220 died.
But Nigeria leads by a wide margin: in the last two years, official figures indicate, more than 2,000 women, men and children have died in pipeline explosions. Many believe that the real figure is even higher.
What is more, while explosions elsewhere result from accidents, here the source is sabotage. Organized rings of thieves with knowledge of the pipelines, allied with corrupt government and military officials, are believed to siphon huge quantities of fuel with sophisticated equipment and trucks.
The leaks eventually attract jerrycan-grasping villagers, invariably the ones who end up being killed.
"Because of the level of grinding poverty in the Niger Delta, when there are these leaks, people see it as an opportunity to make some money despite the dangers," said Doifie Ola, director of Environmental Rights Action, a Lagos-based organization that monitors explosions. "Similar incidents are likely to keep recurring if nothing concrete is done."
Immediately after assuming power in May 1999, President Olusegun Obasanjo visited the delta. He raised great hopes among its seven million inhabitants, but little has been accomplished. A Niger Delta development bill has yet to become law.
In fact the most notable government action was the military's destruction of a town called Odi last November after residents killed 12 police officers. President Obasanjo later expressed regret for the attack on Odi, which many see as the single most startling violation of human rights during his term.
Port Harcourt, one of the two oil centers in the delta, had tentatively been on the itinerary of President Clinton, who is to visit Nigeria this month. But it is now unlikely he will come to the delta; he will very likely spend most of his visit in the capital, Abuja.
The delta is growing increasingly restive. Early this month, youths held hostage 165 workers associated with Shell, the biggest oil exporter, eventually releasing them. And vandalism of oil pipelines has risen sharply.
The targets are usually not the multinationals' pipelines, which carry crude oil for export, but lines connected to government-owned refineries that process crude in the delta and ship easy-to-resell gasoline or kerosene through a 3,250-mile network crisscrossing Nigeria.
The country's four oil refineries have long been the source of corruption: Gen. Sani Abacha, the former dictator, allowed them to deteriorate so severely that Nigeria found itself in the absurd position of importing gasoline -- through the general's middlemen -- from non-oil-producing nations.
Since General Abacha's death in June 1998, the refineries have been repaired, making the delivery network the target of thieves who siphon out fuel.
Some results have been grim. In October 1998, 1,082 people were killed, by official tally, in a huge explosion in Jesse, not far from here. A pipeline connected to a refinery in Warri, the second oil center of the delta, was punctured.
In 1999 government pipelines were sabotaged 497 times, according the state-run Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, which owns and operates the pipeline network. In the first three months of this year, the number had already reached 200.
In the first five months, $20 million was lost in stolen fuel and damage done to pipelines, the petroleum corporation estimates.
The state-run corporation fired some of its workers after villagers reported their involvement in the siphoning: they had employed soldiers to guard tankers that were driven along the pipelines to collect the fuel.
Jackson Gaius-Obaseki, managing director of the oil corporation, acknowledged the collusion at a news conference in Warri after visiting victims of the latest explosion, and said more dismissals were planned.
At another news conference, a corporation spokesman, Ndu Ughamadu, said that although villagers had been scooping up the fuel, they could not have been the ones to puncture it.
"Our engineers have told us that vandalization of oil pipelines takes a scientific process which ordinary villagers can't engage in," he said. "There must be well-placed people that have links with this pipeline vandalization. Where they have located a pipeline, they will perforate holes and quietly they will lay pipelines for up to one kilometer, where they siphon the fuel at will."
To reach the pipeline from here in Oviri-Court, one must quit a dirt road and hike a half-mile into the bush. Wooden planks remain on the muddy stretches to allow access to vehicles -- evidence, villagers said, that an organized ring had come here with a truck and equipment. A big hole had been dug, exposing the pipeline, which now lay underwater.
The explosion charred the trees in the area; their leafless black skeletons rise out of darkened water. The 300 bodies have been carried away. But the tools of the dead lay scattered around: washbasins, countless plastic bottles, jerrycans, a scorched bicycle, two wheelbarrows.
Adeje, a nearby village with no electricity, no tap water and no paved road, is typical of the Niger Delta -- in fact better off than villages accessible only by boat.
Timothy Oghoro, a community leader in his 70's, was one of many villagers who said they had reported the leaking pipeline to the local authorities.
But nothing had been done, Mr. Oghoro said, because the vandals were well connected and had siphoned the fuel under military escort.
"The police are not here to protect us," Mr. Oghoro said. "If the government wanted to protect us, they would employ people to man the pipeline. No one will go there."
Another local leader, David Okomore, 45, said he and the village chief, Benson Egberebo, 65, once videotaped a leaking pipeline.
"The soldiers pounced on us," he said. "The chief was taken to the police station and interrogated."
Mr. Okomore, one of the few college-educated men in the village, said two of his cousins, women aged 50 and 19, had been killed in the explosion. He had to identify their bodies, which were buried in a mass grave. "Because they were poor and uneducated," he said, "they were scooping the fuel."
Mr. Okomore foresees repercussions beyond the deaths: "Because of the explosion and the destruction, the farms we have won't produce anymore -- even the river has been polluted. There will be even less for the people to do here."
Surely, he added, the destruction will make more people hopeless. More will scoop for fuel. He is not counting on the government.
"When we ask for compensation," he said, "they harass us with soldiers. There's nothing we can do. We only live by the mercy of God now."

HEADLINE: A Trap of Welfare And Child Abuse

BYLINE: By Patrick T. Murphy; Patrick T. Murphy, public guardian of Cook County, Illinois, is author of "Drowning in Hot Water," a novel.

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
I have represented abused and neglected children in court for decades, and, like many others in close contact with the child welfare system, I never bought the predictions that welfare reform would send more parents into the pathology of abuse. I thought the opposite, because I expected the birth rate for teenagers on welfare to go down once the system stopped encouraging births. That would mean fewer families under intense stress. 
 So when statistics reported this week showed that child abuse cases have gone down nationwide since the new welfare law was passed in 1996, I was surprised only at how quickly the decline had showed itself.
In Chicago, the number of abused and neglected children in the system has fallen by nearly half in the years since the old safety net was removed. A major reason is that there are fewer new cases of abuse. In New York, too, cases are decreasing, not increasing.
In the same years, birth rates for both white and African-American teenagers have also dropped substantially. Certainly, welfare reform is not the complete reason. A thriving economy has to have played a role in giving people an incentive to break old patterns, as has education reinforcing a deliberate message about irresponsible teenage behavior. Though I can't prove it, I believe welfare reform is just as important an ingredient.
Opponents of welfare reform ridiculed the notion that children were having children in order to get welfare. In the most literal sense, they were right. But children having children had become part of the culture surrounding many girls whose families were on welfare, and government support had allowed it to flourish. The girls having the babies were not equipped to see the consequences in their own lives or their children's.
A typical abuse case that I see now involves a woman in her early 20's who has between two and four children, usually by different fathers. She had her first child when she should have been reading "Macbeth" as a sophomore in high school and her second when she should have been reading "Hamlet" as a senior. The fathers have shirked all responsibility and disappeared. By the time the woman is in her 20's, she has four children and no involved man to help her. She turns to drugs as the only viable opportunity for a vacation. Or, as some argue, for self-medication.
We bring her to court on abuse charges, give her a counselor and ultimately return the children, whereupon she goes back to her bleak housing project, looks out the window and realizes that without an education and job opportunities, her future, and that of her children, is nonexistent. Her depression is based on reality. She ultimately turns back to drugs or liquor or both, and the children are abused or neglected again.
These cases began when our welfare system was still sending out an illusory promise to inexperienced girls that they and their children would be supported for the rest of their lives. The truth was that the support was absolutely minimal and could never be more than minimal.
A couple of years ago, one of our lawyers picked up a 14-year-old inner-city girl who had just delivered a baby at a Chicago hospital. On the way out, a social worker warned the girl that the next time she had a child, she should be more serious about prenatal care. Today, the girl would more likely have been warned that having children mortgaged her future and told about ways of controlling her fertility, from abstinence to abortion.
Has welfare reform worked? It's probably too early to tell. But the social worker's dismissive assumption about an inner-city girl's needs would not be so easy now. Nor could the girl so easily accept repeated early motherhood. I believe this fundamental change will translate into even fewer abused children needing my help a few years from now.

HEADLINE: Retail Plan for Armory Upsets School Advocates

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
A City Hall plan to rebuild the Kingsbridge Armory in the Bronx as a retail complex drew more than 200 protesters to the huge, fortress-like building yesterday, where they called for new school rooms instead of chain stores on the site.
Criticism of the City Hall proposal is growing from members of the Bronx clergy and the city's Democratic coalition in Congress, who say it ignores both a drastic need for classroom space in the northwest Bronx and the availability of federal school construction aid to provide it. 
 "The mayor would do well to listen to this community," said Representative Eliot L. Engel, the Bronx Democrat, who attended the rally. In an interview, he said the new retail complex proposed by City Hall "is the worst thing they could put here."
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani announced the city's plan for the Kingsbridge Armory, a decrepit, 80-year-old structure that fills an entire block off Kingsbridge Road and Jerome Avenue, in his State of the City address in January.
Under the plan, $30 million in city financing has been set aside to repair the armory's massive roof, which engineers say could collapse. The city selected RD Management, a shopping mall developer based in Manhattan, to spend $80 million or more to renovate the rest of the building for use as a recreational complex, a multiplex and at least one chain store.
But almost a year before the mayor's announcement, the Northwest Bronx Community & Clergy Coalition, a neighborhood group that has long advocated housing and youth programs in the neighborhoods surrounding the armory site, approached the mayor's staff with a plan to devote at least part of it to public classrooms.
The group said it spent $50,000, using grants from foundations, to prepare architectural drawings showing how the armory could house 1,800 classroom seats, to be used by two or three public schools. It estimated the cost at $110 million.
"The need for classroom space is tremendous, and if we miss this opportunity it gets worse," said Ronn Jordon, a member of the Bronx group. District 10 in the Bronx is the third most crowded in the city, according to Board of Education records.
The Bronx group also approached City Hall with a suggestion for financing the project in part: a federal school construction program sponsored in 1998 by Representative Charles B. Rangel that would make as much as $60 million a year available to New York State to build schools in poor neighborhoods where businesses or private donors agree to pick up part of the cost.
"Armories are a gift, since we have to take advantage of existing structures," Mr. Rangel said. "It is so sad the mayor has blinders on."
But Michael Carey, president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, said the city had already given ample consideration to the proposal for schools at the armory site, and rejected the idea.
"It will take a tremendous amount of money to maintain this building," he said, "and its best custodian for the future is the private sector."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE LABOR EFFORT;
Finding Another Loophole, a New Secretive Group Springs Up

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 10

 BODY:
Turning to a second legal loophole after another was closed, one of the nation's largest unions, a leading supporter of Vice President Al Gore, has quietly created a group that this week is televising an advertisement harshly critical of Gov. George W. Bush.
Neither the group's ad nor its Web site (www.checkforyourself.com) discloses its relationship with the union, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, or Afscme. 
 Afscme provided $800,000 to start the organization, American Family Voices. In a news release and on its Web site, the group describes its mission as advocacy of "progressive policies, especially economic issues." It says its membership includes advocates for consumers, health care, education, children, the elderly, civil rights and labor.
The organization was created in July, after Congress closed a loophole in federal tax and election law known as Section 527, under which groups were able, with virtually no disclosure, to raise and spend unlimited sums to spread political messages. American Family Voices was instead chartered under Section 501(c)4, a longstanding provision in the tax code that allows it to engage in political activity with minimal financial disclosure.
Afscme, which has 1.3 million members, endorsed Vice President Gore last autumn, months before he sealed the Democratic presidential nomination.
The executive director of American Family Voices is Michael Lux, a longtime liberal campaigner who worked for two years in the Clinton White House and has been affiliated with People for the American Way.
The new effort makes organized labor the latest of a number of interests, as varied as the Sierra Club and the pharmaceutical industry, to set up independent groups to underwrite political advertising and other election-related activities.
Under its Section 501(c)4 tax status, American Family Voices is permitted to engage in political activities like polling, lobbying and issue advertising but is not permitted to advocate the election or defeat of individual candidates. Such groups must file public information returns with the Internal Revenue Service but are not required to disclose the sources of their income.
They are reminiscent of secretive groups set up under Section 527. Sam Wyly, for instance, a wealthy benefactor of Mr. Bush, created a group called Republicans for Clean Air that ran television advertisements during the primaries attacking the environmental record of the Texas governor's chief rival, Senator John McCain of Arizona.
In June, Congress passed legislation requiring Section 527 groups to disclose their major contributors and spending. American Family Voices was created after the legislation took effect on July 1, Mr. Lux said. As a result, it could not take advantage of the Section 527 nondisclosure loophole and will instead operate under the minimal-disclosure requirements of Section 501(c)4.
Mr. Lux said he had raised $700,000 in addition to the sum provided by Afscme and intended to use the money this fall to buy issue advertising in the presidential campaign and selected Congressional races. He declined to identify the group's other contributors, saying only that they were organizations and individuals who shared the union's policy agenda for working people.
The advertisement against Governor Bush, which is running this week in Philadelphia, Detroit, St. Louis and Washington, attacks him for vetoing patients' rights legislation, weakening nursing home regulations and opposing government-guaranteed prescription drug benefits under Medicare. It links his policies to large contributions from the insurance, nursing home and drug industries.
Afscme's president, Gerald McEntee, said in an interview that American Family Voices was one of a number of independent political efforts that the union would undertake this fall on issues of importance to working families, including health care, education, the environment and taxes.
Fred Wertheimer, an advocate of revisions in federal campaign law, said the union's hidden sponsorship of American Family Voices dramatized a longstanding problem in American politics.
"Closing the Section 527 secrecy loophole just solved one of the problems," Mr. Wertheimer said. "This is another example of interests' conducting blatant electioneering activities and hiding their donors. And it's a huge problem. This conduct is an evasion of the spirit of disclosure laws and will be a growing problem that will have to be solved just like the Section 527 groups were."

HEADLINE: U.S. Child Poverty Rate Fell as Economy Grew, But Is Above 1979 Level

BYLINE: By DON TERRY 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Aug. 10

 BODY:
Child poverty rates fell significantly in many states in the current economic boom, but nationwide, and in all but a handful of states, child poverty is still higher than it was 20 years ago, according to a study released today by the National Center for Children in Poverty at Columbia University.
More than 13 million American children, 3 million more than in 1979, live in poverty. 
 Here in California, where 1 out of 6 of the nation's poor children live, child poverty has been particularly stubborn. According to the study, the child poverty rate soared by 90 percent from 1979 to 1993 as the Golden State was badly tarnished by recession, and declined only 14.9 percent in the next five years of economic growth.
The recent decline in California was encouraging but still lagged behind the rest of the nation, which saw a 17.1 percent decline after a 38.8 percent increase from 1979 to 1993.
Nationally, according to census data, the child poverty rate rose to 18.7 percent in 1998, the most current information available, from 16.2 percent in 1979. In New York, the rate is 24.2 percent, or nearly 1 in 4 children living in poverty, up from 18.9 percent in 1979.
Elected officials and advocates for children across the country cited low wages and high living costs as primary factors in the persistence of child poverty.
Deborah Leff, president and chief executive officer of America's Second Harvest, the nation's largest domestic hunger relief organization, said a family earning the minimum wage was "literally earning thousands of dollars under the poverty line," which in 1998 was $16,666 for a family of four and today is $17,050.
"You can get off welfare, work hard, play by the rules and still not be able to feed your family," Ms. Leff said.
Elie Ward, the executive director of Statewide Youth Advocacy, said poverty rates in New York had often been worse than the national ones because of the high cost of living that low-income workers face in New York City.
Gail Nayowith, executive director of the Citizens' Committee for Children of New York, said the level of child poverty in New York was affected by the city's many immigrants, who often work for very low wages and have large families.
The report does not say why some states, like Illinois and New Jersey, have seen significant reductions in child poverty rates since 1979, and others have seen increases or relatively minor declines.
Whether welfare reform has had any effect on child poverty rates is also unclear, said Julian Palmer, a spokesman for the children's poverty center.
But Robert Goerge, assistant director of the Chapin Center for Children at the University of Chicago, said Illinois' early welfare overhaul, with generous benefits, which began in 1993, helped explain why the state's children had risen out of poverty.
That program, for instance, allowed welfare recipients to continue receiving health benefits and food stamps while easing into full-time employment, long before other states allowed such a benefit.
"You can make more money and not get penalized," Mr. Goerge said.
Jacqueline Tencza, a spokeswoman for the New Jersey Department of Human Services, said her state had used savings from cuts in welfare payments to help people who get off welfare.
For instance, Ms. Tencza said, $100 million that had previously been spent on welfare checks was shifted to subsidies for child care.
At $125 to $150 a week, child care often accounts for at least 40 percent of the take-home pay of a former welfare mother who has just joined the work force, Ms. Tencza said.
But in Georgia, where welfare caseloads have been reduced by more than half since 1997, the number of children in poverty rose more than 29 percent from 1993 to 1998, according to the study.
"I don't think anyone ever believed that the immediate result of welfare reform would be the reduction of poverty," said Michael L. Thurmond, commissioner of the Georgia Department of Labor and the architect of the state's welfare reform plan.
Poverty can take generations to overcome, Mr. Thurmond said.
In Los Angeles, poverty has dogged Zena Garcia and her children for years. But this year was going to be different. This year Mrs. Garcia was going to do something special for her son James's 12th birthday next Thursday. Maybe she would take him to the zoo or buy him one of those foldable scooters every child seems to zip by on. This year was going to be different because her husband, Manuel, 36, had a job.
"My husband is working as hard as he can, but it's still not enough to pay the bills," Mrs. Garcia, 43, said here the other day. "I haven't been able to pay the phone bill in two months, and they're about to cut it off. And on Friday, I have to make a choice: pay the gas bill or buy shoes for my daughter."
Her daughter, Virginia, is 6 and will start first grade in the fall. Mrs. Garcia knows what her choice will be. She is going to buy her daughter a pair of shoes. If the gas is shut off as a result, she said, "we'll deal with it."
"I want the same thing for my kids that every parent wants," she said.
Mr. Garcia works as a cook's assistant in a hospital, but has no steady hours and no benefits. He brings home $399 to $500 every two weeks. He has repeatedly applied for part-time or full-time status, which would provide crucial benefits.
"We're waiting and praying that it happens," Mrs. Garcia said.
Both Garcias, who were born in this country, completed a job training program in nearby Santa Monica at the St. Joseph Center, an organization that helps poor families. But so far Mrs. Garcia has not been able to find work and has returned to school to earn a high school equivalency diploma. As their case worker, Lupe Rojo, said, the Garcias are doing all they can to make it.
"It gets depressing," Mrs. Garcia said.
Her son lives in a home for troubled children. Mrs. Garcia talks to him every other day on the telephone, and that is why her phone bill is so high. She has not had the heart to tell him that he cannot go to the zoo or have a scooter.
"It's going to hurt," she said. "It's going to hurt me."
Her daughter has been pestering her about a scooter of her own. But seeing her mother near tears the other day, Virginia put a hand on Mrs. Garcia's shoulder and said, "Only get one, because I'll share mine with James."

HEADLINE: Crusading for Consumers All Around the Town

BYLINE: By EUN LEE KOH 

 BODY:
The boisterous cries on behalf of New York City's lowly consumers were heard from the Bronx to the Battery yesterday.
From the steps of City Hall to outside Madison Square Garden, city officials at separate news conferences championed consumer rights, wagging fingers at businesses that defraud or dupe their customers. 
 For the city's public advocate, Mark Green, the targets were the city's top three energy suppliers, which he accused of anticompetitive practices. For Assemblyman Jeffrey Klein of the Bronx, the cause was unsanitary supermarkets: he wants Gov. George E. Pataki to sign a bill that would make it easier for the state to shut down food stores that have failed inspections.
At Evergreen Videos, a small family-owned video store in Greenwich Village, the city's consumer affairs commissioner, Jane S. Hoffman, released a survey on the average price of a movie rental in the city. Ms. Hoffman said she chose the location because the store had one of the lowest rental prices in Manhattan.
And not to be outdone, the City Council speaker, Peter F. Vallone, denounced the rising cost of entertainment, from movies to sports tickets. He singled out the Knicks, whose games can cost as much as $220 per person.
For the individual officials, it was business as usual, but for all of them to jump on the consumer-protection trolley on the same day?
"People say consumers need a voice -- hey, they had plenty today," said Steve Sigmund, a spokesman for Mr. Green.
Spokesmen for the officials said the sudden convergence of consumer advocacy was sheer coincidence.
"We didn't plan any of this to happen all at once," said Michael Schlank, a spokesman for Mr. Klein. "I guess we're all just concerned about the welfare of the people in this city."
Mr. Schlank said that the assemblyman had no choice but to schedule his news conference yesterday, because Mr. Klein planned to fly to Los Angeles this weekend for the Democratic National Convention.
But in hushed tones, some spokesmen for the officials said there were other reasons for the sudden surge in consumer interests.
"It's the summer, and news is slow," a spokeswoman said. "Friday's generally a bad day to break news because no one reads the Saturday papers, so Thursday it was. And consumer advocacy always gets everyone's wheels turning."
Regardless, the city officials put on their sternest faces and said "tsk, tsk" to consumer-unfriendly industries.
Mr. Vallone took up the cause of the average New Yorker who simply wants to see a movie or a basketball game.
"New York is becoming so expensive that many families can't afford to go to the movies or even out for ice cream," Mr. Vallone said. "It is unacceptable that during this economic boom, basic entertainment is beyond the reach of working people."
With furrowed brow, Mr. Klein released a list of what he called the city's 10 worst supermarkets, some of which he said had sold contaminated foods that included rat droppings.
Ms. Hoffman held up a copy of "Casablanca" as she told New Yorkers that renting a movie should not be "risky business." She warned New Yorkers to look out for unusually high late fees or exorbitant membership costs.
At City Hall, Mr. Green said that deregulation of energy suppliers had driven up costs for consumers.
"Because there is excessive demand and inadequate supply, deregulation has forced consumers and businesses to end up paying millions of extra dollars for power this summer," he said.

NEW YORK
 
BRONX: COCAINE SEIZED -- Federal agents yesterday announced the seizure of nearly 670 kilograms of cocaine in the Bronx on Saturday. They said that agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration and New York City police officers arrested three men and charged them with drug trafficking after searching a van and finding 50 kilograms of cocaine. The other 619 kilograms were discovered during a search of a nearby apartment. John Sullivan (NYT) 

MANHATTAN: VIRUS RESEARCH FINANCING CRITICIZED -- In a letter to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Senator Charles E. Schumer has complained that New York is not getting enough money to track the West Nile virus. He said that this year, the centers would distribute about $6.9 million nationwide for such monitoring, but that New York's share would be only $720,000, or about one-tenth of the total. The Centers for Disease Control did not return a phone call seeking comment yesterday. Meanwhile, the Suffolk County health commissioner, Clare B. Bradley, said that it was likely that "West Nile virus is present throughout Suffolk County." (AP)
 
MANHATTAN: MAN BEATEN AT HOME -- A man was badly beaten by a burglar at his home yesterday, the police said. The man's wife returned to their West 81st Street apartment at 6:50 p.m. and found her husband, Jack Kravitz, 57, beaten in the head and face, an investigator said. The attack is not thought to be linked to seven other violent burglaries on the Upper West Side, said Detective John Giammarino, a police spokesman. Mr. Kravitz was in critical condition at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center. Andy Newman (NYT)
 
MANHATTAN: WOMAN TELLS OF TRAIN ACCIDENT -- A woman who was thought to have jumped in front of a train that tore off her leg on July 31 has recovered consciousness and on Monday told detectives she was pushed onto the tracks by a robber, said Detective John Giammarino, a police spokesman. The woman, Buo Yu You, 55, of Delancey Street was hit by a J train at the Bowery station. Ms. You, who also suffered head injuries, was in stable condition at Bellevue Hospital Center last night, the authorities said. Andy Newman (NYT)
 
YAPHANK: ORGANIC GOLF COURSES -- Suffolk County has agreed to build two 18-hole public golf courses here without using pesticides. Robert L. Garfinkle, an assistant county attorney, said the courses would be among the first in the country to use organic methods from their inception. The action stems from a lawsuit brought by the Long Island Neighborhood Network of Massapequa, which said the original plans for the golf courses, which are to be built on public land, failed to comply with state environmental law. John Rather (NYT)
 
MANHATTAN: MANY CASES, ONE TRIAL -- A judge ruled yesterday that she would hold one trial for a Manhattan man, Arohn Kee, charged with three murders and four rapes in Harlem, despite protests by the man's lawyers that he would not get a fair trial because of the complexity and volume of evidence. Justice Joan Sudolnik of State Supreme Court in Manhattan said asking witnesses to testify in four trials would be too much. Dean E. Murphy (NYT)
 
WHITE PLAINS: UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS SCHEME -- In the latest crackdown effort on those who illegally claim unemployment benefits, the Westchester County district attorney has accused 22 Westchester residents who have jobs of stealing a combined $78,000 in benefits from the State Labor Department. Each defendant faces up to four years in prison. The defendants allegedly collected benefits ranging from $1,711 to $9,490 between June 1997 and January of this year, said Jeanine F. Pirro, the district attorney. Al Baker (NYT)
 
MANHATTAN: CHILDREN'S INSURANCE -- New York is among the states with the most success in enrolling children in the federal Children's Health Insurance Program, according to a new report from the Children's Defense Fund. With 453,000 enrollments in the government insurance program, New York is in fourth place, behind Alaska, Massachusetts and Maryland, the report found. Jennifer Steinhauer (NYT)
 
MANHATTAN: NEW CHIEF FOR CABRINI HOSPITAL -- Paul J. Candino has been named president and chief executive of Cabrini Medical Center in Manhattan, succeeding Jeffrey Frerichs, who resigned in July. Mr. Candino will continue as president and chief executive of Prism Network Inc., a corporation that specializes in developing health care systems for insurance companies. Jennifer Steinhauer (NYT)
 
BROOKLYN: CHARGES IN BANK ROBBERIES -- Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn charged 13 men yesterday with being part of a mob-connected robbery ring that broke into nearly 30 banks from Long Island to Florida between 1992 and 1999, stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars from vaults and deposit boxes. One man, George Ludwigsen of Boca Raton, Fla., is the younger brother of Chris Paciello, a Miami nightclub owner who is to go on trial next month on charges of bank robbery and murder. Alan Feuer (NYT)
 
CONNECTICUT
 
HARTFORD: DELAY URGED FOR TRIBAL RECOGNITION -- After two days of talks in Washington about the federal government's plan to recognize two Connecticut Indian tribes, the state attorney general, Richard Blumenthal, has urged the Interior Department to postpone its decision. Numerous questions remain about the tribe's claims, Mr. Blumenthal said. The Interior Department research used to determine whether the tribes, the Eastern Pequots and the Paucatuck Eastern Pequots, deserve formal recognition is flawed, he asserted. Tribal recognition carries several benefits, including potential casino ventures. The Bureau of Indian Affairs did not return a phone call seeking comment. David M. Herszenhorn (NYT)
 
NEW JERSEY
 
TRENTON: UTILITY BILLS FOR THE POOR -- A group called New Jersey Citizen Action wants state regulators to allow utilities to charge low-income customers a fixed percentage of their income when they pay their utility bills. Poor people typically must devote 10 to 13 percent of their income to utilities, leading to more than 100,000 disconnections because of unpaid bills, the group said. Under the plan, low-income customers would pay 3 percent of their income. In return, the utilities would get some money instead of none and would keep families from using potentially dangerous alternatives like kerosene lamps. (NYT)

HEADLINE: Anarchism's Appeal

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "Anarchism, the Creed That Won't Stay Dead" (Arts & Ideas pages, Aug. 5): 
 I applaud the anarchists' inclination to reject established political, economic and social order. The Republican Party's current slogan, "compassionate conservatism," is oxymoronic. The Democrats' claim to be the party of inclusion and diversity is often undermined by their choice of nominees for high office (Joseph I. Lieberman notwithstanding). And transnational institutions like the World Trade Organization seek to impose selfish economic standards without regard for the human costs.
But I draw the line at the neo-Luddite aversion to technological progress. Informed by creative, humanitarian ideals, technology can foster social justice. It is only when technology is left to global-business buccaneers and their fellow travelers that it becomes a tool for rapacious acquisition, consumption and other forms of self-indulgence.

HEADLINE: Seeking Out a Just Way To Make Amends for Slavery;
The Idea of Reparations for Blacks Is Gaining in Urgency, But a Knot of Questions Remain, Like: Which Blacks?

BYLINE: By DIANE CARDWELL 

 BODY:
In recent years the issue of reparations has exploded among nations wrestling with the past. Scholars are beginning to see the German payout of $60 billion to Jewish victims of the Holocaust, the United States decision to pay reparations to Japanese-Americans who were interned during World War II and even Japan's awkward efforts to settle with Korean "comfort women" as bedrocks of a new political landscape.
Elazar Barkan, the chairman of the cultural studies department at Claremont Graduate University in California, contends that since the end of the cold war, the West in particular has entered a neo-Enlightenment period of political morality in which restitution increasingly plays a leading role. Political language has shifted, he writes in "The Guilt of Nations"(W.W. Norton), from machtpolitik, the politics of power, to a shared belief among nations in the rights of individuals and groups. 
 Consent and cooperation have become the buzzwords of global relations, Mr. Barkan says, and agreement is now being achieved through negotiation rather than force. "Certainly the eagerness of leaders -- Clinton, Blair, Chirac, the pope -- to atone has been mocked," he said during a telephone interview. "But there is a growing sense that you have to do the right thing."
In this new era, Mr. Barkan and others argue, the issue of American reparations for slavery -- straitjacketed for decades in a kind of intellectual Bedlam -- is beginning to look sane. "For so long it was just ludicrous for black folk to even bring up the notion that they might be entitled to some just compensation," said Michael Eric Dyson, the Ida B. Wells Barnett professor of religious studies at De Paul University in Chicago. "It was simply crazy." But after so many successful reparations campaigns, including those for economic and cultural restitution to various American Indian tribes, the African-American case has gained momentum.
Every year since 1989, Representative John Conyers Jr., Democrat of Michigan, has sponsored a bill to establish a commission to study reparations for slavery. It remains stuck in committee, but away from Capitol Hill other developments are having a significant impact on the national debate.
Black intellectuals like Randall Robinson, the president of TransAfrica, a lobbying group, and the author of "The Debt: What America Owes to Blacks," and the Harvard University professors Charles T. Ogletree and Henry Louis Gates Jr. have publicly supported reparations. Individual cities and towns are confronting their racist pasts: some, like Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland and Dallas, support Federal hearings on reparations while others, like Tulsa, Okla., Rosewood, Fla., and Elaine, Ark., are either considering or are paying monetary damages for past atrocities. As Mr. Dyson explains, "African-Americans themselves are beginning to be politicized around this debate."
Mr. Barkan writes that slavery remains "the most glaring example of an unaddressed historical injustice in the United States." He adds that this "stands in direct contrast with the public culture that embraces the concept of attempting to redress its imperfect past."
But opponents of reparations commonly argue that other examples of past imperfection are redressable in ways that slavery is not. In the case of the Japanese-Americans, the victims themselves were compensated for quantifiable, provable suffering at the hands of an identifiable perpetrator, the United States Government. With the descendants of slaves, this argument goes, the situation is entirely different.
It is, first of all, said to be impossible to determine the actual present-day effect of slavery -- to trace the impact of slavery on, for example, today's overwhelming incarceration rate among black males, or to calculate all those generations of lost or artificially depressed wages. Not to mention the quagmire of determining who should be compensated. All blacks? Only those who demonstrate direct linkage to a slave? Should those of mixed race be included? Or what about Oprah?
Supporters of reparations find this line of argument irrelevant. "The way I look at historical crimes or historical injustices is do the victims still suffer, whether it is the victim or the victim's descendants," Mr. Barkan says. "Another issue that's been raised is, 'Why should I pay for it, I didn't do it?' It is a foolish argument. No one is responsible personally for any wrongdoing. But just to stop the action doesn't mean to have paid for the past. The perpetrator is very clear. It's the identity of the U.S. The U.S. as an entity is responsible."
Scott L. Malcomson, the author of the forthcoming "One Drop of Blood: The American Misadventure of Race" (Farrar, Straus & Giroux) points out that whites have been distancing themselves from moral culpability for slavery since as far back as the Revolutionary period. Thomas Jefferson, for instance, argued that it was the British who were to blame. Even so, many abolitionists at the time supported their own form of reparations: the establishment of a colony in Africa for freed slaves.
Although Mr. Barkan writes in "The Guilt of Nations" that national identity is a result of history, "for better and for worse," and therefore we "should pay our historical debts," Wendy Kaminer, a fellow at the Radcliffe Public Policy Center, recently argued the opposite point. Writing in American Prospect magazine, she said that the campaign for reparations "reflects some of the premises of the aristocracy it attacks." She continued: "It allows the past to define our entitlements in the present; it relies on a belief in the justice of inheritance. . . . If equality is a birthright, you don't have to purchase it with the sufferings of your ancestors, any more than you should be able to purchase privileges with your ancestors' achievements."
Indeed, just how the past should be used is at the crux of the debate. Ian Buruma, who has written extensively about the legacies of World War II, contends that the quest for reparations tends to mire the petitioners in the very victimization for which they seek payment, as well as encouraging a never-ending flood of restitution-seekers. "If every group that feels a historical wrong wants compensation, how far back do you go?" he asked in an interview. "It becomes problematic."
As ethnic groups in the United States and elsewhere have assimilated, Mr. Buruma went on, they have tended to replace their cultural identities with the residue of past discrimination. This leads, in his view, to resentment, which undermines the possibility of mutual understanding between groups.
"Instead of identifying as an American entitled to freedoms and rights and all men created equal," he said of African-Americans seeking reparations, "you are born into an aggrieved group deserving compensation. Then that's your whole identity and you can never get out of it."
For some, the argument against reparations is simply that any kind of compensation would be wholly inappropriate and inadequate recompense, not just for slavery but also for the entire array of racial injustices that trailed in slavery's wake. As the sociologist Glenn C. Loury wrote recently in The New York Times: "Who can say what the out-of-wedlock birth rate for blacks would be, absent chattel slavery? How does one calculate the cost of inner-city ghettos, of poor education, of the stigma of perceived racial inferiority? The severity of slavery's 'injury' is far more profound than any cash transfer will be able to reverse."
But for proponents, the word reparations can cover a host of interventions, from cash payments -- the current equivalent of, say, 40 acres and a mule -- to a direct, official apology from the President. Some argue that affirmative action policies already in place should be considered sufficient, though Mr. Barkan responds that affirmative action aims at fixing present injustices rather than compensating for past ones.
Mr. Robinson and Mr. Ogletree, among others, have suggested that reparations be used to finance social and economic development programs for the benefit of all black Americans. In another development, a lawyer named Deadria Farmer-Paellmann is compiling evidence for lawsuits against a dozen companies that she says demonstrably benefited from the slave trade. Among them are Providence Bank, a precursor of the FleetBoston Financial Corporation, and the Aetna Insurance Company of Hartford.
Ultimately, though, many proponents of reparations see the issue as a moral one that cannot be dismissed because the practicalities seem byzantine at the moment. "I think it's part of the social contract of justice in America," Mr. Dyson said, "that if black people have done what they've done and have been treated the way they've been treated, then they deserve what they deserve. And we can argue about what that dessert should look like, but it ain't come yet."

Share Prices Post Gains on Encouraging Economic Data

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Stocks rose yesterday as blue-chip issues surged on encouraging economic data. Concerns over the possiblity of a second-half earnings slowdown kept technology stocks from broader gains.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 119.04 points, or 1.1 percent, to 11,027.80. Yesterday was the first time since April that the index had crossed the 11,000 threshold. 
 Broader stock indicators were also higher.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 11.59 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,471.84, and the Nasdaq composite index was up 29.48 points, or 0.8 percent, to 3,789.47, having recovered from a loss of 60 points earlier in the session.
Analysts said a pattern had emerged recently in which investors reacted to daily news, causing markets to fluctuate from session to session.
"The market is kind of directionless," said John Caldwell, director of portfolio strategies for McDonald Investments in Cleveland. "People seem to be grasping, looking for some fundamental issue to hang their hat on.".
Yesterday, for example, blue-chip investors were encouraged by an inflation report that showed that producer prices remained virtually the same in July after a huge jump in June caused by soaring energy costs.
Among the sectors helping push the Dow higher were tobacco, banking, drugs and health care. Philip Morris rose 2 3/8, to 31, after an analyst at Goldman, Sachs said its stock could rise 50 to 60 percent this year. And the investment banking firm of Lehman Brothers closed up 6 3/4, 132 5/8, on positive inflation data.
Technology stocks fell in early trading but recovered. Dell Computer was punished after it announced earnings that beat Wall Street's targets but apparently disappointed the high expectations of investors. The company failed to live up to projected revenue growth figures. Its shares fell 4 1/16, to 37 11/16.

Treasury Prices Fall
By Bloomberg News
Treasury bond prices fell for the first time in four days yesterday after a rise in retail sales in July led to concern that the economy might not be slowing enough to stave off another interest rate increase this year by the Federal Reserve.
The most active 10-year note fell 7/32, to 99 24/32, as its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 5.78 percent from 5.75. The current 30-year bond fell 12/32, to 107 25/32, while its yield rose to 5.70 percent from 5.68.

Al Gore's Chicken Soup

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH 

 BODY:
So righteous, so brave, so bold. The verdict is in: Al Gore is the best thing to happen to the Jews since Oskar Schindler.
Such has been the ecstatic cry of the media bloviators once the vice president showed the guts, the courage and, yes (all together now!), the chutzpah to select a Jew -- an Orthodox Jew, yet -- as his running mate. Never mind that Alan Greenspan and Robert Rubin have been far more powerful than any vice president, Jewish or not, will ever be. Never mind that the also-rans on Mr. Gore's uninspiring list of potential running mates were of unambiguously lesser caliber than Joseph Lieberman. 
 No matter. For a political press desperate for a new story line, here it is: The Republicans may have Charlton Heston, but in the newly daring Mr. Gore the Democrats at last have their own Moses, who just might lead them to the Promised Land in November after all. According to one account, a presidential candidate considered "dull, cautious and incapable of stirring emotional loyalty even among his own supporters" has with this surprise pick jump-started his idling campaign. (Actually, the quote comes from The Times in July 1984, after Walter Mondale anointed Geraldine Ferraro, but it can stand for the collective wisdom of August 2000.)
Yes, Mr. Gore made his choice in defiance of lethal anti-Jewish bigots on the American fringe, from Sacramento to Crown Heights to cyberspace. And yes, polls say that 12 percent of the country is still anti-Semitic. But doesn't Pat Buchanan have those votes sewed up anyway?
I defer to a recent Hebrew school grad in my household, 16-year-old Simon: "Gore gets to prove himself risky by doing something completely unrisky -- picking a middle-of-the-road candidate like himself." His opinion was echoed by another Jew I canvassed, Woody Allen, who finds the fact that "people are knocked out of their chairs" by Mr. Lieberman's nomination "ridiculous." He adds: "It's an embarrassment for the country that it took to the year 2000" for a Jew to be on the ticket. "Everyone is saying how tolerant the country is -- they settle for so little!"
If anything, all the self-congratulatory talk this week about the tolerance of Jews is more unsettling than cheering, once it becomes clear how little many non-Jews know about us. The constant refrain -- "Could a Jewish vice president wage war on his Sabbath?" -- has never been asked so vociferously of devout Christians who might have to leave church if bombs dropped on a Sunday. "I go to an Orthodox synagogue, and do you know how many beepers go off?" says a laughing Abraham Foxman of B'nai B'rith's Anti-Defamation League, noting all the Jewish doctors who, apparently unbeknownst to most Americans, actually do whip off their prayer shawls when called upon to save lives.
Conservative Republicans, meanwhile, seem to think that one size yarmulke fits all -- that all Orthodox Jews, Mr. Lieberman included, can be patronizingly stereotyped as cultural reactionaries with views closer to Jerry Falwell's than Mr. Gore's. Writing for The Wall Street Journal, Peggy Noonan celebrated Mr. Lieberman as a blood brother to such right-wing Orthodox Jews as Dr. Laura Schlessinger. Yet the Connecticut senator shares few of the views of the anti-gay, pro-life Dr. Laura (or others named by Ms. Noonan) and is in fact to the left of the Clinton-Gore administration on "don't ask, don't tell," which he feels should be scrapped so that gays can serve openly in the military. Mr. Lieberman's cultural conservatism mainly consists of throwing occasional self-promotional press conferences with William Bennett to rail impotently against Jerry Springer.
The beauty of the Lieberman nomination for Democrats is that it calls the Republicans' bluff on their new "inclusiveness." George W. Bush may have put minorities onstage in Philadelphia, but Mr. Gore put one on the ticket. Better still for the Democrats, compassionate conservatism has such a strict code of political correctness that the Bush forces, already criticized by Jewish groups for the governor's official declaration of a "Jesus Day" in Texas this year, will never dare pick on a Jewish candidate. When Mr. Lieberman eloquently defended a woman's right to choose a so-called partial birth abortion on "Larry King Live" this week, you didn't hear any of the usual Republican cries of "infanticide." Instead the G.O.P. tried to argue that Mr. Lieberman, who had a 95 percent voting record with the liberal Americans for Democratic Action last year, was a closet Republican. Now that's chutzpah.
But just as the press gives Mr. Gore excessively high marks for doing the politically expedient thing in picking Mr. Lieberman, so it oversells Mr. Lieberman's value to Mr. Gore. The conventional media wisdom that the first Democratic senator to moralize against Monicagate will now inoculate Mr. Gore from Clinton fatigue and Clinton sleaze is beside the point, even if it were true.
"We're not choosing a preacher, we're choosing a president," said Mr. Gore in 1988, when deflecting Jesse Jackson in the primaries. Despite the biblical pandering by both tickets this year, the same still holds. If puritanical preaching against Bill Clinton's sins is such a sure winner, why did the Bush campaign lock Henry Hyde in an attic in Philadelphia last week? Why, at the height of G.O.P. moralizing against Monicagate in 1998, did the Democrats gain seats in the election? The same Washington geniuses who predicted -- with stunning unanimity and inaccuracy -- that voters would punish Mr. Clinton's party in '98 predict the same fate for Mr. Gore this year. And they're probably wrong again. Now, as then, voters dislike sanctimonious public scolds, regardless of faith or party, as much as they dislike public scoundrels. Now, as then, they know when Mr. Clinton is on the ballot and when he is not, and don't regard all Democrats as his surrogates.
The real problem for Mr. Gore this year isn't Clinton fatigue -- it's Gore fatigue. And you feel it almost every time he opens his mouth. Whether in small groups or large, on the record or off, the hyper-cautious vice president has trouble speaking plainly and candidly when trying to further his views or his candidacy. Most Americans recognize that he is both far more experienced in and knowledgeable about government than Governor Bush. Few confuse his private life with Bill Clinton's. Polls show that Americans agree with Mr. Gore's positions on most issues and love the economy. But it all may be for naught for a candidate who not only tells you how to build a watch when you ask what time it is but is still talking after you've nodded off.
A classic example was Mr. Gore's appearance on "Meet the Press" last month. Asked by Tim Russert for his visceral reaction to the photo of Elian Gonzalez at gunpoint, the vice president fudged ("I wasn't there, I didn't see exactly what happened") and droned on in the impersonal legalese of Michael Dukakis's legendary debate flub. Simple requests for his judgments of Ralph Nader and Viktor Chernomyrdin yielded evasions like "I don't really know him personally" and "I have no idea." Did Mr. Gore agree with the Supreme Court Boy Scouts decision handed down more than two weeks earlier? "I haven't read the opinion." Worse, each of these non-answers was surrounded by yards of scripted boilerplate, obfuscation or equivocation, occasionally interrupted by attempts (thankfully foiled by Mr. Russert) to introduce charts. It's not good news for Democrats that Mr. Gore is said to be writing his own acceptance speech for next week.
Joseph Lieberman, himself something of a droning orator and equivocator (including on impeachment), couldn't solve this problem even were he Sammy Davis Jr. The best any vice-presidential candidate can do is no harm. Yet Abraham Foxman says that already some worried Jews are calling the Anti-Defamation League with "what if" questions, as in, "What if the ticket loses? Will Jews be the scapegoat?"
I wouldn't lose any sleep over it. If Mr. Gore loses, it's not going to be Mr. Lieberman's fault or Mr. Clinton's fault or some anti-Semitic cabal's fault but Mr. Gore's fault. And Mr. Lieberman will have proven himself the wisest guy on the ticket anyway, by not having given up his day job in the Senate to make the race.

HEADLINE: U.S., Seeing Threat of Disease, Halts Trade in Argentine Beef

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, Aug. 11

 BODY:
The United States and Argentina have temporarily halted trade in Argentine beef because of concerns of a possible outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease here.
In statements today, the two governments called the step precautionary and said the disease did not pose a long-term threat to the growing trade in one of Argentina's most popular exports. Nevertheless, the halt in shipments is more bad news for President Fernando de la Rua in his lagging efforts to pry Argentina out of a two-year recession. 
 Argentina's quota of beef sales to the United States is 20,000 tons a year and it is lobbying hard to increase the quota. The United States refused fresh Argentine beef until 1997, when the Agriculture Department lifted a ban linked to recurrent outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease in the early part of the century.
Argentine beef has become a gastronomic fashion in much of the United States. Fed on grass rather than corn and allowed to roam on the pampas, Argentine cattle produce beef that is lean and tasty, if slightly chewy.
Nine days ago, Argentine officials found antibodies for foot-and-mouth disease in 10 head of cattle smuggled from neighboring Paraguay. Foot-and-mouth, rarely suffered by humans although they can be carriers, is a virus characterized by fever, weight loss and mouth blisters. As a precaution, the Argentine government ordered the slaughter of 3,000 head of cattle in northern Formosa, Corrientes and Entre Rios Provinces and suspended most exports of fresh beef, not only to the United States, but also to Canada, Venezuela, Central America and the Caribbean.
The government said the cattle with the antibodies were not actually sick.
After Argentina took action, the United States Department of Agriculture put a "temporary hold" on fresh, chilled or frozen Argentine beef. Cooked and canned beef imports will still be allowed in.
Agriculture Secretary Antonio Berhongaray said today that his government took Washington's action in stride. "There is no inclination on the part of the United States to prohibit the import of Argentine beef," Mr. Berhongaray said. "This was a move that was anticipated."
In a brief statement today, the American Embassy praised Argentina for taking prompt action. "As soon as this situation is resolved," the statement read, "exports of fresh beef will be able to resume."
As the fourth largest beef exporter, Argentina expected to sell 350,000 tons of beef products abroad this year. Three months ago, international monitors declared Argentine beef free of foot-and-mouth disease, a finding that officials had hoped would help them increase exports.
"Argentina made the decision to cease meat exports until the sanitary situation is resolved," the Argentine Agriculture Department said in a statement that predicted a resolution of the problem in a week.

HEADLINE: Sales Pick Up With No Sign Of Inflation

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 11

 BODY:
Retail sales rose in July at the fastest pace in five months, while prices paid to manufacturers, farmers and other producers were little changed, reports released today showed.
The combination of growth and low inflation indicated by the data confirms expectations that Federal Reserve policy makers will leave interest rates unchanged when they meet later this month. 
 "Rapid growth without any inflationary pressures will keep the Fed sidelined for many months," said Richard Yamarone, senior economist at the Argus Research Corporation in New York.
The retail sales data shows consumer spending was off to a strong start this quarter after a second-quarter slowdown, analysts said.
Sales, led by gains at auto dealers, department stores and building supply outlets, rose 0.7 percent in July after a revised 0.4 percent June increase, the Commerce Department said. The July increase in total retail sales was the largest since a 1.4 percent jump in February. Excluding auto dealers, sales rose 0.6 percent in July after a 0.3 percent June gain.
Consumer spending grew at a 3 percent annual rate in the April-June quarter after a 7.6 percent first-quarter pace, which was the strongest in 17 years.
Despite the pickup in spending, there were no signs of inflationary pressures in the Labor Department's report on producer prices.
The producer price index, a measure of prices received by producers for their goods, was unchanged. The core rate, which excludes the more volatile energy and food prices, rose 0.1 percent. In June, the overall producer index rose 0.6 percent and the core rate fell 0.1 percent.
Through July, the overall index rose at a 4.1 percent annual rate, compared with 2.1 percent in the first seven months of 1999. The core index increased at a 1.1 percent annual rate, compared with a 0.1 percent decline for the period a year earlier.
Producer energy prices fell 0.7 percent in July after rising 5.1 percent in June. The cost of gasoline fell 9.1 percent last month after rising 11.8 percent the previous month.
"Energy prices have been the big problem on the price front up until this point," said Vincent Boberski, senior economist with Dain Rauscher Inc. in Chicago, before the report. "The picture looks to be changing."
The Labor Department will release its report on consumer prices on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Missionary to England: Pakistani-Born Bishop

BYLINE: By GUSTAV NIEBUHR 

DATELINE: ROCHESTER, England

 BODY:
For centuries the Church of England's cathedral here has greeted pilgrims as the next-to-last stop on the road to Canterbury. Signs inside still bid travelers welcome, indicating the route's enduring popularity.
But these days some wonder whether Rochester's bishop might one day go to Canterbury himself -- not as a pilgrim, but as successor to the incumbent archbishop, whose retirement may not be that far off. 
 Such a move would make him the Church of England's spiritual leader, first among equals among bishops of Anglican churches worldwide, among them the Episcopal Church in the United States.
It would be a historic transition, because Rochester's prelate, Bishop Michael Nazir-Ali, is a native of Pakistan. At 50 he already has the distinction of being the only non-Caucasian in the Church of England to head a diocese.
In the last four decades, Christianity has grown rapidly in Africa and Asia, and with it the influence of African and Asian prelates. But if Europeans and Americans are to grasp the significance of the trend, it may have to be personalized through people like Bishop Nazir-Ali.
And there are several like him. There is the Rev. Setri Nyomi, the Ghanaian who is the top official of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches, which includes the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.). There is Mr. Nyomi's counterpart at the Lutheran World Federation, the Rev. Ishmael Noko, a Zimbabwean.
And there is Cardinal Francis Arinze, a Nigerian who heads the Vatican's interfaith council. Within the Roman Catholic Church, whose African membership has more than doubled since 1975, the cardinal is considered to be among Pope John Paul II's possible successors.
In an interview in his study -- a room with a fireplace, a window overlooking a garden, and many books -- the Cambridge-educated Bishop Nazir-Ali discussed his rise to influence. "I've never actually applied for anything," he said. "I've always been told to do it. I never thought I would have a ministry outside Pakistan."
His voice is heard well beyond Rochester, which lies east of London. The Guardian, a leading British newspaper, recently published an article he wrote calling attention to the persecution of Christians in some Islamic nations. In it he cited verses in the Koran supporting religious tolerance.
The son of a Christian convert, the bishop has Shiite Muslim relatives. He speaks Arabic, Persian and Urdu, and is often invited to speak in British mosques.
Bishop Nazir-Ali has had an increasingly visible presence among Anglican prelates since 1986, when Robert Runcie, then the archbishop of Canterbury, invited him to help plan the 1988 Lambeth Conference, the once-a-decade meeting of Anglican prelates worldwide.
When the bishops met again in 1998, three years after he was named to head the Rochester diocese, Bishop Nazir-Ali presided over a conference committee concerned with Christian-Muslim relations and spoke about Islam in the world. "It was a very learned talk," said Bishop Henry N. Parsley of Birmingham, Ala.
Last March, Bishop Parsley invited Bishop Nazir-Ali to lecture and preach to Alabama Episcopalians. "People in Montgomery and Birmingham were delighted," Bishop Parsley said. But asked about his colleague's ecclesiastical future, he said, "Who knows, when you're talking about the next archbishop of Canterbury or the next pope?"
Bishop Nazir-Ali has heard the speculation and, not surprisingly, is circumspect. "I carry on with what I'm doing in the way I regard as best," he said. Rochester and Canterbury, neighboring dioceses, share major social work projects.
The archbishop of Canterbury stands at the core of the British establishment, by protocol outranking even the prime minister. To live up to the job description, a prelate must function as local bishop, leader of a diverse and often divided national church, and head of a global religious association. Commenting on the responsibilities, the bishop said, "Nobody in their right mind would seek such a job."
Others mentioned as candidates include Bishop Richard Charters of London, who is considered close to the royal family, and Archbishop Rowan Williams of Wales, who is admired as a theologian.
The successor to the incumbent, Archbishop George Carey, will be chosen by members of a royal commission as well as the prime minister and Queen Elizabeth II. The decision may be years off. Archbishop Carey, who was chosen in 1991, can remain in office until he turns 70, in 2006. But he could step down sooner.
Canterbury's Christian significance dates to 597, when a missionary monk named Augustine arrived to evangelize the Anglo-Saxons. One of his colleagues ventured west to the Medway River, becoming Rochester's first bishop.
The diocese is economically varied, incorporating London's eastern flanks, agricultural areas and new towns. Dickens grew up within its boundaries. Now it contains an emerging religious diversity, with Mormons, New Age spiritualists and others, part of a wide challenge confronting the Church of England, whose problems might have daunted even Augustine.
Church attendance has fallen. Anglican leaders speak of a society awash with "pick and mix" spirituality, in which people choose beliefs and practices to suit their private needs.
To examine the church's place in this, Bishop Nazir-Ali headed a committee that published "The Search for Faith" (Church House Publishing, 1996). The book examined the history of ideas underlying contemporary thinking and suggested that the church find new ways to communicate the Gospel to a postmodern culture.
The bishop has also been quoted as saying that the British might benefit from receiving missionaries.
"Britain is a missionary situation," he said. "There's no question about that. It's a lack of even basic knowledge of the Bible in the population. I was preaching at a Charles Dickens international conference, and I was saying: Dickens was immersed in the Bible. But now when students study Dickens in university, they have to be taught the Bible to understand Dickens."
The church, he said, "needs help, in the sense of inspiration, enthusiasm, new eyes to see its mission."
It may also need self-confidence. At times members of the clergy inviting him to speak have urged him to avoid saying anything that might upset people. But he still feels, as he put it, that "the world is willing to give us a hearing, as long as we're willing to say something."
He knows reactions can be hostile. Earlier this year the bishop, who is married and has two grown sons, touched off a furor by writing that the church should continue to teach "that having children and their nurture is a basic good of marriage and not an optional extra."
One critic, representing an organization for "non-parents," called his message "too offensive for words."
But others were pleased. "That Michael would say that warmed my heart," said Bishop Munawar K. Rumalshah, the head of a London missionary society and a friend for more than 30 years.
Bishop Nazir-Ali's becoming archbishop, his old friend said, would have a big impact throughout the Anglican Communion -- would prove "that there is no black and white in Jesus."

Unconventional Mayor Steps Into Convention Spotlight

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
RICHARD J. RIORDAN is not central casting's idea of a big city mayor. He has no "How'm I doin'?" chutzpah, no big stick. He is no speechmaker and is terrible on television. Even some of his allies refer to him with a mix of affection and exasperation as "Mayor Magoo."
The other day, at a ceremony related to the opening of the Democratic National Convention, which he had worked so hard to lure, Mr. Riordan, a Republican, actually said, "I just want to say those three magic words: Welcome to the City of Angels." He once introduced the actress Tyne Daly as "Tiny." 
 But for seven years, Mr. Riordan, a multimillionaire businessman and lawyer who works for $1 a year, has presided over this city's recovery from riots, fires, earthquake and the worst recession in 50 years with implausible success. With his own money and the help of wealthy friends, he financed successful campaigns to limit the terms of local elected officials, pass a new city charter to restructure government and elect a new majority on the board of education to deal with beleaguered schools in a city where his official powers are weak and political involvement low.
"He does this, 'I'm just a country lawyer' thing, and very slick guys in blue suits screw up because they mistake that facade," said a former chief of staff, Robin Kramer. "Because there's a very capable, highly intelligent and very practical guy behind it."
For about two minutes on the convention podium on Monday, Mr. Riordan will stand in a national spotlight usually reserved for his more colorful counterparts as he welcomes Democrats. When he set out to bring the convention to town more than two years ago, Mr. Riordan had no idea that delegates would arrive in the midst of the worst police corruption scandal in decades and amid fears of disruptive street protests, but he was philosophical this week.
"I feel like a father putting on a wedding for his oldest daughter and being driven nuts," Mr. Riordan said in an interview in the City Hall conference room, surrounded by autographed photographs of President Clinton and photos of the restless, 70-year-old mayor biking and jogging. "And then at the last minute everything comes together and you have a great time. But, really, this has not been easy."
That was a typical understatement. For months, convention planning had been plagued by troubles raising money, infighting and, for a time, Mr. Riordan's inattention. Last winter, Mr. Riordan began making phone calls to raise some $5 million to cover convention costs and spent at least 10 percent of his time on planning. In the end, Terry McAuliffe, the Democrats' most prolific fund-raiser, had to step in to help raise money.
At the same time, Mr. Riordan has had to contend with the worst police corruption scandal in decades, in which rogue officers have been accused of fabricating testimony and, in at least one instance, handcuffing and shooting an unarmed man, then implicating him in a crime and watching him go to prison paralyzed from the waist down. The United States Justice Department, which was already investigating patterns of police misconduct here, has threatened a civil rights lawsuit if the city does not accept a binding agreement to make long-promised changes in officer training.
In the last year of his second term, even some longtime supporters say Mr. Riordan seems adrift. Senior aides have left, and he barely speaks to the man who was once his most trusted confidant, William M. Wardlaw, a Democratic lawyer. Mr. Riordan has not forgiven Mr. Wardlaw for backing the city attorney, James K. Hahn, a Democrat, for mayor next year, while Mr. Riordan, who built an unusual coalition of white suburban homeowners and inner-city Hispanics in the wake of the 1992 riots, favors a fellow Republican businessman, Steve Soboroff.
BUT Mr. Riordan insists he is busier than ever.
"I always say, and I really believe this, that if you start thinking about a legacy, then it takes your eye off the ball," he said.
Mr. Riordan, born in Flushing, Queens, to a father who was an executive at the department store Abraham and Strauss and a mother who was a homemaker, came to politics by a nontraditional route. After graduating from Princeton, and ranking first in his class at the University of Michigan Law School, he made a fortune in the leveraged buyout business in the 1980's. He has a longstanding interest in education, and his private foundation has given away $30 million over 20 years in support of education. He said he would like nothing better when he leaves office than to finance and become the principal of a charter school.
"He's an odd combination, because he's such a restless guy, with a short attention span, and his mind always seems to be jumping to the next thing," said Patt Morrison, a columnist for The Los Angeles Times and one of the members, including the actor Alan Alda and the sociologist James Q. Wilson, of the mayor's book club, which gathers in the 40,000-volume library at Mr. Riordan's house in Brentwood to tackle authors from Stendhal to Raymond Chandler. "And yet he takes on a great deal of serious reading," Ms. Morrison said.
Perhaps Mr. Riordan's biggest failure has been his inability to get along with the 15-member City Council, all but three of whom are Democrats.
"It's more words than reality," he said. "Some of the liberals who would like to be friendly with me are afraid, afraid they'd be thrown out of the liberal cult."

Central Bank In Japan Raises Interest Rates

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Aug. 11

 BODY:
Forcefully asserting its view that Japan's economy is now growing firmly after years of false starts, the central bank raised interest rates today for the first time in a decade, defying strong pressure from government officials to keep borrowing costs close to zero.
In what was described as a taxing all-day meeting, the Bank of Japan's nine-member board voted to abandon the zero-interest policy it had adopted in February 1999 as an emergency measure to keep the economy from slipping further into recession. 
 While the move had been widely expected, it nonetheless sent a powerful message about the central bank's view that the Japanese economy, the world's second largest, has now achieved enough momentum to keep expanding. The move also represented an unparalleled display of independence by the central bank, which had been given more autonomy under a change in the law a few years ago but until today had never exercised it.
The central bank said it would steer a benchmark rate known as the overnight call rate -- the interest rate banks charge each other -- to 0.25 percent from virtually zero.
The official discount rate, which is the largely symbolic rate on loans the central bank charges to private banks, was left unchanged at 0.5 percent, a record low.
Today was the first time since 1990 that the central bank had raised rates, which it had lowered repeatedly in response to Japan's seesaw pattern of recession and feeble recovery that characterized much of the decade.
"At present, Japan's economy is showing clearer signs of recovery, and this gradual upturn, led mainly by business fixed investment, is likely to continue," the central bank said in a statement.
The increase in the benchmark rate will lead to higher borrowing costs for consumers and businesses. Even so, the benchmark rate remains extraordinarily low in this country. The comparable rate in the United States is 6.5 percent and in Europe it is 4.25 percent.
The announcement of the rate increase here came after the close of the financial markets. The Nikkei index of 225 stocks was up 141.85 points, or 0.89 percent, to 16,117.50. The yen was little changed against the dollar. The markets were not expected to react much when they reopened on Monday.
But the central bank's decision drew sharp criticism from government officials, political leaders and many economists who have argued that Japan's economy is still too delicate to sustain an increase in interest rates, no matter how small. Many critics of the increase view it more as a statement of independence on the part of the central bank than as sound economic policy.
"I think the Bank of Japan has probably moved too soon in light of the economic situation," said Robert Alan Feldman, chief economist for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in Tokyo. "The onus is on them to demonstrate their decision was correct."
Ronald Bevacqua, senior economist for Commerz Securities in Tokyo, said the rate increase was "a brave move but not necessarily one that the economy justifies."
While Japan's economy grew 2.5 percent in the first three months of 2000 and the government projects that economic growth this fiscal year will be 1 percent, double the rate of a year earlier, Mr. Bevacqua said that Japan's growth was peaking and would slow.
The government, which early this week denounced any rate increase as premature, asked the central bank at its meeting today to postpone a decision on rates until next month, when second-quarter gross domestic product figures will be available to better assess the country's economic performance.
But the board immediately rejected the request by a majority vote, the central bank said.
At a news conference after the meeting, Masaru Hayami, the central bank's governor, stressed that the zero-rate policy had been an extraordinary measure meant to ward off deflation -- a dangerous downward spiral of prices and incomes that can lead to a full-scale depression. But Mr. Hayami said such a policy had to end at some point, and the deflation threat had passed.
Mr. Hayami has long stated the need to raise interest rates, arguing that the zero-rate policy essentially encourages nearly free borrowing that keeps unprofitable businesses from making painful cutbacks. It also hurts the incomes of Japan's growing population of retirees whose savings are barely earning interest.
In recent weeks, Mr. Hayami had conducted a public relations campaign of sorts, proclaiming the necessity of raising rates. Many analysts said he had gone too far to turn back, and one central bank board member who attended today's meeting said that Mr. Hayami had convinced most board members that it was their duty to vote for the rate increase, as a measure not only of their independence but their legitimacy.
"All economic data, ranging from corporate investment to jobs and spending have gotten better in August and July," Mr. Hayami said. "Board members took these data as proof that deflation fears have dissipated."
At its board meeting last month, the central bank had been widely expected to lift the zero-rate policy, but the collapse of a highly indebted retailer, the Sogo Company, sent shudders through the financial system and the bank decided to maintain the policy while it monitored the impact of Sogo's failure.
Analysts said the immediate impact of the rate increase would probaly be tightening of credit available to small and medium-size businesses, which will increase bankruptcies and unemployment.
Particularly vulnerable are the real estate, construction and retail sectors, which are the most heavily indebted. Higher interest rates will also make it more costly for the government to borrow money to feed the extensive spending projects that have helped keep Japan's economy from faltering even further over the last decade.
The rate increase puts Japanese banks in a particularly difficult position. The banks, which have received enormous government aid because of hundreds of billions of dollars of unpaid loans on their books, have promised that they would make more loans to small and medium-size businesses. But they will be hard pressed to keep those promises while raising their loan rates.
Reaction to the rate increase was mixed in the Japanese business community. Takashi Imai, chairman of the Nippon Steel Corporation, told the Kyodo news service that he found it difficult to understand the central bank's decision. "Given personal consumption and prices, it can hardly be said we have come to a point where we can be certain that concern for deflation is gone," he said.
But Yotaro Kobayashi, chairman of the Fuji Xerox Company, welcomed the rate increase, saying: "The Japanese economy is now in a very good shape. The decision is confirmation that concerns about deflation are gone and that the economic recovery is getting on the right track."

HEADLINE: Firestone Scrambles to Meet Demand for Replacement Tires

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
As confused consumers kept phones ringing off the hooks yesterday at dealers across the country, Bridgestone/Firestone struggled to cope with the demand for replacement tires unleashed by its recall of 6.5 million tires for sport utility vehicles.
The company said it planned to double its production of tires in the United States and to step up its imports from other plants run by Bridgestone, its Japanese parent. The domestic increases will not include a plant in Decatur, Ill., to which Firestone has traced a disproportionate number of the tire failures that led to the recall, the second biggest in its 100-year history. 
 Yesterday, dealers were still impatiently waiting for Firestone to give them a definite timetable for when replacement tires will roll in.
"Customers are calling from the time we open until the time we close, and we don't expect the calls to slow down before next week," said Scott McClain, a sales manager at S & S Tire, which runs 22 retail stores in Kentucky and also serves as wholesaler to other dealers.
The recall includes all of Firestone's ATX and ATX II tires for 15-inch wheels, as well as Wilderness tires of the same size with a Department of Transportation 10-digit designation starting with the letters VD; these latter tires are the ones made at the Decatur plant. Because most of the reported incidents involve motorists driving in hot-weather regions -- and because supplies of replacement tires are short -- the recall is being conducted in phases, starting in the Sun Belt states.
The recall, a response to reports of 46 deaths in accidents and hundreds of tire failures, has been extended to Canada and Mexico. Most tires being recalled were supplied as original equipment on Ford Explorers, the most popular sport utility vehicle.
In most cases, even dealers without replacement tires available have told customers to come in, if only to make sure that their tires are properly inflated. Firestone recommends 30 pounds per square inch; Ford has said 26 will do. Most dealers say 30 is a minimum inflation level for safety; many recommend 32 or even higher.
Mr. McClain said he spent two days this week walking through an S & S retail outlet, checking tire pressure on customers' Ford Explorers. Some were as high as 45 P.S.I. -- an overinflation level that could itself cause a tire to eventually burst -- and some as low as 20 P.S.I. "No tire is safe if you are running it underinflated at 100 miles an hour," he said. Many dealers said their customers were expressing wariness about all Firestone tires, not just those being recalled.
"When you find a bad batch of beef, you don't suddenly say that all beef from that store is bad," said Larry Morgan, who owns Morgan Tire and Auto Inc., a large dealership in Clearwater, Fla. "But a lot of people are inappropriately abusing the name Firestone when they should just be thinking of a particular Firestone product line."
Although Firestone is giving California, Arizona and other hot-weather states first priority for replacement tires, dealers in other states are unwilling to make their own customers wait. On Wednesday, when Firestone announced the recall, S & S had 3,500 Wilderness tires -- not counting any being recalled -- in stock. It has already used them up, and is almost out of similar tires from other manufacturers as well. The company has ordered 2,500 more S.U.V.-compatible tires from Goodyear, Michelin and other Firestone competitors.
Wright Tire, a large independent dealership in Anoka, Minn. that derives about 95 percent of its sales from Firestone tires, is getting more breathing room. The owner, Thomas Wright, said he got as many as 300 calls a day on Wednesday and Thursday, but that the volume had tapered off by yesterday afternoon. Mr. Wright, who is also president of the Tire Association of North America, has replaced about 30 sets of tires from stock, and has scheduled another 75 tire replacements for the future.
But in his view, customer panic is misplaced. "Probably 80 percent of the Firestone tires we've sold have gone on S.U.V.'s, many of them on Ford Explorers, and we've never had one reported problem," he said. "If you keep the tire properly inflated, it runs just fine."

HEADLINE: They've Walked a Mile in Their Shoes

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG 

 BODY:
Leslie Macpherson fumbled with her tool belt as she walked into the room crammed with wires. She had never seen so many in her life. Blue ones, white ones. Wires as thin as toothpicks, wires as thick as thumbs. Thousands of them.
In her regular management job with Verizon Communications, the country's largest local telephone company, Ms. Macpherson kept track of utilities regulations imposed by state agencies. She wore a suit and sat at a desk. She met with government officials. She wrote reports. She did not carry around pliers or orange telephone handsets. 
 But that was before the union strike began last Sunday. Ms. Macpherson is now temporarily a technician, and a technician must know her wires. In this Verizon office in Midtown Manhattan, the wires are housed in metal frames the size of a mobile home. After several days on the job, Ms. Macpherson now knows how to lay a wire to help set up a dial tone for a new customer. A dial tone! The fundamental product created and sold by Verizon and its 260,000 employees.
"I think that's fed from the switch," she said, waving toward a bundle of wires. "I think."
"These are cables," she said, pointing to a thick gray sheath. "They go underground to the cosmic frame."
Cosmic frame?
"Don't ask me about the cosmic frame," she said.
Ms. Macpherson is one of about 30,000 managers who have been filling in for more than 86,000 unionized workers at Verizon offices from Maine to Virginia, pinch-hitting on union jobs that range from answering 411 calls to fixing aerial cables.
And after several days of the work, many of them said that while they were not siding with the unions, they had a new appreciation for the work of its members.
"I have a great deal of respect for the people who do it, having done it myself," said Diana Barnes, who was transferred from the department that places advertising for Verizon to work as a directory assistance operator. "So some good comes out of bad, if management appreciates the workers more."
Both Ms. Macpherson and Ms. Barnes were sent from Verizon's New York headquarters to work at the company's largest directory assistance center in the city, on 38th Street between Second and Third Avenues in Manhattan. An informal, school's-out atmosphere had descended on the place. Offices usually bustling with a dozen people were staffed by one or two managers. Fill-in workers sauntered in wearing jeans and sneakers. Supervisors who usually sat at desks ran around the hallways with tools, doing double duty as bosses and the bossed.
Of course, union workers have been less than thrilled with managers filling their jobs. They are represented by the Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. The police have received reports of egg throwing and vandalism. On a recent afternoon, several people in a picket line outside the 38th Street building yelled at a woman walking in through the front doors.
"No, don't go in there," shouted Arthur Treisman, a telephone operator waving a union placard. "Don't go in there! Scab!"
Miguel Garrido, a technician picketing alongside Mr. Treisman, said he felt insulted that managers were working union jobs.
"I think none of them are qualified to do what we do," Mr. Garrido said. "Most of them were educated in college, but they're not technically inclined."
While union shifts are usually eight hours, most managers have been working 12-hour days to compensate for the short staff. After 13 days, if the strike lasts that long, they are to get a one-day break.
"Realistically, the work out of this office is tremendous, and we do the best we can with what we have," said Deborah Torruellas, who supervised Ms. Macpherson and other frame technicians. "Over the long term, one would see a negative change, because the people here are working 12 hours a day, seven days a week, and it just won't do."
Ms. Torruellas has been with the company for 22 years, working her way up through half a dozen departments to become a manager. When her 38 frame technicians went on strike, she was forced to train eight managers from other parts of the company to do their jobs. The new recruits had to learn in hours what it sometimes took months to master, she said.
The strike has also meant that Ms. Torruellas had to strap on a tool belt and work on the frames herself, something she had not done regularly for a decade. "At least I'm off my desk and on the floor," she said.
Most of the jobs that needed filling were operator positions. Three floors above Ms. Torruellas, about 30 people sat in gray cubicles wearing headsets. The calls for directory assistance came in one after another, an endless stream of questions.
Robert Shapiro was trying to type the word "coronet" into his computer. A caller wanted the number of the movie theater by that name. Mr. Shapiro tapped out the letters slowly.
"Spell it for me," he told his caller. "I'm a manager here. I don't have typing skills."
Mr. Shapiro usually manages computer programmers developing Verizon's e-commerce systems in a White Plains office. But on this day he wore the shackles of the old economy. In his operator's cubicle he would sit for 12 hours, with only three breaks -- 30 minutes for lunch and two 15-minute periods. He had taken his shoes off. On his desk sat an apple, a cookie and a bottle of water.
Mr. Shapiro, who also worked as an operator during the last strike, which lasted for two days in 1998, has been averaging 900 calls in a 12-hour shift. (A trained directory assistance operator takes more than 1,000 calls in an eight-hour shift.) During a recent five-minute period, callers asked Mr. Shapiro for the numbers of a pizzeria, a doughnut shop, a pharmacy, the United Parcel Service and a jeweler in Manhattan named Gumuchjian Fils.
"It really gives you an appreciation of the work that the union folks do," he said. "It's invaluable."
Three floors below, Ms. Macpherson pulled out her pliers and stared at the wires snaking over the metal girders. So many wires! During the last strike, at least, she had been able to hit the road for two days as a delivery driver. But it could be worse, she said, shaking her head as she thought about the managers who had to work as operators.
"I'm O.K. with this," she said. "I'm not complaining."

HEADLINE: Czech Police and Army Get Ready for Protests at I.M.F.-World Bank Meeting

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: PRAGUE, Aug. 11

 BODY:
Kentucky Fried Chicken and Pizza Hut have already ordered replacement glass. So has Tesco, a British supermarket chain, and it is thinking of shutting down for the duration. McDonald's talks hopefully of its local ownership and wants to keep its outlets open.
The Interior Ministry will have 11,000 police officers on duty, with several thousand troops in reserve. Schools and theaters will close. The ministry has even opened a Web site, warning young people, "The police will have a lot of work on their hands, so they cannot be too tolerant of various childish pranks." It adds, "Do not provoke the police." 
 It advises older people to stock up on food and medicine, and to "relax and trust the authorities."
One might think that these are preparations for the battle in Central Europe that NATO war-gamed for so many years. But it is only the annual autumn meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, a conference that the Czech Republic eagerly sought in 1993 as a millennial symbol of the country's return to capitalism and the West.
The 10-day meeting, which is expected to attract up to 18,000 officials and delegates, opens on Sept. 19. The Communists' old Palace of Culture has been renovated for the meeting at a cost of $60 million and renamed the Congress Center.
But since Prague sought this honor, the monetary fund and the World Bank have become targets of rage against globalization and indifferent capitalism. The fund in particular has for some the same negative connotations that the Federal Emergency Management Agency has for far-right groups in the United States.
Already, on various Web sites critical of the fund and its policies, like www.destroyimf.org -- "a Web resource for all those mobilizing to end the poverty and injustice inflicted by global capitalism" -- there is the cry, "Turn Prague into Seattle!" There, late last November, 40,000 demonstrators paralyzed the city, damaged businesses, clashed with the police and tied up a meeting of the World Trade Organization.
Organizers and Czech officials expect 20,000 to 50,000 protesters -- some peaceful, some not -- to come here. The protests will certainly be the largest here since 1989, and perhaps the largest invasion of foreigners since the Soviets dropped by with their tanks in 1968.
President Vaclav Havel has tried to satisfy and perhaps co-opt some of the more well-mannered groups by offering to meet with them at Prague Castle.
The government has offered designated areas for protest and arranged for a private company, FAM, to equip the old Strahov sports stadium with tents, portable lavatories and food so the protesters will have a relatively clean and safe place to stay.
The tent city will open on Sept. 21, and anyone may stay there for the duration for $37, said Tomas Doubek of FAM. There will be private security guards but no policemen, unless there is significant trouble.
But the conservative party of former Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus objected to the arrangements, saying they looked as if the Czechs "are collaborating with extremists," Mr. Doubek said.
"Some legislators said, 'Let the protesters get a doctorate in finance, learn two foreign languages, work in a bank for a few years, and then they will be qualified to discuss I.M.F. issues,' " he said. "Surprisingly, nobody laughed at this stupidity."
Alice Dvorska, an organizer with the Czech umbrella group Initiative against Economic Globalization, says she is worried about how the Czech police, with a history of aggressive crowd control, will behave.
In May 1998 the police were taken by surprise by protests against the automobile industry and globalization. The police beat some protesters and some bystanders as well.
"We're afraid of violence on the part of the police," Ms. Dvorska said. "The Interior Ministry is purposely demonizing us. If you look at protests around the world, it is always the police who cause most of the violence."
Chelsea Mozen is a 25-year-old American who quit a job in Washington to help organize the initiative's program of nonviolent demonstrations, dance and street theater intended to educate citizens.
"It's not our main aim to shut the meeting down, although we think the I.M.F. and World Bank should be dissolved," Ms. Mozen said. "We want a grass-roots display of our disagreement."
But she says the police have been monitoring the group and its planning, including a meeting outside Prague last month. "We're definitely under surveillance," she said.
On Aug. 2 the group handed out fliers and performed a bit of street theater in Old Town Square, holding a symbolic soccer match between multinational corporations and representatives of the world's poor. The corporations won by bribing the referee, who represented the I.M.F. and the World Bank.
Chuck Reinhardt, a high school teacher from New York, played the part of McDonald's during the match. "The World Bank is not accountable," he said. "They give out loans but don't bear responsibility for what is being done with the money, and most people around the world get no benefits from it at all."
Ragnhild Eide Skogseth, 18, a Norwegian student who played Shell Oil, said the fund and the bank "always say they want to help the poor, but the results are always the opposite."
The Czech police have been training for the meeting and have worked with the American police and with the F.B.I., which has opened an office in Prague, mostly to monitor organized crime.
The F.B.I. trained 24 Czech police officers in crowd control in the United States, said an Interior Ministry spokesman, Stanislav Gross, and the police have paid particular attention to the way the Washington, D.C., police handled the spring meeting of the fund and the bank in April. Hundreds of protesters were arrested there, but there was much less violence than in Seattle.
Still, for the designers of the Web site, the meeting "will be protected by a Czech police operation run by the F.B.I." It says, "The challenge to the workers' movement is to shut down that summit with the biggest international demo Europe has ever seen."
One problem for the police is the location of the old Palace of Culture. The main access from the city center, where most delegates will stay, is by a bridge over a valley that could be blocked by protest.
The two closest hotels, the Corinthia Forum and the Panorama, are on the right side of the bridge, but because they have Libyan ownership, an American embargo would bar Americans from staying there.
Horst Kohler, the fund's executive director, says he has "full confidence" in Prague's ability to handle the meeting. Emphasizing a need for "internal reform," he said the fund was "open for discussions and dialogue."
"We're not hiding" from the protesters, he said.
Mr. Havel emphasizes the symbolism of Prague as the host of the post-Communist world's first annual meeting of the fund and bank. He said he would try to have discussions with the demonstrators as well as the bankers.
The media attention given to security issues "pains me," he said. "It seems as if we are preparing for civil war. We should take this more positively."

HEADLINE: John C. Harsanyi, 80, Is Dead; Won Nobel Economics Award

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
John C. Harsanyi, who won the 1994 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science for his work on game theory, died on Wednesday in Berkeley, Calif.
Mr. Harsanyi, 80, was a professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California at Berkeley, for 25 years until 1990. He had Alzheimer's disease and died of a heart attack at home in Berkeley, according to his son, Tom. 
 A Hungarian of Jewish descent, Mr. Harsanyi barely escaped from the forced-labor unit he was drafted into outside Budapest near the end of World War II. While waiting at a crowded railway station to be deported to a mine, Mr. Harsanyi removed his sweater with its yellow star and walked away, his son said.
A guard stopped him and asked him what he was doing there. Mr. Harsanyi, according to his son, said: "I am here to visit one of my Jewish friends who is going to be deported. I think it is important that we stand by our friends in their time of need." The guard let him go. Tom Harsanyi said that of the workers in the forced- labor unit, only his father and three others, who jumped from the train, survived.
Mr. Harsanyi won the Nobel award for his work in game theory, which concentrates on competition among players, using mathematics to forecast the outcome of games, like chess, and also trade wars, hostile takeovers, price wars and other political and economic conflicts. Unlike theories used to explain the interaction in a market of many participants, game theory deals with the fact that when there are just a few players, all of them have to worry about the response of their opponent.
Mr. Harsanyi shared the award with two other economists, John F. Nash of Princeton University and Reinhard Selten of the University of Bonn. Mr. Nash laid out the basic principles of game theory, but he assumed that the players all shared the same information and were driven by self-interest. Mr. Harsanyi made the theory work when rivals did not know much at all about what the other planned to do. He did this, in part, by assigning probabilities to the possible moves of the players and the outcomes.
"He found a way to allow people to think systematically about markets in which there were a small number of players who had access to different information," said John Quigley, a professor of economics at Berkeley and the former chairman of the economics department.
"For a large set of circumstances, game theory is the way people think today," Mr. Quigley said. Mr. Harsanyi's work, Mr. Quigley added, "was instrumental in making economic theory fit the imperfect world in which we live."
Mr. Harsanyi was born in Budapest on May 29, 1920. His parents were Jewish but converted to Catholicism before he was born. He was raised as a Catholic. His main interests were in mathematics and philosophy. But because of the political uncertainty of the time, he earned a degree in pharmacology so that he could work in his father's pharmacy. He was drafted into the forced-labor unit after Germany occupied Hungary during World War II.
After the war, Mr. Harsanyi remained in Hungary, earning a doctorate in philosophy from the University of Budapest. He was an assistant professor of sociology at the univeristy until the late 1940's, when his views clashed with those of the Communist government. He quit his job and returned to work in his father's pharmacy.
In 1950, he escaped over the border to Austria with his future wife, Anne, and traveled to Australia. He married Anne on Jan. 2, 1951, three days after arriving in Sydney.
He went to the University of Sydney at night to earn a master's degree in economics and became a lecturer in economics at the University of Queensland in Brisbane in 1954. But his son, Tom, said that his father felt that he could not be effective in his field from Australia. So in 1956, he enrolled in the Ph.D. program in economics at Stanford University and studied under Kenneth Arrow, a future Nobel winner in economics.
He returned to Australia to teach economics at the Australian National University from 1958 to 1961 and then returned to the United States to Wayne State University in Detroit from 1961 to 1963. He went to the Haas School at Berkeley in 1964 as a visiting professor and became a full professor in 1965. He was appointed a professor in the Berkeley economics department in 1966.
In 1964, before Mr. Harsanyi developed his procedure for dealing with game theory players with incomplete information, he was asked to be one of 10 game theorists to advise the United States Arms Control and Disarmament Agency on negotiations with the Soviet Union. The 10 advisers said they could not help because both "players" had too little information about the other side.
Mr. Harsanyi is survived by his wife, Anne, of Berkeley, and his son, of Somerville, Mass.

HEADLINE: Bingo, Blood and Burial Plots In the Quest for Food Stamps

BYLINE: By NINA BERNSTEIN 

 BODY:
In California, New York and 27 other states, people applying for food stamps are asked if they own a burial plot. Nebraska and Nevada want to know if applicants have sold their blood, and for how much. Hawaii demands garage-sale receipts, South Dakota wants documentation of bingo winnings, and Minnesota, on Page 20 of a 36-page eligibility application, asks if anyone in the household earns money from a paper route.
Food-stamp applications in most states have become so onerous that they are deterring needy people from applying for the subsidies, a comprehensive analysis by a national network of food banks and advocacy groups has found. Many of the inquiries about income and assets have no connection to legal requirements for stamps but are either aggressive responses to federal mandates to deter fraud or part of recent state and local efforts to cut welfare costs by eliminating recipients. 
 State administrators contend that they are simply complying with federal pressure to be tightfisted with taxpayers' money and properly enforcing the tougher rules passed by Congress in the 1996 welfare overhaul.
But federal officials say the report, conducted by America's Second Harvest, the nation's largest food bank network, adds to their worries that such stringency may be one reason that 12 million people who need the benefits, and are eligible, are not getting them.
Food-stamp use is plummeting at a faster rate than can be explained by economic growth. Since 1996, the number of people using food stamps has declined to 17.2 million people from 23 million, though a growing bipartisan consensus now holds that food stamps, like Medicaid, are supports needed to keep low-wage parents working.
"Sometimes in this program we have not looked at the big picture," Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said in an interview about the survey, which will be released on Monday.
"It's not my goal to keep hungry people out of the program -- that's a disgrace," Mr. Glickman said. "But it's also my job to keep fraud down. It's tricky to balance those things."
The report, he added, "is actually helpful. We are going to continue to work with the states to make sure that the income limits aren't ridiculous," and that antifraud techniques are not "outside the bounds of what we ought to be doing."
Among the new sleuthing methods for countering fraud are parking-lot espionage in Tennessee, computerized credit checks in Delaware and Texas, and calls to employers and landlords in Alaska.
"They don't want you to have nothing," a disabled woman of 56, who asked that her name not be used, whispered as she peered at the question about a burial space in the shabby waiting room of a food-stamp office in Harlem. "It's none of their business. You want to tell the truth, but they make it so if you tell the truth, it don't help."
When the comment was repeated to the sponsors of the study, which examined application forms from all 50 states and a sampling from the nation's 3,143 counties, they said it underlined the unfairness of such questions, though they are not illegal.
"She's afraid she'll go hungry if she's honest," Deborah Leff, president of America's Second Harvest, said of the woman's concern. "Isn't that a mess?"
Though the federal government finances and oversees the food-stamp program, states administer it, with wide variations. The shortest application, in Florida, is only a page, but most are more than 10 pages, and all warn that misleading answers are punishable by a stiff fine and up to 20 years in prison.
Yet, the study found, many questions are unintelligible to the average applicant, and some are mind-boggling even to the researchers.
"Are you or anyone in your household fleeing from New Jersey?" Ohio's eight-page application asks. Researchers nicknamed the query the Soprano Clause, after the television drama about a Mafia family.
"We live in Cleveland," said Sharon Davis, 39, a single mother of three who was laid off last month from her job as a machine operator and had spent most of the afternoon applying for food stamps. "Why would they ask if you're from New Jersey?"
In their defense, state administrators contend that all the questions -- including that one -- reflect local efforts to comply with a stream of federal dictates, including periodic crackdowns on fraud, stiff penalties on states that overpay even by $5, and new rules in the 1996 federal welfare legislation.
To explain the so-called Soprano Clause, for example, Ohio food-stamp administrators pointed to a provision by Congress in the 1996 legislation. It excludes from the food-stamp program any fugitive from prosecution of a felony, which in New Jersey is called a "high misdemeanor." To be safe, said Jon Allen, a spokesman for the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services, Ohio added an extra question just to cover New Jersey's terminology.
By the same token, Nebraska, which was fined $1 million for food-stamp errors in a 1998 federal audit, asks about money from blood plasma donations and counts it against a family's food allotment -- which food-bank analysts say is simply wrong -- because in 1986 an obscure federal policy memorandum defined such money as earned income.
As for burial plots, some state administrators justify questioning elderly applicants about them because a federal provision notes that only one grave per customer can be discounted when calculating a household's assets. To be eligible for food stamps at all, a household cannot have assets of over $2,000, or $3,000 for senior citizens, including checking and savings accounts and the value of any car above $4,650.
Recent studies show that some people seeking food stamps have been turned away or cut off in a push to divert them from welfare -- sometimes illegally, as a federal court found in New York City last year. Many other people either do not know they are eligible or are discouraged by the requirements, especially in states that shortened eligibility to three months instead of a year, which is allowed by federal rules.
Applications take an average of five hours and two visits, Agriculture Department figures show, and the benefit, only $73 a month per person on average, can be as low as $10. Ninety percent of households getting food stamps have income under the poverty line, or $14,150 for a family of three. Three-quarters have no countable assets. A typical family of three leaving the welfare rolls has an annual income of $11,500, according to one study, and qualifies for just under $150 a month in food stamps.
Though many longer applications include questions relating to cash assistance and medical benefits, a recent study in Western and Southern states found that 78 percent of those seeking food stamps were not told when they qualified for the other programs.
Agriculture Department officials are now urging outreach efforts, and this year, for the first time, they are offering modest rewards to states that increase participation. But state administrators see a certain hypocrisy in the new thrust.
"The only message we have heard for years is accuracy; your error rate is what matters," Ann Sessoms, Minnesota's welfare reform manager, said. "If you miss a plasma donation, if you miss a paper route, the state is held liable."
Only last September the Agriculture Department's quality-control arm praised the Tennessee Department of Human Services' "Project Parking Lot," in which Nashville investigators patrol for cars whose blue-book value exceeds the $4,650 limit. They feed the license plate numbers into a computer listing people on the benefit rolls, and have cut off $3 million to $4 million in benefits as a result, according to Larry Evitts, the director of investigations.
"That's crazy," said Stephanie Manning, who oversees a Nashville food pantry that limits aid to three boxes of groceries every six months. "You can't eat your car."
Mike Harris, administrator of food stamps in Nebraska, said the dollar limit on cars, raised only by $150 since Congress set it 20 years ago, shows how states get stuck enforcing obsolete regulations.
"You know what's happened to the price of cars," Mr. Harris said. "It's like, come on, people!"
In the latest enforcement trend, 11 states, including New York, Connecticut and New Jersey, either require electronic fingerprinting of food-stamp recipients or are planning it. Texas has contracted with computer information brokers who provide, among other tidbits, a listing of 10 neighbors who could be asked about an applicant's circumstances. Delaware pays $2 or $3 an inquiry for credit-card histories on applicants whose answers seem suspicious to a caseworker. Though privacy laws make it illegal to use credit information in a criminal case, William Garfinkel, director of audit at the Delaware Department of Health and Social Services, said that nothing barred using it to determine government benefits.
"They count everything," Anna Santana, a divorced bookkeeper in Lincoln, Neb., said, citing a $25 gift certificate from her church for her three children's Christmas presents.
Before qualifying for food stamps, she added, there were times when she fed them first, and ate only if they left something. But her older daughter, then 5, caught on.
"She started cutting back on what she was eating," Ms. Santana recalled. " 'I'm not hungry, Mommy, you need to eat, too.' "
Mr. Glickman said some state actions seemed overzealous, Congressional mandates notwithstanding. "The irony here is that we don't ask farmers to do anything like we do our food-stamp recipients," he added, referring to federal farm subsidies.
A few states stand out in the study as exceptions. Indiana, for example, has a two-page application that does not ask about burial plots, bingo or blood products. Federal audits last year found fewer mistakes in its calculations of benefits than in those of California, which squeezes 120 questions onto 21 pages. Indeed, the study found that there was no correlation at all between the length of a state's application and the accuracy of its payments.
"Some states have shown a lot of good judgment and simplicity in complying with the requirements," Mr. Glickman said. "Other states have gone down a much more complicated route. Our job is to try to help all the states run a simpler system."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE PRESIDENT;
The Gore Balancing Act: Embracing Clinton While Standing on His Own

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE with MARC LACEY 

DATELINE: NASHVILLE, Aug. 11

 BODY:
For months now, Al Gore has been searching for the proper degree of separation from Bill Clinton. He has used measured words and occasional policy differences both to try to distance himself from the president and to demonstrate that he is his own man, worthy of the presidency in his own right.
At the same time, he has hoped to benefit from his participation in an administration that has presided over the longest economic expansion in history. 
 But in an ultimate twist, it seems that Mr. Gore may have to rely on the very man he is distancing himself from to make his case.
The Gore campaign is planning a multistage separation process over the next few days, although there are still internal debates over some details and how explicit Mr. Clinton should be in talking about his personal behavior and impeachment when he addresses the convention on Monday night.
That process may have begun prematurely with Mr. Clinton's comments on Thursday, when he said in a lengthy public confessional that voters should not hold Mr. Gore accountable for Mr. Clinton's sins.
"Surely, no fair-minded person would blame him for the mistakes I've made," Mr. Clinton said in an interview with a pastor in Illinois.
Gore advisers have been frustrated over the months with some of Mr. Clinton's moves that were intended to be helpful but often upstaged Mr. Gore. But they said today that Mr. Clinton's most recent comments could help the vice president -- because they expected the light to shine brightly on Mr. Clinton at this point anyway.
"We have known for the last four months that the first few days of the ramp-up into our convention was in large measure going to be about Bill Clinton and the last eight years," said a top Gore adviser. "To do it any other way would be frankly ungracious and not politically smart."
But such is the entangled relationship between the president and vice president -- and such is the admiration for Mr. Clinton's political skills -- that questions were raised about whether the White House and the Gore campaign had actually planned Mr. Clinton's remarks as a way for Mr. Clinton to give Mr. Gore some breathing space, even if they dredged up the unpleasantness that led to the impeachment.
Both camps said no. Joe Lockhart, the president's spokesman, said Mr. Clinton arranged the interview with his pastor and did not clear it with the Gore campaign.
The Gore adviser said the same thing. "I have no idea whether Clinton's remarks were spontaneous or premeditated," he said. "But they were not coordinated."
But much of the distancing dance that will take place in the next few days has been planned. Mr. Gore has given Mr. Clinton the starring prime-time role at the convention on Monday. Both sides are envisioning not only a celebration of Mr. Clinton's glory years but a clear signal that his problems are of his own making and should not be used against Mr. Gore.
One Democrat close to Mr. Clinton said the president might have used his confessional interview on Thursday as a kind of rehearsal for the convention speech. "He's trying out the show in New Haven before he gets to Broadway," the Democrat said.
The Gore campaign said Mr. Clinton will not be so explicit at the convention, and White House officials agreed, adding that Mr. Clinton used the forum on Thursday as more of a pre-emptive cleansing so he would not have to do that at the convention. In any case, Gore advisers are focused on other things. "Clinton has great job performance ratings and terrible personal ratings," one aide said. "The whole trick here is to try to be associated with the job performance."
On Tuesday, a symbolic passing of the torch from Mr. Clinton to Mr. Gore has been arranged in Michigan.
The Clinton Question has been swirling around the Gore candidacy for months, and Mr. Gore has dealt with it in various ways. He began his campaign in June 1999 with his strongest comments to date about Mr. Clinton's affair, but he seemed genuinely surprised along the campaign trail to be asked about the president. Finally, he figured out a fairly formulaic answer, which he has more or less followed for months.
He told audiences that his relationship with Mr. Clinton consisted of four parts. As he put it in January to New Hampshire Public Radio: "First of all, we're friends, and that friendship is genuine. Secondly, I have been critical of the personal mistake that the president made, which I've been asked about from time to time in this campaign. Third, I have fought alongside the president for this strong economy and for the other improvements that we've seen during the Clinton/Gore administration. And fourth, I have to win this race on my own."
"Now," he continued, "depending upon the question that's asked or the perspective of the questioner, they may focus on one of those four aspects of the relationship and not really hear the complexity of it with all four, and if they hear only that I'm running on my own, they may say, 'Oh, he's distancing himself.' If they hear I fought with President Clinton for a strong economy, they may say, 'Oh, he's embracing President Clinton.' Well, all of those things are true, but it's not true that I'm either distancing myself from him or that I am trying to run as a derivative candidate. So it's a complex relationship, just as most human relationships are."
Gore advisers acknowledge that this is an important week for the Clinton/Gore relationship. And they acknowledge that Mr. Gore's selection of a running mate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, who was the first Democratic senator to openly chastise Mr. Clinton for his behavior, was part of the larger process of trying to inoculate himself against Mr. Clinton's behavior.
For his part, Mr. Clinton, who arrived in Los Angeles today for Mr. Gore's nominating convention, is charting his own course in how a president ought to hand off the baton. He has already broken with the tradition of past presidents who arrived just as the conventions for their vice presidents were set to begin.
At Los Angeles International Airport, a reporter shouted to Mr. Clinton that his vice president was concerned that the president was overshadowing him. Mr. Clinton tilted his head back, laughed and said: "I've never heard him say that."
While Mr. Clinton is attending several galas in his honor, aides said the president would spend much of his time polishing his speech. Mr. Clinton intends to give a valedictory address that is shorter than former President Reagan's 53-minute speech in New Orleans but just as focused on making the case for 12 years of one-party rule. As is the custom, the White House has shared early drafts of the speech with Mr. Gore. White House officials have told the Gore campaign there will be no surprises.
Reviewing the hubbub over the day and Mr. Clinton's comments, Gore advisers said all the media's roiling and roar over the Clinton-Gore relationship today was nothing new, at least for the Gore campaign. Said one, "It's just another day at the office."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE ECONOMY;
News on Budgets, Homeownership and Jobs Is Wonderful, but It Isn't Helping Gore Yet

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 11

 BODY:
With less than three months until Election Day, Vice President Al Gore faces a crucial and perplexing question: why does his presidential campaign not seem to be benefiting from an economy that is as good as it gets?
Heading into the Democratic National Convention next week in Los Angeles, Mr. Gore can point to an array of indicators that would seem to work powerfully to the advantage of the incumbent party in the White House, especially when today's economic conditions are compared with those that the Clinton administration inherited seven and a half years ago. 
Unemployment is down to levels not seen in a generation. Incomes and homeownership are up. Budget deficits have given way to huge surpluses, and the stock market has generated staggering wealth.
It may be too early to count the economy out as a big factor in Mr. Gore's favor. But so far, prosperity's glow has done little for him.
Not only has he trailed Gov. George W. Bush of Texas in nearly every national poll for months, but his efforts to portray himself as a superior steward of the economy have also fallen flat.
A New York Times/CBS News Poll last month found that 75 percent of voters said they believed Mr. Gore was likely to keep the economy strong if elected president, compared with 71 percent for Mr. Bush, a statistical dead heat. Asked which candidate would do a better job of managing the economy, respondents in a Business Week/Harris Poll last month favored Mr. Bush by 51 percent to 33 percent.
"At the moment, the economy is not cutting for Gore as much as I would like," said Al From, president of the Democratic Leadership Council, a group of centrist Democrats.
Political analysts and officials of both parties said Mr. Gore might have hurt himself to a degree by failing to stick to a simple, consistent message about the economy, especially during the spring, when he veered into issues like the Elian Gonzalez case. And they said Mr. Bush had artfully tried to shift the debate from who gets credit for prosperity to what should be done with it.
But they said the real difficulty for Mr. Gore might be that times had been good for so long that voters took prosperity for granted.
"Al Gore's biggest problem on the economy is that this recovery has been going on much longer than any previous recovery," said Robert B. Reich, who served as labor secretary in President Clinton's first term. "It's become almost background noise, and people assume the good economy will just keep on rolling."
Not only do voters show little willingness to grant credit to Mr. Gore, analysts said, but the electorate also does not see either candidate as having much control over an economy that seems increasingly driven by technological advances, globalization and other forces beyond the control of any administration.
"In the economy we're in now, the public doesn't buy the idea that the economy is good because of the Clinton-Gore administration, and they'd be just as disinclined to credit the Republican Congress," said Mickey Edwards, a former Republican congressman from Oklahoma who is now a professor at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard.
Still, experience suggests that when Election Day rolls around, a fat and happy electorate is likely to think hard before throwing an incumbent party out of the White House.
Some analysts -- as well as Mr. Gore's aides -- point to the last time a sitting vice president ran for president with a strong economy at his back -- in 1988, when Governor Bush's father faced Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts. For most of the summer, Mr. Bush was behind despite nearly six years of steady economic expansion and an unemployment rate that had been halved, to 5.4 percent, since 1982.
A Gallup poll in June 1988 showed Mr. Dukakis ahead by 52 percent to 38 percent, and when asked which candidate would do a better job keeping the country prosperous, voters ranked the candidates evenly at around 40 percent. But by November, Mr. Bush had a 52-to-35 advantage on economic management in the Gallup poll, and he won the election comfortably.
"History says that people's perceptions of a sitting vice president's capability with regard to the economy can change," said Andrew Kohut, a pollster who is director of the Pew Research Center for People and the Press.
Mark Fabiani, Mr. Gore's deputy campaign manager for communications, said most voters had not yet focused on the election, and that when they did, they would conclude that Mr. Gore had supported and shaped the policies that had brought the economy to where it was and that his approach was more prudent than his rival's.
And he said Mr. Gore would seek to link Governor Bush's economic plans to those of his father, who presided over a recession that contributed to his defeat in 1992.
"People in the end will focus on the economy as the most important issue, and in the end will focus on whether we're on the right economic track and whether they are better off than they were four or eight years ago," Mr. Fabiani said. "The answers to those questions are good for Gore and bad for Bush."
If anything, Mr. Gore is emphasizing the economy more as the campaign progresses, using a message that has two distinct components.
One is unabashedly populist, and is aimed in part at the party's liberal base and at people who do not feel that they have fully benefited from the boom. It is built around the assertion -- challenged by Republicans -- that Mr. Bush's economic platform amounts to tax cuts for the wealthy, an overhaul of Social Security that would leave the retirement security of working people at risk and deference to powerful special interests like oil and pharmaceutical companies.
The other is a promise to continue the policies of fiscal responsibility that helped bring about budget surpluses and reduced interest rates. This portion of his message is intended to emphasize continuity with one of the most successful elements of Mr. Clinton's record and to appeal to moderate swing voters.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE BENEFACTORS;
Moving Heaven and Earth For the City of Angels

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Aug. 11

 BODY:
He helped lead the charge to lure the Democratic National Convention. He helped finish the fund-raising for a grand new concert hall. He helped recruit the new school superintendent. He founded one art museum and has plans to vastly expand another, and to revive a historically anemic downtown. He's the mayor's best friend, and helped bankroll campaigns to elect a new school board and pass a new city charter. And, oh, did we mention, he's the richest man in town, worth more than $5 billion?
Almost every sphere of civic life in Los Angeles these days bears the fingerprints of one soft-spoken, silver-haired 67-year-old man: Eli Broad, chairman and chief executive of Sun America Inc., the financial services and investment giant that for most of the 1990's was the fastest-growing company on the New York Stock Exchange. 
 The Bronx-born son of Lithuanian Jewish immigrants who began his career at 21 as the youngest certified public accountant in Michigan history, then developed a home-building empire that stretched from Detroit to Los Angeles, Mr. Broad has in the last few years become his adopted city's ultimate go-to guy.
As the Democrats arrive next week, Mr. Broad (rhymes with road) will be front and center to welcome them, though perhaps not as front and center as he wished. He did not get either the speaking slot at the convention or the skybox at the Staples Center that he had asked for. (He will have to share one of three skyboxes with the local host committee, of which he is a co-chairman and to which he gave $1 million while helping raise several times that.)
But Mr. Broad, and his supporters and critics alike, are quick to agree that he has flourished in Los Angeles as he could have in few other cities, if any, where tradition, schools, clubs and old-boy networks matter more and moxie and money matter less.
"It's very simple," Mr. Broad said as the afternoon sun filtered over a broad swath of Beverly Hills outside his office window. "It's a meritocracy. You can come here without the right family background, which I don't have, the right religion, the right political affiliation, and if you're willing to reach out and really work and spend your time, energy and sometimes your money, you're accepted. That's not true of most other cities in the world or North America.
"And that's one of the reasons I love the city, because it's allowed me to do all this."
Former Commerce Secretary Mickey Kantor, who has known him since they worked on Alan Cranston's campaign for the United States Senate more than 30 years ago, said Mr. Broad "is making a herculean effort to fill a vacuum" in Los Angeles's civic leadership.
"When he does something, he does it all out," Mr. Kantor said. "Most of the time he succeeds. Sometimes he does not. But the fact is that some people, whether they are threatened by it or resent it, are irritated by anyone who pushes that hard and demands action. He does not sit around and suffer inaction."
Mayor Richard J. Riordan, a Republican businessman who has recruited Mr. Broad, a lifelong Democrat, to help in innumerable civic causes, finds a more mischievous way to describe his friend's bluntness: "Eli knows nothing about foreplay."
The convention is a case in point. Mr. Broad was among a handful of people who wanted the chance to show off the city's recovery from the fires, earthquake, riots and recession of the early 1990's, and was one of the original co-chairmen of the local host committee, which pledged to finance the convention by raising more than $35 million and to use city money only for typically municipal services like transportation and security.
Los Angeles got the convention, but ever since has had trouble raising the promised money. And Mr. Broad has complained publicly and privately that at least one of his fellow co-chairmen, the record and movie mogul David Geffen, failed to put up any of his own.
Andy Spahn, Mr. Geffen's chief political aide, said Mr. Geffen had made clear from the beginning that he would help bring the convention to Los Angeles but intended to direct his fund-raising and contribution efforts to the actual electing of Democrats, beginning with Vice President Al Gore.
"This is a case of no good deed going unpunished," Mr. Spahn said.
But bad blood and embarrassing headlines have lingered for months.
"What happened?" Mr. Broad said of the controversy. "I'll tell you what happened. I got all the press, that's what happened. And why did I get all the press? I was there."
Every city has a cadre of civic leaders who support the elected government, raise money for cultural institutions and charitable causes, and offer private advice to public figures. In the 1950's and 60's, Los Angeles itself had the Committee of 25, a shadowy conclave of businessmen who helped pick candidates for appointment or election to public office and generally set the tone in the city until the Watts riots set off changes in the municipal power structure.
But with a shift in the region's economy from large, home-grown industries like aerospace to multimedia conglomerates, with a wave of mergers and acquisitions that have left downtown Los Angeles lacking a headquarters of a single Fortune 500 company, and with his own considerable ambition, Mr. Broad has emerged as a virtual committee of one, or, as he puts it, a venture philanthropist.
That has not always endeared him to some officials and fellow billionaires here, who complain -- invariably under cloak of anonymity -- that he is too quick to claim credit, too willing to hog the spotlight, too wrapped up in his own pet projects.
"I've got a big ego," Mr. Broad said matter-of-factly in a recent interview in his 38th-floor headquarters in a Century City office tower. "I like to be thought of well."
But Mr. Broad is also something of a rarity in an age of handlers and spin doctors, consultants and retainers. He returns his own phone calls, often flies commercial and still shows up at the kinds of business breakfasts and chicken dinners that most moguls eschew. A few years ago, he used his American Express card to buy a Roy Lichtenstein at Sotheby's for $2.5 million, because he had calculated the interest he could earn by delaying the payment for a month. (He also got 2.5 million frequent-flier miles, most of which he gave away to a local arts college for student travel.)
"Usually, people are visionaries or doers, but not both," said Mr. Riordan, who regularly vacations with Mr. Broad on cruises and bike and ski trips. "He is both a visionary and an incredible doer, who gets onto something like a pit bull and won't let go until he gets it done. To a point that drives you nuts sometimes. On vacation, you want to avoid him. He spent our last vacation, in Sun Valley, on four major topics of what the city needed to do. I just wanted to run the other way."
Asked a couple of years ago what Mr. Broad wanted, one leading Angeleno, a respected graybeard among the city's power players, said, "I think he wants to be the single most influential private citizen in Los Angeles," adding with a chuckle, "And he's got the money to do it."
Mr. Broad has not managed to get everything he wants -- his bid to draw a National Football League team to a revamped Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum failed last year, as did his rivals' -- but it is not for lack of trying.
Associates say that working for him is like working for a jackhammer, that he is fair but relentless, keeping four aides busy in his outer office alone. Golf and other leisure activities hold not the slightest allure; he keeps his perpetual tan by holding long business meetings or reading papers outdoors. His speech, in the flat accent of Michigan, is economical, tending to omit prepositions and definite articles, so that he says, "I was born New York City." Even his passion, collecting modern art, is a business, with a curator and a lending foundation.
His impatience is also legendary. A few years ago, irked that the world-famous architect Frank Gehry was taking too long to finish his new house in the Brentwood section, Mr. Broad hired another architect, with the result that Mr. Gehry disowned the house. (That feud threatened to derail Mr. Broad's later efforts to raise money to finish the Disney Concert Hall in downtown Los Angeles, which Mr. Gehry also designed, but things were smoothed over.) Just now, on the site of two former houses in Malibu, Mr. Broad is building a 4,000-square-foot beach house designed by Richard Meier, who designed the new Getty Center here.
"It's a white Richard Meier house," Mr. Broad said, "and I think white Richard Meier houses look great in beach areas."
Mr. Broad's current projects, both just beginning, are an expansion of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, on whose board he serves, with a new wing and pedestrian arcade (an effort to which he will presumably give millions of dollars) and a public-private undertaking to revive Grand Avenue, the downtown street that is already home to the Los Angeles Music Center and the Museum of Contemporary Art (which Mr. Broad helped found 20 years ago) and that will soon see the completion of the Disney hall and a new cathedral for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles. Just talking about downtown gets him so excited that he pulls out a pad and starts sketching his vision of a new park, pedestrian-friendly sidewalks, restaurants and so on.
"We don't own anything downtown," Mr. Broad said. "All downtown does is cost me a lot of money. But every great metropolitan area needs a core. This city doesn't have any real core. It doesn't have a place where people from different communities can come for free concerts."
Some elected officials have complained that Mr. Broad involves himself in matters, like selecting a new school superintendent, that are none of his business. But he professes pride in such involvement.
"If I think I'm doing what's right," he said, "I think at the end of the day people will appreciate it and I'll feel good about it. And along the way I'm not looking for votes."

HEADLINE: ON HORSE RACING;
In Bid to Buy the Next Derby Winner, the Cost Keeps Getting Higher

BYLINE: By Joe Drape 

DATELINE: SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y.

 BODY:
In gauging the health of any industry, one of the most accurate methods is to follow the money. In horse racing that means following a buff, combed and yet-to-be-raced yearling into the Humphrey S. Finney Sales Pavilion. Then, listen to the auctioneer's sing-song pitch and keep an eye on the tote board. Sometimes the buyers themselves are surprised at the final flash of numbers.
Or at least John C. Oxley was after the gavel banged on his winning bid of $1.25 million for a horse labeled Hip No. 13 at the Fasig-Tipton Saratoga yearling sale on opening night Tuesday. He had just paid a record price for a New York-bred, a Silver Deputy filly out of Screened, the multiple stakes producing Alydar mare. 
 "The price was more than I anticipated, but when you find the right horses, you've got to go ahead and buy them," reasoned Oxley, an oil and gas exploration magnate who owns last year's champion mare, Beautiful Pleasure.
In the past 12 months, buyers have been digging deeper for the right horses and in the process pushing prices to record levels. At last September's Keeneland yearling sale, buyers paid more than $233 million for 3,013 yearlings and boosted the average price for the seventh consecutive year. The $77,357 average price was 30 percent more than the previous record. Last month at Keeneland's summer select yearling sale, the numbers were even more staggering.
Over three sessions, revenues rose for the sixth consecutive year and grossed $82,120,000 to reach their highest level since 1990; the average price of a yearling increased to $621,015 from $581,932. And more records were set here: 137 yearlings were sold for $41,901,000, a 7.6 percent increase in revenue from the record $38,957,000 set last year; and the average price of a yearling was $305,847, up 15.8 percent from the record average set last year.
"You don't know what the high end is anymore," said Eugene Melnyk, who paid $1.8 million for a sale-topping Hennessy filly this week. "After the first two hours of an auction, it's pretty clear you have to pay 50 percent more than you intended."
Strangely, however, this spending spree has boosted the optimism of owners and racing officials in an industry that spent the first half of the 1990's recovering from the bust of its last boom market and the second half of the decade trying to position itself as an entertainment option in a crowded sports market.
"I went broke in the 1980's and I can tell you that was crazy money," said Barry Irwin, who heads Team Valor, which syndicates horses among multiple partners and in the spring took the Santa Anita Derby winner, The Deputy, to the Kentucky Derby. "That money was borrowed, leveraged and invested for tax purposes."
Wiser money or not, the strategy remains the same for horse traders. Buy low, sell high and become the next Fusao Sekiguchi.
Sekiguchi is the Japanese entrepreneur who recently sold controlling interest in the Kentucky Derby winner Fusaichi Pegasus to Coolmore Stud. In 1998 he bought the colt for $4 million, won $1.89 million with him this year, and sold him at a reported value of $60 million to $70 million -- though it was unclear what his take was because 40 percent of the horse belongs to the Yoshida family of Japan.
"It's the big home run everyone is after," Melnyk said. "It pays for the rest of the fun."
Like most owners, Melnyk, 41, wants to swing for those fences. But he also is one of the newer breed of owners -- among them are Mike Pegram, who won the 1998 Kentucky Derby with Real Quiet, and Jim Scatuorchio, who races More Than Ready -- who came to horse ownership from the front side, or betting windows.
Melnyk's interest as a horse player at age 14 evolved to his becoming an every weekend track attendee, to owning claiming horses in the 1980's and, last week, winning the Jim Dandy here with Graeme Hall just five years after plunging into the top-end horse market. He owns 138 horses, including stallions, brood mares and 36 2-year-olds that he hopes will make it to the Triple Crown races next year.
With Churchill Downs Inc. and MI Entertainment Corp., founded by the industrialist Frank Stronach, rapidly acquiring racetracks, Melnyk believes he is betting wisely as an owner as well as an industry handicapper.
Churchill Downs and MI Entertainment each own six tracks, from Florida to California. "We are in the early stages of consolidation, which means high-end tracks will offer more high-end races and purses," Melnyk said.
In an industry known for its divisions between owners, racetrack operators and horseman, the National Thoroughbred Racing Association, now in its third year of existence as a quasi-league office, may finally be providing some focus. The organization has increased the hours of race coverage on network and cable television, delivered clever television commercials and fostered a spirit of cooperation.
Last Sunday, for example, a Mystery Mutuel Voucher promotion boosted attendance at tracks across the country on a day of national stakes races headlined here by the Whitney. The N.T.R.A. mailed vouchers, redeemable at 32 tracks and off-track betting outlets, to more than one million people. One Voucher was worth $1 million, and tracks combined to offer $2.7 million in prizes. No one cashed the $1 million voucher, but an increase in attendance and handle was significant -- ranging from a 22 percent increase in attendance at Monmouth Park on Sunday, the day of the Haskell, to a 524 percent increase in attendance at Mountaineer Park in West Virginia.
The economy is good right now, so the pursuit of fast horses can be costly. But owners like Melnyk and Irwin believe this competitive market is in good hands.
"Now we have people in the game for the right reasons," Irwin said. "To have fun and make money."

HEADLINE: Recycling, Our Gift to Tomorrow

 BODY:

To the Editor:
John Tierney's discussion of the local economics of recycling is rather shortsighted (Big City column, Aug. 8). 
 Recycling paper, plastic, glass and metal saves trees, oil and energy derived from combustion of fossil fuels. Combustion causes global warming and acid rain. The benefits of recycling are not only obvious; they are also priceless.

HEADLINE: As Opportunity Knocks, Police Turn In Badges

BYLINE: By KEVIN FLYNN 

 BODY:
The departures are the talk of station house hallways. In a matter of days, the New York Police Department will be losing its commissioner, Howard Safir, and his second in command, Patrick Kelleher. Within weeks, the deputy commissioner who directs narcotics enforcement will be leaving, as will the chief who supervises police hiring.
But those departures, however high profile, are only part of a larger surge in retirements by police officers this year. 
 In the first seven months of 2000, 703 police officers of various ranks have filed for retirement, a 38 percent increase over the same period last year. Police Department officials say this represents but a trickle in a department with 40,000 officers, but leaders of the their unions say it is the beginning of a major exodus, as officers hand in their badges to pursue better-paying, less dangerous jobs where no one calls them names.
"We predicted this would occur back six or seven years ago," said Capt. John Driscoll, president of the Captains Endowment Association, a union representing many supervisory officers. Police officials "chose to ignore it because everybody felt that, by the time it became a big problem, they would be retired," he said.
The reasons for this retirement surge are many. But two leading factors are the lure of private-sector jobs in a booming economy and the discontent many officers feel after several years of heightened criticism and pay that lags behind that of some of their suburban counterparts. And police officials attribute a large part of the increase to the number of officers who became eligible for retirement in the last two years.
If the trend continues, the Police Department will have to recruit enough officers to replace the retirees if it is going to maintain the current size of the patrol force. That could be daunting, given the results of recent recruitment drives.
In New York, as in cities around the country, interest in police careers has fallen. Even with an unprecedented $10 million recruiting campaign by the New York Police Department last year, only 15,000 people signed up to take the qualifying test. Although many of the candidates were city residents, which the department had identified as a prime goal, that number was only half the number of candidates who had signed up for the same exam three years earlier.
This summer, recruiters have had a hard time finding people to fill the next Police Academy class, which has 1,589 slots and is scheduled to begin training late next month. "At this point we are working very hard to get to that number," said Inspector George Anderson of the personnel bureau.
Compounding the problem is the fact that the number of officers eligible for retirement -- those who have completed 20 years of service -- is about to jump sharply. In the mid-1990's, very few officers became eligible for retirement because virtually none were hired two decades before, during the city's fiscal crisis. Even this year, only 419 officers who were hired in 1980 are scheduled to complete their 20th year.
But beginning next year, thousands of officers who were hired in the early 1980's as the city began to rebuild its force will be eligible to retire with a pension equal to half their salary. Patrick Lynch, president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, the union that represents police officers, said he thought that most of the newly eligible officers would choose to retire. "Police officers are not staying on this job," he said. "That's a firm bet."
Police officials have characterized that sort of statement as union bluster intended to gain leverage at the bargaining table, where the union is seeking a new contract with a sizable wage increase. A rookie officer is now paid $31,428 a year, and typically earns about $3,000 more in overtime, holiday pay and a differential applied for working the night shift.
Department officials said they did not believe that widespread departures were imminent. Rather, they said, they have made the sorts of adjustments, like an expansion in the number of captain positions so as to create promotion opportunities, that would help prevent an exodus.
Police officials say the recent rise in retirements seems startling only because it follows several years in which retirements fell. In 1998, for example, 617 officers, of all ranks, retired from the department. Last year, the number of retirements rose to 888. Officials project that the number will exceed 1,200 this year.
But the increase in retirements cannot be completely explained by the rise in the number of officers who have become eligible. Indeed, over the last two years, the rate of retirement has outpaced the rate at which officers have become eligible.
Retirement has become a particularly attractive option in New York because the pension system, as now formulated, rewards people who retire. Most officers who retire can bring home almost as much money as they did walking a beat.
With tax breaks and a special benefit known as the variable supplement fund, which provides retired officers with $8,500 a year on top of their pension, officers often find that their yearly take-home pay is only several thousand dollars less than what they were earning on the job. And those interested in starting a second career could make a windfall compared with what they would have made had they stayed on the job.
"It is not good to lose a large number of veteran officers," said Thomas A. Reppetto, author of "NYPD: A City and Its Police" (Henry Holt & Company, 2000), "and some police departments have tried to counter this by making it very attractive for veteran officers to stay, by raising their pay or giving them enhanced status."
Some departments are also trying to bolster their manpower by heavily recruiting for officers in New York City. Police forces from sunny climes like Los Angeles and Las Vegas now make efforts to lure New York officers a prime part of their recruiting strategy, which has only added to the obstacles facing police officials in New York. "We are going to look at as many strategies as we can to make sure we get the candidates that we need to take our test," said Inspector Anderson of the personnel bureau.
One of the city's new strategies was unveiled Thursday: a $10 million advertising campaign with a compelling story line that features people like the actor Ray Romano, of the television comedy "Everybody Loves Raymond." In one ad, he speaks with admiration about his brother, a New York police sergeant. "I may get the attention," Mr. Romano says of his brother, "but he's the one who deserves it."
Mr. Romano's brother, Sgt. Richard Romano, ended up receiving quite a bit of attention, however, at the news conference announcing the campaign. In remarks to reporters at the event, Sergeant Romano said that as much as he loved his job and the department, he was retiring next month. "I've done 20 years on the streets," he said, "and every man has his point where he says it's his breaking point."

HEADLINE: BASBEALL;
Power Trip As Piazza Charges Up The Mets

BYLINE: By JACK CURRY 

 BODY:
Mark Gardner threw a fastball that tailed inside on Mike Piazza, and immediately Gardner knew. Everyone knew. Gardner slammed his hand against his right leg, glanced toward left field and then looked away. But Piazza's towering shot in the fourth inning stayed in the air so long that Gardner peeked one more time, watched the two-run homer land in the picnic area and shook his head.
By that time, Piazza was nearing second base and Snap's "I Got the Power" was blaring on a soggy night at Shea Stadium. The Mets definitely had the power last night as Edgardo Alfonzo pounded a two-run homer two innings later to almost the identical spot as Piazza's blow and helped the Mets rumble to a 4-1 victory over the San Francisco Giants. 
 So the Mets kept on churning. They have won 14 of their last 17 games, they still trail the first-place Atlanta Braves by two and a half games but they have padded their lead in the wild-card skirmish. On a night when Glendon Rusch was more gritty than good, the Mets were satisfied with his five tedious innings as he allowed only one run.
Three relievers nabbed the last 12 outs and helped the Mets begin avenging a four-game sweep by San Francisco in early May. The Mets are a different team now, an improved team, and they have not lost more than three games in a row since that series.
Their starters have been superb, their bullpen has been awesome and Piazza is playing like a most valuable player, which the fans chanted over and over.
"Mike's been most valuable, most spectacular and most dependable," Manager Bobby Valentine said. "He's been the most of a lot of things this year."
Valentine said that Piazza seems "more driven" this season, more driven to carry the Mets to a World Series title because it is "that time in his career." Piazza lowered his head when he was asked about the fans chanting "M.V.P., M.V.P." for his 31 homers, 97 runs batted in and .349 average.
"It's kind of early," said Piazza, who has twice finished second in voting for the award. "Obviously, it's flattering. You've got to try and contribute and do your job when you get up there."
Dusty Baker and Valentine shook hands behind the batting cage before the game, which was just as curious as Valentine and the Mets' president, Fred Wilpon, doing it. Baker and Valentine are managers who do not like each other, and Wilpon has adamantly refused to give Valentine or General Manager Steve Phillips contract extensions.
But Baker had to watch Piazza and Alfonzo go deep, which made Valentine smile, and Wilpon must wonder about his decisions and what kind of an impact they might have on the Mets in 2001.
For now, the Mets are focused on today. Gardner faced only nine batters through the first three innings and was incredibly economical, throwing only three pitches for balls. But Darryl Hamilton, who was starting a game in left field for the first time since Sept. 20, 1993, had a leadoff double in the fourth.
After Gardner retired the next two Mets, Piazza strolled to the plate and there was a buzz. Piazza had two homers in 15 career at-bats against Gardner, and, when Gardner threw a 1-0 fastball that rode in on the hands, Piazza quickly turned on it and hammered it. Piazza is 8 for 20 with two homers and 12 runs batted in over the last five games since returning from a strained knee.
"As far as my vote goes, he'd be my M.V.P.," Rusch said about an award that is voted on by sportswriters. "He's doing it all. He's a huge presence in the lineup."
Alfonzo, who heard the same chants last season that Piazza is hearing in 2000, said, "He's the guy right now."
Before Piazza's 411-foot homer, the Giants had loaded the bases against Rusch in the second and third innings without scoring. Rusch took advantage of Umpire Charlie Williams's wide strike zone to strike out Barry Bonds and Rich Aurilia with 1-2 fastballs on the inside corner in the third. Both players complained, but Rusch survived.
The Giants nicked Rusch for a run in the fifth, but Rusch retired Aurilia with his 103rd pitch of the game and his night was over. Then Alfonzo hit a two-run homer, Gardner hopped off the mound in distress a second time and the Mets were happy to be home. They were also thrilled that the valuable Piazza is wearing their uniform.
"I'm not trying to set any benchmarks or records," Piazza said. "I've always let the attention take care of itself. I'm honored. I'm not doing more than trying to be consistent. It's kind of boring, but it works for me."
 
INSIDE PITCH
BOBBY VALENTINE continued to play musical outfielders as he tries to fit four outfielders into three positions. DARRYL HAMILTON made his first start in left in almost seven years, JAY PAYTON was in center, DEREK BELL handled right and BENNY AGBAYANI was benched. In the three games since Hamilton was activated, the only constant has been Payton in center. Valentine said the outfield was only a story because of the news media scrutiny in New York. "Being in our city, the guys have to understand that it's not a big deal if they miss a game," Valentine said. Hamilton has advised his teammates to focus on the "big picture" and not who starts. "If I can deal with this, I think a couple of young guys can deal with it, too," said Hamilton.

HEADLINE: The Senate's Philosopher-King

 BODY:

THE GENTLEMAN
 FROM NEW YORK
 Daniel Patrick Moynihan: A Biography.
 By Godfrey Hodgson.
 Illustrated. 452 pp. Boston:
 Houghton Mifflin Company. $38. 
 Only one sitting member of the United States Senate had an honored seat at the funerals of both Richard M. Nixon and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. Only one has written or edited 18 books (at last count). Only one has tended bar in Hell's Kitchen and taught at Harvard, corrected John F. Kennedy's arithmetic and William Jefferson Clinton's decorum. And only one, it seems more than safe to say, owns a splendid oil painting of a brooding boy by the Irish artist Jack B. Yeats, the poet's brother.
More to the point, perhaps only one or two other senators among the 100 now serving would merit a full-scale intellectual and political biography, which is the task that the British journalist Godfrey Hodgson has set himself in this lucid, engaging study of the life and career of Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the Senate's philosopher-king. Moynihan is to retire at the end of this session, after more than four decades in the thick of American politics, and "The Gentleman From New York" lands in a depressing election year as a bracing reminder of the enduring potential for honor and intellect in a calling no longer thought of as full of either -- and of the possibility of poetry, too.
Coming to terms with Moynihan is not easy, for he has spent a political lifetime confounding would-be allies and enemies alike. Baptized a Catholic and born a Democrat, as he likes to say, he began his career as a stalwart postwar New Dealer, in the mold of F.D.R. and Averell Harriman, an early boss, then became a fiercely proud New Frontiersman. Bruised by the tumult of the 1960's and the furor surrounding his much-misunderstood report on the collapse of the black family, Moynihan became for a time the right's favorite liberal, or the left's favorite neocon, or both, before emerging again in the Reagan and Clinton years as a staunch defender of the liberal tradition.
Hodgson's affectionate goal is to chronicle this ideological odyssey, which he deftly summarizes in his introduction as "a parade." But from the beginning, he makes it clear that it is folly to seek any label that fits Moynihan, except perhaps skeptic (and at that a skeptic of an unusually hardheaded, bighearted variety). "His greatest gift is to handicap the intellectual horses," Hodgson, the author of "America in Our Time," writes in a typically felicitous passage. "He picks up tips about their form, decides which ones will run and run and sticks his intellectual and political wad on the ones he thinks will be winners. There have been some slow coaches and some fallers. But the record of his form book is truly imposing." Indeed, from his early promotion of auto safety to his warnings about the social dislocation of a generation of poor children, from his prescient conviction that the Soviet Union would collapse of its own weight to his understanding of the havoc that the Reagan-era budget deficits would play with domestic spending, from his determination to restore the grandeur of Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington to his support for a similar effort at Pennsylvania Station in New York City, Moynihan has been ahead of his time. To put it another way, he has been right.
Neither Moynihan nor his formidable wife and chief political counselor, Elizabeth, is known to suffer fools gladly. And in a book dedicated to the couple and written with their cooperation, Hodgson gives due regard to the senator's streaks of arrogance and temper, to his difficulties in retaining staff members, to the number of onetime friends who became enemies, to his philosophical about-faces. But perhaps more striking, given Moynihan's long run on the national stage, are the durability and diversity of his friendships across ideological lines and the modesty with which, in the twilight of his career, he regards his and his government's ability to be right, or at least to do big things right. Moynihan's skepticism, Hodgson writes, "is not because of any ideological objection to government." It is, rather, "part of a pessimism, almost a melancholy, about the workings of the universe and its human inhabitants which is culturally, if not theologically, religious in nature, and is quite compatible with cheerfulness, even ebullience, about the actual workings of government."
Suffice it to say that such a melancholy pessimism is not standard equipment for American politicians circa 2000, and Moynihan's fellow legislators, especially his fellow Democrats, have always been among his toughest critics. Few big bills, few big battles for a cause, much big talk, goes the refrain (which often includes an unfavorable contrast with his Massachusetts colleague Edward M. Kennedy). Hodgson cops a kind of plea to the first two charges and proceeds to argue that Moynihan's stock in trade is something rarer, big ideas.
These ideas have been the principal source of his professional reputation and the principal cause of his greatest professional pain, never more so than with the report he wrote in 1965 as a Labor Department official in the Johnson administration, "The Negro Family: The Case for National Action." In this document, forever after known as the Moynihan Report, Moynihan, himself the child of a home that was thrown from middle-class stability into penury and turmoil when his will-o'-the-wisp father abandoned it, argued that a mass abdication of the duties of fatherhood by black men was imperiling their wives and children, condemning them to poverty and despair and their society to what he later called "a new and wholly unexpected range of social conflict."
In some of the biography's most compelling passages, Hodgson contends that what Moynihan was advocating was nothing more or less than what came to be known as affirmative action. But, thanks in part to incomplete press accounts and the tumult of the times, Moynihan was accused of blaming the victim, and suffered the unsparing criticism of an interracial, interfaith array of civil rights advocates, psychologists and sociologists. This rebuke set Moynihan off on a wandering trajectory that led to academia (Wesleyan, Harvard) and ultimately to his service as a domestic policy adviser in the Nixon White House, where he managed to get in trouble all over again by suggesting that race relations could benefit from a period of "benign neglect." (He meant a break from overheated oratory, but that's not how he was heard.)
It seems probable that Moynihan never quite recovered from the bitterness of those days. It seems equally likely that his involuntary unmooring from partisan orthodoxy made possible the best and most penetrating moments of his political career, which has stretched to four Senate terms of scrutinizing the Central Intelligence Agency, advocating mass transit, defending poor children and bringing New York State untold old-fashioned pork.
Hodgson is at his best in describing Moynihan's evolving interior intellectual monologues. In this he is aided by access to voluminous published and private writings, including a youthful diary that details Moynihan's romances and brief psychoanalysis when he was a Fulbright scholar at the London School of Economics (as well as 35 years of friendship, begun when he and the Moynihans were neighbors in Washington). His account of the senator's early years owes an acknowledged debt to "Pat," Douglas Schoen's 1979 biography. The passions and political maneuverings of Moynihan's years as Nixon's ambassador to India and Gerald R. Ford's to the United Nations are vigorously dispatched.
Just over 125 pages are devoted to Moynihan's Senate career, covered chronologically, a logical organizing scheme but one that sometimes keeps a reader to-ing and fro-ing between chapters on similar topical material, as do earlier chapters about the Moynihan Report (its writing is handled in one, the storm over its reception in another). Here again, Hodgson is most interesting in describing Moynihan's intellectual modus operandi (the carefully chosen issue, the well-placed op-ed piece) rather than his legislative one.
Hodgson deals briefly but directly with Moynihan's reputation as a tippler, subscribing to the conventional view that his capacity has always been large, that his appetite seldom if ever affected his performance and that his consumption, with age, has dwindled chiefly to Tio Pepe, a dry sherry that his staff calls "the Mexican ambassador," as in "The senator's with the Mexican ambassador." In the end Hodgson portrays a grand old man, at peace with his impending retirement (if much more skeptical about his potential successor, Hillary Rodham Clinton, than he is inclined to acknowledge) and likely to be remembered "as the man who -- in the face of a generation that thought it had abolished the need for government -- had the lucidity and the courage to restate the enduring propositions of the American political creed."

HEADLINE: One Cruise With a Taste Of 3 Nations

BYLINE: By DONNA MARCHETTI; DONNA MARCHETTI is the author of "Lake Michigan: A Guide to Small Towns, Rural Areas and Natural Attractions" (Glovebox Guidebooks of America).

 BODY:
I AM a sucker for the Great Lakes. I vacation on them. I swim in them. I walk their beaches and scuba dive in them. I even live on one -- Lake Erie. But one of the few things I'd never done on the Great Lakes was take a cruise.
Great Lakes passenger ships have a long and venerable history. In the days before cars and planes, when ships offered the most exciting way to get somewhere, vacationers from Cleveland, Buffalo, Chicago and Milwaukee regularly boarded vessels that took them to resort towns. Many of these ships boasted a level of luxury that rivaled oceangoing liners. Very few of these historic vessels remain; the once-beautiful Keewatin, now a museum on Lake Michigan, is in a sad state of disrepair. 
 It took Europeans to revive interest in passenger ships on the Great Lakes: In 1997 the Columbus was built in Germany specifically to navigate the Great Lakes. The 472-foot cruise ship sails all over the world, spending winters in tropical locales like the Caribbean or the South Pacific. But in the summer it comes back to the lakes.
Owned by a German company, Hapag-Lloyd, the Columbus is chartered each year by one or more American companies for Great Lakes cruises.
The Columbus began selling its cruises mostly to Germans; in 1998 one trip was opened to North Americans. Last year there were three, and when I heard about them, I vowed to be on board for one.
Time and money constraints led me to choose the shortest of the three (each of the other cruises was 10 days). My three-night, four-day jaunt, operated under charter by by the Great Lakes Cruise Company, would embark from Windsor, Ontario, travel up the Detroit River, then into Lake St. Clair, up the St. Clair River to the top of Lake Huron and back, debarking at Detroit. (Because of United States and Canadian maritime laws regarding foreign-owned ships, we had to embark from one country and debark in the other.) The ship was scheduled to stop at Manitoulin Island in Ontario and Mackinac Island, Mich. The cruise was set for the first week of October, just in time, the brochure said, to catch the fall colors at their height.
Originally I thought I would be alone. I booked a double outside cabin with a "partially obstructed view." It was smaller than the other outside cabins and almost $200 less expensive because of the obstruction and reduced size. Several months later, when my sister, Carol, told me she would be able to join me, I had completely forgotten about the small cabin with the partial view.
We boarded the ship on a Saturday in Windsor at pretty Dieppe Park (taking a $30 cab ride from just across the river in Detroit, where we had left our car after driving from Cleveland). We were immediately ushered into the dining room for lunch while our cabins were being prepared. It was the first of many delightful meals: perfectly poached salmon drizzled with cucumber dill sauce, tiny roasted potatoes. German wine and beer flowed freely.
Capable of carrying 418 passengers and a crew of 170, the Columbus is beautifully appointed and well maintained. Numerous times over the short cruise we saw crew members on hands and knees, scrubbing tiny spots off the carpet or sprucing up chrome.
Though small by cruise ship standards, the Columbus has many of the features you would expect on an oceangoing ship: lovely public sitting areas with beautiful views, a cozy wine bar, a small exercise room facing the water, a library, lounge, large dining room, sauna, hair salon, boutique, lots of deck space, a swimming pool, and a good-size hall for shows and the lectures on Great Lakes history that took place throughout the cruise.
By the time the ship left the dock, a light drizzle was falling and the Detroit skyline passed in a soggy blur. Spirits were high, though, as we continued on our way, waving to people on pleasure boats and to crews on freighters that passed close by. Though the cruise was completely booked, and most passengers were on deck for the departure, we didn't feel crowded then or any time later on the trip.
Rain finally drove us to our cabin, where we discovered that our "partially obstructed view" consisted entirely of a 150-person lifeboat-tender perched just outside our cabin. It was possible, we learned through experimentation, to sit on about a square-foot area of one of the berths and catch a glimpse of a six-inch sliver of water.
Otherwise, we were quite satisfied with our cabin, small but still roomy enough to be comfortable. The space had been well planned -- there was plenty of storage, a substantial bathroom with vanity and shower, two comfy berths and a table and chair. Other amenities included a minibar, safe, telephone, TV, good reading lights and cabin temperature control. Chocolate-covered strawberries provided a nice touch, as did a fresh flower. My favorite part, though, was the fluffy European-style down-filled comforter and pillow.
We found, in fact, many European touches to the ship -- most of them pleasant, a couple inconvenient. The food had a subtle European elegance, and was always well executed. The restaurant opened exactly as scheduled and other events like lectures and the nightly musical entertainment also began promptly. On the down side: although the mostly European crew spoke English, some were more fluent than others, and small misunderstandings often occurred. All prices on board -- in the gift shop and on the restaurant's beverage list -- were in marks, the cause of endless head scratching among our four table mates.
We missed the predinner cocktail hour that first night, enjoying ourselves instead with champagne in our cabin (we brought our own; there was only the minibar, no cabin service), speculating on the view beyond our lifeboat. Dinner for me was salad with delicate truffle-cream dressing, a delicious couscous-stuffed eggplant and for dessert, a small plate of European cheeses. Not being a meat eater, I was grateful for the daily vegetarian selection at both lunch and dinner.
Later that evening we ventured onto the deck, but a cold wind was blowing with a ferocity that held portents for the coming night. I awoke at 1:30 a.m. to feel the boat pitching and creaking with far more vehemence than I thought possible for a large boat on a lake, at one point slamming down on the water with a thud that set the whole place shuddering.
By morning the storm had passed, the water was calm and we could see sunlight peeking in from around our window shade. Eager to see the sun, I opened the shade, still in my nightshirt, and found myself face-to-face with an equally startled crew member working on the tender.
At noon we anchored off Manitoulin Island near the picturesque town of Little Current, population 1,600. From the water the island appeared almost uninhabited, covered with forests of pine and hardwood just beginning to turn colors. At more than 80 miles long and from 2 to 40 miles wide, Manitoulin Island is often billed as the world's largest freshwater island, though there is apparently a larger island in the Amazon River delta (which may at times, presumably, be brackish, but we're splitting hairs). There are more than 100 inland lakes on Manitoulin, some of them with their own islands.
The island's name comes from "Manitou" or "Great Spirit" in the language of the Algonquin group of American Indian tribes that lived throughout the Upper Great Lakes when the Europeans began to arrive in the 1600's and 1700's. Many descendants of the first Indian inhabitants live today on Manitoulin -- about a quarter of the island's 12,000 residents. The economy is based primarily on farming, lumbering, fishing, livestock raising and -- increasingly -- tourism.
We had signed up for an excursion advertised as an Ojibwe dance and drum group performance, though it proved to be more. After boarding buses in Little Current, we were driven about eight miles to West Bay, also known by its Indian name, M'Chigeeng. There we received a brief introduction to Ojibwe culture by Chief Glen Hare, followed by a tour of the Ojibwe Cultural Foundation, which houses many works by local artists as well as artifacts and museum pieces.
But the high point of the day was a powwow in an outdoor arena nearby. The crisp fall air smelled of pine and wood smoke, and colorful leaves glowed against a sky just beginning to cloud. We watched as dancers, mostly teenage boys and girls, performed their traditional dances accompanied by musicians and singers. Especially fascinating was a hoop dancer, who maneuvered about two dozen hoops to create shapes of things in nature -- a bird, a butterfly emerging from its cocoon, a flower. At the end of the performance, the audience was invited to participate, adding a celebratory note to the day.
The ship left Manitoulin just as the sun was setting and sailed through the night to Mackinac Island, which took 13 hours at a deliberately leisurely pace. Once again the day dawned bright and sunny, though a chilly 40 degrees.
We were on the first tender at 8 a.m., when the slanting sun shone golden on that beautiful island.
What many people associate with the island, the name of which is pronounced MAC-uh-naw, are the things that are immediately noticeable to tourists. The lack of motorized vehicles, by order of a turn-of-the-century edict, means that all nonemergency transportation -- even for deliveries -- is accomplished by horse or bicycle. The island is known for its fudge stands and souvenir shops, and perhaps most famous for the elegant Grand Hotel, the setting for the 1980 movie "Somewhere in Time."
But the island is steeped in history that goes further back than tourism. Its strategic location in the Straits of Mackinac, where Lakes Huron and Michigan join, and only a short distance from Lake Superior, put it at the crossroads for voyageurs, traders and the British and American military. Fort Mackinac, in a stunning location overlooking the water, was built by the British in 1780-81 but was later ceded to the United States.
Because I had visited the island twice during the summer before the cruise and had done the usual tourist activities, we decided to try something a bit different and explore the island on horseback. We stopped by Cindy's Riding Stable, hired horses and a guide and went off for a ride in the cold, clear morning. We sauntered over wooded trails up to the highest point of the island, the ruins of Fort Holmes, from whose vantage point the British had retaken Fort Mackinac during the War of 1812. From there we had a spectacular view of the harbor below and our ship anchored to the east. To the west was the Mackinac Bridge, one of the world's longest suspension bridges, which connects Michigan's lower and upper peninsulas.
Back on the ship, it was lunchtime, with some people in the dining room, and the rest enjoying a lively Oktoberfest on the deck by the pool. Sausages, sauerkraut, pretzels and beer were being savored in the chilly air, while a few hardy passengers played in the heated pool, beers in hand. The ship pulled up anchor just after lunch and sailed under the bridge, the top of the stacks appearing to brush its bottom. We turned around and passed under it again, then headed south to Detroit, where we would get off the next morning.
The all-too-brief cruise was what I had hoped for -- relaxing and elegant yet casual, against a backdrop of subtly gorgeous scenery that has long held special appeal for me. The only thing I would do differently were I to sail again on the Columbus: spend the money for a full view, leaving the close encounter with a lifeboat for an emergency.
 
Voyageurs with all the comforts
 
Booking a Cruise
I arranged the cruise aboard the Columbus from Windsor, Ontario, to Detroit through the Great Lakes Cruise Company, 3270 Washtenaw Avenue, Ann Arbor, Mich. 48104; (734) 477-6045, fax (734) 677-3128; www.greatlakescruiseco.com.
My sister and I drove from Cleveland to Detroit, where we left our car in a downtown parking garage. We took a taxi to Dieppe Park in Windsor, Ontario. United States and Canadian maritime laws require the Columbus to depart from a different city from the one it returns to. This was not an inconvenience because Windsor and Detroit are a 15-minute taxi ride apart. Some itineraries require more complicated arrangements, which must be made by the passenger.
Our double cabin was $682 a person, including meals, lectures and entertainment aboard ship, tips and port taxes. We also paid $34 each for the ship's tour to an Ojibwe powwow on Manitoulin Island.
During our stop on Mackinac Island, we went horseback riding on our own at Cindy's Riding Stable, on Market Street, (906) 847-3572, at a cost of $25 a person for the first hour, $20 for each additional hour, including a guide.
 
Future Cruises
This year, the Great Lakes Cruise Company will offer cruises on the Columbus and Le Levant, a 330-foot luxury yacht built in France in 1998.
The Columbus, owned by Hapag-Lloyd, will sail Sept. 13 for a 10-day Great Lakes Odyssey that will begin in Windsor, Ontario, and end in Chicago, with stops at Tobermory, Sault Ste. Marie and Thunder Bay in Ontario; Duluth, Minn.; Marquette, Mackinac Island and Traverse City, Mich.; and Manitowoc, Wis.
Double cabins range from $1,722 to $3,299 per person. Suites range from $3,382 to $3,747 per person, double occupancy. Single cabins are $3,013 to $5,773. Although all meals are included, gratuities no longer are; beverages and shore trips also are extra.
Le Levant, owned by Compagnie des Iles du Ponant in Nantes, France, will next sail on Sept. 23. The weeklong cruise will begin in Toronto and end at Chicago, with stops at Niagara Falls, Windsor, Manitoulin Island and Sault Ste. Marie in Ontario, and Mackinac Island and Saugatuck, Mich. Per person rates for double occupancy cabins range from $3,725 to $5,425. All staterooms are outside cabins. Single cabins are $6,519 to $9,494. Rates include many items the Columbus's fares do not, like one night in a luxury Toronto hotel before sailing, all shore excursions, wine at lunch and dinner, some meals at ports of call and tips.
In 2001, Great Lakes Cruise Company will offer two weeklong sailings on Le Levant and four weeklong cruises on the Columbus. Fares will range from $1,098 to $4,696 a person, double, on the Columbus and $4,043 to $5,801 on Le Levant, with discounts for booking before Dec. 15.
Another addition to Great Lakes cruising will begin with the 2001 season. The 367-foot Arcadia, owned by Golden Sun, a Greek company, will offer 24 sailings with 11 itineraries, ranging from three nights to seven. Most begin in Windsor and end in Detroit. The ship, which has a Greek and North American crew, was built in 1969 and refurbished in 1989. It has undergone several upgrades since then. Prices per person, double occupancy, range from $430 to $1,795. Contact Great Lakes Cruises, 217 Wisconsin Avenue, Waukesha, Wis. 53186; (877) 777-4524; Web site: www.greatlakescruises.com.

HEADLINE: The Nasdaq-ing Of Capitol Hill

BYLINE: By Sara Miles; Sara Miles is the author of "How to Hack a Party Line: The Democrats and Silicon Valley," to be published in January.

 BODY:
Most of the Democrats gathering this week in Los Angeles for their national convention don't know yet who John Witchel is. But he and his friends are planning to crash the Democrats' party with a straightforward message: they want in. "We already drive every significant sector of the economy," Witchel says. "The keys to the kingdom are squarely in our hands. I'm here to say there's a next generation of Internet executives, and we're ready to become national political players."
John Witchel is a big, driven man, a former Stanford jock with a booming voice. At 32, he is running his third successful company, the San Francisco-based Red Gorilla, while serving on the boards of seven other Internet start-ups. But Witchel's current obsession is not business but politics -- an arena he feels is ripe for the attention of entrepre-neurs. "Priced today," he says, sounding slightly surprised by his dis-covery, "politics is the bargain of the century. For $10 million you could do anything." 
 Not that Witchel is interested in buying politicians. What he wants, simply, is to be a political somebody, "one of a small handful of trusted people," as he puts it, "who can be helpful when needed." So Witchel has just helped start a new enterprise, PAC.com, a political action committee aimed at centrist Democrats. Along with Witchel, the main organizers include his Red Gorilla colleague Wade Randlett, Tim Newell of E*Offering, Joe Kraus of Excite@home, Chris Larsen of E-Loan and E. David Ellington of NetNoir. While these power brokers lack the star power of Hollywood, they have an even more glamorous currency that they plan to start handing out: equity.
For starters, PAC.com's 20 members will each contribute $1,000 a month in plain old cash to politicians who meet with them for dinner and conversation. (This year, they're focusing on Congress, where a small group has more "leverage," and not on the presidential race.) That's the traditional part; what's new is that members will also give stock in their pre-I.P.O. or newly public companies to PAC.com to put into a kitty and disburse over time. "We can cash it out and give it to a politician," explains Randlett, "and say here's five grand. Or we can say here's $5,000 worth of shares; you hang on to it and see where it goes."
This kind of equity could have vast implications for the world of politics. If Joe Kraus of Excite, for example, had contributed just $1,000 worth of stock to a senator right when the company went public in April 1996, three years later, even after some scary losses and plunges, that senator would have had $15,992 to spend on campaigning.
It's a pretty tempting proposition, though even tech-friendly politicians express reservations. Representative Adam Smith, a Democrat from Washington and the campaign chairman for the New Democrat Network, which has worked hard to forge links to high tech, believes that few candidates will be willing to play the market with their campaign budgets. After all, the stock could just as easily be eToys as Excite.
Smith does believe, however, that the identification with PAC.com and its pool of stock might "help brand candidates a little bit further" by linking them to the New Economy. Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont doesn't accept money from PAC's himself, but he, too, sees the appeal of the idea. "I think it's an intriguing way for young dot-com people to participate," says Leahy, who has long championed Internet issues. "It makes sense to them. As far as ethics, the bottom line is, whenever you take any donation, it's reported, it's public knowledge. Whether you take cash from or stock in Polluters-R"-Us.com, if you're voting against an environmental issue, the public will know."
If politicians are cautious, campaign-finance reformers have already made up their minds. "A sweetheart deal in pre-I.P.O. stock has a back-room stench to it, even if it's legal," charges E. Joshua Rosenkranz, president of the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law, which has been studying campaign finance. "If you believe contribution limits mean anything, then making a contribution that explodes in value within a few days is a blatant subversion of them."
Ronald Turovsky, a partner at Manatt, Phelps & Phillips in Los Angeles and the election-law specialist who is advising PAC.com, sounds unconcerned, however, and asserts that he has "no doubt" that it's appropriate for politicians to receive stocks. "There's nothing in the F.E.C. regulations or statutes that would prohibit it," he says. In fact, in correspondence with PAC.com, officials at the Federal Elections Commission affirmed the plan to give out stock.
While PAC.com is a small, start-up operation, it is undoubtedly what its founders like to call, in Internet jargon, "scalable": other PAC's and individuals from around the country can borrow the idea and take it where they want to. For better or worse, the world of campaign finance is likely to change. Like so much else in American culture, politics will be pulled even further into the orbit of the stock market and the Internet economy. And along with it, the influence of men like John Witchel stands to grow.
When Microsoft first got into trouble with the justice department, the established tech companies, who used to keep their distance from national politics, swiftly beefed up their lobbying operations and began playing the Washington game. PAC.com, however, represents a different trend; its members have little patience for doing government affairs by the book and tend to see the big computer companies as hopelessly old-fashioned. "The C.E.O.'s who ruled Silicon Valley five years ago are middle-aged and corporate," Witchel says disdainfully. "Our guys are in their 20's and 30's. They have 25 employees. They don't have lobbyists. They don't go to Business Roundtable meetings."
Witchel and his allies don't even look like traditional Silicon Valley types; they're more frat boy than geek. At 40, Tim Newell calls himself "the old man" of the group; a husky Vermonter, he towers over most Internet executives like a football player among chess-club nerds. Newell, a former White House aide turned investment banker, runs E*Offering, which enables individuals to invest in I.P.O.'s online. Joe Kraus, a founder of Excite, is a goateed 29-year-old; his company, begun in a burrito shop during his senior year at Stanford, had a market value early this month of $5 billion. David Ellington, the cigar-smoking, 40-year-old C.E.O. of NetNoir, runs the Web's leading black-oriented site. Chris Larsen, 39, a windsurfing enthusiast, is the founder and C.E.O. of E-Loan, an online lending service whose original interface he programmed himself. Wade Randlett, 35, who favors tailor-made suits, was a Democratic political consultant who helped found Silicon Valley's first PAC, the Technology Network, in 1997 -- hands-down the single person who defined high-tech fund-raising," says Newell.
"We're like NASA was in the 60's," claims David Ellington. "Then, everyone wanted to hang out with the astronauts. Now everyone wants to be down with the future."
These self-styled "Astronauts" are largely Democrats. They made their fortunes on Bill Clinton's watch and became natural allies of his centrist, pro-trade, "New Democrat" agenda. Of course, plenty of Internet entrepreneurs remain Republicans; George Bush has raised millions in Silicon Valley, and Republican congressmen like J.C. Watts of Oklahoma have made pilgrimages there to court high-tech supporters. But Witchel and his fellow PAC.com members share a Northern California ethos that makes them culturally out of tune with traditional Republican values. PAC.commers say they care about choice and the environment. They don't want the Ten Commandments posted in schools. They love making money and are perfectly comfortable doing it alongside homosexuals and foreigners. What they see in Gore and the New Democrats are politicians who will not only respect their style but who will also make sure that their industry stays as unregulated, un-unionized and untaxed as possible.
Already, PAC.com has established what Randlett calls "a strategic co-marketing agreement" with the New Democrat Network, a group of pro-business Capitol Hill Democrats who borrow freely from the metaphors and values of the New Economy in their quest to modernize their party and wean it away from the labor unions and old-line liberals. In just four years, billing itself as "a venture capital fund for the Democratic Party," the group has become the largest caucus in the House, with 65 members. It now has 14 New Democrat Senators as well, and it runs its own PAC and recruits, promotes and finances promising centrist candidates. Simon Rosenberg, 35, the president and founder of the New Democrat Network, has made alliances with Silicon Valley a central part of his political strategy from the beginning. Rosenberg recognizes that Internet entrepreneurs need politicians, as Newell says, in order "to be in the conversation." They want access, relationships and connections in Washington.
There are plenty of issues on the table in Washington right now - Internet taxation, privacy regulations, export controls, visas for high-tech immigrant workers -- that Witchel and his group might want to weigh in on. But the PAC.commers insist that they're less interested in short-term lobbying for a specific agenda than in building networks of influence. "Look at where the great power bases of the world are," argues Witchel. "One is in venture capital. Another is in Washington, D.C. Just as I spend an enormous amount of time getting to know investment bankers before I actually need their money, I do the same with politicians."
Behind Witchel's approach is a firm belief that Internet businesses are models for how all social and political institutions can work more effectively. The young entrepreneurs of PAC.com tend to use the buzz words of the Internet economy to describe every facet of life. They want to "disintermediate" political go-betweens and substitute their own networks for established political machines. They want to "identify an expanded target market" and then "aggregate high-net-worth individuals" to change the base of support for the Democratic Party. As Newell boasts, PAC.com's modest goal is to "transform the business of politics and the politics of business."
In the end, Newell says, politics is the same as investment banking: "You have a product, you have to go out and raise money." He chuckles. "PAC.com is just old-fashioned grass-roots politics -- grass-roots organizing of millionaires."
PAC.com, for the moment, eschews soft-money donations -- the uncapped gifts to political parties rather than individual candidates -- but other high-tech figures have begun experimenting with the system. Marc Andreessen, the 29-year-old founder of Netscape, chairman of Loudcloud and ber-geek, is part of PAC.com's broader network. He has been hanging out with Vice President Al Gore for years and recently dropped a quarter of a million dollars on the Democratic National Committee. It is, Andreessen admits, "a lot" by the standards of politics. "But in my world," he adds, "if I invested just $250,000 in a new company, they might think I wasn't all that serious."
The difference between the value of money in Silicon Valley and in Washington -- what Andreessen calls "arbitrage" -- gets the attention of young entrepreneurs.If you think there's a lot of money in politics now," Andreessen says, "you haven't seen anything yet."
In the world view of PAC.com, that's nothing to be afraid of; politicians are merely the last ones to get dealt into the game. After all, in the New Economy, argues Witchel, everyone from receptionists to C.E.O.'s is getting paid in stock already. "It's just the way we do business," he declares. "Doesn't it make sense for everyone to participate in the same system?"
Campaign-finance watchdogs certainly don't think so. At a time when the market's reach into every corner of civic life seems almost unchecked, critics ask, why make politics, too, dependent on stock prices? "Candidates are already treated as commodities to be invested in; we might as well slap logos on them," says Rosenkranz. "Contributing stock is the perfect completion of the circle."
Witchel himself is torn. He'll exalt the power of skyrocketing stock options one minute, then turn around and critique the culture that has grown up around them. "The thing about Silicon Valley that's a problem for me," he says, "is when it's just about money. It's spiritually bankrupt. People get rich, they start to smell like money, dress like money. It makes the whole culture ugly and hollow."
Perhaps that's what politics offers to the callow entrepreneurs of Silicon Valley: a spiritual dimension, a meaningful, civic-minded pursuit beyond the world of business and money. But first they have to buy their way in.

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: At N.Y.U. Law School on Sept. 7;
Conference on Owning Homes

 BODY:
A conference on the possibilities for expanding home ownership in New York City and across the country is scheduled for Sept. 7 at the New York University School of Law.
Spurred by the strong economy, innovative lending practices and public-private partnerships to create affordable housing, "home ownership in the United States has reached record levels in recent years," said Michael Schill, director of the N.Y.U. law school's Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy. 
 "Yet, there remains a large number of Americans who aspire to become home owners," Professor Schill said, "and ownership rates among some racial and minority groups and immigrants are much lower than those of white, native-born households."
The conference, sponsored by the N.Y.U. center, the Rutgers University Center for Urban Policy and the Fannie Mae Foundation, will feature panel discussions on reducing the cost of building affordable housing, presentations of case studies of lending strategies by small and large banks, a luncheon and, in the afternoon, a bus tour of housing developments that are sponsored by Asian Americans for Equality, many of them in downtown Manhattan.
The conference is free and open to the public, but reservations must be made by calling Kenneth Kidd at the N.Y.U. real estate center: (212) 998-6666.

HEADLINE: FILM;
Back to Hong Kong, Where the Action Is

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER; Mark Landler is the Hong Kong correspondent for The New York Times.

DATELINE: HONG KONG

 BODY:
WHEN Stanley Tong left his hometown for Hollywood in 1996, Hong Kong's film industry was headed for a crack-up as spectacular as anything in a Jackie Chan movie.
Box office revenue was plummeting, scripts were threadbare and rampant piracy was driving a whole generation of movie-watchers away from theaters. Demoralized by the grinding pace and stultifying atmosphere of Hong Kong, local filmmakers fled this former British colony faster than the British themselves. 
 Mr. Tong, a 40-year-old former stuntman who directed Mr. Chan in hyper-kinetic Hong Kong action films like "Rumble in the Bronx" (1996) and "Police Story III: Supercop" (1992), did not easily find success in the United States. His first American film, "Mr. Magoo,' (1997) a $30 million Disney remake of the 1960's cartoon about a crotchety, near-sighted old goof, left audiences as befuddled as its hapless hero.
Now, Mr. Tong has returned to Hong Kong and is back on familiar ground -- shooting an action film about the Chinese police busting a smuggling ring.
"I went to America because I wanted to learn how to make Hollywood movies," Mr. Tong said. "But I always wanted to come back to where I grew up. I want to make Chinese films for an international audience."
Mr. Tong is one of several Hong Kong filmmakers who have come home this year. Some were disillusioned with the vagaries of Hollywood. Others have been lured by the new money that is sloshing around since the end of the Asian economic crisis. Still others missed the frenetic energy and anything-goes culture of making movies here. Whatever their reasons, these prodigal sons of Hong Kong cinema -- most are men -- hope to revive an industry that had been left for dead two years ago.
"There is an optimism here which hasn't existed for a long time," said Wouter Barendricht, a sales agent for Asian movies who runs the Hong Kong-Asia Film Financing Forum. "People were in such shock about the state of the industry that nothing happened for several years."
After tumbling to $100 million last year from $167 million in 1993, Hong Kong's box office receipts are likely to bounce back to $130 million this year, according to the Hong Kong Motion Picture Industry Association. The industry will release 130 films in 2000, one-third more than last year. At its peak, in the early 1990's, this movie-mad city cranked out 230 films a year.
Hong Kong's resurgence has been driven by several factors. After two years of recession, money is pouring back into film production. Some comes from old-line Hong Kong production companies, which are restyling themselves as Internet companies and desperately need "content." Some comes from Hollywood studios, like Columbia Pictures, which have set up local operations to finance Asian films.
The industry has also been helped by Hong Kong's belated crackdown on piracy. Under heavy pressure from the United States and the local film industry, the new Chinese government has raided the producers of illegally copied video compact discs. Movie executives say the campaign has worked: with bootleg VCD's drying up, people are paying to see popular films at the multiplex.
Harder to quantify, but also important, was Hong Kong's relatively smooth transition from British to Chinese rule. Local studios that had cut back their spending in 1997 out of fear that China might curtail freedoms relaxed after it became clear that Beijing did not plan to meddle in the territory.
Perhaps the most basic reason is better movies. After a long stretch of derivative action movies, Hong Kong is starting to turn out memorable, original films. It started with "Stormriders," a special-effects-laden fantasy directed by Andrew Lau that was a rare hit in the doldrums of 1998. And it has extended through "In the Mood for Love," a finely wrought domestic drama by Wong Kar-wai. The film won a best actor award at this year's Cannes Film Festival for Tony Leung Chiu-wai, the first for a Hong Kong actor.
Then there is "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon," the highly acclaimed martial-arts epic directed by Ang Lee ("The Ice Storm," "Sense and Sensibility"), which just has been named the closing night film for the New York Film Festival on Oct. 8 and will open in New York in December.
Although strictly speaking not a Hong Kong film -- it was co-financed by Columbia and Mr. Lee is from Taiwan -- "Crouching Tiger" used a Hong Kong production crew and features two of its hottest stars, Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh.
" 'Crouching Tiger' is a milestone for the local film industry," Mr. Barendricht said. "It's an Asian film with a strong Hong Kong base. That's what this industry is increasingly going to look like."
Hong Kong films used to be filmed only within the territory and only in Cantonese, which made them difficult to market overseas. Mr. Tong recalled how difficult it was to sell early Jackie Chan movies to American studios. Not until "Rumble in the Bronx," which had dialogue in Chinese and English -- and was putatively set in New York -- did Mr. Chan break through.
The returning filmmakers are determined not to be parochial. Mr. Tong is shooting his new film, "China Strike Force," in Chinese and English (less challenging than it sounds, given its lengthy action sequences). He also chose Shanghai as the location, partly because it is cheaper than Hong Kong, but also because he wanted to get to know mainland China better.
"Of the world's major film industries, Hong Kong has the smallest home market," Mr. Tong said. "If you have a movie that only works in Hong Kong, you are dead before you start. If we can get good distribution in China, it will be our biggest market in 20 years."
Mr. Tong knows the theme of his movie will play well with the Chinese authorities. The fight against smuggling and other forms of corruption is a hot button with the Communist leaders, including President Jiang Zemin and Prime Minister Zhu Rongji, both of whom are former mayors of Shanghai.
Peter Chan is another local director who came back to Hong Kong with a view to expanding the industry's horizons. Mr. Chan, 37, spent three years in Hollywood, where he directed Kate Capshaw in "The Love Letter" (1999). He recently started a Hong Kong-based company, Applause Pictures, that will develop pan-Asian pictures. Among his first projects are films by mainland Chinese and Thai directors.
Mr. Chan said the best Asian films increasingly travel across borders. A recent, if somewhat mournful, example was a low-rent Japanese horror film, "The Ring," which managed to clobber its local competition to become one of Hong Kong's highest-grossing films in 1999.
Applause Pictures is backed by Star East, a Hong Kong company that is transforming itself into a one-stop shop for Asian entertainment on the Internet. It plans to produce movies and television shows, sell merchandise and create Web sites for performers throughout the region. What Star East needs -- and what Mr. Chan will happily supply -- are movies to fill all these distribution channels.
I could have come back, hired the 10 best directors in Hong Kong and set about rebuilding the golden age of the Hong Kong cinema," Mr. Chan said over a cup of coffee in the gilded lobby of the Peninsula Hotel here. "But I don't believe there can be another golden age."
Like Mr. Tong, Mr. Chan said Hong Kong -- with a population of 6.8 million -- was simply too small to recapture its once dominant role in the Asian film industry. On the other hand, its marquee directors, crackerjack production crews and deep pools of capital make it a natural hub for a regional industry.
Not all Hong Kong filmmakers have given up on the idea of a new golden age. Another of the returnees, Tsui Hark, the acclaimed director of "Once Upon a Time in China" (1991), recently finished shooting a fantasy film (as yet untitled) that is a sequel to his 1983 classic, "Zu, Warriors From the Magic Mountain." Using the latest in computer-generated special effects but drawing on a 500-year-old Chinese legend, Mr. Tsui hopes to bring a world of mythical warriors soaring above mist-shrouded mountains to a new generation of moviegoers.
Although it was filmed in Beijing, "Zu" is a typical Hong Kong production. It was shot on a tight budget and an even tighter 45-day schedule that required the cast and crew to work round the clock. On one particularly grueling day, Mr. Tsui slept fitfully in a chair next to the set, while an exhausted crew set up a shot involving the film's hero and heroine soaring through the heavens.
Such brutal schedules used to be common here because of the large volume of productions and the relatively small number of actors and directors. This contributed to the poor quality of Hong Kong films, because directors often began shooting with only the semblance of a script. Scenes were often added or cut willy-nilly to suit the schedules of double-booked stars.
Here again, Hollywood's influence is making itself felt. Mr. Tsui, who spent two years in the United States making Jean-Claude Van Damme films ("Double Team," 1997, and "Knock Off," 1998), said he now worked with finished screenplays. Mr. Tsui also immersed himself in American production techniques and brought some back to Asia. The special effects designers on "Zu" are from the United States. And despite the film's frantic schedule, Mr. Tsui said, he has throttled back his pace to one or two movies a year, instead of several.
Mr. Tsui's other new project, "Time and Tide," exemplifies the new discipline in Hong Kong movie-making. The $3.8 million action film is backed by Columbia Pictures, which monitored every aspect of its budget and production schedule. Although the film is a shoot-'em-up about Chinese gangsters, Mr. Tsui agreed to cut some of the violence from the script to satisfy the studio.
"In Hong Kong, producers hire directors and leave them alone," said Mr. Tsui, a 50-year-old whose wild hair and unlit cigar make him look like an enfant terrible. "But in Hollywood, they want to know what the story is about. They're very focused on details."
If Mr. Lee's "Crouching Tiger" is an indication, the discipline of Hollywood may result in better films. But Barbara Robinson, the managing director of Columbia Pictures Film Production Asia, notes that old habits are hard to break.
"While these directors know what it takes to make a Hollywood movie, it doesn't follow that they will stick to those principles back here, if they can get away with it," she said.
Mr. Tsui, for one, seems like a grudging convert. Although he concedes that Hong Kong's film industry was almost killed by bad movies, he still sees merit in its frenetic, on-the-fly culture. And while he welcomes Hollywood's money, he does not want to create a Hollywood of the East.
"All the studio ideas come from video stores," he said. "I think it's very silly."

Hertz Raises Rates And Others Follow

 BODY:
Car rental rates jumped last month, with Hertz taking the first step and the other national companies following immediately. Hertz, usually the industry pacesetter, announced a $3 daily increase for noncorporate renters, effective July 14. The weekly rate for cars reserved 21 days in advance rose $10, and the weekly rate for reservations made at shorter range generally went up $20. Lauren E. Garvey, a spokeswoman, said that rises in vehicle prices, wages and interest rates required the increases, although the company had record earnings for the most recent quarter.
A week's rental of a midsize Ford in Orlando, Fla., Ms. Garvey said, will cost $271.99 before taxes, up from $261.99, with a reservation made 21 days ahead. The same rental at La Guardia Airport in New York will be $489.99 before taxes instead of $469.99, regardless of reservation time. 
 Avis said it was matching the rates, as did Budget and Dollar. Thrifty said a survey of 15 cities where it had franchises showed rates had stayed the same in six, had risen in four and had dropped in five.

HEADLINE: Plum I. May Test 'Mad' Sheep

BYLINE: By JOHN RATHER

 BODY:
NO animal ever leaves the Plum Island Animal Disease Center, the Department of Agriculture laboratory sequestered off the tip of the North Fork. But until recently, pigs, cattle and other large creatures that the scientists use to study diseases arrived alive.
That will change very soon if the Department of Agriculture moves forward with an emergency plan to slaughter 355 sheep from Vermont and ship their frozen carcasses to the high-security laboratory for incineration. 
 Agriculture officials believe the imported sheep may be carrying a new and deadly variant of mad-cow disease, which devastated cattle in Britain during the 1990's and has been linked to the deaths of more than 70 Europeans, most of them Britons, who ate infected meat.
The sheep, two flocks of East Friesians, are not dead yet. Farm officials in Vermont have monitored the animals since the original sheep were imported from Belgium and the Netherlands four years ago, and believe they are infected. But the owners say the sheep are healthy, and have blocked the slaughter in Federal court.
The stakes are high. Some researchers warn -- though such estimates include many variables -- that anywhere from a few thousand to half a million Britons could die over the next 30 years from Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, the human form of mad-cow disease, which in effect eats holes in the brain.
Plum Island, the Agriculture Department officials say, is the safest and best-equipped place to dispose of the suspect sheep and obliterate any chance that the disease, which may incubate for years, will spread in the United States.
The incineration would mark a new direction for Plum Island and its first direct connection to research into transmissible spongiform encephalopathy, or T.S.E., a disease category that includes mad-cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy, and scrapie, a fatal sheep disease.
Earlier plans to ferry live sheep to the island for long-term observation were apparently scrapped. But even carcasses potentially carrying a disease that has caused death, tumult and huge economic loss in Europe are not entirely welcome on the Island.
The shipment is vigorously opposed by Representative Michael P. Forbes, who accused the Agriculture Department of trying to minimize the event, withholding information and ignoring opposition on eastern Long Island to expanded lab operations.
"They tried to sneak this through in the dead of night," he said.
Officials in the Town of Southold are also unhappy and a bit unsure what may be afoot. "We're getting six different stories from six different agencies," said the town supervisor, Jean Cochrane. "I am not happy."
Mr. Forbes said it would be the first time dead animals had been delivered to Plum Island for disposal and could set a precedent that is inappropriate for a government research center in a densely populated region.
Taking tissue samples before incineration for later study would also involve the lab in animal diseases that could be fatal to humans, only months after the Clinton administration, at Mr. Forbes's urging, withdrew funds to make the center the country's first Biosafety Level 4 laboratory.
Level 4 facilities, the highest level, provide protection for scientists researching virulent animal viruses capable of causing human deaths. Plum Island is currently a Level 3 laboratory, which handles less dangerous material.
Dr. Linda A. Detwieler, a senior staff veterinarian for emergency programs for the Department of Agriculture, said the sheep-tissue studies did not require a Level 4 lab because they did not involve airborne viruses. She said a person would have to eat the tissues to be infected.
She also said the shipment would be an isolated event -- not likely to be repeated -- to take advantage of two incinerators at Plum Island that are routinely used to dispose of animals intentionally infected with viruses as part of the center's research. Filtering systems remove particulates from air emissions and ashes are treated prior to disposal.
Incineration at the center would be an extra precaution against allowing a sheep version of spongiform encephalopathy into the United States, where mad-cow disease has never been observed, Dr. Detwieler said.
In Europe, primarily in Britain, more than 176,000 cattle have died from mad-cow disease and four million cattle were destroyed as a precaution. Experts believe the disease is linked to contaminated feed made from meat and bone meal that contains an abnormal form of a protein called a prion.
In many cases, cattle carcasses were incinerated in portable units. (In one macabre instance, a company proposed generating electricity with heat from masses of burning carcasses.) But American officials said they wanted a highly controlled disposal technique to minimize risks.
An Agriculture Department spokesman, Patrick Collins, said the Plum Island center was "uniquely positioned" for the task of incinerating the Vermont sheep. "Plum Island was designed for this kind of stuff and they have been doing it for four or five decades," he said.
The laboratory normally incinerates about 250 animals a year, mostly pigs.
At the moment the sheep in Vermont are in a legal limbo. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman ordered their seizure last month after tests on four of the sheep showed variations of the fatal sheep disease scrapie, which government veterinarians fear could be a form of spongiform encephalopathy.
Government officials are especially concerned because, unlike the path of the disease in cattle, the sheep variety may be transmitted from infected ewes to their offspring.
Last week the Vermont sheep remained in quarantine while the flocks' owners, Larry and Linda Faillace and Houghton Freeman, appealed a federal judge's ruling that upheld the government's seizure.
Mr. Freeman said the owners doubted the accuracy of the tests on the four sheep and believed the government was looking for an excuse to slaughter the sheep.
"They came in here waving these test results and said, 'Either you turn the sheep over to us voluntarily or we will come and get them,' " he said. "Yet all these sheep were imported with U.S.D.A. approval, and that wasn't easy to get."
The Agriculture Department officials said the flocks fell under suspicion in 1998, when the European Union said it could not guarantee that the parent sheep had not eaten infected feed prior to export.
Mr. Freeman said he had never seen signs of scrapie or any behavior that could indicate sheep in his flock were infected with any spongiform encephalopathy.
Milk from the ewes, which produce 10 times more than domestic breeds, is used to make cheese. Mr. Freeman said he usually slaughtered all but a few rams for meat. Vermont health officials have issued a health caution about the cheese, and no meat has left the farms.
The owners have also asked permission to return the flocks to Belgium, and Belgian officials have also asked for the return of some animals for testing.
Agriculture officials said that under their current plan, the sheep would be killed at a laboratory in Newburgh, N.Y., where, they said, 21 sheep from a third Vermont flock from imported stock had already been killed and incinerated. The carcasses would then be double-wrapped in plastic, boxed, frozen and shipped inside a refrigerated truck that would be transported from New London, Conn., to Plum Island on a special ferry. The truck would stay permanently on the island, officials said.
Not all eastern Long Island officials oppose the shipment.
"I have every confidence the officials on Plum island can handle the animals and the disease," said David Kapell, the mayor of Greenport. "And I am sure I speak for the majority of the people in Greenport."
Many Plum Island employees live in the village.

HEADLINE: Workouts That Fit the Lives Of Harried Commuters

BYLINE: By ROBERT WORTH

DATELINE: LARCHMONT

 BODY:
EVERY weekday evening, as the northbound train stops at Larchmont and exhales a crowd of weary commuters, a dozen or so head for the New York Sports Club less than a quarter mile away.
This has become a ritual at stations along the suburban lines that fan out from Manhattan near which two major fitness club chains have been building or buying facilities over the last five years. Operating clubs in the city as well as the suburbs, the chains hope to lure commuters by offering a choice of exercise in either spot. 
 "It's definitely an urban-suburban strategy," said Alex Alimanestianu, chief development officer for Town Sports International, the owner of New York Sports Clubs, the largest chain in the New York area. "We've built our cluster of clubs with a view to putting them where people live and work in a defined geographic area."
Town Sports, which operates 70 clubs in the New York metropolitan region, has bought clubs close to the train stations and major highways in Scarsdale, Larchmont, Mamaroneck, White Plains and Croton. Mr. Alimanestianu said that it was hard to find space close to train stations, but the rents were reasonable "because retailers generally want to be on the main street."
Town Sports also owns clubs close to Penn Station and Grand Central Terminal to give commuters the option of exercising before they catch the train.
"That's really been a cardinal principle of our site selection," he said. "In any suburban location we want to be close to the transportation hubs, be they bus or train lines or the PATH train in New Jersey."
Bally Total Fitness, the nation's largest health club chain, has used the same approach. The company owns 40 clubs in the vicinity of New York City, including three in Westchester, and plans to build more.
"We locate clubs where they can fit into the lives of members most naturally," said David Southern, an executive vice president at Bally.
Studies have shown that health clubs draw 90 percent of their membership within a 10- to 15-minute walking distance, said Bill Howland, director of research at the International Health, Racquet and Sports Club Association, a nonprofit group that tracks the industry.
"This club is on my route," said Valerie Kirby, a dark-haired woman in a blue Nike workout suit, as she pumped her arms back and forth on a Lifefitness crosstrainer at the New York Sports Club in Larchmont.
A banker with NatWest, Ms. Krauss said she catches the 5:13 train from Grand Central to Larchmont, then walks down the hill past the club on her way home. "I'd rather go here than in the city, where I'm not sure I'll get to the train on time," she said.
Like most commuters, Ms. Krauss has a narrow window for exercise. She has to be home by 7, when the nanny who takes care of her two children leaves. (The nanny, who is also a club member, then comes the Larchmont club for her own workout.) The club's site near the train station and just off Interstate 95 allows her to exercise without going out of her way.
If her schedule changes and she is left with free time in the city, she can use another of the club's outlets, a few blocks from her office at 41st and Park Avenue. Her husband is also a member, she said, and he prefers to use one of the city outlets.
So many of the Larchmont club's members are commuters that the train times dictate the ebb and flow of people here, the club's fitness manager, Geoffrey Braham, said.
"With the train schedule, you kind of know -- the 6:31 pulls in, and you get a lot of people," Mr. Braham said.
"I can see five or six people who took the train out here with me," said Kermit Patterson, a burly college student from Larchmont who is spending the summer working for an investment bank in the city and spends two hours at the club every day after work.
The Larchmont club is typical in another sense: it was owned by an independent operator until New York Sports bought it and remodeled it two years ago.
Although health clubs remain a highly fragmented industry, several large chains, including Town Sports and Bally, have been aggressively buying up independent clubs and smaller chains. Of the roughly 12,500 commercial clubs in the United States, 30 to 40 percent are owned by chains, up from about 25 percent five years ago, said Rick Devereux, director of operations at the international sports club association.
The expanding suburban market has accelerated the pace of consolidation, because unlike their competitors, the chains can offer members the choice of a workout in any of dozens of regional facilities. All of New York Sports' membership plans, which run from $67 to $83 a month with initiation fees of between $149 and $199, allow members access to all the company's clubs, said Jodie Meltzer, the Westchester area manager for Town Sports.
"It is a leveragable selling feature if you can say we can take care of you in Manhattan and in Rye," Mr. Howland said.
Town Sports built its first suburban club in Great Neck on Long Island in 1986, Mr. Alimanestianu said. "We noticed pretty quickly that people joining in the city were using the Great Neck club and people in Great Neck were using the city locations," Mr. Alimanestianu said. Half of Town Sports' 100 locations nationwide are now in suburbs.
The company's expansion did not take off, however, until the mid- 1990's, when health club membership soared, fueled by the economic boom and the growing popularity of cardiovascular exercise.
Club membership soared to 30.6 million members nationwide in 1999, from 20.7 million in 1990, reported Harvey Lauer, president of American Sports Data of Hartsdale, a company that specializes in sports and fitness research.

HEADLINE: An Artist Whose Canvas Is a Cluttered Taco Stand

BYLINE: By DEBRA WEST

DATELINE: PATTERSON

 BODY:
ROSEMARY JAMISON, a Texan who came to New York in the 1960's in search of a bigger canvas for her art, opened a restaurant here and has been filling it ever since with things like fake shark heads and black lights, bird cages and oil paintings, Life Magazines, pool ladders, armless mannequins and oddities of all sorts.
And, oh yes, she serves tacos, too. 
 Walking into Rosemary's Texas Taco on Route 22 at Haviland Hollow Road is a little like falling through Alice's rabbit hole: it's dark, it's crowded with non sequiturs, and it feels like a flashback.
"Oh, I studied art in college," said Ms. Jamison, 58, her drawl still evident. "But it was like making a little charcoal sketch of a cow skull for days, and I want big."
For about 22 years this restaurant has been Ms. Jamison's art project, first love and home (for nine years she had another spot farther up the road). With Route 22 poised for more development, however, the restaurant building and the land is for sale. The landlord, Janet Hansen, said she wanted to sell now while the economy was good.
"It's a great spot," Ms. Hansen said. "Rosemary has been doing very well here, and she doesn't want to leave.
"I feel heartbroken. I wish she could afford to buy the property herself, but she can't."
Ms. Jamison, who swore off marriage as a girl and calls her art and her waitresses her babies, said the asking price for the property was $324,000, and that it was just too high for her.
"I don't make any money here," she said. "This is a labor of love."
If that is the case, then love must be pink and aquamarine with a hearty dose of glitter.
Everything Ms. Jamison touches she turns to art. Her sidewalk is more Peter Max than Putnam County. Her vehicles are decorative first, functional second.
Her 1961 Chevrolet Apache pick-up truck, no longer used, is intricately outfitted with beads, dolls and various knickknacks.
Her converted small school bus, which she drives to haul her finds back from the Patterson flea market each weekend ("I'm always the first one there"), is also a mass of color.
Her backyard is faux beach club. "It's like you're in the bottom of a pool," she said. "I want people to feel cool and refreshed."
Her bathroom: "Pretend you fell into an aquarium."
But no canvas is more artfully crafted than the 4-foot-11 Ms. Jamison herself.
Twice a week, she colors her hair purple, using a mix of "trench mouth medicine and manic panic" hair dye "to give it more of a violet touch than pure purple," she said.
She bats her three-inch-long eyelashes knowingly, revealing an arc of black eyeshadow, while she talks about her dreams of franchising Rosemary's Texas Taco.
"Don't you think there's room for some competition to Taco Bell?" she asked hopefully, while acknowledging that it might be difficult to duplicate the charms of Rosemary's.
Then she disclosed her true secret hope for the future of her restaurant.
"Maybe nobody will buy it, and I can stay," she whispered. DEBRA WEST

HEADLINE: Putnam's Growth Poses a Threat To the Charms Of a Rural Road

BYLINE: By DEBRA WEST

DATELINE: BREWSTER

 BODY:
THERE was a time when the advertising slogan of the Putnam County Visitors' Bureau, "Where the Country Begins," seemed the perfect description of Route 22, the main road here.
Drivers heading north from New York City and Westchester could jostle with traffic on the parkways and then race up I-684, where no matter how fast they were driving, it wasn't fast enough for the tailgater behind them. But once they crossed the bridge over the Croton River and got onto Route 22, they could relax. 
 The two-lane road, lush with swamp maples, oak trees and untamed shrubs, first forced drivers to slow to country pace, then opened up to a vista of old-time American enterprise. A drive-in hamburger stand, diners, bait and tackle shops, a survivalist's outlet, a cattle ranch, a taco restaurant with more kitsch than kitchen and even a modest ski slope add to the hokey charm of the road.
These days, however, suburbia has caught up with Route 22. Traffic has slowed from a leisurely trot to a frustrating crawl, and the State Department of Transportation, which has been contemplating widening the road for at least 15 years, says that, come fall, it will unveil its plan for expansion at a series of public hearings.
"It's about time," said Celeste Bachrach, 48, an art teacher from Southeast (more commonly known by its mailing address, Brewster). "They should have widened it a long time ago. What were they waiting for?"
Like many in the towns of Southeast and Patterson, Mrs. Bachrach settled in Putnam County because it was a fast drive to Westchester, where her husband works.
"The only reason I got him to move to Brewster was because we could live right off Route 22," said Mrs. Bachrach, who moved from Mount Kisco in 1987. "Now, that traffic just makes me crazy. I will go to any length to avoid 22."
And she means any length.
Instead of going to a Chinese restaurant less than a half mile away on Route 22, for instance, Mrs. Bachrach drives to Danbury, a round trip of 18 miles, for takeout.
"It takes me forever to get there and back," she said. "But I get so aggravated and my level of stress gets so high in traffic, it's worth it to me to take a little longer."
Route 22 was once a main thoroughfare from New York City to Canada, but over the years it has been bisected and marginalized throughout Westchester. In Putnam County, however, it remains a major north-south road. It is also the state's easternmost major road, making it attractive to drivers heading to New England.
The section of the road the state is now considering widening is just 3.1 miles long. It starts at the end of I-684 and goes to Doansburg Road, said Brian J. Doherty the Route 22 project manager for the Department of Transportation.
The proposed $25 million project would widen the road to four lanes and add a median divider from the Interstate to the first stop light, at Milltown Road. The four lanes would continue but instead of having a raised median it would be divided by a center turning lane. The project would end just past the State Police barracks.
The project, which has been discussed since the mid-1980's, has been held up by, among other things, concerns about New York City's water. The section of Route 22 to be widened is bounded on both sides by reservoirs that are part of the Croton Reservoir System. To the east, just beyond the road, lies the East Branch Reservoir. To the west lies the Bog Brook Reservoir.
In the fall the Department of Transportation will complete its environmental assessment. Public hearings will be held, and the state will evaluate comments. If the plan is approved, construction is expected to begin in 2002, Mr. Doherty said.
When construction is contemplated in watershed territory, however, nothing moves quickly. One 1997 proposal involved filling in a portion of the Bog Brook Reservoir.
"When we saw it, we said 'Oh wow!,"' said Geoffrey C. Ryan, a spokesman for the New York City Department of Environmental Protection. "We are certainly not interested in having any incursion in our reservoir."
So the state scrapped that plan.
While the issues are being resolved, traffic continues to grow. Last year, there were about 26,000 cars on the 3.1 mile stretch of road each day. The road averages about 85 accidents a year, Mr. Doherty said.
Traffic is expected to increase by 1 percent every year for the next 20 years, Mr. Doherty said, as a housing boom continues.
In 1990 Putnam County, which has six towns and is the state's smallest county, had 83,941 residents. By July 1998, the population had jumped to 93,358, and demographers expect another big jump in the 2000 census.
In Dutchess County, the next county north, the population rose 3.4 percent from 1990 to 1999, to 268,237. But in Dutchess, new housing permits suggest that the boom is just beginning. There are 106 major residential projects (of 25 residences or more) planned or under construction in Dutchess, said Lindsay Carille, a junior planner in the county's Planning Department.
More houses translate into more traffic.
"The traffic really started to get bad in the 80's with the last economic boom we had," Lois C. Zutell, the Southeast town supervisor, said. "For the amount of commuters we have now, I don't think you have any question that this road has to be fixed. The inconvenience it is causing is just unbelievable. Plus the Friday afternoon traffic with all the New Yorkers going up to the Berkshires is just too much."
But a lot of those weekend commuters like Route 22 for its old-fashioned feel.
Red Rooster, a drive-in that started as an ice cream parlor in the early 60's, is a particular favorite of the country house set. On Friday evenings and again on Sunday afternoons the parking lot fills with Range Rovers, Lexus sport utility vehicles and Mercedes convertibles, whose drivers make a ritual of stopping off during their trips from Manhattan to the Berkshires or Millwood or some other lush country haunt.
"Our clientele is very exclusive," said Jack Sypek, 62, a manager and one-time part owner who has worked at Red Rooster for 29 years. "Doctors, lawyers, movie stars, they all come here. Kevin Bacon, Michael J. Fox, Sam Waterson, James Earl Jones, you name it, they stop here. They like the atmosphere."
There's a lot to like. Red Rooster, which regularly gets good ratings in Zagat's dining guides and has been voted one of the nation's best hamburger havens by those who vote on such things, is steeped in nostalgia.
Clean-cut teenagers in crisp white uniforms serve fast food with manners and enthusiasm straight out of the 50's. Customers squeeze into the tiny vestibule that was added in the 70's and then bring their food out to one of the 25 picnic tables. Adults eat and chat while children climb a graceful apple tree. There's room to walk the dog and a somewhat faded miniature golf course, which features one hole with Porky Pig (par 3) and another with Bugs Bunny (par 2).
Tim Pasik, who lives on 72nd Street and Park Avenue in Manhattan and drives with his three children, his wife and two nannies to his country home in Salisbury on most weekends, looks forward to his weekly stop at the Red Rooster.
"If we get here in time for dinner, we do dinner," said Mr. Pasik, 40, a reinsurance underwriter. "If not, we get ice cream and coffee. We stop here all the time. We wouldn't miss it."
Under the proposed widening plan, Route 22 would have to veer more to the Red Rooster side of the road (the east side) than it does now in order to preserve a pre-Revolutionary War graveyard just a bit north. Red Rooster would lose most of its parking lot and all of its miniature golf course, Mr. Sypek said.
"Don't worry, we have plans," Mr. Sypek said. "We own the land next to us, and we'll rebuild."
But it remains to be seen whether making changes to Red Rooster, which, Mr. Sypek said, is now "doing as much business as we can handle," will affect its fortunes. After all, one of Red Rooster's charms is that it's not something designed to look retro. It's the real thing.
"They don't pay you for loss of business," Mr. Sypek said. "They just pay you for what they take."
Edward R. Heelan, president of Heelan Realty and Development Corporation in Brewster, is skeptical that the road expansion will take place anytime soon.
"I've heard that before," he said. "They've been singing that song for 20 years."
He thinks the state's delay on the road expansion is hurting Putnam County's tax base. Businesses are going elsewhere because they don't like the traffic problem on Route 22. Mr. Heelan represents the owners of 1,000 acres of land that is currently for sale along Route 22.
"You need commercial development to offset all the residential development that's going on," Mr. Heelan said. "Route 22 is a prime avenue for that. I took out a client today who wanted to build a 60,000-square-foot facility. He wouldn't even look at 22. There is a cloud hanging over it. People want to know, Where will the road go, where will the turnarounds be, what will traffic be like?"
He added that the planned expansion doesn't go far enough.
"When they finish up to Doansburg Road, they'll have to start the next section, up through Patterson," he said.
Some people fear that if the road is widened it will begin to resemble Central Avenue in Yonkers and lose its country flavor, green space and mom-and-pop shops.
"Nobody's for that," said Sean Diggin, whose family owns two motels, Heidi's Inn and the Bel Air Motor Lodge.
Heidi's, with 40 rooms, a restaurant and a pool, is old Brewster. It will benefit from road construction because the plan is to move the road away from Heidi's to straighten out a bad curve, Mr. Diggin said.
"It used to be like the Poconos, a summer resort," Mr. Diggin said. "You'd have to make reservations a year in advance."
But the Bel Air Motor Lodge, an unassuming stopover for truck drivers and construction workers, may have to close. The road will take over its parking lot and the land where its well lies.
"They say we can relocate it, but I don't know where," Mr. Diggin said.
It has been a long time since a spot alongside Route 22 was considered a summer resort. Two shopping plazas were built in the last five years, each with its own A.&P., Blockbuster Video and Dollar stores, and the plazas are just eight miles apart.
Edie Keasbey, 70, has lived in Patterson, just down the road from one of the new shopping plazas, since 1938.
She is a member of watchdog organizations like the Croton Watershed Clean Water Coalition, and for decades she has watched as farm lands sprouted housing developments, wetlands were filled in and country roads were paved over.
"Basically, improvements in roads leads to more development and more traffic and more over everything we are trying to put a brake on up here," she said. "It's such a vicious circle."

HEADLINE: Q & A/Daniel C. Esty;
Long-Term Optimist for the Environment

BYLINE: By ALAN BISBORT

 BODY:
DANIEL C. ESTY, director of the Yale Center for Environmental Law and Policy, thinks the environment will not be taken seriously around the world, until it is given a number. "What is important gets measured," Mr. Esty said, but that kind of analytical approach is rarely focused on the natural world.
Mr. Esty proposed to change all that to include the environment in the equation and the result is called the Pilot Environmental Sustainability Index. The purpose of the index, which grew out of a February workshop at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, is to "measure the ability of economies to achieve environmentally sustainable development," Mr. Esty said. In other words, it is a report card on the state of the environment in a number of countries. 
 The numbers he has crunched, obtained through the Center for International Earth Science Information Network at Columbia University, have already generated the sort of heated but healthy dialogue he had anticipated.
To create the index, Mr. Esty, his Yale colleagues, and members of the World Economic Forum's Global Leaders of Tomorrow (a select group of promising young people who, in the past, have included Bill Gates, the Treasury Secretary Larry Summers and Mr. Esty), took data from 57 countries and looked at 65 variables. The countries who were graded and then ranked were those for which reliable data existed. .
The resultis what Mr. Esty calls "something like a batting average or cumulative grade- point average."
The index hasn't been perfected, which is why it's a "pilot," said Mr. Esty, who plans to expand the survey next year to 100 countries.
A one-time administrator at the Environmental Protection Agency, Mr. Esty has put his global perspective to work locally, having served on Cheshire's Planning and Zoning Commission for five years. Describing s himself as a "short-term pessimist but long-term optimist," he said he was committed to the long haul of reversing the havoc of the "experiment" on the earth. Mr. Esty was interviewed at his New Haven office. Here are excerpts from that conversation.
Q. Your index has the United States ranked 16th. Why isn't it closer to the top?
A. If there was a direct correlation between economic wealth and environmental health, the U.S. would be tops in both. A significant percentage of reaction is "Oh my goodness, the U.S. is doing so poorly, what's going on?" But there's another reaction, particularly from Europeans who perceive us as foot-dragging on critical issues like climate change, that we are ranked as high as we are. Both myths get burst. The U.S. is riding high and everything is fine is not true, and this puts numbers to that reality. But, also the perception that the U.S. is abominable is also unveiled as not true.
Q. Were there any surprises in the results things you never suspected?
A. The biggest single surprise is how high Russia ranks at 22. We know their performance is terrible, and yet what has saved them is that they have a vast open space in Siberia. So that on certain criteria they rank high simply as a function of having Siberia. But if one looked at pollution control in Russia's cities, it's horrible. They rank at the bottom. The opposite is true in Singapore, a country we know is sophisticated in its environmental management. But Singapore is a city state that sits at the edge of sustainability on a number of issues. It has no place to put garbage, it doesn't have adequate water, it's up against critical limits. So, even excellent management does not produce a high score on the index.
Q. Can't a number of these countries with low scores be said to have inherited their problems, in that much of the worldwide environmental awareness rose only after the damage was done?
A. Some countries are still on the industrialized trajectory. One wants to get to China, Thailand, Vietnam, before they deepen their hole. One chart in the index plots competitiveness against environmental performance and what you see is that there is no trade-off; countries doing well economically take necessary environmental steps. But the chart also shows, clearly, that you don't get rich by getting dirty. That whole theory of development is strongly disproved.
Look at Sweden and Belgium. They're roughly the same on competitiveness, but look how much better Sweden does than Belgium on the environment. Given an equal economic success, a country can do different things to their environment. Belgium is riddled with dioxins, and it shows up on the index. Sweden is fifth, Belgium 23rd, below Russia.
Q. Isn't this is one of the more optimistic aspects of the index, that it is an ongoing thing?
A. Exactly. The truth is that as we move forward this can only improve, because we discard shaky data sets and replace them with more systematically gathered data. And we broaden the number of countries included as these countries develop the data we need. One of the positive things that came out of this were the number of countries that called, mailed, or e-mailed, saying "Why didn't you include us?" Our answer was simple: "We just don't have enough data from you." People are upset about being ranked low but it's worse to not be ranked at all, because it takes you off the list of countries taken seriously.
Q. Doesn't it sometimes feel like the human genome project of the environment?
A. It's very complex, and there's a tendency in politics and media to simplify. We're saying go the other way, accept the complexity. This index only begins to tell the story. The question it doesn't answer, yet, is "which policies matter?"
Q. What is the reaction to the index from business leaders around the world?
A. We know that a significant percent of business community takes the environment seriously. For those who do, the index is not a surprise. The brighter companies today understand that investing in the environment does not undermine their economic position. One of the things we hope to do with this index is to show that those old attitudes are not in touch with the current wisdom about how you want to promote economic development.
Think about what the developing countries' representatives were saying at the World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle: "Don't hold us to environmental standards, it'll hold us back." That's based on old, disproved economic misconceptions.

HEADLINE: LAW ENFORCEMENT;
Is Putnam the Safest County? Uh, Not Exactly

BYLINE: By AL BAKER

 BODY:
AS the parting shot in a one-page news release, it almost went unnoticed: "Putnam County is considered the safest county in the state of New York."
But from the cornfields of Tioga County, in northwest New York, to the bedroom neighborhoods of Madison County, in the geographic center of the state, the words drew a surprising response. 
 "That seems kind of braggadocio," Peter L. Ward, the chairman of the County Legislature in Tioga, said of Putnam's declaration.
The sheriff of Putnam County issued the statement in June, citing 1999 statistics in four crime categories. But in a follow-up interview, the sheriff, Robert Thouborron, admitted that his comments might have been made hastily. The state's Division of Criminal Justice Services has yet to issue its 1999 report, so Putnam's crime data cannot be compared with other counties.
"If the headline is, 'Sheriff Misleads Public,' then you got me," Mr. Thoubboron said. "We should have said we are one of the safest."
Taking credit for cutting crime is nothing new. Everyone from Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to President Clinton has done it. The political and economic benefit of a perceived sense of safety is often the motive, criminologists say.
But tiny increases or decreases in statistics, especially in counties or cities where the crime rate is already low, can cause dramatic swings in percentages that render them meaningless. For example, an increase of one violent crime a year would double the crime rate in Hamilton County but would barely be felt in a place like Yonkers.
It's not that Putnam is lying.
"When you deal with smaller jurisdictions like this, the numbers can fluctuate from year to year, quite wildly," said James Alan Fox, Lipman professor of criminal justice at Northeastern University in Boston. "You have to take not just with a grain of salt but with the whole shaker of salt claims by a county saying that they are the safest."
According to the state's most recent report in 1998, four counties in New York had lower rates of violent crime per 100,000 people than Putnam: Hamilton, Madison, Schuyler and Tioga.
Thomas M. Gifford, the chairman of the Schuyler County Legislature, said that he has known people who have moved to Schuyler from Putnam for safety.
Michael J. Maloney, the Schuyler County sheriff, said he has not studied the numbers but believes "we probably have the lowest amount of violent crime," in the state. In fact, its rate is the second lowest, after Hamilton.
"You can walk around the streets here at night all by yourself and you don't have to worry about anybody driving up to you doing bodily harm," Mr. Gifford said.
Of course, Schuyler County is so rural (it has 18,500 residents) that, as Mr. Gifford said, "a lot of the streets here don't have lights, sidewalks or pavement."
In Putnam County, with a population of 93,000, Mr. Thoubboron said robberies were cut in half, to 7 last year from 14 in 1998. That is less than the number of robberies that can occur in one night in one police precinct in the Bronx.
Burglaries, Mr. Thoubboron said, dropped by 32 percent in Putnam, to 232 last year from 302 in 1998. Motor vehicle thefts went down 53 percent in the same period, he said.
Those drops were on top of crime rates already among the state's lowest, according to the state's 1998 report on crime.
Among counties with populations between 50,000 and 100,000, Putnam had the lowest index crime rate that year, a rate calculated by adding the total number of violent crimes to property crimes, dividing by the county population and multiplying by 100,000.
Mr. Thoubboron ended his June 8 statement by saying Putnam's decrease "is in large part due to the professional and dedicated law enforcement officers in the various departments that serve our community." Translation: good cops.
But experts say crime often runs in cycles, its rates more a product of sociological trends than enforcement strategies. If a county wants to claim to be the safest, it must be safe in all areas of crime, not just four or five categories, said Alfred Blumstein, a criminologist at Carnegie Melon University.
"The one I find most reliable is homicide rates," Mr. Blumstein said.
Putnam County had four homicides in 1999, according to the records provided by Mr. Thoubboron. One case, on New Year's Eve, was memorable for its horror: a Carmel woman killed her two sons, her husband and herself.
When asked to recall the last homicide in Madison County (population 70,000) Rocco J. DiVeronica, the chairman of the county's Board of Supervisors, conceded he was stumped.
"You mean just a regular outright murder?" Mr. DiVeronica said. "I don't know. About 13 years ago we had a brother killed a brother.
"Boy, I know there's been some suicides," he added, pausing to think for a moment. "That's an interesting question."

Using the Internet to Lower Costs and Sell Houses

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE

 BODY:
IT didn't take long for DeLanee J. Collins to decide to sell her house in Tinton Falls through an Internet brokerage company rather than a traditional one. For the technologically savvy Ms. Collins the reason was simple: to save money.
That was the promise of the company she used, Your Home Direct.com, based in West Long Branch. The company began operations in March under the premise that by linking the Internet with a range of real estate services it could make the process of buying and selling a home more efficient and less costly. 
 Depending on the services provided through its licensed real estate agents under three different sales programs, Your Home Direct charges 2 to 3.9 percent of the sales price. This compares with the 6 percent commission that has become the industry standard for traditional brokerage companies. The Web addresses for Your Home Direct are www.yhd.com or yourhome direct.com.
Ms. Collins listed her home with Your Home Direct after hearing its ad on the radio and calling for a demonstration. "It seemed like a win-win situation," Ms. Collins said, without "any greater risk than I would have with a traditional brokerage." Ms. Collins, 36, a single parent with two sons, is an international project manager at Avaya Communications in Holmdel, formerly Lucent Technologies
Jason and Jennifer Walk bought Ms. Collins's contemporary with three bedrooms and a loft. "I saw a virtual tour of the house and fell in love with it," Mr. Walk said. "From my perspective I wasn't gaining or losing anything by buying this way."
There are a handful of traditional discount brokerages in New Jersey, including Lake Realty in Brick. Since the agency's founding in 1993, Sherif Selim, the owner, said he had been charging commissions ranging from 0.75 percent to 3.75 percent to sellers in Ocean and Monmouth Counties.
But Your Home Direct bills itself as the first full-service licensed Internet-based company in the state.
Internet real estate sites have been around for several years and have evolved from offering bare-bones property listings to providing lots of features, including data on neighborhoods as well as links to lenders and house inspectors. While such sites can save home buyers and sellers time by enabling them to narrow their search for houses and services online, many ultimately steered prospective buyers to traditional brokerage companies.
With Your Home Direct, Glenn E. Cohen, a 38-year-old lawyer, has expanded the concept of e-brokerage by combining the Internet's time-saving features with flesh-and-blood brokers. Earlier, Mr. Cohen worked for his family's brokerage company in Shrewsbury, selling subdivision sites to developers.
Initially backed by $2.8 million from investors, including the state's largest home builder, K. Hovnanian Enterprises of Red Bank, Your Home Direct secured an additional $8 million in venture capital and established five offices in the state. It has 70 employees, 50 of them licensed agents. Since it started, the company has listed about 1,000 houses, mostly resales but a few new homes, Mr. Cohen said. Buyers have signed contracts on 275 and closed on 85, he said.
The company says its fees are low because its overhead is low, its brokers spend far fewer hours than conventional brokers in showing property, and they work on a salaried rather than on a commission basis. They don't attend closings or home inspections, as many conventional brokers do, and in some cases they don't accompany the buyer on visits to the houses. In May the company added a mortgage subsidiary, yhd Capital.com.
Conventional brokers questions whether services like Your Home Direct maintain large enough staffs of knowledgeable brokers to keep customers up-to-date about local market conditions. The suggestion is that a conventional broker might be able to get a better price for the seller.
Your Home Direct replies that the time-saving feature of the Internet used in combination with real brokers serves customers well. "Without the efficiency of the Internet we don't exist, and without the services we don't exist," Mr. Cohen said.
THE company joins a growing number of e-brokerage companies that have sprung up across the nation in the last two years as a "bricks and clicks" alternative to the conventional "bricks and mortar" way of buying and selling homes.
Others include zipRealty.com in Berkeley, Calif.; eRealty.com in Houston; and Homebytes in Richmond, Va. Last month, Homebytes became the first e-brokerage company to be licensed in every state; it intends to be fully operational in New Jersey by the end of September.
While some companies like Your Home Direct offer a range of fees based on the services the sellers want, others charge a set price. Homebytes, for instance, charges sellers a one-time fee of $499, which includes listing the home on the local Multiple Listing Service, the bible of available properties, and establishing a sales price. The company's agents also advise sellers on how to sell their houses via telephone and the Internet.
Referring to discount e-brokerage companies generally, Dennis R. Cronk, the president of the National Association of Realtors in Washington, said: "If they fit some consumers' needs, they will be utilized. But in the past discount brokerages have never reached any level of success in the business."
Walter Baczkowski Jr., the executive vice president of the New Jersey Association of Realtors in Edison, said that a "good real estate market hides many evils." The test "is how well these business models can withstand a bad economy," he said, adding that "there is only so much venture capital to go around.'
Under each of Your Home Direct's three sales programs it offers such basic services as listing the houses, with digital pictures and computerized tours on real estate Web sites, and marketing the houses through tradition print advertisements and "for sale" signs. The company prequalifies all prospective buyers and provides online links to a network of professionals.
The lowest commission Your Home Direct charges in 2 percent. For that, sellers get the basic listing services but must show their homes themselves.
For a 3 percent percent commission, an agent will provide the seller with a marketing plan and with help on setting a realistic price, will show the house and will handle all negotiations.
For a 3.9 percent commission the company will also list the home with the local Multiple Listing Service. Under this plan if the house is sold through the buyer's broker, that broker gets 2.5 percent of the 3.9 percent commission; the Your Home Direct agent gets the remaining 1.3 percent.
To sell her Tinton Falls house, Ms. Collins selected the 3 percent plan, and the house was shown to five prospective buyers, including the Walks. After negotiating to have some minor repairs done, the Walks offered to pay Ms. Collins's full asking price of $229,900. She, in turn, paid Your Home Direct a $6,897 commission, compared with the $13,794 she would have paid a broker charging the standard 6 percent. "Along with the savings," Ms. Collins said, "it was a relatively hassle-free experience."
A recent survey of 20,000 buyers conducted by the National Association of Realtors showed that 37 percent of the home shoppers used the Internet as "as search tool," up from 18 percent in 1997 and from 2 percent in 1995, said Mr. Gronk, the group's president. But he added that 49 percent of the respondents said they actually found their homes through a local Multiple Listing Service, compared with 4 percent who found their homes through the Internet.
"The industry is changing, and Realtors have to prove they add value," Mr. Gronk said. "But today and in the past, sellers have migrated to full-service real estate brokerages." If commissions "are ridiculously low, they ultimately must ask, 'What am I getting and not getting,' " he said.
But Nick Karris, a real estate analyst for Gomez Advisors, an Internet research firm in Lincoln, Mass., said that e-brokerage companies are changing the way business is done.
"These are not fly-by-night companies that just put up fancy Web sites," he said. The consumer "is no longer at the mercy" of the traditional real estate agent or of the traditional 6 percent sales commission.
Executives at many established real estate firms in New Jersey acknowledged that by challenging the conventional pricing of brokerage services, e-brokerage companies like Your Home Direct would appeal to some but certainly not all consumers.
"There are certain things that can't be done unless Realtors rub elbows with buyers and sellers in the field," said Jack Waters, a regional vice president, in the Matawan office, of Weichert Realtors, one of the state's largest residential brokerage companies. "That's where the business is done, not on a laptop."
For his part, Mr. Cohen said that Your Home Direct would not overtake traditional full-service real estate companies. "But we will take a piece of the market," he said.

HEADLINE: Port Norris, One Bead on a String of Isolated Coastal Hamlets

BYLINE: By LAURA MANSNERUS

DATELINE: PORT NORRIS

 BODY:
JOHN LAWS'S service station, with two pumps, is the last one in town, now that the Mobil station has closed. Mr. Laws, who is 63, can remember when there were seven, and he can remember the two clothing stores, the barber shop, the movie theater, the hardware store, the pool hall and the A&P. And those were just some of the businesses on Main Street.
"You didn't have to leave to do anything," Mr. Laws said as he stood outside Laws & Laws service station and hardware store, the busiest place in town on this hot weekday morning. 
 Now, you have to leave Port Norris to do practically everything. There is just Laws & Laws and Newcomb's grocery across the street, and a small pizzeria. There is no pharmacy, no laundry, no library, no liquor store, no diner. The two doctors in town just gave notice that they will be moving to Millville, 12 miles away.
From its docks on the Maurice River, this settlement in Commercial Township used to send Delaware Bay oysters north by the boxcar. But since a blight devastated the beds in the 1950's, Port Norris has been emptying. An industry that once had 4,500 workers has fewer than 200 today, and nothing has come to take its place.
And now Port Norris, with 1,000 to 1,500 residents, is just the biggest bead on a string of tidewater hamlets -- Dividing Creek, Turkey Point Corner, Cedarville -- on the edge of the vast bayside marsh, their clapboard buildings peeling, their commercial centers an occasional grocery with a wooden floor and their residents separated by miles of lowland farms from any sign of New Jersey's labor-hungry suburbs.
Unemployment rates are not broken down by municipality, but the Commercial Township mayor, George Garrison, said joblessness here was "in the double digits, and I'm sure of that much."
Commercial Township is not the poorest municipality in Cumberland County -- average incomes in Bridgeton and Fairfield and Maurice River Townships are lower -- but it cannot support itself.
The township's chief financial officer, Judson Moore, said the biggest tax-paying industry was sand mining, which provided few jobs. The biggest employer, Mr. Moore said, is the school district, with 70 to 80 employees.
Otherwise, the jobs are in Millville and Vineland, at least 20 minutes away. The nearest supermarket is in Millville, too.
Port Norris's ambitions now center on its future as a site for development as part of a federal empowerment zone for distressed areas. The designation brings many forms of aid, which local officials want to use for a wastewater treatment plant, among other things, needed to draw business back to the waterfront.
They also want to bring tourists to the waterfront, consisting of the fishing villages of Shellpile and Bivalve, with its marinas and its unspoiled view across the river's mouth.
But sometimes development presents a bind, too. "If we ever get a water and sewer treatment plant down here, people have to start paying fees," Mr. Moore said. "But there are a lot of poor people in this town. I've talked to senior citizens who have an income of $7,600 for the whole year."
Nor are people clamoring for strip malls and entertainment parks, although Port Norris could use bus service -- to Millville, or anywhere.
"This is a pretty isolated corner of New Jersey," said Stephen Kehs, the director of economic development for Cumberland County. "Most of the people I've spoken to in these little bayshore towns and villages like it that way."
Isolation has its advantages for Port Norris. "There's not a lot to spend dollars on," Mr. Moore said. "But we're hoping people rediscover it."

HEADLINE: To Sprawl, or Not to Sprawl

BYLINE: By LAURA MANSNERUS

DATELINE: MILLVILLE

 BODY:
SOME things down here refuse to change. In the 1980's, anticipating the completion of Route 55, speculators from the north bought 38 acres next to Roger Ruske's farm here, paying $2,800 an acre. The highway arrived, but not much else. Last year, Mr. Ruske bought the property -- for $1,100 an acre.
If sprawl is New Jersey's most persistent blight, then the south of South Jersey is its last unscarred territory. Largely beyond the reach -- or consciousness -- of Philadelphia, and in no way commutable from New York or North Jersey, Cumberland and Salem Counties have a life apart from the rest of the state. 
 These two counties contain 2.5 percent of New Jersey's population of eight million and about a quarter of its agricultural production, which was $800 million in 1998. Between them they have three movie theaters, a dozen farm equipment dealers and not one Starbucks.
The biggest private school is the Cumberland Christian School. Roadside churches have lawns full of cars on Sunday morning. Some families sell garden produce by setting it on a card table in the front yard and leaving a coffee can for payments.
Most people want these things to stay this way. But everybody wants some other things to change:
Both counties have fewer jobs than they did 10 years ago. Per-capita income is barely two-thirds of the statewide figure of $31,265 -- or about the level of Georgia's.
While 25 percent of all adults in New Jersey are college graduates, the proportion in Salem and Cumberland is 10 to 12 percent.
In the big city, the old manufacturing and farm-market center of Vineland, the main street is strung with nail salons and dollar stores. In the smaller cities -- Bridgeton, Salem, Penns Grove -- many buildings wear plywood and for-rent signs.
The south seems to illustrate a principle of economic development: to be unspoiled is to be left behind. James W. Hughes, the dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy, said: "It's a classic rural dilemma. What type of growth do you want?"
Once, the growth was industrial. And to be sure, some industry is contemporary and prospering, especially in a band along the Delaware River from the DuPont laboratories in northern Salem County to the three nuclear power plants clustered in the south. But the glass industry has withered, and the canneries and textile factories are largely abandoned.
In the last decade, not much has changed, including the population. From 1990 to 1998, according to census estimates, Salem County lost a few hundred residents, slipping to 64,912 from 65,294, and Cumberland County had gained a few thousand, to 140,341 from 138,053.
People down here -- and they call it "down here" -- are always weighing the tradeoffs they make. As the glass and canning industries departed, the south welcomed prisons (Cumberland County has four) and nuclear plants and sent residents to casino jobs an hour or more away. The towns along the Delaware Bay are peaceful, untrammeled by urbanites in search of vacation homes -- and they are disturbingly poor. Agriculture is healthy, but as a tax base farms cannot compare with office buildings.
In his office at Cumberland Nurseries, Mr. Ruske, for one, readily allowed that "Cumberland County is the poorest county in the state; we're on the top of all the bad lists and at the bottom of all the good lists."
But he added: "We are the richer part of the state, if you consider the quality of life. Do you want open spaces or million-dollar houses that you have in Monmouth County? We're left out, but I still think that's good."
In Shiloh, about three miles west of Bridgeton, where a few weathered stores cluster around a single blinking traffic light, Frank Noyes considered the problem from the counter of his auto repair shop, a business his father started in 1942. "This area is probably as depressed as any area around, but it's a great place to live," Mr. Noyes said. "I don't think in New Jersey you could find a better place."
In Fortescue, Shirley Fonash said the visitors to the tiny village on Delaware Bay and to her waterfront restaurant, the Charlesworth, came because "they've heard we're a step back in time."
But her daughter, Cindy Fay, a computer programmer who lives in Vineland and waits tables on weekends, said she could stand to see Cumberland County's quaintness compromised by some four-lane highways. "Why should we have to drive an hour, be it to Cherry Hill or Wilmington, to get a decent-paying technical position?" Mrs. Fay asked. "We are not just tomato pickers."
Indeed, if it seems that a local economy cannot thrive without an outbreak of office parks and mini-mansions, planners and economists say that is probably the case. The gap between north and south has been a fact for decades, if not centuries. But in the last 30 years, at least in terms of income, it has grown: In 1969, per-capita income was 28 percent higher in the five northeastern counties than in Salem and Cumberland; in 1997 it was 47 percent higher.
Mr. Hughes of Rutgers said the disparity would most likely grow as the inner cities and truly rural areas were left farther behind. In the south, below what he calls "the commutershed" of Philadelphia, Mr. Hughes said, "You're not going to get office development, and for manufacturing you don't have the highly skilled labor force you need."
Thomas Hamer, a professor of economics at Rowan University in Glassboro, said that "at the risk of being one in favor of sprawl, to get development we've got to extend the sprawl into those two counties.
"The only way to do that is pave a freeway," Professor Hamer said. "Until that happens, they'll continue to be remote because of the transportation time and cost."
There are many people, especially in Salem County, who say they would rather be remote.
John A. Kugler, a Salem County freeholder, said that when local officials convened four years ago to redraw the county's master plan, they intended to deflect development to I-295 and the turnpike and the nearby industrial band on the Delaware River -- and for the rest of the county to be left alone.
On a drive through Aldine, just above the Cumberland County line, Mr. Kugler paused where the cows take their 250-yard daily walk down the main thoroughfare to the milking barns.
Proceeding north into Gloucester County, he nodded toward a giant clot of town houses and scattered subdivisions looking raw on the treeless terrain.
"This is what we're trying to avoid," he said. "It's choking the school system."
And while Salem County has helped finance an industrial park and an office complex on I-295 that will employ thousands of workers, "we don't want them to live here," Mr. Kugler said. "We want them to come in from someplace in Pennsylvania."
So far, Salem County has had its wish: last year, a total of 144 new housing units were authorized by building permits. (Cumberland had 370; by contrast, Gloucester had 1,539, Burlington 2,933 and Ocean 4,155.)
"The county is a real throwback," said Patricia DiMatteo Knobloch, the director of economic development. "It hasn't stopped in time, but it's been able to preserve the best of what was in New Jersey. It's one of the few places where you can write a check without having to show the history of your life."
This is hardly a preserve of gentleman farmers. The county ranks 18th of the state's 21 in per-capita income, down from 13th 30 years ago. Prices for the main crops, soybeans and corn, have plunged. The city of Salem is poorer than Trenton or Asbury Park.
Still, Salem County's unemployment rate is a respectable 3.8 percent, and it ranks near the top in average wage for nonfarm workers, thanks to high-paying jobs in the nuclear power plants on the river and in chemical manufacturing and research.
"We don't have to be pro-development," Ms. Knobloch said. She added that the area's farmers, many from families who settled here 200 or 300 years ago, were unusually reluctant to sell; it took her 11 years to persuade one to part with a parcel for an industrial park at an interchange.
If Ms. Knobloch is gingerly trying to find places for development, her counterpart in Cumberland County, Stephen Kehs, is simply trying to find development. "We've got plenty of land around Millville and Vineland and Bridgeton," Mr. Kehs said. "We have to be looking for new jobs. We've still got an unemployment rate of 7.2 percent."
That rate is a big improvement from the bleak 1980's, when unemployment approached 20 percent, but it is still by far the highest in New Jersey.
The economic recovery in the 1990's saw more and more Cumberland County residents go to work in the four prisons, which now employ about 5,000 people, or one in 12 workers, and casinos in Atlantic City, employing about 2,000.
Cumberland is celebrating its recent designation as a federal empowerment zone, giving the county millions of dollars in aid and enabling it to offer tax credits and other incentives to businesses. "For better or worse," Mr. Kehs said, the county was eligible because the poverty rate exceeded 20 percent in parts of Vineland and Bridgeton.
"Everybody leaves," said Shirley Spencer of Vineland, on a stroll with her husband, Cleo, at the Cumberland County Fair. Mrs. Spencer said of their six children, all of whom went to college, "They couldn't stay in Vineland because there's nothing for them."
"One of my daughters graduated from law school, and for all the places she looked for work here, she couldn't find anything."
Mrs. Spencer said she suspected something more than economic stagnation -- "in my opinion it was because she was black and she was a woman" -- but she also doubted that Vineland would ever recover.
"When the plants were open, everybody was working," said Mrs. Spencer, who retired as a cook in the public schools. "Now, there are so many people without jobs and no transportation to get people to where they are."
Many of those who manage to stay have been buffeted.
"If you want a good job, you've got to travel an hour, an hour and a half," said Ira Morris, a boat builder at Silverton Marine Corporation in Millville. For a while, Mr. Morris had to commute to Atlantic County for a job, almost two hours each way.
Sean Tomlin is trying to stay here, too, starting his own Web-design business, Loaded Media, in a commercial building on High Street in downtown Millville. At 24, Mr. Tomlin has already ridden the employment seesaw in his hometown, which is always seeing jobs come and go.
His employer, until it laid off most of its staff last winter, was Camanco Communications, an ambitious start-up that provided Internet access to computers in hotel rooms. Mr. Tomlin said about 250 people lost their jobs, including many people who had relocated from as far away as Nebraska and California.
"It was great," Mr. Tomlin said as he took a break on a July afternoon when High Street was looking tidy but ghostly. "Stock options, competitive pay. There were some very talented people working there. That's what I miss the most."
Mr. Kehs hopes the county can draw some more information-technology employers, but he also wants ware housing, food processing and other industries that can absorb what he calls the "hard-to-reach remnant" of the work force stranded when the glass and textile factories closed.
And in that market, the competition is not New York or Bergen County but the south. "We're beginning to market our part of the state as an alternative to the Carolinas," Mr. Kehs said. "We have the same kinds of affordable land, labor and economic opportunities."
Mr. Kehs can also advertise one advantage unknown in the rest of New Jersey: affordable housing. Last year, the National Association of Home Builders named the Vineland-Millville-Bridgeton area the nation's 11th most affordable market, a measure comparing home prices and median income.
And while local governments chase ratables, the lag in development is good for agriculture, still crucial to the economy here. Wesley Kline, an agricultural agent for Cumberland County, said that "if agriculture is going to survive in New Jersey, it's going to survive here in Cumberland County."
Mr. Ruske, the nursery owner, agrees, even while he says the state's farmland preservation program is of little use to local growers because their development rights command so little. "I've heard for the 35 years I've lived here that things are going to get better, and it hasn't," he said. "Yet agriculture has gotten better."
"We don't have the impediment of housing," he said, "and agriculture is important to the right people -- the freeholders, the planning boards." At the same time, he said, the growers here have become some of the most proficient and productive in the country.
Mr. Ruske, who just stepped down as president of the state board of agriculture, is a third-generation nurseryman, having moved from Connecticut in 1967 in search of land that someone just out of college could afford. His is a family farm, in that his 31-year-old son, Chris, plans to take it over, but Mr. Ruske is impatient with the sentimental image of farm life.
"Most people's picture of the family farm is 'American Gothic,' " he said. "It's subsistence farming. That's absolute nonsense."
His own sector of the agricultural economy is burgeoning along with the suburbs from Maine to Virginia; on his 275 acres are yews, holly and viburnum for the fresh landscapes of office parks and subdivisions. "It's the right industry with the right product at the right time," he said, "which is why we make money."
The farm lobby points out at every opportunity that New Jersey's farmland is the most expensive and highly taxed in the nation, and that dairy and grain farmers are under siege here, as everywhere. But the old-fashioned South Jersey family truck farm is getting along.
"I bought my farm as a farm, and this is how I want to make a living," said Andrew Buzby, who grows fruit and vegetables in Salem County. He has 13 laborers this summer, but also relies on his wife, his three sons and his 73-year-old father.
"It's a real good way to make a living if you can do it," Mr. Buzby said.
There's another promising industry here -- or at least one without a downside -- and that is marketing the beauty here in the southern part of the state. Mr. Kehs said, for example, that in the fishing and birding season there were more than 100,000 vehicle trips just to the tiny bay village of Fortescue.
Mrs. Fonash, at the Charlesworth Restaurant and Hotel, has seen many of the visitors, fishers on the boats and birders in the reeds, who make the 10-minute drive from the nearest through road.
A jumble of cottages and mobile homes with about 300 year-round residents, Fortescue is decidedly unpolished. But that's why people like it, Ms. Fonash said: "People are looking for the hidden away, less exploited places. And we are hidden away."
Fortescue was not always so undiscovered. The Charlesworth, built in 1924, once looked out on a beach and a boardwalk, which led to a pavilion for dancing for summer crowds. But storms obliterated beach, boardwalk and tourism, and the Charlesworth, which had been the height of elegance, closed nine years ago.
When she and her husband, Jim, bought the business two years later and reopened it, "some kind of higher power was directing us, or else it was a total stroke of idiocy," Mrs. Fonash said. But now their dining room, an everybody-knows-everybody kind of place with a table of Europeans or New Yorkers here and there, is usually full, and their five guest rooms usually booked.
"We haven't made a nickel on it, to tell the truth," Mrs. Fonash said while the accordion player set up and the kitchen clanged on a recent Friday night. "But we've come so far in seven years."
Her daughter, Mrs. Fay, paused on her way to the kitchen to continue a conversation. "And I want a four-year college that's less than a 45-minute commute," she said.
Then Mrs. Fonash continued, too, remarking on the boats that dot the bay on summer weekends. "It looks like somebody threw out confetti," she said. "We'd love to expand because the potential is here. It's here. Last year I wouldn't have said that, but this year I know."

HEADLINE: On 14th Street, Less Grit, More Glamour

BYLINE: By NADINE BROZAN

 BODY:
IN a city where the names of some neighborhoods bestow cachet and some addresses are dropped like royal titles, 14th Street has probably never achieved even a minor peerage.
Never mind, says Gary Gaines, an importer who is about to trade in an apartment off Sutton Place for a loft in the Greenwich, a cavernous former department store at 14th Street and the Avenue of the Americas. He has bought 2,150 square feet of finished but unpartitioned space on the third floor. 
 Mr. Gaines's neighbors at the Greenwich will include other migrants from uptown, among them Brian Brooks, who sold his apartment at the venerable Beresford on Central Park West, and Joel Solomon, who lives on the Upper East Side at 80th Street and Third Avenue. Mr. Solomon bought a loft for his 25-year-old son, Stephen, and a penthouse for himself.
"I will miss the seclusion and seeing Bobby Short in my elevator," Mr. Gaines said, "but I like living in the new, being part of something happening. Fourteenth Street is on the threshold of a major transformation, and this building is at its center."
People already living on or near 14th Street would probably say that it has already crossed that threshold, starting with the city's $3.6 million reconstruction of Union Square Park in 1983 and the 1987 opening of the Zeckendorf Towers, a 652-apartment condominium and office complex.
But subsequent and future projects give weight to Mr. Gaines's notion that another threshold has been reached.
The signs of change are noticeable from the western end of the street at least as far east as First Avenue, where Stuyvesant Town dominates the landscape. (Even there, new fencing and ornamental gate posts are planned, and new trees are to be planted.)
These changes are giving 14th Street a new persona as a residential boulevard, a booming retail thoroughfare and a mecca for high-tech enterprises.
At the western side, near 10th Avenue, art galleries, trendy restaurants, late-night clubs and one of the city's highest-fashion emporiums are bringing elegance and verve to the gritty meatpacking district.
From Eighth to Fifth Avenues, new technology and dot.com companies are clamoring for space, joining the publishers, photographers, graphic designers and advertising agencies already encamped there. An eyesore was removed recently when the long-empty 14th Street Armory was torn down earlier this year to make way for two new apartment towers and a Y.M.C.A.
On the east side of the street, further improvements are planned for Union Square Park. The city has earmarked $2.5 million to expand the park by 20,000 square feet at its southwest corner between 14th and 15th Streets.
East of the park, New York University is expanding its domain, constructing a 16-story dormitory on the site of the old Palladium nightclub. The new building is two doors away from a 19-story N.Y.U. dorm completed two years ago. The university has also signed a lease for a 14-story building being put up by Alex Forkosh, a developer, on the site of former Sahara Hotel, once a notorious single-room-occupancy hotel and drug haven at 14th Street and Third Avenue.
David Gmach, the executive director of both the 14th Street-Union Square Business Improvement District and the 14th Street-Union Square Local Development Corporation, considers the conversion of the Sahara and the demolition of the 14th Street Armory, both of which were symptomatic of decay, to be hallmarks of the changes that have swept across the entire street.
Where the armory stood between the Avenue of the Americas and Seventh Avenue, two residential towers will be developed by the Orda Management Corporation and the Related Companies. One will contain 60 luxury condominiums for N.Y.U. faculty members; the other will be a rental with 225 units, 20 percent of which will be reserved for low-income tenants. The McBurney Y.M.C.A. will occupy two floors at the base of the building.
"I would be surprised if you could find another single street with that much going on in a two-to-three-year period," Mr. Gmach said during a recent walk from 10th Avenue to Avenue B. "There is at least one million square feet of development that has either been recently completed or is under way."
As much as any artery in the city, 14th Street, which is the dividing line between Chelsea and Greenwich Village and also borders the Flatiron district and the Ladies Mile Historic District, has flourished and withered and then flourished again.
A century ago, it was the cultural and political epicenter of the city: the Academy of Music, vaudeville theaters and Tammany Hall were all thriving. Before the rise of Fifth Avenue as a commercial hub, 14th Street was a retail center, housing the early quarters of Macy's, Tiffany's and Best & Company. When those stores moved uptown, bargain emporiums like S. Klein and J. W. Mays set the tone for the area.
Then about 35 years ago, the area began to slide into deterioration, its middle-class shops shuttered or replaced by cut-rate stores with flashy merchandise displayed on the sidewalk. Union Square became a magnet for drug dealers and derelicts.
"Mays went out, the recession came in, and so did the junkies," said Alex Barbagianis, an owner of Ariston Florist, which moved to 14th Street and Fifth Avenue nine years ago after 16 years in a location a block to the west. "You could buy any kind of dope here, and we had a tough time."
Then, several significant changes took place, and a turnaround seemed possible. The Union Square Greenmarket was established in 1976, the city refurbished the park, and Zeckendorf Towers opened on the site of the former S. Klein store at Union Square East.
As Chelsea became gentrified, lower Fifth Avenue acquired national retailers and chic shops, and stores like Bed Bath & Beyond and Barnes & Noble moved to the southern end of the Avenue of the Americas, it became all but inevitable that 14th Street would be upgraded.
"If Times Square is the crossroads of the world, then 14th Street is the crossroads of New York, because it's where uptown and downtown come together as a 24-hour community where people both live and work," said Mr. Gmach, the BID executive. "Everything New Yorkers could want is at their fingertips. There is a blend of activities and diversity here."
Although that assessment is widely shared, many would also agree that 14th Street is a work in progress, and more remains to be done to elevate it to first-class status. Some developers of residential property, for example, still insist on giving their buildings addresses on 13th or 15th Streets. Mosbacher Properties, the developer of the Greenwich, for example, plans to put the entrance on 13th Street.
"Fourteenth Street is one of the last major crosstown streets in the city to undergo improvement," said David Schore, the president of Mark Holdings, which recently bought the building at 25 West 14th Street. "Fifty-Seventh Street was always great, and 42nd and 34th now have a lot of new retailers."
If he were to measure, he said, "Forty-Second Street is 90 percent done, 34th is 50 percent done, and 14th is 50 percent done. There are still a lot of 99-cent and electronics stores, and those will be squeezed out by higher rents and hopefully higher-rent retailers. It will never be an upper Madison Avenue, but it could be a healthy extension of lower Fifth Avenue with a lot of national chains."
MR. SCHORE is in the process of turning his building into a combination retail and office space with a total of 70,000 square feet. "Even before I closed, and it was public that I was the buyer, I was getting constant calls from brokers," he said. "I have seen both new and traditional office users come in."
Lucille Strider, a broker who moved to 14th Street 11 years ago, contends that the street has already arrived. "I do retail and apartment rentals and apartment sales, and this area is hot as a pistol," she said. "Prices just keep going up. There is no cap. There seems to be constant need, and some days are like a feeding frenzy."
"Two years ago we were lucky to get $30 a square foot for retail space," she said. "Now it is between $75 and $100."
Ms. Strider has had a front-row seat for the evolution of her neighborhood. "I moved into a building between Fifth and University Place in 1989 that had a large OTB parlor downstairs," she said. "At 6 p.m. everything closed and shuttered, and it was like living in the Third World."
About seven years ago, OTB moved out and its premises were divided in half, with Radio Shack taking part of it and the rest remaining vacant. Now a day spa will move into the other half. The Garden of Eden, a specialty food shop that offers everything from charcuterie to caviar, has also recently moved into the building.
Andrew Rasiej, the chief executive and president of the Digital Club Network, an Internet company that cybercasts live concerts, in many ways typifies the kind of businessman who would not consider the more traditional Wall Street or Midtown areas for his office.
The founder of Irving Plaza, the music club on nearby Irving Place, he is negotiating a lease for a two-story former furniture store between Fifth Avenue and the Avenue of the Americas.
"I am in a Silicon Alley business, and it is important for my company and my employees to feel that they are in the middle of a network of Silicon Alley," he said. "There is no better place to feel like you're in the middle of the New York technology community than 14th Street because of its proximity to the Flatiron district and easy access to transportation."
Like many of his peers, Mr. Rasiej said lifestyle considerations were as important a part of his decision as the quality of the working space.
He noted that his 60 employees, soon to be expanded to 75, range in age from 22 to 35. "Most people in dot.coms work 10- to 12-hour days," he said. "For them to have any personal time, they need to be near home and near their social life. Nobody wants to commute an hour to get home or to a party. Being in the center, you have restaurants, bars, clubs, theaters, and good transportation is a recruiting asset." Fourteen subway lines and 14 bus routes converge on 14th Street, and so does the PATH line.
While there remain plenty of small and medium-sized buildings in the area, it is large complexes that have more dramatically changed its flavor.
Probably the most visible example is the Related Companies' building at 1 Union Square South. Situated between Broadway and Fourth Avenue across from Union Square Park and made distinctive by its giant steam-puffing sculpture, the building houses 240 apartments, a Virgin Megastore, a Circuit City Superstore and a 14-screen movie theater.
"That development with its mix of retail and residential has been a cornerstone of the revitalization of the area," said Mr. Gmach, the BID executive.
Another landmark on Union Square but one whose future seems unsure is the former Mays store, now occupied by a Bradlees. The Bradlees discount chain, which has declared bankruptcy, sold its lease back to the landlord, Vornado Realty, but obtained an agreement allowing it to remain in the building until March 2002. Wendi Kopsick, a spokeswoman for Vornado, would not comment on plans beyond that date.
But 14th Street is not only a commercial thoroughfare. With 100,000 students enrolled at N.Y.U., the New School University, Pratt Institute, Baruch College, Cooper Union and Cardozo Law School, all near 14th Street, it is an academic hub. "That's bigger than Ohio State and Notre Dame combined," said Jeffrey Roseman, the executive vice president of Newmark New Spectrum Retail, which is leasing and marketing several projects in the area.
Two years ago, N.Y.U. put up a $55 million dormitory on the old Luchow's site between Third and Fourth Avenues, to accommodate 600 students, and now it is building another dormitory for 1,000 students two doors away. This dorm, on the site of the former Palladium, will cost $120 million. The dorms flank P. C. Richards, one of the first chain stores to venture as far east as Third Avenue. At the back of the buildings, the Genesis Robert F. Kennedy Apartments, a complex of 94 apartments on 13th Street for formerly homeless and low-income people, offers on-site social services. "This shows the neighborhood will continue to have a diverse population," Mr. Gmach said.
LYNNE P. BROWN, the associate vice president for government and community relations at N.Y.U., said: "Twenty years ago with the problems in Union Square Park that drove everything else out, we wouldn't have considered putting students there. Now we are happy to be part of the mix not only out of self-interest, which means finding a congenial area for students, but we also like to think we're helping to move it one more step to its renaissance."
Pratt Institute has bought seven stories in a converted factory at 142-144 West 14th Street because it has outgrown its space in the Puck Building in SoHo. Administrators and trustees of Pratt, whose main campus is in Brooklyn, spent two years scouring Lower Manhattan for a new site before choosing the one on 14th Street.
"It had about 80,000 square feet, it was in a superb location in regard to transportation, and it is in an area with a number of educational institutions with whom we interact," said Thomas F. Schutte, the president of Pratt. "We felt there was a buzz here, and we are just plain excited about it."
The street is also home to several major medical institutions, including the Beth Israel Medical Center's Phillips Ambulatory Care Center; the Elizabeth Seton Childbearing Center, which is affiliated with St. Vincent's Hospital and Medical Center; and New York Eye and Ear Infirmary.
One stretch that has been spruced up without losing its Old World charm is the tree-lined block between Second and Third Avenues, which has a variety of small shops and restaurants ranging from Jamaican to Filipino to Mexican.
"This block was one of the worst blocks and one of the last to change," said Daphne Mahoney, the owner of Daphne's Caribbean Express, known for its Jamaican meat patties. "There are more people working in the block, more security guards and more sanitation. And it is great to see N.Y.U. moving in here. I cater their students' end-of-exam parties."
John F. Mazzola opened a restaurant that bears his nickname, Johnny Mozzarella, four months ago. "I saw this was an up-and-coming area, but they needed a little Italian flair," he said.
Sprinkled from one end of the street to the other is a growing residential population, ranging from artists, who populated lofts in meatpacking buildings for years, to families and elderly people in Stuyvesant Town, whose southern border is 14th Street. In between are the renters and buyers in larger, sometimes more luxurious buildings.
Though it is residential conversions like the one in the stately landmark Bank Building at Eighth Avenue and 14th Street that are getting most of the attention, "not every development is a luxury condo," Mr. Gmach said, "and we now have buildings available that have never before been utilized as residential buildings."
In some of those, rents remain reasonable, but more often than not, they are escalating. For example, Charles Blaichman, a developer and builder, bought three rather nondescript mixed-use buildings at 18 and 20 East 14th Street and at 60 West 14th in a package deal for $7 million three years ago. He has turned the two buildings on East 14th into 62 apartments, ranging in size from 500-square-foot studios to 900-square-foot two-bedroom units for which he is charging $1,750 to $5,000 a month. He is now converting the West 14th building, which will have 65 apartments at comparable rents.
"I saw a real shortage of rental apartments downtown, so I never thought of selling condos or lofts," he said. "We rented very quickly, and we think there is still a big demand. They are well located, and things will only get better."
Whatever prosperity is to be found in the rental market is more than matched in the sales arena.
At the Greenwich, the former store at 14th Street and the Avenue of the Americas, where finished but unpartitioned lofts ranging in size from 766 square feet to 3,100 square feet are under construction, contracts have been signed for 69 of the 79 units. Prices range from $465,000 for the one studio in the building to $3.425 million for a penthouse with a giant terrace.
The average price per square foot is $692, and buyers have the option to configure rooms with their own architects or, for additional fees, to leave that to the building's designers, Franke Gottsegen Cox Architects in Manhattan. Many buyers have purchased more than one loft, including one who bought the entire seventh floor, said Michele Conte of Brown Harris Stevens, the building's director of sales.
Ms. Conte described her job as "having to guess what will sell two to three years ahead." "We have known for several years that a lot of uptown people would be moving downtown," she added.
Asked why buyers were willing to give up park or river vistas for views of the traffic on 14th Street, she said, "It is the lifestyle, the vibrancy of the street, the youthfulness, the creative electricity in the air," she added.
"The people who are buying are, by and large, new money, but they are people with a very down-to-earth attitude," she said. "They don't wear three-piece suits but jeans to work, and 80 percent of them are between 30 and 35 years old. This is smart money. It is not out to flash."
Indeed, Mr. Brooks, 44, the chief human resources officer for WPP, the marketing and communications conglomerate, who has lived in the Beresford for three years, said: "I am not leaving because of the building but because I concluded that I really want to live downtown. This is mostly about my perception that the old East Side-West Side divide in New York in terms of defining neighborhood characteristics is disappearing and is being replaced by an uptown-downtown dichotomy.
Mr. Solomon, who owns a moving and storage company, bought an apartment in the Greenwich for his son in October. Happily ensconced at Third Avenue and 80th Street after moving to the city from Great Neck, N.Y., he had no thought of uprooting himself again.
T HEN I began to think it's time to move," he said. "The East Side is very homogenous. If you've eaten in one Italian restaurant, you've eaten in them all."
Now he and his wife, Suzette, will move into a 2,661-square-foot penthouse loft at the Greenwich with a 2,057-square-foot terrace. "In our previous apartment I felt that though we lived in the city, we hadn't really moved in," he said.
Still, not everyone with ties to 14th Street views its evolution with unmitigated glee. Marcia Garcia-Starkey, a co-chairwoman of the 14th Street Special Committee that represents two community boards, worries that diversity will be engulfed by a tidal wave of chic.
"We don't want to turn 14th Street into an urban mall," she said, citing the loss of Dizzy Izzy's, a bagel store across the street from Markt, the Belgian bistro of the moment. "He was there for at least 20 years, but he couldn't afford the rent when the lease ran out," she said. "Dizzy Izzy's was a place where transgendered people gathered. When neighborhoods become upscale like Chelsea has, diversity goes out the window."
"At the corner of Seventh Avenue, there is a Cuban restaurant where you can get rice and beans, chicken or pork for $5," she continued. "Those are the kind of things that could disappear, and we don't want to see a 'white bread' 14th Street."

HEADLINE: Responding to Responses On 'What Would You Do?'

 BODY:

To the Editor:
The answers last Sunday to Peter Applebome's request for responses to his July 23 column about his decision not to confront a black man about loud rap music with X-rated lyrics he was playing in the presence of Mr. Applebome's young daughter revealed much about the respondents. Nowhere in evidence was there concern for the daughter in permitting her to be exposed to such vulgarity -- or to the display of cowardice and ignobility implicit in failing to oppose it -- or, for that matter, for all the other little daughters who will, likewise, eventually be exposed by the failure to act now.
The reasoning behind most of the respondents was the same ethic-less selfishness displayed by Mr. Applebome. "We have to put up with more and more thoughtlessness from others and really can't fight back," says Marian Parker. The thought of righteous opposition to indecency evidently never crosses her mind. "Why risk an altercation with someone you'll never see again?" asks Gene Busnar. Someone will see that man again; are their rights not to occupy some portion of your philosophy? "There is just too much rage floating around in society to make it worth any risk of your well-being, or even your life," observes Phyllis Lutzker. What kind of "life" is it to perpetually ignore evidences of inhumanity? 
 The responses that did not depict overweaning absorption with one's own survival alone displayed a penchant for embracing the insipid and meaningless. Austin J. Maher describes his wife as "lightheartedly" offering that she "really likes the beat of the music, but doesn't know about the lyrics." Truthfulness about her opinion of the music apparently takes a back seat to simply defusing the incident. D. Grace Challoner states that she resorts, simply, to rolling up the window and having a sing-along with her child -- inculcating the notion that evil is not to be countered, only run away from, leaving others to face it. Terrence Ripmaster offers only the observation that the makers of the rap music "generate billions of dollars into our economy."
The respondents all come from high-priced enclaves of the sort Mr. Applebome inhabits. Mr. Applebome speaks of "a sense of suburban politesse that trumps everything else." Such "politesse" appears to be to sacrificing ethics and principle just to cut someone not from the suburbs some slack. One detects feeling that, having skewered the public in so many other ways, the least the snotty rich can do is to allow those they see as their beasts of burden to act like the animals they perceive them to be, once in a while.
Mr. Applebome does, after all, conjure the image of a "working-class white kid" playing the rap music in a car next to him. Evidently, Mr. Applebome divorces himself from the working world. With the remuneration he is provided through the thought control articles he seems to perennially submit to the media, he seems in no hurry to consider himself part of the same masses he seeks to pattern the morality and manners of.
We all are responsible for making the civilization better, and the only way it can get better is if we do not just sit back and let the world overtake us. You have to be a participant in the world.

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW;
U.S. Remains Destination Of Choice For Investors

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE United States has been living through extraordinary economic times for so long now that fresh milestones sometimes pass with a yawn. With growth rates over 5 percent, subdued inflation, low unemployment, high productivity and strong corporate profits -- all with the expansion already a decade old -- it is hard to surprise people with good news.
But here is another sweet nugget to chew on: The unusually large gap between the performance of the United States economy of those of its main peers, Europe and Japan, is proving more sustainable than many economists expected. And the strong dollar that helped make it all possible continues to defy gravity. 
 Months after the sharp correction in the Nasdaq began last April, the dollar has not only failed to plunge against the yen and the euro as was once widely expected, but it has actually retouched its record highs against the euro and held steady against the yen.
Indeed, stock market nervousness aside, foreigners have arguably never had as much faith in the future of the American economy as they do today. The dollar's value is determined, in the simplest sense, by the confidence that the world has in the United States. And nothing that is happening here has persuaded foreigners that they would do better to put their money elsewhere.
The old economic laws suggest that this cannot go on indefinitely. In a sense, the United States has been living on borrowed money, running the largest trade and current account deficits in its history. That makes it more vulnerable to the whims of foreign trading partners. Fortunately, they seem to be as smitten by America's technology revolution as Americans are.
"They are not flinching," said Edward Yardeni, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities in New York. "In terms of the new economy, Europe is still somewhat behind and Japan is seriously behind, and they cannot afford not to be here."
Perhaps the most popular script for a so-called hard landing of the American economy begins with a stock market correction, followed by a plunge in the supercharged dollar, reflecting the world's lowered hopes for growth and profits here.
If this country's major trading peers -- Europe, Japan, Canada and Mexico -- stopped recycling the dollars they earn by selling goods here into productive investments here, the dollar would quickly lose its strength. That would make imports more expensive, contribute to inflation, cause the Fed to raise interest rates and further undermine the stock market.
Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers has been sufficiently concerned about such an outcome for the past year that he traveled the globe urging the country's economic peers to prod their economies to grow faster so that the world could "balance up," not "balance down." Europe has been growing only half as fast as the United States, and Japan's economy is flat, worsening the already severe American trade deficit.
A HARD landing could still happen if the stock market takes another dive. But the 30 percent correction in the Nasdaq was no minor blip, and it only slightly unnerved dollar investors, who have since sent the United States currency higher.
Exactly why is speculative. But the consensus is that foreign investors view America's technology prowess as far more resilient than a stock market bubble. And they are willing to keep investing in what is essentially a seller's market -- the high dollar making assets here very expensive.
One way that shows up is through mergers and acquisitions of American companies by foreigners, which have quickened this year from the already extraordinary rate of 1998 and 1999. Through early August, foreign companies had announced 1,202 deals to buy American companies, with the purchases valued at $266 billion. For all of 1999, there were 1,701 deals valued at $305 billion.
If that enthusiasm continues, it is not inconceivable that the record current account deficit could continue to expand without jeopardizing the dollar and the economy.
Rudi Dornbusch, an economics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, says the United States, with its younger population, has long had lower savings rates and higher investment rates than Europe and Japan. That was true even when Japan seemed to be years ahead in manufacturing efficiency. But it is still true today, when both Japan and Europe lag far behind in technological innovation, he said.
"People who were worried about our deficit were wrong because they underestimated the appeal of our new economy," Mr. Dornbusch said. "It's as though there's both an oil and a gold rush, and it's all happening here."

HEADLINE: WEDDINGS;
Kenya Johnson, Michael Johnson

 BODY:
Kenya Latrell Johnson, a daughter of Josephine and Walter Johnson of Brooklyn, and Michael George Johnson, the son of Nancy and George Johnson of St. Albans, Queens, were married yesterday. The Rev. Richard J. Lawson performed the ceremony at the New Canaan Baptist Church in Brooklyn.
Mrs. Johnson, 29, works in Manhattan as the project manager in marketing for Discovery.com, the Web site for Discovery Communications, a media company. She graduated from Clark Atlanta University in Georgia. Her mother retired as a traffic enforcement agent with the New York Police Department. Her father, also retired, was a porter for the New York City Transit Authority. 
 Mr. Johnson, 27, is a senior planner with the New York City Economic Development Corporation. He graduated from the University of Virginia at Charlottesville. His mother is a real estate sales representative with Greene Team Realty in St. Albans. His father is a custodian with the New York City Board of Education.
The couple met the old-fashioned way: at church, specifically the New Canaan Baptist Church, in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn. They had grown up in that church together but over the years had exchanged no more than a polite "How are you?" They didn't even know each other's names.
In the fall of 1997, the bride, who had been working as a promotions coordinator at various Atlanta television stations, made the church one of her first stops after returning to Brooklyn. She had taken a job at a pay-per-view television service in Manhattan and was re-establishing her social life in New York.
Mr. Johnson was putting away his trumpet after playing for the Sunday morning service when she approached him. He, too, had recently returned to Brooklyn, after receiving a master's degree in city planning from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "I had recognized him from the church," Mrs. Johnson said.
The two commiserated about the task of finding jobs, and he took her business card. He was about to move to Maryland but called her a couple of times just to chat. About a week later, when job prospects in Maryland didn't pan out, he returned to New York and made a date.
By the end of the evening, Mr. Johnson said, he was seeing her "in a different light." She didn't have stars in her eyes yet, but she agreed to get together again.
"I liked his warmth," Mrs. Johnson remembered. "He was easy to be with. He loved his family and was intelligent." By the third or fourth date, he had won her over.
By December 1997, things were serious enough to make both sets of parents check to see if branches of the two family trees were somehow entwined. (They aren't. His roots are in Virginia, hers in North Carolina.) After he proposed last Christmas Eve, the jokes began.
"The whole church refers to us as Johnson & Johnson," the bride said. "They say, 'Here comes Johnson & Johnson -- not the baby powder, but the love crew.' "

HEADLINE: Reviving Hospitals' Health

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "Hospital Chain's Critics Call Recovery Incomplete" (Aug. 6), which looked at the performance of the Tenet Healthcare Corporation:
As the hospital industry has undergone a remarkable transformation caused by Medicare cuts, managed care and new technology, Tenet has managed to build successful hospital networks in major markets that preserve access to local care for millions of patients. The company has accomplished this as many other hospital operators have suffered huge losses, dozens of hospitals have closed and thousands of workers have been laid off. 
 The article contains little of this important context. Much of the article seems drawn from controversy that surrounded Tenet's acquisition of not-for-profit hospitals in Los Angeles, Philadelphia and St. Louis two years ago.
Certainly, there were concerns raised then by community leaders and others unfamiliar with Tenet about how it would operate these facilities and whether it would continue to provide care for the poor. Yet there was little in the article to suggest how those acquisitions have turned out.
In 1998, Queen of Angels-Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center in Los Angeles and St. Louis University Hospital in St. Louis joined Tenet in order to meet the tough economic challenges that threatened their future viability. Today, under Tenet ownership, both are stronger than ever. They have added services and, importantly, they have continued to provide the same level of care to the underserved in their communities. The controversy of two years ago has given way to a general recognition that Tenet has strengthened these important health care facilities that otherwise faced an uncertain future.
Two years ago, Tenet stepped in to rescue a network of venerable hospitals in Philadelphia that was within days of closing down after years of losses. Today, thanks to Tenet and the millions of dollars that it has invested, these local health care assets are very much on the mend. Recently, in fact, former President Gerald R. Ford was treated for a mild stroke at Tenet's Hahnemann University Hospital -- a facility that might not even still be open if Tenet had not saved it.
Tenet has achieved its current financial success by investing in its hospitals, making them efficient, emphasizing quality and service, and meeting the needs of the communities that it serves.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Wall St. and the Politics of the Status Quo

BYLINE: By ALEX BERENSON

 BODY:
WALL STREET'S political views are usually summed up with the simple logic that is a staple of junior high math. If all wealthy people are Republicans, and all bankers and traders are wealthy, then all bankers and traders are. . . .
To be sure, there are plenty of exceptions, most notably Robert E. Rubin, who jumped from running Goldman Sachs to become President Clinton's Treasury secretary and is now chairman of Citigroup's executive committee. But for both personal reasons (cut my taxes) and ideological ones (competition is good, except on investment banking fees), most financial professionals prefer the Republican mantra of smaller government programs, less regulation and, of course, lower taxes. 
 This year would seem to be no exception. The Republican candidate, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, is offering enough treats to warm even Gordon Gekko's heart. Mr. Bush wants to end the estate tax, cut income taxes and give people a chance to invest some of their Social Security taxes in the stock market. Vice President Al Gore, on the other side of the aisle, prefers tough environmental regulations and adding a prescription drug benefit to Medicare, a step that the drug industry opposes.
Yet Wall Street remains strangely tepid about Mr. Bush. What gives?
Just this: The last five years have been the best in the history of the United States capital markets. Since the end of 1994, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has more than tripled, and the value of United States stocks has risen by more than $10 trillion, to $16 trillion. The Street may be too conservative to thank Bill Clinton explicitly for its good fortune, but it is well aware that the federal budget surplus has played an integral role in powering the market higher.
To finance deficits, the government must sell bonds to investors, competing for capital that could otherwise be used to invest in stocks or corporate bonds. Government borrowings raise long-term interest rates, stifling economic growth.
But in the last five years, thanks to tax increases in 1990 and 1993 and relatively restrained government spending, the federal budget has gone from deficit to surplus. As a result, long-term interest rates have fallen from 8 percent to less than 6 percent, after dipping as low as 5 percent in late 1998. With lower interest rates and lots of capital available, companies of all sizes have been able to raise the money they need to grow. In turn, strong economic growth has stimulated consumer spending, raised tax revenue and increased the government's surplus, making even more capital available for private companies.
Sure, the surplus is not the only reason that the economy has performed so well lately. Information technology and the explosion of the Internet have probably been even more important. But investors are not interested in a return to deficit spending.
"Wall Street likes it just as it is and doesn't want to see any big policy changes," said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer of the First Albany Corporation.
But both Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush are eager to get their hands on the surplus for new spending programs and tax cuts. Either move would be a mistake, said Byron Wien, chief United States investment strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. In fact, if the new president is able to spend the surplus, the Federal Reserve will probably raise short-term interest rates, Mr. Wien said. That's because the Fed is already worried that the United States economy is growing too fast and increasing the risk of inflation, and that deficits (or lower surpluses) will further stimulate the economy in the short run.
"I don't want either party's program to pass," Mr. Wien said.
Mr. Johnson agreed. While the Street has a slight preference for Mr. Bush, it would be happiest if neither party controls both the White House and Congress next year, he said. "I'd like to see a Republican president neutralized by a Democratic Congress," he said. "Give us policy gridlock."

HEADLINE: OFF THE SHELF;
Speaking of Success, In a Woman's Voice

BYLINE: By ALECIA SWASY; Alecia Swasy, assistant managing editor for business at The St. Petersburg Times, is the author of "Soap Opera: The Inside Story of Procter & Gamble."

 BODY:
INSIDE our newsroom in St. Petersburg, Fla., is a filing-cabinet drawer emblazoned with a yellow smiley face. We call it the Happy Drawer -- home to the good stuff.
No, it's not where we keep the Belvedere vodka. We're talking chocolate. Hershey's Kisses, Snickers bars and Reese's peanut butter cups. 
 When the chocolate stash runs low, people get cranky. No small problem, considering that there is a correlation between chocolate served and articles produced. The average 1,000-word article might require a handful of Kisses, while a 300-page nonfiction book might mean 27 1/2 pounds of peanut M & M's.
So what a treat to come across the management tricks of fellow chocolate aficionado Ellen Gordon, the chief executive of Tootsie Roll Industries. At 68, Mrs. Gordon presides over production of 49.5 million Tootsie Rolls and 16 million lollipops a day, generating a net profit margin of 17 percent, far ahead of her competitors at Hershey. She merits a place among the profiles of "Why the Best Man for the Job Is a Woman" (Harper Business, $24), by Esther Wachs Book, a former reporter at Forbes magazine who knows how to put a human face on a business story.
My eyes tend to cross at most management texts, but this one is different. It's not a generalized, predictable tome on how and why women should become leaders. Ms. Book's book is like a series of comfy chats inside a corporate suite. We hear the voices of the women who have broken into the boys' club.
It's lonely there, and the statistics are truly pathetic. In 1999, women held just 12 percent of the senior posts in Fortune 500 companies. And women chief executives are as scarce as pandas. But in broader terms, women still represent power and money -- they control 85 percent of all personal and household spending.
The profiles offer plenty of lessons. For starters, these women never forget their roots.
Marcy Carsey, who developed "The Cosby Show" and "Roseanne," then pitched them to the networks, is the daughter of a shipyard worker and a homemaker from Quincy, Mass. A self-described nerd, Ms. Carsey endured the gray, slushy winters by watching television. Clearly, she understands the untapped market of female viewers. "Roseanne," for instance, portrayed the absurdity of everyday life for working moms.
Ms. Carsey's shows became huge hits: her production company is worth an estimated $1.2 billion and she is now a partner with Oprah Winfrey in Oxygen Media, whose chief executive is Geraldine Laybourne, a former chairwoman of the Nickelodeon cable channel.
Several of these successful women knew hard and dirty work in their childhood. Rebecca Mark slopped hogs in Missouri; she is now chief executive of Azurix, a global water supplier started by Enron. Her Escada blazer and Ebel watch belie her modest farm roots, but the work ethic has remained. After her hotel was bombed during a visit to Bombay, she worked by candlelight to develop a new power plant for the city of Dabhoi. But that probably wasn't as tough as raising her twins while earning her Harvard M.B.A. with distinction. Just reading about her workweek made me want to take a nap.
All of these women also demonstrate the importance of establishing confidence at an early age. Researchers have found that self-esteem for many girls plummets at about the age of 13. One survey cited in the book found that 60 percent of girls are happy in elementary school, but that drops to 29 percent in high school. Boys maintained a higher level of self-esteem.
Sports were important confidence-builders for many of the women, including Meg Whitman, chief executive of eBay, who was a swimmer.
Along with self-confidence, of course, comes the courage to take chances. Ms. Carsey, for instance, quit a comfortable job at the networks, took out a second mortgage and started her company.
MANY of the women lead by example and know how to balance work and family. They go to school plays and don't miss birthday parties. That sends a clear message to their colleagues: "I trust you to get the work done. You don't have to account for every minute of your time."
The book has a couple of flaws. First, the editors could have shown us some mercy by deleting every other use of the word "paradigm." A far greater problem is the excessive fawning over unsympathetic characters like Darla D. Moore. The book chronicles Ms. Moore's time at Chemical Bank, where the bankruptcy and reorganization unit she ran earned millions a year before she joined her husband, Richard E. Rainwater, the billionaire investor, as president of his investment firm.
In her Upper East Side condo, the book says, she displays a floor-to-ceiling oil painting of herself, decked in burgundy taffeta. And the book acknowleges her reputation as a manager who motivates by fear. One of her mantras to employees: "So, what are you wasting your time on today?"
But for my money, the single fat paragraph given to Ms. Moore's and Mr. Rainwater's woes in the Columbia/HCA Healthcare scandal falls short. The two were slow to catch on to Richard L. Scott's management problems at the chain, which Mr. Rainwater founded with Mr. Scott. Eventually, Ms. Moore pushed for Mr. Scott's ouster, but it took a federal investigation into allegations of Medicare fraud to get her attention. Columbia paid hefty penalties in settling the case, and shareholders saw their investment dwindle. But, hey, Ms. Moore wants to be a role model for young M.B.A.'s attending the Darla Moore School of Business, a result of her $25 million contribution to the University of South Carolina. This might not be someone I want my nieces to admire.
But back to the good stuff -- chocolate. Mrs. Gordon's family has controlled Tootsie Roll for 65-plus years. Her grandfather had sold paper to the company and noticed that management was late in paying its bills. Enter Grandma, who saved a bit of her teacher's pay to buy up Tootsie Roll stock. Other relatives did likewise, and the family bought a controlling interest after the Depression.
Her father took young Ellen along with him to work, and she wrote a high school essay on how she wanted to become a businesswoman, a laughable notion in that era.
After college, she and her husband took over the company. She watched General Motors and other American manufacturers lag behind foreign competitors because they failed to invest in new technology. So she invested in high-speed machines and listened to employee feedback.
"As a manager, you really don't know all the answers," she said.
At meetings, many people may drop by to offer their points of view. "That's why my chairs have wheels on them," she said.
The company doesn't even track turnover; most employees have been there for more than 20 years.
PUSHING 70, Mrs. Gordon still gets calls from headhunters with job offers; she rebuffs them. She has no plans to retire but hopes to pass on the Tootsie Roll business someday to one of her daughters or a top manager. "I love the game," she said.
Must be all that chocolate.

Tennis Justice: Court at South St. Seaport Gets a Reprieve

BYLINE: By DENNY LEE

 BODY:
The tennis courts on Piers 13 and 14 below the South Street Seaport were to close in May, because the city, which owns the property, was hoping to redevelop it for other uses.
But after inquiries from the Manhattan borough president's office and Community Board 1, the Economic Development Corporation, the landlord for the property, extended the lease on the courts to Michael Del Prete, who took over from the previous tenant, the New York Health and Racquet Club. 
 Tennis players were ecstatic.
"Elation is not an overstatement," said Samuel P. Sporn, 69, a lawyer. Mr. Sporn, an avid player, collected more than 300 petition signatures to save the courts.
Mr. Del Prete, who owns several other courts in the Bronx, Queens and Brooklyn, has renovated the courts and renamed them the Wall Street Racquet Club. He is expected to sign a one-year lease, renewable for three years. He said he planned to improve programs for children.
"We are going to give scholarships through E.D.C. on an as-needed-basis to children who can't afford to play," he said.
Hourly rates for others will be $30 to $60 for members and about twice that for nonmembers. The city will get $20,000 a month in rent.
Janel Patterson, a spokeswoman for the corporation, said the lease would include a 30-day cancellation notice.
The 30-year-old courts were seen in Woody Allen's film "Annie Hall." The city is still considering plans to replace the courts with a hotel or a Guggenheim museum designed by Frank Gehry. DENNY LEE

A Buyer's Market in Cars and Car Stocks

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
CHARLES DICKENS did not have Detroit in mind when he wrote, "It was the best of times, it was the worst of times." But it sums up the situation for the nation's auto industry.
With the American economy strong and unemployment at near-record lows, automakers are selling all manner of four-wheeled vehicles at a record pace. Profits are good. The companies are flush with cash. Labor disputes look remote. 
 Yet Wall Street has looked at these fundamentals and effectively scoffed, "Big deal." Auto stocks, which peaked during the spring, are down, in some cases substantially. The stock market, analysts say, is expecting a slide in demand -- though it may be many months away and may not come at all.
"The good news is that sales have never been better," said Stephen Girsky, an auto industry analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. "The bad news is that with slowing employment, rising interest rates and rising gasoline prices, sales are going to fall. And the pricing environment is just terrible."
At a seasonally adjusted annual rate of around 17 million vehicles, sales remain at record levels. But they were higher six months ago, and inventories are rising. All these factors have combined to send the stocks skidding.
General Motors, which was trading in the low $90's in May, closed on Friday at $63.25. DaimlerChrysler, which peaked at just over $68 in early April, is now at $56.375. Ford Motor, which most analysts see as the best stock of the lot, has taken only a modest hit. Its shares, which peaked at just over $31 in mid-April, are now at $29.125.
"In a rising interest rate environment and a moderating vehicle sales environment, these stocks tend to perform poorly," said Nicholas Lobaccaro, who follows auto companies for Lehman Brothers. "And you are looking at much heavier supply of the most profitable vehicles and major inroads by foreign manufacturers in trucks and sport utility vehicles."
Indeed, the long-term worry is that worldwide supply of vehicles is far outstripping demand. That is great news for consumers, because it suggests that prices will probably remain under pressure. But it is not positive for corporate profit margins.
"We estimate there are 40 excess assembly plants around the world, which probably means the industry has 100,000 extra employees," said John A. Casesa, an auto analyst at Merrill Lynch.
And more supply is coming. Japanese manufacturers, seeking bigger market share, are committed to bolstering production of light trucks and S.U.V.'s in the North American market, Mr. Casesa said.
An increase in light-truck capacity, which some analysts estimated at 15 percent, would almost certainly threaten profits in the product line that has been Detroit's biggest money-maker.
Some analysts, however, say the worst may be past for the stocks. They contend that that interest rates may have peaked, that the economy is slowing but is not likely to stall, and that gasoline prices are off their highs. And auto stocks are trading much lower than they were three months ago.
David Bradley, an auto industry analyst at J. P. Morgan Securities, turned negative on the stocks in mid-May, when the economy was growing rapidly and the Federal Reserve seemed intent on raising interest rates for the foreseeable future.
He has not changed his view entirely since then, but he says he is feeling a bit better. "I have gone from being quite bearish to a slightly more positive posture," he said. "We are advocating putting a toe in the water where we see opportunity."
But with the economic outlook still muddled, few analysts are sanguine about what will happen on Wall Street.
"I think the stocks will be choppy for the rest of the year, but I think they are undervalued," said Wendy Beale Needham of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. She is recommending Ford and G.M. for purchase.
Indeed, most analysts say Ford seems the best investment. "We have been very cautious on DaimlerChrysler and General Motors, but think Ford can create shareholder value, mainly because of their product pipeline," said Mr. Lobaccaro at Lehman.
Mr. Bradley also likes Ford, but as a short-term play. This month, Ford shareholders approved a proposal to distribute a special $10 billion dividend. Ford, which has already distributed $5.7 billion to investors, could pay for the balance by buying back its stock, he said.
"Even though the stock has popped in the last week or so, Ford clearly has short-term potential," he said. "I think the buyback is worth another 5 percent on the stock."
MR. BRADLEY said investors with longer time horizons might consider G.M. -- not because of its prospects in the motor vehicles sector, but because it still owns 30 percent of Hughes Electronics. Chances are that the company will spin out that remaining portion or split it off in the second half of 2001, he said. "Another spin of Hughes could be worth $20 a share on General Motors stock," he said.
Generally, analysts are less than positive about DaimlerChrysler, which they say has yet to realize the potential of its megamerger nearly two years ago. "Clearly, the merger hasn't gone as well as Daimler would like," Mr. Girsky said.
Mr. Lobaccaro added: "If you look at the current earnings growth rate of DaimlerChrysler, it is hard to reconcile how low it is, if all the synergies they claimed would be realized were actually hitting the bottom line. From a near-term and medium-term perspective, the merger has been a disappointment."

HEADLINE: PORTFOLIOS, ETC.;
Yes, the Euro Will Rebound. Someday.

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
WILL the euro ever rally?
That is a fair question, given the currency's tumble this summer. Despite predictions that it was time for a rebound in the euro, the unified currency of 11 European nations, it is back within striking distance of new lows, bedeviling American investors by erasing gains that they may have made in European equities. 
 After a rally of 8.5 percent from its record low of 88.95 cents on May 4, the euro has fallen 6.4 percent from its recent peak of 96.49 cents, on June 16. It dropped below 90 cents on Wednesday and finished the week at 90.33 cents. That is down 22.6 percent from its debut value of $1.1667 in January 1999.
"It's embarrassing to be a currency forecaster these days," said Anne Mills, senior foreign economist at Brown Brothers Harriman & Company. She is not alone. There is no easy answer to why the euro remains so weak.
The economies of the countries behind the euro are now growing at 3 to 4 percent a year. They are at an earlier stage in their expansion cycle, compared with that of the United States, so they should be able to keep perking along. Their stock markets, while not taking off, are doing better than American equities so far this year. And the European Central Bank has moved to support the euro and to keep inflationary pressures in check, raising its benchmark interest rate by 1.75 percentage points since November. Many analysts expect that inflation and euro worries will prompt another rate increase late this month or in September.
"I find it very difficult to explain the softness of the euro from the European side," said Nicholas P. Sargen, global market strategist for J. P. Morgan's private clients.
The euro has also received help from the United States in the last year, as the Federal Reserve has lifted its benchmark interest rate by 1.75 points, aiming to put a brake on American economic growth. A slowing United States economy should make a rebounding Europe more attractive, especially in a year when the American stock market indexes are in negative territory.
But all that came of this was a six-week rally that started in early May and got its real lift when the Fed raised its target for the federal funds rate by half a point, to 6.50 percent, on May 16.
So what happened? While analysts are not confident of their explanations, they put most of the blame on the strong performance of the United States economy and investors' consequent unwillingness to bet on Europe when American has given them so much.
Rather than worrying that the American economy will slow sharply, investors seem to be betting that the Fed can direct the economy to a soft landing, with growth remaining relatively robust and inflation continuing to be restrained. German jobs data, released last week, may have also created concern; the number of unemployed fell by 9,000 in July, but that was below the predictions of 10,000 to 25,000. The unemployment rate slipped to 9.5 percent, from 9.6 percent.
"What has made us wrong," Ms. Mills of Brown Brothers Harriman said, "is the appetite of Europeans for direct and portfolio investment in the United States."
Karen E. Parker, director of currency research at Chase Securities, pointed out that European companies were still behind their United States competitors in restructuring and in productivity gains. That, too, is probably undermining the euro, she said.
Even the euro pessimists have been surprised. Ms. Parker has been bearish on the currency since its inception. But she had predicted that it would rally this year, in part because the Fed was pushing interest rates higher and the American economy's rapid growth was expected to slow. Last December, she forecast that the euro would be at $1.10 by the end of this year.
Now she predicts that the best the euro can do is 92 cents by year-end and 95 cents by next June. "The most that we are counting on is that the euro has bottomed out," she said. But she is not ruling out a brief side trip to a new low.
"This is one of those major moves that simply take longer to turn around than people think," Ms. Mills said.
She said she felt sure of one development -- although, wisely, she declined to forecast the timing: "Sometime in the next five years, we will be doing the same search for reasons why the dollar is so weak."

In a Humming Economy, A Rising Din of Defaults

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.

 BODY:
WITH the economic expansion setting records for longevity, much of American business is reveling in prosperity. But all is hardly well. For reasons that include profligate lending and underwriting in the second half of the 1990's, many large businesses, and even entire industries, are suffocating from their debts.
A major portion of the health care industry is in shambles. In retailing, competition from category killers has contributed to huge consolidation. And some auto parts suppliers, already beleaguered despite record car sales by Detroit last year, seem to have no place to go but south. 
 That's not all. Household names like Pathmark Stores and United Artists Theatre Company defaulted on bonds this spring and are contributors to a total of $15 billion in defaulted debt across corporate America for the first half of 2000 -- a rate that could smash last year's record of $23.5 billion.
Though the financial disruption at Pathmark and United Artists is nearly invisible to their customers, it is very visible to the bankruptcy lawyers and other people -- please don't call them vultures -- who make their living from corporate distress. For them, business has rarely been better. And judging from the agony in the market for high-yield bonds, probably the best predictor, it is likely to get better still.
"The restructuring industry is in an expansion phase right now," said Al Koch, managing principal at Jay Alix & Associates, a leading specialist in the category. Its staff has nearly tripled in size over the last five years as more companies have needed help in fixing operations and recasting notes and bonds. "Insolvency attorneys are all very, very busy," Mr. Koch added.
Deryck A. Palmer, a partner and restructuring specialist at Weil, Gotshal & Manges, can vouch for that. He points particularly to the bounty that awaits those involved in refinancing hospitals, which he believes are only beginning to feel the crunch that has affected other businesses.
"What's amazing is you have this much activity in a robust economy," Mr. Palmer said.
Whether these exceptions to the boom will lead to a full-fledged credit crunch depends on whom you ask. But there is no doubt that a rising number of companies, running out of financing options, are having to default.
And with nearly all economists agreeing that the Federal Reserve will succeed, sooner or later, in slowing the nation's growth, the corporate distress will probably widen. If the Fed's tightening brings on a recession, as a few analysts now predict for next year, the defaults could intensify the contraction.
As Henry S. Miller, vice chairman of Wasserstein Perella & Company and head of its restructuring business, put it, "Most people who play in this business believe there is a lot more to come."
Moody's Investors Service calculates that 6.2 percent of high-yield, or junk, bonds are now in default. It projects that the rate will rise to 7.1 percent by year-end, and to 8.4 percent by July 2001. Globally, the United States, which has the world's most accessible capital markets, accounts for 75 percent of the defaulted bonds by amount and 85 percent by number of companies.
Most economists doubt that the soured debt will cause more than a blip in the nation's overall economic performance. But Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, watches the figures on distressed loans. And his staff has made inquiries recently about the ill health of the market for high-yield debt, defined as securities rated no higher than Ba-1 by Moody's or BB+ by Standard & Poor's.
HOME casualties are in long-ailing businesses like steel. Others are in highly cyclical ones like heavy equipment. Harnischfeger Industries, a maker of mining equipment, survived the Rust Belt vicissitudes of the 1980's only to be driven into Chapter 11 bankruptcy by overwhelming fixed costs and falling prices in 1999.
Borrowing for what analysts regard as ill-conceived acquisitions has also caused problems. Safety-Kleen, for example, tried to combine such fundamentally different businesses as hazardous-waste disposal with the more routine collection of used motor oil and recyclable materials. In still others, companies fell prey to rapid technological change or, as with hospitals and nursing homes, to new restrictions on government reimbursements.
With a few exceptions, Internet companies have not made much use of the bond market, because of a ready supply, at least until this year, of equity capital. As a result, few have defaulted.
Analysts say bad strategies or bad execution, or sometimes both, could not have occurred without a severe relaxation in standards that allowed weak companies to borrow freely from banks and bond investors.
From 1996 to 1999, said Edward Altman, a finance professor at New York University and a consultant to Salomon Smith Barney, "you had a huge number of low-quality issues coming to market." As proof, Dr. Altman said, defaults showed up within a year or two of the financings, instead of the more typical three or four years.
Mr. Hamilton agreed that the ease of raising money in the bond market in 1997 and 1998 "sowed the seeds for the current crop of defaults."
As the cash flows necessary for repaying bonds and loans failed to materialize, banks began to tighten their credit standards, even more so in the wake of Russia's 1998 default. The Fed put pressure on the banks to acknowledge their mistakes by using some of their profits to increase reserves to cover dubious loans. Also, lenders and debt markets became far less hospitable to companies needing to refinance.
"Credit standards have tightened up and they've got nowhere to go," Mr. Koch said. "Three years ago, you could go to the bank across the street but you can't do that anymore. And the bond markets are closed to them."
In the past, Mr. Koch said, companies could routinely be rescued with fairly straightforward financial fixes like persuading investors to swap their bonds for freshly issued stock. But companies now find that they need to make their operations far more efficient, too. He cited Trans World Airlines as a company that still needed to improve operations if it is to head off its third descent into bankruptcy.
In a report published last month by Salomon Smith Barney, Dr. Altman found not only that the default rate on bonds jumped to 1.58 percent in the second quarter, from 1 percent in the first quarter, but also that so-called distressed debt had reached "somewhat ominous" levels. Distressed bonds have yields to maturity at least 10 percentage points above those of similar Treasury securities.
Some 17 percent of high-yield debt was in this category on June 30, compared with 9 percent at the end of last year and just 3 percent at the end of 1998. And Moody's downgraded the debt of twice as many companies as it upgraded in the first half of this year, the highest ratio since 1991, when the last recession ended.
STILL, the cumulative total of defaulted and distressed debt, estimated at 23 percent of the amount outstanding at midyear, remains far below the 43 percent in 1992. In fact, some analysts contend that prices on high-yield debt have fallen to bargain levels, with the average yield at 13 percent.
"We feel the Fed is basically done with interest-rate increases," said Steven A. Ruggiero, director of high-yield research at Chase Securities. He calls high-yield debt a "good place to be" for investors, provided that they are in a mutual fund or closed-end fund and that it constitutes no more than 10 percent of a portfolio.

Oil Prices Falling? Don't Count On It

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.

 BODY:
AFTER a sharp run-up, which helped put gasoline back onto front pages in the spring after a long absence, oil prices have subsided and politicians rail no longer about supposed industry gouging.
Investors seem unshaken in thinking oil prices can only slide further, following the pattern traced after the 1973-74 Arab embargo, the 1979-82 period that included revolution in Iran and the 1991 Persian Gulf war. 
 But Charles T. Maxwell, regarded as the dean of Wall Street's oil analysts, contends that things are different now. Mr. Maxwell, with Weeden & Company, made the case on Thursday for his against-the-grain view. Here are excerpts from the conversation.
 
Q. You're predicting that oil will average $24 a barrel through 2003 in contrast to a Wall Street consensus that it will return to $18 to $20 within the next year or two. Why?
 
A. Excess world capacity, what could quickly be brought into production, has ranged between about 7 and 10 percent over the last 50 years. It reached 18 percent in 1986, when prices collapsed. Today it's around 5 percent, and we need 2 to 2 1/2 percent as a cushion against emergency, such as weather or strikes. So we are as tight now as I have seen in my 44 years studying the industry. It's not political maneuvering by OPEC -- the oil physically isn't there.
 
Q. Is this a result of reduced supply or higher demand?
 
A. Both. Low prices until recently not only created disincentives to invest, but they've also limited the capital available to invest because earnings collapsed. And then demand rebounded in the Far East and Europe, and we've got unprecedented prosperity in America.
 
Q. But profits are now pretty robust, right?
 
A. It takes as much as four years from the time a major development project gets approved to the time when oil begins to flow. Besides, national oil companies in Venezuela and elsewhere must compete for budget money, and the Exxon Mobils of the world are sensitive to stockholder values and their own options. Every dollar they put into buying back shares because they're cheap is a dollar that doesn't go into the drill bit.
 
Q. Is the tight market what caused the price of gasoline to jump recently, to as much as $2.50 a gallon in the Midwest?
 
A. It may have been a modest contributor, but what happened there was basically an environmental issue -- making reformulated gasoline. They brought in supplies from other areas, and the problem quickly dissipated.
 
Q. So will the government investigation prove to be fruitless?
 
A. No investigation we've had yet has found a conspiracy of the oil companies. I'm not going to say there weren't individual operators or terminals that were gouging.
 
Q. If profits are good and you think oil will stay above $20, why are most industry stocks, except for the oil-field service and exploration companies, in the dumps?
 
A. Investors have "learned" from experience that a high price elicits an investment cycle, which creates an expanded supply, which drops the price quickly and leaves them hanging. And while I think the process this time will be gradual, irregular and stretched out, the business is regarded as more cyclical than 20 years ago, when people saw growth in it.
As the price of oil holds in the mid-20's, I expect people to realize what good value these stocks are. The stocks have suffered from being "old economy."
 
Q. Hasn't Chevron, for one, been bragging about becoming a high-tech company?
 
A. Let's be serious. They're going to do a little Internet purchasing, but I think it's laughable. When Internet P/E's get low enough, they won't even mention it again.
 
Q. Will the industry continue to consolidate?
 
A. The game's not over. Chevron probably won't merge, but Texaco is likely, with Royal Dutch the most logical candidate. Conoco, Amerada Hess and Phillips would be perfect for takeover. Phillips, which doubled reserves when it bought ARCO's Alaskan assets, is most appealing, selling for 9 times earnings, compared with 15 1/2 for its peers.
 
Q. Do oil companies stand to gain if George W. Bush and Dick Cheney, both of whom worked in the industry, win in November?
 
A. When push comes to shove, the parties would make geopolitical decisions about such things as imports and subsidies pretty much the same way. But Bush's would be a looser environmental policy, on offshore drilling, say, than Gore's.
 
Q. How did Mr. Cheney do as chairman of Halliburton, whose stock has a P/E of 65 and has jumped 30 percent this year?
 
A. I wouldn't call him a brilliant businessman, but he did a workmanlike job organizing the company, putting a face on it and winning business. He certainly met the expectations of the people who put him in.

HEADLINE: Los Angeles, Back on the Money Map

BYLINE: By LAURA M. HOLSON

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
FOR one bright but ultimately fleeting moment in the 1980's, the financial industry here was as hot as Malibu in August.
Michael Milken, the former Drexel Burnham Lambert financier, presided over an X-shaped desk in Beverly Hills, managing a brain trust that helped finance the restructuring of corporate America. The headquarters for two of the country's largest commercial banks, Security Pacific Bank and First Interstate, anchored the downtown business district. And the savings and loan business prospered, offering cheap loans to home buyers and fueling California's housing boom. 
 In a place built on the notion that fantasies can be manufactured with little more than plywood and good lighting, financiers became the Hollywood equivalent of bankable stars. Even Wall Street was awestruck by the hundred-million-dollar bonuses and huge fees generated by the junk-bond legerdemain of Mr. Milken and his minions.
But fame, like natural beauty, can fade. By the end of the decade, many of the movers and shakers who enjoyed the city's moment in the sun were burned badly. Drexel declared bankruptcy in 1990; Mr. Milken served time in prison for securities violations. The major commercial banks were taken over. And many of the savings institutions, like Columbia Savings and Loan Association, crumbled under the weight of too much debt.
In time, Silicon Valley, the center up north of almost all things wired, grew to a point that, though its only game was venture capital, it could claim status as the financial capital of the West.
Yet Angelenos have always been adept at reinventing themselves. And quietly, the city's financial types are trying to do just that. A new generation of financiers is emerging in Los Angeles, providing financing in more diverse ways than before.
Fledgling idea factories, called "incubators" because they seek to grow new companies quickly, are sprouting up from Pasadena to Santa Monica. Young, wealthy technology entrepreneurs are turning themselves into angels -- investors who use their own money to back ideas in which they believe. Even investment banks are growing again. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, for example, one of the premiere Wall Street institutions, has doubled the size of its banking staff in Los Angeles in the last three years, to 32 professionals, adding bankers to cover the burgeoning new-media industry.
Most noticeably, the venture capital business has had a facelift. The number of venture firms based in Los Angeles County has grown fourfold since 1995, to 32, according to the National Venture Capital Association.
The money raised, meanwhile, quadrupled between 1997 and 1999, when it reached $1.34 billion, according to the VentureOne Corporation which also tracks the venture capital industry. That is much more than in any other county in Southern California, which raised $5.4 billion over all in the last 15 months. Such numbers probably come as a surprise to many.
"This level of venture investment will likely transform the self-image of Los Angeles from an entertainment and defense economy to an entrepreneurial and technology environment," said Dave Witherow, chief executive of VentureOne in San Francisco.
Of course, Los Angeles will never rival Wall Street, with its abundance of brokerage firms, commercial banks and investment firms. And it is no sure thing that this generation of financial innovators will have more staying power than the one that preceded it. Already, a handful of promising endeavors have not panned out.
And some seasoned venture capitalists are playing down the prospect that Los Angeles will come into its own anytime soon. Sure, Silicon Valley financiers are making investments in Southern California companies. But they are not moving here. Instead, they are choosing to set up new operations in London or, in the case of the blue-chip firm Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield & Byers, remain focused on start-ups close to home.
"That is not a decision by omission," said John Doerr, a partner at Kleiner and one of the most sought-after venture capitalists. While Kleiner plans to make some investments in Southern California companies, he said, it has no plans to open offices there.
 
The Digital Chess Game
An example of the new class of investors that is rising here is Stephen Rader, a co-founder last May of Clarity Partners, a $1 billion venture firm. For him, the less competition from outsiders like Mr. Doerr, the better. "This is great to hear," he said, sounding upbeat during an interview in his ninth-floor office not far from Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills. "They figure they can fly in and do it? Great," he said. "We are across the street."
Los Angeles deal makers have been buzzing about Mr. Rader and his Clarity team all summer. It seems that almost anyone with a desk, a pile of cash and a Rolodex can claim to be a venture capitalist these days, but the Clarity team has experience running companies and, some industry experts say, promises to be the firm to watch.
Why? Mr. Rader, for one, helped take public Univision Communications, the Spanish-language television company, in 1996. His partner, Rudy Reinfrank, has managed investments for the Disney family and Marvin Davis. Two other partners, Barry Porter and David Lee, who has a Ph.D. in physics, are founding executives of Global Crossing, a fast-growing telecommunications upstart with offices in Beverly Hills.
The four are close friends as well as business colleagues: Mr. Rader and Mr. Reinfrank were introduced by their wives 25 years ago, Mr. Rader said. In the 1980's, both Mr. Rader and Mr. Porter were investment bankers at Bear Stearns in New York. "This time is an inflection point for telecommunications and traditional media," Mr. Porter said.
Unlike their peers, who have concentrated on one aspect or another of the Internet, say e-business, Clarity's partners expect to invest in five areas: network infrastructure, wireless communications, service providers (like Global Crossing), e-commerce and broadband media.
But besides seeking investments for its own fund, Clarity is providing advice to media executives who, perplexed by their inability to crack the Hollywood code, need help navigating the e-tainment world. "They say, 'You guys are in L.A. What do you think we should do?' " Mr. Porter said. "They are sifting through this treasure trove and don't understand the digital environment."
That is especially true in the wake of several announced mergers of old and new media. "You make a choice like Vivendi-Universal and there is a finality to it," added Mr. Rader, referring to the recently announced acquisition of the Seagram Company, which owns Universal Studios, by Vivendi S.A., the diversified French company. "This is a chess game and you can see how the pieces are being taken off the board."
 
A Financial Culture Clash
It is no surprise that outsiders are vexed by the "Let's do lunch" crowd. Hollywood hates party crashers and, like the British upper class, has peculiar customs that preclude success by the uninitiated. Bryan Lourd, a partner at the Creative Artists Agency, a talent agency in Beverly Hills, said: "It looks like English. It sounds like English. But it is a very different way of doing business."
Just ask Matthew Cowan. In 1996, Mr. Cowan, then an executive at the Intel Corporation and now a partner at Bowman Capital in San Mateo, Calif., moved into an office at the headquarters of the Creative Artists Agency to help it set up a technology lab and invest in emerging media companies. But after a little more than two years, he packed his bags and moved back home, frustrated with a business culture at odds with that in Silicon Valley.
His biggest complaint was about the blatant disregard for a start-up's Spartan budget. First, he said, there was the entertainment executive who demanded that he have three assistants along with a private car and driver. The man also insisted on giving parties that were closer to theatrical productions, with costly headline bands, than friendly afternoon beer bashes. "You sat there watching your small bank account dwindling," he said. "It is upsetting to see so much capital go into people's pockets and not into building companies."
Further, he added, executives were reluctant to acknowledge failure -- a badge of honor in Silicon Valley -- and did not learn from their mistakes. "In L.A. I didn't see a lot of course-correcting going on," Mr. Cowan said.
Even those who live and work in Los Angeles are wary of the entertainment industry's naivete when it comes to creating ideas that will sell on the Internet. Greg Martin, an associate at Redpoint Ventures' offices in Los Angeles, warned: "People in Hollywood think their taste is better. They think they are funnier. My comment to that is if you have better taste than me, then I'm not going to get it anyway."
 
Finding the New Winners
Still, if there is money to be made in new ventures, financiers are often the first to figure out how it can be done. And no one has had a better seat watching the changing Los Angeles financial scene than Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. A decade ago, Ken Moelis, a former Drexel managing director who is now head of Donaldson's corporate finance department, joined the firm with nine Drexel associates in tow. Since then, the banking staff has grown to 120 professionals. It is by far the most prominent office of any Wall Street firm here, including the Goldman Sachs Group, Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch.
Los Angeles County has always claimed its fair share of the California economy; real estate and industrial manufacturing are predominant. But the mix is changing, Mr. Moelis said, and along with it, his business. About two-thirds of the revenue from Donaldson's Los Angeles office now comes from advising technology, media and telecommunications companies, particularly younger concerns. To illustrate how the economy has shifted, David Posnick, one of Mr. Moelis's colleagues, suggested following the career paths of some Drexel alumni.
Consider Art Bilger, who used to be co-head of investment banking at Drexel. In 1990, when the firm filed for bankruptcy, he left to become a partner in Apollo Management, a buyout shop started by former Drexel executives. In the mid-1990's, he served a short stint as president of the New World Communications Group, the television broadcaster, and later joined Akamai Technologies, the Internet information delivery service, as a vice chairman. In his latest career turn, he started Shelter Ventures, a fund that invests in -- you guessed it -- communications and media.
"Los Angeles is a small town on the business side," Mr. Moelis said in a recent interview. To prove his point, he turned and looked out the glass wall of his 33rd floor office in Century City and pointed out several new financial ventures in the row of high-rises leading to the Santa Monica beaches. "We can almost see each other," he said. "People know where to make phone calls to make things happen. That's what kind of place this is."
 
The Incubator Experiment
Four miles from Mr. Moelis's tower, an example of the most recent business phenomenon of the technological age is tucked away in a small office complex in Santa Monica: Ecompanies, a factory-like builder, or incubator, of Internet start-ups. At first glance, it looks like a typical start-up itself, with concrete floors, exposed air ducts, the obligatory table-tennis game and a shower stall in a side room. There is also a surfboard hanging in the lobby, and on one recent day, the 29-year-old co-founder, Sky Dayton, who also started the Internet portal Earthlink, dashed around the office eagerly showing off the stitches in his forehead from a recent surfing accident.
Incubator is a dirty word on Wall Street these days. Analysts, for one, are questioning this get-rich-quick approach to building companies, where entrepreneurs are offered a soup-to-nuts menu of services that include business development, recruiting and marketing advice. "So far the incubator model is unproven," said Mr. Witherow of VentureOne.
As a result, shares in several of those that have already gone public -- including CMGI and the Internet Capital Group -- are trading well below their highs. Idealabs, the Pasadena-based brainchild of the entrepreneur Bill Gross, has also run into trouble. Almost all of the public companies in its portfolio have stumbled recently, some down as much as 90 percent since the technology-stock meltdown in April.
Not surprisingly, Idealabs has delayed its own initial public offering until the market is more receptive. Executives there declined several requests for interviews, citing the pending offering.
But Wall Street's discomfort with the incubator business model is of little concern to Ecompanies' other co-founder Jake Winebaum, 41, a former chairman of Walt Disney's Buena Vista Internet Group. He says he does not feel pressure to take Ecompanies public anytime soon. "The rationale for starting this," he said, "was not to start an incubator." Instead, he added, he and Mr. Dayton want to be efficient entrepreneurs.
On average, Ecompanies has created one company a month since it opened last year. But none have gone public yet, and critics say it has had few successes, with the exception of Icebox, an Internet content creator.
In many ways, Ecompanies has become its own experiment, changing to suit the difficult and amorphous investing environment. Recently, the venture capital arm of Ecompanies has had trouble raising funds, industry executives said. As a result, Ecompanies is expected to unveil several partnerships with both old- and new-economy players in the next week. Mr. Winebaum would not discuss any pending changes at the company.
He did say is that the past year has been one of lessons learned. Most important, the strategy group -- Step One in Ecompanies' "Henry Ford approach" to creating companies -- no longer writes the business plan for a new concern. That is left to the founding executives, he said, so that "the idea becomes their own." Second, Ecompanies' executives have learned not to micromanage start-ups, letting them succeed or fail on their own. In particular, the venture arm of Ecompanies is less likely to invest in in-house companies, forcing entrepreneurs to find their own financing. "If we do too much for a company then it fails," he said.
He cited Eparties, an online party service inspired by his grade-school-aged daughter. He said Eparties' executives were ill-equipped for the rigors of the corporate suite, having been coddled by Ecompanies' advisers. And Ecompanies, for its part, failed to recognize that the company could not survive on its own. As a result, certain Eparties assets were sold to eToys in June for $1.6 million in stock. "It's amazingly like parenting," he said, reflecting on the experience. "Your child does most of its growth when it leaves. But when they want to move back in you ask, 'What are you doing here?' "
 
The Upside of Networking
Randall Kaplan, the 31-year-old founder of Jump Investors, a network of individuals with $50 million to invest in young companies, is the first to acknowledge that he was in the right place at the right time when he helped write the business plan for the wildly successful Akamai Technologies.
"I'm not the most intelligent guy in the world," he said. "But I don't have to be. I'm a hard worker, and I have a good business gut." The payoff for his yearlong stint with Akamai included options on an estimated three million shares of stock -- now valued at more than $200 million -- and the opportunity to join the leisure class of young Los Angeles investors who have decided to manage their own affairs.
But what Mr. Kaplan does best is not what he most wants to be remembered for: networking. If there is any doubt, consider his 13-page, single-spaced, coded correspondence log from 1995. It is a who's who of Hollywood finance -- more than 360 phone calls or meetings -- and shows how organized and determined the young Mr. Kaplan can be. Still, in a recent interview, he balked at the comparison, almost with disdain. "I'm not a Hollywood guy," he said.
When Jump takes a stake in a company, he said, he wants to be a hands-on investor who can influence the direction the company takes. And that, he contended, "is different than 'let's do lunch.' "
Mr. Kaplan has put about $25 million of his own money into Jump, with the other $25 million coming from 54 other investors. For the privilege of being part of the Jump network, participants must be active investors willing to help entrepreneurs the way a venture capitalist would.
Among this new class of investor-cum-adviser, said Mr. Moelis at Donaldson, "the lines are blurring." They emulate venture capitalists, but are not beholden to investors like pension funds and colleges who pay them a management fee.
For Mr. Kaplan, a Michigan native who got his start at SunAmerica, the insurer, under Eli Broad, his new wealth gives him access to promising companies and the freedom to pick and choose whom he wants to work with.
"If I called John Doerr, he may not take my call," he said. Then he smiles, rethinking his answer in light of his recent success. "Well, maybe now he will."

End Of The ZIRP

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
We interrupt America's political silly season to bring you a special bulletin: something important and disturbing just happened in Japan.
O.K., I admit that it doesn't look important, especially to Americans. So what if last Friday the Bank of Japan finally ended its "zero interest rate policy" (yes, ZIRP)? After all, it's only a quarter-point rise, in a faraway country that doesn't interest most Americans now that it no longer seems a dangerous competitor. And yet I would not be surprised if future economic historians look back at Friday's move as the beginning of the end for an era, and not just in Japan. 
 For one thing, this move by the Bank of Japan is a much bigger deal than you might think, because of its potential impact on expectations. By raising interest rates, even slightly, when the economy is still depressed, the B.O.J. in effect signals anyone in Japan who might be feeling stirrings of exuberance that it is likely to step on the brakes in earnest if the economy actually shows any signs of booming, or if consumer prices start to rise even slightly.
Consider the contrast: in this country the markets expect the Fed to hold off for a while on interest rate increases even though inflation is running at more than 3 percent. Meanwhile the B.O.J. has just raised interest rates in an economy where consumer prices are actually falling, G.D.P. is lower than it was three years ago, and unemployment is at a postwar high. This says something about what kind of policy Japan can expect from its central bank in the future -- and it's not the sort of thing that would encourage people to go out and spend.
My personal guess is that in the near future, whatever optimism people are now feeling about Japan's economy will evaporate, and the nation's malaise will be deeper than ever -- thanks in large part to Friday's action. And while others are more sanguine, both the International Monetary Fund and Japan's own Ministry of Finance pleaded with the Bank of Japan not to raise rates.
So why did the Bank of Japan do it? Its officials have been talking up the need for higher rates for months, yet have never been able to provide any coherent rationale. Mainly, they claim that ZIRP makes life too easy for corporations, that it lets them put off tough decisions. But there's no evidence for this -- on the contrary, despite the zero interest rate, corporate Japan has lately been experiencing an unprecedented series of high-profile bankruptcies. And anyway, since when is it the central bank's job to strengthen the private sector's moral fiber?
Arguably, what we really have here is a newly independent central bank frustrated by the fact that in a depressed economy it has no good reason to do what central bankers like to do -- that is, preach austerity, take away the punch bowl just as the party really gets going and all that. And so, probably unconsciously, Bank of Japan officials began looking for reasons to act in central-bankerly ways. As B.O.J.-watchers have pointed out, over the past few months the bank has been systematically "changing the goal posts," finding new reasons to tighten. It looks very much like the behavior of someone who starts with the answer then goes looking for the right question. And once they had talked up the possibility, it seems, officials at the B.O.J. felt that they would lose face if they didn't raise rates -- that they had to go ahead with the move precisely because the Ministry of Finance was against it.
It's no way to run an economy -- and that is why this is a story with ramifications that extend far beyond Japan.
For we are, as I pointed out last week, living in the age of the central banker -- an era in which elected officials around the world have been persuaded to leave a key economic policy in the hands of unelected technocrats. It's a delicate balancing act at best -- even Alan Greenspan has succumbed to the temptation to overreach, to make pronouncements on policy matters outside his jurisdiction. And he at least has done well in his proper job.
Now along comes the world's third most important central bank, redefining its mission so as to justify an interest rate increase that makes no sense on conventional economic grounds -- and arguably doing so mainly in order to give itself a bigger role. Is this the beginning of the end for central bank independence, not only in Japan but around the world?

HEADLINE: This Is Extremely Sporting

BYLINE: By PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO

 BODY:
SEE. See Lee. See Lee Dansie, a champion street luger with a Mick Jagger haircut, come streaking through the fog toward the Pacific Ocean on a flying bit of metal, shoes smoking.
It's the 2000 X Games, in which some 450 athletes from 23 countries participate in such once-renegade "extreme" sports as dirt-bike jumping, aggressive in-line skating, street luge and sky-surfing. That last is the ultimate exercise in narcissism, in which a surf-rider and a camera flyer, sky-surfboards strapped to their feet and parachutes to their backs, jump simultaneously out of a plane at 13,000 feet, and fall for 9,000 feet or so, spiraling, flipping and diving as they hurl merrily toward earth at about 180 miles per hour, filming all the while. 
 Not surprisingly, this city of extremes, both topographical and economic, has embraced the X games with messianic fervor. Last summer, the event drew over 270,000 spectators, not to mention over five million ESPN viewers, including 37 percent of all male teenagers in the United States, according to Nielsen analysis for the company. (The games will start on Thursday; delayed television coverage starts on ABC and ESPN this Saturday.)
Josh Blackman, 5, standing bug-eyed on Friday as the lugers, bigger boys with iron abdominals, whizzed past him in a practice event, succinctly summed up the appeal of the lugers: "They turn and they wreck."
The games, now six years old -- an eternity in youth culture -- as well as the newer Gravity Games on NBC, are spawning extremes of their own. This fall, for instance, will see the debut of not one but two brands of extreme sports trading cards. The stunt biker Dave Mirra, the Michael Jordan of the dirt set, has his own chewing gum (Dave Mirra's BMX Bubble Gum), as well as his own pro model signature Adidas sneaker as well as a cereal en route.
Numerous athletes, including the skateboarder Tony Hawk, ace executor of "the 900" (two and a half turns in the air on a skateboard off a vertical ramp), have their own video games, and extreme action figures and finger-size street luges and dirt bikes are popping up at toy stores near you. (Mr. Dansie, soon to be an action figure, said he was looking forward to his check.)
In perhaps the unkindest blow to the dwindling band of athletes who are corporation-shunning street-purists, a Barney-colored miniature "vert ramp" with skateboard now comes with every McDonald's Happy Meal.
"It's just the way things work," said Chad Kagy, a 21-year-old stunt biker and bronze medalist from Gilroy, Calif., who may resemble Harry Potter on his Nimbus 2000 broomstick as he performs his favorite trick this week. Dubbed the Superman Seat Grab, the move has his feet soaring behind the bike while his left hand grabs the seat and his right hand spins the handlebars (got that?). "One day you're riding with your friends," he said. "The next day people want you to represent their bubble gum."
The extremely big business of extreme sports has been fueled not only by television but by extreme agents, who now represent approximately 20 percent of all athletes competing in the games.
Extreme marketing is extending far beyond sports figures and products. In sportswear, ankle-high skateboarding shoes are replacing hightops, and cargo pants with extra pockets have become teenage uniforms. Adolescent males and those beyond can avail themselves of Right Guard Xtreme Deodorant.
Steve Astephen, founder of The Familie, an alternative youth marketing agency that represents extreme athletes, says that the days of "hey bro" sponsorship were over, which he defined as an ex-rider coming up to a rider and saying: "Hey bro, what's going on? Wear our sticker and we'll give you a couple of bucks." Corporations, Mr. Astephen said, have woken up to the fact that extreme athletes speak to the lucrative market of Y Generation (12- to 24-year-old) males and their $650 billion in annual spending power. The lure: individualistic sports that look cool and don't require a team.
"These guys are tangible heroes," Mr. Astephen said of his stable. "Tony Hawk tours local skate parks and skates with your son or daughter. When's the last time you saw Tiger Woods or Michael Jordan doing that?"
Looking svelte for a 47-year-old in racing leathers, Steve Fernando, a Los Angeles firefighter who took up street luging after watching it on television, offered a contrasting theory.
"So many people are having virtual thrills through computers and Playstations," he said. "We're an adjunct on TV, seen through a point-of-view camera."
Mark Bryant, editor of Men's Journal, a bible of testosterone, notes that every generation has its instruments of rebellion, whether electric guitars or scooters whizzing up Eighth Avenue.
Extreme sports, he said, "reject the apparent dullness of modern life, at least as perceived by a 20-year-old." He sees them as an attempt to "juice up life," to inject a note of edginess into a flush economy.
"We're at the point where certain socioeconomic groups are thinking, if life is full of so many possibilities, why am I not having more fun?" he said.
The irony, of course, is that efforts to market the extreme naturally take the edge right out of it. Or, as Mr. Bryant put it, "What could be more mundane than deodorant?"

From Chile's Army, Little but the Sound of Fury

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

DATELINE: SANTIAGO, Chile

 BODY:
CHILEAN soldiers still march to the tune of the stern martial music -- the Badenweiler, Nibelung and Ferbelin -- that the Prussians brought with them in 1885 when Chile invited them to modernize its army. The soldiers' medals, uniforms and goose-stepping also evoke that era, making the force appear profoundly anachronistic, even in a nation as traditionbound as this one.
But until recently, the misfit was only superficial. Even a decade ago, Chile's armed forces still had a powerful grip on the country, overseeing not only its defense, but also its economic and political affairs. A law unto themselves, they rousted dissidents from their beds and tortured and executed them at will. 
 Now, though, they are losing their commanding position in Chilean society. That became strikingly evident last week, as Gen. Augusto Pinochet, their former leader, was stripped of his senatorial immunity by the Supreme Court, clearing the way for his probable arrest and trial. In response, all the top military commanders could do was grumble, publicly and bitterly.
"The political role of the military is diminishing little by little," said Francisco Javier Cuadra, a lawyer who was General Pinochet's chief of staff between 1984 and 1987. "And as Pinochet leaves the stage, its profile will diminish even further."
Two major events created the slope the military is sliding down, which is all the more noteworthy because old authoritarian habits are returning in neighboring Peru and some other South American countries.
One, of course, was the arrest of General Pinochet in London two years ago on a Spanish warrant charging him with gross violations of human rights, including kidnapping, murder and torture. The arrest encouraged a rush of attention to human rights abuses in this usually closed society and emboldened prosecuting judges to investigate and charge scores of retired and acting police and military officers. When the prosecutions began, the general was not around to quash them. The military's accustomed impunity began to erode.
Then the Chilean government, pressing for General Pinochet's return, argued that he should face Chilean rather than Spanish justice as a matter of sovereignty, and the military -- which does not want him to face any trial at all -- went along. Since March, when the general returned to Chile after the British released him on humanitarian grounds, he has been too weak to block the prosecutions of fellow officers.
The other crucial event was Chile's election of Ricardo Lagos in January as the first Socialist president since 1973, when General Pinochet overthrew Salvador Allende with the help of the Nixon administration. In his first months in power, Mr. Lagos has pushed forward the economic deregulation policies first pioneered by General Pinochet and eliminated capital restrictions loathed by Wall Street.
With Marxism no longer a problem, the United States, which strongly supported the Pinochet coup, is now strongly backing civilian rule. Domestic fears of Communism have faded, too, removing the armed forces' chief argument for one of the largest per capita military budgets in Latin America. Chile's business community, while maintaining support for General Pinochet, has drawn back from pushing the military to intervene to protect him, because they know such turbulence would deter international credit, investment and trade as the country emerges from a recession.
A third factor is simply the passage of time. Commanders have rotated, and the most senior of the Pinochet era have retired. Younger officers remain devoted to General Pinochet, but most focus on relations with the politicians who hold the purse strings for the new frigates, fighter jets and tanks they say they desperately need.
Likewise, a new generation on the Supreme Court (only three of 20 justices remain from General Pinochet's time) has ruled that cases of missing people can be treated as kidnappings. Until a body is produced, a kidnapping case is considered open. The approach has opened a multitude of cases that had been shut by a 1978 amnesty for political crimes -- including killings -- decreed under General Pinochet.
That pushed the armed forces to the negotiating table with human rights lawyers and led to top officers' signing a document in June that promised their assistance in finding the bodies of the missing, in exchange for testifying in private and receiving immunity. The agreement was the first time the military acknowledged that members of the security forces had played a role in the wrongful death of anybody and the first time it publicly retreated from old rebuttals that either the disappeared had been killed in civil conflicts or that they were not dead at all, but had merely left the country.
"It was a great advance," said Mario Fernandez Baeza, President Lagos's defense minister. "Only two years ago, a large sector of the society, including the armed forces in a quiet way, justified those abuses."
NOW, with even its border disputes with Peru and Argentina settled over the last three years, the military is trying to learn to live without enemies. That may mean living with new masters.
Mr. Lagos has begun negotiations with conservative lawmakers to change the constitution written during the Pinochet era, which gives the military special powers, including wide-ranging autonomy and representation in the Senate. He has also been forthright about claiming his superiority over the armed forces, on several occasions publicly scolding military chiefs.
After Gen. Ricardo Izurieta, the army chief, defiantly told reporters he needed no one's permission to visit General Pinochet after last week's ruling, Mr. Lagos observed, sharply: "The command of our country rests on what I decide."
Until recently such a clash would have sent shudders through Chile. But General Izurieta has learned to balance his relations with two civilian presidents and hard-liners within the armed forces unhappy that he has not better defended General Pinochet. After his words of defiance, he immediately reiterated the military's promise to seek the whereabouts of the missing. Mr. Lagos, for his part, said he did not mind that General Izurieta and other commanders made a courtesy visit to their old leader.
"It's a completely regulated conflict," said Mr. Cuadra, the former Pinochet aide. "It's political theater with both Lagos and Izurieta each playing a role and each knowing the other's lines in the libretto."

Has a Familiar Market Ghost Returned?

BYLINE: By JOAN M. O'NEILL

 BODY:
The markets received a familiar configuration of economic data last week: a tame report on wholesale inflation that was coupled with a retail sales report showing that American consumers had returned to the profligate spending seen earlier this year.
 The Federal Reserve will meet next on Aug. 22 to decide whether any further tweaking in interest rates is needed to fend off inflation. The board is widely expected to let the six tightenings of the last year continue working, and go no further for now. 
 But the verve of recent consumer spending will keep investors alert this week to the July consumer price report - they'll be looking for any signs of resurgence in street-level prices. Among other reports due, business inventories, industrial production and another gauge of purchasing, the trade balance figures, will be examined for confirmation of any revival in consumer spending.
 On Friday, the Dow Jones index rallied as investors swapped out of technology shares and into old economy blue chips. The Dow ended up 260.05 points on the week, or 2.4 percent, at 11,027.80 points, finishing above the 11,000 mark for the first time in four months. The chastened Nasdaq closed the week up a shade, 2.11 points, to 3,789.47 points. JOAN M. O'NEILL

And Now for Something Completely Different . . .

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
NO matter whether you think Al Gore should be the next president, give him this much: He has transformed the vice presidency, the subject of generations of derision, into more than the butt of jokes. Not content to languish at state funerals, Mr. Gore has been the most productive and industrious vice president in modern times.
Even Gov. George W. Bush, in a rare compliment to his rival, volunteered recently that Mr. Gore had been a good No. 2. 
 So it is remarkable that Mr. Gore's political coming out here this week has been designed not merely as the usual paean to the party's new standard-bearer, but also as a production that will neglect, obscure and even expunge his time in what he calls the "Square Office," only 18 steps down the blue-carpeted corridor from the Oval Office.
Instead, the program calls for speaker after speaker to rattle on about Al Gore the Tennessee farm boy, Al Gore the Harvard student, Al Gore the enlistee in Vietnam, Al Gore the reporter, Al Gore the House member, Al Gore the senator and -- blithely skipping the last eight years -- Al Gore, the man of the future.
Forget that Mr. Gore championed an ambitious program to streamline the federal bureaucracy, or that he was the point man in relations with Russia, or that he bested Ross Perot in a debate, clearing the path for the North American Free Trade Agreement. Until he deletes the word "vice" from his title, the political calculation is that Mr. Gore will not be seen as his own man.
Perhaps unfairly, Governor Bush, who presides over a single state (one in which the chief executive office is notably weak) and is far less seasoned in governing, can more easily claim the leadership mantle because he, at least, is in charge of something.
In fact, voters are apt to say Mr. Bush is as experienced a leader as Mr. Gore. Asked in a poll taken in late March whether Mr. Gore's performance as vice president made them more or less likely to support him, 28 percent of registered voters said more likely, 27 percent said less likely and 43 percent said it made no difference.
Mr. Gore's most aggressive move to submerge his vice presidency came last week when he named a No. 2 of his own. By making history in picking Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, the first Jewish running mate of a major party, Mr. Gore succeeded in persuading at least some voters to take another measure of him as a decisive, imaginative leader.
Yet in unveiling Senator Lieberman, Mr. Gore was so determined to shed his own service as No. 2 that he made no reference to the office itself or to his first-hand knowledge of why it is vital to have a capable second-in-command. The Gore campaign has been so determined to blot out the vice president from Al Gore that his title was intentionally not included in mentions of him in the Democratic platform.
Some strategists and academics argue that it is folly for Mr. Gore to flee from the governing credentials that would seem to be his most compelling selling point. If anything, they argue, six years after the Gingrich revolution that catapulted Washington outsiders into power, voters may be ready for tested steadiness.
Gary Jacobson, a political science professor at the University of California at San Diego, said, "His strongest suit is, 'You've never had it so good.' He needs to nail down the case that the good times we're all enjoying can be attributed to the Clinton-Gore administration."
SCOFFING at the notion that Mr. Gore should be dwelling on his tenure in the White House, William Daley, the Gore campaign chairman, said: "He'd be murdered by you all if he was trying to take credit for all he's done in the last eight years. People want to hear what you're going to do as president. They don't want to walk down Memory Lane."
Memories may be the single biggest reason Mr. Gore refuses to embrace his vice presidency -- but those memories are of President Clinton. The belief among many Gore advisers is that the president's transgressions have so soiled the White House that recitations of Mr. Gore's accomplishments would immediately be tainted by association, or revive talk of the vice president's own lapses, like his attending a fund-raiser at a Buddhist temple. The one subject Mr. Gore is happy to recall, and may well underscore at the national convention, is his contribution to the longstanding economic boom.
But there is far more at play than Mr. Gore trying to break free from his boss. His advisers say they realize through polling and focus groups that the vice president desperately needs to spruce up his image. "They know Al Gore's been vice president, or they have an impression of stiff and boring," Mr. Daley said. "But here's a guy who's had a full life."
The desire to reintroduce Mr. Gore and play up his human side has been a constant in his campaign, and his career, often to little avail.
If nothing else, campaign advisers say that when Mr. Gore takes center stage, they want voters to remember these facts: He opted to serve in Vietnam at a time when many young men were finding excuses not to. He is passionate about protecting the environment. He stood boldly on his own in the Senate and, over the objections of prominent Democratic leaders, voted for the use of force in the Persian Gulf war. He is such a family man that he thinks nothing of altering his schedule so he can watch his children play lacrosse.
The Gore camp is playing up such biographical snippets to address the central paradox of the Gore candidacy: advisers fear the very skills that make Mr. Gore a successful sidekick -- he is disciplined, dutiful and loyal -- are not the qualities people look for in a president.
The notion is that voters want an engaging leader who is not simply a loyal trooper. They do not think someone deserves the Oval Office simply because he has diligently climbed the rungs of power. "You don't remind people what you were when you're looking for a promotion," said Marla Romash, a longtime adviser to Mr. Gore. "You want to convince them that you're up for the bigger job."
ONLY three times in the last 80 years has a sitting vice president run on his own after eight years in office, and both Mr. Nixon and Mr. Bush had to struggle to get voters to stop thinking of them as junior partners.
In 1960, Vice President Richard Nixon didn't even want the popular president, Dwight Eisenhower, stumping on his behalf, so eager was he to get out of his boss's shadow.
This is the problem that has now fallen to Mr. Gore, who knows full well that for every commercial his campaign runs that features the candidate surrounded by his family or extolling his vision, Republicans intend to portray him just where he does not want to be seen: in service to his country.
"He can not make the eight years vaporize," said Mark McKinnon, Mr. Bush's chief media strategist. "They are there, and he has to live with them."

And Now for Something Completely Different . . .

BYLINE: By LAURIE GOODSTEIN

 BODY:
WHILE Ron Wyden was campaigning for the Senate in Oregon in 1996, a local newspaper ran a letter denouncing him as an "Ashkenazi" -- clearly a code word for Jew. It set off an uproar and some soul-searching in Oregon. How dare a responsible paper publish such anti-Semitism? But what happened next was instructive: the editors apologized, explaining that they had never heard the term and were unaware it could give offense.
Mr. Wyden, whose parents fled Nazi Germany, is now the Democratic senator representing a state in which Jews account for less than 1 percent of the population. Oregon, by the way, is home to not a few militia members and black-helicopter conspiracy buffs. And yet, Mr. Wyden says he encountered only a "small hard core" of haters. 
 The tale of Mr. Wyden bears retelling for those who reacted to the news of Al Gore's selection of Senator Joseph I. Lieberman as a running mate with the queasy suspicion that this just cannot be good for the Jews. Will it awaken the sleeping giant of anti-Semitism, they asked themselves? Will Jews be the scapegoats if the Gore-Lieberman ticket is defeated?
Although bigotry thrives, Jews in this country have never before had so little reason to worry. The reason is that Jews are no longer considered "the other" in America.
As Mr. Wyden found in Oregon, even where Jews are few, acceptance is at an all-time high. Americans typically either see Jews as neighbors or kin, or as objects of fascination, or have no experience with them at all. Paradoxically, the reasons have little to do with television hits like "Seinfeld" and everything to do with the nation's intense Christian faith. Visit the most conservative evangelical church in America today and you will hear from the pulpit mention of "our Judeo-Christian heritage." President Ronald Reagan used the phrase in speeches, and the concept has been thoroughly assimilated by the religious right. Gary Bauer invoked it on the campaign trail.
Mainline Protestants talk of Jews and Christians as "people of the Book," the Old Testament that both faiths share. Pope John Paul II stood in a Roman synagogue and referred to Jews as "our elder brothers," setting a tone for recon ciliation that has reverberated through the Roman Catholic Church.
More than mere tokenism, this language represents a major shift. A broad swath of Christians in this country have begun to recognize, to study and even embrace the Jewish roots of their faith. Most Christians still believe that Jews would be better off accepting Christ, but respect for Jews who do not has grown substantially, scholars say.
"I think there is a growing rapprochement and a sense of commonality," said Max L. Stackhouse, professor of Christian social ethics at Princeton Theological Seminary. "Part of it has to do with the increased encounters with others of the world religions and the new sense of pluralism in this country."
In other words, to the average American Christian who sees Buddhist books on the best-seller list and Hindu temples rising in the suburbs, Jews seem downright familiar.
"Jews are more like us," said Professor Stackhouse, summing up a common attitude among Christians. "We feel greater affinity to those who are Jewish."
Another factor is intermarriage, each wedding vow a chink closing up the old religious divide. The 50 percent intermarriage rate that for 10 years has caused angst among Jews has a flip side: more and more Americans count a Jew in the family tree. When Uncle Michael goes upstairs to read the children a bedtime story, it becomes harder to regard Jews as "the other."
But what really keeps many Jews awake at night is the fear that every new Jewish-sounding surname in the headlines only stokes the widely held conspiracy theories that the world is run by Jews.
Someone who knows the conspiracy thinking well is Paul T. Coughlin, an evangelical Christian who wrote "Secrets, Plots and Hidden Agendas" (InterVarsity Press, 2000), because he was stunned by the amount of conspiratorial talk from callers to his Christian radio show in Oregon.
"There are millions of people who feel that Jews control the economy through what's called the New World Order, and people on the far right argue that this is all dictated in the Book of Revelation where the Apostle John wrote about a world government," he said.
But surprisingly, Mr. Coughlin said, even for a large majority of those believers -- all but the anti-Semitic and racist fringe -- Judaism is "not an issue."
WHY? They believe that membership in the New World Order is determined "more by ideology than heritage," he said. "It's actually liberal elitists, the media, people in universities, who are going to control the New World Order."
Although liberal Jews are suspects, Senator Lieberman, as an Orthodox Jew who represents conservative family values, is not, Mr. Coughlin said. The senator may convince the conspiracy thinkers that "Jewish" and "liberal" are not synonymous, he said. He adds that many of these same Christian conspiracy thinkers actually venerate Jews because the Bible talks of God's covenant with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. "It is actually beneficial for Lieberman to be Jewish," he said.
This is not to claim that anti-Semitism has been eradicated, like smallpox. It lives on, mutates, makes people sick. Mr. Wyden says he received a heap of hate mail when, in a memorable moment broadcast on television, he asked a lineup of tobacco executives at a Congressional hearing whether nicotine is addictive. The anti-Semitic letters came mostly from those in tobacco-growing country, accusing him of destroying their livelihoods, but were filled with "religious animus," he said.
In the Midwest, the Rev. David Ostendorf, executive director of the Center for New Community in Chicago, said: "We did a seminar a few months ago with five or six Chicago high schools, and when we asked how many of you have seen racist symbols like swastikas in your neighborhoods, 90 percent of the kids raised their hands. It kind of jarred us."
The selection of Senator Lieberman is likely to uncap a geyser of ugly extremism. Already, Internet message boards have been swamped with anti-Semitic postings. The head of the local chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in Dallas rambled on about greedy Jews on a talk show.
The response was telling. Scores of people posted Internet messages expressing their disgust at anti-Semitism. The N.A.A.C.P. official was immediately dismissed.
"You have your crazies," said Jerome A. Chanes, the editor of "Anti-Semitism in America Today: Exploding the Myths" (Carol Publishing, 1995). "But in the year 2000, whatever anti-Semitism does exist does not compromise the ability of any Jew to participate in the workings of society at any level."
Gallup polls show that 92 percent of Americans say they would vote for a qualified Jew for president, up from 62 percent in 1958. Other polls that ask the question differently show similar results. Even if twice as many people are lying -- and respondents to polls gauging tolerance often do -- that is still a huge approval rating, Mr. Chanes said. The polls indicate that it is far worse to be a Mormon or an atheist running for office than a Jew.
So why do polls also show that Jews see anti-Semitism as a serious problem in this country, and one likely to worsen? There is a generational divide, said Spencer Blakeslee, author of "The Death of American Anti-Semitism" (Praeger), between older, immigrant Jews who experienced the most vicious anti-Semitism and "the post-World War II generation," for whom the Holocaust is history.
A HEADLINE in last week's New York Observer rendered the divided response to the Lieberman candidacy partly in Yiddish: "Alter Kockers Shaking, Pishers Are Thrilled."
"We have a lot of Jews walking around who are frightened at things they need not be frightened about," said Mr. Blakeslee, a sociologist at Framingham State College in Massachusetts. "When in the world are Jews going to learn to take yes for an answer?"
Mr. Wyden said that for him the challenge is "not overt anti-Semitism or prejudice, but that there may be a significant number of people who have had little or no contact with Jews, aren't familiar with the Holocaust and so much of the history that Jews are sensitive to."
Mr. Wyden says he considers any campaign for a Jewish candidate to be "a terrific opportunity, because the slate is clean."

The Art of the Grand Old Cinemas, the Science of the New

BYLINE: By MONTE WILLIAMS

 BODY:
MARCUS LOEW, who founded Loews Theaters in the early 1900's, once said: "We sell tickets to theaters, not movies." That was certainly the case when the grand movie palaces of the teens, 20's and 30's lit up America.
For the most part, the theaters were showy grandes dames. They flaunted crystal chandeliers, marble floors and architectural ornamentation worthy of the Sun King. The Loews Paradise in Fordham in the Bronx was beyond rococo, festooned with statues, elaborate archways and intricate frescoes. 
 By the 40's, the golden age of movie palaces was falling into a decline that, in the 70's, the mall-driven rise of the multiplex began to counter, only for it to be clobbered again by the VCR craze.
But in the last few years, a new grandiosity has arrived, inflating cinemas into Brobdingnagian multiplexes that house as many as 30 screens, the theaters competing with their film selections in terms of theatricality.
AMC, the national movie chain formerly known as American Multi-Cinema, has built 11 30-screen theaters in six cities, including Los Angeles, Chicago, Phoenix, Detroit, Dallas and Houston. On West 42nd Street in Manhattan, it has erected the AMC Empire 25, which, as its name suggests, has a mere 25 screens. There are also four roof decks -- a sublime amenity for stargazers, sun addicts and smokers. Those who want an unencumbered view of Manhattan's skyline can choose to look from outdoors or indoors, thanks to vast banks of windows. At one of six concession stands, there is cafe seating and several television monitors, which show coming attractions as well as interviews with luminaries on Cable News Network. There is also a V.I.P. room for celebrities who don't want to mingle with hoi polloi.
Across the street is a Loews, with a ceiling fresco in the lobby and wall murals meant to hark back to the likes of the Paradise. This cinematic emporium has 13 screens, TV sets at the concession stands and, like AMC, several talking machines where moviegoers can purchase tickets. It also has a restaurant that supplies the concession stands with more than the usual movie fare, reflecting the fact that more profits are made there than on ticket sales. On the menu are mini mozzarella sticks ($5.99), chicken quesadillas ($5.99), potato skins ($6.99) and popcorn shrimp ($7.99).
Theater owners pin this bigger-is-better, more-is-more ethos squarely on the synergy of the booming economy and changing demographics.
"Times are good," said Rick King, a spokesman for AMC. "People have more disposable income." And those people, he said, include baby boomers who have become empty nesters, and big-spending teenagers and young adults, who are savvy and demanding.
"Today's teenager and young adult movie-goers have higher expectations in a technical sense," Mr. King said, "for sound and picture quality."
The cinemas reflect the shift. "We've returned our attention to film presentation and showmanship in our buildings," said Marc Pascucci, a spokesman for Loews. "The consumer is a lot more savvy about the presentation. Entertainment has become news."
Consequently, every possible technological advance is being incorporated: digital sound, bigger screens and stadium seating, where everyone is on a riser.
"So what happens is, the moviegoing experience is more powerful and more consuming," Mr. Pascucci said. "What we've found is that instead of going to an ordinary theater in the neighborhood, people will go to a theater one or more miles away if it's splashier."
But for all that focus, the new grandiosity holds little resemblance to the old. What technology gives now, atmosphere offered then.
Stewart Jones, a senior associate at Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer Associates, a Manhattan-based architectural firm, said the old movie palaces, with their mixing of Baroque, Italian Renaissance, Classical and Moorish themes, were meant for fantasy.
"You were going to a different period of time," he said. "They were taking you to a different place. You were transported."
"Today's analogy," he said, "is: buy a plane ticket, go down to Disney World and end up in the Magic Kingdom. It's the wonderful world of movies."
THE megaplexing trend appears to be going as global as the taste for American movies. Loews, which has 245 movie locations in 22 Americancities, also has cinemas in Canada, Spain, Hungary and Turkey. And it has plans to build in Italy and Vietnam.
It's a good bet the new style in megamultiplexing will last as long as the economy rides high -- or until some unforeseen social development steals its audience. The grand old movie palaces -- all set in urban centers -- died out less from the Depression than from housing patterns that sucked city populations into new suburbs after World War II, according to Toby Miller, a professor of cinema studies at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts.
"The televisualization and suburbanization of American homes denuded the inner city of its population," he said. Modest cinemas became the norm.
And there's another area of vulnerability. Bigger is only better until it isn't. Years ago, there was a monopoly-busting Justice Department decree that forced major movie studios, which used to control distribution, production and exhibition, to sell off the theaters.
At AMC Empire 25 last week, the backlash against big was more personal. Yoland Trevino, who is from Los Angeles, said she felt like "a rat in a maze" trying to find a bathroom.
"There are no signs visible from here," she said, looking around in the lobby. "It's like sensory overload. I'm overwhelmed."

HEADLINE: Show Time for Al Gore

 BODY:
In political analysis, the conventional question to ask at this point in the electoral calendar is this: What does a presidential candidate need to get from his party's national convention? Past candidates have used conventions to show they are strong enough, wise enough or steady enough to lead the nation. But it is hard to think of an exact precedent for the problem confronting Al Gore as he prepares to accept the Democratic nomination.
He will arrive in Los Angeles on Tuesday as a career politician who clearly outmatches his opponent in governing experience, depth of knowledge and empathy for those Americans most in need of a government that is both competent and caring. Yet the most fundamental task of elective politics -- connecting with people and making them like him -- seems to elude Mr. Gore. Perhaps it can best be summed up by calling it his authenticity problem. Voters understand that Mr. Gore is smart. But they also see his seeming inability to make the theatrical part of politics feel like a genuine civic and patriotic experience. They know he is a good protege, but wonder if he has a controlling inner authority. 
 These doubts, plus the disciplined if deceptive salesmanship of Gov. George W. Bush, have combined to produce months of erosion for Mr. Gore. He has seen slippage in the polls, in the level of cooperation between his campaign and the White House, and in his confidence on the stump. If he is going to win the office to which he has aspired since boyhood, Albert Arnold Gore Jr. needs to have a very good convention on several fronts.
The Clinton Problem. In order to create shooting space, a basketball player has to "get separation" from the nearest defensive player. Mr. Gore has to achieve a separation from President Clinton's conduct and personal reputation in ways that go beyond simply failing whenever possible to mention his name. Mr. Bush and the Republicans believe that words like "character," "integrity" and "dignity" are guided missiles that fly straight into the Democratic bunker. Since defending the president against such attacks is politically impossible, Mr. Gore has to create alternative definitions for himself and his party on the issues of presidential decorum and clean campaign money.
He signaled his desire to do so by putting Senator Joseph Lieberman on the ticket, but having a devout running mate is not enough. The real trick will be using Mr. Lieberman to promote policies that are distinctively superior to Mr. Bush's in the areas of campaign finance and opposition to special interests. Mr. Gore promised last spring to make campaign finance reform his No. 1 domestic priority. Senator Lieberman, having a cleaner history, can elevate that promise into a major attack weapon against a Republican ticket that is expected to raise more than $200 million in soft money from corporations and wealthy individuals. Proper use of this issue could help the Democrats pull the John McCain independents away from the Bush-Cheney ticket.
If he could curb his desire for attention, Mr. Clinton could help Mr. Gore achieve the aura of independence. That means giving a convention speech that depicts Mr. Gore as something other than a vessel for the Clinton legacy. In 1988, President Reagan helped George Bush overcome the wimp factor by hailing him as "someone who's big enough and experienced enough" for the job. If Mr. Clinton is not truly ready for Mr. Gore to have his turn, his inner grump will be visible lurking behind whatever oratorical scrim he erects. The president, in sum, must convince America that he believes Mr. Gore has virtues beyond being more similar to Bill Clinton than George Bush is.
A Crisp Agenda. Anyone who paid even marginal attention to the Republican convention came away with a clear idea of what Mr. Bush plans to do if elected. He will spend most of the surplus on tax cuts. He will strengthen the military and emphasize a new missile defense system. He will build a private-investment component into Social Security and take unspecified steps to improve education.
Mr. Gore needs to leave an equally crisp paragraph in the heads of the voters after his convention. Senator Charles Schumer is right that Mr. Gore's paragraph has to be written around the concept of prosperity, forcing voters to acknowledge that American families are better off than they were under Mr. Bush's father or Mr. Reagan.
Voters should know after Los Angeles that Mr. Gore would not risk Reagan-style deficits by spending the surplus on tax cuts. He would use it to secure Social Security and Medicare. He would aim some revenues at improving education and the environment. He would guarantee a Supreme Court that would not overturn the right to abortion. He would free the American political system from the corrupting influence of corporate money.
Finally, in a personal declaration of independence, he should promise to provide a standard of White House behavior that would not require either public lying or public confessions by the chief executive.
Performance. As a member of the rock 'n' roll generation, Mr. Gore no doubt remembers the Big Bopper's tribute to being "real loose like a long-necked goose." But the plain fact is, if the man could loosen up he would already have done it. Moreover, he will come to the lectern in Los Angeles trailing many unfortunate sound bites. His early waffling on gun control and abortion financing, his exaggerations about Mr. Clinton's place in history and his evasions about White House fund-raising all cast doubt on the steadiness of his convictions and identity. More than anything, Al Gore needs to use his convention to address those concerns, and he can do so through both style and substance.
On the stylistic side, no one doubts that Mr. Gore is the best demolition orator in American politics. He will, if he chooses, demolish Mr. Bush's budget arithmetic as thoroughly as he dismantled Bill Bradley's health plan. The problem is that Americans do not really prefer a counterpuncher as their first choice for president. Further, it is a quirk of Mr. Gore's speaking style that the more right he is, the more he irritates people. In this speech, as in no other of his life, he needs to avoid pummeling Americans with his book learning and talk instead about what he believes. For if you hack through the sound-bite detritus of a 24-year electoral career, it is possible to find the theme of a conviction that animates the vice president.
He does want a government that is caring and active without being intrusive or controlling. In speech after speech he has returned to his desire to be the protector of working families. Mr. Bush has grafted onto his classic corporate Republican politics the view that government ought to be something other than an impassive referee that watches while the economy sorts out the losers and winners. But that benign vision does not have to be grafted onto Mr. Gore's politics. It is root and branch of his philosophy, the healthier part of his inheritance from Albert Gore Sr. and Mr. Clinton.
In the weeks and months ahead, Mr. Gore's political fate will be determined by his ability to convey that conviction without shouting, waving his arms or relentlessly flailing his opponent and the public with yet another bunch of impeccably bundled facts. In the end, when choosing between the guy with the smirk and the smartest boy in the class, the voters will go for the man who seems anchored from within by some core of incorruptible belief.

Ticket Too High? Call It Therapy

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY 

 BODY:
PAID $37 to park my car in Manhattan the other night. Was there only three hours, but should have left the car to rationalize the overnight fee.
"You dope," some people are saying. "It's your own fault for driving in Manhattan. You get what you deserve in life." 
True, but normally I jockey into spaces on the street and only in desperation do I go for a garage. When did parking soar from $20 to $37 on Amsterdam and 75th?
A price like that can make you feel you don't belong in your own city anymore. Yet the garage was full, and the restaurants were busy on a Wednesday night, and up at Yankee Stadium, there was a crowd of 33,466 paying customers. Who can afford these pleasures?
"Merchants are hiking prices because they recognize that these days many New Yorkers have more disposable income," notes Peter F. Vallone, the speaker of the New York City Council.
"But the truth is, too many New Yorkers can't afford to have a good time," Vallone said.
Not if a good time is defined as a casual night at the arena. In the age of the $37 parking fee, the dreadfully selfish athletes are up to nine-digit salaries, spread over a few years. This forces the wonderfully benevolent owners to raise ticket prices -- as gently as possible, of course.
Vallone claims that sports tickets have risen faster than any other form of entertainment in the past five years, and backs it up with numbers.
The Knicks' highest ticket -- not including season ticket plans -- has risen from $45 to $220 since 1995, which, adjusted for inflation, amounts to a leap of 335.21 percent.
"Who in the world can afford that?" Vallone said. "The fans are the ones who made the Knicks, but now they can't see the Knicks in person."
Depends on your definition of fan. Somebody must be able to afford to watch the Knicks, since they have sold out Madison Square Garden for 347 straight games, since John Starks was a lad.
"A lot of these are corporate seats," Vallone said. "You have a wealthy class of people who buy these tickets for business purposes. There's nothing left for the middle class. The taxi driver can't buy four seats to the Knicks."
These populist sentiments from Vallone, a Democrat from Queens, just might have something to do with his mayoral aspirations. He made his original comments directly in front of the Garden, which, as you might imagine, has its corporate response.
"Winning teams and top-rated productions are very expensive to produce," said the Garden's president, Dave Checketts, in a statement.
The Garden is not the only sports outfit to raise prices. Yankees bleacher seats have jumped only 18.69 percent since 1995 while their highest tickets have jumped 110.19 percent. The Mets' lowest tickets have jumped 64.38 percent and their highest have gone up 119.58 percent.
At the United States Open, prices have risen only 1.29 percent for the cheaper tickets in the first week. The modest rise can be explained by these seats being in the lunar reaches of Ashe Stadium, so remote that ticket-holders abandon them to actually see a tennis match.
At the Open, the more expensive seats have jumped 127.31 percent, below the ghost town of the luxury boxes. (All these percentages were adjusted for inflation.)
Meanwhile, the Staten Island Ferry has gone from 50 cents to free -- "the best deal in town," Vallone called it -- seagulls and salt spray instead of the cacophonous drivel of the Garden.
Vallone has an apocalyptic vision in which the average fan will lose visceral contact with the players, and the passion for sport will die. He wishes the office of council speaker, or the mayor, had more muscle, but he said that when he complains of gouging in other areas, "the heads of banks come to my office." The line forms on the right for team owners willing to be scolded by the speaker.
For all the gouging, the evidence is that people still feel connected with their teams. A fascinating article by James C. McKinley Jr. in Friday's New York Times suggests that fans may actually be healthier and happier than people with no sporting affiliation.
In other words, fretting over Patrick Ewing's court vision has the same function as caring for a fuzzy pet -- therapy at $220 a pop.
The temptation is to tell fans to get over it, that it's just a game, but psychologists say that male and female fans undergo hormonal surges based on the wayward roll of a ball.
For example: when poor old Franco Baresi and Roberto Baggio both missed penalty kicks to decide the scoreless tie in the 1994 World Cup final between Italy and Brazil, the measurable testosterone level in a small sample of Brazilian men went up by 28 percent while the level in a sample of Italian men went down by 27 percent. (There's plenty to spare, but still -- 27 percent?)
So remember: when you see Florida fans lurching away in their Winnebagos after a bad autumn afternoon at Florida State, or Red Sox fans dying yet another death in Fenway Park, think of the downward spiral of testosterone level, matched only by the upward spiral of ticket prices -- going together like a masochist's dream.

HEADLINE: An Influx Of Tourists To Far North Of Canada

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: YELLOWKNIFE, Northwest Territories

 BODY:
With tee-off times set for midnight, the summer solstice golf tournament was fast approaching when Rebecca Jaud faced an increasingly familiar problem for this Arctic city: no rooms at the inns.
"I was calling bed and breakfast operators to see if they could loan camping equipment so tourists could sleep in their backyards," said Ms. Jaud, who runs this city's increasingly busy visitors center. 
 Yellowknife, on the northern tip of the Great Slave Lake, has traditionally been the Saturday night destination of choice for fur trappers, gold miners and lonely Mounties.
But as evidenced by two new hotels nearing completion here, a new sushi restaurant with Japanese-speaking staff, and travel advertisements fattening Up Here magazine, Yellowknife and Canada's north are undergoing a tourism boom.
"We are just crazy with Europeans," Darielle Talarico, manager of Go Wild Tours, said in Inuvik, a town above the Arctic Circle, as she prepared to send another group of visitors down the Dempster Highway to Whitehorse, 1,000 miles to the south. This summer, weekly flights link Zurich and Frankfurt with Whitehorse, capital of the Yukon Territory, where tourism has become the No. 1 economic activity.
Although Germans flood the Yukon, French flock to Nunavut and 10,000 Japanese tourists come to Yellowknife every winter to view the northern lights, Canada's northern tourism boom is largely fueled by Americans, who account for about three-quarters of the nation's foreign visitors every year.
Much as affluent Americans migrate south in the winter to escape the cold, more now migrate north in the summer to escape the heat.
In a reversal in 1998, more Americans made overnight trips to Canada than Canadians made overnight trips to the United States. With northern tourism growing faster than southern tourism, American overnight trips to Canada increased by 24 percent in the 1990's, hitting 15.2 million last year, while American trips to Mexico grew by 14 percent during the decade, hitting 18.3 million last year.
Many Americans are lured by the Canadian dollar, which lingers near historically low levels. But while they may find good prices on their summer trip, they still find that coming north does not necessarily mean an escape from global warming. In mid-July, air-conditioners were going full blast in this city, 275 miles south of the Arctic Circle.
"In Edmonton it was so hot we had to put things under the kickstands so the bikes wouldn't sink into the asphalt," said Lloyd Schaffer, a retired computer systems analyst who motorcycled here from Waterloo, Iowa, with a friend. "We love Canada. The people are so friendly. The prices are good up here."
Canada's three northern territories, home to only 100,000 people sprinkled across 1.5 million square miles, have traditionally been seen as a preserve of the Indiana Jones adventure traveler.
Now, with good hotels in every major town and increasingly reliable, if expensive, air links, it is often older and more affluent tourists who can be found here.
"I loved it so much that we are going next year on a Russian icebreaker, from Churchill in the Hudson Bay to Greenland," said Sam Wagonfeld, a retired Denver child psychologist, after spending a week in July touring Eskimo villages and archaeological sites with his wife, Sally Allen. The five members of the tour group, who flew around Nunavut, Canada's new eastern Arctic territory, were all in their 60's.
In Yellowknife, arriving visitors often say they are surprised by the amenities offered by this territorial capital of 18,000 people.
Harry Symington, who moved here from Hong Kong to manage the Explorer, the city's largest hotel, said, "People say: 'You've got a city here, high-rise buildings. We thought you would be living out of trailers.' "

HEADLINE: Exiled Laotian Prince Seeks a New Role

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

 BODY:
Nearly 20 years ago, an 18-year-old prince, heir to a doomed Asian royal line, commandeered a small boat and sailed unnoticed with his brother and their nanny across the Mekong River from Laos to Thailand. Laos had become a Communist nation, in the orbit of neighboring Vietnam, and the prince, Soulivong Savang, feared being co-opted or killed.
Two decades later, the prince -- grandson of the last king of Laos, who died mysteriously in Communist captivity with the prince's father and other relatives -- is beginning to reassert his claim of leadership. 
 The return of a monarchy, even a constitutional monarchy, to Laos is at best a remote possibility. Royal families continue to play a role in Asia, from the Himalayas through Southeast Asia to Japan, but Prince Soulivong Savang is not focused on those examples.
In an interview in New York on a recent visit to Laotian exile communities in the United States, the prince, now 37, said that after years of a European education in law and political science, he has found a new hero in King Juan Carlos of Spain, a champion of democracy in a country that emerged from a long dictatorship.
"I'm not so interested in the future of monarchy in Laos," he said, speaking in Lao through an aide who interpreted. "My main proposal is to restore democracy first. The restoration of the monarchy would be up to the Lao people."
He is taking that message to Laotians exiled in the West at a time of unexpected new unrest in Laos, a country of barely five million people. In recent months, bombings in the capital and other towns, coupled with an apparently reinvigorated rebellion among the Hmong people in the north, has shaken the last largely unreconstructed Communist government of Southeast Asia.
Prince Soulivong Savang treads carefully in talking of the Vietnamese, who had hoped to keep Laos and Cambodia within an Indochinese federation dominated by Hanoi. The federation was a legacy of French colonialism, which ended in the mid-1950's. The French also promoted the modern Laotian monarchy. As its heir, the prince is portrayed in Laos as a client of the West.
The crown prince, who lives in Paris, has been following reports of student unrest and a surreptitious return of the Vietnamese military to Laos. He is also concerned about the domination of Thai business on the fragile economy of Laos.
With an end to Communism, Vietnamese and Thai influence would be gone from Laos, said his uncle, Prince Sauryavong Savang, who escaped death because he was in Thailand when the sweep of the royal family took place in 1977. The elder prince regent also lives in Paris. The Laotian government has never said exactly what happened to the rest of the royal family, except to announce in 1989 that King Savang Vatthana was dead.
Prince Soulivong Savang said that he was away at school in 1977, when his grandfather, father and six other family members were arrested. He was allowed to remain with his mother, Princess Manilay Khampane Panya, in the royal capital, Luang Phabang, though under constant surveillance.
The government arranged his secondary education, which included large doses of Communist doctrine. A cousin of the late king, Prince Souphanouvong, had become a Marxist, so there was a precedent. Because the young prince's family had been stripped of their money and possessions, he learned to grow rice to feed them, he said.
Within a few years, he said, his friends began disappearing from school. "When they stayed loyal to the monarchy they would be taken away for re-education," he said. "Later I realized that the government was trying to prevent a group of supporters growing around me because by the age of 18, I had become a symbol and a danger. I heard a rumor that I would be sent to a Communist country for further education. I was obliged to find a way to escape."
The prince said that he faked allergies that he said needed urgent treatment by a doctor in Vientiane, now the Laotian capital. Before his minders could see what was happening, he had fled from there across the Mekong to Nong Khai, a Thai river port.
In Thailand, he and his brother were protected by the Thai royal family until it was considered safe to arrange the prince's travel to France. His mother is still alive in Laos, he said. They met last year in Australia, where the Lao government had allowed her a visit when her daughter, the prince's sister, had a baby.
Prince Soulivong Savang is learning English in London in the hope of reaching a wider audience of Lao exiles. Never married, he said he is willing to put his life into his cause, and his followers in the United States are pressing his case as part of a broader democracy movement seeking support from Congress.
The Laotian exile community -- 100,000 in France, 40,000 in Australia and half a million in the United States -- has been fractured ethnically between Lao and Hmong. The crown prince said he tells both groups that a constitutional monarchy is their best hope of unity.

HEADLINE: OLYMPICS: 82 Pounds of Steel;
Girded by Past Struggles, Loroupe Runs for Kenyan Gold

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN 

 BODY:
Seven times Africans have won the Olympic marathon, but they have been a barefoot Ethiopian running through the torchlit night in Rome, and a South African miner racing into daylight after the darkness of apartheid. An Ethiopian woman has won, too, cheered on by expatriate taxi drivers in Atlanta, dropping to her knees at the finish line and kissing the track.
For Kenya, there has been nothing more substantial than one silver medal and one bronze. How could that be? It seems astonishing, considering that the Kenyans run with such graceful domination in Boston and New York and everywhere on the roads, bunching and surging in packs, such elegant wolves. 
 Now, however, Kenya is favored to win its first Olympic marathon at the Games in Sydney, Australia, next month. But the race comes with a cultural twist. In a highly patriarchal society where women play a subservient role, it is a woman, Tegla Loroupe, who is expected to achieve Kenya's first gold medal in the marathon at the Summer Games. She appears fragile at 4 feet 11 inches and 82 pounds, yet she is an insistent wraith, holding the world record of 2 hours 20 minutes 43 seconds and refusing to succumb to the pressures of her country and her father to live a chattel life of domestic servitude.
Even if she wins the 26.2-mile women's marathon on Sept. 24, Loroupe will not be satisfied.
Three days later, in what will require extraordinary endurance, she intends to run the preliminary round of the 10,000 meters, a distance of 6.2 miles, at which she finished sixth at the 1996 Atlanta Games.
"Kenya has never had a woman win a gold medal at the Olympics, so it would be great to be the first," Loroupe, 27, said in a recent interview in New York. "It will be a payback for all of the struggles I went through."
The struggles continue, even now. In late July, when she returned to participate in the Kenyan Olympic trials, track officials inscrutably entered Loroupe in the 1,500 meters, the metric mile, a distance for which she has neither the foot speed nor the desire to run. Like many Kenyan runners, she has had frequent clashes with the national track and field federation. She refused to run the 1,500, telling organizers that she would enter the 10,000 meters even if she had to compete without a number signifying an official entry.
They relented. She ran the 10,000 meters. She finished first.
 
A Childhood of Pain
To demonstrate her own willfulness, Loroupe tells a troubling story of how she nearly committed infanticide as a young girl in the western Kenyan village of Kapsait. She does not remember the incident, but said she had been told of it by her mother, Mary Lotuma. The story has been confirmed by Anne Roberts, who recruits the top runners yearly for the New York City Marathon, which Loroupe has won twice. The two are so close that Loroupe calls Roberts "Mom."
When Tegla was not yet 3, she said, her mother gave birth in the fields of the family farm to a brother named Philip and returned home still bleeding from the delivery. Apparently associating the newborn with her mother's pain and suffering, Tegla said she grabbed the baby and began dragging it toward a fire in the house.
"If he wasn't there, my mother wouldn't be hurt anymore," she said.
Her mother intervened, slapping Tegla so hard that she nearly lost consciousness and sending her to live with an aunt until she was 7. Her aunt had her own children, and Tegla was put in charge of caring for an infant, even though she was a child herself. She had little to wear, she said, and her relatives refused to buy her clothes or send her to school. Eventually, she could stand it no longer. One day, she took off and ran several miles back to her mother's house, so desperate to get away that she crossed a small stream, frightened because she could not swim.
Tegla had also been born in a maize field, her mother going into labor as she worked the land. When she was young, Loroupe said, she had experienced respiratory problems, and her mother once walked with her an entire day to the nearest hospital. By the time Tegla was 5, she was hauling water and firewood and infant children on her back. It is this ability to withstand great hardship, Loroupe believes, that makes athletes from developing nations into the best distance runners. Her own mother, she said, once told her: "You'll be the best. You can take the pain."
"It is difficult for me to believe how strong I am," Loroupe said. "I worked so hard when I was young. Running is just a minor thing to me, compared with what I was doing with my family. I carried a lot of water and firewood. I had a lot of strain on my shoulders."
Her father, Loroupe Losiwa, did not want her to attend school. Or to run. He believed his daughter should live a traditional, servile life, working in the fields, getting married at 18, having children. It was her mother and her eldest sister, Albina, who pushed her to get an education. Her mother had been an orphan and taught her the value of independence. Her sister told her that if she owned things of her own, men would not own her.
"My father thought I would be spoiled by school," Loroupe said. "He was fearing that I would go out of the family and get pregnant and no one would take care of me. But my mother had a tough life and she didn't want that for her children."
 
Talent That Couldn't Be Hidden
She is a distance runner, but her words come forward in short bursts. Her speech is as forceful as her running.
When she first came to New York, to run a 10-kilometer race in Central Park in 1993, a bicyclist was obstructing her path, so she shoved the bicycle aside to get to the front.
"Women are the workhorses in Kenyan culture," Loroupe said. "They carry the country on their backs. Because of polygamy, they are left alone to raise their children. It was a terrible hardship for my mother. She said to me: 'I wanted to leave. There was much pain. I thought about it and then I realized that no one would take care of my children, so I stayed.' She was determined that her children would have a better life. My mother told me to go to school. I always wanted to do something better than the others."
In elementary school, Roberts said, Tegla persuaded her father to let her run if she got better math grades than her brother Philip. "It was a safe bet," Roberts said. "Tegla knew she was smarter than her brother but her father didn't."
When, at 12, Loroupe was sent to boarding school in the nearest town, Kapenguria, her father demanded that she stop running. If allowed to continue school, she would have to concentrate on her studies. For six months, she listened, then another student gave her away. Tegla was an accomplished runner, one girl told school officials. Her secret was out.
The school gave her a choice, Loroupe said. She would have to run. If she did not cooperate, she would be forced to circle the school track on her knees as punishment. She had no running clothes, no running shoes, just her blouse and skirt, but she ran anyway, even if she disobeyed her father's wishes. "Nobody caught me," she said. "My teacher said, 'She has a big mouth, but she is a very good runner.' "
She became a national high school champion at the middle distances and in cross country, took college accounting classes and became an auditor for the Kenyan postal service. In the fall of 1994, Loroupe won the New York City Marathon, running so patiently and stealthily that the other contenders never saw her take the lead. She was the first African woman to win a major marathon. When she returned home to her village, she received gifts of livestock and land and the now familiar welcome from women in her Pokot ethnic group who told her: "You showed that we are like the men -- we can do things. We are not useless."
A year later, she won in New York again.
"She has been very important to me," said Catherine Ndereba, a Kenyan who won the 2000 Boston Marathon. "When I started running in 1994, I learned about her in magazines. I knew she was a star in our country and I was copying her."
On Sept. 26, 1999, Loroupe set the marathon world record in Berlin. A limited-issue postage stamp has been released bearing her likeness. At the recent Kenyan trials, Roberts said, Loroupe was granted an audience with the country's longtime president, Daniel arap Moi.
 
Winning Father's Approval
The sentimental thing is to believe that her achievements have filled the sails of all Kenyan women. More accurately, she has been merely a brilliant gust, welcoming, but only temporarily relieving. Women in Kenya still suffer harsh economic privation, educational disparity, job discrimination. Only 9 of the 224 members of Parliament are women, said the country's most prominent female politician, Charity Ngilu, who in 1997 became the first woman to run for president.
"We are very proud of Tegla, but until we get more women in positions of decision making, we are not going to make an impact," Ngilu said in a telephone interview from Nairobi. "When I ran for the presidency, I was known through the media in Europe and America much more than in my own country. I think it is the same with Tegla."
Loroupe owns land and houses in Kenya, but she spends only a month or two at home each year, training instead in Germany with her longtime coach and manager, Volker Wagner.
Parasites in the food and water in Kenya worry her. So does the rising crime rate. Last April, just before she won the London Marathon, Loroupe had 20 head of cattle stolen from Kapsait.
Rustling is often done with guns now, and her mother and her older brother, Julius, were shot at as they pursued the livestock on a 100-mile trek to the Ugandan border, Loroupe said. Eventually, she said, a Ugandan minister who was also an ethnic Pokot had the cattle rounded up and returned.
There is another reason not to spend more time in Kenya. She is a professional athlete, but when she goes home Loroupe is expected to resume old chores, hauling wood and water.
"No one is an idol," she said.
She can earn more than $1 million a year from running, an astounding figure in such a poor country, but her personal responsibilities are immense.
Her sister Albina died of a mysterious ailment in 1995, and Tegla is putting Albina's six children through school. She is also paying expenses for two of her sisters who attend college in the United States, and she tries to aid young Kenyan girls with running camps and equipment. This is what Loroupe thinks she might do when she retires, something for women in sports.
"She has an enormous emotional burden for someone so young," Roberts said. "It worries me sometimes."
There are no guarantees at the Olympics. The marathon is a women's only race, and Loroupe has run her best in the company of men, who can pace her and protect her from the wind.
The course in Sydney is also hilly, and hills have sometimes pounded her quadriceps muscles.
Loroupe has also had problems with her hips, and during the London Marathon in April her left leg went numb for nearly half the race.
Already, though, she has won something nearly as prized as a gold medal -- the grudging respect and approval of her father. During the spring, he apologized for his earlier interference, she said.
"He told me he was sorry that he did not congratulate me," Loroupe said. "I blazed my own trail. He said he was sorry that he might have spoiled my career. He knew all that I went through. He said I was brave."

Elks (the Clubs) Becoming Extinct

BYLINE: By CHARLIE LeDUFF

 BODY:
There is a building in central Queens that is a temple to the working man. It is a fading neo-classical castle of brick and plaster. It is five stories high and one floor down, and the American flag that flies above it is the only American flag that can be seen clearly on Queens Boulevard for a mile in either direction.
It is Lodge No. 878 of the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks. To be a member you must be a United States citizen and a man over the age of 21 who believes in God. The cornerstone was laid in 1923 and the place was built for $750,000, an astronomical amount at the time. There is a hollow bronze elk on a pedestal in front of the entrance. 
 The place is dying from the inside out.
The interior has those old municipal smells, like those in the public library or the marriage license bureau. There is no sign of life. A ringing telephone goes unanswered. There is a sign near the stairs prohibiting women and non-Elks from climbing further. On the mezzanine is a sturdy oak door, where an East Indian woman answers the knock. She is a secretary for the New Life Fellowship Church. "God willing, we will own this place soon," she said.
At the end of the week, the Elks Club comes to life. A big screen carries a simulcast from the Belmont Park, and a dozen men hang around the first-floor bar waiting for their horses to come in. Most of them are the older crowd: white, retired teamsters, construction workers and such. They say things like, "It's been a while since I been in this jurnt" and "Lemme get a sodie pop" and "Don't be a wise guy, Sammy."
As it is at most men's clubs across the country, the sun is setting on Lodge 878. The building is for sale because the club can't make the $60,000 tax bill. The New Life Fellowship Church, which has been renting the mezzanine for four years, plans to purchase the lodge by the end of December for around $10 million. One of the sticking points in the deal is that the Elks would like to retain control of the first floor -- rent free -- for 99 years.
"The whole world's changed," said Patrick Pendergrass, 66, the treasurer of the club and the man who phones the bets to the Off-Track Betting office. "Clubs like this are folding all over the place. It's a piece of America that's dying. We'd like to stay here."
Once, everybody who was somebody and everybody who wanted to be somebody belonged to the club. There were congressmen, district attorneys, local political bosses. The club once had 6,600 members (now there are about 600). If you wanted a job in 1960's Queens, you came to the Elks. There was the Elks Bazaar, the borough's social event of the year. There was the raffle of two dozen Cadillacs. There were the eight bowling alleys -- with automatic pin setters -- in the basement. There were the three bars. There were the drinks and dancing and deals made under the stained-glass skylight. There was the charitable work.
Now there are Fridays and the 20 rundown men who board in the rooms on the top floor. They wear robes and spend the day watching television.
Here's what you're likely to hear at the bar on a Friday afternoon: Maybe things are better for the working man, maybe they're not; it's just that they don't seem better. The wife has to work now, no more coming home for your dinner and then off to the club. The neighborhood has changed. The houses are overflowing with third-world immigrants. The club is dying. They say the economy is better. They say the Wall Street money is finally trickling down, that wages are trickling up. But so is inflation. So are taxes.
"It's not my America anymore," said Charlie Novak, 58, a construction worker and a veteran. "The American kids aren't interested in community anymore. And then again the community is third world."
The statistics agree with Mr. Novak. Fraternal organizations are drying up all around the country. Since the end of the Vietnam War the Elks' national membership has dropped more than 15 percent, despite opening the club to women five years ago. The Shriners have shrunk from a million members to half a million since 1980. It's a similar story for the Knights of Columbus, Moose and Masons.
Locally, according to the city's Department of Planning, the population in Elmhurst grew by 16 percent between 1980 and 1990. Public assistance increased by 91 percent between 1990 and 1995. While the number of people living there has increased, the number of whites was 20 percent in 1990, down from 36 percent 10 years earlier. At the same time, Asians have increased to 37 percent of the population, up from 29 percent.
"Funny thing is," said Mr. Pendergrass, "we keep afloat by catering to the third-world clientele. We do a lot of birthday parties and weddings here."
The older guys who live upstairs wander the halls behind clouds of cigarette smoke, staring blankly, appearing somewhat confused at this new crowd.
"They're from another era," said Eddie DeJesus Jr., the administrator of the church. "It's odd isn't it? A church and a fraternal men's organization below. It's so New York. Jesus said love everybody."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE REFORM PARTIES;
Bitter Rivals Leaving Town As They Feud Over Money

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr. and MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: LONG BEACH, Calif., Aug. 12

 BODY:
Battered and sundered into competing factions, the Reform Party fought through the final hours of a bitter national convention today, then limped out of town as two parties, each with its own ideology and nominee.
Both laid claim to the Reform Party name. But other than that, about the only thing they shared was a highly questionable future and the strong likelihood that they would end up in a campaign-crimping court battle this fall over the original party's remains and $12.6 million in federal campaign money. 
 Gone from this raucous four-day affair was the commanding presence of Ross Perot, who founded the Reform Party eight years ago and, with his rapid-fire talk of changing the federal bureaucracy, briefly made it a potent political force. A couple of years ago, when he sensed that the country, grown economically fat and seemingly content, had lost its appetite for him and political reform, he cut his ties to the party.
It came hard aground here in Long Beach this week and broke in two. Try as they might, party officials could not put it back together.
Patrick J. Buchanan, the former Republican presidential contender, took one part.
John Hagelin, a soft-spoken perennial candidate who usually runs under the banner of the Natural Law Party, took the other.
"At long last we have a home of our own," Mr. Buchanan said today after his faction chose him as its nominee. "And this party we are building together is being built to last."
Mr. Hagelin struck a similar note in his acceptance speech. "This is your party," he told his cheering followers. "Breathe strength into it. Grow it into America's next major party."
Beyond that, the two men agreed on nothing except perhaps the need for fair trade. They accused each other of just about every sin under the political sun, especially of trying to steal the party away.
For a running mate, Mr. Buchanan on Friday selected Ezola Foster, a conservative black educator from Los Angeles, while Mr. Hagelin announced this afternoon that his choice was Nat Goldhaber, a multimedia executive and venture capitalist from Berkeley, Calif.
As Mr. Buchanan saw it, when he joined the party last spring it was hardly a party at all. He said his presence would reinvigorate it, dismissing Mr. Hagelin as a political nobody.
In Mr. Hagelin's view, Mr. Buchanan was a brazen opportunist on the down side of a political career seeking merely to further his own conservative social agenda. This agenda is crowded with hot-button issues like abortion, gun control and affirmative action, which Mr. Hagelin argued the party had always avoided.
Both men arrived in Long Beach intent on using the dispirited party as their vehicle to run for the presidency. The eventual nominee would get $12.6 million in federal campaign money for the fall run.
Never mind that many national polls had Mr. Buchanan pulling less than 2 percent of the popular vote and Mr. Hagelin less than 1 percent. Or, as Russell Verney, who helped Mr. Perot found the party in 1992, put it in one of the few humorous moments of the week: "It's a close one, all right. John Hagelin is within one point of Pat Buchanan."
The competition between the two men grew so intense and angry that they convened separate conventions and nominating processes in adjacent convention halls.
Mr. Buchanan ended up with more delegates than Mr. Hagelin -- mainly, it appeared, because he had seized control of party machinery in many states with the help of the "Buchanan Brigades" from his earlier presidential runs. Mr. Hagelin accused the Brigades of having used everything from fraud to plain sneakiness to take over state organizations. He filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission and said he would go to court if necessary to prove that he was Mr. Perot's deserving successor.
In accepting his nomination tonight, Mr. Buchanan talked of "new reforms," but they had little to do with changing government. Rather, he repeated what he has been demanding for the better part of a decade -- outlawing abortion, reining in "arrogant, unelected judges, ending racial quotas and preferences."
Mr. Hagelin talked reform and only reform in his acceptance speech. He also invoked Mr. Perot's name and memory.
Mr. Perot is still a hero to many Reformers. But since he cut off contact with the party -- he has seldom mentioned it publicly in almost two years -- there has been no grass-roots push to bring him back. The impression is that many party members are thankful for his contribution but feel that he has had his run.

HEADLINE: Los Angeles Power Brokers Play Catch-Up to the City's Rapid Changes

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Aug. 12

 BODY:
Charlie Woo is the sort of business and civic leader one would expect to find at the head of the welcoming line at the Democratic National Convention next week, and, in fact, he will be, as a vice chairman of the city's host committee.
But perhaps the most revealing aspect of Mr. Woo's prominence and devotion to an impressive array of community organizations is the boards that he -- like many of the other successful people in the city's new wave of leaders -- is not on. 
 Mr. Woo will soon become the first Asian-American chairman of the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce, and he has helped guide groups involved in everything from voter registration to inner-city job development and Chinese-American political fund-raising. But even though he is an obvious candidate, he has no involvement in the prestigious institutions that once stood at the apex of civic life here, the philanthropies, art museums and especially the downtown Performing Arts Center.
"That represents a different world that isn't relevant to me in the same way these things might have been in the past," said Mr. Woo, a toy manufacturer. "The power shift that is taking place here is not just new ethnic groups rising, but a new approach to how you get involved."
Major public events like the Democratic convention are opportunities for the host cities to put a well-scrubbed face forward and for their power elite to stand on a national stage, displaying a shared sense of civic pride and identity.
But in Los Angeles, a sprawling concatenation of communities with a restless multiethnic character, there is no single "face," in the usual sense of the word. A surge of immigration and the rapid shift toward an economy dominated by small businesses rather than huge corporations have pushed Los Angeles into a dizzyingly complex transition.
The city, with a population nearing four million, has lost its white majority and will soon have a Latino majority, with a swiftly growing number of Asian-Americans. But despite these shifts, the power elite at the most well-recognized civic bodies remains heavily white.
For instance, the Performing Arts Center, formerly known as the Music Center and once the most prestigious social prize, today has 81 board members, 4 of whom are minority members. There are 2 minority members on the Los Angeles County Museum of Art's 39-member board, and the pattern of underrepresentation of the city's emerging minorities is similar at some other traditionally important boards, from the Huntington Library to the University of Southern California.
As many leaders point out, there is, in truth, no single power elite here today, but many, some of whom are just emerging and have made it clear they have little interest in the traditional avenues for civic involvement, which had long been closed to them. This has long been true for Hollywood power brokers, who have historically shown almost no interest in the standard civic groups, and now the attitude seems to be spreading to emerging ethnic groups.
Indeed, the host committee for the Democratic convention limped from one crisis to another, at least partly because there was no longer a lengthy A-list of reliable contributors to call whenever a financing problem arose. There have been plenty of other disappointments, from the tepid new millennium celebration to the city's continued failure to secure a professional football team, all considered a product of the lack of a shared vision by a unified power group. But the most potent symbol of the decline of the old order was the sale of The Los Angeles Times earlier this year to the Tribune Company of Chicago by its controlling shareholders, the Chandler family, which once defined civic commitment but has now all but vanished.
Today, few of Los Angeles's governing elites really know one another well, lunch together or golf together, or share much beyond a conviction that the whole notion of civic leadership must be broadened.
The Democrats, in short, will be seeking to define themselves for the new millennium in a city that has lost its unified old civic aristocracy and has yet to find a new one.
"In the old days there was a real power structure and it was clearly defined and you knew how to access it," said Gordon Davidson, a founder and artistic director of the Center Theater Group at the Performing Arts Center, home to many of the city's most festive and elite fund-raising galas. "The sad thing now is that we don't have it in the same way. It's a healthy sign, but it means you have to work a lot harder."
He added: "Frankly, it's what makes being here still something of an adventure. The question that I don't really have an answer to is, who is setting the pace?"
Linda Griego, an entrepreneur and a former deputy mayor, says she grows slightly irritated when asked why the old-line boards do not have more Latino or Asian-American or black members. In short, she said, many elites from minority groups are frustrated that these older organizations have not been more aggressive in courting them. But she said that leaders who are members of minorities often do not join those boards, even when they are invited, because their missions did not seem to serve the ethnic population.
"The old aristocracy is really gone," said Ms. Griego, who has served on boards as varied as hospitals, community redevelopment, the local community college system and the city's cultural affairs office. "It was kind of a downtown, music-center nucleus, based on old families and huge corporations. But what I ask is, where would a Latina get a feeling of fulfillment, of having made it? I think it's a different kind of civic board."
For instance, Dominic Ng, the chairman of the EastWest Bank here, said that when he was first urged to join the high-status local board of the United Way about five years ago, he hesitated.
"My first reaction was, why should I join? They don't do much for the Asian-American or even the Hispanic communities," said Mr. Ng, an immigrant from Hong Kong. But he said he was persuaded that by joining he could help alter the philanthropy's mission, and, with the help of some committed board colleagues, he has. The United Way has cut back on its contributions to traditional recipients, like the American Heart Association, and poured money into programs that will help train new immigrants for jobs and help them buy homes. Mr. Ng is now the board's vice chairman. He serves on other boards as well, but he said that he sees little need to join the traditional boards of the old power elite.
"Many of those organizations have asked me, but I declined," Mr. Ng said. "I feel I need first to help the poor and to really help change the community."
Economics have exerted a major influence over these trends. Nearly all of the Fortune 500 companies that once had headquarters in Los Angeles, from Arco and Unocal to the First Interstate Bank, have been acquired or have moved elsewhere. Along with this shift, the downtown district has atrophied, as the thriving new businesses have tended to move to other parts of the city and region.
Instead, this has become an economy that is dominated by myriad small companies. And members of minorities have found it far easier to rise in the entrepreneurial ranks than in the old corporate hierarchies, a fact that has also contributed to the changing civic architecture of Los Angeles.
"We know we have to reach out more," said Joanne Corday Kozberg, the president of the Performing Arts Center. "We need to reach the entrepreneurial base, and by that you really mean a lot of people of color. You have to look at where the community is going. We may need to focus more on trade, and we hadn't done that before."
Mr. Davidson, of the theater group, said one irony was the fact that his staff was far more diverse than his board, in part because it was proving far easier to find minority artists interested in working at the theater than in finding minority business leaders interested in setting artistic policy. That still leaves many people here frustrated.
"There is a disconnect between the changing face of Los Angeles and the political, economic and civic leadership circles," said Antonio Villaraigosa, a former speaker of the California Assembly. "Los Angeles is the Ellis Island of the west. These civic organizations really lag what is happening in the population."
He said the key to the changes and the city's future vitality was not that some of the old elite organizations are opening their doors, but that the more dynamic leaders are forging their own paths, without feeling obliged to follow in the footsteps of the elites of previous generations.
Luis Nogales, a child of migrant farm laborers who was recently named to the board of the J. Paul Getty Trust, expressed frustration at the pace of civic change and a sobering view of the multiple barriers that will need to fall to speed the pace.
"I've had too many firsts," said Mr. Nogales, an entrepreneur who was the first Latino graduate of Stanford's law school and the first Latino trustee of Stanford. "One of the problems is that the first step is usually for show. But I make it a point not to be the last Hispanic member of those boards, and that takes a lot of work." He added: "It's a good start to be on a board, but it's a start. I'm not satisfied to just get the appointment. I come with an agenda. Making any difference means you have to work twice as hard."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE VICE PRESIDENT;
GORE SAYS SPEECH WILL GIVE DETAILS OF HIS OWN AGENDA

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Aug. 12

 BODY:
Vice President Al Gore said today that in his acceptance speech to the Democratic National Convention he would embrace President Clinton's success in presiding over the hardy economy but send an unmistakable message: "I'm running on my own agenda, on my own voice and through my own experiences."
In the first extensive interview previewing his address to the delegates on Thursday -- the most momentous of his political career -- Mr. Gore also said the speech at the Staples Center here would be loaded with policy specifics, because he wanted the public to know he had a definite agenda to lead the country. 
 And he said he would pledge to connect with the American public as president by constantly holding "town meetings" with ordinary citizens that would become "a major theme of my presidency."
Mr. Gore spoke by telephone from Pittsburgh on the last weekend of campaigning before joining the stream of delegates heading to the first convention in this city since John F. Kennedy was nominated in 1960. Hillary Rodham Clinton, who was already here, said today that she and the president would stay just long enough to proclaim their support for Mr. Gore, then drop "out of sight." Page 23.
Vowing to "speak very concretely," Mr. Gore said he would outline his plan for cutting taxes for middle-class families and altering the Social Security system, his championing of the environment and his role "in efforts to set time limits and reform welfare."
"The reason I'm going to take the risk of going into specifics," he said, "is that I think people ought to know the issues that are at stake."
He said he believed that his decision to speak in detail, reminiscent of Mr. Clinton's policy-laden State of the Union messages, was a gamble because "the modern trend has been to resort to the vaguest of generalities and not to challenge the audience with specifics and hard substance. I don't go along with that."
His implicit suggestion was that Gov. George W. Bush's acceptance speech in Philadelphia had been short on substance.
Mr. Gore made clear that his proposal for town meetings was intended to help address what some of his advisers say has been his central vulnerability: that he is not personally appealing to the public.
"It will be the centerpiece of the way I conduct an open, continuing, candid, no-holds-barred dialogue with the American people throughout the Gore-Lieberman administration," said Mr. Gore, who was known for holding endless public sessions when he was a young congressman from Tennessee.
He said he welcomed the comments this week by Mr. Clinton that the vice president should not be tarred with any scandals of the Clinton years. "I appreciate what the president said," Mr. Gore said. "He repeated what he said in the past and what many others have said: This campaign is about the future."
Dismissing worries among some Democratic officials that the Clintons were looming over the proceedings here and distracting attention from him, Mr. Gore repeated: "This election is about the future. It is about the choice that has to be made between Governor Bush and myself. Anyone who doubts that underestimates the desire of the American people."
Yet some Democrats here expressed concerns that the Clintons have hardly slipped gently away as Mr. Gore's big week approaches. Recognizing, perhaps, that he has overwhelmed the news coverage in the run-up to the convention, Mr. Clinton abruptly canceled television interviews scheduled for this weekend. And White House officials said they called off an interview with The New York Times because they were furious about the newspaper's coverage of how the Clintons are the headline attractions at fund-raising events here that competed with Mr. Gore's.
The overriding objective of the delegates here was to name a ticket that would continue eight years of their party's rule in the White House. But thus far, Mr. Clinton's long shadow has been the talk of the convention.
Edward G. Rendell, the general chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said in an interview that Mr. Clinton had resisted a Monday speaking slot here because he thought Tuesday would be a bigger night. Mr. Rendell, the former mayor of Philadelphia, said he had persuaded Mr. Clinton to settle on Monday -- and to leave town the next day -- by telling him he would draw a larger audience if he delivered his address immediately after what would surely be a highly rated Titans-Rams football game.
"The reason I was able to sell him on Monday was the Titans-Rams game," Mr. Rendell said. "I said, 'Look, we've got to get the maximum audience because there's nobody alive who can better explain why Al Gore should be president than you.' "
Mr. Gore said it would not be fair to compare his task to that of Vice President George Bush in 1988, who advisers said was essentially offering himself as the steward of a third term of the Reagan administration. Rather than merely continue with Mr. Clinton's achievements, Mr. Gore said his message would be that he could build on the economic successes of the last eight years.
"I will make a new start to include those who have not yet fully enjoyed the benefits of the progress we have made," Mr. Gore said, "and upon which I can launch this new effort to connect the American people to the full spirit of our democracy: the open meetings."
Mr. Gore's advisers said his speech would be a pivotal moment in his stepping out from Mr. Clinton. Asked if he would mention Mr. Clinton in his address, Mr. Gore replied: "Sure. I will say that the last eight years have been years of such remarkable economic progress and progress in lowering the crime rate and welfare reform, in significant measure because of his dedication to trying to create a better future."
Yet Mr. Gore also said he would put forth a new vision. "He gave us a foundation upon which I will build, upon which I will make a new start to include those who have not yet fully enjoyed the benefits of the progress we have made," he said.
The vice president said that while he would make contrasts with Mr. Bush and Dick Cheney, his running mate, on policy, he intended to keep his remarks upbeat. "It will be positive, positive, positive," Mr. Gore said of the speech, which he drafted largely himself. "And it will describe a time of tremendous hope and possibility. There will be no negative points about Governor Bush or Mr. Cheney, either overt or covert, either direct or implied. There will be direct comparisons of the approach Joe Lieberman and I take to the issues."
His pledge to stay positive in his speech, Mr. Gore insisted, was not rooted in any concern that the Republicans would continue to portray him as having a relentlessly negative campaign style.
"Now that the American people are beginning to tune into this dialogue, most of them for the first time," Mr. Gore said, "it is imperative that we elevate the tone of the campaign on both sides. I think there's a willingness to do that on the other side. And I hope the other side will see this convention and this speech as an opening of opportunities for them as well as for us."
Despite Mr. Gore's assurances, several Gore advisers and convention officials said that while they were mindful that the program should not appear harshly negative, some speakers would not shrink from aggressively taking on Mr. Bush and the Republicans. The wide belief among leading Democrats is that the sharp-edge remarks against Democrats at the Philadelphia convention, particularly by Mr. Cheney, gave them an excuse to fire back.
"I don't think they have a lot of credibility left on that anymore," said Robert Shrum, one of Mr. Gore's top advisers. "The Cheney and Bush speeches had a personally negative tone. Secondly, I think you can very respectfully discuss issues, and the differences you have on issues. People don't see that as a negative at all. They see that as something they're entitled to know."
Asked if Republicans might trap Democrats by goading them into lambasting Mr. Bush, then condemning them as too negative, Mr. Rendell said: "They had a chance but they blew that on Wednesday night. If they had run a sweetness-and-light convention on Wednesday night, it would have been difficult for us. We would have had to tread gingerly to even do issues comparatives without seeming negative."
Explaining how this convention would address matters like education and health care, Mr. Shrum ridiculed the largely cheery and temperate convention staged by the Republicans, saying: "Look, we've not trying to run an ersatz variety show. We're trying to run a convention that puts a person, in a very serious way, before the American public."
In the interview today, Mr. Gore said he was intent on reaching back -- to far before he became vice president -- for the public to understand what motivates him.
"I want them to know that the proposals I'm making for the future are rooted in my 24-year fight for working families," he said. "I want them to know that my proposal for regular open meetings as president is rooted in my experience in learning from the working families for whom I fought for 16 years in the House and Senate. I want them to know that my passion for protecting the environment is rooted in the battle that I've waged for almost a quarter century."
Democrats in Los Angeles said they were bracing for a livelier, and seemingly less disciplined, gathering than the Republican convention, in part because of the Clintons.
Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster, said Mr. Gore had more to gain from the convention than his opponent -- and maybe more to lose -- because as close as the polls are, Mr. Bush is now ahead and the vice president needs to scramble the dynamic. "The largest number of people," he said, "are going to learn the most about Al Gore during the course of this convention."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE FIRST LADY;
Clintons Promise Not to Step Into Gore's Spotlight

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Aug. 12

 BODY:
Hillary Rodham Clinton said today that she and President Clinton would stay at the Democratic National Convention just long enough to proclaim their support for Vice President Al Gore, and then drop completely from sight, doing nothing, she promised, that might steal attention from the celebration surrounding Mr. Gore's presidential nomination.
"We're down, we're gone, absolutely," the first lady announced in an interview in a suite at the heavily secured Century City hotel where the Clintons are staying this week. "We're going to be staying out of sight. Really. We want there to be nothing but a focus on the convention back in Los Angeles." 
 "We don't want there to be any attention -- anywhere -- except on Joe and Al," Mrs. Clinton said, referring to Joseph I. Lieberman, the Connecticut senator Mr. Gore has chosen as his running mate.
Mrs. Clinton, who said she was speaking for herself and the president, made her remarks at a time when Mr. Gore's supporters have assailed them both for embarking on a vigorous schedule of pre-convention politicking and fund-raising that has distracted from this climactic moment in Mr. Gore's career.
Mrs. Clinton grew animated at the mention of the criticism, shaking her head vigorously to dispute the suggestion that the Clintons were overshadowing Mr. Gore.
"There is no more enthusiastic supporter of Al Gore than I am," she said. "I just feel so strongly about his candidacy."
Mrs. Clinton, who is running for the United States Senate in New York, demurred when asked to describe how she and her husband intended to spend the rest of the week, though an aide said later that they would be going to a friend's waterside cabin in Lake Placid, N.Y. When asked if Mr. Clinton was aware of what the first couple would do once they finished their prime-time convention speeches on Monday night, Mrs. Clinton laughed, toyed with a glass of water on the round dining room table before her and responded evenly: "Yes. Absolutely."
She discussed the tangled ambitions and agendas of three of the nation's best-known Democrats -- Mr. Clinton Mr. Gore and herself -- in the course of an interview in which she talked at length about her campaign against Representative Rick A. Lazio, and how she hoped the convention in general, and her 10-minute speech on Monday night, would provide a lift both to her campaign and to Mr. Gore's.
The first lady, gazing across a smoggy expanse of Los Angeles from a window on the 19th floor of the St. Regis Hotel, argued that Mr. Lazio was, largely, a different kind of opponent from the one Mr. Gore faced in Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. Mr. Lazio, she asserted, repeatedly sought to obscure parts of his record to accommodate the Democratic electoral terrain in New York, while Mr. Bush has run more explicitly as a Republican.
The first lady, with an edge of frustration in her voice, described it as a "deliberate obfuscation of the record and the votes that were taken and a disclaiming of responsibility that I find troubling."
"I don't mind having a debate in a campaign with someone who says, you know, 'I don't think we should permit H.M.O.'s to be sued, and here are my three reasons,' " Mrs. Clinton said. "As opposed to someone saying, 'Well, I did support a patients' bill of rights.' "
She was referring to Mr. Lazio's support of limited Republican legislation to regulate H.M.O.'s, which Mr. Lazio has cited in response to Mrs. Clinton's criticism.
"Or you know, 'I really am pro-choice, it's just that I'm on the conservative party line and I've given them a big wink about what I really mean, and I won't commit to defending Roe v. Wade in any Supreme Court nomination process in the Senate,' " she said, continuing her remarks about Mr. Lazio. " 'But, gee, take me at my word, because I want to be all things to all people.' "
"He's the Republican-conservative candidate," she said. "New York is neither Republican nor conservative when it comes to guns and choice and education and health care and the economy."
In New York, Dan McLagan, a spokesman for Mr. Lazio, responded to Mrs. Clinton's remarks by taking note of the amount of time the first lady has devoted on this trip to raising campaign funds for her race. "It's flattering that the first lady would take time out of her busy soft-money feeding frenzy to attack Congressman Lazio," Mr. McLagan said.
The interview, one of a handful with New York reporters in time for the high-circulation Sunday newspapers, came as Mrs. Clinton continued to, in effect, use California as a base for her New York campaign in the midst of the convention festivities. A fund-raiser tonight in Malibu could raise anywhere from $1 million to $4 million for her.
That fund-raiser was one of the events that drew some expressions of concern from Mr. Gore's supporters. Mrs. Clinton, though, asserted that she had taken pains to avoid any conflicts with Mr. Gore's campaign during their visits here.
"Everything we're doing has been coordinated with the vice president and Tipper and top levels of our staff," she said, referring to the vice president's wife, Tipper. Mrs. Clinton emphasized her point by gesturing with a hand loaded down with a charm bracelet. Asked if that meant that she would allow Mr. Gore's advisers to review her speech before she delivered it on Monday, Mrs. Clinton grinned and responded: "Of course I would. I haven't written it yet. I worked on it this morning. But you know -- if they want to see it, I'd be more than happy to show it to them. It's only 10 minutes long."
Similarly, she asserted there was no need for explicit coordination on what she should say. "We know each other so well," Mrs. Clinton said, leaning back in a room that was empty except for a floral arrangement and trays of cookies and soft drinks. (She and the president were staying on another floor).
"They don't need to give me talking points," she continued. "We know what our talking points are for this administration."
As to her own campaign in New York, Mrs. Clinton said that Mr. Lazio was going to great lengths to camouflage his record, and pointed to his decision to spend a minimal amount of time at the Republican convention. "I think that's why he didn't want to spend a lot of time in Philadelphia," she said, referring to the Republican convention two weeks ago. "I think he's hoping that New Yorkers will somehow not know where he stands and what he has voted for in the past. I think now that the campaign is into the final stretch, that's going to be hard to avoid."
The first lady said she believed she was now entering a new phase of the race and expressed confidence that a contest that has seemed frozen -- with poll after poll showing her tied with Mr. Lazio despite her repeated attacks on his record -- would begin to move once the conventions were over and people considered the choice before them.
"It's a question of time," she said. "It's a question of issues. And people understanding what's really at stake in the election, and what the differences between us are."

Time's Hands Go Back On National Debt Clock

BYLINE: By EUN LEE KOH

 BODY:
For 11 years, the National Debt Clock glowered from its perch on the Avenue of the Americas and grimly flashed to passers-by the government's growing financial woes, racking up an average of $10,000 a second in national debt.
The clock was the brainchild of Seymour Durst, the former president of the Durst Organization, a commercial real estate firm that owns and maintains the clock. He wanted a vivid way to show Americans how big the national debt was, and also to nudge elected officials to do something about it. He died in 1995. 
 According to Douglas Durst, Seymour's son and the president of the Durst Organization, his father had always been politically active, but he was particularly vocal about his concerns about the national debt. He sent letters to legislators and paid for advertisements, Mr. Durst said.
During the holiday season in 1980, the elder Durst sent a card that said "Happy New Year. Your share of the national debt is $35,000" to senators and congressmen, Mr. Durst said.
But a lot has changed since 1989 when the clock first started ticking.
During the clock's tenure, the national debt grew from just under $3 trillion to more than $5 trillion.
But the country's economic picture has gotten much rosier -- so much so that since June, the clock has been running backward to reflect the decreasing debt.
"I'm very pleased it has served its purpose, but the debt's going down now," Mr. Durst said. "The whole point of it was to show the debt going up. It did what it was supposed to do."
Douglas Durst said he was unsure as to what he will do with the clock, but it is to be covered with a shroud at a ceremony on Sept. 7. A red, white, and blue sign that says "The National Debt Clock" will hang in front of it.
"In case we need it again," Mr. Durst said. "I hope we won't, but you never know what could happen to the debt again." EUN LEE KOH

HEADLINE: Syracuse Looking to Mall For Tourists (and Money)

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON

 BODY:
In many parts of the country, a proposal for a super-duper tourist-attracting mega-mall would be greeted with howls of protest, followed by reams of lawsuits.
Not in Syracuse, where many citizens are embracing the mall plan as a way to revive their struggling city. Their praise, however, is less enthusiastic than resigned; a popular sign at a public hearing last month was, "Do You Have a Better Alternative?" 
 The mall could well become the largest shopping center in the country (excluding the island of Manhattan). Its developers, the Pyramid Management Group, plan to triple the size of their existing mall, the Carousel Center, and turn it into a 103-acre shopping and entertainment extravaganza, with hotels, restaurants and even an aquarium.
The current 1.6 million-square-foot mall would be expanded to 4.5 million square feet; the leader in the enormous mall sweepstakes, the Mall of America outside Minneapolis, is 4.2 million square feet, although there are plans to expand it, too.
But metropolitan Minneapolis is four times the size of Syracuse, which has a population of only 735,000. Minneapolis is also far more prosperous. The average household income around the Mall of America is about $66,000, versus about $47,000 for households near the Carousel Center, according to data from the International Council of Shopping Centers.
Dozens of new malls, full of movie theaters, skating rinks and other attractions, are in the works across the country, the council reports. None of them are as big as the one proposed for Syracuse, and almost all of them are being built in booming areas. But Syracuse has only recently emerged from a decade-long recession during which it lost residents.
Even the mall's supporters concede that Syracuse seems an unlikely place for a mammoth mall. "Intuition tells you this isn't going to be that great," said Vito Sciscioli, the commissioner of economic development for the city, from which the developers are seeking tax breaks for the $900 million project. But, he said, consultants hired by the city to evaluate the plan told him, "You've got a hot one here."
The reason? Tourists. The mall's backers think that millions of tourists will go to the expanded mall, bringing lots of cash into Syracuse (more than $1 billion, by one estimate). Luring them, the developers say, will be stores with outdoor themes, catering to hunters, campers and anglers. After all, L. L. Bean draws hordes to Freeport, Me., and the Bass Pro Shop is "the largest tourist attraction in the state of Missouri," said Bruce A. Kenan, a partner at Pyramid.
Tourists do seem to visit giant malls, especially those that bill themselves as theme parks. Opry Mills, which opened in Nashville in May and attracted 100,000 people on its first day, says about 30 percent of its visitors are not from Tennessee. Foreign tourists account for more than 5 percent of the 42.5 million people who visit the Mall of America (which has an amusement park) each year.
Developers must court travel agents and tour operators and travel writers, however. They spend a lot to attract people, said Therese Byrne, who writes the newsletter Retail Maxim. "Is Pyramid set up to do that?" she asked. She added that she was a little dubious of the hunting and fishing theme, noting that 80 percent of shoppers are women.
But while many tourists shop when they travel, how many travel just to shop remains unclear. Most successful tourist malls are in places tourists already visit, like Florida, Southern California and next to the Dallas-Fort Worth airport.
Though it is hardly a tourist mecca, Syracuse does draw hundreds of thousands of people every year for the State Fair, and crowds attend sporting events at the Syracuse University. The city is at the junction of the state Thruway and Interstate 81.
"There's huge snowbird traffic, and they need destinations along the way," said Peggy R. Bendel, a senior vice president at Development Counsellors International.
The developers concede that were they not based in Syracuse, they would not be pursuing the project. "If you didn't have the emotional attachment, you wouldn't do it," Mr. Kenan said.
That sentiment may help Pyramid calm fears expressed at a public hearing and in letters to the Syracuse newspapers that the mall expansion will be a windfall for Robert J. Congel, Pyramid's founder. It may prove less reassuring to the financial institutions backing the project, especially now that interest rates have gone up and enthusiasm for mall deals has cooled.
The developers said they would expand the mall in two stages, with construction beginning next spring. They say the current mall draws 17 million visitors a year and is bursting at the seams. "We're 98-point-something leased," said Stephen J. Congel, whose father, Robert, is in charge of leasing space in the expanded mall.
Pyramid built the Palisades Center in West Nyack, N.Y., which was the target of community protests and lawsuits for more than a decade. The company said the shopping mall was doing extremely well. But not all of the developers' projects have panned out: a shopping center in Providence, R.I., that Pyramid started work on in 1983 changed hands in 1996 and finally opened last year.
And some of the partners in other Pyramid projects recently sued the company and Robert J. Congel, saying he siphoned money from some of his other malls to support the ones in Syracuse and West Nyack and to pay some of his own bills. He and Pyramid have denied the charges in court filings.
Pyramid has had some financial problems, in part because the Carousel Center turned out to be far more expensive to build than expected.
The mall sits on the site of an old junkyard. The land is so marshy that the mall does not sit on pilings but floats on the soupy ground; water is pumped in or out to keep it stable. The expanded mall would cover more of Oil City, which was polluted by oil tanks, north of the city near the Onondaga Lake and Canal. One reason Syracuse officials are supporting the mall is that the land will probably not find any other takers, unless the government cleans it up, said Mr. Sciscoli, the city commissioner.
Pyramid, which pays almost no real estate taxes now, has asked Syracuse to defer levying any such taxes for 30 years. The developer would then make payments in lieu of taxes to pay off tax-exempt bonds, which would finance road improvements and parking garages. Mayor Roy Bernardi and the developers have agreed on the deal, which is under consideration by city and county legislators.
Some in Syracuse have suggested that the city would do better to grab real estate taxes on the current mall, rather than give them up for three decades to help finance a bigger mall.
Minchin G. Lewis, the city auditor, said the city would get relatively little money from the mall's property taxes, but could get a lot more if the expanded mall succeeded. "The city's being asked to give the developer a baseball bat and hope it hits a home run," he said. "If it strikes out, we don't lose anything."

BYLINE: By Michael Lewis; Michael Lewis is a contributing writer for The Times Magazine. He is the author, most recently, of "The New New Thing."

 BODY:
It is interesting how new technology arrives. On the one hand, there is something arbitrary about invention; on the other, every society seems to get the technology it deserves. Take ours, for example. The current phase of American capitalism began on Nov. 9, 1989, with the formal collapse of socialism. Suddenly, there was no need to flavor the free market with a dash of something else. The little pockets of socialism that had been tolerated when socialism posed a threat now, overnight, seemed horribly retrograde. Why have your capitalism diluted when you can have it straight? Since then, as if by some marvelous coincidence, a lot of new technology has arrived to enhance market forces. The Internet is one such technology. It creates new markets and new competition in old markets and helps to put a better price on everything. In a few short years, it has pretty much gutted the principles of corporate socialism -- jobs for life, employee and customer loyalty, all for one and one for all -- and replaced them with Lord knows what.
On any time line that describes this phase of American capitalism, you would have to include (in addition to Nov. 9, 1989) April 4, 1994 (birthday of Netscape), Nov. 10, 1994 (birthday of Amazon.com), May 5, 1996 (birthday of eBay) -- and Aug. 4, 1997. Aug. 4, 1997, was the beginning of the end of another socialistic force in American life: the mass market. Forty years from now when you have your grandson on your knee and he asks you, "Grandma, how did 50 million Americans ever let themselves be talked into buying the same mouthwash?" you will say, "Well, you have to know how things were before Aug. 4, 1997." 
 That was the day a pair of Silicon Valley engineers named Jim Barton and Mike Ramsay started their own technology company. They had no idea what that company might do. It didn't matter: all over Silicon Valley engineers were founding companies before they had any idea of what their companies might do; the urge to innovate preceded the innovation. The Internet had created a climate of entrepreneurship. It was assumed that even ordinarily smart engineers with the desire to create something new could do so with impunity, and Barton and Ramsay were more than ordinarily smart. They were so smart that a pair of venture capital firms -- New Enterprise Associates and Institutional Venture Partners -- advanced them several million dollars to get them started, few questions asked. "Three million dollars was pocket change," Ramsay explains.
Barton and Ramsay's first idea was to turn the American home into a network. Computer people have long imagined that the ordinary American home one day would be fully networked, leaving everyone else to wonder exactly what that means. Will the refrigerator order fresh milk directly from the grocery store? Will the furnace and the fish feeder and the vacuum cleaner respond to commands from the office desktop? Anything is possible. That was the good part about home networking as a business idea: the Internet had made it feasible. The bad part about the idea was that it was hard to see the point of it. Oh, it was easy enough to get worked up about it with a fellow geek, but Ramsay and Barton discovered they couldn't explain their dream to anyone else. Ramsay puts it this way: "When you build a company around a technology and someone says, 'Tell me again what this thing does?' you need to be able to say, 'It does this.' We found that we couldn't say what home networking did."
And so, after a few months, they abandoned home networking. They went back to their venture capitalists and told them that home networking was a bad idea because they couldn't explain it to anyone but other geeks. They had another idea, though. Instead of transforming the entire American home, they decided to focus on the one appliance that was the closest thing to the center of attention in the American home: the television.
Barton had become obsessed with the television a few years earlier, when he worked at what was then the hottest computer company in Silicon Valley, Silicon Graphics. In the early 1990's, Time Warner, AT&T, Microsoft, Silicon Graphics and other big technology and media companies fell in love with the same idea: that they could change the way Americans watched television. A new device -- variously known as the telecomputer, interactive television or the black box -- could be plonked down on top of the American television to offer the viewer an entirely new experience, one in which he would be able to e-mail, shop and access a virtual library of movies from his couch. There ensued a mad scramble, and Barton was a part of it. He helped to build the only interactive television that actually worked, installed in late 1994 by Time Warner in 4,000 homes in Orlando, Fla., and then watched in dismay as his beloved project was overrun by the Internet. The Internet did a fraction of what the new TV's promised, but at a fraction of the price.
Of the few people who dwelled on the way the Internet had swamped interactive television, Barton may have dwelled on it the most. Like a lot of really smart engineers, Barton has the air of a man used to figuring things out. Ask him a question, and a little smile and just a hint of self-satisfaction flickers beneath his light brown mustache and reminds you, gently, that he knows a lot more than the answer. But the TV gnawed at him precisely because he didn't have the answer. He had sunk the better part of three years into building Silicon Graphics' interactive television, and it had been a commercial disaster. The box worked. And yet no one cared. There were several lessons in this:
No. 1: Brilliant gadgets for a mass market do not go anywhere if the masses cannot afford them.
No. 2: A big company is not necessarily the best place to create a revolutionary technology.
No. 3: The whims of the American consumer are the eighth wonder of the world. They can wreak havoc with the most powerful establishments.
When Barton and Ramsay returned to the television, they had in mind another black box, at once more and less ambitious than the interactive television. They called it a personal television receiver, but never mind about that. It was a black box. The main thing about the black box was that it had a memory. It could record any program as it was watched, as well as anything its owner instructed it to record. This is, of course, what VCR's were designed to do but didn't, since no American, not even a geek, could figure out how to make them work. The new box would be simple to program. It was a VCR that did what it was supposed to do, even if you were a moron. But it was far more versatile than that. The viewer could record a great many hours of programming. Or he could simply tell the box to go out and find him the kind of programs he liked. If he liked indiscreet women, he could record and store every episode of "Sex and the City." If he liked intelligent blood and guts, he didn't need to wait until TNT's Clint Eastwood week -- he could just instruct his black box to fetch Clint Eastwood movies as they played. Once the box was up and running, the viewer's only constraint on choice was that the program had to be broadcast by someone, sometime.
The black box also enabled the viewer to treat all television -- even live television -- as television he had recorded for his own private use. All he would need to do is start watching a program a few minutes after it began. Then, by pressing a button, he could skip the credits, the huddles, the timeouts, the weather, the endless clicking of the "60 Minutes" stopwatch and all the other boring stretches of television designed by producers to lull the viewers into watching ads. He could also skip the ads.
Over time, the viewer would create, in essence, his own private television channel, stored on a hard drive in the black box, tailored with great precision to his interests. His ability to do this would depend on the amount of computer memory in this box. At the start, Barton reckoned, a black box that cost $1,499 would be able to store about 28 hours of programming; one that cost $699 would be good for six hours. But with the price of computer memory falling by half every 18 months, the price of the box would plummet: in less than a decade, a black box costing no more than $100 would be able to store the equivalent of an entire Blockbuster Video outlet.
There was one other cool thing that the black box did -- though Barton didn't dwell on it much at first. While the viewer watched the television, the box would watch the viewer. It would record the owner's viewing habits in a way that TV viewing habits had never been recorded. The viewer's every decision would be stored in a kind of private museum of whims. Over time, the box would come to know what the viewer liked maybe even better than the viewer himself. All by itself, it would go and record shows that it calculated the viewer might like to watch. The box was more than a box, it was a butler, and the more it learned about its master's whims, the more it would be able to fetch what its master wanted.
The box had certain advantages over every other attempt to transform the television -- and there had been many. One was its phenomenal simplicity. Unlike, say, the VCR, it required almost no technical aptitude. The black box would turn the television into a computer but without making any computerlike demands on the viewer: all the consumer would see was a slightly busier remote control. Another advantage was price. A revised final advantage was that you could explain it all to an ordinary human being. When someone asked Barton or Ramsay, "Tell me again what this gadget does?" they now had a simple answer: "It lets you watch anything you want to watch when you want to watch it."
Ramsay and Barton decided that in spite of appearances, TiVo, which is what they decided to call their new company, was not a maker of black boxes but a service for people who owned black boxes. TiVo would help each and every American to create his own private television channel. Of course, in the beginning, they would need to build the black box and sell it to the masses. But the black box was not where the money was -- the box was, in fact, a big money loser. To kick-start the market, Ramsay, 50, now C.E.O., and Barton, 42, the chief technology officer, would need to pay some consumer electronics company like Sony or Philips to manufacture the black boxes and to sell them below cost. The trick was to get as many black boxes into the American home as possible. Once the new boxes were proved to delight their audience, TiVo would then offer its services to the masses: the company's programming software would be in millions of new homes either in tandem with existing cable boxes or, in the future, embedded in new TV sets, cable boxes or satellite receivers made by companies like Sony or Philips. Thus, the long-term goal of the black box was to become unnecessary. "We'll know we've succeeded when the TiVo box vanishes," Barton says.
The ambition of the thing was breathtaking. The company intended to plop itself down between the 102 million homes with televisions and the $50 billion TV industry. Once the box was in place, TiVo would be the hub of the television industry. The company would come to know the subtle preferences of each and every television viewer. It would then be able to charge a fee to anyone who wanted to locate TV viewers or groups of viewers: networks, cable companies, advertisers. The trick was to get the box into those 102 million homes -- and that would cost money. Lots. Ramsay went back to the venture capitalists and told them that he and Barton needed to lose between $300 million and $400 million before they became profitable. Prior to the Internet boom, the capitalists were chary about sinking one-tenth of that sum into a small, risky venture; now they didn't think twice. "Instead of saying, 'No,"' says Ramsay, "they said, 'Great."'
What made the enthusiasm of TiVo's financial backers even more astonishing was that a rival company had already sprung up. Anthony Wood, a young entrepreneur, stumbled on the same idea as Barton and Ramsay at roughly the same time. Wood, who made a lot of money in computer games, had been frustrated by his inability to persuade his VCR to record episodes of his favorite show, "Star Trek." He saw the same big trends that had lighted a fire under Barton and Ramsay: the falling price of computer memory, the TV viewer's desire for choice, the continued inability of Americans to program their VCR's. In early 1998, not long after Barton and Ramsay got their first financing, Wood generously agreed to accept $8 million from the venture capitalists Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and Paul Allen's Vulcan Ventures. He called his new company Replay Networks.
Another mad scramble to transform the television was under way, but this time it was more attuned to the spirit of the marketplace -- the approach came from the bottom up rather than from the top down. "This is the Trojan horse for the computer industry to gain control of the entertainment industry," says Marc Andreessen, a Netscape co-founder who invested his own money in Replay. "It is the first box built by Silicon Valley that is compelling enough that people want to hook it up to their TV sets."
The new companies were proposing to do politely to the television industry what Napster was about to do to the music industry: help consumers to help themselves to entertainment without "paying" the networks and advertisers. Naturally, this disturbed the television networks and advertisers. This winter, Stacy Jolna, TiVo's liaison with the networks, appeared on a panel before the National Association of Broadcasters. Jon Mandel, an ad executive with MediaCom, was also on the panel. "He started by calling me and everyone involved with this technology 'the devil incarnate,"' Jolna says. "And he went on from there. The basic attitude of TV executives was that we were somehow going to destroy a $50 billion business model."
By March 1999, the first TiVo and Replay boxes had already shipped. By the beginning of this summer, several hundred thousand more boxes had been rolled out. A Replay box with 30 hours of storage cost $499. A TiVo box with 30 hours of storage cost $399 -- but then the company generally charges a subscription fee of $9.95 a month. Until this June, the companies had sold about 100,000 boxes between them, and they had done so largely without advertising their products. Several market analysts estimate that TiVo and Replay will have sold five to seven million boxes by the end of 2002 -- and that within a decade they will be in 90 million U.S. homes. But that's just guessing. No one knows how quickly the companies can arm the entire American population, or even if they will do so. The black box is not, like the VCR, a winner-take-all market. There is room for a lot of different companies to sell the same seditious technology and to coexist happily with one another. They're seizing control of a $50 billion industry from its creators; there's more than enough booty to go around.
"The one question our investors did ask us," Ramsay says, "is 'How long will it take for the TV networks to hate you so much that they shut you down?"'
Talk to enough people at TiVo and Replay and pester enough people at the networks and the big advertising firms, and you come to realize that they have two stories to tell: an official story and a true story. The official story is believed by practically no one, not even journalists. It's pure ritual, made necessary by the desire of everyone concerned not to dwell on the violence about to occur in a huge industry. The official story is that these new black boxes won't destroy the television industry as we know it; they'll merely enable its current rulers to make it an even better place.
Right from the start, TiVo set out to persuade the networks of this pleasant notion in the hope of avoiding lawsuits. To do this, they had to play down a lot of what made their box desirable to a consumer. Instead of a button that enables the viewer explicitly to skip commercials, for instance, Barton designed one fast-forward button with three speeds, which might be called fast forward, faster forward and faster-faster forward. The TiVo user is able to speed through the commercials but not skip them entirely: the ad still makes some sort of blurry impression on the viewer. "Network psychology is to have a line in the sand mentality," says Ramsay. "If you're on one side of the line, you're their friend. If you're on the other side of the line, you're their enemy. Advertising the ability to skip commercials is on the other side of the line. We designed the technology so that it doesn't infuriate the networks."
Replay Networks, now called ReplayTV, at first took the position that the networks' interests were irrelevant. What the American consumer wanted, the American consumer eventually got, and so you might as well give it to him right away. Replay's remote control has a button marked "QuickSkip," which lets the viewer leap ahead in increments of 30 seconds, the length of a typical TV commercial. The owner of the Replay box is thus the open adversary of the television establishment. "I spent a lot of the first year getting thrown out of meetings at networks," Anthony Wood admits. Then came a change of the Replay heart, when Wood was replaced as C.E.O. by Kim LeMasters, the former president of CBS Entertainment, who saw the point of network support. LeMasters struck a much more conciliatory note. Though he wasn't able to scrap QuickSkip, he let it be known that he would not promote the feature. "The Replay device doesn't do any good if it doesn't have anything to broadcast," he says.
And so now the two companies are in roughly the same position of arguing to the networks that a device that steals their power and hands it to consumers is actually good for them. They offer two points to support the case. The first is that the television viewer is too inert for the television to change. Several times since the first commercial broadcast in 1939, a new accessory has appeared that promised a revolution -- the VCR, the remote control, cable TV -- only to be assimilated without greatly disrupting the existing social order.
The VCR proved too unwieldy to be used for anything but rented videos. The remote control enabled people to surf but not so much that they spooked Procter & Gamble and General Motors and the rest. Cable TV fractured the mass audience into slightly smaller pieces, but again, without a huge effect on the economics of the business. True, the big three networks had 91 percent of the viewing audience in 1978 and only 45 percent in 1999. But it is also true that of the $45 billion of television advertising in 1999, $14 billion went to CBS, ABC and NBC, which is $10 billion more than they collected in 1978. (Advertisers have, until now, been willing to pay the networks more for less. It's as if what matters to them is not the absolute size of an audience but the relative one, and the three major networks still offer them the biggest.)
The other point is that by making television more appealing, the black box encourages people to watch even more of it. This prospect may cast doubts on the future of intelligent life, but it should, in theory, be good for TV networks. Replay now has actual data to prove that its new customers watch, on average, three hours more television each week than they did before they got the box. "Yes, we're messing with your business," they argue to the networks. "But in the end, you'll love us for it because three more hours a week means billions for you in additional advertising revenues." Marc Andreessen, for one, believes this argument is persuasive to networks. "They want to believe it because they are seeing data for the first time that shows young people are watching less and less TV and spending that time on the Internet."
That's the official story. It's the story that enables TiVo and Replay employees to interact pleasantly with network and advertising executives. But as I say, no one could possibly believe it, and it becomes less plausible every day thanks to the information piling up inside TiVo and Replay about how ordinary people use their new black boxes. They use them to undermine, with ruthless precision, the interests of TV networks and mass-market advertisers. The owners of the 100,000 or so black boxes that have already been installed have two distinctly unsettling new habits. The first is that they don't watch scheduled TV anymore. According to Josh Bernoff, a television industry analyst with Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass., who closely follows both the black-box companies, viewers "get into the habit of not paying attention to when the programs are on and just watch what they've recorded."
Well. If it doesn't matter when programs run, then the whole concept of prime time vanishes, and with it the network's ability to attract an audience for a new show simply by broadcasting it when people have the tube switched on. With it, also, goes the special market value of prime time -- though the market value of other broadcast space rises. Ditto the idea of pitting one show against another by virtue of its time slot. In the age of black boxes, every show ever broadcast competes against every other show for the viewer's attention; for this reason, whatever advantage a network has in the development of new TV shows disappears.
But that isn't the worst news that TiVo and Replay have for the television networks. The worst news is that no one watches commercials anymore. Eighty-eight percent -- 88 percent! -- of the advertisements in the programs seen by viewers on their black boxes went unwatched. If no one watches commercials, then there is no commercial television.
And yet -- and here is the punch line -- the major broadcast networks have done nothing but encourage the new technology. In August 1999, Time Warner, Disney and NBC, among others, sank $57 million into Replay. About the same time, NBC and CBS, among others, handed $45 million to TiVo. By the end of 1999, all three major television networks, along with most of the major Hollywood studios, the two biggest Hollywood talent agencies (I.C.M. and C.A.A.) and all the major cable and satellite TV companies, had either made investments or formed partnerships with both Replay and TiVo.
There are a lot of explanations for why the networks have rushed to embrace their own creative destruction, most of them premised on the idiocy of network executives. Only one of these explanations is plausible: they feel they have no choice. "If the networks could roll back the clock and prevent digital technology from ever happening, they'd do it," says LeMasters of Replay. "But how do you stop progress? We're offering them the chance to adapt." Tom Rogers, the former president of NBC's cable division who made the first network investment in TiVo and Replay, puts it this way: "We thought that the technology was going to come, and it was better to have some voice in shaping it than none." It was the promise of NBC's imprimatur, in fact, that caused TiVo to design its remote control without what Rogers calls "the ad zapper." By the time Replay decided that it might be useful to have the endorsement and money of the networks, the company was too far along to eliminate QuickSkip, its ad zapper. NBC gave Replay money anyway. "We couldn't be in a position of being seen to promote a technology that was intended to undermine the economic support of the industry," says Rogers, explaining the quiet promise not to market the feature to consumers. That was in late 1998. Since then, Rogers has left NBC to become chairman of Primemedia, a holding company for lots of little niche media. Today, Replay markets its ad zapper. And one of TiVo's new advertisements features a network executive being hurled out a window by a pair of goons.
Their indiscriminate hurling of money at both TiVo and Replay suggests that the networks understand that the companies trying to commercialize the technology are, in a way, irrelevant. (Why not just back the one who promises to be less hostile?) It's the technology that matters; and it's the technology that is sure to win. "A lot of these guys had their bell rung four years ago by the Internet," says Steve Shannon of Replay, "and they don't want to be humiliated a second time." The Internet gave birth to a new corporate religion to replace the one it killed. The religion says: change is inevitable. The question now being posed by the television establishment -- and it emerges from the belly of the beast as a weak burp rather than a loud blast -- is no longer, "Is this new gadget going to affect us?" or even "Will this gadget eventually change how Americans watch TV?" but "When this gadget changes how Americans watch television, what else will it change?"
A lot.
The black box obviously does not mean the end of commercial television, only of commercial television as we know it. It poses two questions that demand a response from the television industry. The first is: How do you get people to watch ads when, with the press of a button, they can eliminate them? The sad truth about most popular TV programs is that they are poor vehicles for delivering advertising messages. And the sad truth about ads -- even the ones that cost $3 million to make and win the Golden Lion at Cannes -- is that the people who watch them really didn't ask to see them; people are just too lazy to avoid them. The black box puts an end to that racket. Either the ads will need to become as entertaining as the programs or the programs will need to contain the ads, so that they cannot be stripped out. If Jennifer Aniston wants to remain a Friend, she may need to don a T-shirt that says "Diet Coke."
The basic formula for making and selling TV programs hasn't changed since the beginning of commercial television. The network that develops a new program assumes it can ensure its success by placing it in a desirable time slot, when a lot of people happen to be watching TV. It further assumes that it can pay for it by selling commercial time during that program. The commercials then get flung at whoever happens to be watching at the time. The entire history of commercial television suddenly appears to have been a Stalinist plot erected, as it has been, on force from above rather than choice from below. The networks have coerced, or attempted to coerce, consumers to watch programs and commercials in which they have no native interest. The advertisers who pay for the commercials have agreed to believe, without good evidence, that some meaningful percentage of viewers actually behave in this manner. They have further agreed to believe, again without good evidence, that the sort of people who watch a particular program have a more than ordinary interest in the products advertised on that program. People who enjoy pro basketball are more likely than people who watch soap operas to drink beer; therefore beer companies buy ad time in the middle of pro basketball games.
Against the backdrop of the Internet boom this strikes the newer sparks of the ad and marketing business as terribly retro. "The television advertising business," says Tim Hanlon, a media director at Starcom Worldwide, a large advertising and marketing conglomerate, "is a science based on specious data." That data, generated by Nielsen Media Research, uses a sample of 5,000 homes to determine how many households tune into a given program, not how many watch the ads. "The measurement we use today is very crude," says Daryl Simm, the former head of worldwide media and programming for Procter & Gamble and the current head of media at Omnicom, yet another large advertising and marketing conglomerate. "It's an average measurement of the number of viewers watching an individual program that does not even measure the commercial break. When you think about improvements in measuring viewer habits, you think not about incremental changes but great leaps."
The TiVo and Replay boxes represent the greatest leap of all. They accumulate, in atomic detail, a record of who watched what and when they watched it. Put the box in all 102 million American homes, and you get a pointillist portrait of the entire American television audience. And that raises the second and more disturbing question to which the TV industry must respond: what do you do when you actually know who is watching and why? Already, TiVo and Replay know what each of their users does every second, though both companies make a point of saying that they don't actually dig into the data to find out who did what, that they only use it in the aggregate. Whatever. They know.

HEADLINE: Rustic Retreat on Gitche Gumee

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN; DOUGLAS MARTIN is a reporter on the metropolitan staff of The Times.

 BODY:
LAST September, on a family trip to Longfellow's "shining Big-Sea-Water" -- Lake Superior in Minnesota -- we hiked, bicycled, canoed, sailed, visited historic sites and gobbled lake trout and heavenly homemade doughnuts. We even swam in the icy water.
What made a fine adventure extraordinary was our stay at Naniboujou Lodge. Founded as a private club for the likes of Babe Ruth, Jack Dempsey and Ring Lardner, the rustic 71-year-old building of shingles and glass is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It is on scenic Highway 61, memorialized in the Dylan song. 
 We were intrigued, but were sure Naniboujou was out of our price range. The first of many pleasant surprises was that rooms are $70 to $90 a night. We ended up doing even better with a special deal for families. For $110, we got two cozy, interconnected rooms, each with a small, shower-equipped bathroom (more expensive rooms have larger baths with tubs) and knotty pine furnishings. We would have been happier with a view of the lake, but for a family accustomed to rough-and-tumble housekeeping cottages, we reveled in the fact that our beds were made and rooms thoroughly cleaned each morning.
We arrived on a Sunday evening and after we had finished our first fine meal of lake trout in the vast dining room, our waitress told us the almost full moon would rise around 10.
By the time our sons, Roy, 11, and Guy, 9, were asleep, the moon had changed from a dangling pumpkin to an impossibly large sheer white orb. My wife, Suzanne, and I stood on the shore for a moment, entranced by the broad band of light that paved the rippling "Kitchi-Gami" -- the original Indian term for the greatest lake (Longfellow called it "Gitche Gumee."). I remembered that Guy had pronounced at dinner: "The fun's just starting."
In fact the fun here started a long time ago, though not in the manner intended.
Naniboujou was born in the twilight of the Jazz Age, when nobody imagined that the stock market would soon crash, killing the immense and crazy dreams of a crazy decade. Indeed, for the rich group who banded together in the late 1920's to form an exclusive club of 1,000 men of affluence and achievement on the rocky shores of Lake Superior, the party was just beginning.
A scrapbook of articles and newspaper clippings in the lobby told us of the big plans to turn a virgin forest into a golf course, a dozen tennis courts, a marina for yachts and a clubhouse built from native stone. Celebrities lent their names in return for free membership. Lardner even promised to recommend the club to friends "as soon as I find out how to pronounce it."
The name itself reflected grandiose, if quixotic aspiration. The lakeside retreat was called Naniboujou after the Cree Indian god of the outdoors who ruled the Lake Superior area. Naniboujou fueled great myths: it was he who invented the raspberry and made the blueberry grow in marshy places, not to mention chasing the devil from the North Shore.
So when Naniboujou opened on July 7, 1929, with fireworks, flappers and its very own fable, promoters were already moving on to the next thing -- adding 5,000 acres and a hunting lodge near the Canadian border to the resort's original 3,330. But just four months later came Black Friday, members stopped paying dues, and by the next summer nobody was coming. Only the clubhouse -- today's hotel -- was built. By all rights, Naniboujou should have died then and there.
The club idea did. By 1932, the lodge was open to any paying guest. Then came a succession of uses and owners; it was closed during World War II. Then a family named Wallace owned it for nearly two decades, transforming it into a hotel for families. In 1985, a young couple bought it, determined to carry on the new tradition.
Tim and Nancy Ramey, like the Wallaces, were part of an evangelical Christian organization. They strained mightily to come up with the purchase price, relying on prayer and friends' money. In one sense, they bought far less than the original resort: the more than 3,000 acres across the street had long ago become a magnificent state park with a spectacular waterfall.
Today, just nine acres belong to the resort. But it seems much bigger. There is a quarter mile of beach frontage and a wide lawn with chairs for relaxing. Birch, pine and maple trees rustle in the lake breeze.
Inside, the heart of the resort -- the Great Hall, which is used as the dining room -- is covered in colorful zigzagging designs in a psychedelic marriage of Art Deco and traditional Cree Indian patterns, the original paint from 1929. At one end stands a 20-foot-high fireplace made with 200 tons of rounded Lake Superior rocks. The ceiling is arched to represent the bottom of a canoe.
The Rameys updated the building little by little, adding wood-burning fireplaces in 5 of the 24 rooms, a solarium and a new heating system. They also set policies intended to take guests back to a gentler time: there are no televisions. There is only one VCR, in the solarium, and it is for guests to watch family-type movies or a home video of a really bad storm in 1996. Alcohol, which must be supplied by the guests themselves, is permitted only in guests' rooms. (Ice will be delivered upon request.) Nancy says the couple makes no attempt to evangelize, focusing instead on creating an environment where people "can slow down and enjoy each other."
Usually, all seven Ramey children, ranging in age from 5 to 25, help out in the lodge where four of them were born. Nancy, who bakes all the bread herself, said, "Coming here should be like coming home."
Even in the minds of the original promoters, that was pretty much the idea. "What to do at Naniboujou?" they asked in their ornate brochure. "Live, that's the principal matter."
And so, for a week, we did. We loved the breakfasts of homemade granola, blueberry flapjacks and elaborate egg dishes, as well as the almond-crusted walleye and steak basted with balsamic vinegar at dinner. Afternoon teatime included treats like cucumber sandwiches and white chocolate scones. The Sunday buffet brunch at $10.95 is so sumptuous that when we were there it attracted a crowd of more than 400 or more in a county of just 4,000. Many stood in line outside waiting to get in.
But it is the just-hanging-out stuff that is nicest for a family. Roy loved playing basketball and pitching horseshoes. Guy liked swimming in the chilly water with me. ("Another memory completed," he announced after his first dip.) Suzanne liked to watch the myriad changes in the northern sky from the old-fashioned chair glider swing on the front lawn. We all enjoyed sitting in the solarium where there was an upright piano and sheet music of Cole Porter and Gershwin, Monopoly and other board games and binoculars to observe shore birds.
Unlike the audacious dream of the founders to build a sporting paradise, the equipment available is almost charmingly modest: horseshoes and croquet; strolling along the lake is by far the most popular activity. Kayaks can be rented in nearby Grand Marais and canoes at the many little resorts on the lakes just inland.
In the pleasant solarium library, I kept returning to the Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms. Mushrooms are common in the vicinity, along with wild blueberries, strawberries and raspberries.
THE centerpiece, always, was Lake Superior, the world's largest freshwater lake in surface area. As you look toward the horizon, the water shimmers in bands of four or more colors, ranging from pale gold to the deepest blue. On one shore walk just a little south of Naniboujou, the beach changed from fine gravel to round stones to intricate basalt outcroppings.
Hiking was our favorite activity. There are many nearby trails, some steep, often winding through the birches and, almost always, within earshot of a stream.
Most of our hikes, including the shore walk, were on the Superior Hiking Trail. Extending from Two Harbors, Minn., to Canada, the 200-mile trail was begun in the mid-1980's along the model of the Appalachian Trail. On one three-mile hike on the Kadunce River trail, several miles from Naniboujou, we took time to read some comments from hikers in a notebook kept in an unlocked box near a waterfall. My favorite: "I'm 73 and this country is very beautiful -- but not as beautiful as my wife Dana." -- Bob
Another trip was to Grand Portage National Monument about 30 miles north, near the Canadian border. There we learned of the voyageurs, those intrepid canoeists who fanned out across the northern reaches of North America to create a new economy, and ultimately a new consciousness. Our well-informed guides wore 18th-century costumes and demonstrated boat-building, pie-making and other skills.
Later we hiked up Mount Rose and were rewarded with a lovely view of the fort and the lake -- home, at that moment, to a single sailboat. Next trip, Roy and I plan to hike the Grand Portage -- meaning Great Carrying Place -- along which the voyageurs brought trade goods from one direction and furs from the other. It is more than likely that we will skip the 90-pound load each voyageur carried on the 17-mile round trip.
We made many trips to Grand Marais, a picturesque harbor village 15 miles to the south. The town's slightly quirky sensibility is suggested by the folk art that pops up everywhere: for instance, a fishing tackle store has an enormous lake trout popping through the side of the building.
We loved hanging around the World's Best Donuts, where we feasted on jelly-stuffed doughnuts called bismarks. We saw boats and baskets being built at the North House Folk School and took a sail on the school's schooner Hjordis, a wonderful two-hour trip for $35 a person. I rented a mountain bike at the local bike store, and was given directions for a more than challenging scenic ride on logging roads and snowmobile trails to the west of town.
The people in Grand Marais are remarkably friendly. When our rental car refused to start after dinner one evening, drivers kept offering us a jump. Sue from the local service station drove more than 30 miles out of her way to give us a ride back to Naniboujou.
We figured people in the north country naturally help each other out. Tim Ramey, for instance, had served as a volunteer fireman. In the fall of 1998, a fireplace in a burning house collapsed on him, leaving him paralyzed. He nevertheless mans the phone on Sunday afternoons and is full of plans to upgrade Naniboujou further, beginning with modernizing the kitchen.
It all recalls Naniboujou's mission, as defined in the original brochure of a long-ago club. The idea was to get "back to the beginning of things."
And getting back is our intention. Roy put our names on the list for next year's drawing at the World's Best Donuts, and we will return to see if 2668 turns into our lucky number.

HEADLINE: ART/ARCHITECTURE;
Living Up to the Memories of a Poetic Old Skyline

BYLINE: By HERBERT MUSCHAMP

 BODY:
THIS is a plea on behalf of ethos, the set of cultural values that underlies the forms of artistic expression -- or eidos, if you'll excuse the Sunday morning anthropology lesson I'm about to foist on you. The ethos of ancient Egypt, for example, was theocratic hierarchy. Its eidos was the pyramid. Nice forms, pyramids. Not so nice, the beliefs that gave rise to them. But it's enlightening to know about the beliefs nonetheless.
Decisions are now being made about a cluster of major civic projects that, between them, will exercise an unprecedented impact on the immediate and long-range future of New York. All the projects have an important role to play in meeting the fundamental challenge faced by New York and other aging urban centers: the transition from the industrial city of the 19th century to the cultural matrix of the 21st. The projects are on different scales, and each calls for a different eidos -- a distinctive formal response. But the ethos that should shape these responses is the same: sense of place; historical awareness; an educated view of where history is going; and a receptive state of mind. 
 As of this writing, decisions are imminent on two contested Manhattan sites. They are 2 Columbus Circle, the midtown site now occupied by Edward Durell Stone's Venetian-style campanile, originally designed for Huntington Hartford's Gallery of Modern Art, and the East River waterfront property, just below South Street Seaport, on which the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation proposes to build a museum designed by Frank Gehry. Also in the works are a waterfront park for Brooklyn and a citywide plan designed to attract the 2012 Olympic Games to New York.
Just last spring, it was possible to predict with some confidence that cultural values, in particular architectural values, would play little part in the outcome of these and other civic projects. Rather, the choices would be driven by a combination of economic and political considerations. There was cynical speculation that before heading off to Washington, Rudolph Giuliani (as is often the norm in politics) would directly or indirectly reward his supporters with real estate development plums.
What has changed, of course, is that the mayor will not be heading to Washington. He will presumably not be leaving City Hall before his term runs out. And, because of the mayor's brush with mortality, he is said to be better disposed than formerly to do the right thing. New Rudy or not, this is as good a time as any to talk about good things, and about some of the bad things that prevent good things from happening in architecture -- that prevent the ethos from taking architectural form.
Anyone can make a list of bad things. Mine would include the cultural illiteracy of key decision makers, both in city government and in private civic groups; the notion that the new buildings for cultural institutions can be mere boxes for housing cultural functions; the failure to grasp, therefore, that the cultural responsibility of the container is at least as great as the contained. Not least, one must factor in the interlocking wheels of public relations and private dealmaking that join to bestow vaunted cultural status on utterly worthless buildings.
I want to focus on the Guggenheim project because, of all the plans now pending, it is the eidos that draws most deeply from the New York ethos: the city's open-endedness, its receptivity to change. As such, the project could help shape the standards by which designs for other civic projects should be judged.
Set aside for the moment the particulars of Gehry's design and the global ambitions of Thomas Krens, the Guggenheim Museum's Napoleonic director. Look instead at the landmark that has commanded the East River waterfront, on the Brooklyn as well as the Manhattan sides, for more than a century. Consider the mental as well as the physical landscapes dominated by the Brooklyn Bridge, the bridge's impact on the imagination of citizens, painters and writers, its metaphoric as well as its functional value.
Think about Hart Crane, the great lyric poet of 20th-century New York. Crane's opus, "The Bridge," the democratic ideals symbolized by the bridge and the cultural milieu that supported the expression of those ideals -- these are as finely woven into the Guggenheim's site as the cables that support the bridge's roadbed. Come now, do you really want to see this site submerged beneath the platforms of some river-themed upscale floating hotel? (That is the other plan the city is considering.)
If you live in Brooklyn, you can see the Brooklyn Bridge as Hart Crane thought it should be seen: as a portal from the old world to the new. At once a departure and an approach, the bridge summons up images of things left behind and things as yet untried. It stretches between an ending and a beginning, the familiar and the unknown, hierarchy and equality, ancient customs and freedom from them.
The skyline of lower Manhattan, which Crane photographed from his window at 110 Columbus Heights, was a vision of possibility. Or, as Whitman phrased it more simply two generations before, "The shapes arise!" Together, bridge and skyline were the eidos, the formal expression of ideas the poets put into words.
This is the background against which the Guggenheim project should be seen. While not conventionally contextual, Gehry's design is acutely responsive in formal terms to the lower Manhattan skyline and the riverfront location. It is a tripartite composition, divided horizontally. The public spaces at the base, including an immense skating rink, extend the river surface inland. The steel cloud above is fashioned from titanium ribbons; within are galleries and a central atrium. The cloud appears to be composed of long strips of reflective river surface that have been loosely wrapped, an unstable mass of creative energy. Above that, a 450-foot tower appears to lean slightly to the north, as if awestruck by the skyline's panache.
Nobody can claim that this is a background building. To blend in would be alien to its nature. This is due not only to the formal originality of Gehry's design, but also to the idea animating it. That idea, simply put, is that subjective expression has a critical role to play in architecture at this moment of the city's transition from an industrial to a cultural space.
We are accustomed to subjective treatments of the city in poetry, painting, film, photography, music, fiction and dance. And we bring our own subjectivity to bear when we gaze at the skyline. But we still expect the architects of individual buildings to conform to some imagined objective ideal. Buildings should not be artistic performances. They are not sculpture. They should not be individualistic or, to cite a term that has been misapplied to Gehry, egocentric.
So-called contextualism is the latest version of this prejudice. It restricts architects to the dictates of external authority -- in this case, the forms and scale of neighboring buildings. It denies them the freedom to reckon creatively with the city as it evolves. As a consequence, it prohibits the city itself from becoming the architect's muse.
There is a picture of the man who served as Crane's muse during the time he was writing "The Bridge." His name is Emil Opffer. He is shown standing on the roof of 110 Livingston Street, with the bridge in the background. Opferr himself was a bridge. He enabled this deeply introverted, alcoholic poet to engage with the world in a far more direct, physical way than was possible with his writings alone. Opffer was a bridge toward love and the inspiration that comes from it.
Crane's muse was a merchant seaman, frequently absent, which probably satisfied the poet's need for romantic yearning. And Opferr's roving, maritime life drew the sea into the compass of Crane's mental landscape. It is the sea, not just the East River, that Crane's bridge is always crossing. In 1932, at age 32, Crane drowned himself in its depths.
This is the real context from which Gehry's design springs. The design denies any inherent distinction between architecture and other forms of cultural expression. That denial is based on a sharp historical awareness of the city at this moment. It is not an expression of ego. It reflects a solid grasp of the role architecture ought to play in the cultural city. It, too, is a bridge, a span between past and future. More than a mere monument to itself, the design recaptures the unfamiliarity that the skyline represented for Crane.
Cities are productive places. If they can no longer support industrial production, they must throw their weight behind cultural production. They must look beyond the model of cultural consumption toward a more productive set of conditions. If they remain content to package culture as an inventory of select consumer products, their future will be indistinguishable from that of a suburban mall. Gehry's design points the way out of this fate. The fluid line between our inner and outer worlds -- between the objective and the subjective -- is one of the critical cultural issues of our time. The Guggenheim plan frames this issue more concretely than any New York has seen.
Under Mr. Krens's direction, the Guggenheim has carved out a singular place for itself in the cultural system. The museum's exhibitions are occasions for consumption, but they are also creative productions in their own right. So is the Guggenheim's global network of branches. These are at once centers for culture consumers and components of a larger, creative vision of art as a form of international exchange.
As I think back on the exhibitions mounted during Mr. Krens's tenure, I am struck by how many of them have taken urbanization as their subtext. For example, the present show, "1900," documents the relationship between industrial and cultural production in the era of the great world's fairs. As such, it offers a prehistory of the present moment. "The Great Utopia" and "The Italian Metamorphosis" have also provided historical slices that illuminate the contemporary urban condition.
Mr. Giuliani is said to be a traditionalist. So am I. But New York's most vital tradition is its ethos of change. To represent that enduring ethos, the eidos must change. This is the city's great paradox.
People should not be asking whether Gehry's design fits into the context of lower Manhattan. They should be asking whether New York's new buildings fit into the urban context that Mr. Krens, among others, has been putting together. That context is now global, but in origin it is local. It is New York's gift to modern times.

 CORRECTION:
A picture on Aug. 13, with an article that discussed architectural projects in New York City in relation to the cultural values embodied by the Brooklyn Bridge, was published in error. It showed the poet Hart Crane (not Crane's friend Emil Opffer) standing on the roof of a Brooklyn building where Crane lived. The article also gave two erroneous addresses for the building. It was at 110 Columbia Heights, not 110 Columbus Heights or 110 Livingston Street.

HEADLINE: Drexel Alumni Move Onward

BYLINE: By LAURA M. HOLSON

 BODY:
WHEN Drexel Burnham Lambert filed for bankruptcy in 1990, it was the end of an era in Los Angeles. No other Wall Street firm commanded the attention that Drexel's high-yield bond operation there did as it transformed not only the way that corporate America financed acquisitions but the character of the city as well.
At the time, many of those who worked at Drexel's offices in Beverly Hills wondered whether they would ever work in such a heady environment again. As things turned out, Drexel alumni are all over -- working on Wall Street, running their own investment firms, even comfortably retired, managing the millions of dollars they were paid more than a decade ago. 
 Michael Milken, who masterminded the junk-bond unit, continued to make headlines well after he pleaded guilty in 1990 to violating securities laws and served time in prison. Now Mr. Milken, as a financier-turned-philanthropist, is the chairman of the Milken Institute, which is involved in charities and institutions that finance prostate cancer research and education. He is also the chairman of Knowledge Universe, which invests in Internet concerns; he was a co-founder of the company in 1996.
Gary Winnick, a former senior vice president, has also received much attention lately. He left Drexel in 1985, before it crashed, to start what later became the Pacific Capital Group, an investment firm in Beverly Hills. More recently, he helped found Global Crossing, an cable telecommunications concern that went public in 1998 and now has an eye-popping market capitalization of $23 billion, making Mr. Winnick a multibillionaire.
Off Santa Monica Boulevard in Century City, about a mile from Global's headquarters, are the offices of Apollo Management. Apollo was formed by a group of former Drexel executives, and several are still there. John Kissick, Drexel's former head of corporate finance on the West Coast -- and the man who took over as head of the junk-bond department after Milken left -- is now a senior partner at Apollo. So is Antony Ressler, a senior vice president at Drexel who briefly managed the syndication desk, and Leon D. Black, who works at Apollo Advisors in New York.
Lorraine Spurge, who preceded Mr. Ressler at the syndicate desk, is now a Los Angeles-based adviser for a handful of investment firms and a consultant for, among others, the music producer Quincy Jones.
Ken Moelis, a managing director, left Drexel in 1990, taking nine associates with him down the street to Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, where he is head of corporate finance. Donaldson's Los Angeles office has succeeded Drexel as the most prominent Wall Street firm in the city today.
Not all of Mr. Milken's colleagues ended up in Southern California. Peter Ackerman was Mr. Milken's right-hand man, heading the structured finance unit and helping with the recapitalization of Mellon Bank, among other companies. He is now an executive at Rockport Capital, an investment firm based in Washington, making private investments. He is also co-author of a yet-to-be published book called "A Force More Powerful: A Century of Nonviolent Conflict."
Wall Street executives said Warren Trepp, Mr. Milken's chief bond trader, moved to Lake Tahoe at some point and manages his own capital now. Mr. Trepp could not be reached for comment.
And Dennis B. Levine, the Drexel banker who pleaded guilty to insider trading and started the firm's fall, is now president of the Adasar Group, financial advisers in New York.
There were, of course, many executives who did not work at Drexel but used its financial muscle and played a part in making it an important player in the 1980's. One of the best-known was Thomas Spiegel, the security-conscious former chief executive of the Columbia Savings and Loan Association, which was a big buyer of Drexel-backed junk bonds. He caught the latest business wave and went to work for MP3.com, the San Diego-based Internet music site, in business development. Mr. Spiegel recently left MP3, but remains a consultant, the company said. Mr. Spiegel did not return phone calls seeking comment.

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about the career paths of former executives of Drexel Burnham Lambert referred incorrectly to the Milken Institute, where Michael R. Milken, former head of Drexel's junk-bond unit in Los Angeles, is chairman. The institute is an economic research organization; it is not involved in charities. The Milken Family Foundation, which had Mr. Milken as a co-founder in 1982, is a private charitable organization that supports education and medical research; Cap Cure, founded by him in 1993, is a public charity that supports prostate cancer research.

IT'S not quite the Scopes trial, but a raucous Republican state school board primary election in Kansas this month sent a signal about the place of science in 21st century America, and about how quickly the relationship between science and religion is changing.
In the election, voters defeated those candidates who last year supported removing the mention of evolution from the state science curriculum. The word is expected to be restored after the November school board elections, a significant setback for creationists. 
 Evolution won out in Kansas not because people in this conservative, deeply religious state have grown agnostic. Rather, they believe that science, more than ever, is critical to their children's future and the future of their state. These dot-com times demand scientific knowledge and technical expertise, parents believe, and to lack it is to be left behind.
"There is a realization that we can't have an informed generation if they don't know basic science," said Robert Russell, a physicist and minister who is executive director of the Center for Theology and the Natural Sciences, which is affiliated with the Graduate Theological Union in Berkeley, California. "It's their right, it's their inheritance. Instead of seeing science as an enemy, you see it as a tool."
The idea that Kansas would fall behind academically and economically was one of the principal arguments used by evolution proponents in Kansas. Scientists and school board candidates -- even the governor -- said Kansas would seem embarrassingly backward if the new science standards stayed in place. The lieutenant governor, Gary Sherrer, said that businesses considering relocating to Kansas had been "scared off" out of concern that their employees' children would not be getting a good education and that the work force would not be competitive.
Sue Gamble, who won the primary in a district that includes affluent Kansas City suburbs, said during the campaign that she worried the new science standards could "put students at a disadvantage on a national level" and that "students from out of state won't want to come here and study because they feel the standards won't be up to snuff."
Pro-evolution forces also made overtures of inclusiveness to those who wanted to embrace religion and scientific reasoning. Steve Case, a biologist at the University of Kansas and a leader of the drive to restore evolution to the curriculum, said that he and others brought in speakers like Kenneth R. Miller, a Brown University microbiologist and author of "Finding Darwin's God: A Scientist's Search for Common Ground between God and Evolution."
In his talks, Dr. Miller quoted St. Thomas Aquinas, "who says it's wrong for the religious community to misdescribe how nature works because what it will do is drive people away from religion," Mr. Case said. "That helped clarify for a person in the middle how they could hold a religious view and not have that conflict with science."
Accommodation, national polls suggest, is smart politics. A 1999 Gallup poll found that 68 percent of American adults favored teaching both creationism and evolution in public schools. Another poll, released this year by the People for the American Way Foundation, found that while 83 percent supported teaching evolution in schools, almost half of the respondents said that evolution "is far from being proven scientifically." And 68 percent said it was possible to believe in evolution and that God created humans and guided their development.
"Maybe voters in Kansas didn't see it as an either-or thing," said James F. Moore, a professor of theology at Valparaiso University, who also directs the science and religion workshop at the Zygon Center for Science and Religion in Chicago. "I really do sense that there's a growing trend among common folk to search for how the two areas that are so important to our life can work compatibly together."
Dr. Moore sees that desire in the way that major hospitals and research projects like the human genome project now have ethics panels with religious representatives. And "in religious communities there is an awareness of how important scientific developments have become," Dr. Moore said. "If we don't know what's going on, and we don't know how to interpret what's going on, how can any religious voices really play a role? We will be left behind and not know what we need to know."
That is not to say that the battle between evolution and creationism is over. But the language in which it is fought, especially on the religious right, has changed. Proponents of "intelligent design," for example, assert that the earth is too complex to have been created by random processes. Only some sort of an intelligence could have done it, they say, and they seek to debunk evolution by, for instance, pointing to gaps in the fossil record.
SUCH arguments, which scientists find specious, have been well received in some quarters. Alabama and Oklahoma, for example, have included disclaimers in biology textbooks that raise questions about the certainty of evolution. Kentucky recently eliminated the word "evolution" from its curriculum, substituting the phrase "change over time."
Several other states are debating similar moves. In Arizona and Ohio, bills have been introduced that would require teachers to present evidence for and against evolution, and Mr. Case said he has been contacted by people in Minnesota looking to fend off such a challenge. And dozens of local school boards across the country are considering teaching some form of creationism.
Phillip E. Johnson, a law professor at the University of California who supports intelligent design, said the Kansas episode would only stiffen the spines of evolution opponents to show "that the neo-Darwinian sensibility is intellectually vulnerable."
Yet, as science continues its inexorable progress, some believe that religion must, ultimately, embrace it.
"I don't think the church has been good at this," said the Rev. Christopher Carlisle, an Episcopal priest who co-directs the God and Science Project at Amherst College. "I think it has been self-preservationist, and I think the result of that has been we have been losing people and we have less and less to preserve. An awful lot of the future of the church depends upon the church's welcoming these questions and these conversations."
IF religion ever accepts science fully, some say, the result may well be better and more nuanced the teaching of evolution.
Dick Teresi, a science writer and co-leader of the God and Science Project, says that the fanaticism of creationists has made scientists so defensive that they have lost the critical perspective that is the basis of scientific inquiry.
"Now, you have to believe in evolution as if it were a religion," Mr. Teresi said. "You see evolution being taught in a very teleological way -- this organism is built this way because. This would never happen in physics, where the whole thing is to poke holes in other people's theories. I would teach evolution with all its flaws, and emphasize the randomness. We have to live with the idea that humans are random creatures."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Long Island City, Queens;
Crossing the Queensboro Bridge as a Resettler

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
AS their lease drew to a close at 160-170 Varick Street on the lower west side of Manhattan, executives of Colahan Saunders Corporation, a commercial printing company, knew they were going to have to move. Their landlord, Trinity Church Real Estate, was converting its portfolio of buildings from largely industrial uses to offices, at rents industrial tenants could not afford.
"We saw the handwriting on the wall," said Peter F. Burke, executive vice president of the family-owned concern, which has been in business for more than 100 years. "Trinity was changing its flavor, and we didn't expect our lease to be renewed." 
 After searching for possible locations in the entire metropolitan area, Colahan Saunders settled on the Long Island City section of Queens, buying a building at 47-01 Van Dam Street a few blocks from Queens Boulevard.
With vacancy rates in Manhattan near record lows and rents spiking upward, Long Island City, with its proximity to the heart of the city, good transportation links and sharply lower rents, is functioning as a destination for companies being squeezed out of Manhattan and for those that need space to expand.
The space squeeze in Manhattan is responsible for the blossoming of the Jersey City waterfront on the west side of the Hudson River as companies like Goldman Sachs Group and Chase Manhattan Bank shift back-office jobs to the less costly buildings there. But the Queens area on the eastern bank of the East River has an advantage that the New Jersey location lacks: it is within New York City. For some city residents that can be an important consideration.
"We could have bought a building in New Jersey for half as much as this one, but we would have lost a lot of employees," said Peter D. Colahan, the president of the printing company. Because they stayed in the city, he said, only one of the company's 75 employees declined to make the shift from Manhattan. The fact that so many employees remained helped to keep the operations of a company that runs 24 hours a day running smoothly.
Long Island City has long been an industrial area that also served as a basement for Manhattan, holding warehousing and distribution centers for retailers like Macy's, Bloomingdale's and Gimbels. But now, as office uses are taking the place of factories and warehouses, it is changing.
Jeffrey A. Bernstein, a managing director of Insignia/ESG, a big brokerage and real estate services company, said the situation in Long Island City today is similar to that in Midtown South in Manhattan two decades ago. "I started in Midtown South 20 years ago, taking industrial properties and repositioning them for offices," Mr. Bernstein said. "The same dynamic is at work in Long island City today, and service companies are coming out of Manhattan."
He said he is marketing to office tenants a building at 34-09 Queens Boulevard that was once a factory that made Breyer's ice cream. The asking annual rent in the renovated building is $25 a square foot, about half of what comparable space would cost in Manhattan. Another nearby building, at 32-02 Queens Boulevard, formerly a home to garment manufacturers, is similarly being offered to office tenants.
Despite the savings in real estate costs, he said, the East River remains a barrier to many Manhattan firms, albeit a psychological one, since the area is only a few minutes away from Midtown by subway or the Queensboro Bridge, at 59th Street.
To help overcome that barrier and to avoid getting lost on Queens streets, Mr. Bernstein said, he typically arranges for clients to meet him at Grand Central Terminal and take the subway. "We can be at the buildings within seven minutes," he said.
ONE advantage that Long Island City has over downtown Brooklyn as a location for office development is that it can serve as an adjunct of Midtown rather of downtown Manhattan, said James Meiskin, the president of Plymouth Partners, a tenant's broker. He noted that Midtown Manhattan has roughly 250 million square feet of office space compared with 100 million square feet downtown.
The development of downtown Brooklyn's Metrotech complex was largely driven by Wall Street companies in downtown Manhattan shifting back-office jobs to the Brooklyn location, which is also only a few minutes away by subway. Mr. Meiskin said that Long Island City could become Midtown East, in much the same way Midtown South was transformed earlier.
Long Island City's prospects for development have looked brighter in the past, only to be dimmed by a sharp decline in the Manhattan market. The company then known as Citicorp completed a 50-story, million-square-foot tower there in 1989, but it stands alone today in an area of low-rise loft buildings because the recession that followed the stock market collapse of 1987 made space available at low rents in Manhattan.
One project that was hit hard by the competition from Manhattan was the proposed International Design Center in two renovated factory buildings on Thompson Avenue. It was to have been a center for design companies that could not afford Manhattan rents.
"By the time the buildings became available, the concept never really took off," said Michael A. Barak, who represents a group that recently acquired the property. Renaming it the Queens Corporate Atrium Center, the new managers recently rented 300,000 square feet of space to MCI Worldcom, a telecommunications company.
Mr. Barak said that calls about available space were now coming from companies that do business with MCI Worldcom and from city agencies, such as the Department of Transportation and School Construction Authority, that are also situated there.
The possibility of using low rents to lure tenants out of Manhattan is behind other projects in the area. A group led by Marvin Schnee of Schnee Realty Company in Cedarhurst recently bought a nine-story, 95,000-square-foot building at 42-15 Crescent Street at the foot of the Queensboro Street bridge. The group is renovating the lobby, but the main attraction is to be annual rents in the low $20's per square foot.
"We are looking to get people from Manhattan who are paying $45 to $50 a square foot who like the sound of $25 a square foot," he said.
Some brokers say that the conversion of industrial buildings to office use may be a good thing for the landlords involved but that it is a threat to the warehouse and mechanical companies that have cherished their proximity to Manhattan.
Close to 2 million square feet of industrial space has been converted to offices recently, and industrial rents have doubled in the last 18 months, according to Franklin Zuckerbrot, executive vice president of Sholom & Zuckerbrot Realty, a brokerage company. "Companies that were paying $4 and $5 a foot are now facing $9 to $12 a foot," he said.
One prominent landlord in the area, Irwin Cohen, the chief executive of ATC Management, said that new companies do not necessarily have to drive out industrial tenants. The trick is to combine new skills, such as computer-aided design, with the light manufacturing already in the area.
Mr. Cohen, whose properties include a 10-story, million-square-foot building at 30-00 47th Avenue known as the Factory, said that one of his tenants is a jewelry manufacturer that is planning to bring out a new line of merchandise to be sold directly over the Internet, rather than through retailers or television.
He said software producers could make agreements with the jewelry company not only to assist in designing the new merchandise, but also to help develop the Internet marketing system and Web sites. "They are going to sell directly from the factory to the customer, so their prices can be lower," he said.
New York City is the center of jewelry manufacturing in this country, he said, and developments like this one can help keep it that way. He said the rising rents in Manhattan, where he operates the Chelsea Market complex at Ninth Avenue and 16th Street, will help promote these types of alliances.
"In Long Island City," he said, "you can do manufacturing and e-commerce at the same place."

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY;
A Space Detour for Streaming Internet Traffic

BYLINE: By THERESA FOLEY 

 BODY:
Listening to NetRadio.com's Woodstock 69 music channel or KBAC-FM, Santa Fe's jazz and eclectic radio station, or some other music program over the Internet is gaining popularity among people who spend lots of time online. But delivering simultaneous streams of music to thousands or even millions of listeners over an ever more clogged Internet has become increasingly frustrating. If the audio stream hits too many traffic jams, the listener may find his Internet radio program stuttering or stopping midway through a song.
One promising remedy involves sending the stream up to a satellite, hopping over most of the jam ups on the ground and landing the music stream at a network hub closer to the listener. 
 That is how Viacom's MTV Networks is helping move the feed from SonicNet.com -- one of 18 MTV Web sites -- to the ears of its Internet audience. SonicNet beams its audio stream to the Loral Skynet Telstar 7 satellite from a station in Tulsa, Okla.
The satellite feeds SonicNet's programming to antennas around the country, converting it back to an Internet signal that is distributed to 135 network hubs operated by America Online, Excite@Home and other Internet service providers. Those providers then pass it along through conventional cables or telephone lines to people at their PC's.
"We don't care if it's delivered by satellite, fiber or carrier pigeon; we care about cost," said Nicholas Butterworth, president and chief executive of the MTVi Group, MTV's Internet unit. He made clear, though, that he was still monitoring the results. "So far the satellite service has proven valuable," Mr. Butterworth said, "but over the long term, who knows?"
MTVi is using competing ground-based distribution services from companies like Akamai Technologies and Digital Island to improve the reception of its Internet music and video programs.
The iBeam Broadcasting Corporation, which provides the satellite service to MTVi, said it had signed up 250 Internet content providers the last nine months, since it started operating its network of satellites and fiber to bypass traffic jams on the terrestrial Internet.
Entertainment and news providers like MSNBC Cable News, another iBeam customer, want to see their Web content delivered to users in the fastest, most efficient way possible and are willing to pay for such service. IBeam charges the companies monthly fees of $4,600 or more.
IBeam, which had a public stock offering in May, reported a loss of $33.1 million for the second quarter on revenue of $3.4 million. The company has several competitors that offer -- or plan to offer -- satellite service as a way for Internet content companies to rise above the network fray.
For several years, some overseas Internet service providers have used satellite links as a way to connect to the United States' Internet backbone. But the use of satellite distribution by American Web content companies as a way to gain speed and efficiency is still a new business, though it is an approach similar to the way cable and broadcast TV networks have distributed programming to cable operators and local stations for more than two decades.
IBeam and its rivals, including Cidera, InterPacket and NetSat Express, contend that the Internet is a hostile network environment for streaming media, the Internet term for video and audio that is viewed or heard as it is transmitted, rather than being received and stored on the user's PC before being played.
"The Internet was not designed to do what we're asking it to do -- to distribute something that looks like TV or sounds like a CD," said Peter B. Desnoes, iBeam's chief executive. He notes that a three-minute video stream requires a total data transfer of nearly 10 million bytes -- roughly 800 times more than a typical Web page.
"The way to solve it is to go around the Internet itself," Mr. Desnoes said. "We have built a very complex private network that includes satellite elements that sends content out to the edge."
The public Internet architecture is simply not designed to handle large audiences of simultaneous users who, for example, might tune into Internet Webcasts. Nor are the built-in backup systems. If a few packets of data are lost in the transmission of an e-mail message or a Web page, the Internet's software automatically finds them and replaces them. But in the case of a video transmission, resending packets to replace lost data can make for a choppy picture.
For video traveling from a single point to many, "nothing beats satellite," said Robert Fagin, Internet, infrastructure and services analyst at Bear, Stearns.
Bear, Stearns forecasts a $48 billion market for streaming media by 2010, up from $1.3 billion today, with perhaps 30 percent of the flow being delivered by third-party service providers -- whether satellite players or companies that offer land-based route-around solutions.
Cidera, a satellite-delivery company based in Laurel, Md., predicts that audience demand for streaming media will be so strong that content providers and Internet service companies alike will be willing to pay companies like Cidera to ensure a smooth and steady flow of streaming media.
Ramachandran Viswanathan, Cidera's vice president for marketing, said Internet service providers recognized that "streaming media is like a tsunami wave about to break on them."
Even when people have high-speed Internet connections like the DSL service available through telephone companies, they can find that streaming media can be slowed or disrupted by bottlenecks on the Internet, said Bill Collatos, a venture capitalist.
Mr. Collatos is a founding managing general partner of Spectrum Equity, a $3 billion firm in Boston that has invested in Orblynx Inc. of Fairfax, Va., a company that, with the help of Intelsat, has developed technology for distributing Internet content by satellite.
For the public, investment opportunities are still limited. IBeam shares were offered at $10 in May, and reached nearly $28 in early June, before falling back. They closed at $10.1875 on Friday.
Cidera, InterPacket and NetSat Express have all registered for public offerings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, but have not set dates for proceeding. Meanwhile, competition is on the way from several big, established satellite companies, including Intelsat and PanAmSat, which are putting their own Internet-content delivery networks into service.
IBeam appears to be ahead of the others in its service concept, which goes beyond delivery and includes flourishes like adding other material to the information stream. For MTVi, for example, iBeam can insert advertising into the live streams, tailored to individual subscribers.
"If you are a cat owner, you will get a cat commercial," Mr. Desnoes said. "We provide those services."
The economics of the business models are still to be proved by iBeam and the other start-ups, which lease satellite capacity rather than operate their own spacecraft.
Roger Stanyard, the principal consultant at the British firm DTT Consulting, has studied use of satellites with the Internet for more than three years. He said the most that a company like Cidera could expect to charge an Internet service provider was $250 a month -- a figure that he said in some cases might not cover the cost of providing the service. "It becomes difficult to get your money back," Mr. Stanyard said.
But Mr. Collatos, the venture capitalist, remains guardedly optimistic about the Internet satellite companies. "All are early stage and they will miss their plans; it's inevitable," he acknowledged. "But fundamentally, the concept they have is sound."

The Internet in Japan is riding a wireless wave, leaving phone-line companies in the dust.

BYLINE: By John Markoff 

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
TO understand how different the development of the Internet has been in Japan than in the United States, consider the plight of Hiroaki Kobayashi.
A veteran telecommunications entrepreneur who started one of the first modem companies in Japan and then sold it to AT&T, Mr. Kobayashi is now the president and founder of Tokyo Metallic, a struggling Japanese provider of high-speed, or broadband, Internet access lines. 
 His company is trying to jump start the development of a type of broadband telephone-line technology known as digital subscriber line, or DSL. But while Internet access through DSL is booming in the United States, Mr. Kobayashi's business is barely sputtering. There are fewer than 1,000 DSL customers in Japan, split between his company and one lone competitor.
In the United States, the incumbent Bell phone companies and their start-up competitors, known as CLEC's, are now closing in on a million DSL subscribers nationally, according to the Cahners Instat market research group. And Internet access by high-speed cable television lines is quickly reaching even higher numbers in the United States.
But here in Japan, Tokyo Metallic's tiny band of entrepreneurs is facing many obstacles, not the least of which is the giant Japanese telephone company Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, which currently has a competing strategy for wiring Japan with high-speed fiber optic cables.
Moreover, the Japanese telephone industry invested heavily in an early version of a digital technology known as ISDN -- a type of phone service much slower than DSL and only slightly faster than modem data sent over a standard, analog phone line that many people in the United States still use for Internet access.
Although NTT has recently made overtures to the American DSL companies, industry executives said that the telecom giant was in no rush to invest in DSL -- in part because it is still anxious to retrieve its investment in ISDN.
For all the landline forces working against him, though, the biggest challenge to Mr. Kobayashi's vision of wiring Japan has nothing to do with wires at all. Just the opposite, in fact. The Japanese are heading onto the Internet in droves -- by wireless means.
Currently, according to InfoCom Research, there are between 20 million and 27 million Internet users in Japan, or approximately one of every five people in the nation. Of that number, nearly half -- some 10 million -- are connecting to the Internet wirelessly. Of these wireless customers, 7.5 million are using a service called i-mode, offered by NTT DoCoMo, NTT's wireless division. For nearly two of three i-mode users, this wireless link is their only method of access to the Internet.
InfoCom forecasts that the percent of Japanese population connected wirelessly to the Internet will increase to more than 85 percent by 2003, compared with only about 60 percent connected by fixed-line networks.
That trend suggests that people here are likely to use and experience the Internet much differently than they do in the United States, where so far only a fraction of Internet users have wireless access.
Japan's wireless Internet explosion was set off last year by the introduction of NTT DoCoMo's i-mode cellular phones, which are capable of sending and receiving data. And now competing with the i-modes are an increasingly popular type of cellular phone known as PHS that supports data speeds of 64,000 bits a second -- as fast as the wired, ISDN digital phone lines here.
What's more, Japan is now moving quickly to a second generation of wireless Internet technology, which promises higher data speeds and a variety of location-sensing commercial services that are likely to be embraced by business customers.
But this is far more than a business revolution. One has only to sit in a Japanese subway car watching teenagers communicating via the Internet cell phones, or wander the stores of the Akihabara, Tokyo's electronics district, where there are literally hundreds of different voice, data and data-voice handset models on display, to grasp the momentum of the wireless Net in Japan.
In advertisements and in interviews, Keiji Tachikawa, chief executive and president of NTT DoCoMo, has been sketching out his vision of a next-generation digital cellular network to be initiated early next year, when DoCoMo plans to offer five types of wireless Internet access devices that will further blur the line between cell phones and computers.
It is a prophecy that has led many observers of the Internet in Japan to conclude that the wired world may increasingly become an afterthought for most Internet users here.
"Japan is more mobile and less people are home," said Joichi Ito, an Internet pioneer in Japan who now heads Neoteny, a Tokyo-based Internet business incubator. "Most people don't have living rooms here, and wiring is very high-cost."
There are also other cultural factors that explain the wireless versus wired split. Andrew Seybold, an American wireless expert who visited here this summer to study the Japanese wireless market, points to a variety of reasons that the wireless Internet has taken faster, firmer root in Japan than in the United States: better wireless coverage, pricing on par with prices for wired service and the fact that for many people, particularly teenagers, the wireless phone is their only phone.
Mr. Seybold also noted the strong cultural factors that have driven the success of the i-mode phone in Japan, particularly popular "killer applications," like train schedules, wireless banking and games.
Japanese designers seem to have understood the user interface issues in a way that American designers have not, Mr. Seybold said. "In Japan you can get to the train schedule with two clicks," he said. "When I try to find a plane flight on a U.S. cell phone, I have to go through seven menu levels before I can even enter the flight number."
One likely consequence of the diverging approaches to the Web is that Japan, and by extension Asia, may be reaching the next generation of the Internet far sooner than the United States.
Whether that means that the next generation of technology innovation and competitive advantage will follow the Web westward across the Pacific Ocean remains to be seen. Meanwhile, Hiroaki Kobayashi can only hope that Tokyo Metallic doesn't become completely swamped by the wireless wave.

HEADLINE: Murdoch Deal Could Revamp New York TV

BYLINE: By BILL CARTER and GERALDINE FABRIKANT 

 BODY:
Media analysts and network executives said over the weekend that the sale of TV stations owned by Chris-Craft Industries to the owner of the Fox network, the News Corporation, was likely to create a host of opportunities for the News Corporation -- and raise almost as many questions.
The questions will affect the News Corporation and Viacom, which until Friday had also been bidding to acquire the stations. 
 The sale, expected to be announced formally this week, is valued at $85 a share, or about $3.5 billion. It will add 10 stations owned by Chris-Craft and present the News Corporation's leader, Rupert Murdoch, with a competitive edge -- ownership of two powerful TV stations in a number of major cities, including New York and Los Angeles. It will also give him extended control over dissemination of local news in New York, where he would own both Channel 5 and Channel 9 as well as The New York Post.
The deal, however, raises questions about how the News Corporation will deal with current Federal Communications Commission restrictions. They include a limit on how much reach one broadcasting company can attain and a ban on cross-ownership of newspapers and TV station in the same city, which Mr. Murdoch won a waiver for when only Channel 5 was involved.
The deal especially throws into question what may happen to UPN, which is now owned by Viacom but will become the Paramount Network in January.
No network has ever succeeded without owning stations in the two largest media markets of New York and Los Angeles. Viacom, which also owns CBS, finds itself in the position of running a network whose two biggest stations will be owned by a company that also owns a rival network. And the affiliation agreement between the Chris-Craft stations and the Paramount network expires in January.
Some network executives are already predicting the Viacom president, Mel Karmazin, will simply decide that the UPN Network, now losing between $100 million and $150 million a year, is an asset not worth keeping. Faced with some CBS cable TV assets that had little prospects of turning a profit in the next five years, the Eye on People channel and Tele-Noticias, Mr. Karmazin chose to shut down both of them.
But the UPN Network had shown recent signs of growth, having found a hit in a weekly wrestling franchise. One media analyst said that Mr. Karmazin, in recent private conversations, said "UPN will be profitable in a year."
"He was very much of a mind to keep it," the analyst added.
Whether that will still be true with the News Corporation owning the most important stations broadcasting the network is far from certain. But the analyst, who spoke on condition of anonymity, cautioned against any facile predictions that Mr. Karmazin will quickly pull out of UPN.
"There are too many advantages to owning two networks," the analyst said. "You could put a CBS News nightly newscast at 10 p.m. on the alternate network and amortize so much more of the costs of an expensive news division. You can cross-promote to your second network when your main network may have a show that has a totally different appeal."
It is similar opportunities on the local level presented by dual ownership of stations in the same city that are at the center of News Corporation's plans for the Chris-Craft stations. Michael J. Wolf, who heads the media department at Booz Allen & Hamilton, said: "There are cross-promotions that can take place, similar to the way that companies are able to drive viewers from one cable network to another. The same thing can work in local television markets."
Two stations in the same city can also achieve great economies of scale, Mr. Wolf said, by combining news operations and advertising sales staffs. "This would let News Corp. get a bigger piece of an advertiser's budget," Mr. Wolf said. And it could open up possibilities in sports, he added, by allowing the News Corporation to place a team's games on two channels. For example, Channel 5 carries Yankees games. But because that is the flagship station of the Fox network there are many nights when Fox cannot pre-empt entertainment programming for a game. Now it might be possible to move some games over to Channel 9.
Dual ownership is certain to be most noticed in New York because of Mr. Murdoch's ownership of The Post. Presumably he will have to gain an additional waiver from the F.C.C. to add Channel 9 if he intends to retain The Post because of the continuing restriction on cross-ownership of newspapers and stations.
But Fox will be much more aggressive in seeking to overturn another F.C.C. restriction, the one that limits a broadcasting company to owning stations that reach no more than 35 percent of the nation's homes. Fox was already at that cap before this acquisition. With the Chris-Craft stations, the network will be far above the cap. Fox has already filed suit in federal court to challenge the regulation and analysts and executives said this weekend that Fox would surely step up its lobbying efforts in Congress to have the limits either raised or eliminated.
Even if the restrictions stay in place, Fox is not likely to simply sell off stations to get down to the limit. "You may see a lot of station swapping take place," a Fox executive said. Another network executive compared what might take place to "a game of go fish, where you take one card and I take another." The point of the game: match up stations and cities to create dual ownership.
But all this presumes that owning stations will continue to be good business, a point many broadcast executives disagree on. One senior executive with experience at two networks said many family-owned companies with long histories running TV stations had recently decided to quit the business, sensing that the future was too unpredictable. "It's not like by adding Channel 9, you now have two of seven stations in New York. With all the cable channels out there, it means you have two of 100."
Most recently, one News Corporation acquisition, the Family Channel, which Mr. Murdoch bought for $1.9 billion in 1997, has struggled to find an identity and to make money.
Still, David Londoner, a media analyst with ABN Amro, said there was a prospect that coming digital technology would expand the reach of local stations by multiplying their signals from one channel to as many as four. "More channels in big cities? You should be able to do something with that," he said.

Ford Releases Data on Tires That Firestone Recalled
Ford Motor released documents showing that Bridgestone/Firestone had received for years an unusually large number of claims on the tires that were recalled last week.
The highest numbers of claims by a wide margin were for tires produced at Bridgestone's factory in Decatur, Ill., in 1994 and 1995, when the factory was operated by replacement workers. Until now, Ford and Firestone sought to present a united front. But several disclosures indicate that their relationship is being strained by the tire recall. Page A1. 

Venture to Offer Video-on-Demand
Intertainer and Akamai Technologies plan to announce a partnership today to deliver video-on-demand to the computers of consumers with high-speed Internet connections. The service, which is now available in Cincinnati and Denver, will be broadly available by the end of the year, the companies said. C5.
 
Jobs Finds Fault With New Book
"The Second Coming of Steve Jobs," a book by Alan Deutschman, portrays Steven P. Jobs, the co-founder and chief executive of Apple Compute, as an abusive, insecure narcissist who, through a "reign of terror," turned around the company and reclaimed his authority. Last week, Mr. Jobs called the chief executive of Random House, the publisher's parent, to complain about the book, referring to it as a "hatchet job." C9.
 
NBC Joins the Reality Show Fray
After a long delay, NBC will announce this week that it has acquired the rights to "Chains of Love," a reality show that will chain four men to one woman for a week. NBC has also acquired the rights to a hidden-camera show called "Sweet Revenge," in which a contestant will be offered a chance to get back at a friend or family member by setting him or her up for embarrassment on a hidden camera. C9.
 
A Space Detour for Web Traffic
Delivering simultaneous streams of music to thousands or even millions of listeners over an ever more clogged Internet has become increasingly frustrating. If the audio stream hits too many traffic jams, listeners may find radio programs stuttering or stopping in the middle of a song. One promising remedy involves sending the stream up to a satellite and landing it at a network hub closer to listeners. C4.
 
Networks' Convention Role Shrinks
The three main broadcast networks are likely to continue to play a role at political conventions, and the parties are likely to continue to covet every moment on these high-visibility networks. But the scaling back in prime time that occurred this year is expected to only intensify the next time. Media. C9.
 
Japan Heads to Web Without Wires
While Internet access through high-speed lines is booming in the United States, the business in Japan is barely sputtering. The Japanese are heading onto the Internet in droves -- but by wireless means. There are at 20 million to 27 million Internet users in Japan, or one of every five people in the nation. Of that number, nearly half are connecting to the Internet wirelessly. New Economy. C4.
 
Web Entrepreneurs Stepping Aside
Anecdotal evidence suggests that a changing of the guard is under way in the Internet industry, as the early proponents of the Web are stepping aside for the mainstream business people who have migrated to the new medium. Analysts say the executive shift could have broad implications for e-commerce.Bob Tedeschi: E-Commerce Report. C7.

Bill's Third Acceptance

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: HOLLYWOOD

 BODY:
My Fellow Democrats:
After that rousing eight-minute demonstration, I accept your love. I accept your appreciation for triangulating you out of the Carter-Mondale-Dukakis wilderness and back into the White House for eight glorious years. And were it not for that damnable two-term amendment the Republicans put through to get even with F.D.R., tonight I would be saying, "I accept your renomination!" 
 That's how I'd like to start my valedictory speech. And then there are a few other things I wish I could say.
On the contrition business, I'd like to tell Bush and Cheney where to get off with all their barbs about "restoring honor and dignity" and other code words condemning my private life. But that line of attack from me would play into their hands.
So I'll choke back my feelings and pretend to be grateful to Joe Lieberman for calling me to moral account on the Senate floor. That'll get a big hand; we can't let the Pat Robertson crowd out-God us. And at least Joe voted right on acquittal.
I showed the other day how I can smother my detractors with gratitude. My best line to my pastor in Illinois: "If I hadn't been knocked down the way I was, and forced to come to grips with what I'd done and the consequences of it in such an awful way, I might not ever have had to really deal with it 100 percent." Thank you, Ken Starr and Henry Hyde, for forcing me to deal with it. Beautiful.
And the convention will tear the place apart if I thank the two-thirds of the American people for sticking by me in my toughest time. My personal purging process is not a subject Al wants me to touch on at a convention that is supposed to be all about him, but I know what's best for me. And what's best for me is best for him because this election is about me.
I won't let on about that, of course; I have to say every election is about the future. But I'll look back, bragging on the good times, claiming my tax increase in '93 was responsible for all the prosperity and surpluses today. I'll blame the Democrats' loss of the House on that unpopular party-line vote, even though everybody in the hall who lost will know the reason was our health-care fiasco.
My theme will be the tried-and-true "You Never Had It So Good," backed up with a pile of facts and figures -- 22 million jobs! Crime down! Stock market up! -- followed by the fearsome "Don't Let Them Take It Away." Look, maybe we had nothing to do with prosperity, but if we were in a depression, who would be getting the blame?
Looking into my own soul, I confess I'm torn. The good part of me wants Al Gore to win because it would validate my eight years and show the American people saying, "We want to give Bill Clinton a third term." On the other hand, the bad boy in me wants him to lose, to show the Democrats how much they needed me personally to drag them in and keep them in.
Even more conflicted are my feelings about Hillary's New York bid. I want her to win because I owe her for all that forgiving and because she's a backup for my validation in case Al can't make it without me. But my bad side says if she loses, she'll realize who the only winner is in this family. Plus which, she wouldn't be able to get on her high horse and have all that fun in the Washington I brought her to.
No -- get thee behind me, Satan -- I want Hillary to beat that pushover unknown, really I do. For six years, ever since her health-bill fiasco, we've been assuring everybody she hasn't been affecting presidential policy, especially about the Palestinians. But the new line is that the opposite was true, that she was deeply involved in all sorts of big decisions. Look, whichever she wants -- strictly first lady or co-president -- I can teach it either way.
So I'll stand up there for my Third Acceptance and wow 'em by taking full credit for everything good that's happened in eight great years. Let Al play Mr. Nice Guy if he likes; I'll be that old lovable rogue who can make a centrist waffle look like red meat. I'll make the Democrats miss my charm. I'll scare the viewers with the prospect of Bush, backward economics and back-alley abortions, and I'll stupefy my enemies with great globs of gratitude.
Clinton fatigue? Not when I'm finished. Tonight is the first night of Clinton nostalgia.

 BODY:
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas this weekend defended the generous retirement package that his running mate, Dick Cheney, received from his former employer as a standard practice for a company executive.
But senior Democrats today derided Mr. Bush, the Republican presidential nominee, for standing behind the settlement when the Republican-led Congress has resisted increasing the minimum wage. 
 After accepting Mr. Bush's offer to join him as the vice-presidential candidate, Mr. Cheney resigned as chairman and chief executive of the Halliburton Company, a Dallas-based energy services company. Halliburton awarded him a financial settlement worth an estimated $20 million after five years of service during which he received about $12.5 million in pay and stock options currently worth $39 million.
In an interview with The Los Angeles Times that was published today, Mr. Bush said he was aware that Mr. Cheney would receive a retirement package, as any successful chief executive would. Mr. Bush said: "I think what you ought to do is ask, 'Does the board of directors know what they are doing? Are they expert? And let the experts make the decision as to what's fair.' "
Chris Lehane, a spokesman for Vice President Al Gore, said the size of the retirement package and Mr. Bush's approval reflects the close relationship between the Republican Party and big business that working families might find troublesome.
Dirk Vande Beek, communications director for Mr. Cheney, said critics were making too much of the matter, "especially when no one complained about the $200 million compensation package Bob Rubin got after leaving Goldman-Sachs."
Juleanna Glover, press secretary for Mr. Cheney, said Halliburton planned to disclose details of the retirement package on Wednesday. Details of the package Robert E. Rubin received after leaving the firm he headed to become chairman of President Clinton's National Economic Council in 1992 could not be independently confirmed.

HEADLINE: Some Progress in Phone Strike, But Agreement Proves Elusive

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO 

 BODY:
A quick end to the strike by more than 86,000 employees of Verizon Communications, the nation's largest telecommunications employer, appeared out of the grasp of negotiators yesterday after unions rejected parts of the company's latest proposal.
Verizon made a new contract offer at 1 a.m. yesterday that did not overcome the unions' objections. 
 "It is old wine in new bottles," said Robert Master, a spokesman for the Communications Workers of America, which represents the majority of the striking workers.
The communications workers' union and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, which represent Verizon employees in 12 Eastern states and Washington, D.C., are still at odds with the company on issues like mandatory overtime, stress levels and the movement of work resulting from Bell Atlantic's $72 billion acquisition of GTE, which formed Verizon.
Still, progress was made in establishing a framework for a contract for several dozen employees of Verizon's wireless unit. And both sides agree that perhaps the main stumbling block was overcome last week in an understanding that would allow unions to organize more easily at Verizon Wireless.
If anything, the strike illustrates an effort by organized labor to find its footing in the high-technology industries that are reshaping the economy. Instead of wages and benefits, the main objectives of the strike involve an effort to gain a union foothold in new areas and secure concessions for a work force weary of long hours and the concern that mergers might translate into fewer jobs.
Optimism over Verizon's concession in the wireless area gave way over the weekend to feelings among negotiators that a fast resolution to the strike, which is entering its ninth day, has become more remote.
The main difference remaining between the two sides concerns the movement of work resulting from the Bell Atlantic-GTE merger.
The unions are seeking to limit the movement of jobs or tasks by agreeing on a flat percentage of Verizon's work force of 260,000 employees that would be subject to such movement, similar to the half a percentage point agreed upon with Bell Atlantic after it bought Nynex in 1997.
Verizon, though, wants a more flexible agreement that would limit movement of work by measuring it in net additions or subtractions within a given region.
In one part of Verizon's offer, the company proposed limiting the number of employees who could transfer from stressful jobs at call centers to other parts of the company. The unions said this proposal would actually make matters worse, but the company said it was only part of the way it would address the issue.
In addition, the union reiterated concern over Verizon's move to expand in the high-speed Internet access business by acquiring NorthPoint Communications. Verizon told the unions that about 300 union-represented jobs would be shifted into the NorthPoint operation, but details involving the outsourcing of related tasks remained blurry, a person close to the talks said.
Although an overall agreement is within reach, both sides acknowledged that little progress was made over the weekend. If the walkout drags on, the communications workers' union said it would start using its $400 million strike fund on the 15th day of the strike. The fund would pay its members $200 a week, which would rise to $300 a week if the strike were to last a month.
Verizon said it had 90,000 repair requests yesterday, up from about 80,000 during most days last week, although the company attributed the increase to rainstorms that knocked out service in parts of several Eastern states. Meanwhile, the number of pickets thinned to about 750 yesterday, down from the thousands at Verizon sites each day last week.

HEADLINE: Destin Journal;
New Economy Eclipses A Sliver of Old Florida

BYLINE: By RICK BRAGG 

DATELINE: DESTIN, Fla., Aug. 11

 BODY:
The sand dunes of Okaloosa Island, like snowbanks, line both sides of U.S. Highway 98 between Fort Walton and Destin, and they are so pretty that people weave off the road, looking at them. The golden sea oats waft in the summer breeze, and gnarled pines, blasted by hurricanes that hit or barely missed, lean from sand so purely white that the sun flashes off it like a mirror and hurts the eyes.
To the south, beyond the dunes, is the Gulf of Mexico, an emerald green when the sun is out and a deep, deep blue on cloudy days. And across the spit of the sand, to the north, is a wide bay, its water darker, a place where wading birds prowl the shallows, spearing fish and crabs. 
 But at 55 miles an hour, this three-mile stretch of protected, mostly undeveloped federal land flashes past in an instant. In the amount of time it takes a tourist to tune his car radio, the little oasis is gone.
And looking around at what has become of the rest of this part of the Florida Panhandle on each side of that stretch of sand, part of Eglin Air Force Base, it is enough to make some visitors wonder if what they saw was even real.
Concrete condominiums, as imposing as anything in Miami or Fort Lauderdale, line the beachfront on both ends of this paradise, blocking views of the Gulf. Tower cranes in the distance promise more.
Thick traffic on 98 moves like syrup on a cold day, and turning left against the gridlock, to one of the gigantic new seafood emporiums that look almost like amusement parks with their expanse of neon, can be hair rending. The real estate people have a term for this kind of growth: "Turning sand into money."
Fort Walton, to the west, is "built out," the locals like to say, but to the east, at Destin and beyond, the building boom is still raging. Destin, which had long been regarded as one of the last little jewels of coastal old Florida, has been transformed into a coastal city of condominiums.
"We have been discovered," said Commissioner Nick Nicholson of Okaloosa County.
It didn't happen overnight, it just seems like it to people who come only every few years. The Panhandle has been a prize for developers for decades. Destin, once known as the World's Luckiest Fishing Village, has been growing and changing for years.
Now the village is gone, at least the village that older people here remember.
The fishing is no longer so lucky.
"It's kind of heartbreaking to see it turn into a concrete jungle," said Dewey Destin, 47, great-great-grandson of the town's founder, Leonard Destin.
"It's a bittersweet feeling," said Mr. Destin, a part-owner of Destin Seafood Market and a city councilman since 1985. "There are more jobs, and the properties are worth more money.
"And it has destroyed our community. It has destroyed the local natural fishery. We now have much dirtier water. But this is what you get when you exchange nature for economic well-being."
People used to saunter across 98 in their bathing suits. Now, they wait for a break in the traffic, and run as if a mean dog were after them.
"If I had a choice, I would have restricted the development to have low density," said Mr. Destin, who points out that most zoning during the early boom years was handled by the county, not the city. "I would have done it much differently."
The population statistics show growth, but do not show the true changes in Destin and the surrounding coast. In 1970, the population of Okaloosa County was 88,188, according to state statistics. By 1990, it had climbed to 143,776, and by 1999 it had climbed to almost 180,000.
But the tourists and the part-time residents have truly altered the landscape, real estate figures show.
In 1990, there were 194 sales of new condos in southern Okaloosa County, which includes Destin, and in rapidly developing southern Walton County, to the east.
In 1999, there were 937 sales of new condos, many of which will be vacant for part or even much of the year, or leased to tourists.
The boom shows no sign of stopping. Sales of condos and town houses here almost doubled in just the past year.
Real estate developers say Destin and much of the rest of the Florida Panhandle have become a playground of the new, fat economy.
"Because of the boom, baby boomers and e-commuters are purchasing places as second homes or working from their homes here," said Dave W. Hubbard, a broker. "The younger generations are getting their money early on and coming to play on the water. Condos are starting at $300,000 and going to $1.4 million. That's about average for a Gulf view."
Some residents say it had to happen sooner or later, and make no excuses for the transformation.
"We knew that we weren't going to be able to keep this beauty secret for a long time," said Michael Beaubien, who owns Born to Boogie Charter Boat Fishing. "How could we put a fence around us and say, 'No, get out'?"
"Developers are not going to sit there and say, 'We'll take care of this land and leave it as a habitat for the redheaded woodpecker,' " Mr. Beaubien continued. "It's just not realistic to think that."
But people who loved it for what it was hate what it is.
"Storm water runoff has affected the bay, and all the fertilizers they put on the golf courses are killing it," said Jacquelyn L. Tatjes, a secretary at Sexton's Seafood, a place where locals and tourists have gone for years to get fresh shrimp and crabs to boil.
Ms. Tatjes has lived here 25 years, after fleeing the building booms in California. Here it is, she said, all over again.
"There's no way a local can even go to the beach," she said. "They say there's public access, but there's no parking. You can't even see the beach anymore."
And the new people have no connection to the place, beyond their time-share agreement or deed, longtime locals say.
"They're rude. Instead of accepting our heritage of a small town, they just want to change it," Ms. Tatjes said. "They want it to be just like where they came from. It's lost all its charm."
As soon as the value of her property peaks, she said, she is moving.
Others have already left.
Evan Bergwall is now a senior vice president at a bank in Neosho, Mo., a small city outside Joplin. Mr. Bergwall and his family left Destin this year, for good, after living here 10 years. "What I went there for disappeared," he said.
"As a place to get away," he said, "it isn't, anymore."
Like some exotic animal in a cage, the undeveloped stretch of land between Destin and Fort Walton is fenced off on the Gulf side. But people regularly cross the fence, climb the dunes and look at the water, and run or roll back down them.
They commit a small disobedience, just to see what, once, this was all like.

HEADLINE: A Small Case Of Identity Crisis;
Overlooked Rockland Divides Over Question Of Growth vs. Quiet Charm

BYLINE: By WINNIE HU 

DATELINE: RAMAPO, N.Y., Aug. 12

 BODY:
Upstate New Yorkers think of Rockland County as downstate, while downstate New Yorkers think of it as upstate, if they think about it at all. Many know it simply as the first rest stop after crossing the Tappan Zee Bridge: Rockland, New Jersey.
At just 176 square miles, Rockland is the smallest county in the state (after the five boroughs of New York City) and one that is often slighted because of its precarious foothold west of the Hudson River above New Jersey. Even some of its own residents say that Rockland is just the county that you have to go through to get somewhere else. 
 Yet geography is only partly to blame for this identity crisis. Although Rockland has pockets of wealth, it has never wielded the political muscle of Nassau, or enjoyed the same cachet as Westchester, its better-known neighbor across the Hudson. It has never produced a governor, and its most honored native, James A. Farley, the postmaster general under President Franklin D. Roosevelt, moved to Manhattan and was buried in Westchester. "It's another thing to be chagrined about," said Thomas F. X. Casey, the Rockland County historian.
Now, an increasing number of Rockland's citizens are seeking recognition and respect through a surge of civic activism: protests, town meetings, even bold threats to withhold tax money from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority if more local trains and buses are not provided. But at the same time, many other citizens are fighting to preserve the serene landscape and quiet charm that have long defined their county. Like so many places in the Hudson River Valley, Rockland seems caught between two contradictory impulses as it tries to decide whether it is ready for a larger role in the world and the headaches that come along with growth and visibility.
"There are people who preferred when Rockland was forgotten," said Craig H. Long, a police detective and historian for the town of Ramapo. "They were content, and didn't seek that recognition, because it was like a well-kept secret here. When you open up the county, you invite more problems. Some residents feel the worst thing that ever happened was the Tappan Zee."
Rockland -- the name is thought to have been inspired by the rocky soil -- was carved out of Orange County more than two centuries ago by British colonists and thrived for a time as an outpost for shipbuilders and manufacturers. But most of the county remained farmland until the Tappan Zee Bridge was built in 1955. "The opening of the Tappan Zee changed everything," said Mr. Casey, the county historian. "It changed Rockland from a semirural, sleepy county to a much larger county."
Nearly two-thirds of the county is now covered with industries, subdivisions and roads, while much of the rest has been preserved as parks or open space. In the past fiscal year, those industries created 3,100 new jobs, mainly in services and sales. This gave Rockland the second-highest job growth rate in the state, after Putnam County. Most of Rockland's citizens earn a comfortable living; the median income for a family of four is $82,400 a year, compared with $56,200 in New York City.
Yet desspite its growing affluence and visibility, Rockland continues to be dwarfed by its neighbors. The county has 284,022 residents, compared with 7.4 million in New York City, 1.3 million each in Nassau and Suffolk, and 905,572 in Westchester.
Frustrated Rockland residents say their concerns and issues are routinely ignored by numbers-driven media organizations and government agencies. "Let me put it to you this way," said Paul Adler, a real estate agent who is chairman of the county's Democratic Party. "One of the biggest thrills in Rockland is when the Channel 2 weatherman mentions we're going to have rain. Unlike Westchester or Long Island, the only time we make the news is when there's a murder or a flood."
They are still seething, for instance, over being assigned an 845 area code in June while Westchester was allowed to keep the longstanding 914 prefix. Though Rockland officials protested loudly, the Public Service Commission in Albany decided that more people would have been inconvenienced by changing the area code in Westchester. "Obviously, the common goal was to minimize any disruptions," said David Flanagan, a spokesman for the commission. "Westchester had a greater number of businesses and cellular phone users that would have been disrupted."
Rockland loyalists saw this as yet another affront. "I'm pretty upset," said Ron Javer, a media account executive from Ramapo, who likened it to being stuck away in a corner all over again. "Where is 845?" he asked. "Montana?"
Such complaints are nothing new, of course, in a sprawling state where 62 counties compete for the same resources. And for all its grumbling, Rockland actually fares better than many other counties because it is viewed as a swing district in state elections. Albany's political leaders actively court its voters -- 70,912 enrolled Democrats and 40,900 enrolled Republicans -- because they are known to stray across party lines.
State Senator Thomas P. Morahan, a Rockland Republican who is running for re-election this fall, said Gov. George E. Pataki and other Republican leaders had been very helpful in supporting county projects. He pointed to $840,000 in state funds this year to refurbish downtown areas in the villages of Suffern, Spring Valley and Haverstraw. "While we don't get as much as Westchester, we're not totally abandoned here," he said. "We are not the poor cousin."
State and county officials say it is nearly impossible to pinpoint Rockland's total portion of the state budget because it receives money under various programs and grants. But federal money is tracked more easily, and many county leaders contend that they have been shortchanged in that. Ryan S. Karben, a Democratic county legislator from Ramapo, said his research found that Rockland received only 1 percent of the federal dollars spent annually in New York even though it had 1.5 percent of the state's population.
"There is a need for a much more aggressive style of leadership," he said. "I think a new generation of leaders are going to demand that Rockland get better. I'm not content with crumbs."
One long-running skirmish has been over what county leaders see as a chronic shortage of bus and train service. After years of complaints, Rockland legislators passed a resolution in May that sought state approval to drop out of the M.T.A., which coordinates public transportation for New York City and seven downstate counties. C. Scott Vanderhoef, the county executive, said that Rockland contributed $33.6 million in taxes to the authority in 1998 but received only $11.7 million worth of service and capital improvements.
"They pay attention to enormous numbers," said Mr. Vanderhoef. "For them, this is a small issue; for us, it's big. If you're doing bottom-line stuff, Rockland has to fight harder and yell louder."
Christopher Boylan, the M.T.A.'s deputy executive director, said Rockland's size had not been a factor in decisions. The M.T.A. has continued to improve its services, he said, including pledging $41 million over the next five years to expand and refurbish train service west of the Hudson in Rockland and Orange. In addition, the M.T.A. has contributed $53 million to New Jersey Transit for a train station in Secaucus that will be used as a transfer point by Rockland residents commuting to New York City. "There are periods when member counties may get more than they put in, and some periods when they may put in more," he said. "When they put in money, it's for the benefit of the mobility of the entire region."
Rockland's citizens have not always defended their local interests so vigorously, and they say their county has suffered for that. First, the Tappan Zee Bridge ushered in traffic and pollution. Then, industries created environmental problems.
The federal Environmental Protection Agency has designated 4 Superfund sites in Rockland (compared with 2 in Westchester and 15 in Nassau) over the last two decades. While one of the Rockland sites has been fully cleaned, the others remain hazardous. At the newest site in Hillburn, Hudson Technologies spilled 7,500 pounds of freon last year that made its way into the drinking-water supply. Four wells had to be closed.
"I feel like I'm at ground zero again," said Geoff Welch, a musician who moved to Ramapo in 1981 to escape the pollution and crowds of Manhattan only to spend his free time researching Rockland's environmental issues. "That's why I'm standing my ground and fighting. I could move further out, but the same thing would happen all over again."
Mr. Welch and many others have banded together to preserve their way of life from the dual threats of development and the ambitions of fellow Rockland citizens. In the villages of South Nyack and Nyack, many residents are fighting a proposed expansion of the Tappan Zee Bridge in their backyard. But elsewhere in the county, others say it would help alleviate congestion. A state task force appointed by Governor Pataki has advocated replacing the aging structure with a wider, $4 billion bridge and rail system to accommodate the growing traffic.
In Ramapo, a dozen community groups are trying to block construction of two power plants that they say would drain their water supply and ruin their view of Torne Mountain, a spot immortalized by the Hudson River School painters. Yet, at the same time, two other power plants proposed for the town of Haverstraw have received a much different welcome. Many residents there say the plants will generate more jobs and income from taxes.
Such contradictory impulses have divided Rockland's citizens and perplexed outsiders who do not know what to make of the mixed signals. Does the county want growth and more transportation links to New York City? Or does it really want to hold on to the last vestiges of a rural life that once thrived here? There seems to be no consensus.
On a recent afternoon, Mr. Welch and his neighbors in Ramapo showed off a billboard warning: "Stop the power plants. Once it's up, it's over." But several of the neighbors hastened to add that they were not trying to stop economic growth, just the problems that come along with it.
"People zip by on the highway and they don't realize the history and the wildlife in this county," said Mr. Welch as he pointed with pride to the craggy peak of Torne Mountain rising above low-lying buildings. "We have a lot of work to do to bring it to their attention and give it the respect it deserves."

HEADLINE: THE DEMOCRATS: THE FORMER PRESIDENT;
At Clinton's Twilight, Memories of Reagan's Farewell

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Aug. 13

 BODY:
When you watch President Clinton at the Democratic convention, it may look as if he is stealing President Ronald Reagan's script from 1988. As Mr. Reagan did then, Mr. Clinton plans to bless his No. 2 officially on Monday evening. As Mr. Reagan did then, Mr. Clinton is expected to implore Americans to build on the triumphs of the current administration.
As was the case 12 years ago, members of the party faithful are a bit edgy about their ticket and grouse that their new standard-bearer is not nearly as dynamic as the man he wants to replace. While Mr. Reagan savored a 54 percent job approval rating in the New York Times/CBS News Poll on the eve of his party's convention in 1988 -- impressive for a lame duck -- Mr. Clinton's stands even higher, at 61 percent. 
 Yet for all the apparent similarities, the two presidents' approaches toward their valedictory appearances could not have been more different. While Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton have been roundly accused of hogging the spotlight from his vice president, Mr. Reagan drew plaudits for how he choreographed the passing of power in his party.
While Mr. Clinton popped up in Los Angeles on Friday for fund-raisers and appearances that drowned out the attention -- and complicated fund-raising -- for Al Gore, Mr. Reagan did not arrive in New Orleans until the Sunday before the convention 12 years ago.
Mr. Reagan pulled off what was widely described as a sentimental, nostalgic and certainly graceful journey. He was greeted at a rally in New Orleans to shouts of "Four more years! Four more years!" Delegates wiped tears from their eyes as the president at the convention hailed the party for lighting "a prairie fire" that he said transformed the nation. He promised never to bid a final goodbye.
By contrast, the gossip among delegates, lobbyists and hangers-on here was whether Mr. Clinton would ever -- or even should -- say goodbye.
Even as they acknowledged that Mr. Clinton is dominating the ramp up to the convention, many delegates sounded wistful about his leaving the White House. Some said they did not view Mr. Gore as alluring a leader.
"We all know that if there were not term limits, Bill Clinton would be running for president again," said Martha Aasen, a delegate from Westport, Conn. "Gore doesn't turn me on. He's different. He's sincere. He knows the issues, but he's different." She was glad, she said, that Mr. Gore was not speaking until three days after Mr. Clinton, so there will not be back-to-back comparisons.
Roger Short, a delegate from Detroit, took issue with those who are eager for Mr. Clinton to leave. "He's still the president and has every right to be here," he said. "He raises a lot of money that other Democrats are certainly willing to take. Let's not beat the guy up for his mistakes in the White House."
The difference, of course, between the Clinton and Reagan models is that while Vice President George Bush tried to distance himself from Mr. Reagan on the Iran-contra case, he did not have to worry about being connected to anything approaching the embarrassment of Mr. Clinton's personal scandals. So Mr. Gore is faced with the far more confounding task of trying to take credit for the booming economy encouraged by the current administration but not wanting to be linked to the baggage.
Joe Andrew, the Democratic national chairman, said the party studied Mr. Reagan's approach in 1988 but decided that Mr. Clinton had a different place in his party.
"Most people would see the transfer in 1988 as being successful; it was gracefully done," Mr. Andrew said. "But there was a very different goal. They wanted George Bush to be Ronald Reagan."
Asked then if the Democratic Party did not want Al Gore to be Bill Clinton, he demurred, saying, "We want Al Gore to simply be Al Gore."
It is especially striking that Mr. Clinton has been ridiculed for pulling attention from Mr. Gore given that he has been much more aggressive in helping his vice president than was Mr. Reagan. In fact, Mr. Reagan's endorsement of Mr. Bush was so feeble -- almost like an afterthought -- that he had to clarify his comments the next day.
Robert M. Teeter, who was a top strategist for Mr. Bush, said Mr. Clinton's transgressions are a horrible burden for the vice president. "We had the challenge of Bush having to establish himself in his own right," he said. "In Gore's case, it's a very difficult strategy because the economy's in pretty good shape but people want a change. There's real tension."
David Leland, the chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party, said he understands the political need for Mr. Clinton to depart on Tuesday to leave the stage for Mr. Gore. That doesn't mean he is happy about it.
"I'm in the same hotel as Bill Clinton and I'd love to have him stay around," Mr. Leland said. "We can go out and shoot pool, go have steaks. Whatever."

HEADLINE: How an Illinois County Cleared the Welfare Rolls

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: RUSHVILLE, Ill., Aug. 11

 BODY:
Holly E. Cain, manager of the local welfare office, used to post job openings for welfare recipients just inside the front door of her agency here. She nearly put herself out of business. Welfare disappeared from this county. For more than a year, there have been no new cases, no old cases, no one on the rolls receiving cash assistance.
Mrs. Cain still clips and posts help-wanted advertisements from local merchants, schools and hospitals. But the notices are no longer intended for welfare recipients. All sorts of people stop by to check what jobs might be available. 
 "That's new," said Mrs. Cain, who has run the four-person Schuyler County office of the Illinois Department of Human Services for 20 years. "It's a very positive change."
Schuyler, on the prairie west of Springfield, Ill., was the first county in the state and one of the first in the nation to be "welfare-free." As other counties have approached that status, they have found that the last cases are among the most difficult.
This county, with a population of about 7,500, illustrates in microcosm some of the profound changes that have transformed much of the nation's welfare system since President Clinton signed a landmark welfare law on Aug. 22, 1996.
The elimination of cash assistance here resulted not just from a strong economy, but also from hard work by local welfare officials, who gave lots of personal attention to each case -- and who have many lessons to teach the rest of the country. With practice, they became adept at matching welfare recipients with jobs.
Virtually all the former welfare recipients in Schuyler County have kept their jobs or moved on to higher-paying jobs, Mrs. Cain said.
But poverty has not disappeared here, and life is not easy for the former welfare recipients, some of whom take home less than $1,000 a month from their jobs. But they say they have more self-confidence and self-esteem because they are earning paychecks and not getting cash assistance any more.
"It was scary," said Karen J. DeMoss, 46, describing her transition to work after 12 years on welfare. "But I have more confidence now. And I wish I had gotten off public aid a long time ago."
Ms. DeMoss once held factory jobs, but in her years on welfare she got into a rut. Tears welled up as she recalled how she had to explain to her two teenage sons that the family was poor. That was three years ago. Now, she said, the boys are proud of her because she caters banquets and wedding receptions. "They think it's nice their mom can cook for 300 people," Ms. DeMoss said.
Likewise, Deanna D. Zeisler, 34, who now works in a restaurant and does cleaning, said: "I didn't feel good when I was on public aid. I feel good about myself now. I'm working. It feels good to have a paycheck in my name. It may be a tiny paycheck, but I earned it. It wasn't just handed to me."
Life is still austere for Ms. Zeisler. "I can't afford to go to the movies," she said. She volunteers at the local theater, taking tickets and selling popcorn, in return for the privilege of seeing a film with her three sons.
The goals of the 1996 law and the intent of Congress are understood by Mrs. Cain and her colleagues at the welfare office here. Drawing on their experience and their contacts in the community, they devised a strategy to carry out the law by matching workers with jobs.
"We didn't wave a magic wand," Mrs. Cain said of her effort to whittle down the welfare rolls. Her supervisor at the regional office in Springfield, Gregory Matarelli, said "it's not happenstance" that Schuyler County was the first to eliminate welfare, though that was never an explicit goal.
The welfare office here went about its work methodically and systematically. Whenever a welfare recipient got a job, Mrs. Cain or her caseworkers would call the person every two or three weeks for five months, to make sure the person kept the job.
"We pretty well know most of our clients, or their family members," Mrs. Cain said. (In 1995, the last year for which Census Bureau estimates are available, Schuyler County had a median household income of $27,370, about 80 percent of the comparable figure for the nation as a whole.)
Of the 102 counties in Illinois, four others -- Cumberland, Hardin, Putnam and Washington -- had no welfare cases in July. A total of 53 had fewer than 20 cases each.
State officials pay close attention to those counties. They receive a monthly report describing the circumstances of each family on welfare in any county with fewer than 50 cases. Supervisors like Mr. Matarelli want to know if the families are working, and if not, why not. They discuss each case with local officials, suggesting techniques that have proved effective in other counties.
As the number of cases dwindled, Mrs. Cain formed a "5 o'clock club" for those who remained on welfare -- the cash assistance program officially known as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. They met on Monday evenings to share their job-hunting experiences.
"They gave support to one another," Mrs. Cain said. "They listened to one another much more readily than they'd listen to me standing up there saying the same thing."
Ms. DeMoss said caseworkers prodded her to start looking for work. "They made it sound like a positive thing, not like it was doomsday and we'd be out on the street with nothing," she said.
The number of families on welfare in Illinois has fallen below 100,000 this year for the first time in three decades. State officials say 86,600 families are receiving cash assistance, down from a peak of 247,800 in 1994. More than two-thirds of the cases are in Cook County, which includes Chicago, but even in that county the number of families receiving cash assistance has declined by 50 percent in the last three years.
Illinois differed from many other states in one crucial respect. It encouraged people to hold on to Medicaid and food stamps after they took jobs and lost cash assistance.
The number of people in Schuyler County receiving Medicaid or food stamps rose to 418 in July of this year from 368 in July 1997, even as the number of people on cash assistance dropped to zero.
In many states, people were inadvertently dropped from Medicaid when they lost cash assistance. But in Illinois, state and local officials saw Medicaid as an indispensable form of assistance that could help tens of thousands of welfare recipients take low-wage jobs offering no health insurance benefits. Indeed, Mr. Matarelli and Mrs. Cain said they had audited the records of closed welfare cases to make sure families were receiving the medical and food assistance to which they were entitled.
Linda Renee Baker, secretary of the Illinois Department of Human Services, said, "We are aggressive about letting families know they may still be eligible for food stamps and Medicaid." In addition, she said, the state increased spending on child care by 30 percent this year, to $648 million.
The staff at the Schuyler County welfare office has not been reduced, despite the absence of welfare recipients since April 1999. Mrs. Cain said the four employees still had plenty of work to do, arranging Medicaid, food stamps, child care, transportation and other services for needy county residents, including former welfare recipients. Mr. Matarelli said those services helped welfare recipients "get some traction in the economic mainstream."
Cumberland County, in east central Illinois, had 143 welfare cases in September 1994 and has not had any in 8 of the last 12 months. Asked why the numbers were so low, Paul D. Marti Jr., manager of the local welfare office, said, "It's a combination of good case work, a good economy and good follow-up."
If trends continue, Mr. Marti said, many more counties may become welfare-free. "That would mean that everyone has gotten work or has been assisted in some way to get beyond welfare," he said. But, he added, "State officials discourage talk of that goal," for fear that caseworkers might improperly limit access to welfare if they focused too much on caseload statistics rather than on serving clients.
Mrs. Cain and Mr. Marti said the last cases were the most difficult because these welfare recipients often had mental or physical disabilities, alcohol or drug abuse problems, little work experience, few job skills and limited education.
"But," Mr. Marti said, "because the numbers are so low, you have a lot more time to work with clients, and you can focus on them quite a bit. They're the toughest cases, but they're also the most gratifying when you're able to help them."

HEADLINE: The Indispensable State

 BODY:
Seemingly overnight, California has become for Democrats what the South once was in national elections -- their indispensable electoral building block. So it is fitting for them to celebrate in Los Angeles what they hope will prove a seamless transition from the Age of Clinton to the Age of Gore.
In no other state has the triumph of Clintonism been greater. The magnitude of this triumph was evident at the Republican convention in Philadelphia. Not a single power broker hailed from the nation's largest state -- a state without which no Republican presidential candidate won the presidency in the 20th century. Among the throngs of Congressional leaders and governors assembled in Philadelphia, the only statewide Republican officeholder from California was Secretary of State Bill Jones. And he had endorsed John McCain. 
 Things have gotten that bad for Republicans in the state of Earl Warren, Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan -- a state that was represented on more than half the G.O.P.'s postwar presidential tickets. Lest his party's delegates forget they are reveling in what was once called Reagan Country, President Clinton may want to remind his hosts this evening that in 1992 he was the first Democratic presidential candidate since Lyndon Johnson to carry the state.
The contested center of Californian politics has long been fiscally conservative and socially liberal, and President Clinton helped break the Republican dominance in the state by catering to these affinities. Positioning his as the party of balanced budgets and free trade left Republicans to wallow in the morass of immigration, abortion and guns.
Democrats may want to pay homage to the special role of Pete Wilson, the former Republican governor, in the state party's reversal of fortunes. His anti-immigrant crusade, a political blunder of epic proportions, may keep the state in the Democratic column long after the adopted son from Arkansas (this is the president's 55th trip to California while in office) leaves the scene.
Governor Wilson fashioned his anti-immigrant pitch in the throes of a devastating recession early in the 1990's, one made more severe than elsewhere in the nation by the post-cold-war downsizing of the state's defense industry. At the time, appealing to disgruntled middle-class whites seemed like a winning strategy. Indeed, Governor Wilson was re-elected in 1994 while backing Proposition 187, an initiative to deprive illegal immigrants of access to education and other social services.
But the long-term damage to the party proved devastating. Along with other Republican-backed measures aimed at overturning bilingual education and affirmative action, Proposition 187 drove a whole generation of Hispanics into the Democratic fold. Mr. Wilson garnered 44 percent of the Hispanic vote when he first ran for governor in 1990. By 1998, however, the Republican gubernatorial candidate, Dan Lungren, received less than 20 percent.
Worse, the G.O.P.'s is a shrinking slice of a rapidly growing pie. Hispanics make up about a third of the state's population and are expected to become the majority in the next half-century.
Meanwhile, many of the less-educated, disgruntled Anglos who may have applauded the state Republican Party's drift to the right have left the state. The recession triggered a massive migration, well over a million of them, in the first half of the decade. To those who remained in California to experience the current tide of prosperity, the party leadership's view of immigration as more of a threat than an opportunity seemed bizarrely defeatist. Where once Ronald Reagan rhapsodized about America being a shining city on a hill, Pete Wilson now wanted to build a moat around it.
But a word of caution is in order for California Democrats as they uncork the Champagne bottles this week. Independents, not Democrats, are the only growing category of registered voters. Recent polls suggest the race could be closer in California than previously thought, and Vice President Al Gore's choice of Senator Joseph Lieberman as his running mate could dampen the enthusiasm of the party's Hollywood backers.
Democrats would also be foolish to take the votes of Hispanics, those Americans most likely to still live in a traditional family, for granted. This is particularly true if Gov. George W. Bush succeeds in his effort to broaden his party's voting base. In his book "Cadillac Desert," Marc Reisner called California a "beautiful fraud," referring to how much of the desert state was transformed into a verdant mirage. It may yet prove that to political analysts too eager to read permanence into the current political snapshot. Things change, especially in Reagan Country.

HEADLINE: THE DEMOCRATS: LOS ANGELES DIARY;
Lieberman Injects Bit of Yiddish, Clintons Stay Late and Connecticut Is Noticed

BYLINE: By BERNARD WEINRAUB and ELISABETH BUMILLER 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Aug. 13

 BODY:
Maybe Jackie Mason should worry. After all, the Democratic vice-presidential candidate seems to enjoy using Yiddish words like "chutzpah" and Jewish-style phrases that have not often been heard on the national campaign trail.
Just this morning, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman was asked by Tim Russert on NBC's "Meet the Press," what would happen if the Gore-Lieberman ticket won the presidency. The inauguration date is Jan. 20, 2001, a Saturday. As an Orthodox Jew, Mr. Lieberman strictly observes the Sabbath, from sundown on Fridays to sundown on Saturdays, which ostensibly prohibits working, riding in vehicles and other activities. 
 Mr. Lieberman smiled. "Well, as my mother would say, Tim, if she were here, 'Sweetheart, we should have such a problem.' "
He went on to say that he would probably stay near the Capitol on Friday night, to avoid having to travel by car. And, if the Secret Service agreed, he would walk from the Capitol to the White House to participate in the events.
Mr. Lieberman said that he has driven on the Sabbath in the past if important issues were at stake.
The senator has talked about his religious roots and convictions repeatedly -- an issue intertwined with his negative views about Hollywood morality and what he has termed the avalanche of films, television and music that are excessively violent or sexual.
Today, the senator said he would not back down on those views, even though many Hollywood executives and performers are Democrats and are contributing heavily to the campaign.
Privately, several prominent Democrats in the entertainment industry have said that contributors like Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen, two of the owners of the film company DreamWorks, have been called by Vice President Al Gore, who is sensitive to Hollywood's uneasiness with Mr. Lieberman, and asked their opinion of his running mate and that they not publicly criticize the choice.
Mr. Gore got what he wanted. Criticisms have been muted. The moguls got what they wanted. A call from the presidential candidate asking for a favor.
Mr. Lieberman's Jewish roots, of course, are the talk of Hollywood. At a fund-raiser on Saturday night, the comedian Red Buttons came onstage to the music of "Hava Nagilla." Mr. Buttons grinned, calling the song, "The Democratic Party's new campaign song."
 
And the Clintons Hung On
It was not a Bill Clinton record for partying late, but it came close.
The president who loves Hollywood did not leave a Brentwood fund-raiser top heavy with the B list -- Cher, Paul Anka, Milton Berle, Diana Ross, Michael Bolton -- until 1:45 this morning, and did not get back to his hotel until 2:10 a.m.
Maybe that was because the president's wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is running for the Senate in New York, was having a good time sitting at dinner next to Brad Pitt, who came with his new wife, Jennifer Aniston.
Or maybe it was because Mr. Clinton was intent on clinging to every moment of his waning presidency.
"I was thinking how quickly it all passed and what an absolute joy it was," the president told the 1,400 people who raised, depending on the estimate, from $1 million to $4 million for his wife's Senate campaign and the Democratic Party.
The president added: "I used to tell people in some of the dark days, when they'd say, don't you sometimes regret that you ever got into this -- I'd say, Lord, no. Just a few twists in the road and I could be home doing real estate transactions in a musty loft."
Hollywood, which also billed the event as a "gala salute to William Jefferson Clinton," fell over itself with sometimes bizarre accolades.
From Stan Lee, the Marvel Comic books publishing tycoon, the creator of Spider-Man and a host of the party: "I'm a guy who's dealt with super heroes most of my life, and sir, you have great potential. I think you would learn to climb the side of buildings and wear spandex tights. I think I could make you famous."
From John Travolta, who, in the movie "Primary Colors," played a Clinton-like president: "If I were hungry, you'd sit right down and eat a cheeseburger with me, not even suggesting holding the fries. But now, if I were president, what would I miss? Well I would miss flying around in that classic 707. Now, I happen to own one of those puppies. And if you and the missis ever need a ride."
It was not until the very end of the party -- held under the lemon and grapefruit trees on the estate of Ken Roberts, a radio and real estate magnate -- that anyone even got around to mentioning the name of the Democratic presidential nominee. And that had to come from the president himself. "He understands the future," Mr. Clinton said of Vice President Al Gore. "He was talking about global warming when we ran in '92, and people were still making fun of him."
Mr. Clinton got teary-eyed several times during the evening, but tried to reassure the audience: "I'm not going anywhere except to a different line of work. I'll try to be a useful citizen and I'll try to hang around."
 
A Republican in the Crowd
Democratic revelers at the Century Plaza Hotel, the convention home for the New York delegation, were somewhat startled to see Bruce J. Teitelbaum turn up.
Mr. Teitelbaum, a Republican, was the aggressive Senate campaign manager for Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani until the mayor withdrew from the race in May and left him unemployed.
So just what was he doing at the hotel? Gathering intelligence, perhaps?
"I'm going to relax a little bit," said Mr. Teitelbaum, whose wife, Suri Kasirer, a Democrat, is a Gore fund-raiser and a delegate from New York. Ms. Kasirer was staying at the Century Plaza, Mr. Teitelbaum said, while he was staying at the Peninsula.
"She has her hotel, I have mine," he said. "We visit each other."
 
For Connecticut, Star Power
The Connecticut delegation suddenly finds itself with new cachet and the selection of Senator Joseph I. Lieberman has suddenly infused the small state's Democratic delegates with star power.
Connecticut Democrats allowed that their state does not exactly have a reputation for Bacchanalian revelry. Nobody comes to Trumbull for Mardi Gras, as one delegate dryly noted. And until a week ago, the only official event the delegation had scheduled in Los Angeles was a reception last night sponsored by the natural gas industry.
Now, however, all people and things connected to Connecticut are in demand, and the gas party was something of a hot ticket, though Mr. Lieberman was not arriving in town until Monday night.
"People have been calling me wondering how to get into it," said William Curry, a onetime gubernatorial candidate and former White House official, who sat next to Mr. Lieberman in the State Senate years ago. "I would flatly say, the number of inquiries I would normally receive for something like this would be close to zero."
"If such things could run to negative numbers, chances are I'd be getting calls from delegates saying, 'How can I get out of this?' "

HEADLINE: THE DEMOCRATS: THE PLATFORM;
Democrats Ready the Stage For Their Post-Clinton Era

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Aug. 13

 BODY:
The Democratic National Convention will adopt a platform on Tuesday that, like its Republican counterpart, makes a broad effort to reach voters in the middle, calling for schools to be more accountable for student performance, stricter control of the nation's borders, expanded global trade, a stronger military and the death penalty.
But in the details, the platforms sharply diverge on most issues, providing clear indications of how Gore and Bush administrations would differ. 
 *The Democrats offer modest, focused tax cuts to help middle-class families, while the Republicans call for an across-the-board income tax cut to stimulate the economy.
*The Democrats call for increased financing for public schools, while the Republicans support taxpayer-financed vouchers to help parents pay for private schools.
*The Democrats would keep the Social Security system as it is, bolstering it with general tax revenues. The Republicans call for allowing taxpayers to invest part of their payroll taxes in the financial markets.
*The Democrats propose extending Medicaid, the health care program for those with low incomes, to more children, while the Republicans advocate tax breaks to help people buy private health insurance.
*The Democrats call for developing the technology for a limited system to protect the nation from ballistic missile attacks, while the Republicans support moving full speed ahead with an ambitious, space-based system.
*The Democrats endorse civil rights protections for gays and support laws intended to expand the rights of unions to organize workers. The Republicans oppose gay rights and support laws intended to reduce the ability of unions to organize.
For all those clear disagreements, the platforms are alike in that they closely reflect the styles, broad visions and campaign agendas of the two candidates. Writing a platform usually tests a candidate's ability to manage the factions in his party, and both Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore successfully enforced a high degree of unity on their platform committees.
For Mr. Gore, the result has been a Democratic platform that wraps him more tightly than ever in Mr. Clinton's legacy.
Far from stamping a distinctive Gore imprint on the Democratic Party, the document warmly embraces the centrist policies of the Clinton administration and lavishly credits them for the prosperity of the last seven years.
"In 1992, Bill Clinton and Al Gore were elected to turn the American economy around," the platform declares in its opening lines. "Today, the success of these new ideas is clear."
From those lines through most of its 20,000 words, the platform articulates a "new Democrat" agenda that cuts a middle path between welfare-state liberalism and laissez-faire Republicanism, advocating active but smaller government, fiscal discipline, free trade and tough crime policies.
Mr. Clinton first imposed those positions on the party in 1992 over the objections of liberals, and Mr. Gore's aides fought back efforts -- albeit weak ones -- by progressives again this year to pull the 2000 platform leftward on health care, defense spending and trade.
"Both the rhetoric and the positions are where the party set off in '92," said Thomas Mann, a senior fellow with the Brookings Institution, a nonpartisan policy organization. "Everything is designed to say, 'We are continuing with the policies and the progress of the Clinton years, even though we are separating ourselves from the man.' "
If the Democratic platform represents continuity, the platform adopted by the Republicans in Philadelphia makes more of a break, in tone if not always in substance, with their platforms of the recent past.
Much like Mr. Clinton in 1992, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas has tried to use the 2000 platform to capture a broader swath of moderate swing voters. While the Republican platform remains fundamentally conservative -- strongly opposing abortion, gay rights and gun control while calling for tax cuts, smaller government and more military spending -- some of the hard-edged proposals from 1996 are gone. The platform no longer would deny citizenship to the American-born children of illegal immigrants, abolish the federal department of education and end federal financing for the arts.
Instead it calls for more inclusive attitudes toward immigrants, a strong federal role in making schools more effective and the preservation of the biggest of big-government programs, Social Security.
But for both candidates, tamping down open dissent from their parties' most militant wings meant accepting language that sometimes went beyond their original positions, or flatly contradicted their views.
For Mr. Gore, the major fight was on trade. Over the objections of labor unions, the platform endorses the policy of "fast track," which would allow presidents to negotiate certain treaties without Congressional approval. But at the behest of unions, the platform also calls for negotiating labor and environmental standards into all trade accords.
For Mr. Bush, adopting softer positions on issues like education and immigration meant accepting language flatly opposing abortion, even though he would personally allow it in cases of rape or incest or when a woman's life is in danger.
In tone, both platforms also reflect the stump styles of the two candidates. The Republican platform is heavily salted with the kind of optimistic, inclusive-sounding phrases that flavor Mr. Bush's speeches.
"We approach these challenges with compassionate conservatism, a concept that is as old as the pioneers heading west in wagon trains, in which everyone had responsibility to follow the rules, but no one would be left behind," the platform says.
The Democratic document mirrors Mr. Gore's knife-edged efforts to cast Mr. Bush as a risk to the nation's peace and prosperity. Thus, the platform asserts, the Republicans "eschew fiscal discipline and offer up nothing less than fiscal disaster." Mr. Bush's Social Security plan would "take the 'security' out of Social Security." And the Republican proposal for a space-based missile defense system "would plunge us into a new arms race."
Yet even as it attacks the Republicans, the Democratic platform manages to echo its rivals' words. "If America is to secure prosperity, peace and security for all, we cannot afford to go back," it says. "We must move forward together and we must not leave anyone behind."

GRAPHIC: Chart: "Comparing the Platforms"
Some of the areas of difference between the platform adopted by the Republicans in Philadelphia and that expected to be passed by the Democrats in Los Angeles this week.
 
DEMOCRATS
 
ABORTION
"The Democratic Party stands behind the right of every woman to choose, consistent with Roe v. Wade, and regardless of ability to pay. We believe it is a fundamental constitutional liberty that individual Americans -- not government -- can best take responsibility for making the most difficult and intensely personal decisions regarding reproduction."
 
CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM
Says the McCain-Feingold campaign-finance bill would be "the very first piece of legislation that a President Al Gore will submit to Congress." Also proposes "tough new lobbying reform, publicly guaranteed TV time for debates and advocacy by candidates, and a crackdown on special interest issue ads" and "a public-private, nonpartisan Democracy Endowment which will raise money from Americans and finance Congressional elections -- with no other contri-butions allowed to candidates who accept the funding."
 
FOREIGN POLICY AND MILITARY DEPLOYMENT
"We cannot be the world's policeman, and we must be discriminating in our approach. But where the stakes are high, when we can assure ourselves that nothing short of military engagement can secure our national interest, when we know that we have the military forces available for the task, when we have made our best efforts to join with allies, and when the cost is proportionate to the objective, we must be ready to act."
 
MISSILE DEFENSE
"Al Gore and the Democratic Party support the development of the technology for a limited national missile defense system that will be able to defend the U.S. against a missile attack from a state that has acquired weapons of mass destruction The Democratic Party places a high value on ensuring that any such system is compatible with the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty."
 
SCHOOL CHOICE
"What America needs are public schools that compete with one another and are held accountable for results, not private school vouchers that drain resources from public schools and hand over the public's hard-earned tax dollars to private schools with no accountability."
 
GUN CONTROL
"We need mandatory child safety locks, to protect our children. We should require a photo license ID, a full background check, and a gun safety test to buy a new handgun in America."
 
STATUS OF GAYS
"We support continued efforts to end workplace discrimination against gay men and lesbians. We support the full inclusion of gay and lesbian families in the life of the nation. This would include an equitable alignment of benefits."
 
REPUBLICANS
 
ABORTION
"We support a human life amendment to the Constitution and we endorse legislation to make clear that the 14th Amendment's protections apply to unborn children. Our purpose is to have legislative and judicial protection of that right against those who perform abortions. We oppose using public revenues for abortion and will not fund organizations which advocate it."
 
CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM
"Enact 'Paycheck Protection,' ensuring that no union member is forced to contribute to anybody's campaign -- and stopping an annual rip-off of $300 million from union families by Washington-based politicos.
"Preserve the right of every individual and all groups -- whether for us or against us -- to express their opinions and advocate their issues. We will not allow any arm of government to restrict this constitutionally guaranteed right."
 
FOREIGN POLICY AND MILITARY DEPLOYMENT
"The military is not a civilian police force or a political referee
"A Republican president will identify and pursue vital American national interests. He will set priorities and he will stick to them. Under his leadership, the United States will build and secure the peace. Republicans know what it takes to accomplish this: robust military forces, strong alliances, expanding trade, and resolute diplomacy."
 
MISSILE DEFENSE
'America must deploy effective missile defenses at the earliest possible date. These defenses must be designed to protect all 50 states, America's deployed forces overseas, and our friends and allies. We will seek a negotiated change in the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty that will allow the United States to use all technologies and experiments required to deploy robust missile defenses."
 
SCHOOL CHOICE
"We endorse the principles of Governor Bush's education reforms, which will expand parental choice and encourage competition by providing parents with information on their child's school, increasing the number of charter schools, and expanding education savings accounts for use from kindergarten through college."
 
GUN CONTROL
"Although we support background checks we oppose federal licensing of law-abiding gun owners and national gun registration as a violation of the Second Amendment and an invasion of privacy of honest citizens."
 
STATUS OF GAYS
"We support the traditional definition of 'marriage' as the legal union of one man and one woman, and we believe that federal judges and bureaucrats should not force states to recognize other living arrangements as marriages."(pg. A18)

HEADLINE: In America;
Gore's Crucial Week

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
If the Republican convention was an infomercial, the Democratic convention is a minefield.
With friends like Bill and Hillary hijacking the spotlight (and trailing the noxious memories of Monica behind them), and with anarchists and other protesters threatening to turn parts of the city upside down, Al Gore and Joe Lieberman will be lucky to escape L.A. with any momentum at all. 
 For a while last week, Mr. Gore looked like a genuine leader. The bold choice of Joe Lieberman as his running mate was deftly handled and widely hailed. But then the Clintons took over. On Thursday we were treated to the spectacle of the president appearing before thousands of evangelical ministers in a Chicago suburb, where he very publicly revisited -- in the name of contrition -- the incredible stain he put on the nation's highest office.
By week's end the first couple had arrived in Los Angeles, where they immediately began hobnobbing with the stars and fund-raising for themselves. It was another blatant display of the Clintons' well-known selfishness, and there was little the vice president could do but try and put the best face on it.
Mr. Gore had other problems, one of them being the fallout from the plan by Representative Loretta Sanchez, a California Democrat, to hold a fund-raiser at Hugh Hefner's Playboy Mansion. Ms. Sanchez was one of the few people in the entire country who failed to recognize that anything even remotely connected with playboys and naked ladies is a no-no for the duration of this campaign. Under tremendous pressure, she finally backed off.
While these internal conflicts were being played out, the forces intent on disrupting the convention -- protesters, demonstrators, anarchists and assorted zanies -- were steadily mobilizing. One police official said that on a scale of 1 to 10, the likelihood that violence would erupt was 10.
Some demonstrators said they hoped to thwart legal proceedings by refusing to wear clothes if they were arrested. The Los Angeles Times quoted a judge as saying, "We'll have naked court, if necessary."
None of this does Al Gore need. What he needs is a dignified convention, where he and Senator Lieberman can attempt to make the case that their leadership and their policies -- not Bill Clinton's and not the Republicans' -- are the best course for the U.S. to follow.
Gore-Lieberman is not a charismatic ticket. They either win on substance or not at all. But it's awfully hard to get your message heard amid the din of Clinton narcissism, dumb distractions and demonstrations in the street.
Forty years ago John Kennedy was nominated by the Democrats in Los Angeles. In his acceptance speech he said that America stood "on the edge of a New Frontier."
"Beyond that frontier," he said, "are the uncharted areas of science and space, unsolved problems of peace and war, unconquered pockets of ignorance and prejudice, unanswered questions of poverty and surplus."
In these very early days of the 21st century, the United States enjoys unrivaled power and prosperity. But the challenges facing the nation fall into categories remarkably similar to those identified by Kennedy.
This is the week for Al Gore to make his case, to argue convincingly that government is not the enemy of the people, and not a servant of the rich, but rather, as Abraham Lincoln said, a collective effort "to do for a community of people whatever they need to have done, but cannot do at all in their separate and individual capacities."
Conventions are traditionally exercises in zaniness and egomania. But they are also serious forums for the expression of important ideas.
Nearly one in five American children are poor, and many working families, despite the extraordinary economy, are having trouble paying bills and putting food on the table. What do Gore and Lieberman have to say about trying to bring them into the mainstream? What do they have to say about the nation's school system, and health care, and global warming, and gun control and abortion and the Supreme Court?
This is the week to find out. Bill Clinton is not running this year, and he could help his party and his country by adopting a lower profile. This election should not be about a stain on a blue dress. It's time to move on.

HEADLINE: THE ENERGY RUSH -- A special report.;
Promise and Peril in New York Power Plans

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
Just off 20th Avenue in Astoria, Queens, behind a steel and brick fence guarded by dogs, sits an old hulk of a power plant that was built when cars had fins and Uncle Miltie was the king of prime time. The plant, designed to burn coal, then oil, had become a symbol of power generation at its dirtiest and least efficient by the time it was closed in 1993.
Seven years later, the surging demand for electricity is so intense in New York that even a derelict like Astoria Generating No. 2, as it is formally known, may get a second life. A Maryland-based company that bought the plant last year has proposed spending more than $15 million to repair and retool it for backup use on the city's peak energy-demand days in summer. 
 In other words, the plant's half-century-old boiler would contribute its electricity -- and its unfiltered pollution -- only on the days when the city's air quality is already at its smoggy, ozone-laden worst. Meanwhile, the company's investment, at current wholesale energy prices, would be recouped in about a year whether the plant operates or not.
New York City's energy bazaar has opened for business, and the proposed transformation of a Truman administration relic into a 21st-century cash cow is just the beginning. Altogether, at least 13 proposals for power plants across the city have been put forward over the last few months -- a staggering surge of power production that would equal more than five Indian Point 2 nuclear plants. If all were to be built, it would be the largest one-time power expansion in the city's history.
The wave of proposals, coming at a time when blackouts, equipment failures and soaring energy costs have heightened public awareness about the delicate balance of electricity supply and demand, marks the beginning of a period of great promise and peril for New York, city officials, local community leaders and environmental experts say. Air quality, energy reliability and electricity costs are all at stake.
And the political landscape on which the power debate will unfold over the next few years, with huge citywide coalitions of neighborhood groups, powerful out-of-state corporations, and a mayoral race on the horizon, is just as unexplored.
"It's politics, it's power, it's money, it's everything," said Barbara Vetell, who lives in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, across the street from the proposed East River site of one of the first plants moving through the state approval process. That plan was withdrawn this summer after a storm of local protest and what the developer said were economic changes that made the plant less attractive.
The technology for generating electricity has advanced significantly since the mid-1970's, the last time a major plant was built in New York City, energy experts say. All the proposed plants would use either combined cycle generation, which uses far less fuel to produce the same amount of power, or cogeneration, which creates another energy product as part of the process.
But because the electricity market has been deregulated, and current wholesale energy prices are so high, older, dirtier plants like Astoria No. 2 may still prove to be economically viable. Some experts say the city could ultimately end up with a lot more power plants but no improvement in air quality.
The new dynamics of the energy market have resulted in far more proposals for plants than the city really needs, state and city officials say. Which ones get built and which ones do not -- and how free-market capital, environmentalism and local politics will shape that debate -- are questions that are only now being asked.
The proposals have sharply divided environmentalists. Community groups have sprung up from the South Bronx to the Lower East Side of Manhattan and especially in Astoria, where much of the new power generation would be concentrated. And under state procedure, companies proposing power plants are required to help finance the groups that oppose them. That has created a potential cash pool of millions of dollars that could transform grass-roots organizations into powerful lobbying blocs.
Politics and family traditions have merged. Peter F. Vallone, the City Council speaker and likely Democratic candidate for mayor next year, came into politics in the late 1960's, fighting against coal-burning plants in Queens. Now he has taken a lead role on the issue once again, pushing for a new pollution-emissions system that would give the city more control over how its energy is produced. His son, Peter F. Vallone Jr., is the lawyer for the largest group opposing new power plants in the city and has formed an exploratory committee to seek a City Council seat for himself.
Gerald Norlander, executive director of the Public Utility Law Project, an Albany-based group that represents low-income energy and telecommunications consumers, said, "We're in a pretty chaotic moment here."
In the regulated monopoly days, Mr. Norlander said, residents knew that if a power plant was built in their backyard, it would generate electricity for their community based on its needs. Now, he said, when power can be sold like lumber or steel or any other commodity, the perceived social costs of a power plant are higher because no community can be sure where its electricity will go.
"We're in an era where the market sends a signal to build by spiking prices," he said. "The planning process is completely different."
 
The Environment
Orion Power Holdings Inc., the Maryland company that owns Astoria Generating -- a complex of five separate units built between 1951 and the early 1960's -- has characterized the resurrection of No. 2 as a stopgap measure. It would only be used for the next few years, or until newer, cleaner plants begin operation. Then, the company has said in its applications with the state, No. 2 would again be retired.
The company has also said that because of the plant's antiquated air-emissions controls, it would limit operation of No. 2 to times of peak demand, and no more than about 37 days a year. Orion said the plant would burn only natural gas, which is a cleaner-burning fuel than the oil that was used during the plant's past life. Like many companies that operate older plants, Orion would make most of its profit by selling the plant's availability to begin operating -- a promise to deliver energy if needed -- rather than for actually generating electricity full time, which plant officials say would be cost-prohibitive and would exceed pollution standards.
At 170 megawatts, No. 2 would also be one of the smallest plants in New York City. A megawatt, or one million watts, is generally considered enough to supply power to about 250 single-family homes, or a larger number of apartments, at periods of peak demand. By contrast, the largest plant in the city, Ravenswood, just south of Astoria on the East River, can produce 2,168 megawatts.
While Orion appears to have committed itself to closing down No. 2 eventually, according to its application to the State Department of Environmental Conservation, the reality is more complicated. Under its plan, Orion would expand power capacity by 499 megawatts at another of its Astoria units, Generating No. 3. By doing so, the company would be forced to shut down No. 2 because its output would exceed the authorized cap.
But the application to restart No. 2 is much further along in the approval process and could receive a decision from the state as early as this month. The plan to increase power at No. 3 has not even reached the stage of a formal application.
Energy experts say that while Astoria No. 2 is different from the 12 other plant proposals, which call for either new construction or expanding capacity at existing facilities, it also underlines the central nagging issue of the electricity debate: When the new, cleaner plants start up, can anyone really be sure that the older, dirtier ones will really fade away? If the 499-megawatt expansion at Astoria should become derailed or denied, for example, might old No. 2 churn and belch its smoke for another generation?
Industry officials and state regulators, including the chairwoman of the Public Service Commission, Maureen O. Helmer, have said that the raw pressures of the market will force out the older plants, which simply will not be able to compete with new technologies that can produce more energy at lower cost. Other politicians and environmentalists are not as sure.
"These plants are half a century old and still going strong -- are we talking another half century?" Speaker Vallone said. "Many of these companies are bonding their existing property -- does that mean we wait 20 or 30 years until the bonds are paid off?"
Some electricity experts say the power market is too volatile -- and demand in New York too voracious -- to predict what will happen to old plants like No. 2.
"Once they get it up and running, there could be a lot of economic reasons for Orion to at least prolong and maximize the number of hours it can run," said Edward A. Smeloff, the executive director of the Pace Law School Energy Project, a research and advocacy group. "If there's a pending availability crisis," he added, "they'll have strong leverage to keep it in operation even longer."
 
Regulation and Politics
Hardly anyone believes that all the proposed plants will be built. And in many ways, that is the crux of the matter. Exactly how many really are needed? And where will they be built? Where is the line to be drawn between the powers of the free market and the authority of elected officials and regulators?
The central problem, politicians and environmental groups say, is that under deregulation, no formal framework exists to consider all the power plants in a systematic way. The process is more like a pipeline, they say, with projects expected to emerge one by one for consideration, with the first ones more likely to be approved than the last, regardless of merit or location. Of the 13 plans, for example, some have been formally filed with the Public Service Commission, while others are still months from that step, and are still being evaluated by the organization that runs the state's power market, called the Independent System Operator.
"You almost have to say no to all, because you just don't know what's going to happen -- there's no mechanism in place to make a tradeoff," said Ashok Gupta, an economist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, a private conservation group.
Mr. Gupta said his organization plans to support some of the plant proposals and oppose others, with the overall goal of reducing air pollution. But walking that line is a delicate business, he conceded, because it puts the organization in potential conflict with neighborhood groups that only see the plant in their neighborhood. The N.R.D.C. has taken no position yet on Astoria Generating No. 2. Other groups, like Environmental Advocates, a group based in Albany, have declined to get involved.
Part of the problem for policy makers and environmental groups is that almost everything has changed since the last time major power plant construction was an issue in New York, in the early to mid-70's.
Back then, the technology of power generation dictated huge plants of 1,000 megawatts or more, like Ravenswood and Astoria Generating, which can still produce 1,080 megawatts with only three of its five units operating.
Then, there were only a few players -- the city, the state, and the local monopoly, Con Edison. Now there are multiple private corporations and partnerships.
The State Board on Electric Generation Siting and the Environment, which is led by Ms. Helmer, the chairwoman of the Public Service Commission, is the primary authority for deciding where new power plants are built. Municipalities and community groups can contribute information, but the decision-making resides in Albany.
Many people involved in the process describe a feeling of being between worlds -- the market for raw wholesale energy has been deregulated, but the delivery to the individual home is still a regulated monopoly. Competition was expected to drive down energy prices, but instead prices have gone up.
Certainly, New York is not alone in its struggles. In California, which was one of the first states to deregulate electricity in 1996, some politicians are calling for a reconsideration of the issue as prices have soared this summer. Politicians in other states where deregulation is just beginning have asked for a time-out to reconsider. In New York, where deregulation has been introduced in stages beginning in 1997, few officials are calling for a return to the monopoly days, but the momentum to take back some control over the process appears to be growing.
A bill being drafted in the City Council, for example, would give New York the authority to regulate the output of lead into the atmosphere. Lead is a small element of the pollution produced by plants, but the bill would give the city a handle on power generation that it does not now have, sponsors say.
On Tuesday, Gov. George E. Pataki signed a bill requiring Con Ed to give back more than $100 million to its customers, who have been paying higher energy bills this summer because of the shutdown of the Indian Point 2 plant in Buchanan, N.Y., this year.
But risk and opportunity are also intermingled. Under state regulations, groups opposing a power plant can receive up to $1,000 per megawatt for consulting and engineering analysis, paid by the corporation seeking to build a plant.
For the city as a whole, that creates a potential pool of about $3 million in so-called intervenor funds, with half going to local community groups and half to the city. Anthony J. Gigantiello, the president of the largest anti-plant group, Choke, for the Coalition Helping Organize a Kleaner Environment, said that meetings were held last week to try to organize one vast coalition that would confront the power companies on a united front.
 
The Flow
The first premise of every formulation about New York City's power supply is that the city exists in a pocket. Because of the limitations of the feeder system of stations that connect New York to the power grid upstate, most of the city's energy capacity must be produced from within its boundaries. Only so much can go in or out.
But the pocket may soon have a hole in it.
The Long Island Power Authority has received preliminary approval for a power line that would allow 300 megawatts of electricity to move under Long Island Sound between New England and Long Island. And while the idea of the line is that Long Island, which is also part of the local energy pocket and which is also facing a long-term energy shortfall, could buy power from companies in the New England states, power lines can move electricity in both directions.
The possibility of a potential power drain to the east and north has in turn dredged up issues of class conflict in communities like the South Bronx and the Lower East Side, where residents say they fear their neighborhoods being polluted to power the homes of the Hamptons or suburban Massachusetts.
In addition, many residents in neighborhoods like Washington Heights in Upper Manhattan, which suffered a major blackout during a period of peak demand last year, have said they believe their community was deliberately sacrificed when power ran short, despite the denials from Con Ed.
Even some of the people who accept the argument that newer plants will help the city and regional air quality say that the proposed locations of the plants have raised issues of fairness.
"It's partly an environmental justice issue that we're concentrating on here," said Susan Stetzer, vice president of the East River Environmental Coalition, which formed in February to fight a plan by a Con Ed subsidiary to expand energy production at its 13th Street plant in Manhattan. "While the city over all would have less pollution, the Lower East Side, which already has a disproportionate amount of asthma, will bear the burden," Ms. Stetzer said.

Chart: "Power Tech: More Electricity, Less Pollution"
More than a dozen proposals for power plants have been submitted over the last few months in New York City. The technology for generating electricity has advanced significantly since the last time a major plant was built in New York, in the mid-1970's, and the new proposals include two cleaner and more efficient methods.
 
Single Stage Power Plant
A gas turbine turns fuel into electricity by compressing air to spin a shaft. In older plants, leftover heat from this process was released as pollution. But additional power can be created with this heat . . .
 
Combined Cycle Plants
Combined cycle plants take exhaust heat to create steam and turn another turbine. Even the heat and hot water remaining after this process can be used down the line . . .
 
Cogeneration Plants
Adding one more level of reuse, cogeneration plants use the remaining exhaust for industrial uses. For example, the heat and hot water can be used in the treatment of chemicals.

Saturday's thunderstorm dropped 14 inches of rain on Jefferson Township in north-central New Jersey. The damage included 300 homes flooded, several bridges and roads washed out, downed trees, ruined cars and boats and two dams gone. No one was killed, but the damage in Jefferson Township and in surrounding Morris, Sussex, Passaic, Bergen, Warren, Essex and Hunterdon Counties may run into hundreds of millions of dollars. B1
 
Reclusive Gunman Had Arsenal
Arthur Alalouf, the Brooklyn man who wounded four police officers on Saturday before he was killed in a shootout, had lived for years as something of a hermit before he unraveled, the police said. Neighbors said he made them nervous. A search of his home after the police killed him turned up an armory of pistols, rifles and shotguns in his basement and samurai swords in a closet. He also had knives and daggers, the police said, and boxes upon boxes of ammunition. B1
 
Worries Over Energy Demands
The surging demand for electricity is so intense in New York that at least 13 power plant proposals have been made recently for the city. Blackouts, equipment failures and soaring energy costs have raised awareness about the delicate balance of electricity supply and demand. Air quality, energy reliability and electricity costs are all at stake in a debate that is likely to be influenced by politics and money. A1

HEADLINE: THE DEMOCRATS: THE NUMBERS;
Poll Finds Delegates to the Left of Both Public and Party

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER with MARJORIE CONNELLY 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Aug. 13

 BODY:
The Democratic delegates arriving here to nominate Vice President Al Gore for president think of themselves as moderates, but their views on issues from affirmative action to an activist federal government are more liberal than those of the public or even Democratic voters generally, a New York Times/CBS News Poll shows.
On one issue, the death penalty, a random sample of 1,042 of the 4,339 delegates was decisively more liberal than Mr. Gore, though 56 percent said they were moderates. Asked to choose between the death penalty and life in prison without parole, 20 percent of the delegates preferred executions, compared with 46 percent of Democrats generally and 51 percent of the public. Mr. Gore is one of those supporters. 
 Kenneth R. Moore, a 72-year-old delegate from Sun Lakes, Ariz., explained that attitude. He said: "I've gone 180 degrees on the death penalty. I used to favor it. But with the questionable executions recently, particularly with the mentally retarded, I just can't support the death penalty without standards that require absolute proof and an adequate defense. Without that, there is no justice."
The ideological distance between the Democratic delegates and their rank and file was similar to the gap displayed two weeks ago in Philadelphia, where Republican delegates were strikingly more conservative than ordinary Republicans or ordinary Americans. Such gaps have also been found at past conventions.
Most of the interviews of the delegates were conducted in July, before the selection of Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut as Mr. Gore's running mate and Dick Cheney as the vice-presidential choice by Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the Republican nominee for president.
The death penalty is an example of Democratic delegates' being distant from public attitudes. Occasionally, though, they were closer than Republicans were. For example, 63 percent of Democratic delegates and 64 percent of the American public agreed with the statement that "We must protect the environment even if it means jobs in your community are lost because of it." Only 32 percent of Republican delegates agreed.
Donna I. King, a delegate from Norwalk, Conn., explained her view today, saying: "Now is the right time to focus on the environment. The economy is strong, unemployment is low. Address this issue in the best of times, and focus on inspection, regulation and enforcement."
One distinct difference between the Democratic and Republican delegates was their confidence about the election. Only 51 percent of the Democrats said Mr. Gore was the favorite in their state, and just 27 percent called him a big favorite.
Among Republicans, 68 percent said Governor Bush was a favorite in their state and 44 percent said he had a big edge.
The Democratic poll had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points; the margin for the Republican survey was plus or minus two percentage points.
Mr. Lieberman's selection plainly made some Democratic delegates more hopeful.
Rosemary Trump, a labor organizer from Murrysville, Pa., who had called the Pennsylvania race a "tossup," said the Lieberman choice "will have a big impact."
"It's going to be a close election here in Pennsylvania, but this will energize those of us who feel empowered by this choice to work even harder," Ms. Trump said.
Stephen W. Long, a lawyer from Crestwood, Ky., had called his state a tossup as well. He said: "Lieberman being a moderate helps him here in Kentucky. I don't think the Jewish factor will be a problem at all here. His stances on taxes and education exemplify what Gore has been standing for and also strengthen Gore's personality as a straight shooter."
The surveys also showed major differences of sex, race and income in the two groups of delegates. Forty-eight percent of the Democrats are women, compared with 35 percent of the Republicans. Nineteen percent of the Democratic delegates, like 19 percent of Democratic voters, are African-American; 4 percent of Republican delegates are African-American, and 2 percent of Republican voters are.
While only 19 percent of all voters said their family incomes exceeded $75,000 last year, 57 percent of both Democratic and Republican delegates did. And 17 percent of Republican delegates, compared with 6 percent of Democrats, would not answer the question. Almost twice as many Republicans, 23 percent to 12 percent for Democrats, called themselves millionaires.
Thirty-one percent of Democratic delegates said they belonged to a labor union; only 4 percent of Republicans did. The median age of Democratic delegates was 51; for Republicans it was 53.
There was one major similarity on issues. Sixty-four percent of the public, with insignificant differences between Republicans and Democrats, said they thought the large, unregulated gifts to political parties from companies, unions and rich people, known as soft money, should be banned. Neither set of delegates was in step with that attitude. Republican delegates wanted them permitted, by 65 percent to 24 percent; Democratic delegates were split, with 44 percent wanting them allowed and 47 percent calling for a ban.
But more often one party or the other proved out of step with its own voters or the public. Among Democratic delegates, 83 percent said they favored affirmative action, compared with 51 percent of the public generally and 29 percent of Republican delegates. Deborah Goldberg, a Democratic delegate from Farmington, Mich., explained, "As long as there is discrimination, there should be affirmative action."
Democratic delegates strongly opposed tuition vouchers for private or religious schools, by 86 percent to 10 percent. Democrats in general were opposed, too, but only by 54 percent to 41 percent, and the public was about evenly split, with 47 percent in favor and 46 percent against. But Republican delegates, who favored vouchers by 71 percent to 20 percent, were almost as far out of step with the public uncertainty.
Democratic delegates were much closer to public attitudes than Republican delegates on questions of increasing safety and environmental regulation of business and requiring trigger locks on handguns. But while 73 percent of Democratic delegates said the government should do more to solve national problems, only 33 percent of the public did.
 
About the Survey
The New York Times/CBS News survey of delegates to the Democratic National Convention was conducted from July 6 to Aug. 10, mainly by telephone but also by fax, mail, e-mail message or Internet if individual delegates preferred.
Out of 4,339 Democratic delegates, 1,464 were randomly sampled with 1,042 completing the questionnaire by the end of polling.
A parallel Times/CBS News survey of delegates to the Republican National Convention was conducted from June 26 to July 28. Out of 2,066 Republican delegates, 1,551 were randomly sampled with 1,055 completing the questionnaire by the end of polling.
The results of each survey have been weighted to account for state delegation size, gender and the number of delegates pledged to each presidential candidate. In addition, the survey of Democrats was weighted by type of delegate.
In theory, in 19 out of 20 cases, the results based on such samples will differ by no more than plus or minus three percentage points for Democratic delegates, and plus or minus two percentage points for Republican delegates, from what would have been obtained by surveying all delegates to each convention.
The practical difficulties of conducting any survey may also introduce other sources of error. For instance, delegates varied in how difficult they were to reach. Also variations in question wording or the order of questions can lead to somewhat different results.
Results for voters are from nationwide Times/CBS News polls of the public taken during July.

HEADLINE: MEDIA;
Apology Highlights ABC Reporter's Contrarian Image

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG and FELICITY BARRINGER 

 BODY:
Last Friday evening on the TV news magazine "20/20," John Stossel, the square-jawed consumer and environmental correspondent, was forced to do something relatively rare for ABC News or any other network news operation: deliver an apology on the air for inaccuracies in a news feature.
What was not so rare, though, was Mr. Stossel's being in the thick of a controversy at ABC. He is a man of strong opinions, even about the work of his colleagues -- a trait that does not always go over well within the network's news division. 
 Last month, for instance, Mr. Stossel took aim at the environmentalist icon Erin Brockovich, the feisty legal secretary portrayed by Julia Roberts in a recent movie. On the program "20/20," he cast doubt on the lawsuit she helped bring charging Pacific Gas and Electric with contaminating the groundwater in Hinkley, Calif.
Mr. Stossel believed that his "20/20" co-anchor, Cynthia McFadden, among other reporters, had too blindly accepted Ms. Brockovich's case in an earlier ABC News report. So he discussed fighting it out with Ms. McFadden in a broadcast.
This made Ms. McFadden angry, people familiar with the situation said, and she complained loudly to her supervisors. She told colleagues she would refuse to appear on the program. When it was shown, Elizabeth Vargas was the anchor. The segment did not refer to Ms. McFadden's report.
Afterward, Ms. Brockovich demanded that Mr. Stossel apologize for his "dangerous and misleading broadcast." He did not.
All in all, just another day for Mr. Stossel. Reviled in some quarters as an ideologue and crusader, admired in others for his fresh, contrarian approach, Mr. Stossel is an anomaly in television journalism. Reporters are generally forced to keep their ideologies to themselves. Mr. Stossel is allowed to make his views known.
And that he does. An unabashed libertarian, he has argued that greed is good for the economy; that environmentalists are "scaremongers" with vastly overblown fears of global warming and pollution, and, even, that seat belts in school buses are a waste of money.
His views have put him under intense scrutiny in the hothouse world of environmental and consumer politics. And now an error made in a recent "20/20" segment -- in which he cited pesticide tests that were never done to debunk the assumed benefits of organic foods -- has put him under scrutiny by a wider audience while creating a public relations mess for ABC News. From now on, Mr. Stossel is likely to draw even more attention.
As coverage and criticism of Mr. Stossel spread last week, ABC, a unit of Walt Disney, took the rare step of publicly reprimanding him, and suspending the producer of the report, David W. Fitzpatrick, for one month, without pay. On "20/20" Friday night, Mr. Stossel apologized.
"I apologize for the error," he said, saying he mistakenly thought the tests referred to in the report had been conducted. "I am deeply sorry I misled you." But he said the gist of his report was accurate.
The whole episode sent jitters throughout ABC News, which recently took heat for allowing the actor Leonardo DiCaprio to interview President Clinton about environmental issues on a prime-time special, a move that split the division internally. Executives tried to figure out how the pesticide error made it through what they describe as an elaborate vetting process.
Shelley Ross, the executive producer of "Good Morning America," sent an e-mail to her staff members, warning them to take all complaints about their reports seriously. Mr. Stossel and his producer, the message said, were punished not so much for their mistake, "but for the arrogance of ignoring complaint letters that followed."
Environmentalists still insist that Mr. Stossel should be fired. But ABC executives said they would do no such thing.
By all appearances, they are fond of Mr. Stossel. His edgy, distinctive approach tests well in audience research. And, in fact, he is allowed to operate within the news division as a sort of island unto himself. He is given the sort of freedom no other ABC reporter has: though not labeled a commentator, he is allowed to take a point of view and report stories based on that point of view. He has his own unit of 8 to 10 staff members who help him with his weekly segments on "20/ 20," and with his various prime-time specials.
Last week, Mr. Stossel said he wanted to answer his critics directly, but ABC would not allow it, making Phyllis McGrady, an ABC News senior vice president, available instead.
Ms. McGrady said executives like Mr. Stossel's work because his reporting goes against the grain of the established media and offers the network something fresh and different. Though he avoids the traditional pose of objectivity, he bases his conclusions on hard reporting, she said. This hard-edged approach, she said, makes him a target of the powerful groups he offends.
"He's an original thinker, and he is not afraid to tackle complicated issues," she said. "He takes on issues that are thought-provoking and what he is wanting and hoping for and, yes, advocating for, is for you to become a freer thinker, to basically stand back and look at it from every perspective."
Mr. Stossel's point of view is welcomed by various conservative and industry groups. Though ABC has a general policy against paid public speaking engagements, as are some of his colleagues, Mr. Stossel is allowed to accept such offers. He was quoted in the March 2000 issue of Brill's Content magazine as saying he had spoken to 27 groups in the last two years, collecting hundreds of thousands of dollars in fees. An ABC executive said those engagements were approved because all of the money he collects went to charity.
Mr. Stossel is advertised, along with Charlton Heston, as one of the most sought-after speakers of the Young America's Foundation, a conservative group. This year, a spokesman for the Y.A.F. said, Mr. Stossel had given speeches at three schools, including Washington & Lee University, the Stetson School of Law in Florida and Florida State University.
His strong views, combined with speaking engagements before conservative groups, opens Mr. Stossel up to criticism. So heated is his opposition that FAIR, a liberal-minded media watchdog group, has an entire Web site devoted to what it sees as distortions.
As serious as the pesticide mistake was, there is a general belief within ABC News that the situation was worsened because of the lobbying prowess of the groups Mr. Stossel tends to provoke.
Still, the organic food mistake certainly played directly into Mr. Stossel's critics' accusations that he is biased and tailors his reporting and statistics to fit his fervent belief system -- in this case, that organic farmers are preying on fear of chemicals to sell overpriced food with its own problems.
During his initial report, shown on Feb. 4, to an audience of 12 million, Mr. Stossel said that tests commissioned by ABC showed conventional produce did not necessarily have more pesticide residue than did organic produce, debunking a main selling point for organic food.
But the two researchers who were commissioned by ABC -- Dr. Michael Doyle, a scientist at the University of Georgia, and Dr. Lester Crawford, director of the Center for Food and Nutrition Policy at Georgetown University -- said they had never tested produce for pesticide residue.
Dr. Crawford said that he had tested samples of organic and conventional chicken and that those tests had found traces of pesticides in the regular poultry, not in the organic. Those findings were not mentioned in the "20/20" segment.
After the report was first broadcast, advocates with the Environmental Working Group wrote a letter that alerted Mr. Stossel that the researchers said they had not conducted the tests. The report ran again on July 7 with the same information, however.
In fact, it was not until The New York Times raised the issue in a Media Talk column on July 31 that ABC News began to investigate the situation in earnest and found that the test results in question did not exist.
ABC executives said on Friday that they believed that the erroneous reference to pesticide tests was the result of honest mistake, though a serious one. There are valid explanations for all of the critics' charges, they said.
They said Mr. Fitzpatrick was receiving a spate of different test results on organic and conventional foods, had become confused and somehow had developed the solid notion that produce was tested for pesticide residue.
Even when he was contacted by the environmentalists, executives said, Mr. Fitzpatrick continued to believe that he had the results in question. In a subsequent conversation with Dr. Crawford, when Mr. Fitzpatrick asked if pesticide tests had been performed, Dr. Crawford answered in the affirmative. Dr. Crawford said in a recent interview that he did so because he was referring to the pesticide tests performed on chicken.
Why were the chicken tests, which would go against the grain of Mr. Stossel's argument, not included in the report? In his apology, Mr. Stossel said he did not refer to them because he was focusing on produce.
Michael Jacobsen, executive director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest -- whose group is supported by subcribers to its publications and by the Rockefeller Family Fund and the Park Foundation -- said though he found Mr. Stossel's erroneous organic food report egregious, he was not surprised by it. He said he believed it to be in keeping with what he sees as Mr. Sossel's bias in favor of industry.
That such an accusation could be attached to Mr. Stossel would have been unimaginable 10 years ago. His point of view has evolved drastically in the course of his career. Once a dogged consumer reporter for WCBS-TV, the local New York City CBS station, and then for ABC, he won his early reputation railing against corporate America. But in the early 1990's, his views changed. He evolved into a true believer in the free market and came to believe that advocates and the media were unnecessarily scaring consumers.
His transformation took place in an ideologically charged arena. Evidence about the impact of toxic substances on humans is hotly disputed.
But while Mr. Stossel's transformation has angered liberal groups, it has delighted conservative ones.
Walter Olsen, of the libertarian-oriented Manhattan Institite, said Mr. Stossel was now "filling in what we don't get from the rest of" the media. Other reporters, Mr. Olsen said, "have broadcast grossly misleading stuff over the years."
Though he apologized on night for the error, the gist of his statement was that his segment was still correct. The clear message from Mr. Stossel: despite this setback, he intends to continue his brand of journalism. But, he said in his apology: "All we have in this business is our credibility -- your trust that we get it right. I will make every effort to see that it never happens again."

HEADLINE: Unusually Severe Crackdown On Political Dissent in China

BYLINE: By CRAIG S. SMITH 

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, Aug. 13

 BODY:
Police activity has been increasing in several parts of China as the country undergoes a tightening of social controls ahead of the Oct. 1 National Day holiday.
While the summer sweep of discos and karaoke bars and the detention of people voicing political dissent happen every year, the crackdown appears unusually harsh this year. 
 It coincides with the annual gathering of Communist Party leaders in the northern seaside resort of Beidaihe, where growing social discontent and the economic challenges of China's planned entry into the World Trade Organization are expected to be high on the agenda.
China is climbing out of an economic slump in which its overall economic growth rate dipped by close to 7 percent last year. Several regions of the country went into a deep recession, leading to scattered unrest in heavily industrialized regions. Now a severe drought has increased disquiet among much of the country's rural population.
China's entry into the trade organization, expected later this year, will increase economic pressure on the bottom rung of the country's population as it struggles to compete with multinational corporations.
Following other reports of a crackdown on dissent in recent days, the police detained a reporter in central China after he talked to an American journalist about unrest among local farmers, a human rights group said today.
The Hong Kong-based Information Center for Human Rights and Democracy said that a Shaanxi Province television reporter, Ma Xiaoming, was picked up by the police after he met a journalist from an unspecified news organization to talk about farmers trying to sue the government. Mr. Ma was later released.
Farmers in the province have complained of exorbitant taxes and beatings by the local authorities. And the residents of eight poor Shaanxi villages are trying to free their lawyer, jailed last year after he went to Beijing to appeal to the central government on their behalf.
In Beijing, the police apparently continued to hold a poet and editor, Bei Ling, after they seized hundreds of copies of an independent literary journal he had edited, The Associated Press reported.
Mr. Bei disappeared Friday after telling friends he planned to hold a discussion forum that afternoon to review the August issue of his quarterly journal Tendency, which includes a photograph of the exiled Chinese dissident, Wang Dan, and a poem by a dissident literary critic, Liu Xiaobo.
And in Shanghai, police officers shut down several discos and bars for minor infractions in what the police described as a national campaign to clean up China's night life. Several establishments crowded with foreigners and Chinese have been raided by vanloads of uniformed police officers for no clear reason, and some have been told not to reopen until after Oct. 1.

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about a crackdown on political dissent in China misstated the change in China's economic growth rate last year, when a slump contributed to unrest in parts of the country. The rate of growth dipped from about 8 percent to about 7 percent; it did not fall by 7 percent.

HEADLINE: Fox Urges Opening of U.S.-Mexican Border to Build New Partnership

BYLINE: By GINGER THOMPSON 

DATELINE: SAN CRISTOBAL, Mexico, Aug. 13

 BODY:
Looking ahead to his first visit to the United States since winning Mexico's most democratic presidential election in 71 years, Vicente Fox said today that he would press American officials to open the border to Mexican workers and denounced the violence against them.
The President-elect said that when he meets later this month with President Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, he would also begin a dialogue about the formation of a North American common market. Referring to the successes of the European Union, Mr. Fox said that a common market would promote economic cooperation rather than competition. 
 "We will never be that good friend, that good neighbor, that good partner as long as Mexico is lagging way behind in development," Mr. Fox said. "I think it is a solidarity issue. It is a wisdom issue. It is a talent issue.
"I don't think the market, by itself, will do the job," he went on. "This job has to be done by the intelligence of people, by the intelligence of governments, by the talent of our nations."
Since his election, Mr. Fox has become a towering figure in Mexico, because he stands 6 foot 5 inches in his signature cowboy boots and because he is the first to seize the presidency from the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, in power since 1929. It was clear that even Mr. Fox marvels at the accomplishment. He declared his election on July 2 a "day of joy and happiness," and later showed off his quarter horse named for that date.
Relaxed and talkative, speaking in English, the President-elect met with American reporters at his mother's sprawling colonial hacienda to discuss his ideas for addressing some of the most contentious grievances in Mexico's relationship with the United States, including immigration, the fight against drug trafficking and corruption. At many points throughout the 90-minute meeting, he spoke with a candor rare among Mexican politicians about his country's failings and its continuing need for foreign assistance, and he encouraged American officials to do the same when he meets Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore on Aug. 24, and Governor Bush, the Republican presidential nominee, the following day in Texas.
In talking about immigration, Mr. Fox, a former executive for Coca-Cola in Mexico, called the labor force one of his nation's greatest assets. He said he would push for the creation of programs that would let Mexicans hold temporary jobs legally in the United States -- from unskilled gardeners to computer programmers.
"The United States also knows very well that it needs people to grow, that the United States economy cannot grow at rates of 5 percent or more if you don't have Mexicans there," Mr. Fox said.
"It is a country that was built up by immigrants," he said of his northern neighbor. "I don't know why today immigrants should be rejected."
Mr. Fox said he would tell Mr. Clinton that the violence against Mexican immigrants on American ranches along the border -- violence in which at least three immigrants have been killed this year -- is not fair.
And, he added, "we are more intelligent than to accept that as a fact."
He said he understood clearly that illegal immigration into the United States was largely caused by poverty, unemployment and hunger in Mexico, and in order to keep Mexican workers home, he said he intended to turn his campaign promises of 7 percent annual economic growth and 1.35 million new jobs a year into reality.
"It is not possible to have a harmonious, stable border," he said. "It is not possible to solve the migration problem if we don't solve the gap where a worker in Mexico earns $5 a day, and a worker in the United States makes $60 a day."
Mr. Fox went on: "Migration can be handled with different alternatives. By building up walls, by putting up armies, by dedicating billions of dollars like every border state is doing to avoid migration, is not the way to go."
Instead of reinforcing the border, Mr. Fox proposes slowly tearing it down by expanding the North American Free Trade Agreement into a treaty that creates an open market and a freer flow of services, goods and workers.
"In Europe, they don't compete within each other," he said, referring to the 15-nation European Union, in which citizens of any one country can work in any other member nation, and passport controls have also been largely abolished. "The countries that are involved, they are partners, so they take all the advantages that each one has and they put them together.
"I just can't imagine the huge potential of Mexico, the United States and Canada 20, 30, 40 years from now," he added. "The capacity of this bloc of nations would be the best in the world. We three countries would be absolute winners."
He said he plans to seek similar open-market agreements among some of the members of Mercosur -- Brazil, Argentina and Chile. Mexico and these three nations, he said, could be "the four machines" that could move Latin America forward and make it a real power in the 21st century.
Although he said that most of his meetings in Washington -- and in Dallas with Mr. Bush -- would be informal, he said he would strongly propose an end to the American drug-certification program. Under the program, the United States Congress annually certifies that Mexico and other individual Latin American countries where there is a substantial drug trade meet a set of standards for combating the illegal traffic. Those countries that do not meet the standards face an array of possible sanctions.
The program has long been criticized by Latin American presidents as interventionist. Mr. Fox said he considered the program ineffective. "It is not serving any purpose," he said. "Drug trafficking is growing, drug consumption in the United States is growing, the introduction of drugs to the United States is growing."
Mr. Fox also said that he would consider "very positively" American law enforcement efforts to win the extradition of suspected drug traffickers, an issue long the focus of acrimony between Mexico and Washington. And he promised that, under his government, it would be harder for criminals to bribe their way out of justice.
Summing up his hopes for his American visit, he said: "I want to approach the United States with intelligence. I don't want to approach it with pressures and complaints. I want to sit down with the United States and talk long term and short term, and to build, not to destroy."
In a rare moment of evasiveness, Mr. Fox backed away from questions about which of the American presidential candidates seems more of a friend to Mexico.
He said he had met previously with Mr. Bush, when Mr. Fox was governor of Guanajuato, and said he would meet Mr. Gore for the first time in Washington.
Both candidates, he said, have appeared interested in improving relations with Mexico, even if only for political reasons.
Asked to characterize relations between Mexico and the United States, he smiled and said: "The thing I have always said is that it is a difficult relationship. Sometimes we declare love for each other, but sometimes we give bear hugs -- too tight an embrace, and so someone gets hurt."

HEADLINE: Inventories Climbed 0.9% During June

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 14

 BODY:
The nation's companies, still trying to keep up with robust sales, increased inventories in June by a strong 0.9 percent, government figures showed today.
The increase in stockpiles of goods on shelves and backlots nationwide was faster than the 0.6 percent that many analysts expected. That lifted the total to a seasonally adjusted $1.19 trillion, the Commerce Department reported. 
 Supplies of oil and oil products -- the prices of which soared this summer -- climbed 4.7 percent, while drug inventories rose 3.1 percent.
June's overall increase was unchanged from the revised May figure of 0.9 percent, which earlier had been estimated at 0.8 percent -- the fastest pace in six months.
"The inventory numbers were pretty strong," said Joel Prakken, chairman of Macroeconomic Advisers, a forecasting firm in St. Louis.
At the same time, growing signs that the economy began to slow in the late spring and early summer, as evidenced last week in the Federal Reserve's latest survey of business activity nationwide, are "washing out" the effect of the inventory strength, Mr. Prakken suggested.
The portents of slower growth reinforce the expectation that the central bank will leave interest rates alone when its policy makers meet on Aug. 22, he said.
Business sales jumped 0.9 percent in June, to $904.2 billion, with oil and oil products, electrical goods, motor vehicles, automotive equipment and beer, wine and alcoholic beverages leading the way, an economic report released today showed.
The June sales increase slowed from a 1.1 percent jump in May.
The June rise in sales left the inventory-to-sales ratio unchanged but near a record low. The ratio stood at 1.32 in June, meaning it would take 1.32 months to use up inventories at the June sales pace. The ratio, which hit a record low of 1.31 months in March, was unchanged in June from May and down from 1.34 in June 1999.

Profits Surge at Big British Advertising Firm

BYLINE: By SUZANNE KAPNER

DATELINE: LONDON, Aug. 14

 BODY:
WPP Group, which will become the world's largest advertising firm with its acquisition of Young & Rubicam Inc., reported a surge in profits and revenue today and forecast that the boom in advertising spending would last through the end of the year, buoyed by the Olympics and the presidential election in the United States.
Several analysts, however, said the climate for big advertising firms like WPP is as good as it will get. 
 WPP, based in London, said operating profit for the first six months of the year grew 22 percent, to 146.5 million ($220 million), or 12 pence a diluted share, compared with 120 million, or 9.8 pence a diluted share, a year earlier.
Revenue rose 18 percent, to 1.2 billion, driven by new accounts, like SAP A.G., and increased spending from existing clients like the Ford Motor Company.
Including Young & Rubicam, which WPP is buying for $4.7 billion in stock, and excluding one-time merger costs, revenue increased 19 percent while operating profit jumped 28 percent.
Sir Martin Sorrell, WPP's chief executive, said shareholders would vote on the merger in September. Sir Martin sought to counter concerns that an expected slowdown in Internet advertising spending would dent WPP's growth prospects. He said that online spending tripled to 90 million, or about $135 million, during the first half of the year. What has changed, he said, is who is buying.
"Big traditional companies are spending more on the new economy, while new economy companies have had difficulties due to stock market falls and are spending less," Sir Martin said.
Going forward, analysts said the currently vibrant conditions for all types of advertising spending were unlikely to continue.
"Next year, you won't have the presidential elections or the Olympics or anything particularly big," said Gareth Thomas, an analyst at Commerzbank. "Even if the economy stays strong, the top line will slow. And the margin enhancements we've seen to date won't be replicated."
WPP has been preparing for an eventual slowdown by paying more employees on a bonus schedule and hiring more staff on contracts. Sir Martin said such flexible costs, which amount to 7 percent of revenue, could be easily cut if need be.
Shares of WPP, which owns the J. Walter Thompson and Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide advertising agencies along with the public relations firm Hill & Knowlton, rose as much as 2.4 percent on the earnings news, but fell back at the close of London trading to end down 0.11 percent at 907 pence, or about $13.60.

Shares Surge as Investors Bet Fed Will Keep Rates Steady

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Stocks staged a late-day rally yesterday as Wall Street bet that the Federal Reserve would keep interest rates steady next week after more than a year of tapping on the brakes to slow dynamic economic growth in the United States.
The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 148.34 points, or 1.4 percent, to close at 11,176.14, its highest finish since April 11. 
 On Friday, the Dow pierced the 11,000 level for the first time in three and a half months.
Money flowed into shares of interest-rate-sensitive financial services companies and retailers, giving the market a surge of energy.
"People are convinced that we're not going to have a rate hike, and that alone is enough to promote positive psychological buying patterns in the market," said Barry Hyman, market strategist for Ehrenkrantz, King, Nussbaum.
The Federal Reserve meets Aug. 22 to decide the fate of interest rates. The central bank has tightened monetary policy six times since last June, and Wall Street had begun to worry more increases would bite into corporate profits.
Technology shares also heated up, caught in the back draft as semiconductor shares rebounded from recent declines.
The Nasdaq composite index, weighted with technology shares, rose 60.22 points, or 1.6 percent, to 3,849.69, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500 index climbed 19.72 points, or 1.3 percent, to 1,491.56.
But the market's rally was tempered by modest trading volumes.
"It's difficult to get a great deal of excitement about the marketplace when a lot of the players are on the beach," said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Company.
J. P. Morgan & Company, helping to rally the Dow, gained 4 1/16, to 147 15/16, as investors anticipated positive news from the Fed and scooped up the shares of banks and brokerage firms.
Hewlett-Packard also bolstered the Dow, up 4 1/4, to 114 1/4. The company, the personal computer giant, to report earnings tomorrow.
On the Nasdaq, Dell Computer was the most active stock, falling 1, to 3611/16 , after analysts forecast a less robust second half for Dell, the world's No. 2 personal computer maker.
But computer chip makers gave the Nasdaq a jolt, and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange's semiconductor index rose 7.71 percent. The sector had suffered recently amid fears of a cyclical slowdown. Intel rose 3 1/8, to 66 15/16.
PathoGenesis, a biotechnology company, gained 5 7/32, to 37 31/32, after Chiron agreed to buy the company for $700 million, expanding its franchises in biopharmaceuticals, vaccines and blood testing. Chiron fell 1 15/16, to 46 11/16.
On the New York Stock Exchange, Micron Technology rose 4 3/4, to 80 1/2 after analysts upgraded the company, the world's second-largest chip maker.
Retailers also posted healthy gains. Home Depot, the world's largest home improvement retailer, rose 3 3/4, to 59 1/16. Earlier in the session, another home improvement retailer, Lowe's, posted a 21 percent increase in its second-quarter net income. Lowe's, which is not a Dow component, was up 3 1/16, to 46 13/16.
In other news, the TV station owner Chris-Craft Industries, jumped 17, to 79, after the News Corporation agreed to buy the company and its units for $5.35 billion.
Agilent Technologies, a test and measurement equipment maker, gained 2 15/16, to 43 9/16, after saying it would cut 640 jobs and overhaul operations at its troubled health care unit to return it to profitability.
Analysts said data on consumer prices scheduled for release tomorrow was expected to do little to shake confidence that the Fed's cycle of higher interest rates was drawing to a close.

HEADLINE: Democrats Hopeful in a Washington Race

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Aug. 14

 BODY:
It might be a stretch to say that Washington Democrats are paying rapt attention to next month's primary for United States senator, in which the state insurance commissioner, Deborah Senn, and former United States Representative Maria Cantwell, now a wealthy Internet executive promoting her experience in the "new economy," are battling for the right to take on the three-term Republican incumbent, Slade Gorton.
Indeed, even as Ms. Senn arrived here the other evening for a campaign speech to an electricians' union that had already endorsed her, several of the electricians said they could not name the candidates in the Sept. 19 primary, and they also labored a bit to identify the issues they considered most pressing in the contest. 
 "I'm not really going to focus on that till it's closer to the time to go out and vote," one electrician explained.
Another paused for several moments as he considered which issue was uppermost in his mind. "I don't know," he said. "I guess I really am interested in this whole Internet fight over what to do about Napster. So I'd like to see what they have to say about that."
And Ed Pecotte, a 57-year-old electrician from Port Orchard, Wash., seemed to sum up the mood of many at the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers when he said: "People are working, the economy seems to be humming along pretty well. I'd like to hear how these candidates intend to help things keep rolling along."
Despite a clear sense on the campaign trail that voters are just starting to concentrate on the race, the Democratic matchup shows signs of becoming an intriguing and bitterly fought contest. And the Washington Senate race is one that some national Democrats view as a prime opportunity for their party in its battle to take back control of the Senate, where Republicans have a 54 to 46 edge.
For Ms. Cantwell and Ms. Senn, the primary is the standard double-edged sword of such contests: the candidates will probably create a lot of publicity as the primary grows nearer but also risk draining their resources and energy in the battle, with the victor having barely a month and a half to shift gears for the main bout against the well-financed Mr. Gorton.
Ms. Senn got into the contest early, after several potential Democratic heavyweights, including Gov. Gary Locke, State Attorney General Christine Gregoire and Ron Sims, the county executive of King County, all took a pass on the race. (Mr. Locke is running for re-election, and Ms. Gregoire and Mr. Sims, who lost to Mr. Gorton seven years ago, seem to be interested in running for his job later.)
The 51-year-old Ms. Senn has racked up dozens of endorsements from labor groups, lawmakers and others, and frequently points out that she has won statewide races twice with more than one million votes, more than Mr. Gorton got in any of his seven statewide races.
Ms. Cantwell, on the other hand, enjoys the advantage of the millions of dollars she has earned as a software executive at Real Networks here, and, in some ways, getting booted out of Congress after one term in the 1994 Republican tide could turn out to be the best thing that ever happened to her politically. She has vowed to spend "whatever it takes" to unseat Mr. Gorton, 72, and also says she has "real world" private-sector experience with the Internet economy that, she says, makes her a stronger candidate than if she had stayed in Congress.
Under Washington's unusual "blanket primary" system, all candidates for Senate, including Mr. Gorton, will be on the ballot on Sept. 19, with the top vote-getter among Democrats, regardless of her percentage, surviving to face the incumbent on the November ballot. Any third-party candidate who receives more than 1 percent of the primary vote also makes the general election. This will almost surely be the last year Washington uses such a system, though. After a United States Supreme Court ruling in June threw out a similar primary system in California, state officials here are virtually certain to change the rules to withstand a similar challenge.
Ms. Cantwell, 41, has already been on the air with a series of television advertisements, describing her background and pledging to fight for ways to control the costs of prescription drugs, an issue that has emerged here, as in other states, as a major concern for many voters, especially older ones. With a fortune from stock options estimated to be worth at least $10 million and a declared willingness to spend her own money, the former congresswoman is likely to be firmly fixed in voters' minds by next month. And, for the moment anyway, she seems to be all but ignoring Ms. Senn, explaining that she can win only by making a much larger impression on the voters, not by dissecting her primary opponent's record.
"I look at this as a huge task of a cynical public that really doesn't want to hear too much about politics," Ms. Cantwell explained the other day after a campaign event in which she had appeared with Helen Jackson, the widow of former Senator Henry M. Jackson, to support an increase in federal conservation money. "So my challenge is bigger than Deborah Senn and Slade Gorton. It's convincing the public that you can make a difference in this process."
Ms. Senn said she had been battling insurance companies and fighting for lower drug costs for years in her state post, and she scoffed at Ms. Cantwell's interest in the subject.
"Now, with all that, with all the work we've done, I'm faced with Maria Cantwell on the air spending a million bucks, telling people she's going to solve their prescription drug problems," Ms. Senn said in an interview this week, after speaking to the electricians' union. "There's no record behind that ad. It is a promise, not performance."
But Ms. Cantwell said she had a record in Congress on all kinds of health care issues, and she has also made computer privacy a campaign issue, noting that she was a prime player in 1994 in fighting Clinton administration proposals, later dropped, that privacy advocates feared could increase government surveillance of computers.
Ms. Senn has attacked that stance, noting that Real Networks itself got into hot water a few years when it emerged that one of its software programs could store information on customers' preferences.
"A privacy pledge from Maria Cantwell is like having Jesse James promote bank security," she said.
While differing in some respects on free trade -- Ms. Cantwell was a strong supporter of the North American Free Trade Agreement, while Ms. Senn has said she would probably not have voted for the accord in the form that came before Congress -- the candidates agree on many other issues. And they both identify health care, education and the environment as major campaign themes. For that matter, so does Senator Gorton.
Democrats say Mr. Gorton, who has been in public life almost continuously for more than 30 years, is more conservative than most Washington residents and thus vulnerable to an upset this November. He has failed to get a 50 percent approval rating in some polls, another sign of hope for the Democrats.
Gauging the candidates' support at this juncture is tricky, since voters are just starting to pay attention and Ms. Senn, who has raised $1.6 million and will probably have less to spend than Ms. Cantwell, has yet to start running television advertisements. The Democratic candidates are not scheduled to debate until next month. A statewide poll last month of 400 registered voters by Stuart Elway, an independent pollster, found 21 percent supporting Ms. Cantwell and 12 percent for Ms. Senn, with 42 percent for Mr. Gorton and most of the rest undecided.
All three candidates do have at least one thing in common: they were reared in the Midwest.
If Mr. Gorton loses, Patty Murray, a Democrat, will become the senior senator and Washington will become the third state, after California and Maine, to have two women in the Senate. Just over 40 percent of Washington's state lawmakers are women, the highest percentage in any state legislature in the nation's history.

Accountability At Prisons Run Privately

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY

 BODY:
WHEN inmates rampaged in 1995 at a privately run detention center for immigrants in Elizabeth, N.J., many critics said it demonstrated the dangers of letting corporations run prisons. In retrospect, though, you could draw a quite different conclusion.
The conditions at the center, run by Esmor Correctional Services under contract from the Immigration and Naturalization Service, were deplorable, but so were the conditions at other detention centers run by the federal government itself. The uprising, which destroyed property but produced no serious injuries, was mild compared with riots at public prisons. 
 What made the story unusual was what happened after the rampage. Several of the guards and supervisors were promptly fired by the company. Then, barely a month after the uprising, the whole company was fired by the government.
The I.N.S., while declining to discipline its own bureaucrats for what it called mistakes in oversight, ended the contract with Esmor and closed the center. The site was overhauled and reopened a year later by a more experienced company, the Corrections Corporation of America, which is still running it to the satisfaction of the I.N.S.
Can you think of any public prison where the entire staff was fired? Can you think of one where anybody was fired? After a typical scandal, at best you see a blue-ribbon commission report that might lead to some policy changes in a year or two.
At worst, you see the response of New York officials to the prison scandal that came to light last week. State officials acknowledge that they wrongly imprisoned Kerry Sanders, a homeless, mentally ill California man, from 1993 to 1995 because he was misidentified as an escaped convict, but they have yet to discipline anyone or announce any reforms.
Private companies can't afford the luxury of inaction, and not merely because their contracts can be canceled. Any scandal has immediate consequences on their reputation (the price of Esmor's stock plummeted after the uprising in Elizabeth) and their prospects for getting future business.
A scandal also has an immediate effect on their premiums for liability insurance, a special concern for private companies. Public officials enjoy immunity against many lawsuits by inmates, and even if they lose, the money usually doesn't come out of their budgets. Private executives can be sued more readily and must pay the consequences. Private firms also typically indemnify the government against any lawsuits involving their facilities.
THOSE incentives have led to better conditions at private correctional institutions than at public ones, as researchers have found by analyzing records and interviewing residents and staff members.
Richard F. Culp, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, who compared more than 200 juvenile correctional facilities across the country, reported significantly less crowding, better morale and fewer problems at private institutions. His 1998 findings jibe with those of earlier studies, including one by the Urban Institute and another by Charles H. Logan, a sociologist at the University of Connecticut, who compared federal prisons.
After reviewing the academic literature, Dr. Culp suggested that private prisons, often justified mainly to reduce operating costs, might be more important for the improved treatment they provide. In the long run, he concluded, the most important savings may be in "reduced prison reform litigation and improved rehabilitative outcomes."
Adrian T. Moore, an economist at the Reason Public Policy Institute, reached a similar conclusion after surveying research on private prisons.
"There's no evidence that conditions in private prisons are worse than in public ones, and there's growing evidence that conditions are better," he said. "People like to say that private prisons aren't accountable, but they're actually more accountable than public ones."
Mr. Moore was not surprised to hear of the casual reaction by New York prison officials to wrongfully imprisoning a man for two years.
"It reminds me of the Los Angeles County Jail, which until last year still kept inmate files on paper, not computers, and continually held inmates past their release date," he said. "As in New York, no one was ever held accountable. There was another scandal at a California prison where guards were staging gladiator fights among prisoners, but the only person to lose his job was the whistle-blower."

BROOKLYN: WEST NILE VIRUS DETECTED
Evidence of West Nile virus has been found in Brooklyn for the first time this year, leading city officials to prepare plans for spraying pesticides in Brooklyn as early as Thursday night. An infected dead crow was picked up on Aug. 3 in the Canarsie section, with the positive confirmation of the virus coming just yesterday, officials said. The infection has now been found in all five boroughs. Details of the spraying may be announced as early as today, officials said. Eric Lipton (NYT) 

BEACON: SEEGER'S BANJO MISSING
A $1,000 banjo handmade by Pete Seeger, the folk singer, is missing and presumed stolen. Mr. Seeger, 81, traveled to Rosendale in Ulster County with his banjo last Tuesday and is not sure how or when it disappeared from his car. Mr. Seeger performed at the Beacon Corn Festival here in Dutchess County on Sunday. Mr. Seeger recorded his song "Where Have All The Flowers Gone" with the 55-year-old banjo. He is offering a $1,000 reward. (AP)
 
MANHATTAN: NAZI DEPORTATION
An immigration judge yesterday ordered a former Nazi guard deported to Austria. The former guard, Michael Gruber, 85, of New City, in Rockland County, persecuted civilians at the Sachsenhausen concentration camp, the Justice Department charged. Judge Robert D. Weisel ruled that the government had proved its case and that Mr. Gruber must be called to account. Robert Murtha, Mr. Gruber's lawyer, said his client, who he said was ill, never committed war crimes. Mr. Murtha said he hoped appeals would delay deportation for the rest of his client's life. Julian E. Barnes (NYT)
 
BROOKLYN: INJURED POLICEMEN SENT HOME
Two of the four police officers who were shot in a gun battle with a deranged former prison guard on Saturday were discharged from the hospital yesterday. Officers Gregory John and Joseph Ocasio left Kings County Hospital Center and were both recuperating at home, officials said. The most seriously injured officer, Jose Guerra, was transferred to the Downstate Medical Center, where he underwent surgery yesterday and was sitting up and speaking last night. The fourth officer, James McGrath, was treated and released immediately after the shootout, in which the gunman, Arthur Alalouf, died. C.J. Chivers (NYT)
 
SYRACUSE: BILLIONS SOUGHT IN INDIAN CLAIM
An economist said yesterday that the Cayuga Indian Nation should receive $1.7 billion in interest dating to 1795 for being deprived of its ancestral homelands for more than two centuries. The economist, Peter Temin, testified in behalf of the Cayugas, who, a jury ruled, were illegally deprived of 64,027 acres of land in Cayuga and Seneca Counties by New York State in 1795 and 1807. Mr. Temin said his calculations were based on an estimate of rent from the land invested in Treasury bonds. Earlier, the jury awarded the Cayugas $36.9 million as the fair market value of the land. Interest on that amount is to be set by the judge. (AP)
 
NEW HARTFORD: $35 MILLION SHOPLIFTING RING
Two more defendants in a $35 million shoplifting ring were sentenced yesterday to incarceration. Anthony Carcone, 59, of Utica, was sentenced to one to three years in state prison and Laurie Malozzi, 39, of Utica was sentenced to five months in the Oneida County jail. In June, five members of the shoplifting ring that operated in 11 counties were sentenced. (AP)

WATERBURY: WELFARE OFFICIAL ARRESTED
A veteran supervisor in the State Department of Social Services has been arrested and charged with embezzling more than $190,000 from Connecticut's welfare program, the chief state's attorney, John M. Bailey, said yesterday. From January 1998 to last month, the supervisor, Helen Pearl Byrd, 66, of Waterbury, illegally credited more than $190,000 in welfare benefits to the account of Griselle Ramirez, 28, a welfare recipient, Mr. Bailey said. Ms. Ramirez would then split the money with Ms. Byrd, Mr. Bailey added. Both women were arrested and charged with larceny. David M. Herszenhorn (NYT)
 
HARTFORD: FLOOD RELIEF SOUGHT
Gov. John G. Rowland is seeking federal disaster relief aid for Fairfield County, which flooded during weekend rainstorms. Governor Rowland wrote a letter to President Clinton requesting financial aid for businesses ruined by flash floods on Friday and Saturday, as well as for some homeowners. The aid would provide low-interest loans to flood victims. Mr. Rowland has also asked the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Small Business Administration to assess flood damage in Stratford and other areas in the county. Paul Zielbauer (NYT)
 
NEW HAVEN: RECORD TEACHER HIRINGS
Public school systems in Connecticut are in the midst of a hiring boom not seen since the 1950's, new figures show. Last year, 62 percent of new teachers got jobs within a year of obtaining their certification, according to the State Education Department. In 1982, barely 22 percent of graduates got jobs the first year. (AP)
 
NEW JERSEY
 
TRENTON: TAX CREDIT FOR POOR
Gov. Christine Todd Whitman yesterday signed into law a new state earned-income tax credit in addition to the federal earned-income tax credit. Nearly 240,000 families who earn $20,000 or less a year and have children can claim on their tax returns an additional 20 percent credit of up to $800. Families that do not have taxable income can claim the credit as a refund. The plan, costing nearly $100 million a year, will be phased in over four years. (NYT)

Skip Instant Replay In New Football Movie

BYLINE: By Richard Sandomir

 BODY:
Remember scab football? Remember the fun? Those golden moments? The talent? The dignity?
Of course not. The players who replaced the striking National Football League players in 1987 did not distinguish themselves and faded quickly.
Union-busting made lousy football and worse television. 
 But, hey, wash away those dingy old memories and leap into fantasy with the upbeat new film "The Replacements." Here, greedy, boorish union players are replaced during a strike by a lovable, hungry bunch of lugs from Washington, D.C., who bond as a unit while singing "I Will Survive" in a jail cell, win the hearts of a grateful metropolis and beat Dallas to make it to the playoffs.
(Great film idea: the fuzzy, warm side of thugs working for the Ford Motor Company who beat Walter Reuther and other union organizers in 1937.)
"The Replacements" is "Rudy" and "Major League" rolled into one anti-union comedy starring Gene Hackman as the coach, who has now gone from coaching fresh-faced high schoolers in "Hoosiers" to leading a team with a convict in some kind of modern correctional reform: a scab football work-release program. "They have been part of something great," Hackman says at the end.
 Not surprisingly, the N.F.L. refused to sanction "The Replacements." Its refusal to grant Warner Brothers a license forced the filmmakers to create team names, like the Washington Sentinels, and to fashion new uniforms.
"We didn't think it made sense to remind people of our 1987 strike," said Greg Aiello, a spokesman for the league. No doubt the league would not have been elated to see a replacement player use a pistol to shoot out the windows of the striking quarterback's expensive foreign car.
The league's refusal to sanction the film did not keep the Maryland Stadium Authority from seeking the Baltimore Ravens' go-ahead to let the producers use PsiNet Stadium. "We O.K.'d it because they felt it would be good for the economy of the community," said Kevin Byrne, a spokesman for the Ravens.
(Short historical tidbit: during the 1987 strike, Art Modell, who owned the Cleveland Browns then and owns the Ravens now, said, "There are no circumstances under which free agency will work.")
The N.F.L. Players Association contemplated protesting the making and the opening of the film, but thought better of calling attention to it.
"The strike was a dark period for players and to make a comedy out of it is unfair to its importance in the lives of our players," said Doug Allen, the union's assistant executive director. "Anyone who cooperated with this movie perpetuates a revisionist and unfair view of history that is denigrating to N.F.L. players who were fighting for the right to choose where they work."
In "The Replacements," issues are never discussed. But hiring strippers to be cheerleaders is.
"The Replacements" has two familiar faces: Pat Summerall and John Madden. The Fox announcers called N.F.L. replacement games in 1987 when they worked at CBS, and call the film's games.
Summerall and Madden were contractually bound to call those real-life strike games, but chose to play along with the charade in the film.
"They looked at it as an entertainment," said Sandy Montag, who represents both men. "They didn't view themselves as an ex-player and an ex-coach, but as announcers."
In the film, Summerall seems more himself than Madden, whose hyperactive style of analysis seems half as fast as usual. When they see the film, they may be a smidgen surprised to see some of their game commentary diverted for use as narration for a love scene. Oops!
At one point in the film, Madden, as Madden, says, "I never thought I'd say this, but I'm going to miss those replacement games."
Frankly, I never thought I'd hear him say that either.
Dan Dierdorf, a CBS N.F.L. analyst and former St. Louis Cardinals union rep, said he received an early inquiry about being in the film. He said, "But the N.F.L. wasn't behind it, and I was of the opinion that it would not be a smart thing to do."
 
Lightweight 'Regional'
Yes, it is possible for a four-minute local sports report by Len Berman or Warner Wolf to be more substantial than Fox Sports Net's new half-hour "Regional Sports Report." A viewing of the first two Sunday editions reveals the program as lightweight and stretched thin; the first Sunday, the anchors Steve Cangialosi and Mike Hill made elementary errors.
This past Sunday, Cangialosi settled into the role of audience for Hill's subpar imitation of ESPN's Stuart Scott, whose style and personal highlight language are behind his popularity, and Van Earl Wright, a bellowing anchor on FSN's "National Sports Report." Shouting scores and spewing three strained similes a minute is not a sports report -- it's amateur night at the Improv. And yes, anchormen, we've seen those fashionable T-shirts; now it's time to dress up.
 
Terrific Olbermann 'News'
But there are better things from Fox Sports Net: its search for a distinctive show is over: the new Sunday night "Keith Olbermann Evening News" is a sophisticated and occasionally silly vacation from "SportsCenter" or the "National Sports Report." The program is Olbermann's innovative circus, where he juggles essays, field reports and interviews from his retro perch in what could have been Grantland Rice's office. This past Sunday featured a terrific report on the actors' strike against television commercial production and the decision by Tiger Woods and Kurt Warner to cross picket lines to star in their own ads.

HEADLINE: In Assembly Race, Power of Incumbency Vies With a Household Name

SERIES: NEW YORK PRIMARY -- 68th Assembly District

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
After years of unsuccessful campaigns in the rough-and-tumble politics of East Harlem, usually losing by a hair, Nelson Antonio Denis finally won a seat in the Assembly in 1996. Establishing himself as a reformer and an articulate debater, he coasted easily to re-election two years later.
While many Manhattan politicians anticipated that Mr. Denis would have another comfortable election this year, the assemblyman is instead facing a formidable race. Over the last month an opponent has emerged in the Democratic primary: former City Councilman Adam Clayton Powell 4th. 
 Mr. Powell, 38, the son of the late Harlem congressman, represented much of the same area of Manhattan in the City Council for six years, before leaving that body at the end of 1997. Mr. Powell decided not to seek re-election to the Council, instead taking on an unsuccessful race for Manhattan borough president. He came in third in a field of six candidates in the Democratic primary.
Despite that loss, Mr. Powell's name is one of the most recognized in Manhattan and this Assembly district is virtually a stone's throw from the prominent Harlem boulevard that bears his famous father's name.
The primary in the 68th Assembly District is being watched closely by politicians in Manhattan because it will test how firm a grip Mr. Denis has developed on incumbency. Long the political outsider fighting established officials, the 45-year-old assemblyman is now the incumbent who regularly bombards district residents with mailings chock full of news of his stewardship. Mr. Powell is now the outsider as he seeks to regain his political footing.
The two men agree on a number of issues. Both speak about the need for increased financial support from Albany for New York City's schools.
The two men agree on a number of issues. Both speak about the need for increased financial support from Albany for New York City's schools. And they speak about the need to provide increased housing for poor and elderly residents of the district, and about the need to get aid from the state to jumpstart the economic health of the district.
What they disagree on is on the fitness of the other to serve in the Assembly.
"A lot of the people in the district have been asking me to get back into political leadership," Mr. Powell said in an interview. "They try calling his office and no one even answers the phone. We have someone in Nelson Denis who is missing in action. I can help the people in this area to get decent representation."
Indeed, Mr. Powell's candidacy centers on one basic theme: that Mr. Denis is inattentive to the needs of the district and does a poor job serving his constituents.
Mr. Denis in turn described Mr. Powell's candidacy as one lacking in rationale. He said that, while Mr. Powell might enjoy great name recognition, he lacked the leadership ability to be effective. He also said that Mr. Powell's 1997 endorsement of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani would not sit well with the voters in this heavily Democratic district.
"It's an interesting paradox," Mr. Denis said. "You have a very full legacy of one of the most effective legislators in history," he said of Mr. Powell's father. "But then you have the son, who is trading on that. Adam is running on fumes. There is no gas there."
Mr. Denis, countering Mr. Powell's criticisms, said he has been responsible for increased financial support from Albany to programs in the district ranging from health clinics to cultural organizations. "We have served the people of this community in housing, in welfare, in sanitation concerns," Mr. Denis said. "My office has set a standard for constituent services."
In the years since he left the Council, Mr. Powell has worked most recently with the Federal Emergency Management Agency as a disaster assistance field worker. Immediately after his Council term ended, he turned to political consulting and real estate development in Puerto Rico, where he was born and raised.
While Mr. Powell might be helped by political legacy, Mr. Denis has roots that are deep in the community, too. A graduate of Harvard University and Yale Law School, Mr. Denis worked as director of strategic planning with the Harlem Community Development Corporation before being elected. On the weekends, he operated a free legal clinic for neighborhood residents. He twice lost attempts to unseat Angelo Del Toro, the East Harlem assemblyman who died in 1995, coming within 160 votes in 1994.
Mr. Denis and Mr. Powell have had a political relationship characterized by a series of hot and cold phases. Some years ago, they were strong political allies who worked for each other's various campaigns. But, after a series of disagreements, they are now in a decidedly icy phase.
The 68th Assembly District is anchored in East Harlem, although it includes a small pocket on the Upper West Side. The district is roughly half Hispanic and about 40 percent black, with non-Hispanic white residents making up most of the rest.
The contest promises to be one not likely to be remembered for civility. Already, Mr. Powell's campaign literature talks about how he has spent the last few years assisting people who were beset by disasters. Now, a campaign flier states, Mr. Powell is back "to help the people of our community cope with a disaster closer to home" -- referring to Mr. Denis.
Mr. Denis said he has already raised $25,000 for the race, about double what he spent two years ago. Mr. Powell said he has raised nearly $20,000. Both men say they might well raise another $10,000 or more.
There are two other candidates in the primary: Frank Acosta, a local businessman who ran against Mr. Denis two years ago, and Walter Torres, who was once a political ally of Mr. Denis's. In a tight race, the presence of additional candidates could well affect the outcome.
Still, both Mr. Powell and Mr. Denis say they see themselves as the front-runner.
"The reality," Mr. Powell contends, "is that I can't see how the other guy wins. I'm not the average insurgent."
Mr. Denis says that every race he has undertaken has been difficult, and that he expects this one to be no different.
"I approach every race as though I am running from behind," he said. "Although, in this one, I'm really in front."

HEADLINE: THE DEMOCRATS;
In Mrs. Clinton's Speech: Praise of Gore's Leadership

 BODY:

Following is an excerpt from remarks last night by Hillary Rodham Clinton at the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles, as recorded by The New York Times:
I am so proud to stand here at this extraordinary moment, the most peaceful, prosperous, promising time in our nation's history. 
 Now, how can we continue America's progress? By electing Al Gore and Joe Lieberman the next president and vice president of the United States.
You know, even before he was vice president, I admired Al for his leadership in the Senate, his understanding of the future, his pioneering efforts to fight environmental threats that affected our children, his work with Tipper to promote responsible parenting -- and what great parents the two of them are.
I've watched him as Bill's trusted partner in the White House. Together, they made the hard decisions to renew our nation's economy and our national spirit; to advance democracy and defend freedom around the world. And I can't wait until we watch Al Gore take the oath of office on Jan. 20, 2001.
And standing next to him will be his wonderful wife and my dear friend, who inspires us through her work for the homeless and her advocacy on behalf of mental health. Tipper Gore will make a great first lady.
And the country has seen again Al Gore's leadership in his choice of Joe Lieberman.
I first met Joe 30 years ago when Bill and I were law students. We saw then what America sees now: a person of uncommon wisdom and integrity. I admire Joe's work to reduce the violence in our media. And I appreciate his steadfast support for a woman's right to choose.
And with him is his remarkable wife, Hadassah, the immigrant daughter of Holocaust survivors. Their story tells our children that in America, no dream is beyond our reach.
You know, in 1992, Bill and Al promised to put people first. That simply meant that when people live up to their responsibilities, we ought to live up to ours and give them the tools and opportunities they need to build better lives. That's the basic bargain at the heart of the American dream.
From a stronger economy to more Americans attending college to a cleaner environment, Bill Clinton and Al Gore have put people first. And not only that, they put children first.
More children lifted out of poverty.
More children receiving Head Start, child care and after-school care.
More children than ever getting immunized against disease.
More children whose parents can take family and medical leave to care for them.
And more neglected and abused foster children being adopted into loving, permanent homes.
Children like Dianna, who came to a White House ceremony I held spotlighting the needs of children in foster care. Just 12 years old, not much younger than Chelsea at the time, she spent most of her life moving from house to house. She was so shy she could barely look up as she spoke of her longing for a home and family of her own.
As I listened, I thought, "How can we let any child grow up in our country without a secure and loving home?"
I worked with a bipartisan coalition to help double the number of foster children adopted.

In L.A., Mrs. Clinton Is Ready for Her Close-Up

BYLINE: By ELEANOR RANDOLPH

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
The setting for the Clinton rally in Hollywood Sunday afternoon was more reminiscent of the first couple's Arkansas past than their New York future. It was the small-town Main Street created for the Sony Pictures Studio, a place where Hillary Rodham Clinton slipped somewhat too easily into her old supporting role as first lady. After more than a year of establishing her own political identity in New York, with only five months to go in the Clinton presidency, she was once again doing her dutiful first lady act, performing a downbeat opening routine for her highly oratorical husband.
True to form, she gave an earnest, efficient, plain speech to this Hollywood group before turning over the microphone. True to form, he made her look like a novice. Still, when the candidate for the Senate spoke, people listened; as the president spoke, his audience began to slip away at the edges. 
 This moment on an ersatz street in the capital of make-believe underscored one real-life, if largely unspoken, truth about the couple that have dominated Democratic consciousness for almost a decade. He has always been the Clinton with the talent to win people over, to dazzle them with empathy, to make the Hollywood crowd envy his glamour and open their checkbooks. But this week in Los Angeles, the party faithful are going through a collective act of realization. At long last, Hillary has one thing he doesn't -- a future.
"Now comes the time when she has to talk about who she is, what kind of person she is, what she thinks about issues and what she would do as senator," says Randi Weingarten, president of the United Federation of Teachers. Like most of Mrs. Clinton's ardent New York supporters, Ms. Weingarten insists that she has full confidence in the first lady's abilities to wow her audiences, to convince them of her solid credentials, her stands on the issues.
But the reality is that Mrs. Clinton is but a few days away from shedding the first lady role more fully than ever and moving into the territory of the full-time candidate who will have to rely on her own talents and resources more than on borrowed charisma.
Like Vice President Al Gore, Mrs. Clinton has to move out more solidly on her own, holding onto the economic progress in the last eight years while shedding the sleazier stuff that is clearly a more complicated part of her life than the vice president's.
Last weekend in Hollywood rubbing shoulders with movie stars and moguls raises money at the same time that it revives the questions about the Clintons' attraction to glitter and old memories of Monica Lewinsky's hometown. Back home in New York, Mrs. Clinton's opponent Rick Lazio was making the connection by holding a press conference at Planet Hollywood in New York City.
Also like Vice President Gore, Mrs. Clinton is enjoying the rush of support coming from his choice of Senator Joseph Lieberman as his running mate. A Democratic candidate in New York State usually needs about 70 percent of the Jewish vote. Before the Lieberman choice, only about half of the state's Jewish Democrats were supporting the first lady. "It's hard to imagine a more helpful choice for her," said Victor Kovner, a New York City Democratic Party loyalist who sees the choice as a tie-breaker in this race. "The Jewish community will come home to their party."
While Mr. Lieberman may also activate the Orthodox vote that is heavily conservative, Mrs. Clinton seems confident that she will make a net gain from his presence on the New York ballot. All weekend, she has used the Lieberman name like a protective mantra, even letting it be known that she agrees with many of the Connecticut senator's concerns about too much violence in the entertainment fare churned out by her big donors here.
While paying tribute to her husband and Mr. Gore, the first lady delivered what was essentially her own campaign speech. She has seemed determined to create a new aura of independence in Los Angeles -- not only at the fund-raisers but also in the many media interviews with anchors big-time and small. It was she, for example, who announced the pullback in the first couple's interview schedule when it became clear that their efforts to upstage Mr. Gore were turning into a public-relations disaster.
Her other appearances here were intended to do more than raise money. She also wanted to make the point that the New York Senate campaign was a contest on issues -- abortion, the economy, gun control -- where she fits more easily with the state's majority than Mr. Lazio.
In a way, then, this convention marks Mrs. Clinton's graduation from the campaign-worker phase of her life to the politician phase. That gave a special resonance to the words that she spoke to a worshipful crowd of Democratic women in a jammed ballroom of the Wilshire Grand Hotel. "We are not going back," she said. "we are not keeping quiet. We are not giving up. We intend to take our rightful place at the table." Mr. Clinton was not in the audience, but you have to wonder if he checked the transcript.

HEADLINE: Mr. Clinton's Valedictory

 BODY:
In an emotional farewell to the party that he reshaped and led for eight turbulent years and to the political arena he will clearly miss, President Clinton last night offered a passionate defense of his record and a steadfast argument that Vice President Al Gore is ready to take over. As students of convention staging will no doubt remember, the president chose an oddly hokey gladiatorial entrance. For fans of presidential oratory, the speech was a reminder of Mr. Clinton's skills as an advocate who can both speak from the heart and argue a case through a series of logical points. The Democrats' enthusiastic reception was testimony to their mixed feelings -- an eagerness to move beyond Mr. Clinton and his outsized personal problems as well as genuine gratitude for his success in modernizing their party.
Mr. Clinton's valedictory appearance, on the first day of the convention, was aimed at letting the president make a best-case argument for his stewardship, before the party turns to the hard work of pushing Mr. Gore and his running mate, Senator Joseph Lieberman, across the finish line. Mr. Clinton paid tribute to Mr. Gore's steadiness under pressure and his knowledge of government in arguing that the vice president deserved considerable credit for the successes of the last eight years. He also portrayed Mr. Gore as the most future-oriented politician in the country in regard to science, technology and education issues. 
 Mr. Clinton dealt with his personal scandals by not mentioning them. He apparently decided that this was not going to be a moment of contrition or one when the headline writers and Republicans would have another mea culpa with which to work. Instead he dwelt on his gratitude to the voters for letting him serve in the White House.
As he did in recent interviews, Mr. Clinton also made it clear that Republican convention oratory about an era of accidental and purposeless prosperity had nettled him mightily. In response to recent sallies from the G.O.P. nominee, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, Mr. Clinton pointed out that when the administration enacted its economic strategy of trying to close the budget deficit, even by raising taxes on the richest Americans, the Republican leadership in Congress voted uniformly against it and predicted it would bring about economic ruin. "Time has not been kind to those predictions," he declared. Indeed, as he pointed out, it was Mr. Gore who supplied the tie-breaking vote in the Senate.
The president's most explicit effort to sell Mr. Gore as a presidential-scale leader came in a personal testimony to him as "one strong leader" who is capable, indeed eager to make "tough choices." He also praised Mr. Lieberman, noting that he had known the Connecticut senator since working for his first state legislative campaign while a law student 30 years ago. And when Mr. Clinton reminded the audience of his own personal journey to the White House from a small-town boyhood, he seemed to be trying to contrast himself with the pampered upbringing of Governor Bush, who is seen by many Americans as a man they can empathize with more than Mr. Gore. In an emotional touch, he spoke of the gray hair and wrinkles that now mark his visage, but have not dimmed "optimism and hope I brought to the work I love eight years ago."
One of the strongest flashes of irritation from Mr. Clinton came when he defended his administration's record on military and preparedness issues. At the Philadelphia convention the Republicans charged relentlessly that American defenses had declined in the last eight years, ignoring the fact that military budgets had started to go down under President Bush and have gone back up in the last several years. Mr. Clinton boasted that the United States had expanded human rights in the tradition of former President Jimmy Carter, who was sitting in the audience, and then went on to suggest that the Republicans were inviting trouble from overseas with their accusations. Any foreign country inspired by the Republican Party to think that America is not ready to defend itself, he said, would be gravely mistaken.
In a sense, the last convention of any two-term president can be called the end of an era. But there is no doubt that this farewell will be remembered by every living Democrat as an unforgettable time. In party terms, Mr. Clinton's great accomplishment was to update the liberal policies that let the Democrats dominate midcentury politics but that became a straitjacket when Ronald Reagan arrived on the scene. There will always be the sadness that the Clinton record will forever be blotted because his leadership gifts were offset by a self-destructive streak at the center of his personality. For all that, Mr. Clinton will go into party history as the only politician of his decade with a personal magnetism and communicative skills to match those of Mr. Reagan and Mr. Clinton's own boyhood idol, John F. Kennedy.

Meetings on Empire Zones

BYLINE: By Joseph P. Fried

 BODY:
New York State will hold three meetings for officials who hope to have economically troubled areas of their municipalities designated as economic development zones, in which the state provides financial incentives to businesses that move to or expand in the areas. 
 Last month, Gov. George E. Pataki signed legislation authorizing the creation of six such zones, which would be added to the 52 already designated from Brooklyn to Buffalo. State officials say that at least 125,000 people have been employed at more than 2,600 businesses helped by the Empire Zones Program, which provides substantial state tax credits and other aid to businesses that invest in the areas. The meetings are to be held on Thursday at the Empire State Plaza in Albany; on Monday at the agency's offices at 633 Third Avenue in Manhattan; and on Aug. 24 at the Rochester Institute of Technology in Rochester.

HEADLINE: THE DEMOCRATS: THE OVERVIEW;
CLINTON, OPENING CONVENTION, SAYS GORE WILL PROTECT LEGACY

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Aug. 14

 BODY:
President Clinton savored what he called "this moment of unprecedented good fortune" and, in a nostalgic valedictory tonight, implored Americans to protect his achievements by electing Al Gore to succeed him.
"One of the very best decisions of my entire life," he said, was "asking Al Gore to be my partner." 
 While Mr. Clinton made no direct mention of Gov. George W. Bush during his address on the opening night of the 43rd Democratic National Convention, he scoffed at the recent suggestion by the Republican nominee that the nation had stumbled into prosperity. Transcript, Page A17.
"To those who say -- and I'm sure you've heard this somewhere in the last few days -- the progress of these eight years was just some sort of accident that we just coasted along, let me be clear: America's success was not a matter of chance," Mr. Clinton said in a swan song that lasted about 40 minutes. "It was a matter of choice."
Mr. Clinton made no allusions to the personal scandals he has weathered; at a church last week, the president said his transgressions should not tar Mr. Gore. Instead, Mr. Clinton catalogued the high points of his entire two terms, the longest presidential tenure of a Democrat since Franklin D. Roosevelt, who died in 1945 after 12 years in office.
The president also tried to transfer his popularity among the faithful to Vice President Gore, who has had an arduous time rousing his party.
Mr. Clinton, who has said Mr. Gore's election is crucial to protecting his own legacy, offered this testament: "In the most challenging moments, when we faced the most difficult issues of war and peace, of whether to take on some powerful special interests, he was always there."
Linking Mr. Gore to the economic good times, Mr. Clinton said of his ambitious plan to cut the deficit in 1993: "It passed by a single vote in both houses. In a deadlocked Senate, Al Gore cast the deciding vote. Not a single Republican supported it. Their leaders said our plan would increase the deficit, kill jobs and give us a one-way ticket to recession."
He paused for effect: "Time has not been kind to their predictions."
Mr. Clinton's entrance to the hall steadily built. As the crowd roared in anticipation, a camera followed him as he strode briskly down a corridor toward the stage for his moment of triumph. When he said his first "thank you" to settle the adoring crowd, a chant broke out, "Thank you, Bill!"
And at times the speech seemed as much an argument for yet another campaign as a celebration of things past. Occasionally, the crowd broke out into cries of "let's go, Bill!" as if he were the nominee.
Even as Mr. Clinton was trying to hand off the party to Mr. Gore, the production tonight lacked the end-of-an-era wistfulness of Ronald Reagan's farewell in 1988.
That was in part because Mr. Clinton's wife, Hillary, was front and center, speaking in her new role as Senate candidate. Mrs. Clinton not only commended her husband and blessed the nomination of Mr. Gore but sought to bolster her own bid for the Senate from New York.
After calling on the public to "continue America's progress" by electing Mr. Gore and his running mate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Mrs. Clinton turned to her own race.
"For me, it will be up to the people of New York to decide whether I'll have the privilege of serving them in the United States Senate," she said. "But I will always be profoundly grateful to all of you and to the American people for the last eight years. Really, the most important thing that I can say tonight is thank you."
In contrast to the Republican convention two weeks ago, which was choreographed to second-by-second precision, the Democratic gathering -- typical for the party -- had the untamed feel of street theater. Mr. Clinton did not reach the rostrum until close to 11 p.m. E.D.T., nearly 25 minutes past schedule, and missed most of the prime-time TV audience. A top aide said the president did not finish tinkering with his speech until about 9:30 p.m.
During a year in which Mr. Clinton has surrendered the political stage to his vice president and to his wife -- only grudgingly, his friends and advisers say -- the event tonight was a prime-time reminder of how the president dominates his party as a political and oratorical force.
And to some delegates, it was a reminder that Mr. Gore faces a daunting challenge in trying to inspire voters as skillfully as Mr. Clinton -- widely regarded as the party's most adroit campaigner since John F. Kennedy, who was nominated at a convention in Los Angeles in 1960.
The outpouring for Mr. Clinton underscored a daunting problem for Mr. Gore: the more powerful that Mr. Clinton was in his speech, the less likely that the vice president could pull off a climactic acceptance speech Thursday night.
"There's a certain sadness to this evening," said Cheri Hamilton, a delegate from Kentucky who covered herself in Clinton-Gore buttons. "They have been a good team, Clinton and Gore. Gore will work well with Lieberman. But I'm really going to miss Bill."
Bob Grizzard, a Florida delegate who wore a Clinton '92 T-shirt over his dress shirt and tie, said, "I would vote for Clinton again if I could but, unfortunately, the Constitution says I can't."
Everywhere on the convention floor were signs reflecting the crowd's deep affection for the Clintons. A woman, bopping to the music, waved a sign that proclaimed, "Iowa Loves Clinton." Similar signs could be seen in the Kansas section, in Utah, Florida, Indiana, New Mexico and elsewhere. The New York contingent hoisted dozens of "Hillary" posters, waving them madly and passing a few to delegates in the Colorado section.
When short excerpts of past convention speeches by Democratic presidents were shown on a screen overhead, there was warm applause for Mr. Kennedy, and polite applause for Jimmy Carter. But the moment Mr. Clinton's face filled the screen, the hall exploded with cheers. It was impossible not to notice that the sound fell slightly but unmistakably when Mr. Clinton's clip was followed by one of Mr. Gore.
Another explanation for an apparent lack of excitement about Mr. Gore among some of the 4,339 delegates is that polls show he is trailing Mr. Bush.
Tonight, Mr. Clinton faced one of the most precarious political challenges of his career: to offer a stout endorsement of Mr. Gore that will spur Democrats -- and the American public -- to rally around the vice president. But he also had to take care to leave Mr. Gore some room to declare his independence.
He devoted far more attention to Mr. Gore than to Mrs. Clinton, whom he praised for her work with children and for being "a great first lady," who will "always be there for the families of New York and America."
For much of his address, Mr. Clinton reprieved what he considered the triumphs of his own administration, from cutting taxes to cracking down on crime to cleaning the environment to making the world more secure. He did not recall any of the failures of his tenure, notably his wife's campaign to overhaul the health care system.
Invoking the slogan of his acceptance speech four years ago, he declared: "My fellow Americans, tonight we can say with gratitude and humility: We built our bridge to the 21st century. We crossed that bridge together. And we're not going back."
The president drew one of the biggest ovations when he recalled Mr. Reagan's famous refrain from 1980. "My fellow Americans, are we better off today than we were eight years ago?" he asked. "You bet we are."
Asserting that the new ticket would build on his foundation, Mr. Clinton said: "Al Gore and Joe Lieberman will keep our prosperity going by paying down the debt, investing in education and health care and providing family tax cuts that we can afford. Now that stands in stark contrast to the position of our Republican friends." He offered what sounded like a point-by-point rebuttal of Mr. Bush's acceptance speech two weeks ago.
And Mr. Clinton's presence tonight could not help but remind viewers of the Clinton administration scandals that the Bush campaign is intent on keeping alive. For some Democrats, the president's departure on Tuesday could not come too soon.
As Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. of Illinois put it at a news conference today, "We've got to get Bill Clinton -- and I'm going to say this quite frankly and quite bluntly -- out of town as quickly as possible and get to these issues and not make our convention some referendum on what occurred in the impeachment process."
The evening was clearly an emotional crest for Mr. Clinton and his stalwart supporters. Advisers to Mr. Clinton said he was choking up as he rehearsed his lines earlier in the day.
Toward the end of the address, Mr. Clinton, who turns 54 on Saturday, harkened back to his roots in Arkansas. "Fifty-four years ago this week, I was born in a summer storm to a young widow in a small Southern town. America gave me the chance to live my dreams. I have tried to give you a better chance to live yours. Now, with hair grayer and wrinkles deeper, but with the same optimism and hope I brought to the work I love eight years ago, my heart is filled with gratitude."
Beyond the objective of pumping up Mr. Gore for four nights, the Democrats sought to portray the Republicans as staging a masquerade of moderation at their convention.
Speaker after speaker stirred up the Democratic faithful by upbraiding the opposition.
"The Republicans put on quite a spectacle in Philadelphia," said Terry McAuliffe, the chairman of the convention and the party's most proflific fund raiser. "They pretended they were tolerant. They pretended they were moderates. They pretended they cared about education, health care and the environment. Let's face it, they pretended they were Democrats."
Gov. Gray Davis of California welcomed the delegates, saying, "Here in the home of the film industry, we've seen the previews of the Republicans' movie, 'George and Dick's Excellent Adventure.' I don't think it's going to make it."
And Andrew Tobias, the Democratic Party's treasurer, said: "The Democratic leadership celebrates diversity, not for show -- for real. They have made my life and the lives of millions of other gay and lesbian Americans immeasurably better."
On this first day, there was not quite the harmony that so marked the Republican convention. Representative Loretta Sanchez of California rebuffed an offer to address the convention, saying she didn't want to appear as if she had been motivated by "personal gain" when -- under pressure from the Gore campaign -- she agreed to move a fund-raiser from the Playboy mansion.

HEADLINE: THE DEMOCRATS:;
Clinton's Address to Party: Extolling 8 Years of Change in America

 BODY:
Following is a transcript of President Clinton's speech to the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles yesterday, as recorded by The New York Times:
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Isn't it great to be here in California together? Forty years ago, the great city of Los Angeles launched John Kennedy and the New Frontier. Now, Los Angeles is launching the first president of the new century: Al Gore. 
 I am here tonight, above all, to say a heartfelt thank you. Thank you. Thank you for giving me the chance to serve. Thank you for being so good to Hillary and Chelsea. I am so proud of them. And didn't she give a good talk? I thought it was great. I thank you for supporting the new Democratic agenda that has taken our country to new heights of prosperity, peace and progress. As always, of course, the lion's share of the credit goes to the American people, who do the work, raise the kids and dream the dreams.
Now, at this moment of unprecedented good fortune, our people face a fundamental choice: Are we going to keep this progress and prosperity going?
Yes, we are!
But, my friends, we can't take our future for granted. We cannot take it for granted. So let's just remember how we got here.
Eight years ago, when our party met in New York, it was at a far different time for America. Our economy was in trouble, our society was divided, our political system was paralyzed. Ten million of our fellow citizens were out of work. Interest rates were high. The deficit was $290 billion and rising. After 12 years of Republican rule, the federal debt had quadrupled, imposing a crushing burden on our economy and on our children.
Welfare rolls, crime, teen pregnancy, income inequality -- all had been skyrocketing. And our government was part of the problem, not part of the solution.
I saw all this in a very personal way in 1992, out there in the real America with many of you. I remember a child telling me her father broke down at the dinner table because he'd lost his job. I remember an older couple crying in front of me because they had to choose between filling their shopping carts and filling their prescriptions. I remember a hard-working immigrant in a hotel kitchen who said his son was not really free, because he wasn't safe for him to play in the neighborhood park.
I ran for president to change the future for those people.
And I asked you to embrace new ideas rooted in enduring values: opportunity for all, responsibility from all, and a community of all Americans.
You gave me the chance to turn those ideas and values into action, after I made one of the very best decisions of my entire life: asking Al Gore to be my partner.
Now, first, we proposed a new economic strategy: get rid of the deficit to reduce interest rates, invest more in our people, sell more American products abroad.
We sent our plan to Congress. It passed by a single vote in both houses. In a deadlocked Senate, Al Gore cast the tie-breaking vote. Now, not a single Republican supported it. Here's what their leaders said. Their leaders said our plan would increase the deficit, kill jobs, and give us a one-way ticket to a recession. Time has not been kind to their predictions.
Now, remember, our Republican friends said then they would absolutely not be held responsible for our economic policies. I hope the American people take them at their word.
Now, today, today after seven and a half years of hard effort, we're in the midst of the longest economic expansion in history. More than 22 million new jobs, the lowest unemployment in 30 years, the lowest female unemployment in 40 years, the lowest Hispanic and African-American unemployment rate ever recorded, and the highest homeownership in history.
Now, along the way, in 1995, we turned back the largest cuts in history in Medicare, Medicaid, education, and the environment. And just two years later, we proved that we could find a way to balance the budget and protect our values. Today, we have gone from the largest deficits in history to the largest surpluses in history. And if, if but only if we stay on course, we can make America debt-free for the first time since Andy Jackson was president in 1835.
Now, for, for the first time in decades, wages are rising at all income levels. We have the lowest child poverty in 20 years, the lowest poverty rate for single mothers ever recorded. The average family's income has gone up more than $5,000 and for African-American families, even more. The number of families, the number of families who own stock in our country has grown by 40 percent.
You know, Harry Truman's old saying has never been more true: If you want to live like a Republican, you better vote for the Democrats.
But our progress is about far more than economics. America is also more hopeful, more secure and more free.
We're more hopeful because we're turning our schools around, with higher standards, more accountability, more investment. We have doubled funding for Head Start and provided after-school and mentoring to more than a million more young people. We're putting 100,000 well-trained teachers in the early grades to lower class size. Ninety-five percent of our schools are already connected to the Internet.
Reading, math and SAT scores are up. And more students than ever are going on to college, thanks to the biggest expansion of college aid since the G.I. Bill 50 years ago.
Now, don't let anybody tell you that all children can't learn or that our public schools can't make the grade. Yes, they can. Yes, they can.
Now, we're also more hopeful because we ended welfare as we knew it. Now those who can work, must work. On that, we and the Republicans agreed. But we Democrats also insisted on support for good parenting so that poor children don't go hungry or lose their health care, unmarried teens stay in school and people get the job training, child care and transportation they need. It has worked. Today, there are more than seven and a half million people who've moved from welfare to work, and the welfare rolls in our administration have been cut in half.
Now, we're more hopeful because of the way we cut taxes -- to help Americans meet the challenges of work and child rearing. This year alone, our HOPE scholarship and lifelong learning tax credits will help 10 million families pay for college.
Our earned income tax credit will help 15 million families work their way into the middle class. Twenty-five million families will get a $500 child tax credit.
Our empowerment zone tax credits are bringing new businesses and new jobs to our hardest pressed communities, from the inner cities to Appalachia to the Mississippi Delta to our Native American reservations. And the typical American family today is paying a lower share of its income in federal income taxes than at any time during the past thirty-five years.
We are more hopeful because of the Family and Medical Leave Act, a bill that the previous administration vetoed. They said it would cost jobs. It's the first bill I signed. And, we now have a test. Twenty-two million new jobs later, over 20 million Americans have been able to take a little time off to care for a newborn child or a sick relative. That's what it means, that's what it really means to be pro-family.
We are a more secure country, because we cut crime, with tougher enforcement, more than 100,000 new community police officers, a ban on assault weapons and the Brady law, which has kept guns out of the hands of half a million felons, fugitives and stalkers. Today, crime in America is at a 25-year low.
And we're more secure because of advances in health care. We've extended the life of the Medicare trust fund by 26 years, added coverage for cancer screening and cutting-edge clinical trials.
We're coming closer to cures for dreaded diseases. We made sure that people with disabilities could go to work without losing their health care and that people could switch jobs without losing their coverage. We dramatically improved diabetes care.
We provided health coverage under the Children's Health Insurance Program to two million previously uninsured children.
And for the first time in our history, more than 90 percent of our kids have been immunized against serious childhood diseases. You can be proud of that Democratic record.
We are, we're more secure because our environment is cleaner. We've set aside more land in the lower 48 states than any administration since Teddy Roosevelt, saving national treasures like Yellowstone, the great California redwoods, the Florida Everglades. Moreover, our air is cleaner, our water is cleaner, our food is safer and our economy is stronger. You can grow the economy and protect the environment at the same time.
Now, we're more free because we are closer today to the one America of our dreams, celebrating our diversity, affirming our common humanity, opposing all forms of bigotry, from church burnings to racial profiling to murderous hate crimes. We're fighting for the employment nondiscrimination legislation and for equal pay for women.
We have found ways to mend, not end, affirmative action. We've given America the most diverse administration in history. It really looks like America. You know, if I could just get my administration up here it would be just as good a picture as anything you saw a couple of weeks ago in Philadelphia, the real people running it.
And we created AmeriCorps, which already has given more than 150,000 of our young people a chance to earn some money for college by serving in our communities.
We are more secure and we're more free because of our leadership in the world for peace, freedom, and prosperity: helping to end a generation of conflict in Northern Ireland, stopping the brutal ethnic cleansing in Bosnia and Kosovo, and bringing the Middle East closer than ever to a comprehensive peace.
We have built stronger ties to Africa, Asia and our Latin American and Caribbean neighbors. We brought Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic into NATO. We're working with Russia to destroy nuclear weapons and materials. We're fighting head-on the new threats and injustices of the global age: terrorism, narco-trafficking, biological and chemical warfare, the trafficking in women and young girls and the deadly spread of AIDS.
And in the great tradition of President Jimmy Carter, who's here tonight, we are still the world's leading force for human rights around the world. Thank you, President Carter.
Now, the American military is the best trained, best equipped, most effective fighting force in the world. Our men and women have shown that time and again: in Bosnia, in Kosovo, in Haiti, in Iraq. I can tell you that their strength, their spirit, their courage and their commitment to freedom have never been greater. Any adversary who believes those who say otherwise is making a grave mistake.
Now, my fellow Americans, that's the record. Or as that very famous Los Angeles detective Sergeant Joe Friday used to say, "Just the facts, ma'am." Let's remember, I ask you, let's remember the standard our Republican friends used to have for whether a party should continue in office. My fellow Americans, are we better off today than we were eight years ago?
You bet we are!
Yes, we are.
Now -- yes, we are. But we're not just better off, we're also a better country. We are today more tolerant, more decent, more humane, and more united. Now, that's the purpose of prosperity.
Since 1992, America has grown not just economically, but as a community. Yes, jobs are up, but so are adoptions. Yes, the debt is down, but so is teen pregnancy. We are becoming both more diverse and more united.
My fellow Americans, tonight we can say with gratitude and humility: We built our bridge to the 21st century. We crossed that bridge together. And we're not going back!
Now, to those who say -- and I'm sure you heard this somewhere in the last few days -- to those who say the progress of these last eight years was just some sort of accident, that we just kind of coasted along, let me be clear: America's success was not a matter of chance, it was a matter of choice.
And today, America faces another choice. It's every bit as momentous as the one we faced eight years ago. For what a nation does with its good fortune is just as stern a test of its character, values and judgment as how it deals with adversity.
My fellow Americans, this is a big election, with great consequences for every American, because the differences -- the honest differences -- between our candidates and their visions are so profound. We can have a good old-fashioned election here. We should posit that our opponents are good, honorable, patriotic people and that we have honest differences. But the differences are there.
Consider this, just this: We in America would already have this year a real patients' bill of rights, a minimum wage increase, stronger equal pay laws for women and middle-class tax cuts for college tuition and long-term care if the Democratic Party were in the majority in Congress, with Dick Gephardt as speaker and Tom Daschle as majority leader. And come November, they will be.
Now, that has to be clear to people. And that's why every House and every Senate seat is important. But if you'll give me one moment of personal privilege, I'd like to say a word about Hillary.
When I first met her 30 years ago, she already had an abiding passion to help children. And she's pursued it ever since. Her very first job out of law school was with the Children's Defense Fund.
Every year I was governor she took lots of time away from her law practice to work for better schools, or better children's health or jobs for parents who lived in poor areas. Then when I became president, she became a full-time advocate for her lifetime cause. And what a job she has done. She championed the Family Leave law, children's health insurance, increased support for foster children and adoptions. She wrote a best-selling book about caring for our children and then she took care of them by giving all the profits to children's charities. For 30 years, 30 years from the first day I met her, she has always been there for all our kids.
She's been a great first lady. She's always been there for our family. And she'll always be there for the families of New York and America.
Now, of course we all know that the biggest choice that the American people have to make this year is in the presidential race. Now, you all know how I feel. But it's not my decision to make. That belongs to the American people. I just want to tell all of you here in this great arena and all the folks watching and listening at home a few things that I know about Al Gore.
We have worked closely together for eight years now. In the most challenging moments, when we faced the most difficult issues -- of war and peace, of whether to take on some powerful interest -- he was always there. And he always told me exactly what he thought was right.
Everybody knows he is thoughtful and hard-working. But I can tell you personally he is one strong leader.
In 1993, there was nobody around the table more willing to make the tough choices to balance the budget the right way and take the tough stands against balancing the budget on the backs of the poor and working people of America. I have seen this kind of positioning and this kind of strength time and time again.
Whether it was in how we reform welfare, or in protecting the environment, or in closing the digital divide, or bringing jobs to rural and urban America through the empowerment zone program, the greatest champion of ordinary Americans has always been Al Gore.
I'll tell you something else about him. More than anybody else I've known in public life, Al Gore understands the future and how sweeping changes and scientific breakthroughs will affect ordinary Americans' lives. And I think we need somebody in the White House at the dawn of the 21st century who really understands the future.
Finally, I want to say something more personal. Virtually every week for the last seven and half years, until he became occupied with more important matters, Al Gore and I had lunch. And we talked about the business between us and the business of America. But we'd also often talk about our families, what our kids were doing, how school was going, what was going on in their lives. I know him. He is a profoundly good man. He loves his children more than life. And he has a perfectly wonderful wife who has fought against homelessness and who has done something for me and all Americans in bringing the cause of mental health into the broad sunlight of our national public life. We owe Tipper Gore our thanks.
Al has picked a great partner in Joe Lieberman. There's the Connecticut crowd.
Hillary and I have known Joe for 30 years, since we were in Connecticut in law school. I supported him in his first race for public office in 1970, when I learned he had been a freedom rider, going into danger, to register black voters in the then-segregated South.
It should not be a surprise to anyone that Al Gore picked the leader of the new Democrats to be his vice president. Because Joe Lieberman has supported all our efforts to reform welfare, reduce crime, protect the environment, protect civil rights and a woman's right to choose and to keep this economy going. All of them. And he has shown time and time again that he will work with President Gore to keep putting people and progress over partisanship.
Now, it's up, frankly, to the presidential nominee and the vice presidential nominee to engage in this debate and to point out the differences. But there are two issues I care a lot about and I want to make brief comments on them. And I hope I've earned the right to make comments on them. One is the economy -- I know a little something about that -- and the other is our efforts to build one America.
First, on the economy, Al Gore and Joe Lieberman will keep our prosperity going by paying down the debt, investing in education and health care, moving more people from welfare to work and providing family tax cuts we can afford. Now, that stands in stark contrast to the position of our Republican friends. Here is their position. They say we have a big projected 10-year surplus and they want to spend every dime of it and then some on tax cuts right now. That would leave nothing for education or Medicare, prescription drugs, nothing to extend the life of Medicare and Social Security for the baby-boomers, nothing in case the projected surpluses don't come in.
Now, think about your own family's budget for a minute, or your own business budget. Would you sign a binding contract today to spend all your projected income for a decade, leaving nothing for your family's basic needs, nothing for emergencies, nothing for a cushion in case you didn't get the raise you thought you were going to get? Of course you wouldn't do that. And America shouldn't do it, either. We should stick with what works.
Now, let me say something to you that's even more important than the economy to me. When Al Gore picked Joe Lieberman, the first Jewish American to join a national ticket, to be his partner, and he joined with our presidential nominee who has, along with his great mother and late father, a lifetime commitment to civil rights and equal opportunity for all, even when it was not popular down home in the South -- when they did that, we had a ticket that embodies the Democratic commitment to one America. They believe in civil rights and equal opportunity for everybody. They believe in a woman's right to choose. And this may be the most important of all, they believe the folks that you're buying your soft drinks, soft drinks and popcorn from here at the Staples Center should have the exact same chance that they do to send their kids to college and give them a good life and a good future.
Now, my fellow Americans, I am very proud of our leaders.
And I want you to know that the opportunity I have had to serve as president at the dawn of a new era in human history has been an honor, a privilege and a joy. I have done everything I knew how to do to empower the American people, to unleash their amazing optimism and imagination and hard work, to turn our country around from where it was in 1992 and to get us moving forward together.
Now, what I want you to understand tonight is that the best is still out there. The best is yet to come if we make the right choices in this election year.
But the choices will make all the difference. In February the American people achieved the longest economic expansion in our history. When that happened I asked our folks at the White House when the previous longest economic expansion was.
You know when it was? It was from 1961 through 1969. Now, I want the young people especially to listen to this. I remember this well. I graduated from high school in 1964. Our country was still very sad by, because of President Kennedy's death, but full of hope under the leadership of President Johnson, and I assumed then, like most Americans, that our economy was absolutely on automatic, that nothing could derail it. I also believed then that our civil rights problems would all be solved in Congress and the courts. And in 1964 when we were enjoying the longest economic expansion in history, we never dreamed that Vietnam would so divide and wound America. So we took it for granted.
And then, before we knew it, there were riots in the streets, even here. The leaders that I adored as a young man -- Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy -- were killed. Lyndon Johnson, a president from my part of the country I admired so much for all he did for civil rights, for the elderly and the poor, said he would not run again because our nation was so divided. And then we had an election in 1968 that took America on a far different and more divisive course. And, you know, within months after that election, the last longest economic expansion in history was, itself, history.
Why am I telling you this tonight? Not to take you down, but to keep you looking up. I have waited, not as president, but as your fellow citizen, for over 30 years to see my country once again in the position to build the future of our dreams for our children.
We are a great and good people. And we have an even better chance this time than we did then, with no great internal crisis and no great external threat. Still, I have lived long enough to know that opportunities must be seized or they will be lost.
My friends, 54 years ago this week, I was born in a summer storm to a young widow in a small Southern town. America gave me the chance to live my dreams. And I have tried as hard as I knew how to give you a better chance to live yours. Now, my hair's a little grayer, my wrinkles are a little deeper, but with the same optimism and hope I brought to the work I loved so eight years ago, I want you to know my heart is filled with gratitude.
My fellow Americans, the future of our country is now in your hands. You must think hard, feel deeply, and choose wisely.
And remember, whatever you think about me, keep putting people first. Keep building those bridges. And don't stop thinking about tomorrow. I love you and good night.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place -- Shuffling the Deck at Pearson;
But Are the Moves Too Fast to Follow?

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT

 BODY:
The folks back in Texarkana, Tex., should be proud of Marjorie Scardino. True to her Lone Star State roots, Mrs. Scardino, the chief executive of Pearson P.L.C., thinks big.
Since January 1997, when she took charge of Pearson -- a British publisher whose holdings include Penguin Books, The Economist magazine, The Financial Times newspaper and a major educational publishing operation -- Mrs. Scardino has overhauled the formerly sleepy company, engineering numerous major acquisitions and asset sales as well as many smaller deals. 
 The result, Mrs. Scardino contends, is a media company poised for growth by extending its books, newspapers and magazines into online, interactive communications. But the dizzying pace of change has made it difficult for even some sophisticated financial analysts to gauge the impact of the makeover.
"Analyzing how the existing businesses are performing is very difficult, which makes it tough to evaluate management," said Michael Nathanson, a publishing industry analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein & Company.
So far, investors in Britain seem to love Mrs. Scardino's attempt to propel a stodgy company into the new economy. Since she took the reins, the stock, which trades on the London Stock Exchange, has nearly tripled the performance of Britain's main index, the Financial Times Stock Exchange 100.
"There is a Marjorie factor," one analyst said. "They think she can do magic."
And the company is so confident of investor support that Pearson has secured a listing on the New York Stock Exchange, where its shares will begin trading in September.
Just last month Mrs. Scardino announced Pearson's purchase of National Computer Systems, based in Minneapolis, for $2.5 billion in cash. The purchase is meant to let Pearson expand its electronic educational business to include testing services and the connection of schools to homes.
Pearson is raising the money for the deal through a rights offering that creates roughly 25 percent more shares -- a move that worried some investors because the shares were sold at below-market prices. Nonetheless, investors and analysts generally supported the deal. And despite some concerns that Pearson was making yet another high-priced acquisition, analysts generally found it a good strategic fit.
"We really think education will change, and technology has given people the way to change it," an enthusiastic Mrs. Scardino said in a telephone interview last week. "It gives us the way to integrate the assessment portion of education in our school programs."
Worthy as the deal may be, though, it goes on a Pearson plate already heaped with acquisitions still waiting to be digested -- including the educational book division of Simon & Schuster, which Pearson bought for $4.6 billion in 1998.
Mrs. Scardino has, meanwhile, been unflinching in selling high-profile, but peripheral, operations, like the group that owns Madame Tussaud's wax museum, Pearson's stake in various Lazard Freres investment arms, and its holdings in the BSkyB satellite broadcasting business. But at some point, analysts say, Pearson's chief will need to demonstrate her ability to manage the company she has recast in her image.
Michael Picker, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston, wrote last week in a report that recommended holding, but not buying, the stock that "management is increasingly important, as publishers attempt to shift from a preservation focus to a growth focus."
Evaluating management skills is particularly difficult at a company that is undergoing change at such lightning speed. Even a key measurement -- profits or losses from continuing operations -- tends to be a floating figure on such a fluid ledger.
Profits and losses generated by one-time transactions have accounted for an unusually large -- and varying -- chunk of operating profit before taxes. In 1998, for example, the company reported 250 million, or $376.2 million, in operating profits. That represented 37.4 percent of profits before taxes and interest. Last year, it posted 318 million in operating profits, which accounted for about 50 percent of the 627 million in profits before taxes and interest. The balance was asset sales that included 348 million from the sale of Pearson's stake in the BSkyB satellite broadcasting business.
This year, analysts' estimates vary, but a new Morgan Stanley report projects Pearson's profits from continuing operations at 357 million, or 62 percent of profits before restructuring charges and interest.
To reduce it all to the simplest numbers: net per-share earnings rose from 6 pence in 1997 to 74.1 pence in 1998 and fell back to 48.2 pence last year.
"A company whose financials change so dramatically with acquisitions and sales, as evidenced by the huge percentage of profits generated by transactions, makes it impossible with any certainty to see what is happening to the performance of the underlying operations," said Bruce Greenwald, a professor of finance and economics at Columbia University's business school. "That issue is crucial to the future because acquisition activity only makes sense if supported by strong operating abilities."
In any acquisition, a buyer has some flexibility about writing down costs in the year of the purchase. With publishing companies, for example, those costs may include a portion of the expenses of creating educational reading programs, paying writers' advances and carrying inventory. Depending on how the numbers are recorded, future profit projections can look better than they might have otherwise.
Pearson's publishing operations represented 52 percent of its $5.37 billion in 1999 sales. But while the company provided pro forma comparisons for sales between 1998 and 1999, to reflect the acquisitions, it did not provide pro forma numbers for 1998 operating profits.
Mr. Nathanson of Bernstein expressed his frustration over this issue in a recent report. "Pro forma historical comparisons are difficult to make, to say the least," he wrote.
Even some bottom-line estimates are particularly complex. For example, Pearson releases three different per-share earnings figures -- earnings per equity share, earnings after removing one-time charges but before Internet investments, and earnings per share after one-time charges and after Internet investments.
A Pearson spokesman, John Phallon, contends that such numbers illuminate, rather than obscure, its financial performance because they distinguish performance before and after acquisitions. Still, Mr. Nathanson and a second analyst who insisted on anonymity said that separating out Internet spending implied that Pearson wanted outsiders to view it is a mere extra. "The reality is that Internet spending is not an option," Mr. Nathanson said. "It is a necessity, given their businesses."
Mr. Phallon added that the company also provided "underlying sales growth, trading margins" and other measures to help investors. And he said that providing 1998 pro forma figures for the Simon & Schuster unit would have been difficult since its former owner, Viacom, treated costs in a different way than Pearson. Still, Mr. Nathanson said those comparisons would have been helpful.
Several other analysts said they too found the numbers exceedingly complex. But they said they were leery of being critical for fear that Pearson could make access more difficult. Mr. Phallon contends he has found no difficulty among analysts "in understanding how we present our financial results."
Some deals, experts acknowledged, have been extremely clever. Mr. Nathanson cited Pearson's television programming units, which were worth about $1.5 billion before Mrs. Scardino formed an alliance with Bertlesmann and CLT-UFA, the big European broadcaster, to create Audiofina. Pearson's 22 percent of Audiofina currently has a market value of $4.84 billion.
And yet, the premium prices paid for some recent acquisitions have put extra pressure on Pearson's management to make them pay off. Pearson paid $466 million, or about 1.6 times annual sales, for the small children's book publisher Dorling Kindersly -- a high multiple by traditional standards, according to industry executives. The price for National Computer Systems was 50 times annual profits, which analysts have also generally characterized as top dollar.
And while Pearson's expansions may bring many advantages, size alone is not magical. Even after combining Pearson's existing educational businesses with the Simon & Schuster unit, the company has had mixed results in persuading schools to use its books. Though Pearson has done well in California, for example, its performance in Texas has been mediocre.
Peter Jovanovich, president of Pearson Publishing, said he was pleased that educational sales were up 15 percent, but added, "I wish we had done better in Texas."
And not all publishing experts are impressed by Pearson's heavy investment in the education market. "Why couldn't Pearson have done a joint venture with N.C.S.," one industry expert said of the National Computer deal. "Why did they need to buy it?"
Mr. Jovanovich said that National Computing's software programs for helping parents and teachers assess students' classroom performance could be complementary to Pearson's textbook business and online testing operations.
And while Pearson says that it can find $50 million in cost savings by combining with National Computer, gaining additional revenues could be a far trickier route to increased profitability. To one expert in the educational technology field, the issue will be getting two different cultures to work together.
"Creating educational content is different from building and testing administrative software for the schools," this person said, speaking on condition of anonymity to avoid riling Pearson in a field in which the company holds increasing power. "The question is whether they can integrate the educational experience and combine it with the assessment business."
Pearson itself had initially considered only an alliance with National Computer and had even discussed that possibility with the company. But when National Computer's chairman, Russ Gullotti, said he was going to retire, he approached Mr. Jovanovich about assuming his position. Mrs. Scardino -- always on the lookout for a deal -- chose to buy the company, perhaps, in part, because she was concerned about losing Mr. Jovanovich.
Now, while Mr. Jovanovich and other Pearson managers toil to incorporate this latest acquisition, investors and analysts will have their work cut out for them, too -- trying to get a fix on Mrs. Scardino's ever-changing company.

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Aug. 15 about business deals by Pearson P.L.C. of Britain misstated the title of an executive and the unit he runs. Peter Jovanovich is chief executive of Pearson Education, not president of Pearson Publishing. The article also misspelled the name of a Pearson spokesman. He is John Fallon, not Phallon.
The article also referred imprecisely to the reporting of Pearson's financial results. The company's financial statements include one-time gains and losses in profit before taxes and interest, not in operating profit.

HEADLINE: Australians Pushing Away From the Table

BYLINE: By BECKY GAYLORD 

DATELINE: SYDNEY, Australia

 BODY:
Chalk up another victim of America's eat-on-the-run workplace culture.
First it was the French. Traditionalists watched in horror as white-collar drones in the homeland of haute cuisine, caught up in the pressures of the global economy, began abandoning the wine-soaked three-hour lunch in the 1980's. 
 But who would have thought Australians -- that independent-minded, fun-loving lot Down Under -- would also succumb to the capitalist credo that productivity and profit-making constitute a higher calling than a leisurely midday meal?
Alas, the evidence of the Australian office worker's apostasy is everywhere. Start with the upscale rotating Summit restaurant, situated atop a skyscraper in the heart of the business district, where lunchtime business bustled a decade ago. "They used to fill the buffet from 1 to 3," said Jenny-Lee Stefas, who took over last year as sales and marketing manager.
How times have changed. By 1999, even after a refurbishment that included funky red carpet, sleek white chairs and a minimalist "Space Odyssey" theme, business had dropped off so much that on some days only three or four customers showed up, Ms. Stefas says. That left room for 347 more.
To lure more business people, the restaurant took aim at their weak spot and advertised a rich repast in one hour flat. Business has tripled, to an average 75 diners. They are able to sit down at noon and order, say, warm chili prawns with mango and cucumber relish followed by crisp-skin Tasmanian salmon with green-pea puree, tomato provencale and olive oil, all of it washed down with a good wine, and be out the door by 1. And if the Summit fails to deliver on the one-hour guarantee, customers win a one-night stay at a country resort.
Other top-flight restaurants have begun speeding things up. Late last year, the highly regarded MG Garage restaurant put together a quick-lunch special for 25 Australian dollars, or $15. "You can come here with a main course and a glass of wine already chosen to go with it, and that alone cuts the time of having to look at the menu and decide," said Janni Kyritsis, MG Garage's head chef.
For years, American business people have eschewed wine at weekday lunches. In Australia, the trend is newer, but growing. "If you go out for a boozy lunch, you write your whole afternoon off," said Leigh Anderson, a manager at Morgan & Banks, an executive recruitment firm here. "People can't afford to do that."
Not that Mr. Anderson is a stranger to the long lunch. He said that at the company he worked for six years ago in London it "was almost a condition of your employment to take people out for lunch."
And they could be fairly liquid affairs, he confessed. Now, at Morgan & Banks, he said, "we tend to discourage that."
Harland Koops, a partner at the law firm of Henry Davis York, has also weaned himself of long lunches, though he says he was never a regular player on the lunch circuit. "Calvinistic instincts seem to be reasserting themselves," Mr. Koops said.
Clients, he added, "really have their heads down making money, and they're not playing as much as they used to."
Ah, the good old days, Australian business people claimed a leisurely lunch of several courses and accompanying wines, followed by dessert and coffee, as a national privilege.
Until late last year, even the bond market closed for a respectable hour and a half -- one of only a handful in the world to cease business in the middle of the day. Throughout the 1980's and into the early 90's, that shutdown created the occasional phenomenon known as the claret run. "That's when a market would go on a seemingly inexplicable rally," one money market dealer explained. "And it was based on the fact that a few people would come back from lunch all liquored up and decide they liked the market and start buying it."
Sometimes, they would not come back at all, and the business lunch would slide into dinner. Such epicureans were known as F.T.R.'s, for "failed to return."
So what happened? What drove Aussies toward midday temperance?
Time-poor, cholesterol-rich executives cite not just the global economy and the competitive pressures it has unleashed, but also fitness concerns. An increasing number are heading out for a lunch-hour jog or a session with a personal trainer. Or else they are eating at their desks so they can leave early for some surfing or golf.
There was also the government's elimination of tax-deductible lunches in two stages -- the first in the 1980's, the second in the mid-1990's. Tony Bilson, director of the chic Ampersand Restaurant, called that change a "body blow." It was followed by a new 10 percent tax on restaurant meals, that began on July 1, presaging even harder times to come. The trade at midday is so thin on some days that Mr. Bilson occasionally mulls shutting Ampersand for lunch.
The same gastronomic drama has been playing itself in other parts of the world, notably France, where long, liquid lunches were for years a sacred ritual. No more. Listen to Capucine Favet, 26, a designer of street events for W.M., an outdoor-event company in Paris. "Everyone goes out to the boulangerie, and comes back with bread, or cheese or something, and eats together as a group," Ms. Favet says.
The trend toward faster midday meals has been long in the making in France, but got a fresh nudge in January with a law that bans salaried employees from putting in more than 35 hours a week. In response, many companies have stopped counting lunch hours in the figure, said Patrick Lenain, an economist with the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris. "Now people who take two or three hours are executives, and it's business lunches with clients," Mr. Lenain said.
In Australia, though, all the changes put together are not likely to deter die-hard diners. "I work with a fellow who's known as Sir Lunch a Lot," Mr. Koops said. "They're still out there, mate. They're just lunching on."
Indeed, at 3:30 on a recent afternoon, Mr. Koops's colleague could not be reached at his office. He was, his secretary said, still at lunch.

HEADLINE: CRITICS NOTEBOOK;
The Case of the Elusive XO

BYLINE: By William Grimes 

 BODY:
DINING out has its pleasure and its mysteries, and XO sauce is both.
Those two cryptic letters flitted around for years in the storage area of my brain taken up by old B-movie actors whose names elude me, books I intend to read but have never gotten around to and unsolved historical puzzles like the origin of bouillabaisse, which a faithful correspondent demands that I credit to the Greeks. (He's Greek.) 
 A few weeks ago, XO moved directly to my frontal lobe. It is one of the star attractions at a Hong Kong-style restaurant in Manhattan, Ping's Seafood, and on repeated visits I developed an infatuation with it. It came with a simple dish of steamed scallops, showing up as a small, viscous puddle on each shell. The flavor was intriguing: salty and sweet, hot and sour.
I put my nose right down to table level and studied the situation. I could see tiny bits of dried shrimp, garlic, chilies and scallop. There were very thin chopped-up noodles, too, and nearly microscopic chips and flecks of unknown ingredients. If this was XO, I had to get to the bottom of it.
A chance remark by a fellow diner heightened my curiosity. He mentioned in passing that when he grew up in Hong Kong, in the 1960's, XO sauce did not exist. All cuisines change, of course, but Chinese cuisine seems almost immutable, an endless list of classic dishes codified eons ago. The very idea of a new sauce on the block made the search for XO that much more compelling. Unfortunately, no one seemed to know very much about it. Even knowledgeable Sinophiles drew a blank when XO came up in the conversation. Books on Chinese cuisine failed to mention it. I began calling and e-mailing experts around the world. I queried the very diligent Hong Kong Tourist Association. I did not turn up a lot. XO, I was told, was born in Hong Kong fairly recently and usually involved dried scallops. That was about it.
Finally, I reached Ken Hom, the cookbook author, at his home in southwestern France. XO was music to his ears. It turned out that he, too, had embarked on the same quest, about 20 years ago when he was giving cooking classes in Hong Kong and kept encountering a strange new sauce with an odd name. XO.
Accompanied by Willie Mark, an expert on Hong Kong cuisine, Mr. Hom began eating his way around Hong Kong and quizzing chefs and owners. What was this XO, exactly? Where did it come from? Who invented it? The two detectives never found the smoking wok -- the world of food seldom yields clear-cut answers -- but they narrowed their circle of inquiry tightly enough to make an informed guess.
"There is a group of very expensive restaurants called Sun Tung Lok, owned by the Yuen family, that specializes in shark's fin dishes," Mr. Hom said. "I think they were the first." Then Fook Lam Moon, a celebrated seafood restaurant in Kowloon, began making it, too. "They actually started bottling and selling their sauce," Mr. Hom said, "which is very rare."
An alternative theory comes from Tian-Sak Wong, who edited the Hong Kong magazine Food World at the time. Mr. Wong credits two innovative seafood restaurants for the sauce, East Ocean and Tsui Hang Village.
The motivation for developing the sauce seems beyond dispute. "I think it's one of those things where restaurants thought, 'How can we squeeze more money out of the customers?' " Mr. Hom said. There was a lot of money to be squeezed in Hong Kong at the time. Why not take a basic chili sauce, add some expensive ingredients like dried scallops, give it a marketable name and charge a premium for it? At the time, wealthy diners were ordering the expensive, aged XO-grade Cognac at dinner and drinking it by the bottle through the meal. "XO" had just the right splurgy connotations of luxury, like Rolex or Rolls-Royce.
In Hong Kong, trends spread quickly. Although connoisseurs derided XO as inauthentic, and impractical to boot, it caught on as a status marker. Soon, restaurants all over town were making XO, often throwing in a little twist to establish their own brand, so to speak. The Regent Hotel, for example, added lemon grass to the basic recipe of dried scallops, dried shrimp, Yunan ham, shrimp roe, garlic and chili peppers. Even critics had to concede that the sauce was getting better. Diners began throwing XO on everything. A well-known sauce company, Lee Kum Kee, bottled its own version for the retail market.
In Vancouver, which probably has more Hong Kong-style restaurants per capita than any city in North America, XO is more or less standard at Chinese restaurants. Most of them charge a supplement of $2 to $5 for the sauce, and at some of the better restaurants it is bottled and sold for use during major holidays, like Chinese New Year. "Quite a lot of restaurants serve it," said Alan Yung, the manager of Sun Sui Wah Seafood, one of Vancouver's highest-rated Chinese restaurants, "although the quality depends on the what grade of dried scallop you use." His version uses dried garlic, dried chilies and uncured Virginia ham.
At Hon's Wun Tun House, a noodle restaurant, XO is sold on the side, like a condiment. It also appears in beef tenderloin with wide Shanghai noodles.
"It's terrific with any simple stir-fried seafood, like scallops or prawns with snow peas," said Stephen Wong, a Vancouver food writer, who grew up in Hong Kong. "It's also great with har-gow, the shrimp dumplings that come with dim sum."
I have never been to Vancouver, so I can only guess at the XO there. I did manage to find, at a shop across from the Manhattan Bridge market, a four-ounce bottle of Lee Kum Kee's XO, which is regarded as the best of the commercial versions. "Very good," the man behind the counter told me as he took my $6.75. "Very good, very hot."
It was neither. The sauce tasted excessively fishy, and the heat was nowhere to be found. It made me appreciate once again the Ping's version, a baroque creation whose seemingly endless list of ingredients includes fresh scallops, dried scallops, dried shrimp, shrimp roe, salted fish, dried ham, fresh green chilies, garlic, shallots, bacon, noodles and minced chicken. It takes the XO formula, already a newfangled, gaudy creation thrust upon the world by an overheated, fast-money economy, and works so many changes on it that surely a new name is required for this gilded lily. May I suggest Trump sauce?

HEADLINE: Industrial Output Advanced 0.4% in July

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 15

 BODY:
Industrial output rose in July, as production of computers and productivity-enhancing business equipment offset declines for automobiles, appliances and electricity, Federal Reserve data showed today.
Overall industrial production increased 0.4 percent last month, as expected, after gaining 0.2 percent in June. The details suggest that higher borrowing costs imposed by the Fed are slowing the market for expensive consumer goods without stalling efforts by companies to become more efficient. 
 "The Fed is probably seeing what it wants to see happen: a modest slowdown on the consumer side, but growth on the business investment side, which will improve productivity and keep inflation under control," said Clare Zempel, chief investment strategist for Robert W. Baird & Company in Milwaukee.
The Federal Open Market Committee meets next week to decide whether six increases in the overnight bank lending rate since June 1999 have been enough to cool the economy and keep inflation in check. At 6.5 percent, the rate that banks charge each other for overnight loans is at a nine-year high. The rate helps determine what banks charge their customers.
The plant-use rate, which measures how much of capacity factories put to work, rose to 82.3 percent from 82.2 percent in June. Analysts had expected a rate of 82.1 percent.
Production of consumer goods fell 0.5 percent after showing no change in June and falling 0.1 percent in May. Output of autos and related products fell 6.6 percent.

High Court Urged to Hear Microsoft Appeal Quickly

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
Declaring that the outcome of the Microsoft antitrust case could affect nearly every person who uses a computer, the Justice Department urged the Supreme Court yesterday to hear the company's appeal quickly so "that justice is not denied through delay."
The Supreme Court can hear direct appeals in civil antitrust cases brought by the federal government if it thinks the expedited review is in the national interest. 
 In its filing yesterday, the Justice Department argued forcefully that the Microsoft lawsuit is surely such a case. "A lengthy appeals process," the government stated, "could irreparably harm competition in a vital and rapidly evolving sector of the national economy."
Last month, Microsoft asked the court to let its appeal go first to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which had ruled for the company in a related case. Microsoft said the appeals court was the proper place for an initial review because the company's appeal raised many technical issues and argued that the trial judge made a series of procedural errors.
Microsoft will file a legal brief with the Supreme Court on Tuesday, seeking to undermine the arguments the government made yesterday.
With its filing, the Justice Department essentially tried to make it more difficult for the Supreme Court to decline a direct review. It characterized Microsoft's arguments as all but an insult to the court's competence. Microsoft, the government stated, "overstates the complexity of this case" and "underestimates this court's capabilities."
The government also suggested that if the court declined, it would leave the antitrust Expediting Act of 1903, which was amended in 1974, as a dead letter.
From 1903 until 1974, all appeals of civil antitrust cases brought by the government went directly to the Supreme Court, but the 1974 amendment gave the court more discretion in which appeals it heard directly. The standard, under the 1974 amendment, is that the case should be of "general public importance in the administration of justice."
In pointed language, the government told the court: "The stakes in this case for the national economy are immense. If this case does not qualify for direct review under the Expediting Act, it is difficult to imagine what future case would."
Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who heard the lawsuit in Federal District Court, ruled this year that Microsoft was a monopoly that had repeatedly violated the nation's antitrust laws. And he ordered that the company be split in two, an order he later shelved pending appeals. Microsoft is appealing both Judge Jackson's ruling and his breakup order.
The votes of four of the Supreme Court's nine justices would be needed for the court to hear an expedited appeal. If the case went directly to the Supreme Court, it could be resolved in a year. If it went first to the appeals court, the resolution could take up to two years.
The Supreme Court's decision on whether to hear the appeal directly could well be crucial to the outcome and the impact of the Microsoft case, legal experts say.
If the court proceeded with a direct appeal, they say, it would be a favorable sign for the government. The government would avoid a federal appeals court where Microsoft has done well in the past. And a move for expedited treatment would suggest that the court wanted to resolve a pressing problem quickly.
"If the Supreme Court's instinct is that Microsoft is a monopoly whose activities are costly to society, it will be more likely to take the case directly," said Herbert Hovenkamp, a professor at the University of Iowa law school. "But if not, then the cost of lingering is not so high, and then it will be more likely to let the appeals court review the case first."
The effect of any sanctions against Microsoft, assuming it lost the case on appeal, would probably be dulled by an additional year of delay. "For that reason, this is a decisive moment in the litigation," said William Kovacic, a professor at the George Washington University law school.
In its filing, the government addressed that issue, noting, "Delay will postpone, and likely complicate substantially, the restoration of competition in the affected high-technology industries, which evolve at an extraordinary pace."

Stocks Head Mostly Lower on Weakness in Retail Shares

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Stocks declined yesterday on weakness in retail shares after Home Depot reported earnings that fell short of the most optimistic expectations.
That dragged down the Dow Jones industrial average and snapped a three-day winning streak. 
 "You've got weakness in some retailers after Home Depot reported its results," said Chuck Carlson, co-manager of the Strong Dow 30 Value Fund. Mr. Carlson said the Dow was poised for a decline after gaining in 10 of the last 11 sessions and climbing 6.3 percent in that time.
The Dow dropped 109.14, or 0.98 percent, to 11,067.00. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 3.00, or 0.2 percent, to 1,488.56, with retail and financial shares the biggest losers. Four stocks fell for every three that rose on the New York Stock Exchange.
The Nasdaq composite index was up 1.97, to 3,851.66, as gains in semiconductor stocks including Intel and Rambus offset a decline in Network Appliance.
Chip stocks are benefiting from investor optimism that the Federal Reserve has finished raising interest rates, said John Forelli, portfolio manager at Independence Investment Associates in Boston. The last significant economic report before Fed policy makers meet next week is the Consumer Price Index, which will be released today. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News expected the report to show that retail inflation rose 0.1 percent in July.
Retail shares fell after several companies reported earnings at or near estimates. Home Depot dropped 51 5/16, to 53 3/4. Home Depot, the nation's largest home-improvement chain, reported fiscal second-quarter profit that met analysts' estimates while missing the most optimistic forecasts. The stock had jumped 7 percent in the last two sessions.
"They just did what was expected of them," Mr. Carlson said. "That may sound weird, but investors want to see these types of companies do better than expectations."
Target, the third-biggest discount retailer, fell 3, to 26 15/16. It reported second-quarter profit that matched analysts' estimates.
Wal-Mart Stores, the world's largest retailer, fell 3/4, to 51 3/4. It reported its results last week and warned of lower-than-expected earnings growth in the third quarter.
Brokerage stocks also fell, including Morgan Stanley, down 2 9/16, to 101 1/2; Goldman Sachs, down 2 5/8, to 118 3/16; and Lehman Brothers, down 6 5/8, to 130 3/4.
Network Appliance slid 51 3/16, to 841 5/16. The company reported profit that matched expectations, though new-order growth was not as strong as some analysts had expected. The shares have risen 80 percent in the last four months.
Intel rose 1 5/16, to 67 7/8, Rambus jumped 31 3/16, to 80 3/4. Texas Instruments advanced 2, to 65 3/4, extending Monday's 11 percent gain. Micron Technology rose for a third day, gaining 6, to 86 1/2.
Semiconductor stocks "should be able to enjoy a strong rally here through the end of the year," said Mark Edelstone, a Morgan Stanley Dean Witter analyst.
Ivax dropped 13, to 29 5/8, after the company said United States approval of its generic version of the Bristol-Myers Squibb cancer drug Taxol might be delayed by a new patent related to the drug, held by an undisclosed third party. Ivax's drug was expected to be approved no later than this month. Bristol-Myers rose 1 7/8, to 52 1/2.
Red Hat Inc. gained 2 3/16, to 24, leading a rally among companies that develop and distribute software based on the Linux operating system. International Business Machines, the world's biggest computer maker, said it would sell computers bundled with Red Hat software. VA Linux Inc., a maker of Linux software, climbed fell 3 1/16, to 381 5/16, and Corel, which distributes Linux software with its own suite of software, advanced 1/16, to 3 21/32.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	Treasury Prices Drop
 
Treasuries fell as the price of oil climbed to a 10-year high.
The 10-year note fell 3/16, to 99 21/32. Its yield rose 3 basis points, to 5.80 percent from 5.77 percent. The 30-year bond fell 3 1/4, to 107 3/4 while its yield rose 2 basis points, to 5.71 percent from 5.69 percent.
The 30-year bond has returned 14.6 percent this year, including reinvested interest, while the 10-year note has gained 8 percent.
The Treasury is expected to announce today it will repurchase $1.5 billion in long-term debt this week.

Still a Baby Boom

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN 

 BODY:
America's economic miracle -- which Bill Clinton claimed as vindication in his Monday speech, but George W. Bush insists was an act of God -- didn't begin when Mr. Clinton took office in 1993. And no, it didn't begin with Ronald Reagan either. In fact, it didn't really start until 1996 or so. In other words, this boom is still in its infancy; and like all infants, it remains vulnerable. Mr. Clinton's greatest achievement is that during his second term he avoided the fiscal irresponsibility that might have strangled our "new economy" at birth -- irresponsibility that his opponent in the 1996 election would have practiced. Will his successor emulate his example?
Of course, Mr. Clinton prefers to think that everything good that happened these past eight years was his own doing. You can see why: Republicans confidently predicted that his 1993 tax increase would produce disaster -- a recession, an even worse budget deficit. So Mr. Clinton has an understandable urge to crow over the fact that even in his first term things turned out pretty well. 
 But we're talking analysis here, not poetic justice; and the truth is that growth from 1992 to 1996 -- like growth from 1982 to 1989 -- was just an ordinary business cycle recovery, with no sign of an upturn in the economy's sluggish long-term trend. And business cycles have very little to do with the administration that happens to be in office; they are determined mainly by the actions of the Federal Reserve, not the president. Jimmy Carter and George Bush got blamed for the recessions that happened on their watches, Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton got credit for the recoveries that happened on theirs; but neither the credit nor the blame was deserved.
It was only in 1996 -- even as the right was comparing Mr. Clinton's recovery unfavorably with Mr. Reagan's -- that things really began to change. Productivity, which had grown at a snail's pace for two decades, began to accelerate -- and accelerate, and accelerate, with recent numbers so high they take one's breath away. Unemployment began falling to levels not seen since the inflationary years of the late 1960's -- but this time without inflation. And from these fundamentals many other good things flowed, from falling poverty and plunging crime rates to a record budget surplus.
Did the Clinton-Gore administration create this miracle? Of course not. The best guess is that a long process of technological innovation finally reached critical mass, creating new opportunities that American business was uniquely ready to exploit. But the right question isn't whether the policies of this administration gave birth to the new economy; it is whether different leadership would have killed it. Not to put too fine a point on it: What would have happened if Bob Dole had won?
I've been going back over Mr. Dole's economic program -- which, remember, was centered on huge tax cuts -- and trying to calculate what today's economy would look like if those tax cuts had been enacted. One clear conclusion is that even if the economy had grown as fast as it actually did, the federal budget -- certainly the non-Social-Security budget, and probably the whole shebang -- would still be in deficit. And it seems to me that our morale, not to mention business confidence, would be a lot lower if that budget were still out of control.
Anyway, the economy surely wouldn't have grown as fast as it did. Our soaring productivity didn't come out of thin air; an important, perhaps crucial ingredient was an amazing surge in business investment, especially in information technology. And this surge didn't have to happen. In a full-employment economy like that of America in the late 1990's, budget deficits mean that the government is borrowing money that would otherwise have been invested. This drives up interest rates, depresses asset prices and crimps business plans. Had Mr. Dole's tax cuts been enacted, the resulting deficits would surely have crowded out a lot of investment -- and quite possibly have crowded out the productivity boom.
Not long ago America faced a choice between sober, sensible fiscal discipline and huge, irresponsible tax cuts. We chose discipline, and were rewarded with growth beyond our wildest dreams. So why would anyone today propose exactly the kind of irresponsibility we were lucky to avoid four years ago?

Earnings Rise At Brazilian Plane Maker

BYLINE: By JENNIFER L. RICH 

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil, Aug. 15

 BODY:
Benefiting from vibrant demand for regional jets, Empresa Brasileira de Aeronautica S.A. reported a 35 percent gain in second-quarter earnings today on a 54 percent surge in sales.
The company, known as Embraer, is Brazil's largest manufacturing exporter and an emblem of Brazilian corporate success. In the recent quarter, it earned 112.9 million reais, or $62.6 million at current exchange rates, compared with 83.6 million reais in the period a year earlier. Quarterly sales rose to 1.2 billion reais, or $665.4 million. 
 The results reflected the demand for Embraer's short-haul jets, the fastest-growing segment of the commercial aviation market. The planes seat 30 to 110 people, with a range of about 1,500 miles, and are more profitable to operate on many routes than larger aircraft.
In the first half of the year, Embraer delivered 72 planes in the 30- to 50-seat ERJ-135/145 family to airlines around the world, up from 38 in the first half of 1999. In an effort to meet increasing demand, Embraer has accelerated its production to 14 aircraft a month and plans to speed that up further, to 16 planes a month by year-end.
Embraer valued its current backlog of undelivered planes at nearly $21 billion, of which $8.6 billion is in firm orders and $12.2 billion represents options on future purchases.
The company's president, Mauricio Botelho, has said that it plans to invest about $1.4 billion between 2000 and 2004, with $1.1 billion going into the development of new models and $300 million into construction of a new plant and research center. Embraer recently introduced the 44-seat ERJ-140, and is developing a family of jets in the 70-to-110-seat category.
For the first half of 2000, Embraer's earnings more than doubled, to 210.4 million reais, or $116.66 million, on a 62 percent increase in sales, to 2.2 billion reais, or $1.22 billion.
The strong financial results helped divert attention from a recent decision against Brazil at the World Trade Organization in a case involving an Embraer rival, Bombardier of Canada. The W.T.O., which arbitrates disputes between member countries, is expected to rule in the next couple of weeks on the value of sanctions that the Canadian government can levy on Brazilian imports.
In New York trading today, Embraer's American depository receipts fell 81.25 cents, to close at $23.6875. They began trading on July 21 at $18.50.

HEADLINE: Chancellor Blames Albany For Shortage of Teachers

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

 BODY:
Further straining his relationship with State Education Commissioner Richard P. Mills, Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy filed court papers yesterday that forcefully blamed Mr. Mills for the shortage of certified teachers in the city's 99 lowest-performing schools.
Specifically, Mr. Levy's lawyers charged, Mr. Mills has not made good on promises to provide financial incentives for certified teachers who agree to work in hard-to-staff schools; to improve programs at teaching colleges and attract strong candidates into those programs; and to finance a "master teacher" program, which would help outstanding teachers get advanced degrees and counsel less experienced teachers. 
 Mr. Levy was responding to a lawsuit that Mr. Mills filed on Aug. 1 to block the city from placing uncertified teachers in the 99 schools, designated as failing by the state. Mr. Mills went to court because the city had violated a new state policy that requires that only certified teachers be hired for those schools after September 1999.
In his lawsuit, Mr. Mills is demanding that the city not only replace nearly 600 unlicensed teachers assigned to the 99 schools last year, but also fill any additional vacancies with certified teachers. Mr. Levy has tried to comply by introducing several recruitment initiatives, including an alternative route toward obtaining certification and an increase in the starting salaries that private and parochial school teachers can earn if they transfer into the failing schools.
With Mr. Mills judging those actions inadequate, lawyers for Mr. Levy filed papers yesterday in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn that denounced the commissioner's demand as "arbitrary and capricious," not to mention "unreasonable and irrational." Since the State Board of Regents created the ban on uncertified teachers in failing schools, they said, it is the state's responsibility to find enough certified teachers to replace them.
"The Regents policy is a call to action for the state and the commissioner to drastically increase the pool of qualified teachers in New York State," Daniel McCray, a lawyer for the city who is representing Mr. Levy, wrote in the court papers. "However, the commissioner and the state have not come close to fulfilling their obligations."
In addition to failing to provide a financial incentive for certified teachers who agree to work in hard-to-staff schools and taking other promised steps, Mr. McCray wrote, the state had failed to fulfill its pledge to "initiate a campaign to encourage students to choose teaching as a profession."
Alan Ray, a spokesman for Mr. Mills, declined to comment on Mr. Levy's response to the lawsuit. He said the state would formally respond on Tuesday, in a hearing before Justice Joseph F. Bruno.
But in recent weeks, Mr. Mills and his aides have repeatedly said that the state has not only poured money into teacher recruitment, but also removed barriers that had hindered New York City's recruitment efforts. For example, the Board of Regents voted last month to allow alternative certification programs. And in March, the board voted to allow credentialed teachers from most other states to begin teaching here immediately rather than waiting to pass New York's certification exams.
Mr. Mills has maintained that the disproportionate number of uncertified teachers working in New York City's failing schools is the biggest obstacle to their improvement. But Mr. Levy, who faces the task of bringing the city's 1,100 public schools in line with the tough new standards he championed as a state regent, also has to face an array of local constituencies -- especially the powerful teachers' union, which has insisted that it will not allow Mr. Levy to force veteran certified teachers to transfer into failing schools against their will.
But pressure from the union is apparently not the only factor in Mr. Levy's refusal to take drastic measures. The court papers suggest that he is philosophically opposed to the idea of forcing teachers to work in troubled schools, especially now that the system is struggling to attract new teachers and retain older ones who are nearing retirement age.
Mr. Levy's lawyers also suggested in the court papers that uncertified teachers are not necessarily incompetent. They said that in recent years, the city has invested $50 million in on-the-job training for uncertified teachers in the 99 failing schools. The training has emphasized teaching practices "tailored for at-risk children," the court papers say.
"Many newly certified teachers fresh out of school, or veteran teachers who have worked only in high-performing schools, would not be familiar with these teaching methodologies," Mr. McCray wrote.
Student test scores have sharply improved in some of the schools, even though they have large numbers of uncertified teachers, Mr. McCray wrote. In particular, he pointed to P.S. 212 in the Bronx, where the percentage of students who scored in the lowest category decreased to 19.1 last year, from 53.2 percent in 1998. Yet nearly 40 percent of the teachers at that school are uncertified, according to the court papers.
The court papers suggested that Mr. Mills was being unrealistic in rigidly enforcing the new policy in light of the current teacher shortage. The ban on uncertified teachers in failing schools even extends to those in the Teach for America program, many of whom graduated from "the finest universities," the court papers say. Teach for America places recent college graduates in urban schools.
In a separate affidavit, Mr. Levy listed 13 recruiting strategies that the school board had used in recent months in an attempt to comply with the policy, and suggested there was nothing more that he could do.

HEADLINE: Navistar Cuts 1,100 Jobs, Citing Truck Order Drop

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Aug. 15

 BODY:
Responding to a slowdown in heavy-truck orders in North America, the Navistar International Corporation said today that it would lay off 1,100 employees, or about 15 percent of its white-collar work force.
The company, one of the world's largest makers of heavy trucks, buses and diesel engines, said that after several years of spectacular growth, orders for big trucks in North America had been falling steadily, largely because of higher interest rates, soaring fuel prices and a glut of used trucks. 
 The announcement by Navistar, which is based in Chicago, comes just a day after Freightliner, a unit of DaimlerChrysler A.G. and the world's biggest maker of heavy trucks, said that it would cut 3,475 jobs, or about 19 percent of its work force.
Earlier this month, Paccar, the world's No. 2 truck maker, based in Bellevue, Wash., said that it would lay off 430 workers at a big-truck plant in Tennessee.
Though the economy remains strong, and demand for diesel engines and buses is robust, Navistar and other truck makers are trying to head off a cyclical downturn after what some industry experts said were two years of "excessive demand" for heavy-duty rigs. Higher interest rates have made it more expensive to finance the purchase of a new truck, and higher diesel prices have forced some trucking companies to park their rigs.
As a result, over the last year, orders for heavy-duty trucks -- which often cost $80,000 to $100,000 -- fell nearly 30 percent. Freightliner said yesterday that it expected heavy-duty truck sales in North America to drop about 25 percent from 1999.
And earlier this year, Navistar laid off 800 employees in Canada, where its heavy-duty trucks are made, and the company says it may cut 500 more jobs. The company, which markets its big trucks under the International brand name, has 19,000 employees worldwide.
The Navistar announcement was contained in its third-quarter earnings release, which reported profits excluding special items of $76 million, or $1.27 a share, compared with $77 million, or $1.17 a share, in the quarter a year earlier. Revenue edged up to $1.92 billion from $1.88 billion. The results slightly beat Wall Street projections of $1.24 a share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial.
Shares of Navistar, which have been weak for much of the last year, fell $1.9375 yesterday, to $37.125.
John R. Horne, the chairman and chief executive of Navistar, said in a statement that the company was working to become less cyclical.
"The steps we plan will allow us to continue to build a healthy business in the downturn," he said, "and come out even stronger when the market turns up again."
The company said it would also take a charge in the fourth quarter related to the 1,100 job cuts.
Though heavy-truck orders, which make up about a quarter of Navistar's sales, are in decline, orders for medium-sized trucks are more stable, and sales of Navistar's diesel engines, which are used in U.P.S., U-Haul and pickup trucks, continues to grow. The company is also supplying diesel engines to the Ford Motor Company, which uses them in its sport utility vehicles. The company also said its school bus division was strong.
Analysts said today that they were not surprised by the Navistar announcement. Many investors have been warned about a drop in orders going back more than a year, and the stock prices of many of the big truck and engine makers have fallen.
"We're in the ninth inning in the stock prices," said Tobias M. Levkovich, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. "This news has all been discounted, and we think we might see a recovery by next spring in the order patterns."

HEADLINE: Deere Profit Up, But Stock Falls

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: MOLINE, Ill., Aug. 15

 BODY:
Deere & Company said today that earnings more than doubled in its fiscal third quarter as a result of a rebound in farm machinery sales, more efficient manufacturing and the contributions of a recently acquired forestry equipment maker. Yet the company's shares fell more than 10 percent.
Deere reported income of $172.4 million, or 72 cents a share, in the three-month period ending on July 31, up from $68.9 million, or 29 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $3.63 billion from $3.04 billion. 
 The results exceeded the consensus forecast of analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial, of earnings of 59 cents a share.
But Deere's shares lost $3.75 today, closing at $33.25. Even as it reported the profit increase, the company said that "weakness in the fundamentals of the farm equipment economy is likely to continue next year," with industrywide sales of farm equipment in the United States and Canada likely to be flat to 5 percent lower.
It recently acquired the Timberjack Group for $600 million to create one of the world's largest producers of forestry equipment.

HEADLINE: Program Recognizes Teachers' Extra Efforts

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

 BODY:
John Caffrey had been teaching English for 31 years when he heard about a new way to gain recognition for his skills, one available to teachers nationwide. The hitch: applicants had to pass a rigorous and time-consuming assessment that included videos of their teaching, samples of their students' work and essays analyzing their classroom techniques.
Mr. Caffrey, who was teaching middle school in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, was not the type to mind the extra work. He already had two master's degrees and was eager for another credential, even if it did not mean higher pay or career advancement. 
 "I simply wanted to be recognized as an expert in my field," Mr. Caffrey said last week. "I wanted the confidence that affirmation like that could bring."
So in 1995, Mr. Caffrey became one of the first New York City teachers to earn advanced certification from the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, an independent panel that sets standards for experienced teachers. The board, created in 1987, was recommended in a landmark report, "A Nation Prepared: Teachers for the 21st Century," by the Carnegie Forum on Education and the Economy. National board certification does not replace state certification, which remains an entry level requirement for all teachers. Instead, it helps teachers with at least three years of experience measure their skills using benchmarks set by the panel, which is mostly made up of teachers but also includes school administrators, union officials, lawmakers and business leaders.
"It recognizes people who go beyond what is expected," said Karen Zumwalt, a professor at Columbia Teachers College, "and it motivates people who want to grow professionally but aren't sure how to do it."
Last year, a record 2,967 teachers earned national board certification, bringing the total to 4,804 nationwide since 1995. But only 62 teachers in New York State have earned the credential, and of those, only 25 work in New York City. Randi Weingarten, president of the United Federation of Teachers, said the program has been slow to catch on here because there were few financial incentives attached and because city teachers were overextended as it is.
But as education has become a crucial election issue and states have scrambled to attract teachers in the face of a shortage, New York has joined several dozen other states in creating incentives for teachers to get national certification. The state now pays the $2,300 application fee for most teachers. And starting this year, the state plans to give $10,000 a year for three years to teachers who earn the advanced certification and agree to work in low-performing schools. In New York City, that means the 99 "schools under registration review," which have been designated by the state as failing.
City teachers who earn national certification also can get a $3,700 raise. But those with 30 credits beyond master's degrees -- about 44 percent of the city's teachers -- have already received that increase and cannot get more. Ms. Weingarten said this lack of an additional incentive was the main reason so few city teachers have gone through the process.
The new incentives may be working. This spring, 100 teachers in New York State submitted applications to the national board, up from 59 in 1999. Those teachers will find out in November whether they passed the assessment. Meanwhile, about 50 city teachers are applying for national certification in the coming school year, up from 20 this spring. Typically, slightly more than half of each year's applicants are certified .
During the school year, applicants videotape their classroom instruction, submit lesson plans and student work samples, and write essays reflecting on how they help students learn. They also have to write extensively about their work outside the classroom with colleagues, parents and the community. In the summer, they finish the process with written exams on the subject they teach, as well as teaching techniques.
"It takes up all the extra time that you possibly have," said Beverly Tinort, who teaches first grade at C.S. 21 in Brooklyn and earned national board certification last year. "But it's so worth it. Teachers in New York are so burdened, we never get a chance to stop and reflect on how we're doing our job. This is a blessing because it forces us to stop and reflect."
As part of the assessment, Ms. Tinort had to sit with colleagues and watch a video she had made of herself teaching sixth graders. Her colleagues picked apart everything from her body language to why girls seemed more engaged in the lesson than boys.
"Early on it was very painful to watch yourself with that critical eye," Ms. Tinort said. "But you pick up so many things that you never would have realized."
She said, "You really pick up on your weaknesses."
Others, like Mr. Caffrey, said the national certification process did not improve their skills but simply affirmed that their teaching methods were on the mark.
"When I go into classrooms now I have a sense of accomplishment," said Mr. Caffrey, who now runs a union-sponsored teacher training center in Brooklyn's District 14. "I always felt teaching was a noble profession and I worked so hard every day, and it just didn't seem to me that people in the management system recognized that. Now I have some recognition."
Skeptics question whether nationally certified teachers are really better. Chester E. Finn Jr., an assistant secretary of education under President Reagan, said there was no data on how the students of these teachers performed compared with their peers.
"After 10 years and gazillions of dollars and an awful lot of states being wooed to give bonuses to these folks, all we know is that other teachers admire their teaching," Mr. Finn said. "I need to see some proof that these teachers are more effective in terms of student learning."

HEADLINE: Tire Deaths Are Linked To Rollovers

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 15

 BODY:
Government data released this evening showed that virtually all the recent deaths linked to Firestone tires now being recalled occurred when sport utility vehicles, most of them Ford Explorers, rolled over after the tires failed.
Federal regulators said tonight that they had received more than 750 complaints about the failure of Firestone tires, involving 62 deaths. That is significantly more complaints and more deaths than previously announced, and more deaths than for any other safety recall involving autos or any kind of auto parts. The only recall of a comparable number of tires, another Firestone recall in 1978, followed far more complaints to regulators -- 14,000 -- but fewer deaths -- 41. 
 Why have the recent tire failures been unusually deadly? The tires recalled in 1978 were on cars; the tires at issue now are on sport utility vehicles and a few pickup trucks, which are harder to control when a tire fails.
Safety groups and lawyers representing crash victims are urging automakers to make changes, like redesigning the tires and the suspensions, so that sport utilities will be less likely to go out of control and roll over when a tire fails. But automakers have mostly rejected these ideas as they try to satisfy customers.
For example, putting nylon coatings inside would help hold the tires together when the tread peels off, as has happened with the Firestone tires. But that produces a bouncier ride, which few drivers choose at showrooms, so automakers seldom request the nylon from tire makers, said Brook Lindbert, the General Motors engineering director for tire and wheel systems.
Recommending a high inflation pressure for tires, which the Ford Motor Company did not do for the Explorer, reduces the likelihood of a tire failure. But more fully inflated tires produce a bumpier ride, said Tom Baughman, Ford's engineering director for North American trucks. If the recommended pressure is fairly low to begin with, there is less of a safety margin to protect against leaks that may cause tire pressure to fall to dangerously low levels, he acknowledged.
Most sport utility vehicles still use the stiff suspensions of the pickup trucks on which they were based. These shared suspensions hold down the cost and improve performance on rough terrain, a feature many drivers cherish even if they never leave the asphalt.
Balancing these often conflicting demands is difficult. The question now in court cases and for regulators is whether too much safety has been compromised, and whether automakers have set a balance too far in the direction of customer desires and too little in the interest of safety.
Led by Ford, which installed most of the recalled Firestone tires on its Ford Explorer vehicles, automakers say that they have set an appropriate balance between customer satisfaction and safety. Even with the deaths attributed to Firestone tires, Explorers have a 22 percent lower death rate in rollovers than competitors' midsize sport utilities and a 24 percent lower death rate in crashes over all, said Ernie Grush, Ford's manager of safety data analysis.
While sport utility occupants have high death rates in rollovers, their overall death rates are no higher than for car occupants. This is because sport utilities fare well in collisions with lower-riding cars, he said, adding that, "Customers should look at and consider the overall accident rate in all types of circumstances."
While the deaths now being attributed to tires might seem numerous to Explorer owners and are large for a recall of tires or auto parts, they represent a smaller problem by traffic safety standards.
The tire-related deaths spread over the last several years are just a tiny part of the much bigger problem of rollovers, which kill 9,500 Americans a year. Rollovers, in turn, are just part of the overall problem of automobile crashes, which claim 41,000 lives annually.
The high incidence of rollovers in the tire incidents could, however, focus attention on a move by Senate Republicans and the auto industry to block publication by the government of rollover ratings for cars and for light trucks, a category that includes minivans and pickup trucks as well as sport utilities.
After 27 years of study and numerous objections by the auto industry, federal regulators announced plans on May 25 to begin the ratings this autumn. But after strenuous auto industry lobbying, the Senate inserted a little-noticed provision in the transportation budget this summer barring regulators from issuing the rules and ordering the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a one-year study of the regulators' technique for the ratings. The House version of the transportation budget does not contain this provision, and House and Senate conferees are scheduled to work out the differences in the budgets early next month.
Michael Stanton, the senior lobbyist for the Washington-based Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, said the regulators' proposed rating system was too imprecise. The system compares a vehicle's width to the height of its center of gravity. The system does not take into account high-technology features like roof-mounted air bags, or the computerized vehicle stability systems that Ford plans to offer.
But Ricardo Martinez, the administrator until last autumn of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which regulates vehicle safety, said that the rating system was reliable and should be adopted quickly. The system assigns vehicles one to five stars, like government crash test ratings.
Sport utilities are more prone than cars to roll over if they lose a tire, although rollovers also depend on variables like driver skill, Mr. Lindbert of G.M. said. The higher a vehicle's center of gravity, the more the vehicle and its occupants tend to lean forward during braking, and this makes it important to retain as much traction as possible on the rear tires to keep the back end of the vehicle under control, he said.
If a rear tire develops problems, Mr. Lindbert said, "in many regards you have the potential to get sideways on the road," which tends to produce rollovers.
Tonight's government data showed that while front and rear tires are subject to failure, rear tire failures caused all but 2 of the 131 rollovers reported to regulators. Not all rollovers resulted in death. Calculating the frequency of rollovers when tires fail is almost impossible because no one knows for sure how many tire failures there are. The government does not collect the data and tire makers do not share their data on their own brands.
An analysis of federal data on deaths in tire-related accidents from 1990 to 1997, the most recent year available, shows that 91 percent of the deaths of occupants in Ford Explorers involved rollovers. Only 28 percent of the tire-related deaths in cars involved rollovers, said Leon Robertson, a retired Yale University epidemiologist who analyzed the data and who has also worked for plaintiff lawyers over the years.
Tonight's government data included public complaints of 52 deaths in Explorers that rolled over after Firestone tires failed, and five more deaths in Explorers for which the complaints did not mention whether rollovers occurred. Only two Explorers did not roll over. The remaining deaths also involved rollovers, notably a Chevrolet Blazer and GMC Suburban. G.M., Nissan and Toyota use Firestone tire sizes that have not been recalled, and DaimlerChrysler does not use Firestone tires.
Even before the Firestone tire problems, automakers had begun to make changes to their sport utilities. The next generation of Ford Explorers, which will go on sale in January, has a softer, car-like suspension of coiled springs instead of a truck suspension of steel bars that flex when the vehicle goes over bumps.
With the new suspension will go new tires. Ford decided several years ago that the new Explorers would no longer use 15-inch tires but would have 16-inch tires instead. The 16-inch size has not been recalled -- although some plaintiff lawyers have called for this -- and is already used on the more expensive Explorers now. The tire has a recommended inflation pressure of 30 pounds per square inch, four pounds more than the 15-inch tires being recalled.
Wes Sherwood, a Ford spokesman, said tonight that even before the current problems, Ford was considering a pressure of more than 30 pounds for the next generation of Explorers, particularly for the rear tires.
But safety experts caution that the biggest safety gains will come not from tire changes but from motorists' buckling their seat belts. Government statisticians say that halving the frequency of unbuckled motorists, to one-sixth of front-seat occupants from one-third, would save several thousand lives each year.

Charts: "Tire Trade-Offs"
Safety groups and plaintiffs' lawyers disagree with automakers over how to make sport utility vehicles safe while preserving their market appeal. The debate has centered on the recall of Firestone tires installed mainly on Ford Explorer sport utility vehicles, but is part of a broader controversy over tire and sport utility design.
 
TIRE INFLATION
 
Safety Groups and Lawyers
Sport utility tires should be inflated to at least 30 pounds per square inch, because underinflation strains the tire and can cause blowouts.
 
Automakers
Underinflation is a safety problem only below 20 p.s.i. Inflating cold tires to 26 p.s.i. at the service station provides an adequate margin of safety against leaks. Higher pressures cause a bouncy, truck-like ride unpopular with buyers who have recently switched to S.U.V.'s from cars.
 
SUSPENSIONS
 
Safety Groups and Lawyers
S.U.V. suspensions are stiff because they come from pickup trucks, so automakers call for soft tires to compensate.
 
Automakers
For off road use, S.U.V.'s need stiff truck suspensions to carry heavy loads. In any event, more S.U.V.'s are being equipped with car suspensions, because few S.U.V. buyers go off-road.
 
TIRE DESIGN
 
Safety Groups and Lawyers
The steel belts on radial tires for S.U.V.'s should have nylon coatings to keep the tires from coming apart. Tire makers do not install the nylon coatings to save pennies per tire.
 
Automakers
Nylon coatings are unnecessary, except on high-speed cars like the Chevrolet Corvette. The coatings produce a bumpier ride that few S.U.V. buyers want.
 
ROLLOVERS
 
Safety Groups and Lawyers
In general, S.U.V.'s roll over too readily.
 
Automakers
While S.U.V.'s roll over more often than cars, overall death rates are similar, because S.U.V. occupants are less likely than car occupants to die in collisions with other vehicles.
 
(Sources: Public Citizen; C. Tab Turner, plaintiffs' lawyer; Ford; General Motors)(pg. C21)
 
"Most Likely To Roll Over"
Cars and sport utility vehicles have similar overall death rates (about 145 deaths per million registered vehicles a year), but the cause of death in an S.U.V. accident is more likely to be from the vehicle rolling over.
 
PERCENTAGE OF CRASH DEATHS FROM ROLLOVERS
 
Sport utility vehicles -- 62%
Vans and pickups -- 40%
Cars -- 22%

HEADLINE: Warring Populisms

 BODY:
Depending on your point of view, it was either old-time religion night or dinosaur time at the Democratic National Convention. Two of the party's great roarers, Senator Ted Kennedy and the Rev. Jesse Jackson, were on hand to remind the faithful of the party's traditional New Deal values. John F. Kennedy's only surviving child, Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, reminded voters of that golden era when Democrats like her father could depend on a solid base of blue-collar voters. Earlier in the day Vice President Al Gore was in Michigan, the heart of union country, to warn that "the powerful interests are going to fight against us with everything they've got" to prevent the Democratic ticket from defending working families.
Even before Franklin D. Roosevelt's politically productive attacks on financial "royalists," economic populism was a staple of Democratic campaigns. For years, when Democrats turned to their venerable themes of economic justice and fairer income distribution, the Republicans accused them of promoting class warfare, but to little avail. Then under the tutelage of Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, the G.O.P. learned to trump the Democrats' appeals to middle-class financial solidarity with their own appeals to Main Street in the form of a cultural populism built around a powerful set of patriotic, religious and racial symbols. Now both Mr. Gore and his Republican opponent, Gov. George W. Bush, seem eager for a renewed clash centered on their competing brands of populism. 
 Although the apostate Clinton strategist, Dick Morris, argues that Mr. Gore is making a mistake to revive "liberal" economic themes, both Mr. Gore and President Clinton seem confident the Democratic ticket can win an argument over who gets the fruits of what Mr. Gore calls "unprecedented economic abundance." In one sense, the target presented by Mr. Bush, with his old-money pedigree and his oil-patch running mate, is irresistible. He would spend billions on tax relief for investors, top earners and inheritors of large estates. His plan is a perfect setup for Mr. Gore's favorite pitch that he "fights for working families" while the G.O.P. remains the party of "the wealthy, the well connected and the powerful."
Mr. Gore's rhetoric, like that of Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Jackson, has a root system that dates back to William Jennings Bryan. Populism in its original form arose as a protest against the ability of agricultural, railroad and industrial interests to buy influence over government policy. Today's soft-money game is a lineal descendant of that form of corruption -- a fact that undercuts the purity of Mr. Gore's claim to be an opponent of special interests. In fact, the Democrats have been lapping up soft money from corporations and wealthy donors, having already passed $120 million before starting the fund-raising events associated with their convention. As John Broder and Don Van Natta Jr. reported in yesterday's Times, corporate donors and lobbyists play the money game at both conventions in what Senator Russell Feingold calls a "system of legalized extortion and legalized bribery." The inescapable conclusion is that Mr. Gore, no amateur exaggerator, grossly exaggerates his party's independence of special interests.
Even so, the convention oratory reflects an underlying reality that the Democrats do offer a fairer approach to parceling out the benefits of the Clinton boom. Mr. Gore's promise to take on the drug companies and health management organizations does have more credibility than Mr. Bush's less aggressive proposals. Moreover, should he carry out his campaign promise to outlaw soft money contributions that have tainted both conventions, Mr. Gore will have put some real muscle behind the Democrats' quadrennial exercise in ringing the century-old chimes of economic populism.

HEADLINE: THE DEMOCRATS: THE VICE PRESIDENT;
Gore Grabs Torch From Clinton, Hoping to Avoid Burns

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: MONROE, Mich., Aug. 15

 BODY:
With a bear hug and a slight nudge, President Clinton pushed his understudy, Al Gore, to center stage today, relinquishing the limelight to the man he hopes will succeed him.
It was a metaphoric ceremony that Vice President Gore has longed for as Mr. Clinton has effortlessly dominated news coverage and captured public attention -- and overshadowed Mr. Gore's efforts to present himself as a leader in his own right. 
 Mr. Clinton tried today to pass that torch to Mr. Gore here before a crowd of more than 15,000 people, the largest audience Mr. Gore has seen since he officially announced his candidacy more than a year ago.
"The nominee of the Democratic Party," Mr. Clinton said, "my partner and friend for the last eight years, understands where we are, where we're going and how it will affect ordinary citizens more than any other public figure in this country over the last 20 years."
Vouching for Mr. Gore, Mr. Clinton, who was operating on three hours of sleep after delivering his valedictory speech in Los Angeles on Monday, added: "I hope you'll take my word for this, because I spent most of my adult life studying economics and the development of our country. The things that have happened in the last eight years -- the good things -- are nothing compared to the good things that can happen in the next eight years. Nothing!"
Mr. Gore, who had been standing ramrod straight behind the president with Mrs. Clinton and Tipper Gore, Mr. Gore's wife, embraced Mr. Clinton and shed his jacket as he moved to the lectern.
"I want to thank you, Mr. President, for giving me a chance to serve my country for the last eight years," Mr. Gore said, "by working to help strengthen your hand."
He introduced his wife as "the woman I love," and went on to tell the stories of several people whose lives had been improved by Clinton administration programs. He said that Mr. Clinton had built a strong foundation for the nation and that the election was about whether voters wanted to build on that foundation or allow it to erode. Mr. Gore did not mention his Republican opponent, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, but he did refer to the governor's proposal for an across-the-board tax cut of $1.3 trillion over 10 years. Mr. Gore has proposed tax cuts of about $500 billion.
"You know, Bill Clinton worked hard to get this economy right," Mr. Gore said. "And I'm pledging to you here today, I am not going to let the other side wreck it and take it away from us. We're going to keep the prosperity going."
It was not clear whether this ceremony would usher in for Mr. Gore a transfer of attention -- and an enhancement of his standing with the electorate -- or whether Mr. Clinton would continue to steal the show.
As it was, Mr. Clinton upstaged Mr. Gore as soon as the symbolic "passing of the torch" was over . (No object was actually passed, as producers of television news programs had been led to believe might happen.) As Mr. Gore began speaking, eyes were diverted to Mr. Clinton who was draping his arms around Mrs. Clinton and Mrs. Gore.
After they left, the Clintons stopped at a McDonald's, an event that made a huge splash with local residents.
Mr. Clinton marked the moment with a crispy chicken sandwich and fries. Whether he was anticipating one of the advantages of being an ordinary citizen or downing some comfort food to soothe his angst over the dimming of the limelight, he seemed cheerful enough.
"If I'm going to be a citizen again, I'm going to have to start getting used to it," the president said as he shrugged and then slipped a $20 tip to the teenage waitresses, telling them to "go out and have some fun."
Monroe, a town of 22,600 people near Lake Erie, was chosen because it represents the challenge ahead for Mr. Gore. It is a swing district that includes both rural and suburban voters, both high-tech and low-tech workers and an equal number of Democrats and Republicans.
It is a bellwether area of the state, having voted for winners in most presidential elections in modern history. A survey from earlier this month, after Mr. Gore picked Senator Joseph I. Lieberman as his running mate, showed Governor Bush winning the support of 45 percent of those likely to vote and Mr. Gore 37 percent.
"If Gore can win here, he can win the state" and the national election, said Ed Sarpolus, a pollster in Lansing. "This is one of Gore's toughest audiences. His problem is still Bill Clinton, the person."

HEADLINE: THE DEMOCRATS: THE ELECTORATE;
Passed Torch, Some Say, Leaves Its Glow Behind

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON 

DATELINE: LOMBARD, Ill., Aug. 15

 BODY:
Just as Robin Wilson settled into her sofa to watch President Clinton's speech to Democrats on Monday, her telephone rang.
It was Howard Ellis, an old co-worker, calling so he and Mrs. Wilson, a 67-year-old retired postal employee, could talk about the speech as they watched it. 
 "That charisma just shines," Mrs. Wilson told her friend as the president spoke about his humble roots and how grateful he was for his time in office. "It's a shame that he can't run again."
"It sure is," Mr. Ellis responded.
In the living rooms of Chicago's western suburbs, even independent voters said the speech made them a bit nostalgic. There was even some new fondness for Hillary Rodham Clinton, who spoke to the convention crowd before her husband.
But although most of the half-dozen viewers who were interviewed seemed to feel warmth toward the Clintons, they were more subdued about their hopes for the Democrat vying to be his successor, Vice President Al Gore. Some even said the president's performance made Mr. Gore's task more difficult.
"Oh, I suppose I'll vote for Gore," Mrs. Wilson said with a labored sigh that spoke more ambivalence than enthusiasm. "But my heart's not in it."
Even a Republican like David King, though, a 35-year-old computer software worker, sounded like a fan of President Clinton's after the speech.
"Boy, I was really impressed," Mr. King said. "The way he rebutted every single point at the Republican convention -- saying the good economy was a choice, not a chance -- that was awfully effective."
In Mr. King's view, the Democrats can scarcely take credit for all the nation's prosperity in recent years. The ascension of the Internet, he said, probably had more to do with soaring stock prices and dwindling unemployment than any policies directed by the White House.
Still, Mr. Clinton's closing argument, as he called it, could make even a skeptical juror think twice.
"He was just very persuasive," Mr. King said. "That part where he asked people to look at the economy now, and remember it eight years ago, it does make you think."
Not every convention viewer was so inspired, of course. Dr. Ann Gose, 62, a cardiovascular surgeon, said she was mostly struck by what she considered the president's profound self-centeredness.
"He goes on and on about his wife and Gore, but it eventually comes back to himself, like it always does with this guy," Dr. Gose said. "You watch him, and it's like he couldn't let go. He needs all this. I feel sorry for him."
And Charles Grimm, an engineering salesman in his 60's, was throwing no bouquets at his television set.
"Looking at him makes me ill," said Mr. Grimm, an ex-marine who said he had detested Mr. Clinton from the start of his presidency and had grown to loathe him even more.
"He gives a good speech, no doubt about it," Mr. Grimm said. "But it's all sound bites. And I just can't believe anything he says."
The speech by Mrs. Clinton, who is running for the United States Senate in New York, did not seem to provoke such visceral reactions, positive or negative, among the Chicago suburbanites. But several said they were a bit surprised to find her likable, especially in light of the portrait her detractors paint of her as conniving, bloodless and power hungry.
Teri Turek, a 36-year-old insurance clerk, said she was struck by Mrs. Clinton's sense of compassion. "I didn't really like her before," said Ms. Turek, a political independent. "But when she talked, she seemed so totally for family, for children. And she was sincere. She looked you in the eye."
Ms. Turek added, "And you've got to respect her for being such a go-getter, considering everything that he's put her through."
Even Mr. Grimm had nice things to say about Mrs. Clinton.
"She came across a little better than I thought she would, strong and sincere," Mr. Grimm said. In particular, he gave her high marks for praising Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, the Democratic vice-presidential candidate, who had been critical of Mr. Clinton's sexual relationship with a young White House intern.
On one point, each viewer agreed: It was a relief that neither the president nor Mrs. Clinton talked about the scandal that nearly drove him from office. None of them wanted any displays of contrition or public appeals, as one put it, "for some kind of closure."
Carrie Addison, 44, who owns a convenience-store franchise, just groaned at the mention of Mr. Clinton's moral lapses. "We've had enough about that," Ms. Addison said, a sentiment that was expressed by every one of the voters. "It's over and done with."
Whether these voters considered Mr. Clinton to be a star or a villain, it was clear that they saw him as the headline attraction, drawing attention from Mr. Gore.
As Mr. Grimm saw it, "Clinton is going to completely overshadow Gore."
And despite the president's repeated mention of Mr. Gore as his full partner in the White House, these voters expressed skepticism that White House policies were much influenced by the second in command.
"The things that were put through, that was President Clinton," Mrs. Wilson said. "And you get the feeling, that's all over now."
Having taped the speech for her grandchildren, she said: "He was witty, funny, to the point. I like what he said about building one America. And I think he really means that. I feel kind of sad, really."

HEADLINE: THE DEMOCRATS: THE PARTY'S PROGRAM;
Excerpts From Platform Approved by Democratic National Convention

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the platform approved yesterday by the Democratic National Convention.
 
INTRODUCTION
Today, America finds itself in the midst of prosperity, progress and peace. We have arrived at this moment because of the hard work of the American people. This election will be about the big choices we have to make to secure prosperity that is broadly shared and progress that reaches all families in this new American century. In the year 2000, the Democratic Party stands ready to meet that challenge and to build on our achievements. . . . 
 If one theme runs through this 2000 Democratic platform, it is this: if America is to secure prosperity, progress, peace and security for all, we cannot afford to go back. We must move forward together and we must not leave anyone behind.
 
PROSPERITY
Democrats believe that to further our prosperity and make sure all Americans are ready to reap the rewards of the new economy we need thinking as innovative as the moment in which we live. First, we must continue the fiscal discipline that has been the hallmark of the past eight years -- that means paying down the debt and offering the right kind of tax cuts. Second, we must use our unprecedented prosperity to secure Social Security and Medicare for future generations. Third, we must invest in the most precious resource we have -- the American people and their skills and ability to innovate. Fourth, we must continue to reinvent government so that it works better and costs less and is in line with the online world. Fifth, we must open new markets to American products at home and around the world. Finally, we must reinforce the basic American bargain of requiring and rewarding hard work and we must provide Americans with the opportunity to participate in key decisions at work and in their communities. . . .
 
Retirement Security
Al Gore is committed to making Social Security safe and secure for more than half a century by using the savings from our current unprecedented prosperity to strengthen the Social Security trust fund in preparation for the retirement of the baby boom generation. We now have an extraordinary opportunity to maintain Social Security. In addition, we can reform it, not the wrong way, with proposals such as raising the retirement age, but the right way, with fiscal discipline and by making it fairer for widows, widowers and mothers.
Retirement security comes on many fronts. Democrats have successfully passed reforms to simplify the pension process for small businesses, expand pension portability and protect employee pension funds. Democrats believe that workers' pensions should be protected and more portable. We also believe that changes in every American's pension rights should be fully disclosed. This is becoming increasingly important today, as pensions are progressively being shifted from a workers' benefit plan to a workers' contribution plan. We believe these changes need to be carefully examined by independent agencies to make sure they abide by current federal law. Democrats support President Clinton's veto of the Republican tax scheme that would have diminished antidiscrimination protections for middle-class and lower-income workers.
To build on the success of Social Security, Al Gore has proposed the creation of retirement savings plus -- voluntary, tax-free, personally controlled, privately managed savings accounts with a government match that would help couples build a nest egg of up to $400,000. Separate from Social Security, retirement savings plus accounts would let Americans save and invest on top of the foundation of Social Security's guaranteed benefit. Under this plan, the federal government would match individual contributions with tax credits, with the hardest-pressed working families getting the most assistance.
 
Investing in Americans
We cannot afford -- materially or morally -- to let another generation of American children pass through inadequate schools before we make needed changes that will save them from a lifetime of frustration and limited horizons. The time for action is now.
By the end of the next presidential term, we should have a fully qualified, well-trained teacher in every classroom in every school in every part of this country -- and every teacher should pass a rigorous test to get there.
By the end of the next presidential term, every failing school in America should be turned around or shut down and reopened under new public leadership.
By the end of the next presidential term, we should ensure that no high school student graduates unless they have mastered the basics of reading and math, so that the diploma they receive really means something.
By the end of the next presidential term, parents across the nation ought to be able to choose the best public school for their children.
By the end of the next presidential term, every eighth grader in America should be computer literate.
By the end of the next presidential term, high-quality, affordable preschool should be fully available to every family, for every child, in every community in America.
By the end of the next presidential term, every child should learn in a safe, modern classroom with the most up-to-date technology.
By the end of the next presidential term, the achievement gap between students of color and the rest of America's students should be eliminated.
Consistently bad schools should be shut down. No excuses. No exceptions. . . . Charter schools and other nontraditional public school options can free school leaders, teachers, parents and community leaders to use their creativity and innovation to help all students meet the highest academic standards. The Democratic Party will triple the number of charter schools in the nation. And we will ensure that these charter schools are fully accountable financially and academically to students and the communities they serve, and that they are indeed making progress in maximizing student achievement. All public schools should have the freedom to design their curriculum within high standards, and all public schools should compete for students -- and we should start by bringing universal public school choice and competition to our lowest-performing public schools.
Let there be no mistake: what America needs are public schools that compete with one another and are held accountable for results, not private school vouchers that drain resources from public schools and hand over the public's hard-earned tax dollars to private schools with no accountability. . . .
 
Opening Markets Around the World
The president should be able to negotiate trade agreements with the nations of the world and should include worker rights, human rights and environmental protections in those agreements, as well as market-opening initiatives. At the same time, Al Gore will challenge American companies to ensure labor protections and worker safety at their overseas operations. And United States representatives at the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank should also seek to advance fair treatment for workers internationally. We should create an environment in which electronic commerce can flourish globally as it has here in America. We are committed to supporting the rights of workers around the world. And we should vigorously monitor trade agreements to make sure other nations are not shirking their responsibilities. . . .
 
PROGRESS
 
Fighting Crime
A shocking level of gun violence on our streets and in our schools has shown America the need to keep guns away from those who shouldn't have them in ways that respect the rights of hunters, sportsmen and legitimate gun owners. The Columbine tragedy struck America's heart, but in its wake Republicans have done nothing to keep guns away from those who should not have them.
Democrats believe that we should fight gun crime on all fronts, with stronger laws and stronger enforcement. That's why Democrats fought and passed the Brady Law and the assault weapons ban. We increased federal, state and local gun crime prosecution by 22 percent since 1992. Now gun crime is down by 35 percent.
Now we must do even more. We need mandatory child safety locks, to protect our children. We should require a photo license ID, a full background check and a gun safety test to buy a new handgun in America. We support more federal gun prosecutors, A.T.F. agents and inspectors and giving states and communities another 10,000 prosecutors to fight gun crime.
Good policing demands mutual trust and respect between the community and the police. We shouldn't let the acts of a few rogue officers undermine that trust or the reputation of the outstanding work of the vast majority of our dedicated men and women in blue. That is why we need to end the unjust practice of racial profiling in America -- because it's not only unfair, it is inconsistent with America's community policing success, it is a violation of the basic American principle of innocent until proven guilty, it views Americans as members of groups instead of as individuals, and it is just plain shoddy policing. . . .
 
Universal Health Coverage
We must redouble our efforts to bring the uninsured into coverage step-by-step and as soon as possible. We should guarantee access to affordable health care for every child in America. We should expand coverage to working families, including more Medicaid assistance to help with the transition from welfare to work. And we should also seek to ensure that dislocated workers are provided affordable health care. We should make health care accessible and affordable for small businesses. In addition, Americans aged 55 to 65 -- the fastest growing group of uninsured -- should be allowed to buy into the Medicare program to get the coverage they need. By taking these steps, we can move our nation closer to the goal of providing universal health coverage for all Americans.
 
A Real Patients' Bill of Rights
Medical decisions should be made by patients and their doctors and nurses, not accountants and bureaucrats at the end of a phone line a thousand miles away. It is time we meaningfully addressed concerns about the quality of care and about the decline of patient access, trust and satisfaction. People need to get the health care they need, when they need it, without having to leap endless hurdles. Americans need a real, enforceable patients' bill of rights with the right to see a specialist, the right to appeal decisions to an outside board, guaranteed coverage of emergency room care and the right to sue when they are unfairly denied coverage. . . .
 
Protecting and Strengthening Medicare
It is time we ended the tragedy of elderly Americans being forced to choose between meals and medication. It is time we modernized Medicare with a new prescription drug benefit. This is an essential step in making sure that the best new cures and therapies are available to our seniors and disabled Americans. We cannot afford to permit our seniors to receive only part of the medical care they need.
Democrats believe Medicare is worth fighting for and worth saving. With the number of Americans on Medicare expected to double in the next 35 years, Al Gore has stepped up and taken responsibility by proposing a Medicare lock box that would ensure Medicare surpluses are used for Medicare -- and not for pork barrel spending or tax giveaways. We should also modernize Medicare by promoting competitive prices and remain vigilant against Medicare fraud.
 
Choice
The Democratic Party stands behind the right of every woman to choose, consistent with Roe v. Wade, and regardless of ability to pay. We believe it is a fundamental constitutional liberty that individual Americans -- not government -- can best take responsibility for making the most difficult and intensely personal decisions regarding reproduction. This year's Supreme Court rulings show to us all that eliminating a woman's right to choose is only one justice away. That's why the stakes in this election are as high as ever.
Our goal is to make abortion less necessary and more rare, not more difficult and more dangerous. We support contraceptive research, family planning, comprehensive family life education and policies that support healthy childbearing. The abortion rate is dropping. Now we must continue to support efforts to reduce unintended pregnancies, and we call on all Americans to take personal responsibility to meet this important goal.
The Democratic Party is a party of inclusion. We respect the individual conscience of each American on this difficult issue, and we welcome all our members to participate at every level of our party. This is why we are proud to put into our platform the very words which Republicans refused to let Bob Dole put into their 1996 platform and which they refused to even consider putting in their platform in 2000: "While the party remains steadfast in its commitment to advancing its historic principles and ideals, we also recognize that members of our party have deeply held and sometimes differing views on issues of personal conscience like abortion and capital punishment. We view this diversity of views as a source of strength, not as a sign of weakness, and we welcome into our ranks all Americans who may hold differing positions on these and other issues. Recognizing that tolerance is a virtue, we are committed to resolving our differences in a spirit of civility, hope and mutual respect."
 
Protecting Our Environment
Al Gore is committed to restoring the Everglades, protecting the coasts of California and Florida and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge from oil and gas drilling and preserving our untouched forests, including the Tongass, from logging and development. With regard to public lands, Democrats believe that communities, environmental interests and government agencies should work together to protect our public resources, critical habitat areas and wildlands while ensuring the vitality of local economies. We will work together to find land-based alternatives and decontamination technologies that will permanently end the ocean disposal of contaminated dredge spoils. . . .
We should invest in roads, bridges, light rail systems, cleaner buses, the aviation system, our national passenger railroad, Amtrak, and high-speed trains that would give Americans choices freeing them from traffic, smog-choked cities and being held hostage to foreign oil. We should ensure that urban communities affected by the presence of airports which create increased levels of noise and pollution be provided mitigation support to address these concerns. We must also ensure that we maintain adequate public funding and public administration of publicly operated and delivered transportation services, without gutting collective bargaining agreements or longstanding worker protections. In these and other areas, we will encourage project labor agreements, fostering labor-management cooperation, quality development and efficient use of public monies. Today, technology has advanced to the point that we can drive the kind of cars we like and live in the kind of houses we like -- while being kind to the earth. We should use some of our budget surplus to help Americans take advantage of these new opportunities. With the right investments, these new environmentally friendly technologies can create new jobs for American workers. . . .
And we must dramatically reduce climate-disrupting and health-threatening pollution in this country, while making sure that all nations of the world participate in this effort. Environmental standards should be raised throughout the world in order to preserve the earth and to prevent a destructive race to the bottom wherein countries compete for production and jobs based on who can do the least to protect the environment. There will be no new bureaucracies, no new agencies, no new organizations. But there will be action and there will be progress. The earth truly is in the balance -- and we are the guardians of that harmony. . . .
 
Renewing Our Democracy and Campaign Finance Reform
In this year's presidential primaries, it became clear that the Republican establishment is violently opposed to John McCain's call for reforming our democracy. Al Gore supports John McCain's campaign for political reform. In fact, the McCain-Feingold bill is the very first piece of legislation that a President Al Gore will submit to Congress, and he will fight for it until it becomes the law of the land.
Then he will go even further -- much further. He will insist on tough new lobbying reform, publicly guaranteed TV time for debates and advocacy by candidates and a crackdown on special interest issue ads. Most boldly of all, Al Gore has proposed a public-private, nonpartisan Democracy Endowment which will raise money from Americans and finance Congressional elections, with no other contributions allowed to candidates who accept the funding. This will let our politics be free from the influence of special interests and let Americans believe in their own democracy again. . . .
 
PEACE
Al Gore and the Democratic Party know that we must be able to meet any military challenge from a position of dominance. But Al Gore and the Democratic Party also recognize that there is a new security agenda -- threats that affect the entire world and transcend political borders.
During the past century, we have learned that if we wish to avoid war, we must be strong enough to deter aggression, but also farsighted enough to invest in peace. Now it is time to apply this lesson to the new global challenges we face, to shape a new strategy of forward engagement to guide our conduct around the world. Forward engagement means addressing problems early in their development before they become crises, addressing them as close to the source of the problem as possible and having the forces and resources to deal with these threats as soon after their emergence as possible. . . .
 
Protecting Our Interests and Securing Our Values
The lessons of the past eight years show that the nation must be prepared to use force when American interests and values are truly at stake. We cannot be the world's policeman, and we must be discriminating in our approach. But where the stakes are high, when we can assure ourselves that nothing short of military engagement can secure our national interest, when we know that we have the military forces available for the task, when we have made our best efforts to join with allies, and when the cost is proportionate to the objective, we must be ready to act. . . .
 
Engaging Former Enemies
Democrats understand that we must engage former enemies. This administration's efforts to design new relationships with the Russian Federation and China have been continuously subjected to every form of harassment and attack by the Republicans, but they have been in America's national interest and they have been the right thing to do.
We recognize that Russia's historic transition to a market democracy is difficult, all the more reason we must continue to engage Russia. We recognize that Russian democracy is challenged by corruption that deeply penetrates her society, all the more reason to engage Russia on behalf of reform. We recognize that Russia has her own self-interest and concerns that can and do run contrary to ours, all the more reason to search for constructive forms of cooperation. We deeply disagree with what Russia is doing in Chechnya and remain concerned about signs of Russian efforts to intimidate the press, all the more reason to step up our discussions with them on those issues. The Democratic Party is prepared to pursue American objectives as needed even at the cost of friction with Russia. But it is also of tremendous potential benefit to us if we can nurture a sense of common purpose and trust. . . .
Similarly, we must continue to engage China -- a nation with 1.3 billion people, a nuclear arsenal, and a role in the 21st century that is destined to be one of the basic facts of international life. We must search out ways to cooperate across a broad range of issues, such as the environment and trade, while at the same time insisting on adherence to international standards on human rights, freedom, the persecution of religions, the suppression of Tibet and bellicose threats directed at Taiwan. . . .
 
Preventing New Physical Threats
We reject Republican plans to endanger our security with massive unilateral cuts in our arsenal and to construct an unproven, expensive and ill-conceived missile defense system that would plunge us into a new arms race. Al Gore and the Democratic Party support the development of the technology for a limited national missile defense system that will be able to defend the United States against a missile attack from a state that has acquired weapons of mass destruction despite our efforts to block their proliferation. A decision to deploy such a system should be made based on four criteria: the nature of the threat, the feasibility of the technology, the cost and the overall impact on our national security, including arms control. The Democratic Party places a high value on ensuring that any such system is compatible with the Antiballistic Missile Treaty. We also support continued work in significantly reducing strategic and other nuclear weapons, recognizing that the goal is strategic nuclear stability at progressively lower levels.

Re "U.S. Child Poverty Rate Fell as Economy Grew, but Is Above 1979 Level" (news article, Aug. 11):
You report that elected officials and advocates for children cite low wages and higher costs for child care and living as primary reasons for the stubborn persistence of child poverty. Yet not mentioned is what many scholars view as the main reason: continuing high rates of unwed childbearing and divorce. 
 Children in mother-headed homes are five times more likely to be poor than children in married-couple homes. About 60 percent of all poor children today live in one-parent homes. Scholars have found that the explosion of one-parent homes in the 1970's and 1980's accounts for almost all of the rise in child poverty during this period. Unless we turn around the trend of family fragmentation, child poverty rates in the United States are likely to remain high.

To the Editor:
Re your Aug. 11 news article reporting that the national child poverty rate is higher today than in 1979:
This increase is almost exclusively a Hispanic phenomenon. According to Census Bureau statistics, the poverty rate for black children is 4.5 percentage points lower today than in 1979, while the rate for white non-Hispanic children is one-half percentage point higher. But the rate for Hispanic children has increased from 28 percent in poverty to 34.4 percent, and the number of Hispanic children in the United States population has more than doubled. 
 Ignoring these facts can lead to confusion about the nature and causes of child poverty, as well as inappropriate and poorly designed remedies.

HEADLINE: THE DEMOCRATS: THE KENNEDY FACTOR;
40 Years Later, Invoking Spirit of New Frontier

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Aug. 15

 BODY:
Invoking the themes that her father offered here 40 years ago this summer, Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg stepped out of her guarded private life and onto the stage of the Democratic convention tonight to lend the family name to Al Gore's presidential campaign and to thank the nation for its support through what had been another difficult year for the Kennedys.
"I thank all Americans for making me and John, and all of our family, a part of your families -- for reaching out and sustaining us through the good times, and the difficult ones, and for helping us dream my father's dream," Ms. Schlossberg said. "As I look across this hall, and across this country, I know that my father's spirit lives on, and I thank all of you." 
 "Now, it is our turn to prove that the New Frontier was not a place in time, but a timeless call," she said, referring to the signature phrase of her father's years in office. "Now, we are the New Frontier. And now when many of us are doing so well, it is time once again to ask more of ourselves. As much as we need a prosperous economy, we also need a prosperity of kindness and decency."
It was a poignant moment for Ms. Schlossberg. Her simple agreement to speak here tonight -- she has all but disappeared from public view since her father's assassination in November 1963 -- was a reminder that she is now the only surviving member of the Kennedy family that occupied the White House from 1961 through 1963. Ms. Schlossberg's brother, John Jr., who enjoyed public attention almost as much as his sister shunned it, died in an airplane crash last summer.
Ms. Schlossberg was one of four members of the extended Kennedy family who spoke here today, and her official task was to introduce "Uncle Teddy," Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts.
She took the stage to the sound of the theme from "Camelot," the 1960's musical that became identified with her father's administration.
Not surprisingly, her remarks were filled with mentions of her father, who died when she was 5 years old. They were a reminder of the continuing sway that the Kennedy family in general, and John F. Kennedy in particular, wields among Democrats at a convention where many of the delegates were not even born when Mr. Kennedy was president.
She recalled her upbringing, saying: "I was lucky enough to grow up in a world where adults taught by example. They dreamed impossible dreams, yet they fought hard each day to make those dreams come true." And she reminded the audience that her father, 40 years ago, wanted "not only to make better the world that surrounds us but to dream of something more."
Ms. Schlossberg delivered the speech in a city that is for the Kennedys both a place of triumph, where her father was nominated to run for president, and of tragedy, because Robert F. Kennedy was assassinated not far from where Ms. Schlossberg spoke tonight, while he was campaigning for president in 1968.
Indeed, she alluded to the losses that her family has suffered through violence, saying: "If we believe that we have seen enough gun violence in our land and in our lifetimes -- that guns should no longer take the lives of those we love -- then it is up to us. If we believe in these things, then it is up to us to elect Al Gore and Joe Lieberman."
Ms. Schlossberg was poised but seemed a bit nervous as she looked out at a conventional hall crammed with delegates, onlookers and reporters. She proceeded to quote her father, suggesting that what he said in Los Angeles when he was nominated for president was as relevant today as it was then.
"Our call is to the young at heart, regardless of age," he said then. "The whole world looks to see what we will do. We cannot fail their trust; we cannot fail to try."

HEADLINE: As Some Fight A Park Plan, Its Supporters See Elitism;
Many in Brooklyn Hts. Fear Hordes of Visitors

BYLINE: By JULIAN E. BARNES 

 BODY:
The flags hanging from the windows of homes lining the only cobblestone blocks in Brooklyn Heights all bear the same Revolutionary War motto, "Don't Tread on Me."
The flag-waving residents want to stop a park they fear will bring thousands of people walking along their streets every weekend. 
 On the waterfront below Brooklyn Heights, a state-sponsored local development corporation has proposed building a 70-acre $150 million park with green lawns, recreation areas, marshlands, an amphitheater, a hotel and restaurants from Atlantic Avenue to Jay Street.
New York City has pledged $64 million to build the park if the state will pay the rest. Now Gov. George E. Pataki and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns a majority of the proposed parkland, must decide whether to support the project and allow an environmental impact study of the site to go forward.
While Mr. Pataki weighs whether to support the park, the debate in Brooklyn Heights has taken on an increasingly bitter tone. Opponents fear that the park will attract hordes of people from outside the neighborhood to the narrow streets of well-preserved brownstones. They have accused supporters, their own neighbors, of putting the character, peace and property values of Brooklyn Heights in jeopardy.
In response, some park supporters have argued that concern over traffic, quality of life, crime and litter are code words that betray a fear of blacks and Hispanics from poorer sections of the borough. And that perpetuates Brooklyn Heights' elitist reputation, they have said.
Karen Sebiri, who lives in a 160-year-old home on Joralemon Street, flies a red and white "Don't Tread on Me" flag and believes a park will ruin the Heights. "This is a small neighborhood with a significant traffic problem," she said. "It can't support an influx of people. A park will make traffic impossible and it will raise crime rates."
Jim Rios, 48, lives on Columbia Place, a block away from Ms. Sebiri, who says she is in her 40's. There are no nearby ball fields, so each afternoon Mr. Rios plays whiffle ball in the street with 20 boys from the Heights and nearby neighborhoods. The opposition to the park by Ms. Sebiri and other neighbors angers him. He fears, he said, that his neighbors are turning their backs on a needed amenity because they want to isolate themselves from poor parts of Brooklyn. "They want to live in their own little world," he said. "They want a suburb in the city, and that is ridiculous."
The plan, created by the Brooklyn Bridge Park Development Corporation, would use tax money to build grassy lawns and recreation centers on the waterfront. It would use rents from commercial tenants like a hotel and restaurants to pay for maintenance and security.
Since park budgets have been cut sharply in the last decade, public officials have said the park should not require a continuing subsidy by taxpayers. The borough president, Howard Golden, who founded the development corporation, has said commercial development would increase park use, improve waterfront safety and create economic growth.
Development corporation officials say that once the governor gives his approval, construction can begin on the part of the park between the Brooklyn and Manhattan Bridges. The southern part of the park, on what is now Port Authority land, could take years to build, because an environmental study still has to be conducted (and debated).
The plan has the support of many in the area, including the Brooklyn Heights Association, a neighborhood group. Park boosters do not understand how people could oppose building a park on a fallow strip of land with such extraordinary views, especially when the alternative could be luxury housing or a mall.
Last month, Babette Krolik, a Heights resident, stood on the deck of a boat chartered to view the site of the proposed park. As the sun fell toward New Jersey, it pushed the Manhattan skyline into silhouette, poured an orange light over the Brooklyn Bridge anchorage and drew a sigh from Ms. Krolik. "If you need any other argument for a park," she said, "look at this sunset."
The Brooklyn Bridge park is not the first waterfront esplanade with spectacular views to face opposition in the city in recent years. Some West Village residents opposed the creation of the Hudson River Park because they feared that the project would be too commercial and draw too many people to already crowded streets. Although ultimately unsuccessful in Manhattan, those arguments are now echoed in Brooklyn.
Residents skeptical of the Brooklyn park plan say they believe that government and private foundations, not commercial ventures, ought to pay to keep up the park. "This is a citizens' protest against what we perceive as a huge real estate deal," said Catherine M. Fitzsimons, who hung the first "Don't Tread on Me" flag along Joralemon Street on May 1. "I don't call something with a huge hotel, conference center and restaurants a park."
Although park plan opponents can be found all over the Heights, the organized opposition is centered on cobblestone blocks at the western end of Joralemon Street. Under the current plan, the most direct path from the downtown Brooklyn subway lines to the park would be to walk down Joralemon, a narrow residential street lined with twisting old trees, overflowing flower boxes and brownstones worth up to $3 million.
Some opponents of the plan have said they would support a park if it had no commercial development and less active recreation facilities, thereby attracting fewer visitors. Others want an iron gate to seal Joralemon off from the waterfront. Still others, like Ms. Sebiri, do not want any sort of park.
Ms. Sebiri said the marsh would lure mosquitoes and the amphitheater would bring Britney Spears and rambunctious fans. She wants neither more insects nor more teenagers. Six months after the park opens, she predicted, the buildings will be covered with graffiti, rowdy young people will plague the neighborhood and there will be muggings up and down the street.
"I don't see this as the eighth wonder of the world," she said.
Many opponents say that the park will make every day in Brooklyn Heights like Independence Day. On the Fourth of July, the Brooklyn Heights Promenade, which overlooks the harbor, is packed with visitors, many of whom are black.
Frank Folisi, a Heights resident who lives near Monroe Place and Clark Street, complained that he would not even hang an American flag on July 4 without its being stolen. Mr. Folisi said the park would attract too many young people to the recreation and activity centers.
"The quality-of-life crimes are committed by young people," he said. "I'd rather see a Costco or a Target down there than see this neighborhood overwhelmed by people who come from someplace else."
But park supporters cringe when they hear such arguments. Brooklyn Heights is mostly white and wealthy. Supporters believe that opponents are using a code that means black and Hispanic teenagers from poor areas of Brooklyn. "What you have to realize is that a lot of people in Brooklyn Heights are afraid of people from other parts of Brooklyn coming to the neighborhood," Ms. Krolik said.
Development corporation board members have long worried about reaction to the park plan in the Heights. Although political leaders will commit the millions needed to build a park only if it is designed to serve all of Brooklyn, planners say they know the Heights has the political muscle to kill the plan. From last winter until this spring, planners held a series of public workshops to build support for the park. The workshops converted many skeptics, but opposition remains.
Hazel Fershleiser, a Heights resident and a supporter of the plan, compared the opposition to the contention over a 12-screen movie theater that opened at the edge of the neighborhood last month. Both projects, Mrs. Fershleiser said, have created fears that black residents would come to the Heights.
"To some extent it's been isolated, and the fact it's not as isolated anymore concerns people," she said.
Most opponents of the park bristle at suggestions that they fear people from other parts of Brooklyn. Pearl Bowser, a Joralemon Street resident for 50 years, an opponent of the current plan and an African-American, said park boosters were using labels like xenophobia and elitism to smear the opponents and minimize their concerns. Ms. Bowser supports a park, but one without commercial development. "No one in this community objects to the variety of the people coming to the waterfront," she said. "We object to the volume of traffic coming through. It's not a park. It's a hotel and convention center with a lawn."
But not all the residents reject the elitist label. They ask: What is wrong with trying to preserve the peacefulness and community spirit of a neighborhood? "People want to isolate their community, but that is normal," Ms. Sebiri said. "To call it elitism is too easy. Everyone wants his or her neighborhood isolated. What makes a neighborhood? Having a small community where people know each other."
Allowing thousands of people to come to the Brooklyn waterfront every weekend through a residential area will destroy homeowners' ability to keep an eye on their property and maintain the beauty of their streets, Ms. Sebiri said.
"I don't think Brooklyn Heights asked for this," she said. "If you are really thinking of the less fortunate, you would want to help put parks in their neighborhoods."
Joralemon Street residents said their fight against the park proposal had created a new neighborhood solidarity that could be seen in all the houses participating in the Greenest Block contest.
For two years the part of Joralemon Street lined with cobblestones has finished second in the contest to a block on State Street in Boerum Hill. Earlier this year there were hopes of a victory for Joralemon, thanks to a fund-raiser and a $900 investment in cascading geraniums and oak-leaf hydrangeas.
But the contest is run by Mr. Golden, the borough president, who has pledged $7 million to build the park that many on Joralemon hate.
"Now forget it," Ms. Fitzsimons said. "Howie Golden's never going to pick this block."

HEADLINE: WHAT'S NEXT;
In Online Auctions of the Future, It'll Be Bot vs. Bot vs. Bot

BYLINE: By ANNE EISENBERG 

 BODY:
THEY are called shopbots, buybots, pricebots or just plain bots -- the "bot" is short for robot. The name is playful, but the reality is all business because shopbots are meant to roam the Web all by themselves one day, efficiently buying and selling goods and services for people and companies.
An infinite number of shopbots, each a piece of software, are expected to show up as electronic commerce expands. One of the more conservative estimates is that there will be hundreds of millions of them. 
 They will resemble today's relatively simple consumer shopbots, personalized computer programs that bid on buyers' behalf at auctions or go out on the Web to find the best prices on jeans, but they will be far smarter and faster.
These autonomous agents, as they are known among the people who create them, will be written to handle dozens of auctions rather than just one, bidding simultaneously and juggling results not just for the best buy for a single product, like paper, for instance, but for several related goods -- like a combination of paper, ink, binders and printing press time.
And the bots will do this in a way humans cannot, responding to slight changes in prices in a fraction of a second.
As a result, many in the field predict that ordinary people and businesses will have the wherewithal to handle the complexities of automated trading in an infinite combination of market situations, like arranging vacations, assembling portfolios or setting manufacturing schedules.
Once unleashed, automated trading bots will probably cause many changes in the business-to-business and consumer marketplaces.
"We have a research program to ask how the world will look when hundreds of billions of agents are running around," said Dr. Steve R. White, a manager who directs research into such decentralized software systems at I.B.M.'s Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, N.Y. "We want to help I.B.M. get there first with software -- economic agents that can make pricing and buying decisions for a business."
People in both research and business are thinking about the economics of shopbots, writing software that will let the bots learn from their mistakes and successes and trying to anticipate what Web business will be like when shopbots are crawling all over the sites.
Among them is Dr. Michael Wellman, an automated-trading expert who is a professor of computer science and engineering at the University of Michigan. One of his approaches is more playful than most.
Dr. Wellman decided that a game was a good way to encourage researchers to focus on the problems of shopbots and to share what they have learned, an unusual step in the often proprietary world of autonomous agents.
So he and a colleague, Dr. Peter R. Wurman, a computer science professor at North Carolina State University, organized a competition for shopbots. The event was held last month at a conference in Boston.
"Other scientists have competitions," Dr. Wellman said. "Why not us? This is the first competition of a complex trading scenario with autonomous agents that we know of."
He and his colleagues set up trials involving that purgatory familiar to any summer traveler: a plane trip. Competing software programs would have to arrange round-trip airline tickets to Boston along with hotel accommodations and entertainment: a Red Sox game, a Boston Symphony concert or a performance of "Phantom of the Opera." And the shopbots had to find all of that at the best rates for the entire package -- all deals were off, for example, if the airline tickets were a bargain but all the hotel rooms were already booked.
Twenty teams of researchers from six countries participated, trying to have their sophisticated programs outwit their competitors' bots to line up the best trip.
It was no simple matter because there were separate auctions for all of the hotel and airline reservations, complete with tricky rules that affected prices. Pitfalls abounded. Only a limited number of hotel rooms were available, for example, so a program that could not handle the hotel auctions might leave its client without a place to sleep.
The winner was a team from AT&T Labs in Florham Park, N.J. The team's leader, Dr. Peter Stone, a senior technical staff member, attributed the victory to a very flexible agent programmed to adapt itself to different circumstances. "We both increased the sophistication of our agent and imbued it with the ability to adapt itself," Dr. Stone said.
It also turned out to be important to have the bots avoid a pitfall familiar to many players of the stock market: irrational exuberance.
"The agents tended to get unruly," said Dr. Michael Kearns, head of the artificial intelligence department at AT&T and a member of the winning AT&T team. They tended to raise their offers for what they would pay based on what their competitors were doing rather than on the value of what was being sold -- just as humans often do, he added. "We are all used to markets running amok not because of the commodity, but because of the participants," Dr. Kearns said. "One of the dangers is that the same thing will happen in digital form."
There are other problems predicted when shopbots are unleashed, and some involve privacy. It will be easy enough to waylay shopbots on the Internet to find out, for instance, exactly what a buyer was willing to spend.
"Certainly if a program is trading on my behalf," said Dr. Yoav Shoham, a professor at Stanford University and an expert in complex online auctions, "and I send it on the network, someone can intercept the program and read my instructions, and that gives away a lot." Dr. Shoham said those instructions could be encoded to deal effectively with that security issue.
A number of companies sponsored the shopbot competition in Boston, among them International Business Machines and Andersen Consulting. Doug Bryan, a technology researcher at Andersen in Northbrook, Ill., said that bots would soon start appearing in numbers on the marketplace so the marketplace needed to get ready.
"The challenge to our customers -- we tend to represent big sellers -- is to know what the bots can do," he said. Right now, bots that simply go out and fetch price lists from the Web do not make intelligent decisions about matching a buyer's needs with a combination of offerings.
"That will change," Mr. Bryan said. "And businesses need to be prepared."
Dr. Stone, at AT&T Labs, has already noticed one effect bots can have on price-conscious consumers. If people become angry at travel agents who buy seats at what turn out to be prices that are too high, consider their antagonism when a computer program makes that kind of mistake.
"Buyers tend to get more upset when it is software that makes the decision, rather than a person,"' Dr. Stone said. "It's the usual Luddite instinct."

HEADLINE: CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK;
Tibor Kalman: Seeing, Disbelieving

BYLINE: By HERBERT MUSCHAMP 

 BODY:
SINCE Tibor Kalman was a friend of mine, I'm not able to write an objective review of "Tiborocity: Design and Un design by Tibor Kalman," the New Museum of Contemporary Art's lively retrospective of the late graphic designer's work. But I'd feel idiotic if I didn't write a personal story before the show comes down, this weekend.
"Tiborocity" had me shadowboxing with my friend, who died last year, over some of the issues we used to argue about. What is sensibility? What is visual culture? How do you maintain, or even measure integrity in the consumer society? Those are a few of the issues we didn't exhaust in Tibor's lifetime. Continuing the conversation is my way of remembering him. 
 Tibor was an artist of the distribution system -- the economic framework that bridges the gap between production and consumption. His metier encompassed art direction, graphic and product design, corporate branding and exhibition display. M&Co, his New York studio, achieved high visibility with designs for Artforum and Interview magazines; CD covers for Talking Heads and Laurie Anderson; brochures for Red Square, an East Village apartment building; and perhaps most memorably, a line of Surrealistic watches and clocks. The tone throughout was satirical, a lightly mocking wit deployed against design, against the consumer, against the trendiness embodied by M&Co and its clients.
Since we live in an era dominated by distribution, Tibor's work was intrinsically provocative, for how can art exist within it? Art, even Andy Warhol's, deals with truth, with the difference between life as it is and as we would like it to be. Distribution techniques -- advertising, graphic design, commercial photography, public relations, store display -- traffic in distortion and the exploitation of hope. That pill is not going to help you lose weight. You know this perfectly well. So does the manufacturer. The principal function of the distribution system is to loosen our mutual grip on reality.
Tibor and I both started out as window dressers. His windows (for the company that evolved into Barnes & Noble) featured books. Mine (for a shop called Design Research) showcased classic modern design. Our later paths led us toward the reverse of our respective displays. But the opposites remained conjoined. I write about the world of visual appearances. Tibor's designs often featured words.
A conflict between word and image initially brought us together. In 1985, Tibor was hired as the art director for Artforum magazine. I wrote the magazine's architecture column. The magazine already had a reputation for creating great layouts at the expense of writing. Tibor pushed this to an extreme. For his first issue, he had the notion of isolating random letters throughout the text and printing them in light blue instead of black. In my column, the letter "e" was chosen for this transformation. Since it made the text nearly unreadable, I naturally saw his fiddling as a sign of disrespect.
In hindsight, I can see that he was giving tit for tat. Oscar Wilde said, "The primary aim of the critic is to see the object as in itself it really is not." Why shouldn't design return the favor? Why not art-direct a poor critic's column out of recognition?
Like others who started out in the late 1960's, Tibor had a complicated relationship to authority. The counterculture, which many baby boomers saw as a bright beginning, came to a messy end. The last gasp of 19th-century Romanticism, it marked the dissipation of Romantic attitudes from a cultural elite to every adolescent's natural rite of passage. Rebellion became generic.
For some, the new media and information industries represented the rebirth of countercultural thinking in mainstream form. You really do have to Think Different to navigate the Web. You can create an entire worldview from a laptop. Point of view, sensibility, radiance can be transmitted worldwide. Tibor mainly worked in traditional media. As he was essentially a graphic designer, most of his output consisted of magazines, record and CD covers and print and TV ads, with the occasional foray into product design and even urban design. Still, he was a McLuhan child, a global villager who regarded media as a consciousness-raising device and advocated liberation from the linear authority of print culture.
The show suggests that Tibor's medium was as much tactile as visual. He traded in textures of thought: shapes, colors, stylistic periods, atmospheres rubbing one another like subway riders. Think of his umbrella lined with a blue sky, a Magritte pret-a-porter, the Surrealist icon made democratic and practical.
The closest I ever came to having a maiden auntie to send me a Christmas fruitcake each year was the holiday gift that arrived annually from Tibor's company. These tended to have socially uplifting themes. One year it would be a medicine cabinet in the shape of a red cross. Another year it would be a secondhand book stuffed with paper money. Included were envelopes, pre addressed to charities. (I spent the dough on myself.)
I took professional interest in Tibor's work for the 42nd Street Redevelopment Authority. Along with Robert A. M. Stern, Tibor was instrumental in creating the so-called interim plan, a set of guidelines governing the look of storefronts, signage and other elements in the rebuilding of Times Square. Besides contributing ideas, Tibor designed an immense sidewalk installation for the south side of 42nd Street on the short block between Broadway and Seventh Avenue.
Titled "Everybody," the project, designed with Scott Stowell, crystallized Tibor's aspirations for the revamped Crossroads of the World: socially inclusive, focused on the street, Surrealist in spirit. The major element was a large billboard, mounted just above sidewalk level. The word "Everybody" was spelled out in black letters against a background of school-bus yellow. Attached to the billboard was a small assortment of funky chairs. These could be reached by climbing a set of ziggurat-shaped bleachers. When seated, you gazed out on the Midtown circus with your feet dangling in air.
The project revolved, if just intuitively, around Surrealism's two intellectual poles: Freudian dream space (the slight elevation above street level evokes the loss of gravity, the low-altitude flight of dreaming hysterics), and Marxian social justice (the place serves the people, not the other way around). The school-bus yellow was itself a major component of the sign: Tibor's was largely an educational sensibility. He loved to absorb and to share.
All these things come across very clearly throughout the New Museum exhibition. It displays the range of artifacts Tibor collected, and his designs expressed the fusion of his references. Generosity and humility, more than political consciousness, were the transforming agents in his creative process. Perhaps the capacity to learn in public is the active ingredient in the creative sensibility.
The worst betrayal anyone can commit in my eyes is to move to Italy and leave me behind. So I was not disposed to forgive Tibor for accepting an offer to go to Rome as the editor of Colors, an advertorial magazine put out by Benetton, the clothing manufacturer. Nor was I inclined to like the magazine. I've never liked Benetton's clothes.
But I could see how frustrating it was for Tibor to design a magazine without exercising creative control over it. And I could also see the appeal of this particular magazine. There aren't many publications out there that draw a firm line between advertising and editorial. So it was disarming to come upon a magazine that was entirely upfront about being an ad. Still, Colors was an ad. It skewed the contract between the editor and the audience.
I confess that in my memory the magazine is largely a blur. Only a few images stand out from it, like those depicting Queen Elizabeth II as a dark-skinned, tropical monarch and Spike Lee as white-skinned suburban hip-hop devotee.
Tibor's magazine led him deeper and deeper into his own contradictions. That is what was so great about it. Unfortunately, it didn't give him space or time to work them out. These conflicts stemmed from the same problem: visual culture is a contradiction in terms.
Visual literacy once seemed like a liberating concept -- a release from the musty weight of history, books, linear thinking and the print tradition that McLuhan had consigned to history's dustbin. Images, and the prospect of communicating through images alone, offered the hope of changing consciousness. It was a logical repository for the counterculture's universalist ideals.
By the mid-1980's, however, it had become clear that these ambitions could not be attained by instinct alone. A more analytic, historically informed approach was needed to prevent visual culture from degenerating into a cult of ignorance and commercial manipulation. One afternoon, when Tibor and I were wandering through the splendors of Baroque Rome, I wondered whether he and I were seeing the same thing. Here was the most extravagant display of visual culture staged by Western civilization. Did Tibor get the Baroque message? All was possible, all could be questioned, provided that you accepted the absolute authority of the church. Sculptures, fountains, urban vistas, murals, buildings -- the most sumptuous entertainments would be provided for those who surrendered their souls to the Father.
In Tibor's magazine, every social injustice could be exposed, every authority mocked -- provided you flew the United Colors of Benetton. Every image was permissible, every pictorial juxtaposition would be laid out, provided you saluted the flag of visual culture. Which I did not. It had become the banner of the consumer society, a system as authoritarian as that of 17th-century Rome.
A few days after seeing the show, I was talking with Tod Williams, 31, director of the critically acclaimed movie "The Adventures of Sebastian Cole." He told me, "For my generation, images are garbage."
I had to laugh. What made the comment so devastating is that proponents of visual culture were always playing the generation card. They exploited adolescent illiteracy for self-serving ends. The notion of visual culture justified their own lack of cultivation (why read?) while giving them a sense of moral purpose (as teachers of visual literacy). In one breath, they announced: "The future belongs to the imagists, and . . . let's do it for the kids."
These two dubious messages provided the slim intellectual content of Colors No. 13, the last issue Tibor edited before returning to New York. This provocative number contained pages of pictures and one page of text. These were agreeably laid out. A nice album of pix. A style book of personal adornment (tattoos, makeup, eyeglass frames); of erotic and violent encounters (mating carrots, a car crash). Rows of toes next to rows of noses. Blood. Variety meats. Surgery. At the end, a confused editorial argued that the editors didn't really think that pictures were more truthful, but somehow they were. Words to that effect. Then a suggestion that if you've wasted time reading the editorial you owe it to yourself to go back and stare at a picture for the same length of time, etc.
After my conversation with Tod Williams, I thought, yes, issue No. 13 was basically a load of garbage. The editorial was trashy, too. It said: "Look at my garbage. Don't like what you see? Look again. Harder." And it was generational garbage. A baby boomer was saying to his younger audience: "Here, take our priceless garbage. We give it to you -- the leaders of the 21st century. Yours to cherish. Yours to adore."
Actually, I don't think that images are garbage. I doubt very much that a filmmaker like Tod Williams does, either. People like us must be scopophiliacs to do what we do. But visual culture per se is not a visual phenomenon. It has barely a glancing relationship to aesthetics in any form. Rather, it is a social, psychological, political and, above all, an economic manifestation. To be visually literate, in any but the most superficial consumerist fashion, you have to tear aside the screen of images and locate the nonvisual factors that are running the show.
My hunch is that, if Tibor's life hadn't been cut short, he would have done just that. He would have had a commercially successful way to educate people about the many facets of visuality. We would all be hooked on Tibor.com, where we would find combined access to the most extraordinary array of images and the most dazzling written insights into the visual apparatus. We would have Avedon's "Dovima With Elephants" along with commentaries on it by Arthur Danto and Janet Malcolm. We could download entire libraries of the greats illustrated with before-and-after pictures of cosmetic makeovers. Tibor would return to showcasing books, in other words, much as the window of this page is dressed with his designs.

HEADLINE: U.S., Fearing Swine Fever in Britain, Bans Imports

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: LONDON, Aug. 16

 BODY:
The United States ordered a temporary ban on swine imports from Britain today, joining several European countries that acted after the discovery of swine fever in the country.
The episode has evoked memories of Britain's battle with mad cow disease, and rattled Britain's livestock traders once again. 
 "People are at their wits' end," said James Black, vice chairman of the National Pig Association, an industry group whose mood had just begun to recover after a two-year slump in prices.
Swine fever is highly contagious but is not considered a threat to humans.
The bans on British shipments of live pigs, pig semen and other products follow the discovery of swine fever on farms in the East Anglia region of southeast England. The outbreak is the first for 14 years.
Swine fever is usually controlled only by the destruction of infected animals. Thousands of animals have already been slaughtered.
Unlike mad cow disease -- bovine spongiform encephalopathy -- it is not thought to threaten humans. Mad cow disease has been linked in Britain to a similar ailment in humans, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, that has claimed around 50 victims in this country and caused huge economic losses in British agriculture.
Hallie Pickhardt, a spokeswoman for the United States Agriculture Department, said the department had "placed a hold" on all swine imports from Britain. She said that American officials were working closely with their British counterparts to assess the extent of the problem.
Last year, the United States imported just $11 million worth of British pork poducts, a tiny amount of its total pork imports.
On Monday, the European Union, of which Britain is a member, banned the importation of live pigs and porcine semen from England to prevent swine fever from spreading to European herds, some of which were decimated by outbreaks of the disease in the Netherlands and Germany between 1997 and 1998. Like the United States, Spain went further and outlawed imports of pig meat.
British officials are trying to persuade European officials in Brussels to limit the ban to live pigs from the East Anglia region.
For many Britons, the ban has recalled the three-year duel between Britain and the European Union over exports of British beef, which was imposed in 1996 and finally lifted one year ago, except in France. The beef ban stirred deep resentments among those Britons opposed to what they saw as a meddlesome and hostile European bureaucracy in Brussels.
The pig ban threatened to widen today. A big supermarket chain, ASDA, which is owned by Wal-Mart Stores Inc., has threatened to take Belgian pate off its shelves in response to the European action. An ASDA spokeswoman called the threat "a symbolic gesture."

Cruise Ships Descend On Newfound Bonanza

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: ST. JOHN'S, Newfoundland

 BODY:
In the workaday harbor here, normally plied by tugs, tankers and freighters laid up for repairs, Le Levant offered a startling contrast on a recent day: a sleek French cruise ship disgorging 50 affluent American tourists.
To welcome the first visitors of Newfoundland's late-summer cruise season, two young women in redcoat colonial uniforms played flutes on the quay, and Sailor, a huge Newfoundland dog, wagged his tail enthusiastically. 
 Here on Canada's easternmost island, the scheduled arrival of 15 tourist ships this season is part of a larger psychological and economic turnaround for a province often compared to Ireland, the ancestral home of many of its 540,000 residents.
For years, Newfoundland has been Canada's poorest province, a steady exporter of brain and brawn and a heavy importer of financial aid from Ottawa. But echoing Ireland's recent experience, Newfoundland recorded Canada's highest growth rate last year, 5.3 percent.
Oil revenues are eating away at Newfoundland's need for federal aid; a thriving crab and lobster fishing industry is replacing the 500-year experience with cod; and Newfoundland, with its coves and quiet, is becoming a magnet for tourists. After stagnating for a decade, tourism jumped by 50 percent over the last four years.
The 1990's were the boom years for cruise ships in the Pacific waters of British Columbia and Alaska. In the new decade, Americans are discovering cruising Atlantic Canada, from Nova Scotia to Newfoundland to Labrador, and north into the eastern Arctic.
This summer, 150,000 people, almost all Americans, are expected to take cruises into Canada's eastern provinces, a sevenfold increase since 1995. Halifax, Nova Scotia, the region's most popular port of call, has reservations this season for 102 ships, double the number in 1998. In Montreal, the number of passengers disembarking at docks of the Old Port neighborhood is expected to hit 38,000 this summer, double last year's level. Most of the Atlantic Canada cruises start in Boston and New York.
On Canada's Pacific coast, British Columbia expects three times as many cruise passengers as in Atlantic Canada. But if present trends continue, by the end of this decade cruise traffic on the two coasts will be roughly even, with one million cruise ship passengers each summer turning Canadian waters into the Caribbean of the north.
Worldwide, to capture future waves of retiring baby boomers, cruise ship companies anticipate growth and have ordered 60 new ships, worth $24 billion.
"This means the cruise industry is going to be looking for new destinations," said Gordon Slade, chief executive of the Cruiseship Authority of Newfoundland and Labrador, a new public-private entity here.
"Our niche is really the adventure cruising," he said. "We offer what Alaska offers -- whales, seabirds and fjords. But we also have what Alaska doesn't have -- the moving ice, icebergs."
Mr. Slade was down at the quay here to greet the French ship, which had steamed from St. Pierre and Miquelon, two French islands off the southwest coast of Newfoundland.
Jan E. Robinson, a 45-year-old federal worker from Los Angeles, greeted Sailor, the dog, and set off for sightseeing on Water Street, which the city claims to be the oldest street in North America. On her return, she pronounced St. John's, which dates to the mid-1500's, "a beautiful city -- if I could figure out how to come back, I would do it."
Robert W. Burgess, a 68-year-old retired manufacturer from Massachusetts who was traveling with his wife, Nancy, was blunt about why they were here. After 12 cruises, he said, "we're running out of places to go."
Last year, 1.1 million American tourists visited Atlantic Canada, a record number that undoubtedly was lifted higher by the lure of the weak Canadian dollar.
"The Americans are pretty free with their money," said Ernest Gosse, a taxi driver who makes a point of circling by Harbour Avenue when a cruise ship is in port. "Last summer, I had one lady who bought a little dory boat, a couple of sweaters for her grandkids and two replicas of Viking ships."
Spurring North American interest in the Rock, as Newfoundlanders affectionately call their island, are a number of recent novels, most notably "The Shipping News" (Touchstone/Simon & Schuster), a novel by E. Annie Proulx that won a Pulitzer Prize in 1994.
"Newfoundland is not well known -- this puts us out there," Mr. Slade, the cruise ship promoter, said of the book. "More people read it outside the province than inside the province. First person I talked to who had read the book was from Texas."
For the cruise industry really to take off, St. John's, a metropolitan area of 150,000 people, needs a way for people to fly from Europe and the United States and then to take the cruise ships one way.
Canadians have been demanding an end to laws that restrict flights between Canadian cities to Canadian airlines. An end to such restrictions would clear the way for international flights to stop here.
"Canada should consider real airline competition," Brian Tobin, premier of Newfoundland and Labrador, said in an interview. "We are not prepared to be quaint little Newfoundland, shrouded in the mists of time, so Air Canada can be a monopoly for the next 50 years."

Defining Al Gore

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
Al Gore has two big problems Bill Clinton and Al Gore.
He may be able to finesse one of them -- Mr. Clinton. But the other he will have to face head-on. 
 "People still don't feel they really know Al Gore, and that's hurting him," said a Democratic delegate, her face a study in disappointment. "They think they know Clinton but Gore comes off as inauthentic. Only he can change that."
If you look at the state of the nation, nearly everything is going the vice president's way. The U.S. is enjoying the best economy in its history. The country is at peace. Crime and unemployment are way down, as are the welfare rolls and rates of teen pregnancy. The stock market has soared and so has home ownership.
Never before has the American dream been the reality for so many.
Moreover, most voters appear to agree with Mr. Gore on most of the big issues in this year's election, largely supporting his approach on such matters as health care, Social Security, taxes and the way to handle the federal budget surplus.
Polls have shown that a majority of voters also believe Mr. Gore is better prepared to be president than George W. Bush in terms of his intellectual capacity, command of the issues and experience.
And yet the vice president has trailed Mr. Bush in poll after poll, sometimes by wide margins. And the lack of enthusiasm for Mr. Gore from groups that traditionally are among the Democrats' strongest supporters, notably blacks and labor unions, is both palpable and potentially devastating.
Bill Clinton is a problem because the Gore folks both need him and wish he would go away. The vice president would like to bask in the sunshine of Mr. Clinton's accomplishments, even as he worries about getting lost in the president's shadow. He also worries about the dangers of Clinton fatigue.
But the bigger, tougher problem is Al Gore himself. Interviews this week with staunch Democrats who are fervent in their desire to see him become president have shown a deep concern that Mr. Gore's strengths when it comes to issues and experience may be trumped by the widespread perception that Mr. Bush is more likable.
The feeling generally was that Mr. Gore's public persona and communications skills had not markedly improved over the course of the campaign. There was a hunger among most of the people I talked with for the vice president to become less guarded and more spontaneous in his public appearances.
Robert Kayyem, a Los Angeles venture capitalist, was one of about 1,400 people who attended a Clinton fund-raiser over the weekend. When Mr. Clinton spoke, he said, "the other 1,399 people disappeared and it was as if the president had put his hands on my shoulders and was talking directly to me. Too often, Gore is just giving you boilerplate. He needs to speak with a certain genuineness of tone, which has been lacking. And I think he has to take some risks with his viewpoints and opinions."
Loren Rothschild, the owner of an investment fund and a supporter of Mr. Gore, agreed that the vice president's personality was problematic. But he remained optimistic. "Not everyone can be Bill Clinton or Franklin Roosevelt or John Kennedy," he said. "But it seems to me the Democrats have the issues -- on choice, on gun control, on the economy. And I think when people look at those issues they'll vote for the Democrats."
Tonight's the night for Mr. Gore. With much of the nation watching -- both critically and expectantly -- he will give his acceptance speech. It may not be fair to compare him to Mr. Clinton, who was blessed with extraordinary political skills, or to suggest that it is not enough for Mr. Gore to be better prepared and better qualified than Mr. Bush. It was a Democrat, after all, John Kennedy, who liked to point out that life is not fair.
Leadership is as important as competence in a president. The American people must be convinced that Al Gore is capable of defining a vision for the country and then rallying the forces necessary to realize that vision. And after Bill Clinton, they especially need a president they know is being straight with them.
Al Gore should let it rip tonight. The real Al Gore. Because if a phony shows up at that podium, this election is over.

Treasuries Fall on Fear of Eventual Rate Rise

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Bond prices fell yesterday on concern that yields did not reflect expectations that the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates again later this year.
The yield on the most actively traded 10-year note has fallen about three-quarters of a percentage point over the last three months, while the two-year note is down more than half a percentage point. All Treasury note and bond yields are below the Fed's 6.5 percent target for overnight loans between banks, which means that investors who borrow to buy Treasuries pay more than they receive in yield. 
 The price of the 10-year note fell 8/32, to 99 13/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 5.83 percent from 5.80 percent on Tuesday. The 30-year bond fell 15/32, to 107 8/32. Its yield rose to 5.74 percent from 5.71 percent.
Treasury prices fell after the Labor Department said that its index of consumer prices rose 0.2 percent in July, slightly higher than expectations, after increasing 0.6 percent in June. While analysts said the number was not bad for bonds, it did not reduce speculation that the Fed might eventually raise rates for a fourth time this year.
The report "confirms inflation still needs to be watched carefully, but isn't out of control," said Joseph Balestrino, who helps invest $3.5 billion for Federated Investors in Pittsburgh.
Higher oil prices are pushing up inflation around the world. Crude oil trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange is up 15 percent this month alone and 48 percent over the last 12 months.
"Despite signs of a slowing in economic activity in the U.S., it is too early to feel relaxed on the inflation front given what is happening to oil prices," said Noriaki Ebisui, deputy general manager of the fixed-income portfolio investment division of Sakura Investment Management in Tokyo.
