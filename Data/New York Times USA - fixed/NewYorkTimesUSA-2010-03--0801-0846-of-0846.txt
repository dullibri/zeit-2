HEADLINE: In Afghan Trip, Obama Presses Karzai on Graft

BYLINE: By ALISSA J. RUBIN and HELENE COOPER; Alissa J. Rubin reported from Kabul, Afghanistan, and Helene Cooper from Washington.

 BODY:
KABUL, Afghanistan -- President Obama personally delivered pointed criticism to President Hamid Karzai in a face-to-face meeting on Sunday, flying here for an unannounced visit that reflected growing vexation with Mr. Karzai as America's military commitment to defeat the Taliban insurgency has deepened. 
 Mr. Obama's visit was shrouded in secrecy and lasted only a few hours, but included a boisterous pep rally with American troops. It was his first trip as president to the scene of an eight-year-old war he has stamped as his own.
 While Mr. Obama said ''the American people are encouraged by the progress that has been made,'' as he stood beside Mr. Karzai at the heavily fortified presidential palace, Mr. Obama also emphasized that work remained to be done on the governance issues that have frustrated American officials over the past year. ''We also want to continue to make progress on the civilian process,'' Mr. Obama said. He mentioned several areas, including anticorruption efforts and the rule of law. 
 The trip highlighted how far the administration believes the Afghan government has to go to make good on promises that Mr. Karzai has made on governance and even reintegration with certain reconcilable members of the Taliban insurgency.
 The language used by Mr. Obama and Mr. Karzai in their private discussions was not disclosed. But Gen. James L. Jones, the national security adviser, told reporters on Air Force One en route to Afghanistan that the administration wanted Mr. Karzai to ''understand that in his second term, there are certain things that have not been paid attention to, almost since Day 1.''
 General Jones said that the Afghan president ''needs to be seized with how important'' the issue of corruption, in particular, is for American officials. 
 The visit capped a high-profile week for Mr. Obama, in which he achieved a singular victory domestically -- signing health care legislation -- and reached an arms control agreement with Russia that calls for the two nuclear powers to slash their nuclear arsenals to the lowest levels in half a century. 
 Mr. Obama's visit to Afghanistan came against a backdrop of tension between Mr. Karzai and the Americans that has not substantially abated since Mr. Karzai was declared the winner of an election tainted by fraud. In the wake of last August's election, the United Nations and the United States, as well as other NATO countries, demanded that Mr. Karzai make major overhauls in the electoral system, tacitly indicating that they might withhold money for the next election if they did not see changes. 
 Mr. Karzai recently overhauled the Afghan election complaint commission, but made it less neutral by claiming the right to appoint all five members. Currently, three of the members are appointed by the United Nations. The move infuriated some Western diplomats here who saw it as almost a taunt. 
 Further aggravating tensions was a conference in London at the end of January at which corruption was a major topic and Western officials again made clear that they felt Mr. Karzai had fallen short. Recently, he has strengthened the anticorruption commission, and the attorney general appears to be moving forward on a handful of high-profile cases involving former government figures. Corruption remains pervasive, however, and Mr. Karzai has not used his position as a bully pulpit to change the culture. 
 ''He's slipping away from the West,'' said a senior European diplomat in Kabul. 
 Mr. Karzai warmly received one of America's most vocal adversaries, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran, on an official visit to Kabul in early March. Mr. Karzai met with him again this past weekend in Tehran, when the two celebrated the Afghan and Iranian New Year together. 
 Mr. Karzai returned to Kabul only hours before Mr. Obama landed.
 Last week, Mr. Karzai made a three-day trip to China, a country that is making economic investments in Afghanistan, notably in its copper reserves, taking advantage of the hard-won and expensive security efforts of the United States and other Western nations. 
 Air Force One landed at nighttime at Bagram Air Base after a 13-hour nonstop flight, for a visit kept secret for security reasons. Mr. Obama quickly boarded a helicopter for the trip to Kabul.
 White House officials did not give advance notice of the trip, and even went as far as to inform reporters that Mr. Obama would be spending the weekend at Camp David with his family. In fact, the president's trip occurred during the Afghan night, and he was flying back to Washington before most Afghans awakened Monday morning.
 Besides General Jones, Mr. Obama was accompanied by Rahm Emanuel, his chief of staff, and a number of other officials from the White House and the Defense Department.
 Mr. Obama also met with some of the tens of thousands of American troops who have been sent to Afghanistan since he took office. His visit with the troops was particularly significant because American combat casualties in Afghanistan have risen sharply while he has been commander in chief.
 In the first three months of 2010, at least 83 American service personnel have died in Afghanistan, versus 43 in the first three months of 2009, according to icasualties.org, a database of casualties in the Afghanistan and Iraq conflicts.
 The number of soldiers wounded in combat has also risen strikingly. Military officials have warned that casualties are likely to continue to rise sharply as the Pentagon completes the deployment of 30,000 additional soldiers, under the strategy that Mr. Obama announced in November. The reason for the spike, military officials said, is that American forces are aggressively seeking out Taliban insurgents in the country's population centers. A major operation is planned in Kandahar, the spiritual home of the Taliban, in the coming months.
 At Bagram Air Base, Mr. Obama told the cheering troops that he had no doubt they would be successful in their efforts to stop the Taliban from regaining power.
 ''Al Qaeda and their extremist allies are a threat to the people of Afghanistan and a threat to the people of America, but they're also a threat to people around the world,'' Mr. Obama said. ''My main job here today is to say thank you on behalf of the entire American people. You are part of the finest military in the history of the world. And we are proud of you.''
 The visit with American troops from their commander in chief was a long time coming. While Mr. Obama visited troops at Camp Victory in Iraq three months after he was inaugurated, the White House had put off a presidential trip to Afghanistan as Mr. Obama went through months of rigorous review of Afghanistan strategy, and as that country endured the twists and turns of the disputed election.
 Even after Mr. Karzai was inaugurated and Mr. Obama announced that he would send 30,000 more American troops, Mr. Obama still put off the visit as he focused on his domestic priorities, including a health care bill.
 Indeed, some members of the military have privately expressed concern that since announcing the Afghanistan troop increase, Mr. Obama has not talked much about the war there. 
 He appeared to be trying to address that on Sunday in his remarks with Mr. Karzai.
 ''One of the main reasons I'm here is to just say thank you for the incredible efforts of our troops and our coalition partners,'' he said. ''They make tremendous sacrifices far away from home, and I want to make sure they know how proud their commander in chief is of them.''

HEADLINE: Law May Do Little to Help Curb Unnecessary Care

BYLINE: By GINA KOLATA

 BODY:
Dr. Robert Colton, an internist in Boca Raton, Fla., has a problem, and he knows it. His patients come in wanting, sometimes demanding, tests and treatments that are unnecessary, just adding to the nation's huge health care bill. He even has patients, he says, who come in and report that their chief complaint is, ''I need an M.R.I.''
 And what does Dr. Colton do?
 ''I do the damn test,'' he said. ''There is no incentive for me, Rob Colton, to reduce overutilization. If the person wants it, what are you going to do, say no?'' 
 And the new health care legislation, he says, is not going to make a bit of difference. 
 To truly change the nation's chronic overuse of medical care, there will have to be a substantial change in the way patients think about health care, how medicine is practiced and how it is paid for, economists and doctors say. 
 The legislation does little to help in those areas. It is important, medical experts say, because it opens the door to medical care for millions of people who were shut out because they could not afford insurance or because they had pre-existing conditions or had reached lifetime caps on insurance payments. But controlling overuse is not its focus.
 Some, like Jonathan Gruber, a health economist at M.I.T., say change eventually has to come because the nation is on an unsustainable path. 
 ''Unless we are prepared to spend 50 percent of our G.D.P. on health care, it has to happen,'' Dr. Gruber said. 
 And at least the legislation takes a stab at the overuse problem, he said. For example, in a few years it will tax expensive health care plans. The idea is that if employers offer less expensive plans, with higher co-payments and deductibles, patients might demand less expensive care. Then there are the insurance exchanges that will compete for customers and might lower costs by refusing to pay for unnecessary tests and procedures.
 ''The relative comparison is not the perfect world,'' Dr. Gruber said. ''The relative comparison is the world without this bill.''
 But it will not be easy to put the brakes on overuse. Estimates of the amount of medical care that is unnecessary range from 10 to 30 percent, although no one knows for sure. Many doctors concede that they see overuse and that it has just become a part of the medical landscape. 
 Doctors often blame patients for demanding useless care, but many also concede that patients often have too little knowledge or power to say no to tests or treatments. The new law includes money for comparative effectiveness studies, and those can give guidance on which tests and treatments are better than others. But the law in no way forces patients or doctors to choose one test or treatment over another or to aim for the cheapest alternative. And it does nothing to change the reimbursement system, in which doctors often make more money if they order more tests, for instance. 
 In radiology, for example, there are clear guidelines, based on medical evidence, for CT scans of the head and neck. Among other things, the guidelines say CT scans are not necessary after most car accidents. Many patients have no real risk of brain injury from an accident, and there are good methods of deciding who is at risk and who is not. The guidelines have not put a dent in overuse. 
 The joke among radiologists, said Dr. Howard P. Forman, a radiologist and health services researcher at Yale, is that ''the indication for getting a head CT after a car accident is if you have a head.'' 
 The law includes pilot programs that Medicare is testing that pay doctors more for delivering better care at a lower cost. For example, groups of doctors can share in the savings to Medicare if they spend less money and improve the quality of their patients' care. 
 Such programs, linking medical outcomes and payments, might help if they were translated into Medicare policy, said Dr. Mark B. McClellan, the former leader of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, who is now at the Brookings Institution. But more should be done, Dr. McClellan said, considering the scope of the overuse problem. 
 ''It would be good to have more arrows in the quiver,'' he said.
 It is no surprise that Congress shied away from a serious effort to hold down overuse. The public has made it clear that it does not want to be told what medical care it can and cannot have. 
 ''The minute you attack overutilization you will be called a Nazi before the day is out,'' said Uwe E. Reinhardt, a health economist at Princeton. 
 Some hold out hope for the comparative effectiveness studies.
 But ''there is no direct link between the development of that evidence and the use of that evidence,'' said Bryan R. Luce, senior vice president for science policy at United Biosource Corp., a Washington consulting firm. 
 The idea of the comparative effectiveness guidelines is a sort of an ''if you build it, they will come'' notion, said Dr. J. Sanford Schwartz, a health economist and internist at the University of Pennsylvania. But that is not going to be sufficient, he said. There needs to be a way to effectively link what the guidelines say and how they are put into effect, how they are interpreted, what insurers pay for and what doctors do.
 One way to make those links is to do what some other countries do -- say that there will be no payments for care that is not deemed the most cost-effective. But politicians shy away from such measures, Dr. Luce said. ''That is not likely to happen soon, particularly at a national level,'' he said.
 It would mean rationing, said Dr. Robert D. Truog a professor of medical ethics, anesthesia, and pediatrics at Harvard Medical School. ''That's the word nobody wants to use. It's just a firecracker. Nobody wants to touch it.''
 The result is a crazy system in which, he points out, a government-appointed task force on screening mammography was explicitly forbidden to consider the costs of offering mammograms to women for whom the benefit is very small. 
 ''The point is that as long as a health care system has anything less than an infinite budget, there is a need to decide which types of health care will be funded and which will not,'' Dr. Truog said.
 But that does not seem to be in the offing. And some, like Dr. Schwartz, despair.
 ''Einstein once said, 'Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result,' '' Dr. Schwartz said.
 Meanwhile in Florida, Dr. Colton says, he and his doctor friends would welcome a way to stop overuse. They would, he said, embrace guidelines and a payment system that denies reimbursement for unnecessary medicine and protects doctors from malpractice suits if they follow the guidelines. 
 ''I really believe that in our heart of hearts most doctors want to curb this,'' Dr. Colton said. ''We know what we are doing. And we are frustrated, too. But we can't help ourselves. There is nothing to stop us and nothing to be gained by stopping.''

HEADLINE: Church Hires Hundreds, but Doubts Surround Project

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ; Alain Delaqueriere contributed reporting.

 BODY:
In December, the pastor of a fledgling storefront church in Red Hook, Brooklyn, began spreading word among several dozen evangelical Christian congregations that he was hiring employees for a huge new social service program. Hundreds of applicants packed meetings where, many people say, the pastor declared that he had a grant from World Vision, the international relief agency, to help the poor and spread the Gospel.
 Since then the pastor, the Rev. Isidro Bolanos, has told several hundred people that they have been hired. He has collected their Social Security numbers, their birth dates and other personal data. And after several delays, he has told them that the program will open on Wednesday, in 150,000 square feet he is renovating in Building 3 of the Brooklyn Army Terminal.
 But there is no Building 3. World Vision says it does not know of any such project. Nor do city officials or several heads of other faith-based programs. 
 Mr. Bolanos's plans have left some Latino evangelical leaders in New York -- and many of his new employees, who have yet to work or be paid -- bewildered and seeking answers about the grant money he says he has secured.
 ''I don't see how it could be possible,'' said the Rev. Raymond Rivera, chief executive of the Latino Pastoral Action Center in the Bronx, which struggles to meet its $3 million budget for its established youth and community programs. ''Even evangelical philanthropies want certain information from a church. They just don't give them money. They want to make sure there is an infrastructure. They want to make sure there is good stewardship.'' 
 Mr. Bolanos, pastor of the Christian Church of El Dios Vivo, has reassured employees that the enterprise, called Community Project, Brooklyn Pilot Program, is ready to send them into neighborhoods to provide services to families, young people, addicts and the elderly from offices at the Brooklyn Army Terminal.
 But David Lombino, a spokesman for the city's Economic Development Corporation, which oversees rentals at the terminal, said his agency had never heard of Mr. Bolanos, his project, his church or any benefactor. The city agency, he said, had to turn away 100 people who showed up this month to inspect their new, nonexistent office.
 Reached by phone on Thursday, Mr. Bolanos grew agitated when a reporter asked him about his group's financing and plans. He promised to grant an interview at some unspecified date. But when told that city officials had said they had not heard of him, he hung up.
 The spokesman for the project, the Rev. Carlos Torres, said there was nothing unusual about a small, recently formed church receiving a large grant. ''Man cannot comprehend what is of God,'' he said. ''God does what He wants, with whom He wants and how He wants.''
 Asked what the church was doing with the trove of personal data, Mr. Torres asked if the conversation was being recorded, then suggested meeting the reporter later that night. An hour later, he called to cancel the meeting, saying he was not authorized to speak.
 There is no sign outside Mr. Bolanos's church, in a former Knights of Columbus hall on Van Brunt Street, which last September received tax-exempt status as a religious organization. Neighbors said the congregation moved in last year, attracting only a handful of people to services until December, when throngs overflowed the tiny church. Word had gotten out among a circle of evangelical congregations that the church had a multimillion-dollar grant to hire for a community project. 
 Several applicants recently agreed to talk with a reporter -- and one shared an audio recording of Mr. Bolanos at a recent meeting -- on the condition that they not be identified, because they did not want to antagonize their own pastors or friends who remained in the program.
 ''When I went to the interview in Brooklyn, there were over 200 people in the place,'' one applicant said. ''I felt the people applying didn't seem to have much experience. And the project interviewers seemed disorganized.''
 She said she was hired on the spot for an administrative position, and filled out forms with her Social Security number and other personal information. Other people, she said, handed over copies of their Social Security cards or driver's licenses. Few specifics about the project were provided, she said. She and others, however, recall being told that World Vision was backing it.
 Another applicant hired in January said he had had doubts about the World Vision connection and called the relief group, which told him it had no Brooklyn project. He was later fired, he said, along with two friends who had asked to see the church's tax and other financial documents.
 ''I feel we were let go after we asked questions because we sort of interrupted something,'' the man said. ''The pastor and the other clergy got pretty upset.''
 World Vision received 20 calls from people worried about the project, said Dean Owen, a spokesman for the aid group. He said an official from World Vision's New York office had visited Mr. Bolanos, who denied ever invoking the group's name.
 But World Vision officials said the callers consistently reported that they had been told -- though never in writing -- that the group was supporting the project. Since February, World Vision has posted a disclaimer on its Web site saying it has no connection to any Brooklyn project.
 Mr. Bolanos, asked by a reporter about his claims of financing from World Vision, grew angry. ''World Vision is not the word of God,'' he said. ''I am not interested in what World Vision says.''
 People who have attended employee meetings say Mr. Bolanos now says that his benefactor is the American Holding Charities Group, and that its chief operating officer is Kristina Morris. A database search of charities and foundations nationwide turned up no mention of that group or a Kristina Morris.
 After the project's planned Jan. 1 start date passed without an opening, roughly 500 people hired from Brooklyn and Manhattan were invited to services and training sessions at several large churches in Williamsburg. At one, pastors gave rudimentary lessons in Christian counseling, telling those in attendance that professional counselors would train them further in March.
 At each service, participants said, the collection plate was passed. 
 ''If they supposedly had millions from Mrs. Morris, why did they take up a collection?'' one participant said. ''And if they had all this money, why did we have to bring the food?''
 This month, employees said, Mr. Bolanos told them that Mrs. Morris -- who he said was to hand each employee an envelope containing an employment contract, benefits package, MetroCard and uniform voucher -- had to travel to Israel to bury her mother. She had taken the keys to the office with her, employees said he told them.
 Despite the delays, Mr. Bolanos spent March 17 and 18 at Jehovah Shalom Pentecostal Church in the Bronx interviewing for 200 more jobs. Applicants needed a letter from their pastor to be admitted into the church, where security guards stood watch. Hundreds arrived in the early morning, waiting by a door where a hand-drawn sign read ''Interview Entrance Take a Number.''
 The Rev. Ray Talavera, the pastor of Glory of Christ Church, dropped by to look into the claims that jobs were being offered. He said he was stunned to see people packed into every part of the church, interviews taking place, and a service in full swing.
 ''In the middle of all this, they take a collection,'' he said. ''I found that disturbing. These are people coming to you for help and you take a collection? When I have a soup kitchen, I don't charge people anything.''
 The Rev. Ricardo Guzman, the pastor of Jehovah Shalom, said collections were customary at any service. But he declined to answer questions about the job interviews. ''I was here adoring God,'' he said.
 In recent weeks, Mr. Bolanos has warned employees that ''the enemy'' is trying to disrupt the program. In a tape recording of the March 18 meeting, he can be heard denouncing one employee as a ''son of Satan.'' Outsiders, even parents or spouses, have been barred from meetings, the pastor says on the tape.
 At that gathering, Mr. Bolanos counseled patience. 
 ''Listen to this well,'' he said. ''On March 31, we will give much thanks to God. You will get all your equipment, your package and be paid. And you will return on April 5 for the start.''

HEADLINE: Early Diagnoses Of the New Law

BYLINE: By THE NEW YORK TIMES

 BODY:
Love it or hate it, the health care overhaul is the most significant piece of domestic legislation to emerge from Washington in decades. The new law is also ferociously complex: the original Senate bill, which served as the blueprint for most of the changes, ran well over 2,000 pages. 
 So what is buried in those pages? Here are some thoughts from health care experts on what the changes will mean for Americans, sick and well alike. 
 Elizabeth A. McGlynn 
 Associate director of health programs, RAND Corporation.
 Can the health care system handle the demands of 30 million-plus new customers?
 It's estimated that more than half of the newly insured will be under age 35, and about 80 percent will be in good to excellent health. They will not be using services for the first time, but they may decide to change providers. More than one-third will enroll in Medicaid, and it's thought they will use fewer services than those with private insurance.
 Still, in the short run, the capacity of the system to meet demand will be strained, particularly in areas that currently have high rates of uninsurance.
 Consumers shouldn't be surprised to find a system in flux as we look for new ways to deliver health care. Patients might see a nurse practitioner instead of a doctor for routine problems; they might confer with their doctor over secure Web sites or their cellphones. We're likely to see health care delivered in ways we've never seen before.
 Brian D. Smedley
 Vice president and director, Health Policy Institute at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies.
 The dramatic passage of health care reform was a historic turning point in the effort to repair a deeply broken system. But by itself, the legislation will not be enough to address the needs of many people of color, who face higher rates of infant mortality, chronic disease and disability, and premature death than white Americans do.
 The new law will help expand insurance coverage and improve access to health care providers in underserved communities, among other benefits. But the major reasons for the persistence of racial and ethnic health inequalities are socioeconomic inequality and differences in neighborhood living conditions -- both of them fueled by residential segregation. These are the issues that policymakers must tackle if we are to improve opportunities for good health for all.
 Michael D. Tanner
 Senior fellow, Cato Institute.
 It's not just what the bill will do; it's also what it won't do.
 It won't do anything to lower premiums. Insurance premiums will roughly double over the next 6 to 10 years for people with group coverage through work, just as they would have without the legislation. For nearly 37 million people in the individual insurance market, the new minimum package of benefits means that they can expect to pay 10 to 13 percent more than they would have if the bill hadn't passed.
 About 57 percent of these workers will receive at least some subsidies to help offset the cost, but 43 percent will have to bear the full cost. True, they will receive more benefits, but it will not be by their choice.
 Henry J. Aaron
 Senior fellow, Brookings Institution.
 Everyone should recognize that there will be no parting of the heavens. Changes in a $2.6 trillion industry will not come quickly. For the immediate future, the number of uninsured will most likely keep on rising. Spending will keep increasing at excessive rates. The quality of care will not be instantly transformed.
 But a process of reform that will take a generation to unfold must begin now. And that requires a sustained effort by health reform supporters to explain to the public what is in the bill and to clear away misconceptions created by opponents.
 Consumers stand to gain enormously from efficient, well-designed health insurance exchanges. But state officials opposed to reform may well stall and create roadblocks. So supporters should mobilize now to see that as many states as possible move promptly to enact the laws necessary to create these exchanges.
 Gail Wilensky
 Administrator, Health Care Financing Administration, 1990-92.
 Many of the uninsured are going to be unpleasantly surprised that new insurance options for them remain years away -- 2014, to be precise.
 That's the year insurers will have to take all applicants regardless of pre-existing conditions. Everyone earning less than 133 percent of the poverty line ($14,404 for a single person) will be eligible for Medicaid. People who aren't offered employer-sponsored insurance whose income falls between 133 percent and 400 percent of the poverty line, and who aren't already on a public program, will be offered subsidies to choose among negotiated insurance plans through state-organized insurance exchanges.
 Some benefits, primarily for limited groups of individuals, will be available later this year: some young adults will be able to stay on their parents' plans, and people who have been deemed uninsurable will be able to buy insurance through subsidized high-risk pools. These are not trivial benefits, but they are not relevant to most of the uninsured.
 Unlike the benefits, much of the financing starts before 2014. Consumers will feel those effects directly and indirectly. Health insurance premiums are likely to rise, and many seniors who have been on Medicare Advantage plans are going to find their benefits cut or premiums raised, since almost 30 percent of the Medicare cuts come from reductions in payments to these plans. We'll have to see whether promises of more benefits in the future will outweigh the short-term pain.
 Timothy Stoltzfus Jost
 Professor, Washington and Lee University School of Law.
 Health care reform is now the law of the land. But most of the insurance reforms, including the consumer protections and exchanges, must be implemented by the states. The law asks states to adopt the federal standard or their own equivalent standards. The federal government will enforce the law's requirements or set up a health exchange only in states that choose not to do so.
 This is a real opportunity for the states, and in particular state insurance commissioners, to design approaches that fit their own situations. But there is also a threat to consumers if states adopt laws that do not measure up to the federal standards. It is unfortunate that a quarter of the states have started off on the wrong foot, challenging the law rather than working with it creatively to serve their own citizens' interests.
 Yvette Roubideaux, M.D.
 Director, Indian Health Service.
 The new health care law will expand the services we provide to American Indians and Alaskan Natives. For example, it authorizes us to provide hospice, assisted-living, long-term and home- and community-based care to these communities, often for the first time. It allows tribes and tribal organizations to buy coverage for their employees from the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. It will enable us to expand behavioral health programs for Indians.
 William H. Dow
 Associate professor, University of California, Berkeley.
 Expanding health insurance to 32 million more people will greatly strengthen our country's safety net. The reforms will also improve the health of many of those currently uninsured, addressing a national disgrace: the premature deaths of uninsured people who cannot get medical care.
 But inadequate health care accounts for just 10 percent of premature mortality. Even with these reforms, our populationwide health indicators will continue to trail those of other developed countries.
 Significant improvements in life expectancy will require turning our attention to underlying social determinants that lead people to fall ill in the first place. The next major social policyfight should concentrate on the single most important factor that research suggests will improve the health of the next generation: investing in the education of disadvantaged youth.
 Karen Davenport
 Director of health policy, Center for American Progress.
 One of the most important features of the new health care law is the requirement that almost everyone carry health insurance or pay a fine. This may trouble some people, but it is necessary if important reforms strongly supported by most consumers are to work.
 These provisions include requiring insurers to cover all people at all times, regardless of health history and without discriminatory pricing. Without the so-called individual mandate, many people who are healthy would decline to buy insurance, knowing that they could purchase it only when they got sick. That would drive up prices for everyone.
 Karen Davis
 President, Commonwealth Fund.
 Young adults are likely to feel the most immediate impact of the legislation. They constitute 19 percent of the uninsured, and among those without insurance, two-thirds report problems getting access to care and half report problems with medical bills or debt.
 By September, young adults will be allowed to remain on their parents' health plans up to age 26. And starting in 2014, Medicaid will be available to all adults with income at or below 133 percent of the federal poverty level -- 7.1 million uninsured people ages 19 to 29. In addition, they will be able to buy coverage through health insurance exchanges, where two-thirds of young adults (those with incomes below four times the poverty level) will receive help paying premiums and medical bills.
 With secure coverage, I think many more adults starting out in life will feel free to follow their dreams rather than the safe road to jobs that offer health benefits.
 Jacob S. Hacker
 Professor political science, Yale University.
 Perhaps the most attractive promise of reform is that if we lack or lose coverage, we'll have the security of knowing we can buy affordable insurance through the exchanges set up by the states. This promise won't be effectively realized, however, unless state and federal leaders charged with setting up the exchanges are pressured to keep private insurance premiums in check.
 After all, 99 percent of local insurance markets are ''highly consolidated,'' according to the American Medical Association, and in 24 states (up from 18 a decade ago), the largest insurer has more than 70 percent of the market. At a minimum, strong exchanges will be needed to encourage competition and transparency.
 Even better, consumers should demand a public insurance option that would compete with private plans -- immediately cutting 10 percent off the average private premium, according to the Congressional Budget Office, and saving the federal government more than $100 billion over 10 years.

HEADLINE: S.E.C. Looks At Wall St. Accounting

BYLINE: By LOUISE STORY

 BODY:
The Securities and Exchange Commission said on Monday it had started an inquiry into about two dozen financial companies to determine whether they followed accounting practices similar to those recently disclosed in an investigation of Lehman Brothers. 
 The commission is interested in transactions known as repurchase agreements, which are a common way that investment banks provide funds for trading activities. The commission wants to know whether other Wall Street players used tactics like those that Lehman used to mask their debt levels from investors. 
 The commission announced that it had sent inquiry letters but did not list the companies they were sent to. The inquiry comes as part of the S.E.C.'s duties to review financial filings of public companies. Any red flags in the answers will be forwarded to the S.E.C.'s enforcement unit, which has the power to bring charges.
 Since Lehman was accused of using a transaction known as Repo 105 in 2008 to hide about $50 billion in debt, analysts have said there should be a widespread inquiry of accounting on Wall Street before the financial crisis. 
 ''There were a multitude of games that were going on in accounting,'' said Janet Tavakoli, president of Tavakoli Structured Finance. ''It's good the S.E.C. is looking at Repo 105, but it obviously leads to other questions.''
 The commission is focusing on all sorts of repurchase agreements, not just those Lehman used. The commission asked the companies if they had classified the transactions, which are often considered loans, as sales. The commission also asked whether those transactions affected data provided to investors, analysts, regulators or ratings agencies.
 In a report, Anton R. Valukas, an examiner appointed by the United States Trustee to determine if there was fraud at Lehman before it collapsed, disclosed the bank's use of repurchase agreements to hide its debt.

HEADLINE: Slight Rise in U.S. Spending in February

BYLINE: By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
Household incomes remained flat in February as a weak jobs market crimped paychecks, the Commerce Department indicated on Monday.
 But even as wages held steady, consumers were more willing to part with the little cash they had on hand -- a trend economists expect to continue. Spending rose 0.3 percent, or $34.7 billion, compared with January, the fifth month of increases. 
 Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist at the Economic Outlook Group, called the report an ''unambiguous sign that consumers are growing more confident.''
 ''There is an enormous amount of pent-up demand, and now it is being unleashed,'' Mr. Baumohl said.
 As the recovery strengthens, analysts expect spending to rise modestly this year. But it will probably be constrained by weak consumer confidence, which is far below historical averages, and high unemployment, with the jobless rate at 9.7 percent.
 In addition, high debt burdens and nervousness about the economy will probably lead Americans to keep a larger-than-usual proportion of their income in savings. The saving rate fell to 3.1 percent last month, its lowest level since October 2008, but it is expected to rise. In early 2008, before the financial crisis sent jitters through the economy, the rate was 1.2 percent.
 ''Households are gradually altering their behavior in the face of large capital losses in investment and real estate portfolios, a weak labor market, and tight credit,'' Joshua Shapiro, chief economist for MFR, wrote in a research note. 
 The labor market continues to shed jobs on a monthly basis, though the pace of losses has decreased and economists believe that the economy might have created jobs in March. 
 Still, even if jobs start reappearing, paychecks are expected to remain suppressed since many employers do not face pressure to raise wages. 
 Wages and salaries, which make up more than half of personal income, were largely flat in February, increasing by $2.7 billion or 0.1 percent. Unusually stormy weather in February, which forced many employers along the East Coast to cut hours, may have held back growth.
 Spending on durable goods, like cars and air-conditioners, fell 0.4 percent in February, while spending on non-durable goods like food and clothing increased 0.7 percent.
 A gauge of prices in the report registered no change, suggesting inflation in the United States was largely tame.
 The Commerce Department said spending levels in January were less robust than previously thought, rising 0.4 percent rather than the original forecast of 0.5 percent. Income was higher than originally reported, rising 0.3 percent rather than the original report of 0.1 percent.

HEADLINE: U.S. to Sell 27% Stake In Citigroup This Year

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
Nearly 18 months after the federal government stepped in to bail out Citigroup, Washington announced plans on Monday to sell off its ownership stake.
 The Treasury said Monday that it planned to sell its 7.7 billion common shares in Citigroup over the course of 2010. It will gradually reduce its 27 percent ownership position through a series of stock sales to investors. 
 The government would earn a profit of about $8 billion if it were to sell its entire stake today. That would be on top of $8.1 billion in interest payments and other fees it has already collected, making Citigroup one of the government's most lucrative investments of the Troubled Asset Relief Program. 
 But just as Citigroup appears to be escaping its history, it will be forced once again next week to face its troubled past. The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, a bipartisan panel assigned to look into the causes of the crisis, is expected to hold two days of hearings on how Citigroup nearly failed and the risk it posed to the financial system.
 Reacting to the news of the stock sale, Citigroup shares fell by 3 percent on Monday. The Treasury is unlikely to begin selling the shares until after Citigroup announces its first-quarter earnings in April, according to people briefed on the situation. 
 In its statement, the Treasury said it intended to sell in ''an orderly and measured fashion,'' but provided few details on the manner, amount or timing of the transactions. Morgan Stanley was chosen to advise the government on the sale.
 With 7.7 billion shares expected to change hands, the Citigroup stock sale will be among the largest in Wall Street's history. It is a major step in the bank's delicate effort to sever its ties with Washington. 
 Only a year and a half ago, Citigroup was teetering near collapse. The Treasury invested $45 billion of taxpayer money and agreed to insure some $300 billion of illiquid assets as part of two rescues to stabilize the bank in the fall of 2008.
 But Citigroup's health, though still fragile, has improved. In December, the bank was allowed to repay $20 billion of bailout funds and ended the federal insurance program, allowing its top executives to escape the harsher set of compensation restrictions imposed on banks that received multiple helpings of taxpayer aid. 
 Still, the government retained a $25 billion investment stake, which had been converted to the 7.7 billion common shares in a third rescue last spring. It delayed plans to begin selling those shares after Citigroup struggled to raise capital at the end of last year. 
 The government still holds other investments in Citi, however. Both the Treasury and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation own trust preferred shares and warrants in the bank stemming from the bailouts. Neither agency has indicated when it will sell those securities.
 Among those expected to testify next week before the financial crisis panel are: Charles O. Prince, Citigroup's former chief executive; David C. Bushnell, the bank's former risk chief; and Robert E. Rubin, the former Treasury secretary and an influential member of Citigroup's leadership team and board, according to people briefed on the hearings. Also expected to testify is Thomas G. Maheras, a head of the investment bank who oversaw its trading activities. 
 Vikram S. Pandit, Citigroup's current chief executive, is not expected to attend the hearings, these people said. Also not expected to testify are the former co-heads of the Citigroup's fixed-income unit, which was largely responsible for its near-collapse.
 The F.D.I.C. will also hold hearings next week on Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the role of several federal financial regulators, including the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. 
 Officials at Citigroup and the F.D.I.C. declined to comment. 

CORRECTION-DATE: March 31, 2010

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Tuesday about the federal government's plans to sell its ownership stake in Citigroup misidentified the entity that will hold hearings next week on the roles of several federal financial regulators. It is the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, or F.C.I.C. -- not the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or F.D.I.C.

HEADLINE: Some Restrictions Relaxed on Nuclear Scientist Under House Arrest in Pakistan

BYLINE: By SALMAN MASOOD and WAQAR GILLANI; Salman Masood reported from Islamabad, and Waqar Gillani from Lahore, Pakistan.

 BODY:
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan -- A Pakistani court on Monday eased some travel restrictions on Abdul Qadeer Khan, the scientist and pioneer of Pakistan's nuclear arsenal who admitted six years ago that he had been running an illicit proliferation network. But the court maintained a prohibition on news interviews with him about his past nuclear activities, according to lawyers involved in the case. 
 Mr. Khan, who is revered in Pakistan, had been put under house arrest in 2004 by former President Pervez Musharraf after Mr. Khan offered an apology to the nation for his nuclear proliferation activities. 
 The details were never publicly disclosed, but Western intelligence officials had said that Mr. Khan created a black market that sold nuclear technology to North Korea, Iran and other countries.
 He was declared a ''free man'' by a court in February 2009 as travel restrictions were lifted and he was allowed to interact with friends and family. But later that year, another court reinstated those restrictions. Pakistan has sought to describe Mr. Khan's proliferation activities as a ''closed chapter'' in its history. That effort has come against the backdrop of meetings recently between the country's powerful army chief, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, and American officials over improving the relationship between Pakistan and the United States.
 Pakistan wants a civilian nuclear deal with the United States structured along the same lines as the American agreement with India, but there is continued apprehension among lawmakers in Washington over Mr. Khan's proliferation record. The safety of the nuclear arsenal in Pakistan, where the military has been fighting militants, is also an underlying concern.
 Privately, Pakistani officials have assured American officials of continued monitoring of Mr. Khan's activities while emphasizing that Pakistan's nuclear weapons are completely secure.
 The court decision Monday on Mr. Khan in the eastern city of Lahore was announced after the government and Mr. Khan had reached an agreement that allowed him limited freedom, according to interviews with the lawyers for both sides.
 Syed Ali Zafar, Mr. Khan's lawyer, characterized the court decision as a reiteration of Mr. Khan's status as a ''free man.'' Unlike earlier conditions, Mr. Khan will now be able to travel within the country without prior approval from Pakistani authorities, but will still have to advise of his movements in advance.
 ''A. Q. Khan will tell the government at least 30 minutes before he leaves his home for moving within Islamabad,'' Mr. Zafar said. ''And, he will have to tell the government at least one day before he schedules to move outside Islamabad.''
 Ahmer Bilal Soofi, a government lawyer, said that under the agreement, Mr. Khan would not issue any statement or interact with any members of the media on the issue of nuclear proliferation.
 A restriction on foreign travel for Mr. Khan remains in effect, lawyers for both sides said.
 A metallurgist by profession, Mr. Khan admitted in a tearful public apology in 2004 that he had sold nuclear technology to several countries, although he did not identify them.
 Pakistani officials have rebuffed demands by Western officials to investigate Mr. Khan over his proliferation activities. 
 Within the country, Mr. Khan remains a highly popular figure, exalted by nationalists and Islamist activists who portray him as a hero in the country's rivalry with nuclear-armed India.

 BODY:
The dramatic passage of health care reform was a historic turning point in the effort to repair a deeply broken system. But by itself, the legislation will not be enough to address the needs of many people of color, who face higher rates of infant mortality, chronic disease and disability, and premature death than white Americans do. 
 The new law will help expand insurance coverage and improve access to health care providers in underserved communities, among other benefits. But the major reasons for the persistence of racial and ethnic health inequalities are socioeconomic inequality and differences in neighborhood living conditions -- both of them fueled by residential segregation. These are the issues that policymakers must tackle if we are to improve opportunities for good health for all. 
 It's not just what the bill will do; it's also what it won't do.
 It won't do anything to lower premiums. Insurance premiums will roughly double over the next 6 to 10 years for people with group coverage through work, just as they would have without the legislation. For nearly 37 million people in the individual insurance market, the new minimum package of benefits means that they can expect to pay 10 to 13 percent more than they would have if the bill hadn't passed. 
 About 57 percent of these workers will receive at least some subsidies to help offset the cost, but 43 percent will have to bear the full cost. True, they will receive more benefits, but it will not be by their choice.
 Everyone should recognize that there will be no parting of the heavens. Changes in a $2.6 trillion industry will not come quickly. For the immediate future, the number of uninsured will most likely keep on rising. Spending will keep increasing at excessive rates. The quality of care will not be instantly transformed. 
 But a process of reform that will take a generation to unfold must begin now. And that requires a sustained effort by health reform supporters to explain to the public what is in the bill and to clear away misconceptions created by opponents.
 Consumers stand to gain enormously from efficient, well-designed health insurance exchanges. But state officials opposed to reform may well stall and create roadblocks. So supporters should mobilize now to see that as many states as possible move promptly to enact the laws necessary to create these exchanges.

HEADLINE: Optimism About Recovery Lifts Shares

BYLINE: By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
A brighter outlook for the American consumer and signs that foreign debt troubles were easing helped propel Wall Street higher on Monday.
 Adding to the momentum, shares of energy companies rose after the price of oil surged nearly 3 percent. Two attacks on the subway system in Russia, a major oil producer, raised concerns about supplies. 
 But much of the focus on Monday was on the health of the economic recovery, as investors recalibrated their portfolios ahead of a data-heavy week. The Commerce Department said that consumer spending rose 0.3 percent in February, even though household income remained flat. 
 ''Spending has been growing even when employment has been weak,'' said Thomas J. Lee, chief United States equity strategist at JPMorgan Chase. ''And it's not like people are borrowing to spend -- they are getting their finances in order and then spending.'' 
 Many analysts interpreted the data as further evidence that a rebound was intact, even though unemployment remained high and the housing market was stuck in a rut.
 ''The consensus is coming around that this is the real deal, that the economic recovery is here,'' said E. William Stone, chief investment strategist for PNC Wealth Management.
 A gauge of inflation in Monday's report remained tame, tempering worries that the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates sooner than expected to ward off price increases.
 Interest rates were steady. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year bill fell 5/32, to 98 1/32, and the yield rose to 3.86 percent from 3.85 percent late Friday.
 Stocks were also helped after Greece, facing imminent deadlines to pay back its debt, successfully sold $6.7 billion in seven-year bonds. It was the country's first offering since the announcement of a rescue plan backed by the European Union.
 ''It kicks the can down the road for a slight amount of time,'' Mr. Stone said. ''They need to deal with their fiscal house, but time is our friend if we are really in a global recovery.'' 
 At the end of trading, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 45.50 points, or 0.42 percent, higher at 10,895.86, still more than 100 points shy of the 11,000 mark. The Dow was helped by gains in Boeing, Caterpillar and Bank of America. 
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 6.63 points, or 0.57 percent, to 1,173.22, and the Nasdaq was up 9.23 points, or 0.39 percent, at 2,404.36.
 Energy stocks drove Monday's rally. Oil rose $2.17 to $82.17 a barrel after suicide bombers set off explosions in two Moscow subway stations, killing more than three dozen people.
 In response, shares of Schlumberger, the oil field services company, rose 2.3 percent, to $63.07 a share, Exxon Mobil climbed 1.1 percent, to $67.30, and Chevron gained 1.1 percent, to $75.23.
 Citigroup fell more than 3 percent, to $4.18 a share, after the Treasury Department said it planned to sell $7.7 billion in common shares as part of its effort to gradually reduce its 27 percent stake in the bank.
 Commodities posted strong gains. The price of gold rose 0.4 percent to $1,109.72 an ounce, and copper was up 3.9 percent. As investors acquired stocks, the dollar weakened 0.3 percent against world currencies, including the euro.
 Investors will get several critical snapshots of the strength of the economy this week. On Tuesday, home prices will be released, and analysts are predicting a slight dip. The housing market remains a chief hurdle to a sustained recovery, with foreclosures rising and sales reaching record lows.
 But the most significant item on the economic calendar comes on Friday, when the Labor Department releases its monthly barometer of the labor market. Analysts say they believe the economy added 200,000 jobs in March, helped in large part by census hiring, and that the unemployment rate remained steady at 9.7 percent. If the report disappoints, it could raise new questions about the durability of the recovery.

HEADLINE: Pro-Democracy Party to Boycott Myanmar's First Vote in Years

BYLINE: By THOMAS FULLER

 BODY:
BANGKOK -- After months of internal debate, members of the party of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the long-detained pro-democracy leader, defied Myanmar's junta by announcing Monday that they would boycott the country's first elections in two decades. 
 The move raises questions about both the future of the Burmese opposition and the credibility of the vote. 
 According to election laws the junta released earlier this month, the decision means that the party that has served as the mainstay of the country's democratic movement for two decades, the National League for Democracy, will be automatically dissolved. Western governments, including the United States and Britain, had said that Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi's participation and that of her party were prerequisites for legitimate elections. 
 On Monday, U Win Tin, a founding member and strategist for the party, said that more than 100 delegates were unanimous in their decision. ''We will ask the people around us not to vote in the election: Please boycott,'' he said in a telephone interview. He said that the party would try to continue political activities after it is disbanded. ''We will work for the people,'' he said.
 The party had been split over whether to participate in the elections, forced to choose between participation that would undercut its principles and a boycott that would dissolve it. Last week, Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi said through a spokesman that she viewed the election process as ''unjust'' and that she felt that the party should not take part.
 ''They made a decision to maintain their dignity,'' said Win Min, a lecturer in contemporary Burmese politics at Payap University in Chiang Mai in northern Thailand. ''They wanted to keep Aung San Suu Kyi as their leader. On the other hand, what is their alternative after this?''
 Mr. Win Min said the National League for Democracy would likely be disbanded by May 6, a deadline set in the election laws. The party's assets, including offices, might be seized. ''Some members may be planning to set up a new party,'' Mr. Win Min said.
 The ruling generals portray the vote as part of a ''roadmap'' to democracy after 48 years of military rule, while diplomats and exile groups view it as window-dressing for the junta's continued hold on power. 
 But some inside Myanmar say they believe the elections offer at least a modest positive step. 
 In recent months the military government has announced nascent liberalization measures that they see as possibly the beginning of a decentralization of power. The measures include issuing permits for private hospitals and schools and allowing private-sector management of the rice industry. 
 But the counterpoint to these economic measures is the consistently hard line that the military has taken with the political force it considers its archenemy, Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi, 64, and her followers. Her party won a landslide victory in 1990, a result that was ignored by the ruling generals and officially nullified just this month.
 The party has been weakened by two decades of harassment, intimidation and imprisonment of many of its members, including Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi and Mr. Win Tin. The party's leaders are aging -- Mr. Win Tin is 81 -- and the membership has dwindled. 
 Among many restrictive measures in the election law, criminal convictions bar candidacy. This includes Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi and Mr. Win Tin among the estimated 2,100 political prisoners in the country, many of whom were leaders of protest movements in 1988 and 2007 and form the core of the country's democracy movement. 
 Taking part in a new election would also have been a signal to people in Myanmar that the National League for Democracy had agreed to forgo its 1990 victory, Mr. Win Tin said. ''We would have to give up all of our political convictions,'' he said. 
 The party also wanted to send a signal to armed ethnic groups in the northern reaches of the country that the election was illegitimate. The junta is demanding that the ethnic groups disarm. 
 ''A sort of civil war will flare up very soon,'' Mr. Win Tin predicted. 
 Mr. Win Tin urged countries in Asia and the West to threaten to withhold aid to the junta. ''Please put more pressure on the government,'' he said. ''That is my message.''
 Mr. Win Tin, who wrote poetry during his nearly two decades in prison, used a concoction of water and red dust from the bricks of his cell to write his verses. He was denied pen and paper in the infamously brutal prison system. 
 Today, he said he is followed by military intelligence whenever he leaves the house. Agents were outside on motorcycle as he spoke to this reporter, he said. 
 ''For me it's as if I were still in prison,'' he said. ''I feel like the whole country is imprisoned,'' he said. 
 This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Delaware and Tennessee Win U.S. School Grants

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON

 BODY:
Delaware and Tennessee beat out 38 other states and the District of Columbia to win a share of $4 billion in federal education grants, convincing the Obama administration that they have bold plans for overhauling their public school systems.
 Delaware is to be awarded about $100 million and Tennessee about $500 million.
 Secretary of Education Arne Duncan said the two states had won because they had written new laws to support their policies and had marshaled overwhelming statewide support from teachers, school districts and business leaders for comprehensive school improvement plans. 
 ''We got 100 percent sign-on,'' said Gov. Jack Markell of Delaware, a Democrat.
 By announcing only two winners in the first round, Mr. Duncan held to his vow that only a small number of states with extremely ambitious plans would prevail in the Race to the Top competition, which aims to promote innovation by rewarding a few states for exemplary progress in areas that President Obama considers crucial to education reform.
 Georgia and Florida came in third and fourth, but won no money.
 The president's goals include expanding charter schools, reworking teacher evaluation systems, improving states' student-data tracking systems and turning around the lowest-performing schools.
 One highlight of Delaware's proposal was a new state law that allows teachers rated as ''ineffective'' for three years to be removed from the classroom, even if they have tenure, the department said.
 Tennessee passed a law that will allow the state to intervene in failing schools and will permit student academic growth to be used in educator evaluations.
 Forty states and the District of Columbia submitted proposals for the competition in January, more than had been originally expected, in part because plunging tax revenues in the recession have left states hungry for federal money. 
 New York came in 15th of the 16 finalists. New York's naming as a finalist had been a surprise because the Legislature did not eliminate caps on the number of charter schools, despite having been pushed to do so by both Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Gov. David A. Paterson. 
 Mr. Duncan had said political influence would play no part in the competition. But by choosing two states with Democratic governors, and by eliminating several strong contenders with Republican governors, including Florida and Georgia, the administration may face grumbling.
 Andy Smarick, a Republican who served in the White House and in the Department of Education under President George W. Bush, said, ''I don't think that political influence was a primary determinant here, but it could have had a secondary effect'' because Democratic leaders in both states persuaded teachers' unions to support their proposals.
 Gov. Phil Bredesen of Tennessee, a Democrat, said in an interview that Republicans like former Senator Bill Frist had contributed a lot to the state's proposal, but that his own role in persuading the Tennessee Education Association, a teachers' union, to sign on had been important, too.
 ''I was able to get the T.E.A. to accept some things that probably a Republican wouldn't have gotten done,'' Mr. Bredesen said.
 Florida and Louisiana were considered by many analysts to have strong chances to win. But the largest teachers' union in Florida urged its locals not to support the plan. And in Louisiana, only 28 of the 70 districts supported the state's plan, which alarmed school board officials by calling for forceful interventions in hundreds of failing schools.
 From among the 41 applicants, 16 first-round finalists were chosen on March 4 -- Colorado, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina and Tennessee.
 Using a 500-point scoring rubric, the reviewers allotted 454.6 points to first-place Delaware, while the District of Columbia, which came in last among the finalists, got 402 points. All states except the winners announced Monday were eligible to submit proposals for the competition's second round, due on June 1, and Mr. Duncan said he would probably pick ''10 to 15'' states as second-round winners in September. They will split the $3.4 billion that remains.
 Mr. Obama has requested an additional $1.3 billion to extend the competition next year.

HEADLINE: Masters Tickets Will Sell; Even Woods Is Secondary

BYLINE: By MIKE TIERNEY

 BODY:
When Tiger Woods declared on March 16 that he would emerge from golf hibernation at the Masters, Dalton Daves of Little Rock, Ark., was offering four tickets to next Wednesday's final practice round on eBay for $1,400.
 The online auction's rules prevented him from raising the asking price to $1,650, as he had wished. 
 ''We all thought Tiger was going to play all along,'' Daves said, regretting that he had not followed his instincts and set a higher original cost. ''We kind of got caught with our pants down.''
 At AAATix, a licensed ticket broker near Birmingham, Ala., Steve Susce, a co-owner, added a ''Tiger clause'' to his deals with providers of Masters tickets for resale.
 Before Woods's announcement, the parties agreed on a base price. ''Then, if Tiger tees it up and hits one ball, we send you something else -- a bonus,'' Susce said.
 Woods's late entry in the wake of his recent personal troubles has affected prices on the so-called secondary ticket market, a major source for access to golf's grandest occasion next week in Augusta, Ga., for those shut out by the normal process. The four-day badges for the tournament proper are otherwise obtainable only by Augusta National members and designated patrons, while tickets to practice rounds next Monday through Wednesday are sold by the club through a lottery.
 But rates are not soaring at the same pace as golf fans' feverish expectation to see Woods swing a 6-iron for the first time on an American fairway since last fall.
 Legal brokers -- who acquire tickets to sports events, concerts and the theater, then resell them for profit -- generally describe the Tiger bump as slight. Though Woods may be the most compelling athlete around, distancing himself from the field with his disclosure of ''repeated irresponsible behavior,'' the appeal of the Masters for most is atypical in this celebrity-driven era.
 ''A single player doesn't make a significant impact at this tournament'' on prices, said Sam Soni, the vice president for procurement at the broker RazorGator, with offices in four cities, including Atlanta.
 The Woods news flash triggered a ''slight surge,'' he said, sending sales up 50 percent for a few days before they subsided.
 To some extent, he suggested, Woods's possible participation was already built into sales prices.
 ''The market almost had anticipated he was coming,'' Soni said. ''I think everyone expected it.''
 At StubHub, based in San Francisco and with offices in 10 cities, sales volume quintupled briefly and its Web site page views spiked up 75 percent the day after his Masters enlistment became known, according to a spokesman, Glenn Lehrman. But sales prices rose by only 10 percent.
 TicketCity in Austin, Tex., had a 30 percent boost in sales prices, although the chief operating officer, Zach Anderson, observed that Woods had merely enhanced the existing momentum.
 ''The Tiger announcement just pushed it over the edge,'' he said.
 Carl White at WebTickets in Atlanta detected a price increase (around 20 percent) more for the practice sessions, especially Wednesday's, which features an informal par-3 competition among Masters contestants.
 ''People can afford them,'' he said. And with no leader boards to gaze at, the galleries are looser, with some more likely drawn just to see Woods than to see his putting stroke.
 One WebTickets client ''doesn't know anything about sports,'' White said, but contacted him about the tournament.
 ''He's hearing Augusta will be the center of the universe,'' White said. ''Some people don't really care about seeing a particular person play. They just want to be part of the circus.''
 In sports, only the Super Bowl and the Kentucky Derby rival the Masters for percentage of broker business conducted with corporate clients. Most tournament attendees from the business world had already made arrangements when Woods committed. Until recently, costs often were not a consideration.
 Prices ebbed last year as many longtime Masters patrons from the corporate side, battered by the recession and sensitive to public scrutiny over entertainment spending, stayed home.
 ''Last spring was the low point,'' Anderson at TicketCity said. ''Corporate dollars were pulled way, way out.''
 At RazorGator, corporate spending is up 60 percent over a year ago, said Soni, calling the turnaround a market recovery. ''We're back to where we were in 2007,'' he said.
 According to Susce at AAATix, sales to the corporate-connected are up only ''a smidge.''
 He added, ''It's not as dead as last year, but people still aren't slinging that AmEx card out.''
 Augusta National sells an undisclosed number of badges for $200, good for next Thursday through Sunday, to people on its patrons list. No new applications are being accepted.
 The club says it does not honor badges that have been transferred and has threatened to revoke buying privileges of those caught reselling. 
 Still, plenty find their way into the hands of ticket brokers, and their buyers are rarely, if ever, denied entrance.
 Major brokers are pitching the four-day badges for as low as $2,250. Badges for single days start in the $650 range. (Some sellers prefer to avoid the one-day badge because it must be retrieved and redistributed after each round.)
 The club charges $36 to Monday's and Tuesday's practice rounds, $41 for Wednesday's. Those tickets are marked up considerably, too, by brokers, with Monday's commonly priced at $200 or more and Wednesday's at a minimum of $450.
 For all Masters tickets bought from StubHub through last week, the average was about $500, according to Lehrman; it was $518 in 2008. Last year's average slumped to $400.
 Various ticket posts on eBay and Craigslist have worked Woods's name into their sales pitches.
 ''Tiger Is Back!'' screamed one. ''See Tiger's Return,'' said another. Some trying to unload Monday practice-round tickets point to the day as his on-course debut since the scandal broke.
 ''I thought people searching for tickets might put 'Tiger' in their search'' on the Internet, said John Gramelspacher of Atlanta, willing to part with his Monday pair for $400.

HEADLINE: Consensus on Climate Change Ends at the TV Weather Desk

BYLINE: By LESLIE KAUFMAN

 BODY:
The debate over global warming has created predictable adversaries, pitting environmentalists against industry and coal-state Democrats against coastal liberals.
 But it has also created tensions between two groups that might be expected to agree on the issue: climate scientists and meteorologists, especially those who serve as television weather forecasters.
 Climatologists, who study weather patterns over time, almost universally endorse the view that the earth is warming and that humans have contributed to climate change. There is less of a consensus among meteorologists, who predict short-term weather patterns. 
 Joe Bastardi, for example, a senior forecaster and meteorologist with AccuWeather, maintains that it is more likely that the planet is cooling, and he distrusts the data put forward by climate scientists as evidence for rising global temperatures. 
 ''There is a great deal of consternation among a lot of us over the readjustment of data that is going on and some of the portrayals that we are seeing,'' Mr. Bastardi said in a video segment posted recently on AccuWeather's Web site. 
 Such skepticism appears to be widespread among TV forecasters, about half of whom have a degree in meteorology. A study released on Monday by researchers at George Mason University and the University of Texas at Austin found that only about half of the 571 television weathercasters surveyed believed that global warming was occurring and fewer than a third believed that climate change was ''caused mostly by human activities.''
 More than a quarter of the weathercasters in the survey agreed with the statement ''Global warming is a scam,'' the researchers found.
 The split between climate scientists and meteorologists is gaining attention in political and academic circles because polls show that public skepticism about global warming is increasing, and weather forecasters -- especially those on television -- dominate communications channels to the public. A study released this year by researchers at Yale and George Mason found that 56 percent of Americans trusted weathercasters to tell them about global warming far more than they trusted other news media or public figures like former Vice President Al Gore or Sarah Palin, the former vice-presidential candidate. 
 The George Mason-Texas survey found that about half of the weathercasters said they had discussed global warming on their broadcasts during chats with anchors, and nearly 90 percent said they had talked about climate change at live appearances at Kiwanis Club-type events.
 Several well-known forecasters -- including John Coleman in San Diego and Anthony Watts, a retired Chico, Calif., weatherman who now has a popular blog -- have been vociferous in their critiques of global warming.
 The dissent has been heightened by recent challenges to climate science, including the discovery of errors in the 2007 report by the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the unauthorized release of e-mail messages from a British climate research center last fall that skeptics say show that climate scientists had tried to suppress data. 
 ''In a sense the question is who owns the atmosphere: the people who predict it every day or the people who predict it for the next 50 years?'' said Bob Henson, a science writer for the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, who trained as a meteorologist and has followed the divide between the two groups. 
 Mr. Henson added, ''And the level of tension has really spiked in recent months.'' 
 The reasons behind the divergence in views are complex. The American Meteorological Society, which confers its coveted seal of approval on qualified weather forecasters, has affirmed the conclusion of the United Nations' climate panel that warming is occurring and that human activities are very likely the cause. In a statement sent to Congress in 2009, the meteorological society warned that the buildup of heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would lead to ''major negative consequences.'' 
 Yet, climate scientists use very different scientific methods from the meteorologists. Heidi Cullen, a climatologist who straddled the two worlds when she worked at the Weather Channel, noted that meteorologists used models that were intensely sensitive to small changes in the atmosphere but had little accuracy more than seven days out. Dr. Cullen said meteorologists are often dubious about the work of climate scientists, who use complex models to estimate the effects of climate trends decades in the future. 
 But the cynicism, said Dr. Cullen, who now works for Climate Central, a nonprofit group that works to bring the science of climate change to the public, is in her opinion unwarranted.
 ''They are not trying to predict the weather for 2050, just generally say that it will be hotter,'' Dr. Cullen said of climatologists. ''And just like I can predict August will be warmer than January, I can predict that.''
 Three years ago, Dr. Cullen found herself in a dispute with meteorologists after she posted a note on the Weather Channel's Web site suggesting that meteorologists should perhaps not receive certification from the meteorological society if they ''can't speak to the fundamental science of climate change.'' 
 Resentment may also play a role in the divide. Climatologists are almost always affiliated with universities or research institutions where a doctoral degree is required. Most meteorologists, however, can get jobs as weather forecasters with a college degree.
 ''There is a little bit of elitist-versus-populist tensions,'' Mr. Henson said. ''There are meteorologists who feel, 'Just because I have a bachelor's degree doesn't mean I don't know what's going on.' ''
 Whatever the reasons, meteorologists are far more likely to question the underlying science of climate change. A study published in the January 2009 newsletter of the American Geophysical Union, the professional association of earth scientists, found that while nearly 90 percent of some 3,000 climatologists who responded agreed that there was evidence of human-driven climate change, 80 percent of all earth scientists and 64 percent of meteorologists agreed with the statement. Only economic geologists who specialized in industrial uses of materials like oil and coal were more skeptical.
 Seeing danger in the divide between climate scientists and meteorologists, a variety of groups concerned with educating the public on climate change -- including the National Environmental Education Foundation, a federally financed nonprofit, and Yale -- are working to close the gap with research and educational forums. In 2008, Yale began holding seminars with weathercasters who are unsure about the climate issue and scientists who are leading experts in the field. The Columbia Journalism Review explored the reasons for the split in an article this year.
 Conversely, the Heartland Institute, a free-market research organization skeptical about the causes and severity of climate change, is also making efforts to reach out. At its annual conference to be held in May in Chicago, the institute tried without success to put on a special session for the weather predictors.
 ''What we've recognized is that the everyday person doesn't come across climatologists, but they do come across meteorologists,'' said Melanie Fitzpatrick, a climate scientist for the Union of Concerned Scientists. ''Meteorologists do need to understand more about climate because the public confuses this so much. That is why you see efforts in this turning up.''

To the Editor:
 David Leonhardt's March 24 front-page Economic Scene column, ''In the Process, Pushing Back at Inequality,'' suggests that there was no legislation ''worth its own section in the history books'' since Medicare's creation in 1965. 
 Really? That forgets the Reagan tax cuts that reignited the economy and led to nearly 20 million new jobs; the 1996 welfare reforms producing historic declines in dependence and poverty; the 1997 Balanced Budget Act, creating the successful S-Chip program while yielding the first balanced budgets in a generation; and the 2003 Medicare Modernization Act, which added a valuable prescription-drug benefit for the elderly at far below the projected costs.
 Maybe your history book doesn't include chapters on those successful reforms, but it should.

HEADLINE: 9 Are Accused Of Militia Plot To Kill Police

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY and CHARLIE SAVAGE; Nick Bunkley reported from Clayton, Mich., and Charlie Savage from Washington. Mary M. Chapman contributed reporting from Detroit.

 BODY:
CLAYTON, Mich. -- David B. Stone Sr. and his wife, Tina, made no secret about the fact that they were part of a militia, neighbors say. The couple frequently let visitors in military fatigues erect tents in front of their trailer home at the intersection of rural dirt roads, and the sound of gunfire was routine.
 ''In Michigan, I don't think it's that big of a deal to be in a militia,'' said Tom McDormett, a neighbor. 
 He added: ''They would practice shooting, but that's not a big deal. People do that all the time out here.'' 
 But last Saturday night, Mr. McDormett watched through binoculars as the police raided the Stones' home, tearing off plywood from the base of their two connected single-wide trailers to search under the floors. By Monday, the Stones were in green prison garb in a federal courthouse in Detroit, two of nine defendants facing sedition and weapons charges in connection with what Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. called an ''insidious plan.''
 In an indictment against the nine unsealed on Monday, the Justice Department said they were part of a group of apocalyptic Christian militants who were plotting to kill law enforcement officers in hopes of inciting an antigovernment uprising, the latest in a recent surge in right-wing militia activity.
 The court filing said the group, which called itself the Hutaree, planned to kill an unidentified law enforcement officer and then bomb the funeral caravan using improvised explosive devices based on designs used against American troops by insurgents in Iraq.
 ''This is an example of radical and extremist fringe groups which can be found throughout our society,'' Andrew Arena, the F.B.I. special agent in charge in Detroit, said in a statement. ''The F.B.I. takes such extremist groups seriously, especially those who would target innocent citizens and the law enforcement officers who protect the citizens of the United States.''
 The Hutaree -- a word Mr. Stone apparently made up to mean Christian warriors -- saw the local police as ''foot soldiers'' for the federal government, which the group viewed as its enemy, along with other participants in what the group's members deemed to be a ''New World Order'' working on behalf of the Antichrist, the indictment said. 
 Eight defendants were arrested over the weekend in raids in Michigan, Ohio and Indiana, the Justice Department said. The authorities arrested the Stones' eldest son, Joshua M. Stone, 21, shortly before 9 p.m. Monday in Pittsford, Mich., about 20 miles west of his family's home, an F.B.I. spokeswoman, Sandra Berchtold, said.
 A grand jury had secretly returned the indictments against the nine last Tuesday.
 A law enforcement official said the plot appeared to be unconnected to recent threats against Democratic lawmakers who voted for legislation overhauling the nation's health care system. According to the indictment, the group -- apparently centered in Lenawee County, about 70 miles southwest of Detroit -- has been meeting regularly since at least August 2008.
 The group's Web site suggested that it was motivated by apocalyptic religious scenarios more than any secular political fears. A rare mention of earthly politics on the site is a page devoted to discussion of efforts to unite Europe, with a suggestion that one high-ranking European official, Javier Solana, might be the Antichrist.
 Chip Berlet, a senior analyst at Political Research Associates, a liberal-leaning nonprofit group that tracks far-right networks, said the Hutaree's philosophy was drawn from a populist strand that fuses fear of a conspiracy to create a one-world government with a belief that a war is imminent between Christians and the Antichrist, as described in the Bible's Book of Revelation. 
 In April 2009, the Department of Homeland Security produced a report warning of a rising threat of right-wing terrorism, citing factors like economic troubles, the election of a black president and perceived threats to United States sovereignty.
 Mark Potok, who leads a program that tracks right-wing groups for the Southern Poverty Law Center, said it first took note of the Hutaree last year amid a surge in new ''Patriot'' movement groups, race-based hate groups, extremist anti-immigrant groups, Christian militants and other variations.
 ''We're seeing all kinds of radical right-wing groups grow very rapidly, especially in the militia world,'' Mr. Potok said.
 The indictment said the Hutaree, in anticipation of a war against its enemies, had been engaging in ''military-style training,'' from weapons proficiency drills to ''close quarter battle drills'' and the use of ''ambush kill zones.'' The small group had acquired guns, ammunition, medical supplies, uniforms, communications equipment and ''explosives and other components for destructive devices,'' it said.
 After attacking the police, the members planned to retreat to several planned ''rally points'' and wait for the authorities to come after them. They were preparing fighting positions as well as ''trip-wired and command-detonated'' bombs, it said.
 ''It is believed by the Hutaree that this engagement would then serve as a catalyst for a more widespread uprising against the government,'' the indictment said.
 In addition, Mr. Stone had announced ''a covert reconnaissance exercise'' in April, during which ''anyone who happened upon the exercise who did not acquiesce to Hutaree demands could be killed,'' the indictment said. 
 The United States attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan, Barbara McQuade, said the government raided the group this past weekend because that exercise would have ''had the potential of placing an unsuspecting member of the public at risk.''
 The Hutaree Web site features the motto ''Preparing for the end time battles to keep the testimony of Jesus Christ alive'' and a video showing rifle-toting men in camouflage running through woods and firing weapons. 
 ''Jesus wanted us to be ready to defend ourselves using the sword and stay alive using equipment,'' the Web site says, adding, ''The Hutaree will one day see its enemy and meet him on the battlefield if so God wills it.''
 By Monday, the Stones' house stood empty, its front door ajar and two dogs still tied up in the muddy yard, which was littered with dilapidated furniture, a washing machine and tires.
 The Stones' two sons were among those arrested. Joshua, the eldest, left the local school system after the fifth grade in 1999 to be home-schooled, and the younger son, David B. Stone Jr., 19, had never been enrolled, an official said.
 Also charged were Joshua J. Clough, 28, of Blissfield, Mich.; Michael D. Meeks, 40, of Manchester, Mich.; Thomas W. Piatek, 46, of Whiting, Ind.; Kristopher T. Sickles, 27, of Sandusky, Ohio; and Jacob Ward, 33, of Huron, Ohio.
 They could face a maximum penalty of life in prison if convicted of the most serious charge, attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction.

HEADLINE: Do You Have Health Insurance Now?

BYLINE: By FARHANA HOSSAIN

 BODY:
The new health care law is expected to extend coverage to as many as 32 million uninsured Americans over the next decade. Under the law, most Americans will be required to have health insurance by 2014 and the most affluent households will face higher taxes. Here, how the overhaul could affect those who have health insurance now and those who do not.
 If you're sick, you could get coverage three months from now.
 If you have a pre-existing medical condition and have been uninsured for more than six months, you can get subsidized coverage through a new high-risk insurance pool until 2014, when insurers can no longer refuse applicants with pre-existing conditions. The premiums for the program will be ''established for a standard population,'' according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Annual out-ofpocket medical costs will be capped at $5,950 for individuals and $11,900 for families. 
 You could qualify for Medicaid, the federal-state program for the poor. 
 Medicaid will cover everyone under the age of 65 earning below 133 percent of the federal poverty level -- about $14,400 for individuals and $29,327 for a family of four. Childless adults are now typically excluded from Medicaid and many parents often face tighter restrictions. In 2009, only about a dozen states covered parents earning more than 133 percent of poverty level.
 You could buy insurance in the new state-run insurance exchanges. 
 If your employer does not cover you, and you earn too much to qualify for Medicaid, you can buy coverage through your state's insurance exchange -- a marketplace where you can compare benefits and prices and choose the policy that best suits your needs. People who earn up to four times the poverty threshold -- $88,200 for a family of four -- will get subsidies. That means you will pay somewhere between 2 percent and 9.5 percent of your income for premiums. Your out-of-pocket costs will also be capped.
 You may pay fines if you remain uninsured. 
 The penalty starts at $95 or 1 percent of income in 2014, whichever is higher, and rises to $695 or 2.5 percent of income in 2016. But families will not pay more than $2,085. 
 You will not be penalized if: You are an American Indian. You have religious objections. You can show financial hardship. You would pay more than 8 percent of your income for the cheapest available plan. Your income is below the tax-filing threshold -- $9,350 for individuals and $18,700 for couples in 2009.
 On Your Own
 You can keep your current plan 
 The plan will have to stop some practices within six months, like setting lifetime limits on coverage, but it doesn't have to meet the new coverage standards required of all policies in 2014. The plan may not be viable for long because insurers cannot add benefits or enroll more people in noncompliant policies.
 or, starting in 2014, you can buy coverage through the exchanges. 
 If your income is below four times the poverty level ($43,320 a year in 2010), you can get tax credits to help with your premiums. Out-of-pocket costs, like co-payments, will also be capped.
 Premiums for individual plans will be 10 to 13 percent higher by 2016 than the average premium that year under prior law, according to the Congressional Budget Office. But most people would qualify for subsidies, meaning they might pay less than they do now.
 Starting in 2013, you may pay higher taxes. 
 If you are an individual making more than $200,000, or a family making more than $250,000, you will contribute more to the Medicare program from your payroll taxes -- 2.35 percent instead of the current 1.45 percent. Your investment income, now exempt from the payroll tax, will also be subject to a 3.8 percent levy.
 You must spend more than 10 percent of your income on medical expenses before they can be deducted, up from the existing 7.5 percent threshold.
 Through Your Employer
 You can keep your current plan 
 The plan will have to stop some practices within six months, like setting lifetime limits on coverage, but it doesn't have to meet the new coverage standards, unless the insurer makes significant changes in benefits or cost-sharing.
 or, starting in 2014, you can buy coverage through the exchanges.
 If your employer's plan covers less than 60 percent of the costs, or you are paying more than 9.5 percent of your income to get it, you can buy in the exchange.
 If your income is below four times the poverty level, and your premiums cost more than 8 percent of your income, but less than 9.8 percent, you can get a voucher from your employer to buy in the exchange. Starting in 2013, you may pay higher taxes.
 Top earners will pay increased Medicare payroll tax on wages and investments.
 The income threshold for claiming tax deductions on medical costs will be higher.
 Flexible spending accounts -- which typically allow employees to shelter as much as $4,000 or $5,000 from taxes -- will be reduced to $2,500, and they will not pay for over-the-counter drugs.
 If you have a disability
 Starting in 2011, workers can choose to take part in a long-term-care insurance program, which will provide cash benefits if they become disabled after paying premiums for some years.
 If you have high-value plan 
 In 2018, the most expensive insurance policies will be subject to a new tax, which means beneficiaries could face higher out-of-pocket costs or reduced benefits.
 Through Medicare
 You will pay less for preventive care.
 Medicare will pay for an annual checkup. And deductibles and co-payments for many preventive services and screenings will be eliminated.
 If you receive prescription drug benefits 
 If you hit the gap in coverage of prescription drugs, known as the ''doughnut hole,'' you will receive a $250 rebate this year and a 50 percent discount on brand-name drugs in 2011. The government would completely close the doughnut hole by 2020 by phasing in additional discounts on brand-name and generic drugs.
 If you are an individual who makes more than $85,000, or part of a household that earns more than $170,000, you will pay higher premiums starting in 2011.
 If you are enrolled in a private Medicare Advantage plan 
 You may face higher premiums or reduced benefits. In 2012, the government would begin to cut subsidies to these plans run by private insurance companies. These plans cost the government more, on average, than traditional Medicare, but often provide more comprehensive coverage.
 If you live in an area where primary care doctors are in short supply 
 From 2011 through 2015, Medicare will pay a 10 percent bonus to doctors who participate in underserved areas, like inner cities and rural communities.
 Through Medicaid
 You can continue your coverage.
 States have to maintain current income eligibility for the program until 2014 for most adults and 2019 for children, but beneficiaries may lose some optional benefits, like dental and vision care. Because of the economic downturn, many states had made or were considering substantial cuts in the public program for the poor and the disabled. (States also cannot reduce eligibility until 2019 for the Children's Health Insurance Program, which covers children in families that earn too much to qualify for Medicaid, but too little to afford private health insurance.)
 You may have more doctors to choose from.
 In 2013 and 2014, Medicaid's reimbursements to doctors will be increased to the same level as Medicare, so more doctors may be willing to participate in the program. In 2008, Medicaid reimbursements averaged only 72 percent of the rates paid by Medicare, according to a recent Urban Institute study.
 You may pay less for preventive care.
 Next year, states will receive additional money to offer certain preventive services recommended by the government without additional cost to Medicaid beneficiaries. Also, starting in October, Medicaid programs will be required to cover services that help pregnant women quit smoking.
 If you require institutional care because of a disability or a chronic illness 
 States will receive incentives to offer home- and community-based services to chronically ill and disabled individuals through Medicaid.
 Effect on Insurers
 Within six months
 Plans that include coverage of children cannot deny coverage for a pre-existing condition. Plans cannot drop people when they become sick.
 Young adults can stay on their parents' plan until they turn 26. The rule does not apply to employer-sponsored plans if the child's job offers health insurance. 2014 and after
 Insurers cannot deny coverage because of a person's medical condition or charge higher premiums because of a person's sex or health status.
 All new plans have to offer a minimum package of benefits defined by the federal government, including certain preventive services without any costs.
 Effect on Employers
 2010 to 2013 
 Small businesses will receive tax credits to offer coverage to their employees. If an employer pays at least half of its employee's premiums, it can receive a tax credit up to 35 percent of the contribution.2014 and after 
 Small businesses can buy insurance through the exchanges and get a tax credit up to 50 percent of employees' premiums for two years. 
 An employer with more than 50 workers will pay a penalty if it does not offer health insurance and any of its full-time workers get subsidized coverage in the exchanges.

HEADLINE: Racing Against Time, Act II

BYLINE: By DAVID STREITFELD

 BODY:
DES MOINES -- Nine hundred days after putting their house on the market, Andrew and Jane Palestini were beginning to think they might be stuck in Iowa forever.
 The looming expiration of the government's housing tax credit pushed them into action. They dropped their price by an additional $10,000, to $235,000. Somewhat to their shock, a buyer emerged. The house is now under contract.
 ''I can't feel happy,'' said Mr. Palestini, a retired administrative law judge with the Social Security Administration. ''Just relieved.''
 After several disastrous months for home sales across the country, when volume dropped by 23 percent, the pace appears to be picking up again. The number of Des Moines homes under contract in February rose by a third from the January level. The number of pending contracts jumped 10 percent in Naples, Fla., 14 percent in Houston and 21 percent in Portland, Ore. 
 These deals will be reflected in the national sales reports when they become final, this month or next. There is no evidence that prices have begun to move in response to the higher volume. Indeed, so many homes are coming on the market that prices might well fall further.
 Real estate agents say buyers and sellers are hurrying to take advantage of the tax credit, which is worth up to $8,000 for home buyers. But the last-minute rush is also prompting some foreboding about what will happen to the market on April 30 when the credit ends -- and whether it is too risky to let it end at all. 
 James M. Poterba, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, calls this ''the exit strategy problem.'' 
 ''If you have a short-run program to stimulate demand, it's always tricky to figure out how you gently remove it without going off a precipice,'' he said.
 Arguments for extending the tax credit a second time are just beginning. Robert Shiller, a professor of economics at Yale and co-developer of the Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller housing price index, is an early advocate. He thinks the credit was a bad idea that nevertheless the market cannot do without.
 ''You don't make drug addicts go cold turkey,'' Mr. Shiller said. ''The credit interferes with the market in an arbitrary way, but ending it now would be psychologically powerful. People will be in a bad mood about buying a house.'' He advocates phasing it out gradually.
 In some states, worries about the housing market are trumping fiscal considerations. They are adopting or extending tax credits or other supportive measures in hopes of bringing the market to life. 
 California last week renewed a $10,000 credit that proved popular last year, allocating $200 million for it despite a state budget crisis. New Jersey legislators just introduced a bill that would give buyers a $15,000 credit spread over three years. South Carolina recently announced a $7,000 down payment assistance program for teachers, police officers and firefighters.
 As it has been for several years, housing remains the most coddled and the most troubled sector of the economy. Outside the realm of real estate, many of the government banking programs created to deal with the crisis have ended, and credit markets have largely returned to normal. On March 8, the Federal Reserve held its final auction in a two-year-old program that offered banks emergency short-term loans. 
 A few days earlier, however, government regulators extended a refinancing program for homeowners whose properties had plunged in value. Originally due to expire in June, the program has been renewed to the middle of 2011 ''to support and promote market stability,'' the Federal Housing Finance Agency said.
 On Monday, just three days after substantially expanding its antiforeclosure programs, the Obama administration announced another $600 million to finance innovative measures to help defaulting families in five hard-hit states: North Carolina, Oregon, Ohio, Rhode Island and South Carolina. The first round of financing, announced last month, provided $1.5 billion to states including California and Florida.
 Supported by an array of government programs aimed at both reducing foreclosures and encouraging traditional sales, housing was supposed to be on the road to a solid recovery. 
 An earlier version of the tax credit created a rush to buy in the fall, when people thought it would expire Nov. 30. The housing industry argued that sales would fall off a cliff if the credit were not extended and broadened, so Congress went along.
 Stan Humphries, the executive in charge of data and analytics at the housing site Zillow.com, said government support was crucial in breaking housing's acute fall in 2007 and 2008, but that it had also obscured the actual weakness of the market.
 ''Many people got the sense last year that we had bottomed out and were going to rebound in a V-shaped recovery,'' he said. 
 Instead, the sales volume of existing homes declined in December more steeply than in any month in the four decades that such numbers have been tracked. Sales dropped again in January and February. Meanwhile, the sales volume of new homes fell in January to the lowest level since record-keeping began in 1963, a record broken again in February.
 Buyers who want the tax credit must sign a deal by April 30 but would have until June 30 to close. Consequently, if sales volume is going to plunge after the credit expires, it will not show up until the numbers for July are reported. While Mr. Humphries says he does not expect sales that month to fall by December's record rate, he predicts a long period of merely ''dragging along the bottom,'' with prices to match.
 That was just what the Palestinis were worried about.
 If they did not sell by April 30, they anticipated having to lower their price yet again, to compensate any buyer for the credit he would no longer get. It also meant they would not get a credit themselves on buying a new home in Philadelphia, pushing down what they could afford to pay.
 It has been an unexpected ordeal. The Palestinis bought their spacious ranch house in the Des Moines suburb of Clive for $185,000 in 1995, after looking for only three days. ''My feeling was it would never be a problem selling,'' said Jane Palestini, a retired specialist in adoptions from China. ''Ha, ha, ha.''
 In early 2007, the house across the street sold in three days, but the Palestinis spent the summer getting their place ready. By the time they put it on the market that September for $265,000, prices were falling. 
 For months, they lived in a state of readiness for prospective buyers. To minimize clutter, they carted off many of their possessions to self-storage. They bought new pillows and kept them mounded on the beds. They bought fresh flowers and baked hundreds of cookies.
 The months became years. They know their mistake: They should have kept cutting the price until they sold. But every dollar they dropped their price was one dollar less for a down payment in Philadelphia.
 Their house is under contract for $225,000. After paying the agent's commission and subtracting the cost of remodeling the kitchen, the Palestinis are at best breaking even. ''You just have to ignore how much it's going to hurt,'' Mr. Palestini said.
 At least they have escaped whatever trouble is to come this summer.
 Their agent, Jim Heldenbrand, told them he hoped the credit would ''get the momentum going.'' But he also mentioned the plans of a colleague in real estate: As soon as the credit expires, the man plans to get on his Harley and just keep riding south.

HEADLINE: Alstom at Center of Web of Bribery Inquiries

BYLINE: By CLAUDIO GATTI; Claudio Gatti is an investigative reporter based in New York for the Italian newspaper Il Sole-24 Ore and The International Herald Tribune.

 BODY:
The detention last week of three executives at the British unit of the French industrial giant Alstom was the latest in a tangle of investigations regarding possible bribes paid by the conglomerate to secure contracts around the world, according to investigators in several countries.
 Some cases go back years, while others are still being investigated and prosecuted. At least two arrests were made in Europe this year, while a recent case in Italy resulted in guilty pleas from four Alstom executives and two Alstom business units, as well as fines.
 In addition, the fraud division of the Justice Department is looking into the possibility that the Italian case -- which involved bribes paid by Alstom for a contract awarded by a division of the state-controlled utility Enel -- was one of several incidents in which Alstom Power Inc., an American subsidiary, improperly used agents to acquire contracts around the world, according to investigators who did not want to be identified because the inquiry was not yet public.
 The Alstom cases are part of an increasing number of investigations into corporate bribery in recent years. Prosecutors and advocacy groups like Transparency International have stepped up the pressure on multinational corporations after the adoption of an international convention outlawing bribery of foreign officials, which came into force just over a decade ago. 
 Siemens, the German industrial conglomerate, pleaded guilty in 2008 in the United States and Germany to paying more than $800 million in bribes to foreign officials through a network of fictitious agents. Siemens paid criminal and civil penalties of more than $1.6 billion.
 Last week, The New York Times reported that the German carmaker Daimler had agreed to pay about $185 million in fines, and that two subsidiaries would plead guilty to bribing foreign government officials, to settle a multiyear corruption investigation.
 Daimler, the maker of Mercedes-Benz and Smart brand cars, cooperated with the investigation and will avoid indictment, said a person with knowledge of the case, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the details of the agreement had not yet been made public.
 A hearing in the case is scheduled for Thursday in Federal District Court in Washington.
 ''At this moment, I know of 345 cases worldwide in different stages of investigation for violation of national and international anticorruption legislation,'' said Mark Pieth, chairman of the working group on bribery of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris. Five years ago, Mr. Pieth said, about 100 cases were under investigation.
 The escalation in bribery investigations ''may be seen as a sign of things getting worse,'' Mr. Pieth said. ''But I see the positive of it. I see law enforcement agencies around the world, and not just the United States, that dare to act on suspicion of corruption.''
 Alstom, a power and transport conglomerate with 80,000 employees worldwide and annual sales of 18.7 billion euros, or $25.2 billion, has been named in connection with investigations in Australia, Europe and South America.
 A spokesman at Alstom's corporate headquarters near Paris acknowledged that investigations were under way in Brazil, Britain and Switzerland, but said they had not led to any legal action against the parent company in France. 
 The settlement in Italy was ''not for bribery but for mistakes in the contract process,'' the Alstom spokesman said. He added that the company had ''put in place and reinforced over the past years a very strict ethics and compliance process.''
 He declined to comment on any cases in Australia, Poland or the United States.
 The O.E.C.D. Anti-Bribery Convention, to which 38 countries are now signatories, forbids companies from making even indirect pay-for-play arrangements with governments. Companies, however, have used agents to go around that restriction.
 An inquiry in Britain and Australia focuses on the use of one such agent in Europe to secure contracts in Vietnam. The agent, Company for Technology and Development, based in Hanoi, is believed to be a front for government officials in Hanoi, according to law enforcement officials, who declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly.
 In November 2009, the Australian Federal Police opened an investigation into the use of Company for Technology and Development by Securency International, an Australian company that owns a patented formula for polymer-based bank notes, to help win a contract with the Vietnamese national bank.
 According to European law enforcement officials, who asked to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to speak, Australia is now coordinating its investigation with the Serious Fraud Office in Britain because evidence was found that the same agent was used by European subsidiaries of Alstom. The three executives of the British unit of Alstom were questioned last week about allegations of bribery, money laundering and false accounting.
 Alstom declined to comment on the case.
 The Polish investigation involves Bohdan Zun, the former director general of Warsaw MetroProjekt, the capital's transportation authority, a representative for Marius Grzegorowski, the prosecutor investigating the case, said. Mr. Zun was in charge of MetroProjekt when it awarded a 105 million euro contract to Alstom for subway cars.
 Mr. Zun was arrested by the Polish police in January and accused of fixing the results of the tender in Alstom's favor. In March a second suspect, a consultant named Tadeus Novak, was arrested by Spanish police in Barcelona and ''accused of helping in the distribution of bribes'' as the result of ''an investigation regarding a contract between Metroprojekt and Alstom,'' a representative for Marius Grzegorowski said.
 The Alstom spokesman said the company had ''no information'' on the case in Poland.
 Another case under investigated in Brazil and Switzerland involves payments from Alstom to executives from Petrobras, the Brazilian state-run oil company, through a consulting firm called Aramza based in Montevideo, Uruguay, according to law enforcement officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation was active.
 ''Several federal and state authorities in Brazil have launched investigations which allegedly concern Alstom among other companies, but none of these investigations has legally concluded on any charge against Alstom,'' the Alstom spokesman said.
 The investigation by Swiss authorities, which may turn out to be the most pervasive, began in 2006 and focuses on a subsidiary called Alstom Prom, which consisted of a single executive, Bruno Kalin, and two secretaries in Baden, Switzerland. Mr. Kalin was arrested by the Swiss police in August 2008 on charges of attempted bribery and mismanagement of company funds.
 Three months later, a federal judge in Bellinzona, Switzerland, issued a statement saying that ''due to the evidence presented to the court, there is a strong suspicion that the defendant actively participated in the laundering of money out of the Alstom Group for the purpose of corrupt payments.''
 The Alstom spokesman noted, however, that Swiss prosecutors ''so far have not produced any evidence allowing them to charge the company.''
 Alstom Prom is, however, implicated in a different case in Lugano, Switzerland. It involves reports of payments of bribes to two top executives of EnelPower, a subsidiary of the Italian state-controlled electricconglomerate Enel, which in 2001 awarded Alstom a contract for a boiler at a power plant in Sardinia.
 Four Alstom executives, including Mr. Kalin and Fritz Gautschi, the former head of a Connecticut-based subsidiary called Alstom Power Inc., pleaded guilty in the case. The consultant they used to pay the bribes to the Enel executives, a Dubai-based businessman named Hussein al-Nowais, acknowledged his role in the course of the proceedings.
 In a deposition submitted to the Italian magistrate, Eugenio Fusco, Mr. Nowais said an EnelPower executive, Luigi Giuffrida, ''expected a kickback from part of my fee. He said that there would have been more opportunities to do business.''
 Alstom Prom and Alstom Power pleaded guilty to an administrative offense.
 Each was sentenced by a Milan court to reimburse the Italian state for the amount of the bribe, 597,220 euros, and to pay a fine of 240,000 euros.

HEADLINE: State Debt Woes Grow Too Big to Camouflage

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
California, New York and other states are showing many of the same signs of debt overload that recently took Greece to the brink -- budgets that will not balance, accounting that masks debt, the use of derivatives to plug holes, and armies of retired public workers who are counting on benefits that are proving harder and harder to pay. 
 And states are responding in sometimes desperate ways, raising concerns that they, too, could face a debt crisis.
 New Hampshire was recently ordered by its State Supreme Court to put back $110 million that it took from a medical malpractice insurance pool to balance its budget. Colorado tried, so far unsuccessfully, to grab a $500 million surplus from Pinnacol Assurance, a state workers' compensation insurer that was privatized in 2002. It wanted the money for its university system and seems likely to get a lesser amount, perhaps $200 million. 
 Connecticut has tried to issue its own accounting rules. Hawaii has inaugurated a four-day school week. California accelerated its corporate income tax this year, making companies pay 70 percent of their 2010 taxes by June 15. And many states have balanced their budgets with federal health care dollars that Congress has not yet appropriated.
 Some economists fear the states have a potentially bigger problem than their recession-induced budget woes. If investors become reluctant to buy the states' debt, the result could be a credit squeeze, not entirely different from the financial strains in Europe, where markets were reluctant to refinance billions in Greek debt. 
 ''If we ran into a situation where one state got into trouble, they'd be bailed out six ways from Tuesday,'' said Kenneth S. Rogoff, an economics professor at Harvard and a former research director of the International Monetary Fund. ''But if we have a situation where there's slow growth, and a bunch of cities and states are on the edge, like in Europe, we will have trouble.'' 
 California's stated debt -- the value of all its bonds outstanding -- looks manageable, at just 8 percent of its total economy. But California has big unstated debts, too. If the fair value of the shortfall in California's big pension fund is counted, for instance, the state's debt burden more than quadruples, to 37 percent of its economic output, according to one calculation. 
 The state's economy will also be weighed down by the ballooning federal debt, though California does not have to worry about those payments as much as its taxpaying citizens and businesses do. 
 Unstated debts pose a bigger problem to states with smaller economies. If Rhode Island were a country, the fair value of its pension debt would push it outside the maximum permitted by the euro zone, which tries to limit government debt to 60 percent of gross domestic product, according to Andrew Biggs, an economist with the American Enterprise Institute who has been analyzing state debt. Alaska would not qualify either.
 State officials say a Greece-style financial crisis is a complete nonissue for them, and the bond markets so far seem to agree. All 50 states have investment-grade credit ratings, with California the lowest, and even California is still considered ''average,'' according to Moody's Investors Service. The last state that defaulted on its bonds, Arkansas, did so during the Great Depression. 
 Goldman Sachs, in a research report last week, acknowledged the pension issue but concluded the states were very unlikely to default on their debt and noted the states had 30 years to close pension shortfalls. 
 Even though about $5 billion of municipal bonds are in default today, the vast majority were issued by small local authorities in boom-and-bust locations like Florida, said Matt Fabian, managing director of Municipal Market Advisors, an independent consulting firm. The issuers raised money to pay for projects like sewer connections and new roads in subdivisions that collapsed in the subprime mortgage disaster. 
 The states, he said, are different. They learned a lesson from New York City, which got into trouble in the 1970s by financing its operations with short-term debt that had to be rolled over again and again. When investors suddenly lost confidence, New York was left empty-handed. To keep that from happening again, Mr. Fabian said, most states require short-term debt to be fully repaid the same year it is issued.
 Some states have taken even more forceful measures to build creditor confidence. New York State has a trustee that intercepts tax revenues and makes some bond payments before the state can get to the money. California has a ''continuous appropriation'' for debt payments, so bondholders know they will get their interest even when the budget is hamstrung.
 The states can also take refuge in America's federalist system. Thus, if California were to get into hot water, it could seek assistance in Washington, and probably come away with some funds. Already, the federal government is spending hundreds of millions helping the states issue their bonds. 
 Professor Rogoff, who has spent most of his career studying global debt crises, has combed through several centuries' worth of records with a fellow economist, Carmen M. Reinhart of the University of Maryland, looking for signs that a country was about to default. 
 One finding was that countries ''can default on stunningly small amounts of debt,'' he said, perhaps just one-fourth of what stopped Greece in its tracks. ''The fact that the states' debts aren't as big as Greece's doesn't mean it can't happen.'' 
 Also, officials and their lenders often refused to admit they had a debt problem until too late.
 ''When an accident is waiting to happen, it eventually does,'' the two economists wrote in their book, titled ''This Time Is Different'' -- the words often on the lips of policy makers just before a debt bomb exploded. ''But the exact timing can be very difficult to guess, and a crisis that seems imminent can sometimes take years to ignite.''
 In Greece, a newly elected prime minister may have struck the match last fall, when he announced that his predecessor had left a budget deficit three times as big as disclosed. 
 Greece's creditors might have taken the news in stride, but in their weakened condition, they did not want to shoulder any more risk from Greece. They refused to refinance its maturing $54 billion euros ($72 billion) of debt this year unless it adopted painful austerity measures. 
 Could that happen here? 
 In January, incoming Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey announced that his predecessor, Jon S. Corzine, had concealed a much bigger deficit than anyone knew. Mr. Corzine denied it. 
 So far, the bond markets have been unfazed. 
 Moody's currently rates New Jersey's debt ''very strong,'' though a notch below the median for states. Moody's has also given the state a negative outlook, meaning its rating is likely to decline over the medium term. Merrill Lynch said on Monday that New Jersey's debt should be downgraded to reflect the cost of paying its retiree pensions and health care. 
 In fact, New Jersey and other states have used a whole bagful of tricks and gimmicks to make their budgets look balanced and to push debts into the future.
 One ploy reminiscent of Greece has been the use of derivatives. While Greece used a type of foreign-exchange trade to hide debt, the derivatives popular with states and cities have been interest-rate swaps, contracts to hedge against changing rates. 
 The states issued variable-rate bonds and used the swaps in an attempt to lock in the low rates associated with variable-rate debt. The swaps would indeed have saved money had interest rates gone up. But to get this protection, the states had to agree to pay extra if interest rates went down. And in the years since these swaps came into vogue, interest rates have mostly fallen. 
 Swaps were often pitched to governments with some form of upfront cash payment -- perhaps an amount just big enough to close a budget deficit. That gave the illusion that the house was in order, but in fact, such deals just added hidden debt, which has to be paid back over the life of the swaps, often 30 years. 
 Some economists think the last straw for states and cities will be debt hidden in their pension obligations. 
 Pensions are debts, too, after all, paid over time just like bonds. But states do not disclose how much they owe retirees when they disclose their bonded debt, and state officials steadfastly oppose valuing their pensions at market rates. 
 Joshua Rauh, an economist at Northwestern University, and Robert Novy-Marx of the University of Chicago, recently recalculated the value of the 50 states' pension obligations the way the bond markets value debt. They put the number at $5.17 trillion. 
 After the $1.94 trillion set aside in state pension funds was subtracted, there was a gap of $3.23 trillion -- more than three times the amount the states owe their bondholders.
 ''When you see that, you recognize that states are in trouble even more than we recognize,'' Mr. Rauh said. 
 With bond payments and pension contributions consuming big chunks of state budgets, Mr. Rauh said, some states were already falling behind on unsecured debts, like bills from vendors. ''Those are debts, too,'' he said. 
 In Illinois, the state comptroller recently said the state was nearly $9 billion behind on its bills to vendors, which he called an ''ongoing fiscal disaster.'' On Monday, Fitch Ratings downgraded several categories of Illinois's debt, citing the state's accounts payable backlog. California had to pay its vendors with i.o.u.'s last year.
 ''These are the things that can precipitate a crisis,'' Mr. Rauh said.

HEADLINE: The Magic Potion

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
With the marathon effort to overhaul the health care system behind us, it is time for the Obama administration to move quickly and powerfully to the monumental task of putting Americans back to work.
 The just-say-no crowd will insist that we can't afford a real effort to revitalize employment, that budget deficits are too high, that the economy will recover without additional government stimulus, that the president has used up most of his political capital, and that there isn't much that government can do under any circumstances to create jobs.
 Meanwhile, the United States is in real danger of sinking into a long-term economic funk. The recession is not over for the nearly 15 million people who are unemployed. Many of them have been out of work for longer than six months, a seeming eternity. Widespread joblessness and underemployment are threatening to become permanent features of the American landscape, corroding not just our standards of living but the very vibrancy of the American way of life. 
 Poverty and homelessness are increasing. More and more adult children, unable to find work, are living with their parents. The Times's Michael Luowrote in Monday's paper about the increasing phenomenon of workers accepting jobs for which, in terms of their education and experience, they are considered overqualified. 
 Those who think some kind of robust recovery is hiding around the corner, just waiting to spring a pleasant surprise on us, are deluded. Too many families and individuals are tapped out. They're struggling from week to week and month to month just to meet the necessities of housing, food and energy costs. Those crazed, debt-driven buying sprees that held the economy aloft for so long are over.
 Foreclosure notices went out to 2.8 million households last year and that figure is expected to top 3 million this year. Nearly 1 in every 4 homes with mortgages is ''underwater,'' which means that the mortgage holder owes more on the property than it is worth. 
 You can't get back to a robust economy without putting Americans back to work. The economy needs to be rebuilt on a solid foundation of good jobs at good pay, and many of those jobs will have to come from thriving new industries. This is a long-term project that demands big-time government involvement. It will require the kind of commitment -- over an even longer period of time -- that President Obama and the Democrats in Congress gave to their health care initiative.
 Franklin Roosevelt had it right in his first Inaugural Address when he declared, ''Our greatest primary task is to put people to work.'' He underscored the urgency of the task when he said it should be treated ''as we would treat the emergency of a war.''
 The administration and Congressional leaders have been touting some recent legislation as ''jobs bills,'' but they are small-bore initiatives that will accomplish little. What is needed are bold new initiatives on several fronts. The federal government needs to do much more to help state and local governments that are in desperate fiscal straits because of falling tax revenues and are responding by laying off workers and cutting essential services. 
 A long-term program to rebuild the nation's infrastructure (which was only made worse by the harsh winter) would create jobs and establish a sound industrial platform for 21st-century industries.
 The transformation to a greener economy needs to be accelerated, and most of the manufacturing associated with that newer, greener economy should take place in the United States. And some new variation of the Works Progress Administration and the Civilian Conservation Corps should be developed to put economically distressed young people to work. What is happening to young, out-of-work and poorly educated American kids -- not just in the big cities, but increasingly in suburban and rural areas, as well -- is tragic.
 The United States is a rich nation. To say that we cannot afford to do the things necessary to shore up the quality of our lives and establish a brighter future for coming generations is absurd. We always seem to have money for warfare and to bolster the interests of the monied classes.
 As for the budget deficits, they will never be brought under control if Americans are not put back to work. Unemployment drives deficits by depriving the government of tax revenues and dramatically increasing the costs of safety-net programs and other public services. Putting Americans to work will ultimately make it much easier to begin bringing the deficits down.
 The closest thing to a magic potion for individuals, families and the American economy is a job. F.D.R. understood that. The longer it takes for the rest of us to catch on, the deeper the long-term damage to the society will be.

HEADLINE: The Issue Of Liquidity Bubbles Up

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
 ''It's a question of whether you want to insure against a 100-year flood or a 30-year flood.''
 That's the way Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, chatting with me over cookies in his office across from the White House on Friday, described his thinking about the delicate balancing act of financial regulation reform.
 The answer to Mr. Geithner's question will have a huge impact on Wall Street -- specifically, how much money banks are required to keep in their rainy-day accounts. That matters because the more banks hold onto, the less they can lend to growing businesses. 
 Conspicuously absent from any regulatory legislation floating around Capitol Hill is the precise level of capital that banks should hold for every dollar they lend, called a capital ratio. 
 The bill also does not define what can be counted as capital, or how much of that capital should be readily available, known as liquidity. Those questions are being left to the regulators to sort out later.
 Rest assured, though, that when the fight over financial re-regulation is complete, the next big battle between Wall Street and Washington will be over capital ratios and liquidity.
 ''This is the big issue,'' said T. Timothy Ryan Jr., chief executive of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, a trade group. ''There is a natural tension between the banks and regulators on this.'' 
 Of course, protecting against even infrequent crises probably means forcing banks to keep a lot of cash on hand in case their bets go bad. But that would come at the expense of economic growth as banks would make fewer loans. 
 Mr. Geithner insists that if there is one change that needs to be made to the banking system to protect it against another high-stakes bank run like the one that claimed the life of Lehman Brothers, increasing capital requirements is it.
 But try pinning down Mr. Geithner, or anyone else in the Beltway, on how much capital banks should be required to keep, or even how the word ''capital'' should be defined, and certainties disappear. 
 ''We have not made a judgment yet on the number,'' he said, though he allowed, ''it will be higher than where the formal regulatory requirements were coming into the crisis.''
 If it seems that Mr. Geithner is being coy, he has good reason. The debate is fraught with uncertainty, and it extends beyond our borders to other countries grappling with the same question. 
 For banks, where the line is drawn on capital requirements dictates just how profitable they can be. 
 ''A bank, or any financial intermediary, requires significant leverage to be competitive,'' Alan Greenspan, the former Federal Reserve chairman, wrote in a report released this month, referring to borrowed money. 
 He went on: ''Without adequate leverage, markets do not provide a rate of return on financial assets high enough to attract capital to that activity. Yet at too great a degree of leverage, bank solvency is at risk.''
 For borrowers, the exact capital ratio could determine how readily banks can offer mortgages and loans to small businesses. Bankers say that one reason they're not lending as much as policymakers and businesses would like is the uncertainty around how much money they will need to hold onto under whatever rules are set by the government. 
 For now, at least, that's an argument that Mr. Geithner does not buy. ''They certainly are holding more capital than they need now,'' he said, after the government forced most of them to raise capital as part of the stress tests.
 One reason the Obama administration has not tried to propose a one-size-fits-all capital requirement as part of the proposed legislation is the worry that the issue would become too politicized -- that banks would manage to successfully lobby lawmakers for a ratio that is too low, thereby giving investors a false sense of security. 
 Instead, the final number is to be determined by a global coalition of regulators known as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, Mr. Geithner said. 
 ''By the end of this year, we will negotiate an international consensus on the new ratios,'' he said.
 But even then, Mr. Geithner is likely to face a bruising battle, not necessarily from American banks but from their foreign rivals. 
 ''Our major global banks have more capital today relative to risk than do many of their major international competitors,'' Mr. Geithner said.
 In Europe, banks and regulators focus on risk-weighted capital as opposed to pure capital, allowing those banks to keep significantly less collateral on hand for assets that are deemed not very risky, like ultra-safe Treasury bonds. That's not the case in the United States.
 So as the world tries to harmonize its capital ratios and definitions -- a global fix is important so that banks don't try to arbitrage the system -- United States regulators may feel pressure to appease the Europeans by agreeing to lower capital ratios. 
 So how much capital is enough? 
 Mervyn King, the outspoken governor of the Bank of England, has suggested that the level should be roughly double what it was before the crisis hit. (In the United States, precrisis, the ratio for Tier One Common was about 4 percent.) Even Mr. Ryan of the securities trade group says he knows ''it has to go up.''
 And then there is N. Gregory Mankiw, a Harvard professor of economics who was the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President George W. Bush, who recently made a bold suggestion: ''I think it is possible to imagine a bank with almost no leverage at all,'' he wrote on his blog. 
 He continued: ''Suppose we were to require banks to hold 100 percent reserves against demand deposits. And suppose that all bank loans had to be financed 100 percent with bank capital. A bank would, in essence, be a marriage of a super-safe money-market mutual fund with an unlevered finance company.''
 His solution would certainly address Mr. Geithner's musing about insuring against a 100-year storm. But that kind of low-risk, low-reward system would, in one stroke, radically alter our perception of economic prosperity and, indeed, likely create a very different type of storm.

HEADLINE: The Sandra Bullock Trade

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
Two things happened to Sandra Bullock this month. First, she won an Academy Award for best actress. Then came the news reports claiming that her husband is an adulterous jerk. So the philosophic question of the day is: Would you take that as a deal? Would you exchange a tremendous professional triumph for a severe personal blow?
 On the one hand, an Academy Award is nothing to sneeze at. Bullock has earned the admiration of her peers in a way very few experience. She'll make more money for years to come. She may even live longer. Research by Donald A. Redelmeier and Sheldon M. Singh has found that, on average, Oscar winners live nearly four years longer than nominees that don't win. 
 Nonetheless, if you had to take more than three seconds to think about this question, you are absolutely crazy. Marital happiness is far more important than anything else in determining personal well-being. If you have a successful marriage, it doesn't matter how many professional setbacks you endure, you will be reasonably happy. If you have an unsuccessful marriage, it doesn't matter how many career triumphs you record, you will remain significantly unfulfilled.
 This isn't just sermonizing. This is the age of research, so there's data to back this up. Over the past few decades, teams of researchers have been studying happiness. Their work, which seemed flimsy at first, has developed an impressive rigor, and one of the key findings is that, just as the old sages predicted, worldly success has shallow roots while interpersonal bonds permeate through and through.
 For example, the relationship between happiness and income is complicated, and after a point, tenuous. It is true that poor nations become happier as they become middle-class nations. But once the basic necessities have been achieved, future income is lightly connected to well-being. Growing countries are slightly less happy than countries with slower growth rates, according to Carol Graham of the Brookings Institution and Eduardo Lora. The United States is much richer than it was 50 years ago, but this has produced no measurable increase in overall happiness. On the other hand, it has become a much more unequal country, but this inequality doesn't seem to have reduced national happiness.
 On a personal scale, winning the lottery doesn't seem to produce lasting gains in well-being. People aren't happiest during the years when they are winning the most promotions. Instead, people are happy in their 20's, dip in middle age and then, on average, hit peak happiness just after retirement at age 65.
 People get slightly happier as they climb the income scale, but this depends on how they experience growth. Does wealth inflame unrealistic expectations? Does it destabilize settled relationships? Or does it flow from a virtuous cycle in which an interesting job produces hard work that in turn leads to more interesting opportunities?
 If the relationship between money and well-being is complicated, the correspondence between personal relationships and happiness is not. The daily activities most associated with happiness are sex, socializing after work and having dinner with others. The daily activity most injurious to happiness is commuting. According to one study, joining a group that meets even just once a month produces the same happiness gain as doubling your income. According to another, being married produces a psychic gain equivalent to more than $100,000 a year.
 If you want to find a good place to live, just ask people if they trust their neighbors. Levels of social trust vary enormously, but countries with high social trust have happier people, better health, more efficient government, more economic growth, and less fear of crime (regardless of whether actual crime rates are increasing or decreasing).
 The overall impression from this research is that economic and professional success exists on the surface of life, and that they emerge out of interpersonal relationships, which are much deeper and more important.
 The second impression is that most of us pay attention to the wrong things. Most people vastly overestimate the extent to which more money would improve our lives. Most schools and colleges spend too much time preparing students for careers and not enough preparing them to make social decisions. Most governments release a ton of data on economic trends but not enough on trust and other social conditions. In short, modern societies have developed vast institutions oriented around the things that are easy to count, not around the things that matter most. They have an affinity for material concerns and a primordial fear of moral and social ones.
 This may be changing. There is a rash of compelling books -- including ''The Hidden Wealth of Nations'' by David Halpern and ''The Politics of Happiness'' by Derek Bok -- that argue that public institutions should pay attention to well-being and not just material growth narrowly conceived.
 Governments keep initiating policies they think will produce prosperity, only to get sacked, time and again, from their spiritual blind side.

HEADLINE: In Tax Move, A Pushback On Reform

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
An association representing 300 large corporations urged President Obama and Congress on Monday to repeal a provision of the health care overhaul that prompted AT&T, Caterpillar and other companies to announce substantial charges for the current quarter.
 The association, the American Benefits Council, said the provision -- which reduces the tax deductions for companies with drug coverage for their retired employees -- would deal a significant blow to corporate profits and would discourage companies from hiring more workers.
 AT&T announced last week that it was taking a $1 billion charge because of the provision. Deere & Company announced a $150 million charge, Caterpillar a $100 million charge, and 3M a $90 million charge. 
 Many companies said they were taking these charges now, before the current quarter ended, to comply with accounting rules. But some corporate critics asserted that the companies' rapid response to the health legislation was aimed at pressing the administration to repeal the provision.
 James A. Klein, the president of the American Benefits Council, called the provision ''a serious mistake that is having negative and unintended consequences.''
 White House officials defended the provision, saying it was a deliberate effort to eliminate what they said was an unusually generous tax loophole. 
 They said the overall health care overhaul would save businesses more than $150 billion over the next decade by reducing health care inflation.
 ''We're confident that the benefits are going to accrue and strengthen business's bottom line,'' said Linda Douglass, the communications director for the White House Health Reform Office.
 When Congress and President George W. Bush enacted a prescription drug plan for seniors in 2003, the legislation encouraged companies to continue providing prescription coverage to retirees, instead of shifting retirees to Medicare Part D, by having the government give those companies large subsidies for each retiree -- and also allowing them to deduct those subsidies from their income taxes. 
 Under the health care overhaul, the federal government will continue providing those subsidies -- amounting to 28 percent of a drug plan's costs -- but companies will lose the tax break.
 In a telephone news conference on Monday, Mr. Klein cited a study by Towers Watson, a consulting firm, saying the loss of the deduction would cost companies $14 billion in future years. 
 ''Particularly in this economic environment, it makes no sense to impose this type of a hit on companies' financial statements,'' Mr. Klein said. The provision takes effect in 2013, but accounting rules require companies to take immediate charges equal to the current value of any known hit to future profits. 
 Defending the provision, White House officials said it was rare for companies to obtain a tax-free federal subsidy and be able to deduct it as well.
 These officials added that the health care legislation contained a $5 billion subsidy for companies that maintain health plans to early retirees. 
 ''Let's put these changes into perspective,'' Ms. Douglass said. ''While accounting rules required companies to book this cost upfront, there are a whole set of benefits that will accrue to companies over time that they're not booking upfront.''
 Federal officials estimate that the provision will raise $4.5 billion to $5 billion in revenue over 10 years, but Mr. Klein maintained that it would cost the government more than it raised. 
 About 6.3 million retirees -- an estimated two-thirds of them from the private sector -- are covered by employer drug plans. Mr. Klein cited a study by the Moran Company, a health care consulting group, estimating that as a result of the legislation, drug coverage would be altered for 1.5 million to 2 million retirees. 
 Many companies, he said, will stop providing drug coverage to retirees and will instead push them into Medicare Part D, causing the government to pay for their coverage.
 AT&T said in a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission, ''As a result of this legislation, including the additional tax burden, AT&T will be evaluating prospective changes to the active and retiree health care benefits offered by the company.''
 Henry A. Waxman, a California Democrat who is chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, criticized the charges by the companies, asserting that the health reform would save companies more money than it cost them. 
 Mr. Waxman sent AT&T, Caterpillar and Deere a sharp letter, questioning the charges and saying he wanted top officials from those companies to testify at an April 21 hearing he has scheduled on the issue.
 Mr. Waxman and Bart Stupak, a Michigan Democrat who is chairman of the House Commerce Committee's subcommittee on oversight and investigations, wrote to AT&T's chairman, Randall L. Stephenson, ''The new law is designed to expand coverage and bring down costs, so your assertions are a matter of concern.'' 
 Their letter said AT&T's moves ''appear to conflict with independent analyses,'' including a finding by the Business Roundtable, an association of chief executives, that health care reform would reduce insurance cost trends for businesses by more than $3,000 for each employee over the next 10 years.
 Responding to such criticism, Mr. Klein said: ''These announcements are required under accounting rules, and we should all expect more of such announcements in coming days and weeks. We're very troubled that these announcements have been challenged by officials in Obama administration and Congress.'' 
 Many employer plans for retiree drug coverage are part of union contracts. In December, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s legislative director, Bill Samuel, joined Mr. Klein in writing to Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader, urging the Senate not to enact this provision.
 Gerry Shea, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s chief strategist on health care, stopped short of calling for a repeal of the provision. ''We're very concerned about the disruption that could be caused because of this, with people being pushed out of employer plans,'' he said. ''With all the changes we're looking at because of the new health legislation, we feel you don't need this.''
 Mr. Klein argued that the provision would undercut Mr. Obama's job creation plans. ''If companies are going to take a hit like this on their financial statements that will certainly hurt their ability to borrow in the marketplace and make the type of investments that will retain and create jobs,'' he said.
 But White House officials said the provision would not affect job creation because it does not take effect for three years and any charge for a given year would not be large.

MOSCOW -- The brazen suicide bombings in the center of Moscow confronted Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin with a grave challenge to his record of curbing terrorism, and raised the possibility that he would respond as he had in the past, by significantly tightening control over the government.
 The explosions Monday, set off by female suicide bombers in two landmark subway stations, killed at least 38 people and wounded scores of others, touching off fears that the Muslim insurgency in southern Russia, including Chechnya, was once again being brought to the country's heart. 
 The attacks during the morning rush hour seemed all but designed to taunt the security services, which have been championed by Mr. Putin in the decade since he took power in Russia. The first one occurred at the Lubyanka subway station, next to the headquarters of the Federal Security Service, also known as the F.S.B., the successor agency to the Soviet-era K.G.B. that was led by Mr. Putin in the late 1990s.
 Mr. Putin, the former president and still Russia's paramount leader, has built his reputation in part on his success in bottling up the Muslim insurgency in southern Russia and preventing major terrorist attacks in the country's population centers in recent years. If the bombings on Monday herald a renewed campaign by insurgents in major cities, then that legacy may be tarnished.
 The attacks could also throw into doubt the policies of Mr. Putin's protege, President Dmitri A. Medvedev, who has spoken in favor of liberalizing the government, increasing political pluralism and dealing with terrorism by addressing the root causes of the insurgency.
 While Mr. Medvedev has not yet put in place many major changes, Mr. Putin has generally allowed him to pursue his course. More terrorism, though, could cause Mr. Putin to shove Mr. Medvedev aside and move the security-oriented circle of advisers around Mr. Putin to the forefront.
 ''Putin said, 'One thing that I definitely accomplished was this,' and he didn't,'' said Pavel K. Baev, a Russian who is a professor at the International Peace Research Institute in Oslo.
 ''My feeling is this is not an isolated attack, that we will see more,'' Mr. Baev said. ''If we are facing a situation where there is a chain of attacks, that would undercut every attempt to soften, liberalize, open up, and increase the demand for tougher measures.''
 Mr. Putin on Monday limited his comments largely to vows to destroy the terrorists who organized the attacks, who have not been identified, but who the Russian authorities said they suspect came from Chechnya or neighboring regions in the Caucasus Mountains. But when he last faced a spate of such violence, in 2004, he reacted with a sweeping reorganization of the government that he said would unite the country against terrorism, but also concentrated power in the Kremlin.
 He pushed through laws that eliminated the direct election of regional governors, turning them into presidential appointees, and made it all but impossible for political independents to be elected to the federal Parliament. He also increased the strength of the security services.
 Boris I. Makarenko, chairman of the Center for Political Technologies in Moscow, a research organization, cautioned that it was too soon to speculate whether Mr. Putin might feel the need to clamp down. Mr. Makarenko said he believed that Mr. Putin's reputation had not suffered badly because of terrorist attacks early in his tenure as president.
 But Mr. Makarenko noted that the bombings in the Moscow subway came as Russia's financial problems had been agitating the government. Protests have broken out in some major cities, and the opposition, while still relatively weak, has been gaining some support.
 ''The public has become more skeptical about the government in general in recent months, due to the government's limited ability to tackle the effects of the economic crisis, to the inefficiency and misbehavior of the police, and other issues,'' he said. ''These terrorist attacks might be another piece in the efforts of those who want to go after the government.''
 The subway system in Moscow is one of the world's most extensive and well managed, and the bombings on Monday spread anxiety that is unlikely to dissipate for some time. For many people here, the day's events recalled the tense times in the early part of the last decade when the city, including the subway, was hit with several terrorist attacks.
 While the Muslim insurgency has not subsided in recent years, major attacks outside the Caucasus region had been unusual, and in April 2009, the Kremlin even announced what it described as the end of special counterterrorism operations in Chechnya.
 But in November 2009, terrorists bombed a luxury passenger train that was traveling in a rural area from Moscow to St. Petersburg, killing 26 people. Last month, a Chechen rebel leader, Doku Umarov, threatened in an interview on a Web site to organize terror acts in Russian population centers.
 ''If Russians think that the war is happening only on television, somewhere far off in the Caucasus, and it will not touch them, then we are going to show them that this war will return to their homes,'' he said.
 Mr. Medvedev, who took office in 2008, has called for a somewhat different tack on the insurgency, saying that the government should aggressively hunt down the terrorists, but also focus on the poverty and government malfeasance that he contended nurtured extremism.
 Last June, Mr. Medvedev visited the region and gave an unusual speech in which he seemed to offer an implicit rebuff to the uncompromising Putin strategy.
 ''It is no secret to anyone here that these problems in the North Caucasus, and in the south of our country in general, are systemic,'' Mr. Medvedev said. ''By saying that, I am referring to the low living standards, high unemployment and massive, horrifyingly widespread corruption.''
 Mr. Medvedev also appointed a new leader of Ingushetia, a Muslim region, who echoed his belief that hard-line measures would only stir a backlash.
 On Monday, though, some senior members of Mr. Putin's party, United Russia, were already suggesting that the government needed to adopt a stern new plan to combat terrorism.
 Vladimir A. Vasilyev, chairman of the security committee in Parliament, lashed out at law-enforcement authorities, saying that they should be punished for allowing the attack.
 ''I am convinced that all those who failed to carry out their duty will bear responsibility,'' he said, adding that current laws were ''ineffective.''
 For his part, Mr. Medvedev voiced only a determination to catch those behind the attacks. ''We will continue our counterterrorist operations with unflinching resolve until we have defeated this scourge,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Endless Summer, Even In Maine

BYLINE: By CHRIS LADD

DATELINE: Madison, Me. 

 BODY:
 AN icy mixture of rain and sleet fell on the glass roof of Greenhouse Two at Backyard Farms here, but as its big blue door slid open and the warm, green, celery smell of tomato plants wafted out, it was summer.
 When it was built three years ago, the company's first 24-acre greenhouse in Madison was already the largest building in Maine. This second connected greenhouse, completed last year, brought the total area under glass to some 42 acres, or roughly the size of 32 football fields. Even in the depths of winter, a million tomatoes ripen indoors to harvest each week, snipped from their vines by workers in T-shirts and shorts. 
 ''It's medium sized,'' said Tim de Kok, one of the company's head growers. At his last job, Mr. de Kok managed a 40-acre chunk of a 318-acre monster in Arizona. The center of Canada's greenhouse industry, the area around Leamington, Ontario, has some 1,600 covered acres, roughly equivalent to putting Manhattan, south of Houston Street, under glass.
 Once, if you wanted tomatoes out of season, you mainly had to settle for hard pink ones picked green in the fields of Florida or Mexico and shipped by truck. Commercial greenhouses could do better, but they were a niche market. 
 Backed by consumer demand for fresh tomatoes year round, the indoor acreage devoted to growing tomatoes has become nearly six times as large since the early 1990s, said Roberta Cook, a marketing economist who helped write what many in the industry consider to be the definitive report on greenhouse tomatoes in 2005. 
 Those tough pink ones are still good and cheap enough for most fast food restaurants and the food service industry, which buy about half the fresh tomatoes sold in the United States. But with shoppers willing to pay a premium -- even $4 to $5 a pound -- for red vine-ripened ones with more flavor, greenhouse tomatoes now represent more than half of every dollar spent on fresh tomatoes in American supermarkets, according to figures from the Perishables Group, a market research firm in Chicago. 
 ''In the U.S., it's hard to be competitive without a 20-acre minimum block,'' Ms. Cook said. 
 The plants here at Backyard Farms number about 550,000. Each consists of two plants -- the vines of new varieties, constantly tweaked for flavor, color, freshness and myriad other traits; and the roots of another, grafted together at a thickly scarred ''V'' near the base. 
 One half grows down into a sterile dirt-substitute made from fibers spun out of volcanic basalt, absorbing a custom hydroponic cocktail mixed by Mr. de Kok. The other half stretches toward the glass ceiling, growing a foot every week along a nine-foot length of twine. When the plants reach the top, workers reel more twine from the spool, shift the entire row horizontally and band each vine to its neighbor so that by the end of a plant's life it might grow parallel to the concrete floor for as many as 20 or 30 feet, a dozen vines tangled together like garden hoses, before each makes its own graceful turn upward.
 ''It's like a bonsai tree -- you have to treat every plant exactly the same,'' Mr. de Kok said. ''As soon as it gets uneven, that's when it starts to get away from you.''
 He sat at his desk with three monitors recording temperature data, carbon dioxide levels, light readings measured in joules per square meter, and countless other figures from sensors scattered throughout the glass building. 
 To compete in a more crowded market, where increased supply eroded price, many exploit technology to scramble for tomorrow's hot tomato.
 ''There is a tremendous variety of tomatoes available, thousands of cultivars,'' said Tom Papadopoulos, a senior research scientist at Canada's Greenhouse and Processing Crops Research Centre in Harrow, Ontario. 
 In the mid '90s, beefsteaks were the dominant contributor to greenhouse revenue. Then it was tomatoes sold on the vine, the principal crop at Backyard Farms. They are medium-size fruit, round and firm, and are sold in clusters of four to six. 
 Today, as tomatoes on the vine grow commonplace, many companies are going small -- cherry tomatoes, or grape, or campari, larger than cherry and smaller than tomatoes on the vine. Backyard Farms recently introduced a new line of cocktail tomatoes on the vine, similar in size to Camparis and sold in clusters of eight and packaged in cartons like Tomato McNuggets.
 ''They've got strawberry tomatoes in greenhouses now -- that's a special variety that also has great flavor,'' Ms. Cook said. ''What I find is the smaller ones tend to be the good ones.''
 While the diversification is industrywide, the ability to grow many generations of greenhouse plants in a single season allows breeders to introduce those varieties more quickly, Mr. Papadopoulos said. Advances in genetics have allowed breeders to cross-pollinate precisely for control over specific attributes like size, color, disease resistance, firmness for shipping and levels of acids and sugars, the balance of which accounts for the bulk of a tomato's flavor. Too little sugar turns fruit tart. Too little acid turns it bland. Too little of both leaves tomatoes with little flavor. 
 As tomatoes ripen on the vine they develop more of those sugars and acids and other flavor elements. But most of the major farms growing tomatoes that are sold fresh year round are in areas where the climate is more hospitable to varieties best picked green. 
 By creating their own climate -- whether in Arizona, Maine or Canada -- greenhouses allow growers to pick and ship tomatoes only when they're ripe.
 That's a major advantage. And while no one would mistake a Backyard Beauty for a tomato picked from a backyard in late summer -- it is not as tender and its flavor is not as complex -- it is juicier and has much more flavor than what you'd find in your deli sandwich.
 ''They don't make a tomato that my grandmother would have liked,'' Mr. Papadopoulos said. ''They make a tomato that my son would like or my daughter would like.''
 Some of the technical advances that have allowed for these changes don't even seem like technology.
 Twenty years ago, the millions of blossoms on these vines would all have been pollinated by hand, electric vibrators shaking pollen loose from anther to pistil every 48 hours. Today, that work is done by bees, shipped in cardboard hives from Michigan that are stacked seven high at the end of the rows.
 Aphids, when they're found, are kept in check by a small species of wasp, no bigger than a flying ant, that lays its eggs in the pest's larvae. 
 Lately, the greenhouse has been experimenting with interplanting young plants alongside older ones so that when one generation is discarded, the next is already yielding fruit. The aim is a continuous flow of production, tomatoes ripening fully on the vine year round and landing in outlets as far away as Maryland within 24 hours of harvest. 
 ''Continuous production cycles, that is important now as the market becomes more competitive,'' Mr. Papadopoulos said. ''If they're out of production for two months, people who buy tomatoes will go somewhere else, and maybe they will forget to come back.'' 
 For instance, the majority of growers in Canada's greenhouse capital, Leamington, are unable to produce the year round because, experts say, there simply isn't enough light to grow tomatoes there profitably in midwinter. 
 Backyard Farms is some 130 miles farther north of that Canadian city. To compensate, it employs some 20,000 high-pressure sodium lights, fueled by cheap power from Madison's town-owned hydroelectric plant. Switched on, the lights use as much electricity in 32 minutes as the average American household does in a year. Some of its 200 employees wear sunglasses.
 The environmental costs of pouring so many resources into a tomato is a touchy subject. Backyard Farms' chief executive, Roy Lubetkin, when pressed, pointed to biological controls like the wasps that allow the company to grow tomatoes without pesticides, and to the four-acre reservoir of reclaimed rain runoff that supplies, almost exclusively, their irrigation water. And because there is no dirt at Backyard Farms, fruit needn't be washed. 
 ''It's real sunlight, it's real rainwater, these are real bees,'' he said. ''What we're really doing is allowing nature to do its thing.'' But which is greener, a field tomato shipped to Maine from Florida or one grown in-state in a greenhouse? ''We're redder,'' he said. 
 Across from the four-acre reservoir of recycled runoff, hidden from the road, are three very large propane tanks that serve a boiler system that keeps temperatures hovering around 70 degrees year round. 
 Two enormous tanks, filled with carbon dioxide, stand on end beside them. The gas, fed along the vines in perforated plastic bags, adds bulk to the fruit and speeds growth. The tanks suggest that greenhouse tomatoes, while delicious, aren't particularly green. 
 Such were the findings of a 2005 study by the British government that compared the ecological footprints of tomatoes grown locally in heated greenhouses with those grown in fields and imported from Spain. Even taking into account emissions from an additional 700 miles of shipping, the local greenhouse tomatoes were still responsible for emitting nearly four times more greenhouse gases than the imported fruit. Barring some advance in heating or lighting, or possibly even in the tomatoes themselves, such is the cost of perpetual summer.
 Inside at Backyard Farms, the bees zip around the crates, workers and tomato vines that stretch on to the faint glass horizon. Through a door at the end of Greenhouse Two, palettes of tomatoes are boxed and ready to be loaded onto a truck. On this morning, they were suspended from their vines. By this time tomorrow, they'll be back indoors, under supermarket lights.

HEADLINE: Volcker Optimistic for Financial Revamping This Year

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The White House and one of its top outside economic advisers, Paul A. Volcker, expressed confidence on Tuesday that legislation to overhaul the nation's financial system would be completed this year, possibly before the Congressional summer recess. 
 ''I feel more optimistic than I would have felt a month or two ago,'' Mr. Volcker, who was chairman of the Federal Reserve from 1979 to 1987, said in a speech here at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
 Asked about reports that the Senate might move on the legislation by the end of May, the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, said, ''I don't think that's an unrealistic timetable at all.'' 
 The House passed a sweeping financial reform package in December, and the Senate Banking Committee did so last week, on a party-line vote. But Democrats would have to obtain some Republican support to overcome the potential threat of a filibuster in the Senate.
 ''The president is clear that we are not going to compromise on what we believe represents a very strong piece of legislation,'' Mr. Gibbs said, adding that President Obama was committed to provisions that include a consumer financial protection agency. 
 The comments by Mr. Gibbs and Mr. Volcker reflected a new optimism about the prospect for the legislation, which is intended to prevent a recurrence of the conditions that led to the 2008 financial crisis and the government bailouts that followed.
 Mr. Volcker, who has been one of the chief advocates for overhauling financial regulations, said the bill approved by the Senate Banking Committee represented a ''framework for getting agreement this year.'' 
 In his speech, Mr. Volcker was critical of the broad growth in the financial services industry in recent decades. Finance came to represent an ever-greater share of corporate profits, even as average earnings for most American workers did not rise.
 ''The question that really jumps out for me is, given all that data, whether the enormous gains in the financial sector -- in compensation and profits -- reflect the relative contributions that sector has made to the growth of human welfare,'' Mr. Volcker said.
 He also asked whether the financial sector contributed to underlying imbalances in the economy, as Americans raided their savings and relied on a housing bubble to maintain excessively high consumption levels. 
 Mr. Volcker also warned that the government bailouts had left a huge ''moral hazard'' problem. 
 ''There is an expectation that very large and complicated financial institutions will not be allowed to fail,'' he said. ''Unless that conviction is shaken, the natural result is that risk-taking will be encouraged and in fact subsidized beyond reasonable limits.''
 The bills being debated in Congress would put responsibility for managing systemic financial risks in the hands of a council of regulators. Mr. Volcker said he was ''a little skeptical'' about the efficiency and effectiveness of giving that responsibility to such a council, but suggested that the idea could be made to work.

HEADLINE: Adjustments Are Masking Troubling Housing Trends

BYLINE: By DAVID STREITFELD

 BODY:
Housing prices are still inching up, but few analysts are presuming the trend will last.
 The Standard & Poor's Case-Shiller Index rose a seasonally adjusted 0.3 percent in January, from December, according to data released Tuesday. It was the eighth consecutive monthly increase. 
 But what appeared to be good news in the widely watched measure masked underlying troubles. The discrepancy is because of seasonal adjustments, which in theory smooth out the data. In the slow-selling winter months, seasonal adjustments lift the numbers; in the summer, the opposite happens. 
 On an unadjusted basis, the index fell 0.4 percent in January from December, extending a pattern of decline.
 ''We're seeing a general weakening,'' said Maureen Maitland, vice president for index services at Standard & Poor's.
 House sales rose in the fall as buyers and sellers eagerly did deals before the government's $8,000 tax credit was scheduled to end Nov. 30. Congress then extended the credit until April 30, but the momentum was lost, and sales volume plunged.
 Other housing indexes, which use different sets of data from different communities, show that the last few months have been hard on home prices. 
 The First American CoreLogic Home Price Index dropped 1.9 percent in January, double its decline in December. The Federal Housing Finance Agency's index dropped 0.6 percent in January after falling a revised 2 percent in December. Analysts said that Case-Shiller would eventually slide as well. 
 ''It is only a matter of time before the index records a double-dip in prices,'' Paul Dales of Capital Economics said.
 In the meantime, the spread between the raw numbers and the adjusted numbers is getting wider. Cleveland, for instance, rose 0.7 percent on an adjusted basis in January. But the raw numbers showed a 0.7 percent decline.
 ''In a normal market, seasonal patterns are the same every year,'' said Ms. Maitland of S.& P. ''In a stressed market with a lot of foreclosures, that predictability is being lost.'' 
 The housing market bottomed last winter. On an annual basis, the Case-Shiller index is now off less than 1 percent. Prices are down about 30 percent from the peak in the summer of 2006.
 Twelve of the cities in the index went up in January from December. The West Coast continued to show a pattern of strength, despite the fact that its cities are generally more expensive and therefore the influence of the government tax credit was presumably less.
 Los Angeles was the biggest gainer, up 1.7 percent. San Diego was up 0.9 percent and San Francisco rose 0.6 percent. Chicago was the biggest loser, dropping 0.8 percent.
 With the January 2010 data now published, it is possible to track the best and worst cities to have owned real estate over the century's first decade.
 The three best cities are no surprise: Los Angeles, New York and Washington. All are more than 70 percent above their level in January 2000.
 Anyone who bought in Las Vegas would have lost a few dollars after paying their agent's commission. But the worst-performing city in the index was Detroit, which ended the decade 28 percent below where it began.

HEADLINE: Past Failure A Lesson in Success

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN

 BODY:
DAYTON, Ohio -- Three years later, the newspaper photograph remains in Tina Charles's locker at Connecticut. The picture reminds her of being torched as a freshman by Louisiana State's Sylvia Fowles in the 2007 N.C.A.A. tournament. More broadly, it is a daily admonition against complacency.
 ''I shouldn't be comfortable,'' the 6-foot-4 Charles said of the photograph's harsh inspiration. ''There's somebody else who's always going out to take your spot or who's working harder.''
 She has since developed into the nation's top center and a favorite to be named the national women's player of the year. On Tuesday night, Charles provided steadiness after Maya Moore drew two early fouls, scoring 20 points and grabbing 14 rebounds as the Huskies (37-0) extended their winning streak to 76 games and advanced again to the Final Four with an 90-50 victory over Florida State in the final of the Dayton Regional. 
 ''Tina was always physically gifted,'' her teammate Kalana Greene, a senior guard, said. ''The last two years, mentally she's gotten a lot stronger. No one ever doubted how talented Tina was. They just doubted if she could play in the big games. The last few years she's been huge in every big game we ever had.''
 Now comes one of the biggest challenges that Charles has ever faced. On Sunday in the national semifinals in San Antonio, UConn will meet Baylor and its transforming 6-8 freshman center Brittney Griner, who has set a tournament record with 35 blocked shots, including 14 against Georgetown and 10 against Tennessee.
 ''I like her game a lot,'' Charles said. ''She has so much growth left. That was the same thing with me my freshman year.''
 It will be fascinating to see how UConn attempts to counter Griner's disruptive presence. Though Charles, who has averaged 18.3 points, 9.3 rebounds, 4.9 assists and 2.2 blocks this season, is four inches shorter than Griner, she is faster, more mobile and experienced, deft on offense with either hand and able to score inside and outside.
 ''The thing about Tina is she's stronger, she runs amazingly well rim to rim and positions herself so well to get the ball,'' said Iowa State Coach Bill Fennelly, whose team lost to UConn in the regional semifinals and defeated Baylor during Big 12 play. ''The game looks almost easy. The term we use is economy of motion. Brittney Griner's got to catch her to guard her.''
 UConn may find success in moving Charles away from the basket and forcing Griner to guard her in the open floor, a tactic Iowa State used, Fennelly said. 
 ''Brittney Griner changes the game, but I'd be surprised from what I've seen if Baylor can compete with them for 40 minutes,'' he said.
 Rebecca Lobo, a star on UConn's 1995 championship team, said that Charles might use her resourcefulness to take the ball right at Griner. ''Brittney has not been getting into foul trouble, but she's still a freshman,'' Lobo said.
 A prime UConn advantage is that it can score reliably from every position, while youthful Baylor has been spotty from the perimeter and susceptible to the kind of pressure defense that the Huskies apply.
 ''I don't know that there's any team capable of dealing with Brittney Griner at this stage,'' UConn Coach Geno Auriemma said. ''She's going to get 25 points, block 10 shots; that's the way it is. You might have to concede that spot and hope the other guys don't kill you. When they've struggled, it's because they didn't make shots on the perimeter.''
 These are the moments that Charles has relished since she arrived at UConn from Christ the King High in New York City and told Auriemma, ''I want to be great.''
 Yet she seemed immature as a freshman, more of a follower than a leader, not willing to take responsibility, Auriemma said. Perhaps she had an inflated sense of her skill having grown up in New York, he said.
 ''New York players have more baggage than Delta,'' he said.
 Charles's freshman season ended humbly as she shot 0 for 5 from the field and managed a point against L.S.U. in a 73-50 defeat in the final of the 2007 Fresno Regional. The 6-6 Fowles dominated her with 23 points, 15 rebounds and 6 blocked shots.
 ''The last time I've seen her not really compete was when she played Fowles,'' Greene said of Charles. ''Tina wants a challenge every day.''
 Her sophomore season ended unexpectedly with UConn's last defeat -- a loss to Stanford in the 2008 national semifinals. Last season, Auriemma reminded Charles of her stated goal of becoming an all-American. She had not really lifted her game, and he chided her, saying: ''They didn't give it to you last year, but now they're going to feel sorry for you and give it to you this year? It doesn't work that way.''
 She began playing more assertively as the 2008-9 season progressed, and as the N.C.A.A. tournament began, Auriemma told his team: ''If Tina Charles plays like an all-American, we're going to win this whole thing. It doesn't matter what any of you other guys do.''
 Spurred by her coach's remarks, Charles was named most valuable player of the Final Four as UConn won its sixth national title. This season, Charles picked up where she left off.
 ''More importantly, she's grown as a person,'' Auriemma said.
 Earlier this semester, Charles worked four days a week at a corrections facility near the UConn campus, attending counseling sessions for college credit, assisting inmates as they prepared to re-enter society.
 ''I believe everybody deserves a second chance,'' Charles said. ''I don't see why individuals can't forgive if God forgives.''
 She, too, has gotten a second chance, even though on the court is one thing and in the courts is quite another. The photograph in her locker serves as a constant nudge away from lethargy toward vigor.
 ''I always knew I could be there for big games,'' Charles said. ''It's just about doing it on a consistent basis.''

HEADLINE: Plan to Decentralize Haiti

BYLINE: By NICOLAI OUROUSSOFF

 BODY:
Even as outsiders feel sympathy for Haiti's suffering, they tend to look upon it as a country beyond saving. 
 Now there is a plan to do just that, and it is surprisingly convincing. The lucid, far-reaching reconstruction guidelines that the Haitian government is scheduled to unveil on Wednesday at a donors' conference at the United Nations should give all who care about Haiti's future cause for hope.
Prepared by a group of urban planners from the Haitian government agency responsible for the country's development, the plan is built around a bold central idea: to redistribute large parts of the population of Port-au-Prince to smaller Haitian cities, many of them at a safe distance from areas most vulnerable to natural disaster. In the process the plan would completely transform Haiti from a country dominated by a single metropolis to what the planners call a network of smaller urban ''growth poles.'' 
 The guidelines are still in a nascent stage, and Haiti's fate will ultimately have a lot to do with economic and political developments beyond the scope of planners. But the guidelines already surpass any of the early reconstruction plans for post-Hurricane Katrina New Orleans or for the parts of Asia affected by the tsunami in 2004. The guidelines' well-reasoned thinking about environmental threats and the history of urban development in Haiti suggests that they could become a reliable blueprint not just for reconstruction, but also for solving many of the urban ills that have plagued the country for decades. 
 The causes of those troubles can be traced back a century. Haiti was once primarily rural, with its major economic activity distributed among several ports along the northern, western and southern coasts. But after the United States invaded in 1915, the Americans began to concentrate most trade operations in Port-au-Prince, the site of their military headquarters. The port was dredged to make room for big new steamships; other major ports, to the north and west, began to lose their importance. By the middle of the 1960s, Francois Duvalier had shut down the other ports entirely as part of an effort to concentrate his power base in the capital.
 The growth of Port-au-Prince accelerated in the political turmoil after Duvalier's son and heir, Jean-Claude, fled the country in 1986. Over the next 20 years, the city's population nearly doubled, to close to three million people, according to some estimates.
 The effect of this shift was an urban disaster -- one that has put more and more pressure on the capital while draining the provinces of economic opportunity. 
 ''You need to restore a balance,'' said Leslie Voltaire, an urban planner and a special envoy to the United Nations, in an interview on Tuesday. ''If we don't do anything, Port-au-Prince is expected to grow to 6,000,000 in the next 15 years. It will become an incubator for further crime and violence. Our economic advantage is in agriculture and tourism, and these are by nature decentralized.'' 
 The notion of shrinking the capital and reviving provincial cities dates back to 1987. It was enshrined as a goal in the post-Duvalier constitution by a government seeking to redistribute political power and has been brought up periodically by urban planners ever since, to little effect. 
 The environmental and geological concerns raised by the earthquake have made this approach seem all the more critical. Geologists point out that the dangers posed by the fault line running across Port-au-Prince are compounded by others, like landslides and flooding. 
 In essence, the guidelines treat the recent disaster as an opportunity. Thousands of public buildings in Port-au-Prince were destroyed by the earthquake, including schools, hospitals and markets. Around 600,000 survivors have since fled the capital for cities like Cap Haitien, in the north, and Hinche, in the central plateau. The population of Gonaives, a port city on the west coast roughly midway between the country's two major fault lines, has swollen to 300,000 from 200,000 in less than three months.
 By relocating many schools and hospitals to smaller cities, planners hope to create an economic incentive to keep people from returning to Port-au-Prince once reconstruction begins. The new buildings could be organized around public squares and parks to provide civic centers to communities sorely lacking in them.
 Planners have outlined a similar approach for rural villages, with farms encircling a communal core containing a market, a school and health-care facilities. The public structures would be built by the government; much of the housing could be put up privately by Haitians but under stricter building regulations. (Mr. Voltaire even imagines a prototype for basic shelter that could be transformed into a more permanent house over time.) 
 ''This will only work if these poles become magnets of attraction -- with agriculture, tourism, industry and especially jobs,'' Mr. Voltaire said. ''Otherwise, these people are going to come back.''
 If they do return, it will be to a Port-au-Prince that was already stretched beyond capacity before the quake. International aid organizations invested heavily in the city's infrastructure in the 1970s, building sewers and expanding the electrical network, but there has been almost no investment since. Sewage treatment facilities are more or less nonexistent. The city's building code is barely two pages long.
 The guidelines could lead to new zoning regulations that would at least begin to segregate residential from commercial activities in some of the densest downtown areas. A light rail system, running on a north-south axis through the city center, would help relieve traffic congestion. The millions of cubic tons of debris resulting from the earthquake would be used as landfill at the water's edge, creating room for a waterfront park in a city in dire need of public space. Sites that were once occupied by schools and hospitals that have been moved out of town would be turned into other parks and public squares.
 ''The best thing that could happen is to insert public spaces -- new parks, squares, exchange centers, markets -- into these voids,'' Mr. Voltaire said. ''We should think in terms of the city's urban evolution rather than large-scale development.'' 
 More than a few of the renderings at this early stage suggest conventional planning formulas found in Southern California, suburban Boston or Beijing. But what matters is the underlying principles that inform the guidelines and that treat the reconstruction effort as an opportunity to build community.
 What Haiti's planners will need next is not just money, but also access to ideas. Mr. Voltaire and a group of Haitian planners spent several days last week refining their plan at the University of Miami, for example. The institution's faculty and students provided much-needed logistical support, helping to produce maps and renderings. It was also an opportunity for the university, a stronghold of New Urbanism, to promote that movement's small-town planning philosophy. 
 In New York the architect Steven Holl recently completed a proposal for urban reconstruction, though he has had no direct contact with the Haitian government. In contrast to the New Urbanist model, his proposal, though few have seen it, favors urban density over suburbanization. 
 I've had reservations about New Urbanist theory in the past. But the point is that those who are planning Haiti's reconstruction should have access to the widest range of talent and ideas. International development authorities could set up such a framework. Haiti can then determine the best fit for itself. 
 This will not be an easy task. Americans may remember the good will that swirled around New Orleans in the months after Hurricane Katrina. Architects and planners, moved by what they saw, churned out plans for the city's recovery. Some of these plans -- environmentally sensitive, rooted in a knowledge of New Orleans and its racial and social tensions -- could have formed the foundation for something of genuine value. But a connection between good urban planning ideas and political realities on the ground was never made. The best plans went nowhere. Let's pray that doesn't happen in Haiti.

HEADLINE: Ireland Lays Out a Broad Plan to Help Rescue Its Banks

BYLINE: By MATTHEW SALTMARSH

 BODY:
Ireland announced sweeping measures on Tuesday to tighten control over the financial sector, which has been hurt by the global economic crisis and the collapse of the Irish real estate market.
 In a series of announcements, the financial authorities said the government would take control of two thrift institutions, inject funds into other banks and take over a wide range of problem assets at the main lenders.
 ''The Irish banking sector is now effectively nationalized,'' said Brian Lucey, an associate professor of finance at Trinity College Dublin. ''This was the inevitable outcome, but why has it taken a year to get to this?'' 
 ''It will take years to unwind,'' Mr. Lucey said.
 The Irish finance minister, Brian Lenihan, told Parliament that the government would take control of the mortgage lender Irish Nationwide Building Society and try to sell it or merge it with another entity. It will also take over a second thrift, the EBS Building Society, through a capital injection, which will give the government ''extensive powers and full economic ownership'' of the lender.
 In addition, Dublin will provide 8 billion euros ($10.7 billion) in capital support this week to the Anglo Irish Bank, which was nationalized last year. Anglo Irish might require an additional 10 billion euros later, Mr. Lenihan said.
 Another lender, Allied Irish Banks, must sell assets in Britain, Poland and the United States, he said, adding that the government could subsequently convert its existing preferential shares. That process might be enough to give the government full control and would leave the Bank of Ireland as the only viable private-sector lender in Ireland. 
 The finance minister said the Bank of Ireland needed to raise 2.7 billion euros in equity from private sources by the end of the year to meet capital standards.
 Separately, the government's National Asset Management Agency, established last year to buy and resell problem loans, said that it would acquire more than 1,200 individual loans from the five main lenders, for 8.5 billion euros, representing an average discount of 47 percent to a nominal value of 16 billion euros.
 It will take 10 billion euros from Anglo Irish Bank; 3.3 billion euros from Allied Irish Banks; 1.9 billion euros from Bank of Ireland; and less than 1 billion euros from the two thrifts.
 The agency was established as a so-called bad bank to absorb additional troubled assets at a deep discount. Its structure was approved by the European Commission a month ago. A presentation on the agency's Web site shows that it envisions taking over 77.1 billion euros in loans at a discount from the five institutions.
 Brendan McDonagh, chief executive of the asset management agency, said in a statement that borrowers whose loans had been acquired would be required to submit a business plan within a month outlining how they proposed to honor the loans.
 The agency will then monitor the borrower's subsequent performance to ensure they adhere to the goals contained in the approved business plans. If the plans are not followed, the agency ''will take whatever actions it considers necessary to protect the interests of the taxpayer,'' he said.
 The government hoped that the announcements would end months of uncertainty among investors about the viability of Irish lenders. It is not clear, though, that it will placate taxpayers angry about paying for the banks' problems.
 ''We are facing up to our banking difficulties,'' Mr. Lenihan said. ''We have acknowledged the scale of our problems, and we have taken the necessary actions to solve them.
 ''This government, on behalf of the taxpayer, has committed the capital that will ensure we have a banking system to serve this economy as it recovers.''

HEADLINE: There's a Fight Inside the School Cafeteria

BYLINE: By KIM SEVERSON

 BODY:
IT'S been an unusually tough month for the people who make school lunches.
 Friday night, more than seven million viewers watched the premiere of ''Jamie Oliver's Food Revolution,'' an ABC reality series in which the British chef storms the kitchens of Huntington, W.Va., to improve the town's collective diet.
 That only the N.C.A.A. Division I men's basketball tournament pulled in more viewers signals that the nation has an appetite for the kind of wholesale food reform Mr. Oliver is pushing. 
 To the chagrin of cafeteria workers everywhere, his star villains are the town's lunch ladies -- or the ''lovely girls'' as he calls them. They ended up looking so bad that the national School Nutrition Association followed up with a press release in their defense. 
 That wasn't the only recent public thrashing for the people who make school food. Students in Chicago showed up at a Board of Education meeting to protest the quality of their midday meals. And members of the national news media discovered the ''Fed Up with Lunch'' blog, written by an anonymous school employee in the Midwest who is spending a year eating and publishing photos of awful-looking food at her school cafeteria.
 In Washington, where Michelle Obama's anti-obesity campaign continues to point a finger at the school lunch line, a Senate committee on March 24 cut by more than half a proposal by President Obama to spend a record $10 billion more on child nutrition programs over 10 years, including school food.
 Although school food directors and the growing ranks of those seeking to improve what is served in the lunchroom are disappointed with the numbers coming out of Washington, people who have been working with the Agriculture Department and Congress to improve school food say the bill's $4.5-billion increase is an historic improvement.
 ''We'd all like to do more and we're going to try, but we've got to get started,'' said Senator Blanche Lincoln, Democrat of Arkansas, the chairwoman of the Senate committee on agriculture and the architect of the bill. The legislation proposes the first real increase over inflation that the school food program has had in several decades. And, she said, in the current economic climate, any money is a victory. 
 The Child Nutrition Act comes up for financing every five years. It pays for school food and other nutrition programs for lower-income children. It's also the mechanism legislators can use to change the rules that govern those programs. The bill headed to the Senate floor would increase by about 6 cents the $2.68 that schools can get for each lunch -- far less than the $1-a-lunch increase that a coalition of groups seeking to change school food programs have been campaigning for.
 Margo Wootan, director of nutrition policy for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, an advocacy group, said the bill was still worth supporting.
 ''This is the strongest child nutrition reauthorization bill I have ever seen,'' said Ms. Wootan, who has worked to improve school nutrition standards for 17 years. ''We can't go from candy bars to apples in one fell swoop.''
 In addition to the increase in financing, Agriculture Department staff members said a number of less obvious changes in nutritional rules and financing for special programs will improve what is served in schools as soon as next year. 
 For example, milk is the biggest single source of saturated fat on the lunch line. The bill would allow only skim milk to be offered, banning whole and 2 percent milk. And schools will be required to ensure that children have water with their meals. 
 At least $40 million would be spent on farm-to-school programs and school gardens. Another $10 million would go toward adding organic food. And millions more have been included to train cafeteria workers.
 One of the biggest changes involves food sold in places other than the cafeteria, like vending machines, sporting events and hallway fund-raisers. The law would give the Agriculture Department power to set limits on nutrients like sodium and fat in all food sold on campus, and it would set limits on the number of bake sales and other food-based fund-raisers. 
 ''We want to make sure there's consistency,'' Senator Lincoln said. ''This is not only about providing nutritional food for our children but teaching them good life skills and what the right choices are.'' 
 The Agriculture Department is also overhauling all school nutritional guidelines in an effort that is separate from the Child Nutrition Act, but which is intended to work in concert with the changes it will bring about.
 The meal standards, which haven't been changed for 15 years, are now being updated by the Agriculture Department. Based on a report from the Institutes of Medicine, the new standards will require more fruits, vegetables and whole grains and, for the first time, limit the amount of calories in each meal.
 ''Look at the regulations now,'' said Renee Hanks, food service director for the South Colonie School District in Albany. ''The U.S.D.A. requires so many carbohydrates that we're throwing whole-wheat bread at them. We're throwing extra crackers at them. If they aren't out and active, they can't handle all those calories.''
 But, she warned, adding new requirements for more expensive foods like fresh fruit must come with more money. 
 Changes to the bureaucratic process might free up some money in school budgets, analysts said. For example, the amount of paperwork needed to assure that some lower-income children qualify for a free lunch will be reduced, and the cost of a meal for children who pay full price will likely increase. Extra training money should also help school kitchens operate more efficiently.
 Whether more money will be added before the final bill is approved later this year is in question. Even if more money for the bill does appear, it will likely go toward the parts of the act that pay for hunger programs, not school lunch, Agriculture Department officials and overhaul advocates agree.
 That doesn't mean the conversation is necessarily over, said Rochelle Davis, the founding executive director of the Healthy Schools Campaign, a national nonprofit organization. The new nutritional requirements mean nothing if school districts cannot pay for them. Accepting the small increase in school food financing and calling it a victory lets Congress off the hook, she said.
 ''Look at the agony our country is going through over health care and the struggle to handle a sick nation,'' she said. ''We just have to connect the dots and get people eating right and get people moving. Healthy school food is a logical part of that.''

HEADLINE: On China's Hainan Island, The Boom Is Deafening

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG; Xiyun Yang contributed reporting.

 BODY:
SANYA, China -- One developer is building what he calls Asia's largest hotel, with space for a casino and a greyhound racetrack. 
 The Visun Royal Yacht Club, China's largest, plans to buy a helicopter for the use of its members. A golf course that charges $180 per round is opening 220 villas, each with its own butler, swimming pool and spa -- ''I want to get it into the Guinness Book of World Records for the most spas anywhere,'' the manager says.
 Then there are the property speculators flying to this resort town from across China with bagfuls of cash, to buy apartments whose cost per square foot rivals parts of Manhattan. Five-star hotels during the recent Lunar New Year holiday charged $1,500 or more per night; one company charged $80 just to camp out in a tent.
 In the last two months, Hainan, an island the size of Belgium in the South China Sea, has become a potent symbol of China's economic vitality -- or, perhaps, its excesses. Even in a country where new wealth spawns new tales of luxury living every day, Hainan is viewed with a mix of awe, envy and disgust. 
 The boom here, unfolding as much of the world grapples with a recession, is fueled by a first-of-its-kind edict from the nation's top leaders: On Dec. 31, the State Council, the Chinese cabinet, issued a memorandum that said Hainan had been designated a ''test case'' in developing an ''internationally competitive tourist destination.'' 
 Investors are interpreting that as a no-holds-barred effort to remake Hainan into the Chinese equivalent of Monaco, Las Vegas and Hawaii. While there is no clear indication that the authorities will permit the introduction of licensed casino gambling, some are betting that Hainan could overtake Macao, the former Portguese colony that is now under Chinese sovereignty, as China's preferred island of iniquity. 
 ''It's as if they've injected a growth hormone into the economic development here, and people are wondering how it will all turn out,'' said Xie Xiangxiang, the head of the Sanya Tourism Association.
 The Hainan gold rush is the buzz across China. One American businessman in Beijing, Christopher Reynolds, said a group of Chinese artists told him to invest in Hainan real estate. Chinese couples on dates in Beijing restaurants chatter about it. In February, the average sales price of property in Sanya and Haikou, Hainan's two main cities, showed a 50 percent increase over the same month last year, five times the national rate, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. 
 ''People are coming with entire bags full of cash,'' said Raymond Hau, general manager of the Sun Valley Golf Resort, which is building the 220 luxury villas. ''I've seen this myself. A man had a bag and unzipped it. Boom. 'Here's the deposit,' he said. 'I want two apartments.'''
 Mr. Hau shook his head. ''It's crazy. It can only happen in China.'' 
 The golf resort is popular with the privileged. The president of Kazakhstan shot a hole in one here. And on a recent afternoon, when an attendant opened the passenger door of a black sport-utility vehicle that had just pulled up, a pile of large-denomination Chinese bills fluttered to the ground. 
 Billboards across Hainan advertise property for sale in developments with names like Miami and East Bahamas. The face of Zhang Ziyi, one of China's most popular actresses, is plastered on some of the advertisements. The most prominent development is a series of four luxury apartment towers and a ''seven star'' hotel on Phoenix Island, a spit of sand off the coast that was created by the provincial government as a cruise ship dock. 
 The apartments -- sweeping sea views, bathtubs on balconies and sofas wrapped in velvet -- are being pre-sold for an average of $885 per square foot, comparable to New York prices, said Wu Lei, a spokeswoman for the real estate company.
 The hype over Hainan has inspired criticism from many quarters. In an interview, Han Han, China's most popular blogger, expressed contempt for the investment pouring into the island. Last month, People's Daily and China Youth Daily, both official newspapers, ran editorials lamenting the rising housing and hotel prices. The editors appeared concerned that the stratospheric prices could highlight, for many Chinese, the growing class divide in this country.
 ''How can we create a stable and harmonious living environment if the island's ordinary residents do not have the ability to buy housing?'' wrote the editors of People's Daily.
 Even officials in Hainan seem worried. In mid-January, the provincial government announced a temporary halt to new commercial development projects. Gambling is another uncertainty. Some officials have said only modest forms of betting will be allowed, while others say Hainan could push the limits. 
 At the moment, gambling is banned across China, except in Macao. The history of Hainan in the 1990s offers a cautionary tale. Early that decade, after the Chinese government had designated Hainan one of the country's ''special economic zones,'' property speculators flocked to the island. Some of China's most successful real estate magnates, including Pan Shiyi of Soho China and Feng Lun of the Vantone Group, made their first fortunes on Hainan. Across China, the island's freewheeling capitalism became synonymous with corruption. The bubble burst after a few years, and the island stagnated. 
 Now, in Sanya, even those benefiting from the current boom say property and hotel prices have reached absurd levels. ''There's no real economy,'' said Lin Mingkun, the manager of the yacht club and a condo owner. ''It's a bubble economy.''
 Some residents say they are being priced out of housing options. On the west side of the yacht marina, there is a neighborhood where more than 1,000 fishermen and family members live in cramped alleyways. 
 The families have lived here for generations, but local officials and the real estate company that owns the yacht club, Hongzhou Group, are trying to persuade them to move off the land. Four women sitting outside one home said the Hongzhou Group was offering less than $20 a square foot as compensation.
 ''If we get kicked out, there won't be a house for the next generation,'' said one, Ms. Shi, 48, who agreed to speak on the condition that only her last name be printed. 
 Mr. Lin said the Hongzhou Group was building an apartment complex across the harbor for the families and would pay them more than $40 per square foot for their property. The fishing boats would be moved into another bay, he said.
 The Hongzhou company, with its gleaming Times Coast condominium development by the marina, is in the vanguard of Hainan's transformation. The yacht club already boasts more than 80 members who have each paid $92,000 for the privilege of parking their boats here for 23 years.
 ''In China, Sanya will be the leader in luxury leisure,'' Wang Dafu, the owner of Hongzhou, said one afternoon while cruising the bay in his 72-foot Pershing yacht.
 He puffed on a Cohiba cigar. ''The reason you earn money,'' he said, ''is to spend it.''

HEADLINE: A Bridge To Fame In Boise. Honest.

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

 BODY:
BOISE, Idaho -- For 14 years Doug Stirling has worked the register at the Airport Chevron and watched as this city and its ambitions grew around him. 
 In came the transplants from California and elsewhere. Out crept development from downtown. Up ticked the traffic and the congestion at the crossroads he calls home, Exit 53 on Interstate 84, one of the busiest intersections in all of Idaho. 
 ''I don't know if it's nicer,'' Mr. Stirling said of his city, ''but it's more metropolitan.''
 Now, Exit 53 is no longer just an off ramp. It is the Vista Avenue Interchange, and its ascendance will soon be complete thanks to $17.8 million in stimulus money. While plenty of other stimulus projects in Idaho cost more, it is hard to imagine one being cast as more transformative than the replacement of this humble highway overpass. To hear some state officials, the future of the region is at stake.
 ''Vista is the gateway to the airport, downtown, the Capitol and Boise State University,'' Gov. C.L. Otter said the day of the groundbreaking last August. ''A modern, safe interchange will position the entire Treasure Valley for further economic growth and prosperity.''
 The project is celebrated in an exhibition and video kiosk at the airport, near the baggage claim area. The Idaho Transportation Department is producing its third online video on the changes under way, and the department corresponds on its Facebook page with motorists both excited and wary of the project. A page about the interchange is being added to the state driver's education manual. 
 Education is at the core of the promotion, said June Sparks, a transportation department spokeswoman and a star of the videos. 
 Vista will feature Idaho's first ''single point urban interchange,'' which is a centralized signal system that coordinates all traffic entering, exiting or crossing the highway. Other states have similar intersections, but Ms. Sparks said Idaho wanted to make sure its motorists knew ''how to drive through it.''
 Ms. Sparks posted photographs on Facebook this month showing progress on the project. ''The butterfly,'' she wrote, ''is getting ready to emerge from its giant construction chrysalis.''

HEADLINE: Tech Sector Rally Helps Wall Street Stay Positive

BYLINE: By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
Wall Street ended slightly higher on Tuesday as an energized technology sector helped offset worries about foreign debt.
 Investors snapped up shares of Apple after news reports said that the company was designing an iPhone for Verizon Wireless's network. That led to a broader rally for technology stocks, but the gains were limited amid concern that a deficit crisis in Europe could hamper growth.
 Apple rose 1.5 percent to $235.83 a share after reaching a 52-week high during the day. Verizon gained 2.6 percent to $31.23, and AT&T -- currently the only network that supports the iPhone -- dropped 2.1 percent to $25.95. 
 Fears of unsustainable deficits abroad continued to shake global markets on Tuesday. Standard & Poor's said it had downgraded its rating of Iceland's local currency, and interest rates on Greek bonds rose, signaling dwindling investor confidence. In response, major European indexes fell.
 ''The debt worries set a precedent for a host of other countries -- Japan, the U.K., and the United States,'' said Michael Shinnick, a portfolio manager for Wasatch Funds. ''If you can't get spending in order and you can't raise revenue, then financing costs can really jump.''
 Investors found some hope in the latest batch of data on the housing market and consumer confidence. But the numbers also brought steep hurdles into focus. 
 The Case-Shiller Index showed home prices in 20 metropolitan markets unexpectedly rose 0.3 percent in January, beating estimates of a 0.3 percent drop. In addition, the Conference Board reported that Americans were slightly more optimistic about the economy in March than February. But the details of the reports were not as rosy. There were signs that last fall's rebound in housing prices was slowing. 
 In addition, while consumer confidence rose 6.1 points in March, to 52.5, the monthly gain did not mask concern among Americans about prospects for business activity and employment. The two reports helped quell worries about another downturn but underscored a sense that relief would be elusive.
 ''The recovery has enough legs that the risk of a double-dip recession is becoming smaller and smaller,'' said Hank B. Smith, chief investment officer for Haverford Investments. ''But there is still anxiety.''
 Indexes meandered much of the day, held back by a dip in financial shares. Bank of America fell 1.6 percent and Citigroup dropped more than 2 percent.
 At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 11.56 points, or 0.11 percent, to 10,907.42, just 93 points shy of the 11,000-point threshold. Shares of 3M, the manufacturing and technology giant, surged 3.6 percent to $84.28 after analysts said earnings might be stronger than expected.
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index ended virtually flat, registering a gain of 0.05 point to finish at 1,173.27 points. The Nasdaq rose 6.33 points, or 0.26 percent, to 2,410.69.
 The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 3/32, to 98 3/32, and the yield was unchanged at 3.86 percent.
 Investors will get a critical snapshot of the economy on Friday, when the monthly employment report is released. Analysts believe that the labor market reached a turning point in March, with the economy adding jobs. 
 Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News believe 184,000 jobs were created, largely because of a lift from census hiring. The report may also be higher because of severe snowstorms in February, which economists believe may have exaggerated the magnitude of February's job losses, which totaled 36,000. The unemployment rate is expected to remain steady at 9.7 percent.

HEADLINE: Incentives Helped Sales Rebound, Toyota Says

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD and HIROKO TABUCHI

 BODY:
Toyota, which introduced generous incentives in a bid to attract customers after a string of recalls, said on Tuesday that its sales in the United States probably rose by a third in March.
 The disclosure by James Lentz, the president of its American sales operations, came as the federal government said it was calling in experts from NASA and the National Academy of Sciences in an effort to discover what led to the sudden acceleration problems that forced recalls of more than eight million vehicles worldwide since September. 
 Meanwhile, in Japan, the automaker held the first high-level meeting of executives charged with overseeing safety and promised to listen more carefully to customer complaints. 
 Toyota recalled the vehicles to repair gas pedals that could jam or get caught in floor mats and to fix software flaws in its high-technology braking systems. The company has repaired 1.2 million of 1.9 million vehicles recalled in the United States for potentially sticky pedals, Mr. Lentz said.
 Reports of runaway Toyotas and criticism of the company's slow handling of defects hurt sales, generated lawsuits and prompted Congressional hearings into the response by Toyota and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
 In the United States, sales fell 9 percent in February from 2009, while sales in the European Union fell 20 percent in February from a year earlier. Toyota said last week that it would temporarily halt production in France and Britain to reduce inventory. 
 This last month, Toyota introduced lease deals and interest-free loans on its vehicles in the United States, apparently to a strong response. Mr. Lentz, speaking after an industry forum on the eve of the New York International Auto Show, said that sales rose 30 to 35 percent this month, compared with 2009. Carmakers report March sales figures on Thursday.
 One beneficiary is the RAV4, a small sport utility vehicle. Toyota sold 22,000 in March, Mr. Lentz said, compared with 6,500 in February, when Toyota's incentives had not yet had a significant impact. ''Maybe we overdid the incentives,'' he joked.
 Asked how long it would take before Toyota could repair damage to its brand, Mr. Lentz replied, ''I don't think it's decades. I think it's a matter of time.'' 
 He said the company's biggest goal is to again convert owners of non-Toyota vehicles to the automaker, an important reason behind its growth to become the second-largest seller in the United States and the world's largest. 
 ''The challenge will be to attract conquest buyers down the road,'' he said. ''It's not weeks, it's not months, hopefully, it's not years.''
 Mr. Lentz said the company welcomed efforts by scientists from NASA and specialists from the science academy to study whether electronic problems had been involved in Toyota's instances of sudden acceleration. The effort was announced by Ray LaHood, the transportation secretary. 
 ''The more discussion of science and facts, the better,'' Mr. Lentz said. 
 Along with clearing its reputation, Toyota is trying to lift its bottom line after losses during the global economic crisis. The company recorded its first loss in decades in the year ended March 31, 2009, but it returned to profit in the most recent two quarters. 
 ''Listening to consumer voices is most important in regaining credibility from our customers,'' the Toyota president, Akio Toyoda, said at a news conference in Toyota City, Japan, after the quality committee meeting. ''We are setting up a system to respond more quickly to complaints.'' 
 The meeting Tuesday brought together 70 executives and officials from Toyota's global operations. The effort to lift quality at the company will be led by a team of chief quality officers from major regions, including North America and Europe. Toyota said it would hold global quality meetings twice a year and regional meetings more frequently. 
 ''I represent the voice of customers in North America,'' said Steve St. Angelo, the North American chief quality officer, who also is in charge of its manufacturing operations in Georgetown, Ky. ''It is my job to make sure that they are understood.'' 
 ''We have full involvement of any safety issues going forward,'' he said, though he added that any decision to issue a recall in the region would be based on ''consensus decision-making'' with Toyota executives in Japan. Mr. Toyoda has said decision-making would continue to rest in Japan.
 The carmaker has promised to include outside experts in evaluating quality measures. The quality committee will issue its first report in June.
 Toyota also showed reporters a string of testing facilities at its headquarters in Toyota City: a machine that spots cracks in tiny auto parts, a ''high-function shower'' that sprays cars with water to check for leaks and a chamber that tests cars in extreme temperatures. 
 Toyota said it would set up four additional training centers in China, Europe, North America and Southeast Asia, modeled after a center it already runs in Japan. 
 But Shinichi Sasaki, executive vice president in charge of quality assurance, said that the facilities ''can't test customer satisfaction. For that, we'll have to talk to our customers directly.''

HEADLINE: Riojas That Satisfy in Taste and Value

BYLINE: By ERIC ASIMOV

 BODY:
WE on the wine panel are subject to the same economic pressures that buffet the rest of the country, so we, too, want to spend less on wine. Of course, we were always concerned with value. Now we are extra concerned with finding not just good, inexpensive wines but also the best values in every category.
 The last panel focused on Loire Valley reds, one of the world's great wine values. They have a distinctiveness that is difficult to find elsewhere in the same price range. But Spain, which has any number of wines that can be considered fine values, comes pretty close with Rioja crianzas.
 What is this word ''crianza''? First of all, it is pronounced cree-AHN-tha, though you may be excused if you choose not to employ the voiceless dental fricative, the linguistic term for the Castilian lisp of the final syllable. A simple -zah will do. 
 Riojas have historically been classified by how long they are aged before the bottles are released. Light and fruity joven wines, which are released virtually as soon as the transformation to wine is complete, are rarely seen in the United States. Next comes crianza, the youngest of the aged Riojas. By law, crianzas must spend at least one year in oak barrels and cannot be sold until two years after the harvest, though in fact some wineries hold on to their bottles longer. The next-oldest Riojas are those labeled reserva, which must be aged at least three years before release. Last are the gran reservas, with at least five years. 
 But let's not get bogged down in technicalities. What's important is to understand that no other category of Spanish red wine is as consistently satisfying and as good a value as Rioja crianza.
 This was amply confirmed at a wine-panel tasting of 20 crianzas. Florence Fabricant and I were joined by Kerin Auth, an owner of Tinto Fino, an East Village shop specializing in Spanish wines, and my friend Rafael Mateo, proprietor of Pata Negra, a ham-and-tapas bar also in the East Village.
 All of us were impressed by the high quality of these wines. Florence likened the crianzas to ordinary Chianti Classicos, which might be overshadowed by longer-aged, showier riservas and super-Tuscans but are just right for ordinary meals. Similarly, the spotlight often falls on the more expensive Riojas, but while they are stored away to wait for properly august occasions, the crianzas are delicious everyday wines.
 The 20 bottles seemed to divide into two major styles. Some were lighter, silkier and more elegant while others were denser, darker, heavier and more powerful. We all have our personal preferences, but we agreed that wines in both styles were well made.
 Personally, I prefer the lighter wines. With their almost tender texture, they are unlike wines made anywhere else in the world. This leanness finds its greatest expression in the gran reserva Riojas, which after years of aging are gorgeously delicate and complex, emphasizing flavors of smoke and leather over fruit. The bolder, plusher wines are nothing to dismiss, but I don't find them as distinctive or interesting.
 Both Kerin and Rafael in particular were surprised by how much they liked the denser wines. They thought that even these more powerful wines would be good partners with food. 
 Case in point: our No. 7 wine, the 2006 Monte Real from Bodegas Riojanas. I know this producer for its old-style gran reservas, which show the mellowing effects of long-term aging in oak. But this wine was dark, ripe, round and powerful, yet balanced and true to its Rioja identity.
 Part of that identity is the harmonious evidence of oak, used to accent the berry flavors of the tempranillo grape, which most often forms the backbone of these wines. For many years Rioja was typically aged in large vats made of American oak. Sometimes, the vats were used for many years, softening their influence to a subtle vanilla that cushioned the spicy fruit flavors of the grape.
 Today, just as many wineries are using small barrels of new French oak, which gives a darker, toastier, more overt flavor to the wine. Some wineries even use a combination of French and American oak. Bodegas Fin de Siglo, for example, which produced our No. 2 wine, the 2004 Ribaguda, uses French and American oak. The result was a lovely, balanced wine that showed complexity in its smoky, earthy, fruity flavors. 
 No French oak in our No. 1 wine, the 2003 Vina Cubillo from R. Lopez de Heredia, the oldest of the old-school Rioja makers. This wine is aged in old barrels of American oak, and it epitomizes elegance and harmony with its light, graceful, silky texture. My only complaint about this wine was that it lacked a little energy and vivacity, most likely because of the extreme heat that blanketed Europe in summer 2003.
 At $26, the Vina Cubillo was the most expensive in the tasting. Only one other bottle was more than $20, and of our top 10 wines, 7 were $14 or under. Our best value in a tasting full of good values was the 2005 Sierra Cantabria, spicy and energetic, with lingering flavors of fruit, flowers and minerals. At $14, it's hard to go wrong with a bottle like this.
 What didn't we like? Well, even in a category where oak flavors are expected, too much oak results in an out-of-balance wine. We found a few of those. Too much fruit can equally upset the balance, resulting in overwrought, overbearing wines. We found a few of those, too.
 But those were the exceptions. More often we found gentle, pure wines that nonetheless had structure and character, like the 2004 Rondan from Saenz de Santamaria, at $14; the elegant 2005 Vina Izadi, $13; and the soft, clean and balanced 2005 El Coto, $12.
 In the riper style were the robust, fruity 2004 Marques de Vitoria, at $19, and the dense, muscular 2005 Marques de Caceres, a mere $9. Great values, all.

 Recipe: Pairings: Barbecue Beef Tongue
 Rioja crianzas can handle rustic food. I thought of these wines recently when I was in Miami, having brunch at Michael's Genuine Food and Drink. The day was chilly, and one of the dishes we ordered, with beer, is called barbecue beef tongue, a bold, richly succulent dish that suited the unseasonal weather. Too bad there was no Rioja crianza on the wine list. 
 The recipe is somewhat surprising. I expected the tongue to be slow-cooked over applewood or hickory, but the barbecue is contributed by a mere couple of tablespoons of sauce added to the braising liquid. Once the tongue is done -- and it calls for quite an investment in unattended time -- it is delicious. 
 Barbecue Beef Tongue
 Adapted from Michael's Genuine Food and Drink, Miami
 Time: 5 hours, plus 2 or more hours' chilling
 1beef tongue, 2 to 3 pounds, rinsed
 1/2carrot, diced
 1celery stalk, diced
 1medium onion, diced
 2thyme sprigs
 1 cup flat-leaf parsley
 1teaspoon black peppercorns
 2tablespoons Chinese or Thai barbecue sauce
 1quart veal or beef stock
 2quarts chicken stock
 2 1/2cups arugula or baby spinach
 1tablespoon red wine vinegar
 1tablespoon extra virgin olive oil.
 1. Heat oven to 325 degrees. In a deep ovenproof casserole, 5 to 6 quarts, place the tongue, carrot, celery, onion, thyme, parsley, peppercorns, barbecue sauce, veal stock and just enough chicken stock to cover tongue. Bring to a boil, stir, cover and place in the oven. Check liquid from time to time, adding more chicken stock as needed. When tongue is very tender, about 3 hours, remove it from pot to cool. Let uncovered pot cool about an hour.
 2. Strain cooking liquid into a 4-quart saucepan, bring to a boil and reduce to 3 cups, about 45 minutes. Meanwhile, peel skin from tongue, wrap tongue in plastic and refrigerate at least 2 hours or overnight. (Reduced cooking liquid can also be refrigerated.) 
 3. Slice tongue 1/2-inch thick. Arrange slices, slightly overlapping, in a large skillet. Pour reduced sauce over, bring to a simmer and cook about 30 minutes, until syrupy. Toss greens with vinegar and oil. Transfer tongue to a serving platter, spoon sauce over tongue and serve with greens alongside.
 Yield: 4 to 6 servings, 8 to 12 as a first course

HEADLINE: Courts Can Oversee Pay At Funds, Justices Say

BYLINE: By ADAM LIPTAK

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Courton Tuesday ruled that courts have a role, though a limited one, in policing the compensation of mutual fund investment advisers. 
 The ruling set aside a decision from the federal appeals court in Chicago that said the marketplace could for the most part be trusted to set such pay. But the standard adopted in Tuesday's decision was distinctly fuzzy and might provide little concrete guidance to the lower courts.
 The case was brought by investors in Oakmark mutual funds who said the funds had overpaid their investment adviser, Harris Associates. Like most mutual funds, Oakmark was formed by its investment adviser, which selected the fund's board. That board then negotiated the adviser's fees. 
 Apparently wary of the potential conflicts of interest such arrangements can entail, Congress in 1970 imposed fiduciary duty on advisers concerning their compensation.
 The Oakmark investors said Harris Associates had violated its fiduciary duty by charging them twice as much as the company charged independent institutional investors like pension funds. 
 A three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, in Chicago, said such a disparity was irrelevant. ''A fiduciary must make full disclosure and play no tricks but is not subject to a cap on compensation,'' the chief judge, Frank H. Easterbrook, wrote for the panel.
 Mutual fund investors unhappy with the fees they are charged may withdraw their money and invest it elsewhere, Judge Easterbrook said.
 Dissenting from the full appeals court's decision not to rehear the case, Judge Richard A. Posnersaid the panel decision relied ''mainly on an economic analysis that is ripe for re-examination.'' Executive and other pay was out of control, he said, and the marketplace could not be trusted to rein it in.
 In the decision on Tuesday, Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., writing for a unanimous court, declined to take sides in the dispute between the two judges, both known for their engagement with economic theory. 
 Justice Alito instead adopted the standard set out in the leading appeals court case on the issue, Gartenberg v. Merrill Lynch Asset Management, which was decided in 1982 by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in New York.
 The upshot was not a victory for legal clarity, Justice Alito conceded.
 The 1970 law, he wrote, was ''hardly pellucid,'' and the Gartenberg standard, which takes account of many factors, ''may lack sharp analytical clarity.'' 
 Under Gartenberg, a mutual fund adviser violates the 1970 law only if it charges a fee ''that is so disproportionately large that it bears no reasonable relationship to the services rendered and could not have been the product of arm's-length bargaining.''
 Justice Alito did give lower courts some guidance about the relevance of two kinds of comparisons.
 First, he said, courts may consider differences in fees charged to different kinds of clients. But he noted that there might be good reasons for the differences, including ''the greater frequency of shareholder redemptions in a mutual fund, the higher turnover of mutual fund assets, the more burdensome regulatory and legal obligations, and higher marketing costs.'' He added that parity was not necessarily required.
 Second, Justice Alito said, courts ''should not rely too heavily'' on comparisons to what other mutual funds pay their advisers. Such comparisons, he said, ''are problematic because these fees, like those challenged, may not be the product of negotiations conducted at arm's length.''
 In a concurrence, Justice Clarence Thomas cautioned against reading too much into the court's opinion, which he said ''does not countenance the free-ranging judicial 'fairness' review of fees that Gartenberg could be read to authorize.''
 The case itself, Jones v. Harris Associates, No. 08-586, was returned to the lower courts for application of the new standard. 
 Justice Alito also suggested that another body might want to adjudicate the dispute between Judge Easterbrook and Judge Posner about whether the recent economic crisis suggested that more regulation was warranted. ''The debate,'' Justice Alito wrote, ''is a matter for Congress, not the courts.''

HEADLINE: The Bill Is Passed, but Debate Goes On

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Fix Health Reform, Then Repeal It,'' by Paul Ryan, a Republican member of Congress (Op-Ed, March 26):
 Mr. Ryan writes that ''it is not sufficient for those of us in the opposition to await a reversal of political fortune months or years from now before we advance action on health care reform.''
 I can't help but ask: if Republicans had a health care reform agenda, why didn't they enact it when they were in control? 
 Instead, Mr. Ryan complains that Democrats rejected his plan. Democrats were right. As the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities concluded, Mr. Ryan's plan ''would likely make comprehensive, affordable coverage less available to many who now have it while failing to significantly reduce the number of uninsured Americans.''
 Mr. Ryan's plan lost because of a lack of merit. Now Republicans want to repeal the better plan. Paul Krugman (''Going to Extreme,'' column, March 26) is right: ''It's a party that fundamentally doesn't accept anyone else's right to govern.''
 Joel Peskoff Baldwin, N.Y., March 26, 2010
 To the Editor:
 Representative Paul Ryan states that the Democratic majority got it ''backward'' in promoting universal health care coverage before bringing down health care costs.
 While this argument has some superficial appeal, it is Mr. Ryan who has it backward. Having everyone in the system creates the political will to make the hard decisions necessary to hold down costs. It may be no coincidence that our peer countries, all of which have universal coverage, have done a far better job spending less to get comparable results to our considerably more expensive system.
 Managing costs does not create an incentive to provide universal coverage. But universal coverage provides a powerful incentive to manage costs.
 Daniel A. Simon New York, March 27, 2010
 To the Editor:
 Representative Paul Ryan was right on the money. The truth is that Republicans want health care reform, too. The difference is how they want to pay for it. The first step (as Mr. Ryan says) is to tie the tax relief for health care premiums to the individual, not the workplace. The second step, in my opinion, would be to pay for most of the cost with a consumption tax (perhaps a national sales tax) so that everyone participates.
 Funding an entitlement program with an open-ended and unpredictable cost (the Congressional Budget Office has always underestimated the true cost) should not be tied to a tax on a small portion of the economy. Look at what has happened to Social Security and Medicare.
 The new law should definitely be repealed.
 Jack I. Selber Houston, March 26, 2010
 To the Editor:
 No one will ever say it better than Michael Douglas's character did in the film ''The American President.'' Speaking of his Republican challenger, he said at a press conference: ''Whatever your particular problem is, friend, I promise you, Bob Rumson is not the least bit interested in solving it. He is interested in two things and two things only: making you afraid of it and telling you who's to blame for it.''
 Even while I strongly doubt Paul Ryan's argument that tax reform will magically transform a broken health care system, it's still nice to see a Republican actually discussing substance even as the majority of his colleagues are fear-mongering and rabble-rousing.
 Aaron R. Cahn New York, March 26, 2010
 To the Editor:
 Representative Paul Ryan presents many viable ideas that could have been publicly discussed during the health care debate, like tax credits for the individual, not the employer. But Republicans were more concerned about sound bites of ''Armageddon'' and ''socialized medicine'' that made headlines rather than substantive dialogue.
 As a result, more moderate views were and continue to be drowned out by all the shouting. Maybe next time Republicans can play constructive partners rather than pure obstructionists and actually be a part of major legislation.

 To the Editor:
 Re ''The Legal Assault on Health Reforms'' (editorial, March 29):
 Legal opposition to the private insurance mandate is not limited to ''disgruntled conservatives.'' I think many people would agree that Congress should not be able to force any individual to participate in any private market. Especially considering that the health care bill does not provide Americans with a publicly managed insurance option, Congress has gone beyond interstate regulation and into private conscription.
 We all should be concerned about the government drafting Americans to go shopping. If the Supreme Court eventually rules that the mandate is illegal, I hope that Congress will realize that a single-payer, Medicare-for-all solution is not only a more effective option for insuring everyone, but also one that is actually constitutional.
 Nikolas Bowie Cambridge, Mass., March 29, 2010
 To the Editor:
 Re ''Lawmakers Head Warily for Home'' (editorial, March 27):
 I opened my mailbox a couple of days ago, and found a check from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. One of the banks where I had an account had been shut down a few days earlier, and the letter accompanying the check was my first intimation of this bank failure. I can only marvel at how well this insurance program works -- no panic, no anxiety, just a check in the mail. Is there anyone out there who would deposit money in an uninsured bank today?
 Insurance of any kind is the purest form of socialism. Society pools its resources together to protect against any individual's sudden loss or misfortune. Bank insurance, auto insurance, home insurance -- all pure socialism, some mandated and some not, but it would be harder to survive without them.
 In the case of health insurance, the relatively healthy people (who make up most of the population) help pay the high medical costs of treating the sick people. Improving the basic structure of this market is not any more socialism than we already have, and it certainly does not fit the House minority leader's cries of ''Armageddon.''
 Kumar Venkat Portland, Ore., March 27, 2010
 To the Editor:
 Now that the health care reform bill has passed, we have the answer to Sarah Palin's question ''How's that hopey-changey thing working out?''
 Actually, quite well, thank you.
 Richard E. Hockman Redding, Conn., March 26, 2010

HEADLINE: Obama Expects U.N. Sanctions On Iran to Be Approved Soon

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER; Ian Austen contributed reporting from Gatineau, Quebec.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama predicted on Tuesday that he would be able to persuade the United Nations to ''move forcefully'' against Iran with new sanctions within weeks, not months, as he turned up the pressure on Tehran to back off its nuclear program. 
 ''We think that we can get sanctions within weeks,'' Mr. Obama told reporters after meeting at the White House with President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, who has been pressing for an aggressive approach to Iran.
 But Mr. Obama acknowledged that there was still no consensus among the members of the Security Council. ''Now, do we have unanimity in the international community?'' he asked rhetorically. ''Not yet. And that's something we have to work on.''
 Mr. Obama's remarks came hours after Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met in Canada with foreign ministers from the Group of 8, who issued a statement casting doubt on Iran's claims that it is seeking a peaceful energy source rather than nuclear arms. ''We see a growing awareness on the part of many countries, including China, as to the consequences of a nuclear-armed Iran to regional and global stability,'' Mrs. Clinton said.
 The American assertiveness may reflect growing confidence that the administration can persuade China to let a tough sanctions resolution through the Security Council, where it has a veto. China so far has resisted the harshest measures proposed by the Americans and Europeans, but in recent days has begun engaging in more talks.
 Mr. Sarkozy, in his first visit to the White House since Mr. Obama took office, made clear his desire for ''strong, tough sanctions,'' gently prodding Mr. Obama to move decisively. ''The time has come to take decisions,'' he said. ''Iran cannot continue its mad race.''
 Facing political problems at home after his party's defeat in regional elections this month, Mr. Sarkozy arrived in the United States with a sharp message urging more leadership in creating global financial regulations to prevent another economic crisis. In a speech on Monday at Columbia University, he said that America ''should reflect on what it means to be the world's No. 1 power'' and that the world needed ''an America that listens.''
 Mr. Sarkozy softened his tone at the White House, where he and his wife, Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, were to join the president and the first lady, Michelle Obama, for a private dinner. Mr. Sarkozy again pushed for a ''new world international monetary order'' but praised Mr. Obama, saying ''there's a lot of trust'' despite their differences. ''There may be disagreements but never for the wrong reasons,'' he said.
 Mr. Obama passed off Mr. Sarkozy's comments at Columbia with a joke. ''I listen to Nicolas all the time,'' he said. ''I can't stop listening to him.''

HEADLINE: Obama Signs Overhaul of Student Loan Program

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER and DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

 BODY:
ALEXANDRIA, Va. -- President Obama signed legislation on Tuesday to expand college access for millions of young Americans by revamping the federal student loan program in what he called ''one of the most significant investments in higher education since the G.I. Bill.''
 Mr. Obama went to a community college where the wife of his vice president teaches to draw attention to the student loan overhaul attached to the final piece of health care legislation that passed last week. In signing the bill, Mr. Obama put the final touches on his health care program but used the occasion to highlight the education provisions. 
 ''That's two major victories in one week,'' he told students and guests at the Alexandria campus of Northern Virginia Community College, where Jill Biden teaches English. While he praised the health care overhaul, the president said, ''what's gotten overlooked amid all the hoopla, all the drama of last week, is what's happened with education.''
 The new law will eliminate fees paid to private banks to act as intermediaries in providing loans to college students and use much of the nearly $68 billion in savings over 11 years to expand Pell grants and make it easier for students to repay outstanding loans after graduating. The law also invests $2 billion in community colleges over the next four years to provide education and career training programs to workers eligible for trade adjustment aid after dislocation in their industries.
 The law will increase Pell grants along with inflation in the next few years, which should raise the maximum grant to $5,975 from $5,550 by 2017, according to the White House, and it will also provide 820,000 more grants by 2020. 
 Students who borrow money starting in July 2014 will be allowed to cap repayments at 10 percent of income above a basic living allowance, instead of 15 percent. Moreover, if they keep up payments, their balances will be forgiven after 20 years instead of 25 years -- or after 10 years if they are in public service, like teaching, nursing or serving in the military.
 Mr. Obama portrayed the overhaul of the student loan program as a triumph over an ''army of lobbyists,'' singling out Sallie Mae, the nation's largest student lender, which he said spent $3 million on lobbying to stop the changes. ''For almost two decades, we've been trying to fix a sweetheart deal in federal law that essentially gave billions of dollars to banks,'' he said. The money, he said, ''was spent padding student lenders' pockets.''
 But Sallie Mae said the law would cost jobs, telling news outlets that it may have to eliminate a third of its 8,500 positions nationwide. Senator Lamar Alexander, a Republican whose state of Tennessee is home to big players in the private student lending industry, said the changes over all would cost 31,000 private-sector jobs.
 In a statement, Mr. Alexander said students would be overcharged on their loans with the proceeds to be used to pay for the health care law, and he bemoaned the government's getting more deeply into the lending business. ''The Obama administration's motto,'' he said, ''is turning out to be: 'If we can find it in the Yellow Pages, the government ought to try to do it.' ''
 The House Republican leader, Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, criticized both the health and education components of the bill, calling them ''two job-killing government takeovers that are already hurting our economy.''
 Mr. Boehner added, ''As the White House continues to 'sell' this new law, we are seeing the same pattern we've seen for the past year: the more the American people learn about it, the less they like it.''

HEADLINE: Chrysler Says It Expects To Break Even This Year

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD

 BODY:
Chrysler, which began its path into bankruptcy a year ago, expects to break even this year, its chief executive, Sergio Marchionne, said on Tuesday.
 Mr. Marchionne, speaking at an automotive forum on the eve of the New York International Auto Show, said the automaker had slightly more than $5 billion in cash on hand.
 That is about half the amount Chrysler had in 2007, after Cerberus Capital Management acquired it from Daimler of Germany. A subsequent slump in car sales led to a financial crisis that prompted Chrysler, and General Motors, to seek federal bailouts. 
 One year ago Tuesday, Chrysler's plan to restructure independently was rejected by the Obama administration, beginning the company's journey into Chapter 11.
 Chrysler entered bankruptcy on May 1, and emerged about six weeks later, with federal assistance. Fiat, which Mr. Marchionne also runs, took management control of the company, which received about $15 billion, in all, from the Bush and Obama administrations.
 In a speech briefly interrupted by protesting members of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, as well as the announcement of a hotel fire alarm test, Mr. Marchionne said Chrysler expected to break even this year, although he declined to predict whether it could earn a profit. 
 One step taken by the company was to weed out a number of consultants, a factor in the company's improved financial health. ''We had more consultants in our place than God knows,'' Mr. Marchionne said. He spoke to a conference sponsored by the National Association of Auto Dealers and HIS Global Insight, an economic forecasting firm.
 Mr. Marchionne said Chrysler planned to present Fiat with a five-year plan in April that would outline the steps it would take back to sustained growth. 
 He said he was encouraged by March auto sales, which Chrysler forecasts will achieve an annual selling rate of 11.5 million vehicles. Traffic has been increased by incentive campaigns led by Toyota, which is trying to attract customers after two major recalls involving six million vehicles in the United States.
 Mr. Marchionne said he also expected annual sales for 2010 of more than 11 million vehicles. A number of industry executives and analysts expect sales around 11.5 million, compared with sales of 10.4 million in 2009. Last year's levels were the lowest in the United States in a quarter century.
 ''The numbers will prove it,'' Mr. Marchionne said. Referring to car buyers, he said, ''I don't think people are as negative as everyone thinks.'' 
 Chrysler, however, has been hit by criticism from some of its former dealers, who were angered by its decision to close nearly 800 dealerships as part of its bankruptcy filing.
 Under federal law, companies that seek bankruptcy are allowed to terminate contracts with vendors, which allowed Chrysler and G.M. to shut hundreds of dealerships.
 But dealers successfully appealed to Congress to establish an arbitration process so they could pursue claims against the car companies.
 Mr. Marchionne said Chrysler agreed to take back 86 dealers, or about a quarter of those who sought to reverse the company's decision in arbitration, and invest $500 million to upgrade dealerships.
 The appeal to Congress ''effectively stopped the reconstitution of the dealer network at G.M. and Chrysler,'' he said, adding that the situation was ''an unpleasant thing.''
 Mr. Marchionne, a lawyer, became a business celebrity in Europe for leading a turnaround at Fiat.
 He told the audience he met another turnaround specialist, Lee A. Iacocca, Chrysler's former chief executive, last summer. But he declined to compare himself with Mr. Iacocca, whom he called ''the best car salesman'' in industry history.
 ''People look for a one-man solution,'' Mr. Marchionne said. ''But I'm an instrument of change.''

HEADLINE: As E-Books Gain Popularity, You Can't Even Judge a Cover

BYLINE: By MOTOKO RICH

 BODY:
Bindu Wiles was on a Q train in Brooklyn this month when she spotted a woman reading a book whose cover had an arresting black silhouette of a girl's head set against a bright orange background.
 Ms. Wiles noticed that the woman looked about her age, 45, and was carrying a yoga mat, so she figured that they were like-minded and leaned in to catch the title: ''Little Bee,'' a novel by Chris Cleave. Ms. Wiles, a graduate student in nonfiction writing at Sarah Lawrence College, tapped a note into her iPhone and bought the book later that week.
 Such encounters are becoming increasingly difficult. With a growing number of people turning to Kindles and other electronic readers, and with the Apple iPad arriving on Saturday, it is not always possible to see what others are reading or to project your own literary tastes. 
 You can't tell a book by its cover if it doesn't have one. 
 ''There's something about having a beautiful book that looks intellectually weighty and yummy,'' said Ms. Wiles, who recalled that when she was rereading ''Anna Karenina'' recently, she liked that people could see the cover on the subway. ''You feel kind of proud to be reading it.'' With a Kindle or Nook, she said, ''people would never know.'' 
 Among other changes heralded by the e-book era, digital editions are bumping book covers off the subway, the coffee table and the beach. That is a loss for publishers and authors, who enjoy some free advertising for their books in printed form: if you notice the jackets on the books people are reading on a plane or in the park, you might decide to check out ''The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo'' or ''The Help,'' too.
 ''So often when you're thinking of a book, you remember its cover,'' said Jeffrey C. Alexander, professor of cultural sociology at Yale. ''It's a way of drawing people through the visual into reading.''
 In the bookstore, where a majority of sales still take place, covers play a crucial role. ''If you have already passed that hurdle of having a customer be attracted to the cover, and then they pick up the book,'' said Patricia Bostelman, vice president for marketing at Barnes & Noble, ''an enormous battle has been won.''
 But it's a victory that will be harder to eke out if no one can tell whether you're reading ''War and Peace'' or ''Diamonds and Desire.''
 Perhaps no other element of the book-making process receives as much input from as many different people as the jacket. First, a creative director comes up with an idea. (How about this image of an apple?) Then the book's editor, author and agent have a look. (Can we enlarge the font size on the author's name? And wasn't an apple used for that book about vampires? This book isn't about vampires.) The publisher of the imprint gets involved. (Vampires sell. I like the apple.) The sales force makes comments. (Isn't there an economics angle? How about an apple with an orange inside? That's worked before.) Even booksellers have an opinion. (What I really love on a cover is a pair of high heels.)
 A good jacket is unlikely to save a bad book, of course. But in a crowded market, a striking cover is one advantage all authors and publishers want. To get a sense of the odds, in a random analysis of 1,000 business books released last year, Codex Group, a publishing consultant, found that only 62 sold more than 5,000 copies.
 Even in the digital era, publishers believe that books need graphic representations -- if only for the online marketing campaign. Regardless of the format, ''they all seem to need what we know of as a cover to identify them,'' said Chip Kidd, associate art director at Alfred A. Knopf. Mr. Kidd has designed more than 1,000 jackets for authors including Cormac McCarthy and James Ellroy.
 The music industry went through a similar transition when digital music devices arrived, but it has pushed back by finding fresh ways to display CD cover art on the Web sites where the songs are bought and the iPod screens where they are played. Publishers have already had some experience tailoring book jackets for the digital world, since so many people now buy even their print copies online. 
 ''We often get requests to make the type bigger,'' said Mario J. Pulice, creative director for the adult trade division of Little, Brown & Company. ''Because when it's on Amazon, you can't read the author's name.'' 
 As publishers explore targeted advertising on Google and other search engines or social networking sites, they figure that a digital cover remains the best way to represent a book.
 Some readers expect makers of electronic devices to add functions that allow users to broadcast what they're reading. ''People like to show off what they're doing and what they like,'' said Maud Newton, a popular book blogger. ''So eventually there will be a way for people to do that with e-readers.''
 For now, many publishers are counting on the Facebook effect. ''Before, you might see three people reading 'Eat, Pray, Love' on the subway,'' said Clare Ferraro, president of Viking and Plume, imprints of Penguin Group USA. ''Now you're going to log onto Facebook and see that three of your friends are reading 'Eat, Pray, Love.' '' 
 Even avid online networkers rely on physical book covers in the real world. Heather E. Johnson, 32, who writes reviews on her blog, ''Age 30+...A Lifetime of Books,'' was recently at one of her son's hockey games in Glen Burnie, a suburb of Baltimore, when she noticed a copy of Diana Gabaldon's ''Outlander'' lying open on the bleachers.
 When a friend returned to claim it, Ms. Johnson asked for an opinion. ''She said it was fabulous,'' Ms. Johnson recalled. As soon as Ms. Johnson got home, she moved the title up her ''to be read'' list.
 ''I don't know that I would start a conversation with someone about something they were reading on an e-reader,'' Ms. Johnson added. ''It might not be something that they want anyone to know that they're reading.'' 
 Some digital publishers suspect that one of the reasons romance and erotica titles are so popular in electronic editions is because e-readers are discreet. 
 Book jackets, though, still matter. 
 Holly Schmidt, president of Ravenous Romance, an e-book publisher of romance and erotica, said that in one case the publisher was offering an anthology of stories about older women and younger men. The first version featured a digital cover image of a winsome woman. It barely sold any copies. The publisher put a new cover up online -- this time showing the bare, muscular torsos of three young men -- and sales took off. 
 The new cover ''took a book that was pretty much a loser,'' Ms. Schmidt said, ''and made it into a pretty strong seller.''

HEADLINE: Weak Rules On Toxins And Safety

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT

 BODY:
For 14 years until just last month, GlaxoSmithKline sold a denture cream called Super Poligrip that contained high levels of zinc.
 The zinc helped with adhesion and was probably safe so long as people used moderate amounts of cream. Indeed, the human body needs small amounts of zinc to function. But some people ended up using much larger amounts, and they began to develop the kind of nerve damage associated with excess zinc.
 Johnny Howell of Winston-Salem, N.C., who was using a tube of Poligrip a week, had to quit his job as a car mechanic and now needs a walker to get around his house. He is 53 years old. Rodney Urbanek, another Poligrip customer, began using a walker in 2007, at age 63. He died a year later, apparently a result of a copper deficiency from ''zinc overload,'' according to his autopsy.
 Now, the science here still is not completely clear. One researcher I interviewed said he wanted to see more evidence before being confident that Poligrip was the problem. Other researchers said they thought the causal chain was clear. Poligrip has a lot of zinc. Too much zinc causes copper deficiency. A lack of copper causes nerve damage. 
 Either way, the evidence has become strong enough that last month GlaxoSmithKline -- which also makes Tums, Nicorette and the country's top-sellingasthma drug -- stopped making the version of Poligrip with zinc, after having previously resisted just such a move. In Japan, responding to regulators' concerns, the company has also recalled from stores any remaining zinc-infused cream.
 All of which makes you wonder: did it have to come this?
 Every society needs to make a choice about how to prioritize consumer safety. If you try too hard to avoid problems, you can end up stifling daily life. Outlawing gasoline, for instance, would doubtless reduce pollution and respiratory disease, but no one is suggesting such a step. Europe, with its hostility to genetically modified foods, arguably errs on the side of being too cautious about chemicals and other such substances.
 But the United States clearly seems to be on the other side of the line. We are not taking toxic risks seriously enough.
 Several common diseases, like certain cancers and developmental disorders, have been rising in recent decades, and scientists are not sure why. In some cases, evidence suggests chemicals may be the reason.
 Nobody can be sure, though. The science is not far enough along, partly because our regulation of toxins is so limp. Companies don't have to release much of their internal safety data. And regulators face a terribly high burden of proof. They can often take action only after they have demonstrated that a substance is harmful -- a task that corporate secrecy can make impossible.
 ''I can get information on only 20 percent of chemicals we interact with on a daily basis,'' says Alan Goldberg, a toxicologist at Johns Hopkins. Erik Olson, a food and consumer product expert at the Pew Charitable Trusts, sums up the situation this way: ''We're a heck of a lot closer to the Wild West than the nanny state.''
 The story of denture cream and zinc is a good example. A dentist in the Navy noticed the link between zinc and copper deficiency in the 1950s, according to Dr. Harold Sandstead of the University of Texas in Galveston. Studies in later years confirmed the relationship. Early last decade, researchers made the connection from excess zinc to copper deficiency to neurological problems. ''It's nothing new,'' Peter Hedera, a Vanderbilt University neurologist, told me. ''If you researched the field, you would find out.''
 In 2008, Dr. Sharon Nations of Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas and other researchers published a study in the journal Neurology that took the research one step further. It specifically tied denture cream to severe neuropathy. Dr. Hedera followed up that study with another one analyzing 11 patients with high, unexplained zinc levels. To his surprise, all 11 turned out to be heavy users of denture cream.
 Yet even after those studies appeared, GlaxoSmithKline continued to sell Poligrip. The company simply inserted a small piece of paper into the product's box containing some mild statements that barely even seemed to be warnings. The headline on the insert was, ''For Best Results Start With a Small Amount.''
 Perhaps even more questionable than GlaxoSmithKline's response has been that of Procter & Gamble, the giant consumer products company that also makes Crest, Tide, Pampers and Head & Shoulders. Procter is still selling a denture cream with zinc in it. Why? The cream, Fixodent, has only about half as much zinc as Poligrip did.
 Even so, it may be enough to cause problems. Some of the 11 patients in the Hedera study were Fixodent users. ''I would withdraw both'' -- not just Poligrip but also Fixodent, Dr. Hedera says.
 The companies' argument all along has been that if people use moderate amounts of cream, they will be fine. ''All Fixodent products are safe to be used when used as directed,'' Michelle Vaeth, a company spokeswoman, says. GlaxoSmithKline didn't take more aggressive action because it ''did not want to cause alarm,'' said Nick Kronfeld, the company's medical director. ''The product has been safe and effective when used according to the label's directions.'' GlaxoSmithKline halted manufacturing as soon as it considered the science to be persuasive, he added.
 But given the vagueness of the instructions, the reality of how closely people read fine print and the levels of zinc involved -- ''really high,'' says Jane Flinn, a biopsychologist at George Mason University -- the companies sure seemed to be taking a risk with their customers' health.
 Mr. Howell, the former mechanic, who is suing GlaxoSmithKline, said he was careful to apply the cream how the instructions showed. He was less careful, however, about dosage. One of his lawyers, Stephen McCarthy, told me the packaging did not previously contain specific instructions about how much to apply. GlaxoSmithKline did not dispute this. 
 Today, Mr. Howell has to rely on friends to drive him to the grocery store. ''Before all this started happening, I used to have a race car and I used to go fishing all the time,'' he said.
 ''Now, I can't drive. I wrecked my car because my legs wouldn't hit the brake. I tore the whole side of my car off.''
 It's too late to prevent much of whatever damage has been caused by denture cream. But it is not too late to prevent the next such problem, and there will be a next one. Companies are just not going to regulate themselves. Their mission is to make money, and they pursue it well. They have shown again and again -- with lead in paint, mercury in canned tuna and zinc in denture cream -- that they are less zealous about protecting consumer safety. Many executives choose to believe, and to publicize, the studies that make their products look good, while casting doubt on studies that don't.
 Fortunately, there are some reasons for optimism. Lisa Jackson, the E.P.A. administrator, appears to take toxic risks more seriously than recent predecessors.
 Congress also plans to take up a bill this year that would update toxic regulations. As my colleague Charles Duhigg has reported, recent court rulings have helped neuter the existing regulations. The chemical industry seems less opposed to a regulatory overhaul, in part because lax regulation may help low-cost Chinese chemical companies more than American firms.
 Needless to say, new regulations have their drawbacks. They could deprive us of products that would have made life better or cheaper and that, despite some early indications to the contrary, turned out to be perfectly safe. Think for a minute about all the Poligrip users who liked the product, were using it without problems and can't do so anymore.
 On the other hand, if you have a friend or family member with dentures, don't you wish GlaxoSmithKline and Procter & Gamble had been more up front about the apparent risks?

HEADLINE: Oil Prices Find a Sweet Spot for the World Economy

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

 BODY:
HOUSTON -- Oil prices have done something remarkable over the last half-year or so: they have barely budged.
 Memories are still fresh of the chaotic climb to $147 a barrel only two summers ago, accompanied by gasoline costing $4.11 a gallon. The spike led to accusations from drivers and politicians that oil companies were price-gouging. Then crude prices plummeted along with the economy, to around $34 a barrel just over a year ago, only to double again in a matter of months as confidence began to recover.
 And there the price has stayed, more or less, since August, reaching a rough stability in the $70 to $83 range. 
 Economists and government officials say that if prices remain in that band, it could benefit the world economy, the future security of energy supplies and even the environment. The price is high enough to drive investment in future oil production and in supplies of alternative energy, they note, but low enough that consumers can bear it.
 ''It's a sweet spot,'' said Kenneth S. Rogoff, a Harvard professor of international finance. ''It's not too low that it's crushing demand for renewable energy sources or causing debt and fiscal crises in oil-exporting countries. And it's not so high that it's driving African countries deeper into poverty and threatening the recovery in the U.S. and Europe.''
 Gasoline prices have stabilized along with oil prices, with the average national price for a gallon of regular gasoline ranging from $2.50 to $2.80 since June. Prices are expected to go as high as $3 a gallon during this summer's driving season. That is a relatively high price by historical standards, but it is more tolerable than in the summer of 2008, when prices exceeded $4 a gallon for weeks, and rose above $4.50 in a few states.
 Oil prices have jumped somewhat this week, but they are still within the band they have occupied for months. Light, sweet Texas crude closed on Tuesday at $82.37 a barrel.
 Energy experts say that several far-flung global developments have converged to put supply and demand in relative equilibrium, at least for the time being.
 Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries have remained fairly disciplined in complying with their announced production cuts. Meanwhile, among non-OPEC producers, growing oil output in Brazil, Russia and the Gulf of Mexico has counterbalanced production declines in the North Sea, Alaska, Venezuela and Mexico. 
 On the demand side, growing appetites for oil in China, India and other developing nations have been offset by declining demand in the United States and Europe, because of their slowing economies, conservation efforts and growing use of biofuels. 
 ''The current price range provides a geopolitical benefit,'' said David L. Goldwyn, the State Department coordinator for international energy affairs. ''With ample capacity in oil, and commercial inventories at five-year highs, markets are well positioned to absorb any potential supply disruption, even without resorting to strategic stocks.''
 While the last four decades have been punctuated by various oil price booms and busts stemming from oil embargoes, wars and recessions, periods of relative stability lasting months or years have been commonplace. 
 Not surprisingly, oil producers prefer stability to plan their investments. ''The worst thing that happens in our industry is volatility,'' said G. Steven Farris, chairman and chief executive of Apache Corporation. With prices stabilizing, his company has increased its exploration and development budget by 50 percent, to $6 billion, this year.
 The new return to balance is rooted in the price spike that occurred from 1999 to 2008, when oil prices climbed from under $20 to nearly $150 a barrel. Those high prices performed their elementary economic function: they called forth additional supply.
 As prices rose, producers invested in expensive exploration and production projects around the globe. At the beginning of the last decade, fewer than 20 drilling ships were capable of finding and developing deepwater oil; today there are well over a hundred. Saudi Arabia and Russia undertook big expansions of their production capacity.
 When oil prices suddenly collapsed in late 2008, future supply gains were put in doubt. Several large companies postponed decisions on whether to go forward with big projects to develop oil sands in Canada, for instance, and smaller independents slashed their exploration budgets.
 But now most of the suspended oil sands projects are going forward, with an estimated 580,000 barrels of new capacity under construction. Meanwhile, many of the independent oil companies are pumping up their oil exploration investment budgets as well.
 ''If we still had $35 oil prices, you would not have seen us be nearly as active in the Gulf of Mexico,'' James T. Hackett, chairman and chief executive of Anadarko Petroleum, said in an interview. With prices recovering, he said his company was moving forward with an aggressive program of installing 30 deepwater exploration and appraisal wells this year in the Gulf, Asia and Africa, each costing $50 million to $200 million. 
 ''An $80 price curve tends to work for us,'' Mr. Hackett added.
 The biggest long-term threat to the new balance is growing consumption in China and other developing countries. But some analysts express hope that such countries can curb their oil demand growth as they build power transmission lines that will enable them to replace inefficient diesel generators with alternative power sources like gas and nuclear. 
 Stable, relatively high prices also may encourage conservation. Energy experts note that American drivers still have an incentive to buy efficient vehicles with gasoline prices at $2.80 a gallon, while high oil and low natural gas prices are encouraging use of compressed natural gas vehicles and biofuels in many countries.
 ''The price range we are in is positive for encouraging diversity of supply,'' said Mr. Goldwyn, the State Department energy official. ''It's high enough so that countries that subsidize the price of oil still have a high incentive to reduce those subsidies and it's high enough to support energy-efficiency measures that are positive for mitigating climate change.''
 For all the good that stable prices can do, however, no one is willing to predict they will last forever.
 ''Demand will change; supply will change,'' said Christof Ruhl, chief economist of BP, the oil company. ''The world changes all the time.''

HEADLINE: Disappointed, City Will Stop Paying the Poor for Good Behavior

BYLINE: By JULIE BOSMAN

 BODY:
An unusual and much-heralded program that gave poor families cash to encourage good behavior and self-sufficiency has so far had only modest effects on their lives and economic situation, according to an analysis the Bloomberg administration released on Tuesday. 
 The three-year-old pilot project, the first of its kind in the country, gave parents payments for things like going to the dentist ($100) or holding down a full-time job ($150 per month). Children were rewarded for attending school regularly ($25 to $50 per month) or passing a high school Regents exam ($600). 
 When the mayor announced the program, he said it would begin with private money and, if it worked, could be transformed into an ambitious permanent government program. 
 But city officials said Tuesday that there were no specific plans at this time to go forward with a publicly financed version of the program. In an announcement at BronxWorks, a nonprofit social services agency, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg pointed to a few examples of success: High school students who met basic proficiency standards before high school tended to increase their attendance, receive more class credits and perform better on standardized tests; more families went to the dentist for regular checkups.
 But the elementary and middle school students who participated made no educational or attendance gains. Neither did high school students who performed below basic proficiency standards before high school.
 ''If you never fail, I can tell you, you've never tried new, innovative things,'' Mr. Bloomberg said. ''And I don't know that this is a failure. I think it is, some things worked, and some things didn't, and some things the jury's still out on. And anything new you're going to have that diversity of results.''
 While payments to the families will end in August, researchers will continue to monitor them for three more years, to see if any behavior encouraged by the initial payments will continue. A final report will be issued in 2013. 
 The mayor has been applauded for his openness to innovative approaches to fighting poverty; one in five New York residents are poor.
 But from the beginning, the program set off controversy. Conservative critics asked whether it was wise to pay people for simple behavior like going to parent-teacher conferences or doctor's appointments; some liberals considered the approach condescending. The mayor, a believer in incentives in business and government, was determined to try it, but he avoided using public money initially.
 The program was certainly expensive: Mr. Bloomberg and Linda I. Gibbs, the deputy mayor for health and human services, traveled to Mexico to learn more about Oportunidades, the welfare program there on which the New York City effort was based.
 About $40 million in private donations, including from Mr. Bloomberg's foundation, was collected to finance the effort, called Opportunity NYC Family Rewards. Two years into the program, more than $14 million had been paid out to 2,400 families. An additional $10.2 million is for operating costs, and $9.6 million for research and evaluation.
 While most behavioral changes were not large, the cash provided to the families had a short-term effect: Those who participated earned, on average, more than $6,000 a year in the first two years. Largely as a result, those participating families were 16 percent less likely to live in poverty. 
 The families used the money to pay for basic living expenses, school supplies, electronic equipment and going to the movies, among other things. 
 More than 80 percent of the families were led by a single parent, 43 percent had three or more children and just over half of the parents held jobs. All lived in low-income areas in the Bronx, Brooklyn and Manhattan. 
 The program had a bumpy start, city officials and donors said. It was hard to recruit families from the beginning, said Margot Brandenburg, an associate director of the Rockefeller Foundation, the primary source of financing. 
 ''I think people were confused, and there was some amount of distrust,'' Ms. Brandenburg said. ''For some people it sounded too good to be true. It took a while to explain to people what the offer was.'' 
 Ms. Gibbs said many families had been perplexed by the guidelines that were laid out for them. Cash payments were eventually eliminated for actions like getting a library card and follow-up visits with a doctor.
 ''Too many things, too many details, more to manage in the lives of burdened, busy households,'' Ms. Gibbs said, standing next to the mayor on Tuesday. ''Big lesson for the future? Got to make it a lot more simple.''
 The city has been somewhat sensitive about the results of the program. Ms. Gibbs and other city officials cautioned that the report released on Tuesday reflected only initial results, and said that they were in line with other early results from similar conditional cash transfer programs in Latin America. 
 ''There have never been these overnight, miraculous turnarounds,'' Ms. Gibbs said. ''These are programs that are working on deeply entrenched, long-term behaviors.'' 
 One Brooklyn family who participated in the program said they collected more than $7,610 in two years. Janice Dudley and her 16-year-old daughter, Qua-neshia Darden, of East New York, said they received rewards for school attendance, good test scores and receiving regular medical checkups. 
 ''It gives children the motivation to want to go to school because they know they're going to get something back,'' Ms. Dudley said, adding, ''We might have a little problem next year when we don't have money on the card.'' 
 Mr. Bloomberg sounded philosophical on Tuesday as he spoke about the challenges that fighting poverty presents. 
 ''You always hope that you'll come across a magic silver bullet, and you never do,'' he said. ''If there were simple solutions, somebody would have found them a long time ago. And you make progress incrementally, particularly if you're trying to focus on some of society's biggest problems.''
