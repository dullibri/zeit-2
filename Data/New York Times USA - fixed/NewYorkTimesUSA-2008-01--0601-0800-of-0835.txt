HEADLINE: European Central Banker Says Inflation Is Still Focus

BYLINE: By CARTER DOUGHERTY

DATELINE: DAVOS, Switzerland 

 BODY:
The president of the European Central Bank gave a full-throated defense Wednesday of the bank's determination to fight inflation, quashing hopes -- at least for now -- that it might follow the United States Federal Reserve in cutting interest rates to contain an economic slowdown.
 Jean-Claude Trichet, the central bank president, said the bank, which hinted this month that it might raise interest rates, needed to focus on keeping inflation low, an approach that he argued would help calm increasingly chaotic financial markets. 
 The stance offered a sharp contrast to the Fed, which has shifted its focus over the last six months from fighting inflation to kick-starting the American economy. The Fed aggressively eased interest rates further in an emergency move Tuesday.
 Unlike the Fed, which is required by law to promote employment while keeping prices stable, the European Central Bank's sole role is that of a sentinel against inflation.
 ''Particularly in demanding times of significant market correction and turbulences,'' Mr. Trichet said in testimony to the European Parliament in Brussels, ''it is the responsibility of the central bank to solidly anchor inflation expectations to avoid additional volatility.''
 European markets sold off sharply on Mr. Trichet's remarks, which damped investor hopes that the bank would follow the Fed's lead. The CAC 40 in Paris and the DAX in Germany closed down more than 4 percent. 
 The Fed's move, which reflected a dire view of the state of the American economy, raised pressure on the European bank to concede that the slowdown an ocean away would drag down Europe, where the major countries are expected to show slightly softer economic growth after two years of robust performance.
 Mr. Trichet did take care to note that slower growth and slackening demand among consumers and corporations could damp inflation. By this logic, if the European economy did weaken, the bank would have room to lower rates.
 Early this month, the European bank kept its benchmark interest rate at 4 percent. Mr. Trichet even threatened to raise rates if European labor unions sought pay increases to compensate for higher food and energy costs. Still, financial markets have already assumed that the central bank will follow the Fed later this year.
 Through bets on short-term securities, traders have bet that the bank will lower rates beginning in April, and follow through with additional cuts in the summer and autumn. That probably reflects a conviction that the bank is waiting out the early rounds of wage negotiations -- a spring ritual in Europe -- before shifting its stance to accommodate a worsening economic outlook. 
 ''The E.C.B. is not really signaling that it will raise rates here, just threatening to -- a bit like having a nuclear weapon,'' said Julian Callow, chief Europe economist at Barclays Capital in London.
 The bank has consistently played down the danger to the European economy posed by weakness in the United States, citing trade within the 15-country euro area and buoyant demand from Asia for euro-zone exports. A rising number of economists in Europe have begun to dispute this view, citing surveys of business and consumer confidence that hint at weaker growth.
 The widening difference in interest rates has become fodder for debate at the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum here over whether financial authorities are up to managing both financial market chaos and a worsening economic outlook.
 Nouriel Roubini, a professor at New York University, said the European Central Bank had fallen far behind in a world where monetary policy takes up to 18 months to have an effect.
 ''The E.C.B. is still on hold,'' Mr. Roubini said. ''I believe they are behind the curve.''
 C. Fred Bergsten, the director of the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, offered context as well to a slowdown in the world's largest economy. If emerging markets lose one percentage point of growth this year, when an American recession and the credit squeeze are factored in, and rich countries average growth of 1.5 to 2 percent, the result is 4 percent global growth, hardly a lame showing, Mr. Bergsten noted.
 ''It is inconceivable -- repeat, inconceivable -- to get a world recession,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Veto Stands On Measure To Expand Health Plan

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Democrats cited the nation's economic problems as a reason to expand a popular health insurance program for children on Wednesday, but their effort failed as the House sustained President Bush's veto of a bill to provide coverage to nearly four million uninsured children.
 The vote for the bill was 260 to 152. Supporters were 15 votes short of the two-thirds majority needed to pass the measure over the president's objections. 
 ''Amid this economic downturn, with skyrocketing energy costs, a record number of mortgage foreclosures and fewer new jobs, the rate of unemployment has jumped dramatically,'' said Representative Allyson Y. Schwartz, Democrat of Pennsylvania. ''Two-thirds of unemployed individuals lose health care coverage for their families when they lose their jobs. In times like these, the State Children's Health Insurance Program is needed most.''
 Republicans said the vote was a political stunt, intended to embarrass Mr. Bush before his State of the Union address next week.
 The bill would pump $35 billion more into the child health program, providing a total of $60 billion over the next five years. The money would allow states to cover nearly four million children, in addition to the six million already on the rolls. The program helps families that earn too much to qualify for Medicaid, but not enough to afford private insurance.
 Democrats made impassioned pleas for the bill as a way to alleviate hardship caused by the nation's economic woes. But they did not convert any Republicans. On Oct. 18, when the House sustained the president's veto of a similar bill, 44 Republicans voted for it. By contrast, on Wednesday, 42 Republicans voted with 218 Democrats to override the veto.
 Some Republicans said the nation's economic problems strengthened their case against the bill.
 ''We will come back to this floor in the next week or two with a $150 billion economic stimulus package to get us out of a recession,'' said Representative Phil Gingrey, Republican of Georgia. ''We need the money for that. We don't want to be squandering money to provide health insurance for those who can afford to do it for themselves.''
 In his latest veto message, Mr. Bush said the bill would ''result in government health care for approximately two million children who already have private health care coverage,'' from employers or other sources.
 Mr. Bush welcomed the House vote on Wednesday and criticized the bill, saying it would have expanded the program ''to higher-income households while increasing taxes.'' The bill would have increased the cigarette tax by 61 cents, to $1 a pack.
 Representative Dave Camp, Republican of Michigan, said the need for the bill was less urgent because Congress in December extended the child health program through March 2009, with enough money to continue coverage for all current beneficiaries. 
 But Democrats said that was inadequate.
 ''Worsening economic conditions will increase demand for the Children's Health Insurance Program and Medicaid,'' said Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, Democrat of New York. ''A million more children a year may need public health insurance.''
 The child health program was created with bipartisan support in 1997, and two Republican senators, Charles E. Grassley of Iowa and Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, helped write the bills vetoed by Mr. Bush. The legislation became a symbol of ideological differences.
 Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California said that the bill fulfilled ''our moral obligation to our children.'' Other Democrats said the nation had a duty to cover those who could not afford insurance, with children having the first claim on available resources.
 But the House Republican whip, Representative Roy Blunt of Missouri, said the bill was ''aimed more at paving the way to government-run health care than making sure poor kids have access to adequate care.''

HEADLINE: Foreclosures Prompt Cities To Make Plea For U.S. Aid

BYLINE: By IAN URBINA

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Facing a collapse in the subprime mortgage market that has pockmarked their cities with vacant houses and crippled their budgets, the nation's mayors pleaded Wednesday for a huge infusion of federal aid.
 As more than 250 mayors gathered in Washington for the winter meeting of the United States Conference of Mayors, many agreed that the collapse of the subprime market had left a growing problem of vacant houses, depressed property values, tighter credit, and a need to cut services to close municipal budget gaps.
 ''It's an economic tsunami that is hitting our cities,'' said Mayor Douglas H. Palmer of Trenton, the president of the conference. ''We need federal action not six months from now, but within the next 30 days.'' 
 The conference called on Congress to raise the limits on loans bought by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to stimulate the mortgage market, and increase Community Development Block Grants to help stabilize neighborhoods. 
 In December, the conference released a study that said that home values would drop by $1.2 trillion in 2008, hitting city budgets the hardest. States are also beginning to suffer; on Wednesday, the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities in Washington reported that at least 16 states had predicted budget shortfalls for 2009 totaling over $30.1 billion.
 ''We're the ones left boarding up these places, cutting their grass, doing demolition on the abandoned structures, picking up the trash, making sure no one breaks in,'' said Mayor Frank Jackson of Cleveland. 
 Cuyahoga County, Ohio, which includes Cleveland, has more than 16,800 homes that have been abandoned because of foreclosures. 
 ''Anything from the federal government short of a massive infusion of resources into urban centers to rebuild infrastructure and pay for services is too little, too late,'' Mr. Jackson said.
 Speaking to the group, Robert E. Rubin, a former Treasury secretary, urged the mayors to be more aggressive in pressuring Washington for strong federal action, particularly in reviving the housing market. 
 Mr. Rubin said the government needed to provide more aid to homeowners struggling with mortgage payments.
 The subprime mortgage problem has left many cities scrambling to cut services to try to close budget gaps.
 City officials in Sacramento have responded to a $55 million projected budget shortfall for next year city by ordering an immediate hiring freeze and an end to some discretionary spending. 
 In Virginia, Fairfax County is facing a $220 million deficit for the coming fiscal year and is considering cuts to school districts. 
 This month, Baltimore's mayor and City Council announced plans to sue Wells Fargo Bank, contending that the bank's lending practices discriminated against black borrowers and led to a wave of foreclosures that has reduced city tax revenues and increased its costs. 
 Cleveland has sought monetary damages from 21 lenders.
 ''By driving down the value of nearby homes, foreclosures also drive down city revenues and place additional financial burdens on the city and its residents,'' said Mayor Sheila Dixon of Baltimore. ''It is our responsibility to do what we can to stop it.''
 Mr. Palmer said the conference had not taken an official stance on the issue of cities suing lenders. He said that Trenton had had a 14 percent increase in foreclosures in the past year but that suing did not seem prudent because litigation would take at least two years. 
 He said cities should require lenders to pick up the cost of upkeep for abandoned properties after foreclosures occur.

HEADLINE: Nice Resume. Have You Considered Botox?

BYLINE: By NATASHA SINGER

 BODY:
IN a new self-help book called ''How Not to Look Old,'' chapter headings in screaming capital letters warn readers of the dreaded signs of aging that are to be avoided at all costs.
 ''NOTHING AGES YOU LIKE ... FOREHEAD LINES'' admonishes one chapter introduction. Another chapter cautions: ''NOTHING AGES YOU LIKE ... YELLOW TEETH.''
 Nothing, apparently, also carbon-dates you like GRAY BROW HAIRS or SAGGING SKIN or RECEDING GUMS, according to the book written by Charla Krupp, a former beauty director at Glamour who writes a column for More, a magazine for women over 40.
 The book is the latest makeover title to treat the aging of one's exterior as a disease whose symptoms are to be fought to the death or, at least, mightily camouflaged. But the book offers a serious rationale for such vigilant attempts at age control, arguing that trying to pass for younger is not so much a matter of sexual allure as of job security. 
 ''Looking hip is not just about vanity anymore, it's critical to every woman's personal and financial survival,'' according to the book jacket.
 Promoted recently on Oprah Winfrey's show and ''Today,'' the book clearly speaks to the fears of professional obsolescence and economic vulnerability among women over 40, at whom it is aimed. ''How Not to Look Old'' made its debut on the New York Times best-seller list last week at No. 8 in the advice and how-to category. 
 ''Whether we want to admit it or not, in male corporate America we would rather have a cute, sexy 30-year-old working for us than a 50-year-old with gray hair who has let herself go and looks out of it, not in the swing of it, like a nun,'' said Ms. Krupp, a blonde who blurs her age by personifying her advice about donning highlights, bangs, heels and sheer lip gloss. After all, nothing ages you like dark lipstick.
 ''My book is hitting a nerve because I am giving not looking old a spin as if your life depended on it,'' Ms. Krupp said in an interview last week.
 Many people would shun a book if it were titled ''How Not to Look Jewish'' or ''How Not to Look Gay'' because to cater to discrimination is to capitulate to it. But the success of ''How Not to Look Old'' indicates that popular culture is willing to buy into ageism as an acceptable form of prejudice, even against oneself.
 ''Ageism is one of the last frontiers of discrimination where people think that a way around it is not to be seen to age, but we would never say that women should try to look or act more male in order to avoid sexism,'' said Molly Andrews, a psychologist who is a director of the Center for Narrative Research at the University of East London. 
 Dr. Andrews is the author of a 1999 paper titled ''The Seductiveness of Agelessness,'' published in Ageing & Society, in which she argued that encouraging people to mask their age constitutes a form of ageism in itself. ''People who are held up as models of aging well are those who are not seen to age,'' she said.
 The success of ''How Not to Look Old'' comes on the heels of disparaging comments about Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton made by the radio provocateur Rush Limbaugh, who last month said: ''Will Americans want to watch a woman get older before their eyes on a daily basis? And that woman, by the way, is not going to want to look like she's getting older, because it will impact poll numbers.''
 Although Mr. Limbaugh's comments drew widespread criticism, they underscored the idea that older women in the work force are vulnerable to age prejudice.
 In one study on hiring practices, for example, a graduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology applied to entry-level jobs in Boston and St. Petersburg, Fla., by sending out 4,000 resumes as a female job applicant; the resumes varied the year of high school graduation, which dated the job seeker as being from 35 to 62. 
 The study, published in 2005 by the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College, found that younger women were 40 percent more likely to receive an offer of a job interview than women over 50; a woman over 50 in Boston would have to send in 27 resumes just to get one job interview, where a younger woman would have to send in only 19, the study said.
 ''Seeming young can definitely help your economic status, and that pays the rent,'' said Joanna N. Lahey, the author of the study, who is now an assistant professor of public policy at Texas A & M. 
 A half-dozen women interviewed for this article said that they had chosen to use age-control techniques either because their jobs demanded it or because they simply disliked the physical changes attendant with age.
 ''The only way to age gracefully in my business is to die young like Natalie Wood or James Dean, but Shelley Winters or Marlon Brando could not get a job on the Food Network right now,'' said Joy Behar, a talk-show host on ''The View'' on ABC. 
 Ms. Behar suggested that working women today are held to beauty norms that are more stringent than in previous generations because of trends in longevity, fitness and cosmetic medicine. ''I'll do Botox and Restylane injections, but my motto is, 'I won't go under.' I won't do anything that involves anesthesia.'' 
 Indeed, the real trend behind ''How Not to Look Old'' is the rebranding of aging from biological inevitability to outmoded lifestyle option.
 And even for women who said their jobs had not dictated the choices they made about their looks, techniques to mask their age may improve their currency. 
 ''In 1985, I saw a tape of myself where my eyes were puffy,'' said Faye Wattleton, the president of the Center for the Advancement of Women, a nonprofit group in Manhattan. ''I looked very tired and bedraggled and not as youthful as I would like to have been.'' 
 Ms. Wattleton said she had an eye lift at that time, followed about five years ago by a lower face-lift. ''I didn't do it because I was worried I would lose my job,'' she said. ''I did it to make a better appearance, a fresher appearance, a more youthful appearance.''
 Ms. Wattleton, 64, described people's outward aging and their decisions to ameliorate it as personal choices that others should not judge.
 ''Being a person who has had plastic surgery and goes to the gym five days a week to work my muscles up so they don't look atrophied as a 6o-year-old, I don't disparage people who want to maintain their appearance,'' said Ms. Wattleton, a former director of Planned Parenthood. ''But what I don't want is a society that tells me I have to.''
 Ms. Krupp argues that economic pressures require most women to adopt age-management techniques. As her book puts it: we cannot afford to let ourselves go! 
 ''What are we going to do if we have to enter the work force at a ripe old age?'' Ms. Krupp said last week. ''Out of necessity, you can disguise the age you are by looking younger, hipper and fresher.''
 She added that Americans of one class, religion or ethnicity have often tried on other identities if they appeared to confer some professional or economic advantage.
 ''There was a book on how not to look Jewish,'' Ms. Krupp said. ''It was called 'The Preppy Handbook' and it was a best seller.'' 

GRAPHIC: PHOTOS: Just like clothing and hairstyles, the aging face is subject to fashion trends, as evinced by popular television shows over the last 50 years. Characters played by Rose Marie, top right, Mary Tyler Moore and Candice Bergen, right, had frown lines and crow's feet
but Calista Flockhart, left, and Lucy Liu, seem wrinkle free. As for real women today, Joy Behar of ''The View'' said: ''You can't have a job like mine on TV and not have some Botox. I don't know anyone who hasn't.'' (PHOTOGRAPHS BY CLOCKWISE FROM TOP RIGHT: EVERETT COLLECTION

HEADLINE: Percy's New Orleans and Mine

BYLINE: JULIA REED


HIGHLIGHT: Walker Percy wrote about the South better than anyone I've ever read.

 BODY:
Walker Percy wrote about the South better than anyone I've ever read.What I did not know until I moved to New Orleans, though, and bought ahouse in the Garden District, is how spot on a portrayal of the cityand its residents "The Moviegoer" really is. I've always considered ita funny novel, but now I find myself laughing at everything. There'sWalter, Kate's fiance feeling all proprietary about the house hethinks may one day be his, squatting on his heels, checking out thebaseboard, "calculating the angle of the settle." As the world nowknows, the land beneath most houses in New Orleans closely resemblespudding - I spend a great deal of my own time squatting on my ownheels, looking at the dipping baseboards with a wary eye. Then thereis Binx's cousin Eddie Lovell and his wife Nell. "Nell has taste,"Binx says, and with those three words I can see her before me, thisinveterate house fixer-upper and flipper, improving the archetypalshotgun houses of New Orleans with old brick and sugar cane kettles,shutters in the bathroom and swinging saloon doors in the kitchen. Ihave been in countless of those very same spaces.
While all these details are a delight, the most telling ones by farare about the segment of society that Binx's Aunt Emily and her familyrepresent. The Cutrers's mantelpiece contains the photographs andmomentos of their "grand slam year," when Uncle Jules was king of Rex(the Krewe of Rex was founded in 1872 to coincide with the visit ofRussian Grand Duke Alexis Romanoff, and to be its king is the highesthonor of the Mardi Gras season); Kate was queen of Neptune (whichdoesn't actually exist - some of the krewes are so loaded withcomplicated signals about class and so on that he probably didn't wantto risk naming a real one for fear of what it would conjure up in theknowing reader's head); and Aunt Emily was awarded the Picayune Cupfor her work with the "Home Service" (the Times-Picayune still givesit out, most recently to the founder of the Women of the Storm).Similar mantelpieces still exist throughout this neighborhood: mynext-door neighbors have a glass case in their front parlor containingthe crown and gown the lady of the house wore when she was a queen.During the carnival season, which is now upon us, past royalty fliesthe flag of their krewe - three of them are visible from the window inthe office where I'm writing.
In the 1950s, not long before Percy would have started "TheMoviegoer," Robert Tallant wrote in "The Romantic New Orleanians" thata great number of the more "exclusive" society folks "frequentlybehave toward the rest of the population as if they were a rulingwhite colony temporarily residing among the natives of the Fijiislands." Despite my zipcode, I am definitely a Fijian. To be part ofNew Orleans society you must still be born to it, a fact that hascontributed to our awful economy. When the oil moguls of Houstonresided here during the city's brief heyday as an oil-and-gas capital,they were appalled to find they couldn't get into the old-line men'ssocial clubs and krewes like the one Walter describes as a "damn goodbunch of guys," whose older members are "among the ten wealthiest andprominent families in New Orleans." First they formed their own club,the Petroleum Club, but finally they got so irritated at theprovincialism and misplaced hauteur of their social "betters," theyjust packed up and moved out.
Though, as my fellow blogger Dean Baquet points out, the Cutrers'sclass lost political control of the city a long time ago, they stilllive in an almost parallel universe, a place where everything from thehouse you live in and your position in carnival royalty to your waiterat Galatoire's is inherited. Folks still eat fish (or shrimp po-boys)on Fridays and red beans and rice on Mondays; they wear poplin andseersucker after Easter but never before; and they eat oysters atFelix's or the Acme - but never both. In an environment whereeverything is dictated by ritual or blood, gumption, any kind ofentrepreneurial spirit, even free will goes out the window.
Dean said all this in a much pithier way than I have, and the onlyplace I differ with him is that I think he gives the scions of theCutrer class too much credit - I'm not sure they spend too much timetrying to figure out how to measure up or feel especially burdened bytheir ancestry. I'm sure some do (in fact, I know some who do), but Ithink most are either just plain stifled by it and get out of Dodge -or they pick up the traditions and happily soldier on. So while Idon't completely agree that the Garden District crowd isrepresentative of a certain sort of restlessness, I do think it is anexcellent choice of setting in which to place characters like Binx andKate, for contrast if nothing else. Given the backdrop it starts tomake sense that someone with Kate's sensibility is happiest on ananonymous bus rolling through Mississippi after her fiancee is killedin a car wreck. (I will now risk the wrath of all my neighbors andbitchily say that having been to a ball much like the one Kate skipsin favor of going to the movies with Binx, I too would prefer themovie house.) And even though they settle not far from Aunt Emily inone of Nell's shotguns of all things, they still escape the tyranny oftheir class, because, after all, they're onto something.

HEADLINE: Insiders' Insights Are Glum

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and economics in his blog at norris.blogs.nytimes.com.

DATELINE: DAVOS, Switzerland 

 BODY:
 The closer you are to financial markets, the glummer you are.
 This has not been an unreservedly negative year at the World Economic Forum, the annual gathering of business and economic leaders at this ski resort, even if Klaus Schwab, the major-domo of the event, did feel called upon to try to cheer up attendees at the forum's formal opening.
 ''I know the mood is different from last year,'' he said, ''but we do not want to fall into gloom and doom.'' 
 Many have not done so. There has been optimism from some American business executives, who say they have yet to see weakness in their sales. Richard N. Cooper, an economist from Harvard, said his best guess was that while the American economy was slowing, it would not fall into recession. He said he doubted that consumer spending would really contract so sharply that it would bring down the economy. 
 Others forecast that the rest of the world will keep growing even if the American economy tanks. 
 ''This is the first time that the world is looking at a possible American recession with two engines of growth: China and India,'' said Kamal Nath, India's minister of commerce and industry. 
 ''The momentum of growth is increasing year by year,'' he added. ''It will take a great recession to stop this momentum.''
 But the pessimism is much greater among those closest to the financial system. While some take a functioning financial system for granted, in the same way they view highways or indoor plumbing, others see a system in crisis.
 ''We're entering a perfect storm, a period of financial turbulence and very limited capital,'' said one executive, whose company needs to borrow money to grow.
 ''What's driving everyone crazy,'' another executive said, ''is, you don't know who you can trust.'' Both are well-known executives who did not want to call attention to themselves. 
 The new lack of trust has virtually closed down the securitization system that financed many companies and many mortgages. It has shaken other markets, where traders worry that counterparties -- the people they trade with -- will not be able to perform on contracts that may require large payments years later.
 ''It's like walking blind in a minefield,'' said Nouriel Roubini, a New York University economics professor who warned of an impending credit crisis at this conference a year ago. ''You have no idea if your counterparty has a lot of toxic waste, or not much.''
 Established financial markets dealt with that issue generations ago by using exchanges and standardized contracts. The exchange monitored the health of its members and guaranteed the trades. If you put in an order to sell 100 shares of I.B.M., it doesn't matter to you if the buyer defaults. You will get your money anyway.
 But in the over-the-counter market for financial derivatives, each trade depends on the counterparty. Many deal only with established banks, and the banks are expected to monitor the standing of the people they trade with.
 Until this summer, it was easy to trust the banks. The Basel II capital guidelines for banks, now being phased in around the world, even relied on the banks' own credit evaluations to decide how much capital they needed to back a given loan.
 But what appeared to be a well-capitalized financial system has turned out to be the opposite, as big bank after big bank has had to seek huge capital infusions. Securities that banks had been able to keep off balance sheets -- Mr. Roubini says regulators should never have allowed such things -- have come back just in time to provide large losses.
 ''We did not,'' an executive of one financial institution said, ''fully understand the extent of the risks'' in some securities. For obvious reasons, he did not want to be identified.
 The newest big loss shows the problem is spreading. 
 On Thursday, Societe Generale, the big French bank, reported that it had to write down 2 billion euros because of the same kind of problems that have besieged American banks. That was bad enough, but it also said it lost 4.9 billion euros from trading in European stock index futures. Societe Generale said a trader had exceeded his trading limits. 
 The lack of trust has intensified because some banks offset big risks by purchasing insurance against defaults, and now the insurance seems dicey. The so-called monoline insurers, like MBIA, are in danger of losing their AAA ratings, and some have already done so.
 Even worse, at least potentially, are the risks from credit default swaps, which have become a $45 trillion business. George Soros, the legendary hedge fund manager, called in reporters here to warn that some of those swaps had been sold by hedge funds that might be unable to pay if there were a wave of defaults by corporate borrowers. 
 His proposed method of dealing with that seemed unlikely to win approval, but it was interesting because of the extent of fear it showed. 
 He wants bank regulators to go in and audit the big financial institutions, and then either close them down or give them clean bills of health, with explicit guarantees of their positions. Then traders would know some counterparties were safe.
 That such an idea could cost the Treasury billions, or give big financial advantages to the favored banks, or even amount to practical nationalization, did not seem to bother Mr. Soros. He is worried about the possibility of ''systemic collapse.''
 The fear at this forum is among the financiers.

HEADLINE: Home Prices Sank in 2007, and Buyers Hid

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
The median price of an American single-family home fell in 2007 for the first time in at least four decades, according to the National Association of Realtors, a trade group. 
 ''It's the first price decline in many, many years,'' the group's chief economist, Lawrence Yun, said Thursday. ''And possibly going back to the Great Depression.''
 The median price of a single-family home fell 1.8 percent, to $217,800, the first annual decline since reliable records began in 1968.
 And even as prices plummeted, buyers vanished. Over all, sales of previously owned single-family homes dropped 13 percent in 2007, the biggest decline in a quarter-century. (The group's survey excludes newly constructed homes.) 
 Economists now say the housing market, plagued by its worst downturn since the early 1990s, will not bottom out until at least the summer, and even then sales are expected to remain sluggish.
 ''Housing activity remains weak,'' said Mickey Levy, chief economist at Bank of America. ''What more can be said?''
 Last month alone, total sales dipped 2.2 percent from November, slowing to a 4.89 million annual rate. Condominium sales were off 25 percent from the year-ago period. 
 Home sellers are grappling with a combination of elevated inventories and tighter lending standards, which make it harder for potential buyers to take out a mortgage. Concerns over the health of the economy have not helped: a slowdown may make Americans more reluctant to undertake large purchases.
 ''The weak demand is reflecting uncertainty about the economy, higher unemployment, and expectations prices are going to fall further,'' Mr. Levy said.
 Though the backlog of unsold homes ticked down slightly in December, at least one economist attributed the drop to discouraged homeowners ''pulling their homes off the market in the face of continued weak demand and falling prices.''
 ''We still have a long way to go before prices sink to levels necessary to balance supply and demand in the housing market,'' the economist, Joshua Shapiro of MFR, wrote in a research note.
 The Northeast suffered the steepest decline in sales last month, with purchases down 4.6 percent from November. Prices in the region have fallen 8.9 percent from December 2006.
 Compared with December 2006, sales dropped 21 percent in the South, 25 percent in the West, 20 percent in the Midwest and 22 percent in the Northeast.
 The median price of a single-family home in December was $206,500, down from $207,300 in November.

HEADLINE: Weighty Role on the World Stage

BYLINE: By PETER S. GOODMAN

 BODY:
Not long ago, many experts were convinced that a vibrant world economy would prevent an American recession. Even if the beleaguered American consumer suddenly turned thrifty, they reasoned, healthy spending on other shores was supposed to keep the expansion rolling.
 But now, with the turmoil in financial markets resonating around the world, those same experts see signs that economic growth abroad will probably not be strong enough to prevent the United States from slipping into a recession.
 Indeed, the very global interconnections that many thought might spare the United States now appear to be working in reverse: American consumers will pull back from their exuberant spending, cooling demand for goods worldwide, dragging down the global economy. This could in turn stifle foreign demand for American goods.
 ''Exports had been seen as the one strong sector of the American economy,'' said Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital. ''Now there's a sense that the American contagion is spreading abroad.'' 
 For all the furious economic activity in China and India, the recent upheaval is a reminder that the American consumer remains a central engine of the global economy, the chief appetite for goods and services that has kept factories humming, mines at full production and cargo holds full of products. 
 But in recent weeks, several signs have emerged suggesting a slowdown throughout the global economy. The price of oil, after spiking at $100 a barrel, has lately pulled back, reflecting an expected dip in demand for energy. 
 The price of shipping important commodities like coal, iron ore and grain has dropped sharply over the last three weeks, though it still remains high by traditional measures, according to the Baltic Exchange Dry Index, a much-watched gauge of shipping prices that is seen as an indicator of global demand. And in Asia, exporters like Chinese garment companies and Japanese equipment makers are reporting slower demand from the United States.
 All of which suggests there still is no substitute for the American consumer. Yes, China and India are developing rapidly, adding millions of newly middle-class people yearning for goods like pillowcases and laptop computers. Latin America and Australia are enjoying a bonanza supplying raw materials to factories from Asia to Eastern Europe. Russia and the Middle East are selling energy at near-record prices, spending the proceeds on the wares of the world.
 American companies could surely exploit this growth, the theory ran. Even if consumers at home went into hibernation, buffeted by rising unemployment and the sagging value of real estate, companies could still count on strong sales abroad. 
 Much of this narrative may still be true, and yet, as stock markets in Shanghai, London and New York plummeted in a bout of panic selling this week, it suddenly seemed an inadequate fix for what ails the economy.
 Consumer spending amounts to about 70 percent of the $14 trillion American economy. This stream of money has in recent years brought in a widening basket of imports -- electronics and textiles from Asia; cars and luxury goods from Europe; energy from anywhere it can be found. 
 American companies have capitalized on this reality. As Korean firms assemble cellphones destined for American shelves, they use chips designed and forged in the United States. 
 Caterpillar, the construction equipment company based in Peoria, Ill., sells earth movers used to dig out iron ore from the red earth of western Australia, sending it to China to feed smelters. American companies sell oil-drilling gear that is harvesting energy in places like Saudi Arabia and Indonesia.
 All of this activity has rested to a considerable degree on the willingness of Americans to buy. Time and again, that force has proven spectacularly resilient. Even as the dot-coms disintegrated and the economy fell into recession seven years ago, American consumers kept spending. Even as housing prices fell and debt levels climbed, Americans continued to head to the mall.
 But the latest indicators point to a slowdown in consumption. This, say economists, is predominantly why markets around the world have been recoiling. 
 Several arteries of wealth that have given consumers the wherewithal to spend are rapidly drying up. During the years of the real estate boom, Americans pulled more than $800 billion a year out of their homes through refinanced mortgages, home sales and home equity lines of credit. Falling housing prices have drastically shrunk that pool. A slowing job market has deprived spenders of the means to buy. 
 Now, fresh data shows that Americans have been tapping their credit cards aggressively, while increasingly falling behind on the payments.
 ''As they use up their available credit, they have no other source of spending,'' said Ellen Zentner, United States macro-economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi in New York. ''Credit cards are their funding of last resort.'' 
 From the end of 2005 through the fall of 2007, the share of consumer credit card debt that was delinquent ticked up to 4.3 percent, from about 3.5 percent, according to data from the Federal Reserve. From the beginning of 2006 through the end of last year, growth in the use of consumer credit cards surged to 7.4 percent, from 2.6 percent in annualized terms. 
 Other credit available to consumers has been shrinking sharply, according to an analysis by Ms. Zentner. The pool of unused credit -- predominantly home equity lines of borrowing, bank loans and credit cards -- was still growing at nearly 15 percent annually as recently as the fall of 2006. Now, with debt mounting, home prices falling and job growth slowing, that pool is diminishing at an 8 percent annual rate.
 ''At the consumer level, this situation really is untenable,'' said Robert J. Barbera, chief economist at the research firm ITG. ''We've gone from equity extractions to credit cards to where now consumers are actually going to have change the trajectory of their spending.''
 If thoughts of a newfound American thrift helped scare world markets this week, so did continuing worries about the extent of losses facing banks as the mortgage crisis spreads. Here, too, what was once seen as the moderating force of global connectedness has gone malignant.
 Back when house prices were going up and banks were aggressively writing mortgages, they spread their risks by selling their loans to investors around the globe. That was once a source of comfort; now, it means the losses could be hiding in any banking balance sheet in any country. 
 ''There's so much uncertainty about where the risks lie,'' Ms. Zentner said. ''It smacks too closely of another Asian financial crisis when you get rumors of big write-downs by a Chinese bank.''
 The story fed into larger fears that banks worldwide would be reluctant to lend, choking economic growth, even with sharply lower interest rates delivered by the Federal Reserve. If nobody can calculate with confidence how big the mortgage losses will be, then no one really knows how much cash they must reserve against bad loans. No one can tell whether business prospects will keep souring, making banks cautious with their funds. 
 ''The real fear is that there's a kind of total systems meltdown,'' said Michael Darda, chief economist at MKM Partners. ''There's a real sense that we just deteriorate from here and fall deeper and deeper into the abyss.''
 From Mr. Darda's perspective, the fear has become the poison itself: he thinks markets worldwide have severely overreacted to the downturn in the United States, pointing to declines in new claims for unemployment insurance inarguing that the job market is healthier than many believe.
 New jobs, he says, will be more important than credit cards or home loans. If so, it could prove comforting. But it means the global economy still rests on the back of the American consumer.

HEADLINE: With a Day of Steady Gains, U.S. Stocks Join in a Global Rebound

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
The Dow Jones industrial average spent most of Thursday in positive territory, and the major American markets closed near their highs for the day as investors extended a global financial rally that began Wednesday afternoon. 
 The Dow closed up 108.44 points, or 0.9 percent, to 12,378.61, and the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed 1 percent, to 1,352.07. The Nasdaq composite index gained 1.9 percent, closing at 2,360.92, as technology stocks surged on strong earnings reports from Qualcomm and Xerox.
 It was a relatively quiet day for the markets after two wildly volatile sessions. Unlike recent trading sessions, Thursday's numbers involved no sudden 300-point swings. 
 Much of the day's action took place in the commodities markets. With investors expecting the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates again when it meets next week -- futures markets now predict a half-point reduction -- gold, oil, corn, lumber and other metals and goods became more attractive. 
 Lower interest rates make it easier for businesses and consumers to get money, pushing down the value of the dollar. Many commodities are traded in dollars; when investors expect the dollar to weaken, they look to snap up commodities as a hedge against inflation. 
 Gold gained $22.53, to settle at $912.85 a troy ounce. Crude oil futures rose $2.42, to $89.41 a barrel, after several days of declines. The euro also gained against the dollar.
 Energy stocks led the day's gains, while shares of financial companies continued to improve modestly after surging late on Wednesday.
 ''This is part of a bounce you're going to have in a very, very oversold market,'' said Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at the Hartford, the financial services firm. ''The big question is whether or not the market can stay on an uptrend, or does it fizzle out?''
 Ms. Krosby said investors would be closely watching volume levels at the major exchanges over the next few days. ''Volume represents conviction,'' she said. 
 Thursday's volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 2.18 billion shares, and advancing issues outnumbered decliners four to three.
 The major European indexes closed up 4 percent or more and have almost completely recovered from the steep losses they suffered on Monday, when fears about an imminent recession in the United States led to a broad sell-off.
 The FTSE 100 index in London gained 4.75 percent and the benchmark DAX index in Germany moved higher by 5.93 percent. 
 Major Asian markets also recorded overnight gains, with the Nikkei 225 in Tokyo up 2 percent.
 Investors in the United States may also have been buoyed by a drop in unemployment claims, a leading indicator of the job market. The claims fell more than expected last week, the Labor Department reported on Thursday, suggesting that January payrolls might not have fallen as much as analysts feared. 
 But the good news was balanced by the bad: sales of previously owned homes in 2007 fell to their slowest pace in a quarter-century, the National Association of Realtors said. 
 Over all, sales fell 13 percent in 2007, and the median price of a single-family home declined for the first time in at least four decades.
 Investors worldwide continue to closely monitor the movements of central banks in the United States and Europe. The chairman of the European Central Bank has signaled that he is unlikely to cut interest rates, citing concern over rising inflation, just two days after the Federal Reserve surprised investors by slashing its benchmark rate by three-quarters of a percentage point. 
 The benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 28/32, to 104 15/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 3.70 percent, from 3.60 percent.
 Following are the results of Thursday's Treasury auction of 20-year inflation-protected securities:

HEADLINE: Study Says Private Equity Isn't Big Job Killer

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

DATELINE: DAVOS, Switzerland 

 BODY:
Among the world's private equity kings and policy makers, the issue of whether buyouts create jobs or result in more layoffs has always been the $100 billion question.
 In perhaps the most extensive study conducted on the issue, the World Economic Forum plans to announce on Friday the results of yearlong examination of 5,000 private equity transactions from 1980 through 2005. 
 The answer? Well, the study found that private equity does not create more jobs, but the Gordon Gekko stereotype may be too harsh. Companies owned by private equity, shed on average, about 1 percent more jobs than their peers. 
 The study, ''Economic Impact of Private Equity,'' was led by Josh Lerner, professor at Harvard Business School, and Steven J. Davis, professor at the University of Chicago's Graduate School of Business. Commissioned a year ago, the study is intended to create a set of measurements to further the debate about the impact of private equity amid the buyout boom. 
 The study was guided by an advisory board that included policy makers, academics, labor representatives and private equity executives. 
 Among the most interesting findings: two years before a buyout, a company cuts, on average, 4 percent more of its work force compared with its peers, probably because it is struggling or trying to prepare for a sale. 
 After a buyout, the numbers muddy just a bit. The acquired company, on average, cuts 7 percent of its work force over two years, but at the same time, it added jobs -- usually new positions and in new locations -- at a pace of about 6 percent, resulting in a net loss of 1 percent. By the fourth and fifth years of private equity ownership, the growth of a company's work force becomes similar to its public peers. The study did not look at new or lost jobs abroad. 
 While the results run counter to the ''buy it, flip it, strip'' image of private equity, some buyout executives had been hoping for an even more glowing report. 
 ''I thought the numbers would be more positive,'' said Joseph L. Rice III, chairman of Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, who led the study's advisory board. ''A fair conclusion from the numbers is there is no pluses or minuses. You wouldn't say that private equity is the demon that some say it is, nor would you say it is the savior.'' 
 Other private equity executives said the study did not examine what would have happened to employment had the buyouts not occurred. 
 Some other findings appear to raise more questions than answers. According to the study, 6 percent of all buyouts eventually end in a bankruptcy filing, slightly higher than the average for public companies. However, compared with those public companies with similar junk debt ratings, buyout companies defaulted at half the rate. 
 The study also put into perspective the recent buyout boom. While the news media often focus on large deals that move public companies into private hands, such deals reflected only 6.7 percent of the total number of buyouts since 1980. Measured in terms of dollar value, public-to-private transactions represent 28 percent of the firms acquired. 
 The World Economic Forum's study comes a week after the private equity industry released its own report examining 42 large companies acquired by eight private equity firms from 2002 to 2005. That study, commissioned by the Private Equity Council, a lobby group, showed that employment grew 8.4 percent among acquired companies. The two studies did not examine the same deals; the World Economic Forum's study, which was based on Census data, did not look directly at deals from 2003 to 2005. 
 Mr. Lerner, comparing the two reports, said in an interview that the samples in the industry-backed study, ''were selected by the buyout groups, as opposed to being random chosen.''
 He said that since the industry study looked at only a small number of transactions, ''it is natural to worry about 'selection biases' in a setting such as this, especially given the visible and highly charged nature of the discussion about employment and private equity.'' 
 In a statement released at the time of its study, Douglas Lowenstein, president of the Private Equity Council said of Mr. Lerner's study, ''Our intent is to complement his work and to make a positive contribution to the global discussion about the economic impact of private equity -- on job growth, productivity, innovation and many other important metrics.'' 
 It is unclear how unions, which have criticized private equity, will react to the report, which does not appear to favor its conclusion that the industry slashes jobs. 
 At the time of the industry-backed study, Stephen Lerner, director of Service Employees International Union's private equity project dismissed it.
 ''This study is part of a multimillion dollar lobbying plan by an industry on the defensive,'' Mr. Lerner said. ''There is little reason to trust and no way to verify self-reported claims by the super-secretive buyout industry.''

HEADLINE: Senators Criticize U.N. Program in North Korea, but Question Set of Accusations

BYLINE: By WARREN HOGE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
A Senate subcommittee criticized the United Nations Development Program in North Korea on Thursday, accusing it of lax management and poor accountability. 
 But the panel raised serious questions over accusations by the United States Mission to the United Nations that the agency had squandered millions of dollars there.
 The panel, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, concluded that the program depended excessively on staff members chosen by the North Korean government, that it broke its own rules in using foreign currency rather than local currency, and that it lacked sufficient administrative and fiscal controls and resisted auditing. 
 In a report, the subcommittee cited general ''management and operational deficiencies'' as leaving the agency ''vulnerable to manipulation by the North Korean government.''
 The program shut its operations in North Korea in March when the country resisted a decision by the development program to stop furnishing payments in hard currency and to stop making local hiring subject to government approval.
 But much of the hearing on Thursday focused on charges made last year by Mark D. Wallace, an ambassador at the United States mission to the United Nations, in briefings for members of Congress, news outlets, the State Department and nations that finance the development program.
 Mr. Wallace said then that $2.8 million of program funds had been sent to North Korean missions abroad for the purchase of buildings in Britain, France and Canada; that $2.7 million had been paid to a North Korean financial agent responsible for sales of missiles and arms; and that more than $7 million had been transferred to a North Korean committee it worked with.
 Mr. Wallace compared the program to the scandal-ridden oil-for-food program in Iraq and suggested that the United Nations money might have ended up financing the North Korean nuclear program.
 The subcommittee staff report on Thursday said that in fact the $2.8 million sent abroad to buy real estate was actually North Korean, not United Nations, money, and that the amount of money sent to the company suspected of financing arms was $52,000, not $2.7 million.
 It also accepted the program's explanation that the link to arms sales of the suspect contact, the Macao-based Zang Lock Trading Company, had not been known at the time.
 The report said the North Korean representatives had told the committee that their government used a United Nations bank reference as a way of avoiding detection at a time in 2002 when the country had just been labeled by President Bush as a part of the ''axis of evil'' and feared its power to transfer funds abroad would be restricted. The United Nations had no knowledge of the transaction, the report said. 
 At the hearing the chairman, Senator Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat, pressed Mr. Wallace repeatedly to say whether, with what he knew now, he could still make the same charges he had made last year. 
 Mr. Wallace said that he did not know the specific amounts of money involved because of the difficulty of tracking transactions in North Korea, and added that they could be even higher than he had estimated.
 In an interview outside the hearing room, Mr. Levin expressed frustration at the answer.
 ''I gave him a chance on at least three occasions to acknowledge that some of the points that he made back in May were inaccurate at the time, perhaps based on information that he interpreted, but that nonetheless, he could not make those statements now,'' Mr. Levin said.
 ''That doesn't mean he lied,'' Mr. Levin added. ''It does mean that he said things at the time that he now knows are not accurate.''
 In a separate interview, Mr. Wallace said he could not answer the question under oath because he was uncertain about the real figures, and he suggested the committee had been naive in its conclusions.
 Disputing the subcommittee's finding that the $2.8 million sent abroad did not belong to the United Nations Development Program, he said: ''The documents say it's the U.N. imprimatur money. The North Koreans and now the U.N.D.P. say, 'Well, maybe those documents are not accurate.' 
 ''I didn't make those documents, the North Koreans did, and they want us to believe it is not U.N. money. If you want to give them the benefit of the doubt, I would submit that I have a bridge for you in Manhattan that I'd sell you for $2.7 million.''
 The ranking Republican on the committee, Senator Norm Coleman of Minnesota, said he thought the United Nations in North Korea had a ''keep your wallets open and your mouths shut attitude to the rest of the world.''
 He said the conduct of the program showed ''how rogue regimes try to manipulate the U.N. as much as they can,'' adding, ''If they were able to use U.N.D.P. as a cover to funnel money, what other rogue nations were able to subvert the system?''

HEADLINE: Wolfowitz to Lead Panel at State Dept.

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Paul D. Wolfowitz, former president of the World Bank, will lead a high-level advisory panel on arms control and disarmament, the State Department said Thursday. 
 Mr. Wolfowitz, who has close ties to the White House, will become chairman of the International Security Advisory Board, which reports to the secretary of state. The panel is charged with giving independent advice on disarmament, nonproliferation and related subjects.
 The portfolio includes commentary on several high-profile issues, including pending nuclear deals with India and North Korea and an offer to negotiate with Iran over its disputed nuclear program.
 Mr. Wolfowitz was replaced as World Bank chief last June after a stormy two-year tenure. He is now a defense and foreign policy studies expert at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative Washington research organization.

HEADLINE: Changing Tone, AT&T Plays Down Effect of Less Spending

BYLINE: By LAURA M. HOLSON

 BODY:
Heads turned on Wall Street on Thursday as AT&T executives tempered earlier statements about the expected impact of lower consumer and business spending on their business.
 On Jan. 8, shares of AT&T slid 4.5 percent after Randall L. Stephenson, the chief executive, said at a conference that some customers were having their phone service turned off because of unpaid bills, indicating a weakening economy. But in a conference call after the release of AT&T's earnings on Thursday, the company played down those concerns. 
 It emphasized instead the predictable nature of telephone company stocks, which are less vulnerable than those of luxury goods makers or real estate companies during a recession. 
 Rick Lindner, the chief financial officer, said AT&T, like other communications companies, was indeed seeing the impact of a softer economy on its operations. But, he added, ''they are not very severe at this point.'' Even in a downturn, consumers are going to want to stay connected, either online or on the phone. ''I think for us that continues to point to more of the defensive nature of our business,'' he said.
 AT&T reported strong fourth-quarter earnings that met analysts' expectations, with net income rising 63 percent, in large part because of the growth in wireless communications. Revenue hit $30.3 billion in the quarter ended Dec. 31, up from $15.9 billion for the same period in 2006. The increased revenue reflects AT&T's acquisition of BellSouth and the consolidation of its wireless operations. The company now has 70.1 million customers. 
 AT&T gained 2.7 million new wireless customers in its fourth quarter, up 13.5 percent from a year earlier, Mr. Lindner said, adding that 40 percent of customers buying Apple's iPhone, which is sold exclusively through AT&T, are new to the company. 
 Wireless data revenue increased 57.5 percent from a year earlier as customers sent more e-mail messages by phone, downloaded videos and used the Internet on the go. 
 Analysts say wireless operations will continue to be a driver of growth. But if consumers get worried about the economy and cut nonessential spending, communications companies may see the impact in ways they do not expect. 
 Lisa Pierce, a vice president for Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass., said consumers could decide to forgo spending on mobile music and ring-tone downloads. Such services are moneymakers for companies like AT&T, which have watched the number of phone lines installed in homes shrink.
 ''Wireless has been part of the reason that revenues have been growing rapidly,'' Ms. Pierce said. ''Those companies want that to keep going.''
 If consumers do shy away from consuming entertainment on their phones, it could have a ripple effect through the media industry. Industry executives and analysts have been betting on mobile media to follow the trajectory of media on the Internet. As with anything in an uncertain economy, Ms. Pierce said, ''we'll have to wait and see.''
 Shares of AT&T fell 94 cents to close at $35.75 and continued falling after hours.
 Shake-Up at Sprint
 The chief financial officer of Sprint Nextel, Paul N. Saleh, and two other senior executives are leaving the company in a management shake-up, the company said Thursday.
 Mr. Saleh, who had served as acting chief executive, will leave Friday along with the chief marketing officer, Timothy E. Kelly, and Mark E. Angelino, president for sales and distribution, Sprint said.
 Sprint shares closed up more than 4 percent as some investors saw the departures of the marketing and distribution executives as a good sign. Sprint has struggled with marketing and customer service problems.
 The chief executive, Daniel R. Hesse, said he was reviewing strategy and would consider both internal and external candidates for the jobs.

HEADLINE: Economists' Critiques Of Emergency Effort Retrace Old Debates

BYLINE: By PETER S. GOODMAN and LOUIS UCHITELLE; Mark Landler contributed reporting from Davos, Switzerland.

 BODY:
Useful, but flawed and probably not enough: that, in general terms, was the verdict pronounced on the $150 billion emergency spending plan agreed to by the White House and Congressional leaders on Thursday in a bid to stimulate the suddenly sputtering economy.
 Most economists praised the deal as a necessary effort that by increasing the public debt to put cash swiftly into the hands of ordinary consumers, could limit the severity and duration of a recession and very likely spare some jobs. 
 Nonetheless, economists of nearly every ideological stripe also found substantial fault with the plan: liberals, because it does not expand unemployment benefits or food stamps; conservatives, because it fails to lock in President Bush's tax cuts beyond their planned expiration in 2010.
 Few economists thought the stimulus plan alone would be adequate to keep the economy clear of a recession. Yet many portrayed the package as a significant psychological boost for anxious markets around the world, a sign that the Washington overseers of the American economy are seriously engaged in finding a fix. 
 ''It is a much needed and very constructive step,'' said Lawrence H. Summers, the Treasury secretary in the Clinton administration who has recently called for specific and temporary tax cuts. ''It will provide some confidence. But policy-making will need to be on standby, because more may be needed.''
 The plan was a result of intensive horse-trading between Democrats and the Bush administration, bringing to the fore fundamentally competing notions about economic policy. But the basic goal was shared and simple -- keeping the economy growing at a time when millions of Americans are losing confidence and cutting back in the face of falling home prices, mounting debt and rising joblessness.
 At the center of the plan is an effort to spur consumers, whose spending makes up 70 percent of the American economy. The plan leans heavily on cash payments for all but the wealthiest Americans, assuming that money put in pockets will swiftly find its way into cash registers, generating jobs at restaurants, retail outlets and banks and on the factory floor.
 The most fervent proponents of free markets criticized the plan as a damaging intrusion by government that incurs public debt for dubious subsidies.
 ''The economy is working these things out,'' said David R. Henderson, a libertarian economist at the Hoover Institution at Stanford. ''We've got the housing crisis and the subprime, and all these things take a while to settle. The government just doesn't have the discipline to kind of let things work out.''
 But in recent weeks, mainstream economists from across the political spectrum have come to the conclusion that growing economic turmoil demands that significant public money be poured into limiting the pain of a downturn. 
 Still, the way the deal was cut left many bemoaning the compromises.
 Democrats had sought the extension of unemployment benefits and an increase in food stamps. Research shows these measures deliver the largest increases in spending, because poor people are prone to buy what they need when given the chance. Wealthy people, by contrast, tend to save more when taxes are cut.
 The Bush administration insisted on rebates alone, and House Democrats relented in exchange for adding payments to people who do not pay income taxes. 
 ''They gave up pieces of the package that were more effective,'' said Jared Bernstein, senior economist at the labor-oriented Economic Policy Institute in Washington, who blamed the Bush administration for blocking the expansion of benefits. ''It's a political choice, and a bad one. It's an ideology that says, 'I can get a lot more credit for tax cuts than I can for expanding unemployment insurance.' ''
 Unemployment among blacks and Hispanics has been rising at triple the rate for whites, while the time it takes for people to find new jobs has been lengthening, according to government data. Some experts argue that by failing to expand unemployment benefits, the plan leaves minority groups most vulnerable to a recession.
 ''It's way inadequate,'' said William Spriggs, an economist at Howard University in Washington. ''It doesn't fix the problems we have with the safety net.''
 Seven years ago, the last time the government handed out rebate checks in a downturn, recipients spent two-thirds of the money within six months, according to Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody'sEconomy.com. 
 This time, unlike the last, some of the money is going to people who do not pay taxes, so an even bigger surge of spending is likely, he said.
 ''This is a very positive, big step,'' Mr. Zandi said.
 But much has changed in recent years. Given that a lot of Americans are so deeply in debt, some economists said, many may use the money to pay off bills rather than to buy new goods and services. ''People are already behind on mortgages and credit cards,'' said Gary A. Hoover, an economist at the University of Alabama. 
 Another big factor is that an increasing share of goods sold in the United States are made overseas. During the 2001 recession, 18 percent of what Americans spent on food and manufactured goods was imported, according to the Commerce Department. By 2006, the share had risen to 21 percent.
 ''A great deal of any stimulus is going to be sent overseas,'' said Alan Tonelson, a research fellow at the United States Business and Industry Council, a trade association of small manufacturers that lobbies to limit imports.
 Other analysts argued that the best way to ensure that dollars do not leak abroad would be to spend them on state-financed public works projects employing large numbers of people -- repairing levees and dams, fixing bridges or building schools. 
 The money could also be directed to states that face shrinking tax revenues as the economy contracts. An infusion of federal money would allow them to sustain construction programs and social services for the poor.
 ''The first people to go in this squeeze are social workers, and that should not be,'' said Paul A. David, an economic historian at Stanford. ''When people are short of money or unemployed, they have trouble at home and need help.''
 Debate over the stimulus plan also tripped one of the key fault lines in American economic policy -- argument about the merits of tax breaks. 
 The Bush administration championed tax cuts for businesses, arguing that this would coax companies to expand. But many economists question that assumption, asserting that if consumers lack money to spend, then businesses will stand pat or even cut back and fire people, whatever the tax rate.
 ''Breaks in taxes for corporations are unlikely to make a difference,'' said Desmond Lachman, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute. ''There's waste in it.''
 But conservatives who expound the supply-side view expressed disappointment with the plan because it focused on temporary tax cuts rather than improving economic incentives through lower rates, which tend to benefit the wealthy the most. 
 Over the last quarter-century, Republicans have generally argued that the economy grows when money is freed up through lower taxes for all, businesses especially. Some argue that the prospect that a new administration will take office next year and increase taxes is damping investment now, stifling the creation of new jobs.
 ''One of the factors that's currently souring this economy is the prospect that taxes are going to be rising in the future,'' said William W. Beach, a senior fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation in Washington. ''I'm concerned about the bang for the buck.''

HEADLINE: All of America, And Parking Too

BYLINE: By JOE QUEENAN

 BODY:
WHEN people set out on a jaunt to a town they have never visited, they inevitably spend a short time touring some second-tier natural wonder -- be it crag or cataract -- or a building where Louisa May Alcott once slept, or a gimcrack museum containing the quill Washington Irving supposedly used to pen ''Rip Van Winkle.'' But mostly they spend their time shopping, because shopping is what Americans like to do. And when they are not shopping, they are eating.
 Given these facts, it is surprising how reluctant we are to think of a suburban mall as a suitable destination for a day trip. Because run-of-the-mill malls generally lack charm, are rarely shrouded in myth, and are usually teeming with boisterous teens, they are instinctively sneered at by the lofty-aspirations day-trip crowd. Yet a truly capacious, well-appointed mall, accepted on its own merits, has infinitely more to offer thrill seekers than those picayune hamlets that dot the landscape, with their solitary diner, dowdy bookstore, canny antiques dealers and dodgy museum. In this sense, malls may be our most overlooked diversionary resource. 
 I recently spent an entire day at the Palisades Center mall in West Nyack, N.Y., a megalopolis of roughly 250 stores just a bit northwest of New York City. Neither a mall lover nor a mall hater, I initiated this endeavor without prejudice, setting out to do things I would not normally do elsewhere, to buy things that might not have readily been bought in other places. 
 Purging myself, to the extent that this was possible, of all ironic preconceptions, I brought to this adventure the same level of excitement I would have brought to a jaunt to Mystic Seaport or Valley Forge. Perhaps even more.
 From the outside, the Palisades Center has little to recommend it. Vast, inert, lacking any discernible architectural theme, and plunked down next to the cheerless Interstate that leads to the Tappan Zee Bridge, the mall is often described as a series of interlocking coffins. The Brutalist exterior conveys the impression that some senescent, unemployed Eastern Bloc architect was summoned to the developer's office and threatened with severe reprisals against his family if he dared to introduce a single visual nuance suggesting that someone had actually designed the building. The visible trash gondolas that greet visitors when they enter from the I-287 side do not help.
 Inside the cavernous structure, things improve dramatically. With pipes and panels and air-conditioning vents laid bare, the four sprawling floors suggest a retail version of the Centre Pompidou. The gargantuan, airy building is built around a series of atriums, suggesting that it had been modularly assembled by an industrious but agoraphobic child. 
 Gigantic malls like this operate on the same principle as Manhattan: a small group of ugly buildings and you've got Akron; a large group of ugly buildings and you've got the Gotham skyline. Vastness was one of its original selling points; with so many stores, it was always envisioned as a tourist destination in and of itself, potentially rivaling the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minn., which boasts its own amusement park. (Actually, neither the Mall of America nor the Palisades can hold a candle to the 800-store West Edmonton Mall in Alberta, which has its own water park, more than 100 places to eat, a theme hotel and, yes, four submarines.) 
 The basic lineup at the Palisades mall, which opened in 1998, is that murderer's row of retail establishments replicated throughout this great nation: Target, Pottery Barn, Nine West, Ann Taylor, Barnes & Noble, Macy's. What gives the mall its cachet are the attractions that do not fit this generic model. The Ferris wheel on Level 3 is a good example; taking a Ferris wheel ride inside a mall before lunch is one of those experiences that defines the underappreciated concept of ''adult hooky.'' The same holds true for a midmorning skate around the ice rink that takes up a large part of Level 3. 
 Even more nostalgic is the bowling alley tucked away on the top floor. When you enter Lucky Strike Lanes, you cannot help noticing the waitresses in short skirts and spiky heels who serve drinks in its restaurant. But off to the side sit a dozen bowling lanes, and there an army of festive tykes can usually be found futilely hurling bowling balls down the lanes. Though I had not bowled in a quarter-century, I acquitted myself admirably, narrowly holding off a late charge from Brianna and Jasmine. Brianna was about 11, Jasmine perhaps 6. I take my victories where I can get them.
 Best Buy was an unexpected treat, because even though the compact disc business is dying, it is not dying fast enough to prevent some people from buying compact discs. Seemingly embarrassed to continue purveying such dismally anachronistic merchandise, Best Buy had stocked its vestigial supply of CDs in no particular order, with Carlos Santana abutting Esa-Pekka Salonen, John Coltrane arrayed next to Charlotte Church, and the Mahavishnu Orchestra lined up right beside Gustav Mahler's Fifth Symphony. 
 I picked up two dirt-cheap Elvis Costello rarities, three CDs by the British folk-rock legend Richard Thompson, a new rendering of ''Beloved Steppe Favorites'' by Valery Gergiev and the Kirov Orchestra, and the first album Wes Montgomery ever made. The 12 CDs -- none of which I needed, all of which I wanted -- set me back $125. Name a rustic village where I could make off with a haul of swag like that. Name one.
 The cashier at Best Buy told me that the best restaurant in the mall was a Japanese place on the top floor called East. Its selling point was a conveyor belt that trundled tasty comestibles past the diner at eye level; you simply grabbed whatever tickled your fancy and the waitress totaled up the damage later. The food was the usual predictable suburban sushi -- save for one memorable offering: the Philadelphia Roll, which consisted of salmon, caviar, avocado and the obligatory dollop of cream cheese. As is the case with just about every cheese steak or soft pretzel I have ever eaten outside the Delaware Valley, the Philadelphia Roll was culturally inauthentic but by no means inedible. Just for the record, however, and to mollify Keystone State purists, there is no such thing as a Philadelphia Roll, just as there is no such thing as Baked Alabama or a New Mexico Strip Steak.
 After dropping by Books Kinokunaya to page through some riveting special-interest magazines aimed at Japanese Goths, I spent a few minutes inspecting the oversized mariachi guitars and squeeze boxes at Rincon Musical. Rincon Musical is one of those lovable establishments that does not fit the Ann Taylor/Nine West template, a store whose very incongruity makes it a source of delight to the weary shopper. 
 I bought a Hohner harmonica that I intend to learn to play once I officially enter the crusty old varmint phase of my life, then headed down to the Pet Company to inspect the parrotfish. A fish lover from birth, but not enough of an ichthyophile to travel all the way from suburban Westchester to the Coney Island Aquarium, I relished the opportunity to watch these fugitives from the briny deep gambol and frolic. 
 The pet store, which also does a nice trade in schnauzers and Rottweilers, was ingeniously positioned between Kidzy City, a theme restaurant for the preadolescent set, and a tattoo parlor called Body Ink. This arrangement required toddlers to brush past stocky, self-involved young men whose supply of epidermis that had not been pierced or adorned in some way was rapidly dwindling, but who nonetheless lacked that aura of funereal menace long associated with tattooed men back in the Shanghai Pete and Vinny the Leech Era. As usual, the kids looked scarier than the guys marinated in body art.
 After the statutory consultation with one of those aggressive purveyors of Dead Sea salts that haunt such establishments, followed by a pit stop at the ethnic ice cream store, I strolled into the video arcade to rub shoulders with hoi polloi, who were well represented that afternoon. Then, eschewing the Imax theater, which was offering a thrilling program about dinosaurs, I took a merry carousel ride followed by a solitary game of pool.
 What I didn't do that day could have kept other visitors amused for hours -- sports-theme bars, upscale department stores, a gift shop specializing in heavy-metal accessories, and even a gallery displaying those ingratiatingly hideous paintings that make Norman Rockwell's work look as if he studied with Velazquez. I had covered all of my bases here -- culture, cuisine, Americana, nostalgia, irony, exfoliation; the only thing missing was the Louisa May Alcott connection. Or maybe not. 
 On the way back to my car, I happened to notice a tidy wave of gravestones on a hill that was otherwise completely engulfed by the parking lot. Mount Moor Cemetery, I soon discovered, was home to African-Americans, many of them war veterans from conflicts ranging all the way back to the Civil War. 
 Say what you like: Neither the Mall of America nor the West Edmonton Mall nor any other mall you can think of can boast of a 19th-century cemetery filled with African-American war heroes right in the middle. So take that, Cooperstown; take that, Amherst. I had entered the Palisades Mall in the morning expecting almost nothing; I left it at the end of the day filled with glowing respect. From Kidzy City to the Mount Moor Cemetery, this place has you covered from cradle to grave.

HEADLINE: Two Cheers For Wall St.

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
There is roughly a 100 percent chance that we're going to spend much of this year talking about the subprime mortgage crisis, the financial markets and the worsening economy. The only question is which narrative is going to prevail, the Greed Narrative or the Ecology Narrative.
 The Greed Narrative goes something like this: The financial markets are dominated by absurdly overpaid zillionaires. They invent complex financial instruments, like globally securitized subprime mortgages that few really understand. They dump these things onto the unsuspecting, sending destabilizing waves of money sloshing around the globe. Economies melt down. Regular people lose jobs and savings. Meanwhile, the financial insiders still get their obscene bonuses, rain or shine. 
 The morality of the Greed Narrative is straightforward. A small number of predators destabilize the economy and reap big bonuses. The financial system is fundamentally broken. Government should step in and control the malefactors of great wealth.
 The Ecology Narrative is different. It starts with the premise that investors and borrowers cooperate and compete in a complex ecosystem. Everyone seeks wealth while minimizing risk. As Jim Manzi, a software entrepreneur who specializes in applied artificial intelligence, has noted, the chief tension in this ecosystem is between innovation and uncertainty. We could live in a safer world, but we'd have to forswear creativity. 
 The United States has generally opted for financial innovation. This has worked out pretty well. The U.S. has enjoyed 25 years of strong economic growth, in part because capital has been efficiently allocated to companies that can use it well.
 Financial instruments like adjustable-rate and subprime mortgages have allowed millions of people to get homes they could not otherwise purchase, and research shows that most of these tools have been used intelligently.
 Hedge funds have proliferated to help investors manage risk. These things exist precisely because investors want to smooth out volatility. In the old days, a blow to, say, the Texas economy could have dried up lending in Texas, but now funds flow globally, and money from one part of the world can shore up weakness in another.
 As Sebastian Mallaby of the Council on Foreign Relations has pointed out, time and again hedge funds have dampened market instability. If a currency, a company or a stock market starts to spiral downward, deep-pocketed funds, smelling bargains, will come in and stabilize its assets. If a company's price is rising to unsustainable levels, contrarian funds bet against the hype. 
 Most of the time, the complex new instruments diversify risk and serve the public good. But life requires trade-offs, and, as we're being reminded this week, the innovation process involves a painful adolescence. 
 When a new instrument enters the market, it takes a while before people understand and institutionalize it. Whether the product is high-yield bonds or mortgage-backed securities, there's a tendency to get carried away. 
 In the first stage of this adolescence, investors look around and see everybody else making money off some new instrument. As Nicholas Bloom of Stanford notes: ''They assume they are fine because they see everyone else buying it.'' Individual bankers have a special incentive to get in on the ride because their yearly bonus is determined by how they do in the short term. 
 Then there's a moment when people realize how stupid they have been. They've bought a pile of subprime mortgages without really knowing what they've purchased. The ratings agencies suddenly don't look so reliable. The cycle of overconfidence becomes a cycle of underconfidence because nobody knows who is holding worthless paper.
 Then, finally, maturity sets in. Those who have lost great gobs of money get fired. People still find the new product useful, but within parameters and with greater safeguards.
 The lesson of the Ecology Narrative is that, in most cases, the market corrects itself. Maybe this year banks will change their pay structure so there's not so much emphasis on short-term results. Maybe companies will change their boards to improve scrutiny over complex new instruments. In short, markets adapt.
 People who embrace the Ecology Narrative don't like the offensive bonuses that get handed out on Wall Street. They just don't see any way the government can curtail them without rending the fabric of the ecosystem. They don't like the periodic crises, but don't see how government can prevent them without clamping down on innovation. The challenge is to give people the means to withstand the perturbations.
 The Ecology Narrative is not morally satisfying. I wouldn't bet on its popularity as a backlash against Wall Street and finance sweeps across a recession-haunted country. But the Ecology Narrative has one thing going for it. It happens to be true.

HEADLINE: An Expressionist in Albuquerque

BYLINE: By ROBERTA SMITH

 BODY:
Like Georgia O'Keeffe, Stuart Davis and others, Richard Diebenkorn went to New Mexico and had a breakthrough. He arrived in Albuquerque in January 1950, with his wife, Phyllis, and their young son. He had been teaching at the California School of Fine Arts but had decided to go to graduate school at the University of New Mexico, courtesy of the G.I. Bill, so that he could paint full time. He was 27 years old. 
 Diebenkorn's progress during his 30-month stay in New Mexico is the subject of a radiant hodgepodge of a show, full of striving, stumbling and sudden effortless glides at the Grey Art Gallery at New York University. Diebenkorn would later go on to make grander, more complex paintings, both figurative and abstract, than the ones here. But too many of these later works are tamped down by his studious reserve and exquisite touch; they balance on the cusp of vitality without really getting their feet wet. In many ways his painting was never freer, less predictable or more full of the future than in New Mexico. 
 By the time he got to Albuquerque, Diebenkorn was a fairly seasoned painter. As a young child growing up in San Francisco he had set his sights on becoming an artist and was steadily encouraged by his maternal grandmother, a lawyer who painted on the side. As an undergraduate at Stanford University he had made accomplished variations on Edward Hopper's chalky realism, bathing it in a sharp West Coast light. While at Marine training camp in Virginia in 1944 he had managed to immerse himself in the Phillips Collection in Washington and visited the Museum of Modern Art in New York.
 In 1946 he returned to San Francisco and studied at the California School of Fine Arts (later the San Francisco Art Institute) with David Park, who became a close friend and whose blunt figurative paintings influenced Diebenkorn's return to representation in the late '50s. The next year a travel grant enabled him to return to the East Coast and spend eight months in Woodstock, N.Y. (Greenwich Village rents were prohibitive.) Between widely spaced visits to the city, he spent 12-hour days in the studio ''teaching myself to paint,'' as he said later.
 In an essay for the exhibition catalog, the art historian Gerald Nordland describes Diebenkorn as ''one of the creative giants of the second half of the 20th century and among the most original of all modern artists.'' But Diebenkorn, who died in 1993 at age 70, may have come closer to the truth when he said: ''I'm really a traditional painter, not avant-garde at all. I wanted to follow a tradition and extend it.'' 
 In addition to his considerable painterly gifts, Diebenkorn had an eye for progressive art and a knack for synthesis. In New Mexico, away from the burgeoning art worlds of both San Francisco and Manhattan, he followed and extended Abstract Expressionism in works that emphasized the painting process in areas of layered color punctuated by darting lines, usually black.
 These works have a humor and even a feistiness absent from most of his other work. What is especially startling is that they assimilate a style Willem de Kooning had broached barely two years earlier in his famous black-and-white abstractions. 
 Diebenkorn had seen the de Koonings in reproduction in 1948, when he was intent on marrying line and brushwork in his own art. He was also interested in cartoon art; the books he took to New Mexico included one about George Herriman, creator of Krazy Kat. 
 The Grey Gallery show, the first to focus on this short but rich phase, originated in a larger version at the Harwood Museum of Art at the University of New Mexico. With 19 paintings, 24 works on paper and one sculpture, it contains much that is unfamiliar, including canvases that have been on public view rarely if at all.
 The marvelous ''Untitled (Albuquerque)'' from 1951, for example, has been exhibited only once since the Diebenkorn retrospective initiated by the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Rochester in 1976. It features a lower right quadrant of bright, brushy egg-yolk yellow over white and red to which a bubble-like outline adds a bulbous head. Upper left, a series of cursive lines and loops imply an outburst of language, culminating with a red F at the top edge that is really a pronged patch of color that escaped an incursion of white. And beyond all this an empty speech balloon bobs at the painting's edge, too small to contain the verbiage. 
 Herriman's art is a factor here and in other paintings. It is explicit in several ink drawings, including one in which a thick vertical line has another vertical in tow. Vertical No. 2 is under attack from above by a large star and a crescent moon; delicate splatters of ink imply profanity, speed or both.
 Diebenkorn always maintained that all his work was a reaction to reality, most often landscape. In New Mexico his colors brightened, his paint thinned, his line loosened and his compositions became actively improvisational. 
 The painting process was transparent, which was nothing new; it was in most Abstract Expressionist work. You could usually see all the way to the back -- the raw canvas -- of a Pollock drip painting, for example. But Diebenkorn added a more complicated awareness to the process, punctuating ragged blocks of layered color with lines and quasi signs, introducing irreverence and, at times, sexual innuendo.
 For example, in an untitled painting that Diebenkorn made in 1950, shortly after arriving in Albuquerque, a smudged black dot turns an area of yellow into a soft belly. Elsewhere, heavier surfaces might be undermined by unexpected holes that gave glimpses of earlier stages of the painting. In a small work from 1951, white kidney-bean gaps in a field of pink read as subterranean nests incubating ellipses of color -- a small green one and a larger sky-blue one -- while a darker pink shape at the top suggests a pair of women's underpants. In ''Untitled 'M' '' (1951), black ellipses are spread like dance steps across a mostly white field. 
 Diebenkorn used drawing to create a parallel commentary on and within the painting, a way to ''talk back,'' signal second thoughts or direct our attention. He encircled painted shapes with black lines for emphasis, crossed out forms or sprinkled in random X's, triangles, sudden loops and letter fragments. All these elements invite you to look more closely at the way the paintings have been made, layer by mark, creating lush physical narratives rife with jokes and asides.
 Mr. Nordland is right in his conclusion that the works in this show confirm, once more, that Abstract Expressionism was a national, not a New York painting style. But they also suggest that Diebenkorn tilted de Kooning's improvisatory style toward later developments, creating a variant of Abstract Expressionism that sidestepped the style's solemnity and its wholeness in favor of something more fractured and accessible. 
 These paintings foreshadow Color Field abstraction and Pop with their economy, their wit or their profusion of signs. They exhibit a self-consciousness of process and a willingness to mix high and low that would emerge more clearly at the end of the 1950s in the work of artists as diverse as Peter Saul, Cy Twombly and Jasper Johns. Diebenkorn, working alone in New Mexico, released some significant early warning signs. 
 ''Diebenkorn in New Mexico'' is on view through April 5 at the Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington Square East, at Waverly Place, Greenwich Village; (212) 998-6780, nyu.edu/greyart. 

CORRECTION-DATE: January 29, 2008

 CORRECTION:
An art review in Weekend on Friday about an exhibition of works by Richard Diebenkorn at the Grey Art Gallery at New York University misidentified the site of the Albright-Knox Art Gallery, which organized a Diebenkorn retrospective in 1976 in which a work at the Grey Gallery, ''Untitled (Albuquerque),'' was shown. It is in Buffalo, not Rochester.
An art review in Weekend on Friday about an exhibition of works that Richard Diebenkorn made when he was in New Mexico, at the Grey Art Gallery at New York University, omitted a family member who arrived with Diebenkorn in New Mexico in 1950. In addition to his wife and young son, his young daughter accompanied him.

HEADLINE: Throughout Asia, Exporters Brace For Tremors From a U.S. Pullback

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER; Martin Fackler contributed reporting from Tokyo and David Barboza from Shanghai.

DATELINE: HONG KONG 

 BODY:
Asian exporters are already feeling the effects of an American economic downturn -- effects that may be magnified by a weak dollar, volatile world markets and fears that more bad loans may be ticking in the coffers of American companies.
 Rather than waiting for things to get worse, companies from Chinese garment businesses to Japanese equipment manufacturers are changing how they operate. 
 The weakening American demand is clear. American orders for small tractors fell 5 percent last year at the Kubota Corporation in Osaka and are expected to fall further this year. Orders from the United States have been weak for a year at Top Form, the Hong Kong company that is the world's largest bra manufacturer. And at Aigret Industries, a manufacturer of multiline phone systems and fax machines in Xiamen, China, orders from the United States plunged 30 percent in the fourth quarter compared with a year ago. 
 In some Asian industries, the result has been deep gloom. At the Evergreen Knitting Company in Ningbo, China, orders from the United States for T-shirts and sweaters abruptly dropped 20 percent this winter. The company expects some rival Chinese knitwear producers to shut down altogether.
 ''We anticipate that this year, 10 to 20 percent of the knitwear factories will have to close due to the inability to compete,'' said Sean Zhu, Evergreen's sales manager.
 In response to the downturn, some companies are pursuing remedies that will affect economic output, like Aigret Industries, which has lengthened next month's Chinese New Year vacation for its workers to 20 days, instead of the usual 10.
 Others are investing in more technological research and developing new models, like the Xigo Electric Company in Zhongshan, China, which manufactures air-conditioners and liquid-crystal display television sets.
 ''We really felt the impact of the slowdown in the U.S. during the second half of 2007,'' said Stan He, a Xigo sales manager. ''Orders were generally down by 10 to 20 percent relative to the same period a year ago.''
 Asian exporters lie at the center of the debate in financial markets over the extent to which Asia has decoupled from the United States and can grow strongly even if the American economy slows significantly. The evidence so far is that the effects of an American slowdown will vary widely, depending on each country's reliance on exports and the extent to which each country's economy is currently overheating or stumbling.
 China, which has struggled in recent months with rising inflation, has actually benefited from slower exports -- although a steeper decline could prove a problem. The Chinese government announced on Thursday that growth eased to 11.2 percent in the fourth quarter, from 11.5 percent in the third quarter and 11.9 percent in the second quarter.
 The modest slowing, almost entirely because of less brisk growth in exports, helped reduce inflation to 6.5 percent in December from 6.9 percent in November, the government said.
 But with fixed-asset investment still soaring in China, Xie Fuzhan, the director of the National Bureau of Statistics, warned at a press conference in Beijing that China was still worried that overall growth was too fast to be sustained without inflationary pressures.
 For countries that were already struggling with weak growth and faced little if any inflation, like Japan, weak exports are proving a serious setback.
 ''Now we see 're-coupling,' '' said Tetsufumi Yamakawa, chief economist in Tokyo for Goldman Sachs. ''The economy of Japan is proving disappointingly fragile to external shocks.''
 China overtook Canada last year as the largest exporter to the United States. But year-over-year growth in Chinese exports to the United States slowed sharply last autumn, posting a gain of just 7 percent in November from a year earlier. That was only slightly greater than the appreciation of the Chinese currency against the dollar over the same period, suggesting that the actual volume of Chinese goods headed to the United States stagnated.
 For Japan, Malaysia, Thailand, Australia, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Cambodia and Indonesia, exports to the United States actually dropped in dollar terms in November.
 On Wednesday, Citigroup cut its average estimate for economic growth this year among Asian economies by four-tenths of a percent, while reducing its estimate for growth in the United States by seven-tenths of a percent, to 1.6 percent.
 The question across Asia is how much worse can it get. 
 Willie Fung, the chairman of Top Form, said that American stores were not oversupplied with bras after the Christmas season.
 ''Apparently it is not going from bad to worse. I hardly notice any changes over the past couple months as far as demand is concerned,'' he said.
 A few exporters are even upbeat.
 ''I have not seen orders go down from the U.S. or from Europe,'' said Alice Lam, a sales manager at the Shunde Growth Corporation, which assembles bookcases and other furniture in Shunde, in southeastern China, from imported Taiwanese steel.
 But many exporters are worried. Kubota is trying to increase sales of larger tractors and expand market share in Thailand, China and Europe to offset small tractor weakness in America.
 Fuji Heavy Industry, which makes Subaru cars, is also fretting. ''Our concern about the future of the U.S. economy is becoming very strong, though our sales aren't declining now,'' said Shinichi Murata, a Fuji spokesman. He said Subaru may offer incentives, like price cuts or better terms on car financing deals.
 China's garment industry is particularly wary.
 ''Because of the subprime crisis in the U.S., the U.S. economy is not as big as in years before -- a lot of Chinese textile companies are getting fewer and fewer orders from the U.S.,'' said Cao Xinyu, the deputy director of the China Chamber of Commerce for the Import and Export of Textiles.
 But executives at six different manufacturers said in separate telephone interviews this week that their biggest worries lay not in the United States but at home.
 The Chinese government is imposing stricter labor laws and tighter environmental regulations while cracking down on corporate tax evasion and making it harder for companies to claim large rebates of the value added taxes that they pay. 
 Chinese officials have imposed export quotas on the number of garments shipped, forcing companies to make fewer but costlier products that compete with clothing from higher wage countries. ''They really have stepped up their efforts,'' Mr. Fung of Top Form said, ''to attain what they want to see.''

STIMULUS AGREEMENT House leaders and the Bush administration, hoping to give a quick adrenaline shot to the ailing economy, struck a deal for a $150 billion stimulus package, including rebates for most tax filers of up to $600 for individuals, $1,200 for couples and, for families, an additional $300 a child.

HEADLINE: Russia Talks Of a Stability Beyond Ties To the U.S.

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER

DATELINE: MOSCOW 

 BODY:
In almost a decade since the Russian debt crisis of 1998, finance officials here have amassed an enviable war chest with the largest per capita currency reserves in the world while paying down nearly all sovereign debt. 
 They are now describing Russia as the most insulated from the ill effects of a United States recession among the chief emerging-market economies, an extraordinary role for a country on its knees not so long ago. 
 Russia will be an ''island of stability,'' Finance Minister Aleksei L. Kudrin boasted this week at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. 
 Foreign currency reserves of $478 billion, derived from windfall oil profits, are now the largest in the world per capita among big economies and will ''play the role of an air bag'' for the country, Mr. Kudrin said, as quoted by the Russian Information Agency. ''Russia will soon be the focus of attention as a haven of stability.'' 
 Some large banks are agreeing, though cautiously, that Russia seems to be the strongest of the so-called BRIC leading emerging-market countries, a group that also includes China, India and Brazil. Russia stands out as potentially least susceptible to an American recession based on trade, reliance on international capital markets and the degree to which growth is driven by exports. 
 ''Russia is probably more insulated than other BRIC emerging-growth economies,'' said John A. Thain, the new chief executive of Merrill Lynch, who was visiting Moscow on Wednesday. 
 Mr. Thain added the caveat that ''the world is a very interconnected place, and we saw all the world's equity markets react negatively.'' 
 To be sure, a steep downturn in crude oil prices below a now improbable $50 a barrel would flatten Russia's growth, according to Julia Tsepliaeva, Merrill's chief economist for the republics of the former Soviet Union. (Oil settled in New York on Thursday at $89.41, up $2.42.) 
 Russian officials and Moscow-based equity analysts have been strong proponents of the idea known as decoupling, which holds that some developing nations are strong enough and self-sufficient in the face of the declining dollar and waning American influence to part ways with Washington economically, amid a reordering of global finance. 
 The theory was debunked somewhat by the worldwide stock sell-off this week, including the downturn on the Russian Trading System stock exchange, which was off 20 percent from a high on Dec. 12 before rebounding 4.8 percent on Thursday. In its gyrations, it has largely mirrored big European and Asian exchanges. 
 Yet other evidence is emerging that at least some investors are differentiating between emerging markets based on their degree of vulnerability to an American recession and are opting for Russia. 
 Last Friday, a day when investors pulled $4 billion out of emerging markets in general, Russian-dedicated funds had a modest inflow of $30.7 million, according to EPFR Global, a company based in Cambridge, Mass., that monitors global fund flows. Russian funds have recorded inflows for 19 consecutive weeks in the face of worsening United States economic news. 
 ''It has been suggested by a number of strategists that Russia is among the more attractive among emerging markets,'' Brad Durham, managing director of EPFR, said in a telephone interview. ''It is one of the least correlated to the United States economy.''
 This results in part from Russia's minuscule trading relationship with the United States and the sour political relations between the countries over NATO expansion, missile defense and energy policy, among other issues. 
 Russia's exports to the United States account for only 3 percent of its total, compared with 16 percent to Brazil, 19 percent to India and 21 percent to China, Mr. Durham said. Its largest trading partner is Germany, a leading customer for Russian natural gas. 
 In the long term, this will work to Russia's disadvantage by isolating the country from the benefits of exposure to the world's largest economy, said Yaroslav Lissovolik, chief economist at Deutsche Bank here. In the short term, it will cushion the country from an American downturn, he said.

HEADLINE: Stimulus Gone Bad

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
House Democrats and the White House have reached an agreement on an economic stimulus plan. Unfortunately, the plan -- which essentially consists of nothing but tax cuts and gives most of those tax cuts to people in fairly good financial shape -- looks like a lemon.
 Specifically, the Democrats appear to have buckled in the face of the Bush administration's ideological rigidity, dropping demands for provisions that would have helped those most in need. And those happen to be the same provisions that might actually have made the stimulus plan effective. 
 Those are harsh words, so let me explain what's going on.
 Aside from business tax breaks -- which are an unhappy story for another column -- the plan gives each worker making less than $75,000 a $300 check, plus additional amounts to people who make enough to pay substantial sums in income tax. This ensures that the bulk of the money would go to people who are doing O.K. financially -- which misses the whole point.
 The goal of a stimulus plan should be to support overall spending, so as to avert or limit the depth of a recession. If the money the government lays out doesn't get spent -- if it just gets added to people's bank accounts or used to pay off debts -- the plan will have failed.
 And sending checks to people in good financial shape does little or nothing to increase overall spending. People who have good incomes, good credit and secure employment make spending decisions based on their long-term earning power rather than the size of their latest paycheck. Give such people a few hundred extra dollars, and they'll just put it in the bank. 
 In fact, that appears to be what mainly happened to the tax rebates affluent Americans received during the last recession in 2001.
 On the other hand, money delivered to people who aren't in good financial shape -- who are short on cash and living check to check -- does double duty: it alleviates hardship and also pumps up consumer spending.
 That's why many of the stimulus proposals we were hearing just a few days ago focused in the first place on expanding programs that specifically help people who have fallen on hard times, especially unemployment insurance and food stamps. And these were the stimulus ideas that received the highest grades in a recent analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. 
 There was also some talk among Democrats about providing temporary aid to state and local governments, whose finances are being pummeled by the weakening economy. Like help for the unemployed, this would have done double duty, averting hardship and heading off spending cuts that could worsen the downturn.
 But the Bush administration has apparently succeeded in killing all of these ideas, in favor of a plan that mainly gives money to those least likely to spend it.
 Why would the administration want to do this? It has nothing to do with economic efficacy: no economic theory or evidence I know of says that upper-middle-class families are more likely to spend rebate checks than the poor and unemployed. Instead, what seems to be happening is that the Bush administration refuses to sign on to anything that it can't call a ''tax cut.'' 
 Behind that refusal, in turn, lies the administration's commitment to slashing tax rates on the affluent while blocking aid for families in trouble -- a commitment that requires maintaining the pretense that government spending is always bad. And the result is a plan that not only fails to deliver help where it's most needed, but is likely to fail as an economic measure.
 The words of Franklin Delano Roosevelt come to mind: ''We have always known that heedless self-interest was bad morals; we know now that it is bad economics.''
 And the worst of it is that the Democrats, who should have been in a strong position -- does this administration have any credibility left on economic policy? -- appear to have caved in almost completely.
 Yes, they extracted some concessions, increasing rebates for people with low income while reducing giveaways to the affluent. But basically they allowed themselves to be bullied into doing things the Bush administration's way.
 And that could turn out to be a very bad thing. 
 We don't know for sure how deep the coming slump will be, or even whether it will meet the technical definition of a recession. But there's a real chance not just that it will be a major downturn, but that the usual response to recession -- interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve -- won't be sufficient to turn the economy around. (For more on this, see my blog at krugman.blogs.nytimes.com.)
 And if that happens, we'll deeply regret the fact that the Bush administration insisted on, and Democrats accepted, a so-called stimulus plan that just won't do the job.

HEADLINE: Tens of Thousands More From Gaza Enter Egypt Seeking Consumer Goods

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER; Mona el-Naggar contributed reporting from Cairo.

DATELINE: RAFAH, Egypt 

 BODY:
Tens of thousands more Palestinians flooded across the breached border crossing from Gaza into Egypt on Thursday, and Egyptian merchants greeted them with a cornucopia of consumer goods and higher prices than on Wednesday, when Hamas militants toppled large sections of the fence.
 Many more Egyptian police officers were at various ruptures in the barrier at Rafah, more of them in riot gear and some using batons with small electric charges to keep the huge, pushing crowds in some form of order. 
 And on Thursday, more members of Hamas security forces were visible on the Gaza side, maintaining calm and doing random checks for weapons possibly being smuggled in for Fatah, the rival faction Hamas forced out of Gaza in June.
 But neither group tried to stop the shoppers and businessmen restocking their wares in Egypt, nor did Hamas make any visible effort to control or tax the thousands of cigarettes coming into Gaza, let alone the televisions, generators, washing machines, milk, cheese, sheep, goats, cows, camels, diesel fuel and gasoline. 
 Hamas gunmen could be seen quietly taking delivery of hundreds of bags of cement. Israel has sharply restricted cement imports to Gaza, even for aid projects, because it says Hamas diverts the supply to build fortified tunnels and emplacements for use against any major Israeli military action.
 Exchange rates and prices were up, as were the amounts Gazans were buying, with the clear intent to resell in Gaza. So intense was the trading that even some Palestinians worried that there would be a backlash from impoverished Egyptians in Rafah.
 ''This is not so good for the Palestinian people,'' said Ahmed Shawa, a Gaza engineer who entered Egypt on Thursday. ''Prices are becoming very high while people in Egyptian Rafah don't have bread. If I go to your country and buy everything and you don't have bread, you're going to hate me.'' 
 Hamas officials said they took action to open the Egyptian border after Israel decided last week to stop nearly all shipments into Gaza, including industrial diesel fuel needed to run Gaza's main power plant and gasoline, in an effort to push Gazan militants to stop firing rockets at Israeli towns and farms. 
 Under severe international criticism, Israel relented, but only temporarily. It agreed to supply a week's worth of fuel, but limited supplies again after the border breach.
 President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt considered his options. But Egyptian officials made it clear on Thursday that while Egypt would not hinder Palestinians seeking food and other goods, it would not accept a lawless border, open to arms traffic and unregulated travel of gunmen and political extremists.
 Israel and the United States said it was Egypt's responsibility to bring the border situation under control.
 Gen. Ahmed Abdel Hamid, the governor of northern Sinai, estimated that as many as 120,000 Palestinians were in Egypt, but he said they were not being allowed to travel beyond El Arish, which lies slightly west of Rafah. He said he thought the border might stay open for another ''four or five days'' and then be closed pending another agreement on what to do.
 ''You have to see where this problem came from,'' he said. ''Before the dispute between Hamas and Fatah, the border was open every day with no problem. Since the dispute, the border has been closed.''
 In fact, before the fighting between the Palestinian factions over the summer the Rafah crossing was closed more often than it was open. But General Abdel Hamid emphasized that Egypt was not favoring one faction or another, saying, ''Egypt is with the legitimate authority,'' presumably the Palestinian Authority and its president, Mahmoud Abbas of Fatah.
 Mr. Mubarak's officials said Egypt would not accept responsibility for supplying Gaza and let Israel off the hook, as some Israeli officials hope.
 ''This is a wrong assumption,'' said Hossam Zaki, the spokesman for Egypt's Foreign Ministry. ''The current situation is only an exception and for temporary reasons. The border will go back to normal.''
 But the definition of normal was left unclear. When Israel pulled its settlers and troops out of Gaza in 2005, the Rafah crossing was opened with great fanfare to allow people in and out of Gaza. European Union supervisors were put in place, and Israeli video cameras monitored the traffic. But for security reasons, the crossing was often closed, and it has been shut completely since Hamas took over Gaza.
 It will be difficult politically now for Mr. Mubarak to reseal the border completely, shutting off any outlet for Gaza. Egypt, with a strong opposition element from the Muslim Brotherhood, does not want to offend its Palestinian wing, Hamas. But Mr. Mubarak would prefer to work out an arrangement with the legal authority, President Abbas. In addition, Mr. Mubarak has promised Israel that Egypt will coordinate its actions on the Gaza border to preserve security interests of both countries.
 In a speech on Thursday, Mr. Mubarak said that ''peace efforts cannot endure any other failure, and Egypt will not allow the starving of Palestinians in Gaza or that the situation in the strip turns into a humanitarian crisis.'' 
 He called on Palestinian factions to work together and said, ''No one can outbid Egypt in its support for this silent nation and their just cause.'' 
 Egypt, he said, ''is doing its utmost in its movements and contacts to end their suffering and to lift the Israeli measures of collective punishment and to bring back the supply of fuel and electricity and humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip.''
 Hamas officials want to regulate the border but reopen the crossing in coordination with Egypt. They also want to allow the import and export of goods. A Hamas leader, Mahmoud Zahar, said in an interview that Hamas wanted to end the system under which Israel collects import duties and taxes for the Palestinians. Israel does not give those receipts to Hamas, but only to the Palestinian Authority government, based in Ramallah, in the West Bank.
 He also said the Israeli economy was too expensive for Gazans, while prices of everything, including electricity, flour and gasoline, were much cheaper in Egypt.
 On Thursday, the Israeli deputy defense minister, Matan Vilnai, said openly what some senior Israeli officials would only say anonymously on Wednesday -- that Israel would like to hand over responsibility for Gaza to Egypt, in essence supporting the Hamas position. ''We need to understand that when Gaza is open to the other side we lose responsibility for it,'' Mr. Vilnai said. ''So we want to disconnect from it.''
 He said Israel's effort to disengage from Gaza ''continues in that we want to stop supplying electricity to them, stop supplying them with water and medicine, so that it would come from another place.'' But according to his office, he acknowledged that ''we are responsible for it as long as there is no alternative.''
 Mr. Abbas wants to ensure that Gaza is not permanently separated politically and economically from the West Bank, while even Hamas argues that Israel continues to be responsible for the well-being of Gazans because it continues to control Gaza's sea and airspace and the only goods crossings.
 On Sunday, Israel's Supreme Court will hear an emergency appeal by Israeli human rights groups for an injunction against Israel's cuts in electricity and in fuel supplies to Gaza. 
 Although Israel promised to deliver 580,000 gallons of industrial diesel fuel this week for Gaza's sole power plant, which supplies much of Gaza City, only 333,000 gallons had been delivered by Thursday. The power plant, which had shut down for lack of fuel and is running only one turbine, will have to shut down again on Sunday unless new supplies are delivered. Normally, Israel and Egypt supply the rest of Gaza's power needs. 
 U.N. Tells Israel to Lift Blockade
 GENEVA -- A special session of the United Nations Human Rights Council demanded Thursday that Israel lift its blockade of Gaza and condemned its ''grave'' human rights violations. 
 The resolution, sponsored by Syria on behalf of Arab states, made no reference to Palestinian rocket attacks against Israel. As a result, the council's proceedings drew criticism for anti-Israeli bias, and 15 of its 47 members abstained. 
 Human rights groups also criticized the council for devoting four of the six special sessions it had convened in the two years of its existence to the Arab-Israeli conflict, while not taking up gross violations of human rights in Sudan, Somalia, Sri Lanka and other places.

HEADLINE: At Davos, Foreign Funds Add Tension To the Talks

BYLINE: By CARTER DOUGHERTY and KATRIN BENNHOLD

DATELINE: DAVOS, Switzerland 

 BODY:
Huge pools of state-controlled cash have rescued American and European banks from their own mistakes in recent months. And the people who run those funds want some respect.
 The behavior of such sovereign wealth funds, a fringe issue last year at the World Economic Forum, has become a prime topic. Many participants are speculating on the extent to which the funds are seizing control of strategic assets or using investments to cloak a political agenda.
 Bader Al-Saad, managing director of the Kuwait Investment Authority, grew increasingly testy during a panel discussion at suggestions that his nation's fund wanted to do anything other than earn a good return. 
 ''It's all about 'if' and 'suppose,' '' Mr. Saad said. His fund helped recapitalize the banking giants Citigroup and Merrill Lynch this month after heavy losses linked to financial market turbulence. ''It's as though sovereign wealth funds are guilty before proven innocent.'' 
 Western officials, thankful for the cash in times of crisis, say they want to encourage the free flow of investment. But they are worried that, as skepticism about the benefits of globalization rises in Europe and the United States, investments from funds controlled by Russia, China and Middle East nations will ignite irresistible political demands for restrictions on investment.
 That has created a palpable tension, as Western leaders try to pre-empt a crisis that has not yet come -- and may never arrive -- by demanding that the funds be more open about their investments. 
 Western officials have cited Norway's $380 billion fund, called the Government Pension Fund-Global, as a model for the rest of the world. The fund publishes detailed statistics on its holdings and insulates itself from politics by using asset management firms to make investments. It cannot own more than a 5 percent stake in a company, and the average stake is 0.5 percent.
 But Kristin Halvorsen, Norway's finance minister, questioned whether China, Russia or even Kuwait could suddenly adopt Norwegian openness.
 ''Our transparency is very connected to the transparency of Norwegian society,'' Ms. Halvorsen said. ''It is a part of our tradition that other countries do not have.''
 Mere talk of new rules clearly grates on Russian officials.
 Alexei L. Kudrin, Russia's deputy prime minister and finance minister, who was also in Davos, pointedly reminded the audience that his country, during an extended bout of weakness in the 1990s, had no choice but to welcome Western investment.
 ''When there was a period when traditional economies had strong funds, and though several funds moved into markets and bought industries, we did not speak of restricting capital,'' Mr. Kudrin said.
 The investor George Soros pointed out that the funds, which now have $2.5 trillion to $3 trillion in assets, were diverse, and that generalized sets of rules would be hard to formulate and apply.
 ''I think we have to distinguish between different kinds of wealth funds,'' Mr. Soros said. ''Gulf states are one kind. China is another. Singapore is yet another. Russia is also different. So I don't think you can make any general rules.''
 Indeed, the funds operate in very different contexts.
 Singapore's funds, the Government Investment Corporation and Temasek Holdings, plow government savings into investments with a long track record, since the 1970s, of serving the twin goals of diversification and return maximization.
 Funds based in the Persian Gulf operate in a volatile region where the United States is a strategic power.
 China's new China Investment Corporation has raised concerns in part because Chinese companies are believed to be eager for access to Western technology. And Gazprom, the Russian state-owned natural gas giant, has flexed its muscle to such a degree -- notably in a dispute over supplies to Ukraine -- that Europeans are worried that the Russian sovereign fund, not yet operational, will operate in the same way.
 The example of DP World in Dubai, which is not a sovereign fund but a state-owned company, has lingered in the minds of people like Mr. Saad, the Kuwaiti fund manager.
 After DP World was blocked from taking over management of American ports in 2006, much of the world asked whether there was a new litmus test for investment in the United States.
 Mr. Saad insisted that any new rules should also apply to large private investors, like hedge funds. Western nations in general, he said, should become more transparent about what they define as strategic or critical sectors, areas where American and European officials say they need to preserve the right to block capital flows.

HEADLINE: Chronicle's Editor to Take Broader Role At Hearst

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
After almost eight years as the top editor, Phil Bronstein will leave The San Francisco Chronicle and take a post with its parent, the Hearst Corporation, the company announced Wednesday. 
 Mr. Bronstein, 57, has been editor of The Chronicle since 2000, when it was bought by Hearst, and before that he was editor of The San Francisco Examiner for nine years. He survived a turbulent period of changing ownership, declining circulation, strikes, recessions and, most recently, a sharp reduction in his newsroom staff.
 Hearst officials say that The Chronicle loses more than $1 million a week.
 ''The kinds of crisis that have gone on here nonstop in that time eventually cause you to turn around and say, 'What else do I want to be doing?' '' Mr. Bronstein said Thursday in an interview.
 He will become editor at large for Hearst's newspaper division, working on projects like investigations and the expansion of Web sites.
 When it bought The Chronicle for $660 million in 2000, Hearst owned The Examiner and moved most of that paper's news staff to The Chronicle. It simultaneously turned The Examiner over to new owners, supplying them with $66 million in subsidies.
 Then recession struck, and readers and advertisers shifted to the Internet. The Chronicle, like most newspapers, has struggled ever since: its weekday circulation fell to 365,000 last year from 513,000 in 2003, a decline of nearly 30 percent.
 A highlight of recent years was the paper's groundbreaking investigation into the illegal steroid business, but it also cut back sharply on coverage of national and foreign news. Last year it eliminated a quarter of its newsroom jobs, to fewer than 300 from almost 400, and many high-ranking editors were among those who left or were forced out.
 Mr. Bronstein ''did a pretty good job of merging the two staffs, trying to keep up morale,'' said Carl T. Hall, an organizer for the Northern California Media Workers Guild who is on leave from his job as a Chronicle reporter. ''He tried to resist the worst of the budget-cutting, but eventually there was nothing he could do.''

HEADLINE: Health Care Up to Public, Edwards Says

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK

DATELINE: PATRICK, S.C. 

 BODY:
Former Senator John Edwards does not discount the possibility that his health care proposal, which would allow Americans to buy new government insurance packages modeled on Medicare, could evolve into a federalized system like those in Canada and many European countries. And if it does, Mr. Edwards said he would be just fine with that.
 But Mr. Edwards, of North Carolina, emphasized in a 40-minute interview on health policy that the choice would be made not in Washington, but by consumers in an open marketplace where private insurance competes with government plans. 
 ''American health consumers will decide which works best,'' Mr. Edwards said Wednesday afternoon while traveling through South Carolina on his campaign bus. ''It could continue to be divided. But it could go in one direction or the other, and one of the directions is obviously government or single-payer. And I'm not opposed to that.'' 
 Each of the three Democratic front-runners has called for government insurance that would be available to an expanded number of consumers, not just the elderly and disabled as is currently the case with Medicare. If the government is able to undercut private insurers on price -- by forgoing profit, reducing overhead, and maximizing economies of scale -- it theoretically could put the private system out of business and become the de facto insurer for the nation.
 Republican candidates and policy strategists have raised the specter of ''socialized medicine'' and depicted the Democratic plans as a back-door route to a so-called single-payer government system. 
 Mr. Edwards brushed off that critique. ''There is nothing back-door about it,'' he said. ''It's right through the front door. We're going to let America decide what health care system works for them.''
 Karen Davis, president of the Commonwealth Fund, a foundation based in New York that researches health policy, said most countries with single-payer systems adopted them before private insurance took hold, and that none evolved through the marketplace. She agreed, however, that a Medicare-style plan would compete ferociously with private plans on price.
 Though he was the Democratic vice-presidential nominee in the presidential campaign of Senator John Kerry in 2004, Mr. Edwards has yet to win a primary or caucus, and is polling third before Saturday's Democratic primary here in his birth state. Regardless of his prospects, he argues that his populist campaign has driven his party's debate on health care by being the first to produce a comprehensive plan intended to cover all 47 million uninsured. 
 That, he maintained, had forced Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama to follow with their own detailed proposals. ''It makes it very difficult for other candidates to float through on rhetoric,'' he said.
 Mr. Edwards spoke comfortably about both the philosophical underpinnings and policy details of the health coverage debate. Whether or not he can claim credit for leading the discussion, a virtual Democratic consensus has formed around the major elements he has proposed, and around the notion that government, businesses and individuals should share the financial burden.
 Republican proposals for expanded access have focused on tax credits to help consumers better afford insurance premiums. 
 Mr. Edwards did not propose a universal coverage plan when he ran for president in 2004, focusing instead on expanding enrollment of children. But a day after the Kerry-Edwards ticket lost, his wife, Elizabeth, was found to have breast cancer, and his family began its first-hand education in the vagaries of the system. 
 ''I mean, when you get the statements by the providers and the insurance companies about what's covered and what's not covered, even for two people who are well versed in the law and experienced with the health care system, it seems completely arbitrary in many cases,'' said Mr. Edwards, a lawyer. ''It doesn't make any sense.'' 
 The public nature of Mrs. Edwards's illness -- she announced a recurrence at a news conference last year -- drew people with health care horror stories to the Edwards campaign. As health care costs and the number of uninsured continued to rise, Mr. Edwards sensed that people were ready for more radical surgery on the insurance system.
 ''I concluded that something bolder was needed, that the health care system had become increasingly dysfunctional,'' he said. ''And my contact with a lot of uninsured Americans, who were not children, made it clear to me that the plan had to be universal, that it had to cover everybody.''
 For advocates of universal health care, the threshold question is whether the existing public-private system can be revamped to make insurance affordable for all, or whether that can be achieved only through a government takeover.
 Mr. Edwards said he strongly considered a single-payer plan before announcing his initiative last February. 
 ''I thought that there was a legitimate and strong argument for it,'' he said. ''But I also believed that there are an awful lot of Americans who like the health care they have and are nervous about entirely government-controlled health care.''
 Under Mr. Edwards's proposal, which resembles the plan adopted in Massachusetts in 2006, the government would require individuals to have insurance (illegal immigrants excepted). It also would prohibit insurance companies from rejecting high-risk applicants and would restrict their profits and overhead to 15 percent of revenue from premiums.
 Government subsidies and tax credits would be available to low- and middle-income families that cannot afford insurance. Those below the federal poverty line -- currently $21,200 for a family of four -- would get free coverage, Mr. Edwards said. Those making less than 250 percent of the poverty level -- currently $53,000 -- would be heavily subsidized and there would be some financial help for those making up to about $100,000.
 Employers that do not offer medical benefits to their workers would have to contribute 6 percent of their revenues to the regional government pools that would offer Medicare-style plans. Midsize businesses and employers with large numbers of low-wage workers might be asked to pay less, and the smallest businesses would be exempt, Edwards aides said.
 To pay for those subsidies, which account for much of the estimated $90 billion to $120 billion cost of the plan, Mr. Edwards would rescind President Bush's income tax cuts for those with incomes above $200,000. Additional revenue would be produced through a broad menu of cost-control measures. 
 Like his opponents, Mr. Edwards would promote preventive medicine and chronic-disease management and require doctors and hospitals to convert to electronic record-keeping.
 Mr. Edwards has joined with Mrs. Clinton in arguing that Mr. Obama's plan would not provide universal coverage because it mandates insurance only for children, as Mr. Edwards did in 2004. 
 But Mr. Edwards's own mandate would not take effect until insurance is considered affordable. He could not define how or when that might be determined. Thus far, that has been a critical shortcoming of the plan in Massachusetts, where thousands of residents may be exempted from the insurance requirement because they cannot afford even subsidized premiums. 
 Mr. Edwards has not proposed such exemptions. He said that those who do not have insurance would be required to obtain it whenever they come into contact with a health care provider or government services office.

HEADLINE: Bush and House in Accord For $150 Billion Stimulus

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN; Edmund L. Andrews, Carl Hulse, Steven Lee Myers and Robert Pear contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Hoping to give a quick adrenaline shot to the ailing economy, President Bush and House leaders struck a deal on Thursday for a $150 billion fiscal stimulus package, including rebates for most tax filers of up to $600 for individuals, $1,200 for couples and, for families, an additional $300 a child. 
 The deal capped a series of fast-paced and intense negotiations in which the Bush administration and lawmakers in both parties had to agree to numerous compromises after more than a year of acid relations between Congressional Democrats and the White House. 
 In praising the deal, Mr. Bush said it had resulted from ''the kind of cooperation that some predicted was not possible here in Washington.'' 
 The House is expected to approve the package on Feb. 6, and the leaders in both chambers have set a goal of Feb. 15 to send a measure for the president's signature, a deadline Senate Democrats said they could meet even though they had reservations about the plan. 
 Although the two sides made big concessions, the deal came together because each side could walk away claiming victory. 
 The White House made clear early that it would not insist on permanently extending the president's tax cuts from 2001 and 2003. Many Democrats had seen such a demand as a potential deal breaker. 
 And Speaker Nancy Pelosi ultimately bowed to Mr. Bush's insistence that the package not include extending unemployment benefits or increasing food stamps.
 And by the time Ms. Pelosi, Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. and the House Republican leader, Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, formally announced the deal at a brief news conference at the Capitol, the two sides were crowing that they had achieved something remarkable, even as some economists questioned whether the package could be adopted and put into effect quickly enough to have a real effect. 
 Republicans expressed satisfaction that they had forced House Democrats to show fiscal restraint, by agreeing to a plan focused mostly on tax cuts.
 ''I have always believed that allowing people to keep more of their own money and use it as they see fit is the best way to help our economy grow,'' Mr. Bush said. ''I'm also pleased that this agreement does not include any tax increases, as well as unnecessary spending projects.''
 House Democrats , in turn, said they were pleased that they had persuaded the White House to endorse a package primarily benefiting middle- and working-class Americans by setting income caps on the full rebates at $75,000 for individuals and $150,000 for joint filers. 
 Democrats said that would be the reverse of Mr. Bush's earlier tax policies, which primarily benefited wealthier filers.
 ''It's the mirror opposite,'' said Representative Rahm Emanuel of Illinois, the Democratic conference chairman. ''This is middle class and progressive.'' 
 Senate Democrats, however, immediately criticized the plan, which also provides tax breaks for businesses, and said they were developing their own package that could temporarily extend unemployment benefits and increase food stamps.
 Some economists agree with Senate Democrats that increasing the benefits and food stamps would inject money into the economy faster than the rebate checks, which would not be sent until May at the earliest. 
 House Democrats countered that their package would send more money to low-income workers than an increase in food stamps, and they pointed to a projection that 35 million families would receive one-time payments of $300, even though they did not earn enough money to pay income taxes. Under the deal, tax filers who earned at least $3,000 last year, but paid less than $300 in income tax, would receive the $300. 
 The majority leader, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, who had said the House should lead in negotiating the package with the White House, was one of several Democrats calling the House plan ''a first step,'' but saying the Senate expected to shape the final result. 
 ''The secretary of the Treasury has understood, the president has understood, the speaker has understood that when it comes over here, we are going to take another look at it,'' Mr. Reid said.
 Among the components the Senate might seek to add, he said, was a summer jobs program for young people at a cost of $500 million to $1 billion. Some Democrats said they would push for more public works spending, which is often given low marks as a tool because projects take too long to start. 
 Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, said road resurfacing in particular could be done fast. ''I am absolutely convinced that there are infrastructure projects that can get off the ground weeks and weeks earlier than the rebate checks end up in people's hands,'' Mr. Wyden said. 
 Mr. Paulson, standing with the president, acknowledged hurdles remained on Capitol Hill. ''The work is far from over,'' he said. 
 The plan's cost will add to a 2008 budget deficit projected at $219 billion. Over 10 years, House officials said, the plan would add $110 billion to the national debt.
 If enacted, the rebates and stipends in the House package, totaling $103 billion, are expected to reach 117 million taxpayers. Payments will be processed automatically for all tax filers. 
 Full rebates of up to $600 or $1,200 would be paid to individuals earning up to $75,000 adjusted gross income or couples filing jointly and earning up to $150,000. Above that, rebates would be reduced by 5 percent for each $1,000 in income. Rebates would be reduced by $50 for each $1,000 in income, meaning a couple with no children earning $174,000 would have no rebate. A single mother of two children earning $50,000 and paying at least $600 in taxes would receive $1,200 --a $600 individual rebate and $300 a child. A married couple with three children earning $100,000 and paying at least $1,200 in taxes would receive $2,100 -- a $1,200 rebate and $300 a child. 
 On the business side, companies would be given a 50 percent bonus deduction on new equipment that would normally be depreciated over many years. The incentive, which would cost $42.3 billion in 2008, is intended to encourage spending. The package would also double the limit on expenses, to $250,000 from $125,000, that small business can write off as a deduction from annual income, with a total cap of $800,000. That is expected to cost $1 billion in 2008. 
 In a nod to the mortgage market problems, the plan would allow Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored mortgage-finance companies, to buy loans up to $625,500, from the current $417,000 limit. The Federal Housing Administration would be able to insure home loans of up to $725,000, from the current $362,000 ceiling. 
 The one-year increases would make it easier to obtain new mortgages or refinance loans in expensive markets. 
 In a major concession, the White House agreed to increase the conforming loan limits and stopped insisting on wider reform of the mortgage finance companies. Mr. Paulson, at a news conference, acknowledged that he was not happy about that. 
 ''I got run down by a bipartisan steamroller,'' he said. ''Republicans and Democrats reunited on this.''
 The cooperation was accelerated by worsening economic news. Mr. Bush had initially intended to wait until his State of the Union speech on Jan. 28 to decide whether a stimulus was needed, but gloomier economic indicators forced him to speed those plans. 
 He moved swiftly after returning from the Middle East to speak to Congressional leaders and start negotiations. Finally, the declines in global stock markets on Monday and the emergency rate cut by the Federal Reserve on Tuesday pushed the House leaders and the Treasury secretary into high gear. 
 The House took the lead in part to avoid entangling the stimulus negotiations in presidential politics -- two leading Democratic candidates and a leading Republican one are senators -- and in part because the Democratic majority is wider and the caucus easier to unify in the House than in the Senate. 
 The final meeting among Ms. Pelosi, Mr. Paulson and Mr. Boehner was a Wednesday evening session that lasted from just after 7 until about 8:30. 
 Ms. Pelosi returned to her office where she met late into the night with Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. Mr. Rangel had lobbied strenuously to include payments for the poorest wage earners, even if they do not have to pay income taxes, and to extend unemployment benefits. 
 The deal was sealed in phone calls on Thursday morning, less than a week after Mr. Bush had a conference call with Congressional leaders. 
 Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said his panel would mark up its package on Tuesday. 
 At a Senate hearing on Thursday, Peter R. Orszag, director of the Congressional Budget Office, testified that increases in food stamps and unemployment benefits would have more immediate economic effects than rebates.
 ''Food stamp and unemployment benefits can affect spending in two months,'' Mr. Orszag said. ''Rebates would affect spending at the end of 2008.''

HEADLINE: U.S. ASKING IRAQ FOR WIDE RIGHTS IN FIGHTING WAR

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER and STEVEN LEE MYERS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
With its international mandate in Iraq set to expire in 11 months, the Bush administration will insist that the government in Baghdad give the United States broad authority to conduct combat operations and guarantee civilian contractors specific legal protections from Iraqi law, according to administration and military officials.
 This emerging American negotiating position faces a potential buzz saw of opposition from Iraq, with its fragmented Parliament, weak central government and deep sensitivities about being seen as a dependent state, according to these officials. 
 At the same time, the administration faces opposition from Democrats at home, who warn that the agreements that the White House seeks would bind the next president by locking in Mr. Bush's policies and a long-term military presence.
 The American negotiating position for a formal military-to-military relationship, one that would replace the current United Nations mandate, is laid out in a draft proposal that was described by White House, Pentagon, State Department and military officials on ground rules of anonymity. It also includes less controversial demands that American troops be immune from Iraqi prosecution, and that they maintain the power to detain Iraqi prisoners. 
 However, the American quest for protections for civilian contractors is expected to be particularly vexing, because in no other country are contractors working with the American military granted protection from local laws. Some American officials want contractors to have full immunity from Iraqi law, while others envision less sweeping protections. These officials said the negotiations with the Iraqis, expected to begin next month, would also determine whether the American authority to conduct combat operations in the future would be unilateral, as it is now, or whether it would require consultation with the Iraqis or even Iraqi approval. 
 ''These are going to be tough negotiations,'' said one senior Bush administration official preparing for negotiations with the Iraqis. ''They're not supplicants.''
 Democrats in Congress, as well as the party's two leading presidential contenders, Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama, have accused the White House of sponsoring negotiations that will set into law a long-term security relationship with Iraq. 
 But administration officials said that the American proposal specifically did not set future troop levels in Iraq or ask for permanent American bases there. Nor, they said, did it offer a security guarantee defining Washington's specific responsibilities should Iraq come under attack.
 Including such long-term commitments in the agreement would turn the accord into a bilateral treaty, one that would require Senate approval. The Bush administration faces the political reality that it cannot count on the two-thirds vote that would be required to approve a treaty with Iraq setting out such a military commitment.
 Administration officials are describing their draft proposal in terms of a traditional status-of-forces agreement, an accord that has historically been negotiated by the executive branch and signed by the executive branch without a Senate vote. 
 ''I think it's pretty clear that such an agreement would not talk about force levels,'' Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Thursday. ''We have no interest in permanent bases. I think the way to think about the framework agreement is an approach to normalizing the relationship between the United States and Iraq.''
 While the United States currently has military agreements with more than 80 countries around the world, including Japan, Germany, South Korea and a number of Iraq's neighbors, none of those countries are at war. And none has a population outraged over civilian deaths at the hands of armed American security contractors who are not answerable to Iraqi law.
 Democratic critics have complained that the initial announcement about the administration's intention to negotiate an agreement, made Nov. 26, included an American pledge to support Iraq ''in defending its democratic system against internal and external threats.''
 Representative Bill Delahunt, Democrat of Massachusetts, said that what the administration was negotiating amounted to a treaty and should be subjected to Congressional oversight and ultimately ratification.
 ''Where have we ever had an agreement to defend a foreign country from external attack and internal attack that was not a treaty?'' he said Wednesday at a hearing of a foreign affairs subcommittee held to review the matter. ''This could very well implicate our military forces in a full-blown civil war in Iraq. If a commitment of this magnitude does not rise to the level of a treaty, then it is difficult to imagine what could.'' 
 Senator Jim Webb, Democrat of Virginia, who raised concerns in a letter to the White House in December, said the negotiations were an unprecedented step toward making an agreement on status of forces without the overarching security guarantees like those provided in the NATO treaty. He added that the Democratic majority would seek to block any agreements with the Iraqis, unless the administration was clear about its ultimate intentions in Iraq.
 ''There's no exit strategy, because the administration doesn't have one,'' Senator Webb said in a telephone interview on Thursday. ''By entering this agreement, they avoid a debate and they validate their unspoken strategy.''
 Over recent days, administration officials acknowledged that the language of the Nov. 26 announcement went too far. The officials said that they were limiting the scope of the pending negotiations to issues that could be resolved this year, before the Security Council resolution expired.
 To that end, administration officials said the draft text was narrowly written to codify what the administration regarded as four essential requirements for the American armed forces to continue the mission in Iraq.
 In seeking immunity for contractors, the administration is requesting protections for the 154,000 civilian contractors working for the Defense Department in Iraq; most carry out such duties as driving trucks, preparing meals and the like. The administration says it depends heavily on those contractors, including about 13,000 private security contractors working for the Pentagon. 
 Under an earlier agreement between the United States and Iraq, those contractors have been exempt from Iraqi law. Justice Department officials have said it is not clear whether any crimes committed by contractors in Iraq, including the role played by Blackwater employees in a September shooting in Baghdad, would be subject to American law, but the administration has taken steps intended to close any loopholes.
 In seeking authority to conduct combat operations, the Bush administration is seeking something similar to the current United Nations Security Council resolution, which allows the United States and other coalition forces to operate in Iraq ''in support of mutual goals,'' one Bush administration official said. 
 The official said the agreement sought by the United States could allow Iraq to ''rescind that authority at a later date as the security environment improves and they take over the mission.''
 In contrast to the contractors, the immunity being sought for American military personnel is a standard part of most recent agreements for basing American forces on foreign soil. Such agreements grant exclusive jurisdiction over American forces to American law, specifically the Uniform Code of Military Justice.
 In terms of prisoners, the administration and military would like the Iraqis eventually to take control of all battlefield detainees. But they say that the United States still needs the authority to hold those prisoners, because Baghdad does not yet have the capacity -- in personnel, facilities or legal structures -- to manage the current detainee population of about 26,000.
 Senior administration officials say concerns that the agreement will limit the decisions of the next president are not justified.
 ''More than 90 percent of this will be a pretty standard status-of-forces agreement,'' said one senior official involved in drafting the American proposal. ''It is not something that will tie the hands of the next president.''
 The military-to-military aspect of the relationship is to be negotiated by July 31, well ahead of the Dec. 31 expiration date for the United Nations Security Council Resolution that has been the core legal authority for the American-led military mission in Iraq. Diplomats will also negotiate political and economic relations between the two countries.
 The draft American text on military-to-military relations, now under discussion at the White House, Pentagon and State Department, is short, running fewer than 15 pages.
 ''It's not 'War and Peace,' and it doesn't have a lot of hard-to-read legal jargon,'' said one military officer.
 American officials are keenly aware that any agreement must be approved by Iraq's fractured Council of Representatives, where Sunni and Shiite factions feud and even Shiite blocs loyal to competing leaders cannot agree.

HEADLINE: Panel Says New Jersey Won't Save All Hospitals

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN; Elizabeth Dwoskin contributed reporting from Newark.

DATELINE: PRINCETON, N.J. 

 BODY:
New Jersey wants to get out of the business of saving every hospital from financial ruin.
 In a report made public on Thursday, a commission appointed by Gov. Jon S. Corzine recommended that the state establish guidelines for identifying hospitals in financial distress that are worth helping, and those are that are not.
 Hospitals deemed essential would then be propped by state grants and loans, with what the state health commissioner, Heather Howard, described as an early-warning system. 
 Joel C. Cantor, the director of the Center for State Health Policy at Rutgers University, who is a member of the commission, said hospital boards should think twice about what has become a habit of ''go to the governor's office and ask for help.'' 
 ''We're trying to send a signal that there's no guarantee that that help will be there,'' he said.
 The report is not as far-reaching as one ordered by the New York State Legislature in 2006, in which a commission recommended that at least nine hospitals, including five in New York City, be closed. Indeed, the New Jersey report did not spell out which hospitals should be shuttered.
 Uwe E. Reinhardt, a health care economist at Princeton and chairman of the commission, said that a specific list would probably hurt a hospital's ability to negotiate insurance rates and damage employee morale.
 But the report did not mince words, saying that a good number of New Jersey's 78 hospitals were poorly managed and inefficient, and that a ''large number of hospitals appear headed toward distress in the next few years.''
 The report now goes to Mr. Corzine, and it is not clear what he will do, and when he will do it. For now, his top priority is shepherding his multibillion-dollar plan to restructure the state's troubled finances through substantially higher toll road increases.
 What is troubling about New Jersey's hospitals, the report found, is that even though many hospitals across the country are doing well financially, those in New Jersey are not; 15 have closed in the last 10 years.
 The report concluded that too many hospitals in New Jersey are bunched in the same areas, particularly in the northeast, resulting in a surplus of beds. 
 In addition, the report found problems with public insurance like Medicaid and the state's Charity Care program, which, it said, reimburse hospitals well below cost. At the same time, the report noted, chronically ill elderly patients covered by Medicare see more doctors a year than in any other state in the nation.
 As a result, the state has frequently been asked, at the very last minute, to help rescue an endangered hospital, often at a cost much higher than if it had intervened earlier, the report said.
 If the governor follows the commission's recommendations, the system will undergo substantial changes. For instance, if the state decides to classify hospitals as essential or nonessential, they will all be defined by certain criteria, like providing care to a vulnerable population, providing an essential service like trauma care or existing in an area not saturated by hospitals.
 The cost of adopting the recommendations is not clear. Some of the measures will cost money; others will save money, Ms. Howard said. One idea, for instance, would increase the current 3 percent tax on ambulatory care and other clinics, and use the increase to finance a fund for distressed hospitals.
 In a statement, the New Jersey Hospital Association commended the commission for tackling a tough subject, but said that it did not offer sufficient solutions or address options to obtain new financing.
 ''If I had to grade the commission's work, I would give it an A for effort but an overall grade of Incomplete,'' said Gary S. Carter, the group's president and chief executive.

HEADLINE: Frailty of U.S. Finances Has Japanese Agonizing

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
As talk of an American recession has helped batter global financial markets in recent weeks, economic policy makers in Japan, the world's second-largest economy, have largely sat on the sidelines.
 Japan's government and central bank have offered little to reassure worried investors, even as waves of selling produced steep declines in stock market indexes, including Tokyo's. This was in contrast to the United States, the largest economy, where leaders are proposing a roughly $150 billion stimulus package and cutting interest rates in an effort to calm the financial turmoil.
 Japanese officials say their hands are tied by the nation's soaring budget deficit and already rock-bottom interest rates, which give policy makers little leeway to maneuver. Yet a rising number of politicians and economists here see their country as missing a chance to regain some of its lost status as a global economic leader. 
 In Parliament and the news media, a debate is growing about whether the country should do more to step into the breach caused by the slowing of the American economic engine and help to prop up global growth. 
 Some say that Japan is the best positioned in Asia to act, with a $4.7 trillion economy that remains much larger than its rivals China and India. But even proponents of a more active approach acknowledge that Japan's inability so far to help stimulate the global economy may be just one more sign that the country is not the economic powerhouse it used to be.
 As Hideo Kumano, chief economist at Dai-Ichi Life Research Institute in Tokyo, put it: ''The No. 2 global economy, Japan, should be playing a central role at a time like this. But the fact is Japan doesn't have the strength or will to do that.''
 Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda and other leaders have made it clear that they view the current crisis as American in origin, and beyond their reach. When questioned in Parliament on Tuesday about the global financial turmoil, Mr. Fukuda replied that it was ''not something that came from the actual condition of Japan's economy.'' 
 However, on Thursday, a group of lawmakers from Mr. Fukuda's Liberal Democratic Party, including former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, proposed several measures to revive Japanese stock markets, including suspending capital-gains taxes and creating a sovereign fund to invest in equities.
 Economists called the proposals too small to make a difference. They also said that Japan had few real options.
 First, the nation is already burdened with one of the world's highest levels of government debt, $7.2 trillion, making it very unlikely that lawmakers would support an expensive package of new spending or tax cuts large enough to stimulate a $4.7 trillion economy. 
 In addition, such a stimulus package would face a struggle in Parliament, which has been in virtual political deadlock since the opposition Democratic Party of Japan won control of the upper house last summer.
 Most economists say the likeliest step would be an interest rate cut by the central bank, the Bank of Japan. Many prominent politicians have urged the bank to lower the overnight lending rate back down to zero, where it was two years ago, from 0.5 percent now. A few call for more radical steps, such as intentionally creating low inflation to rekindle growth.
 ''Concerns over a recession are emerging not only in the U.S., but in Japan as well,'' Kozo Yamamoto, head of the ruling party's panel on monetary policy, told Bloomberg News on Wednesday. ''The B.O.J. should cut rates back to zero immediately,'' he said.
 But most economists say a rate cut has a 50-50 chance at best. The current bank governor, Toshihiko Fukui, has a track record of resisting rate cuts. In fact, he has repeatedly spoken in favor of a continued raising of borrowing costs to prevent a repeat of a situation in the 1980s, when cheap money helped to create disastrous price bubbles in Japan's land and stock markets. Just last week, Mr. Fukui reiterated his view that the current rate was too low. 
 A potential window for policy change appears next month, when the government is expected to name a successor to Mr. Fukui, whose five-year term ends in March. Of the two most likely candidates, one is now a deputy bank governor, Toshiro Muto, who would be expected to maintain the status quo. But the other, Kazuo Ueda, a former member of the bank's policy board, has favored rate cuts to spur growth.
 ''The only effective policy option for Japan is choosing a more aggressive governor for the B.O.J.,'' said Naoki Iizuka, a senior economist at Mizuho Securities. ''The B.O.J. is the only place where policy action could take place these days.''
 Mr. Iizuka and others say that Japan's biggest problem is a lack of strong political leadership on economic issues. They say Prime Minister Fukuda, a soft-spoken party insider, has failed to articulate a clear vision of Japan's economic direction. 
 At the same time, the government is widely thought to be hurting the economy with a series of bungled policies, including the sudden introduction of a strict new building code last summer that sent housing starts plunging 40 percent.
 ''There is no leadership, no economic focus,'' said Jesper Koll, an economist who heads the Tokyo office of a hedge fund company, Tantallon Capital Advisors. ''Then there are these screw-ups, which are a huge shot to confidence.''

The High Price of Getting In
 Receiving an invitation to the World Economic Forum is considered an honor for most -- but it does not come cheap. Representatives of governments, nonprofit organizations and the news media attend free. But corporate executives must pay for the privilege, and do so dearly.
 To be eligible for an invitation, one must pay an annual fee of 42,500 Swiss francs, or nearly $39,000. On top of that is $20,000 or so to attend the conference. (That is just the cost of admission -- private planes, limousines and fancy ski outfits are, of course, extra.) 
 The cost rises to about $412,000 (450,000 Swiss francs) to win the prestigious title of ''strategic partner.'' ANDREW ROSS SORKIN
 Market Troubles
 Keep Few Away 
 Shares plummet and American central bankers meet for an emergency rate cut? Apparently that's no reason for the world's top bankers and financial policy makers to cancel the annual schmooze-fest. Mark Adams, the forum's director of communications, said he had had 16 phone calls by 4 p.m. Tuesday. In fact, only 13 of some 2,400 guests canceled at the last minute, Mr. Adams's team had determined by 8 p.m. Tuesday, and apparently none because of the tumultuous markets. KATRIN BENNHOLD
 A Rosy Picture
 When a government official starts talking about good economic fundamentals, you know something has gone wrong.
 ''Its long-term economic fundamentals are healthy,'' Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said of the United States in a speech Wednesday.
 She spoke of idealism and optimism, not just for the American economy, but also for the Middle East, trade talks and a solution for climate change as well. 
 FLOYD NORRIS
 An Obama Fan 
 The sharpest focus of the World Economic Forum may be on the future of the beleaguered economy, but room remains for some of the world's most influential financiers to talk politics.
 At a lunch Wednesday, George Soros, the billionaire and former hedge fund manager who is a regular participant at Davos, revealed a regard for Senator Barack Obama as a Democratic candidate in the United States' presidential race. But, diplomatically, he kept the door open to Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, too. ALAN COWELL
 Pessimistic Bulls?
 Optimistic Bears?
 The title of the dinner debate was apt: ''Recession,'' in the forum's program folder in bold red letters as if to drive home the point. After a day of debates dedicated to (or inevitably turning to) the United States economy's sorry outlook, two chief executives joked that it felt like an act of masochism to end the day like this (rather than at the simultaneous wine-tasting or story-telling dinners).
 But for all those who had wondered whether the bull as a species in financial markets had died out for good, it was a welcome surprise to find a dozen of them here. KATRIN BENNHOLD Bill Gates 2.0
 In his speech to a standing-room-only crowd Thursday evening, Bill Gates of Microsoft took the first steps toward transforming himself from software baron to social philosopher.
 His new effort is based on a public challenge he issued in his address to executives, urging them to pair the self-interest that is the hallmark of capitalism with interest in the welfare of others. Mr. Gates quoted an early work of Adam Smith to buttress his claim that humans are just as interested in ensuring others' fortunes as their own.
 ''I'm an optimist, but I'm an impatient optimist,'' he said in the speech. ''The world is not getting better fast enough, and it's not getting better for everyone.'' JOHN MARKOFF
 Sovereign Funds:
 A Close-Up View
 If there were a phenomenon tailor-made for discussion at Davos, it might be the rise of sovereign wealth funds. The economic forum was founded for discussions of economics and geopolitics.
 On Thursday, there was a panel discussion on the rise of those government-run investment funds. Here's what one participant, Stephen A. Schwarzman, below, of the Blackstone Group, said: ''Our experience with sovereign wealth funds is they are smart, long term, highly professional. All they are looking for is higher rate of return.''
 (We should note that the largest shareholder in Mr. Schwarzman's buyout firm is one such fund.) PETER EDMONSTON
 Still Time to Deal
 ''A merger is like two people falling in love,'' Klaus Schwab, the founder of the economic forum, was once quoted in Wired magazine as saying. ''Sometimes we are the place where the people first meet. Sometimes we are the place where they do the proposing. And sometimes we just provide the beautiful sunset.''
 While the conference at Davos may be best known for its discussions of weighty ideas, sometimes this Swiss town is the setting for deal making. Last year, Davos was the backdrop for conversations between Barclays and ABN Amro, leading to a fevered bidding war that Barclays lost. That ill-fated pairing was hatched when Barclays's chief executive, John Varley, and ABN's chief, Rijkman Groenink, holed up in a hotel room to hash out proposed terms of a deal. ANDREW ROSS SORKIN
 The Hot Tickets
 The hot ticket at Davos remains the party given by Google. This year, the British D.J. who has been called the Minister of Sound is presiding. (But the better party is often the one by Accel Partners, the venture capital firm.) ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

HEADLINE: Obama Delivers an Anticorporate Message

BYLINE: By SARAH WHEATON

 BODY:
Senator Barack Obama, Democrat of Illinois, is running three new advertisements in six states ahead of the multistate primary on Feb. 5. This 30-second commercial, ''Need,'' is running in Connecticut, Delaware and Utah. 
 PRODUCER Obama media team
 THE SCRIPT Mr. Obama says, ''I'm Barack Obama, and I approved this message.'' Then, addressing a town-hall-style event, he says, ''This administration has further divided Wall Street from Main Street. You got C.E.O.'s who are making more in 10 minutes than ordinary workers are making in a year.'' In an interview, he continues: ''The bedrock, the foundation of our economy, is our workers. And the middle class have been treading water or worse. My plan says: 'Let's return some balance to our tax code. Close these corporate loopholes the lobbyists put in, and let's make sure that tax breaks are given to people who really need it.' ''
 ON THE SCREEN The advertisement opens with a black and white photo of Mr. Obama, then switches to video of him speaking at the forum in Oak Park, Ill. Mr. Obama then speaks to the camera, with cuts away to scenes of him meeting voters and a photo of him with someone wearing a ''Jobs! Worth fighting for'' T-shirt. Beneath is text highlighting his economic proposals, including ''Close corporate tax loopholes,'' ''$1,000 tax cut per working family'' and ''No taxes on seniors making under $50,000.'' It ends with information about how to vote in the state in which the commercial appears.
 ACCURACY The gap between executive pay and worker compensation has been on the rise, but is not as great as at its peak in 2000, said Kevin J. Murphy, a professor at the Marshall School of Business at the University of Southern California. The average top executive at a Standard & Poor's 500 company now makes 550 times what the average worker makes -- not quite the ''10 minutes'' mark, Professor Murphy said, although ''you could obviously find an example that would make that right.'' 
 SCORECARD The campaign's decision to run the anticorporate spots in Connecticut and Delaware, centers of the hedge fund and banking and credit card industries, respectively, could be seen as risky. During the first three quarters of 2007, Mr. Obama received $489,234 from employees of hedge funds, second among Democrats only to Senator Christopher J. Dodd, who is no longer seeking the nomination, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks campaign contributions. Those states do have many middle-class homeowners who could be feeling the squeeze in an economic downturn.

HEADLINE: US Airways Posts Loss After 4 Profitable Quarters

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: TEMPE, Ariz. 

 BODY:
The US Airways Group said Thursday that it had swung to a fourth-quarter loss as a result of significantly higher fuel costs.
 The loss was the first after four consecutive quarters of profit. 
 The airline's loss was $79 million, or 87 cents a share, contrasted with a profit of $12 million, or 13 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Revenue edged lower to $2.78 billion from $2.79 billion.
 Excluding special items, US Airways reported a net loss of $42 million, or 45 cents a share, for the period.
 Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial had expected a loss of 76 cents a share on revenue of $2.82 billion for the three-month period ended Dec. 31. Thomson estimates usually exclude special items.
 US Airways' costs for fuel and related taxes rose 26.9 percent, to $730 million, in the quarter. 
 The airline's shares fell 44 cents, to close at $12.70.
 The chairman and chief executive, W. Douglas Parker, said that troubles could continue in 2008.
 ''If oil prices stay where they are,'' Mr. Parker said, ''we project our fuel expenses will be about $800 million higher than they were in 2007.''
 He said a slowdown in the American economy had not affected bookings, but it ''gives us concern for our ability to pass along $800 million in higher fuel prices'' to customers. 
 High fuel costs have torn into profits across the industry. Delta Air Lines and the parent companies of United Airlines and American Airlines also posted losses for the quarter. Southwest Airlines, however, doubled its fourth-quarter profit thanks to its financial hedging against high fuel costs.
 US Airways' mainline traffic fell 3.2 percent in the quarter as it trimmed capacity 4.6 percent.

HEADLINE: At Debate on the Economy, Republicans Become Kindest of Candidates

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER and MICHAEL LUO

DATELINE: BOCA RATON, Fla. 

 BODY:
With the fiercely contested Florida primary election just days away, the Republican presidential candidates engaged in some decidedly gentle sparring here Thursday night as they all tried to cast themselves as able fiscal stewards who could steer the nation's increasingly precarious economy back to health.
 It was not exactly the kind of knock-down, drag-out fight that has characterized past Republican debates. Most of the candidates agreed that the economic stimulus plan being considered in Washington was a good first step but also said it should include permanent tax cuts.
 All but Representative Ron Paul of Texas said the war in Iraq had been a good idea, if poorly carried out at points. And when they got the chance to ask one another questions -- usually the moment to take out the cudgel -- most of them posed bland, fairly polite ones. 
 Economic issues dominated throughout the 90-minute debate. In one of the few direct engagements, Mitt Romney noted that Senator John McCain had voted against tax cuts sought by President Bush. 
 ''Senator McCain voted against them originally,'' Mr. Romney said. ''He now believes they should be made permanent. I'm glad he agrees they should be made permanent. I think he should have voted for them the first time around.'' 
 Mr. McCain responded that he had opposed a big tax cut because it was not accompanied by corresponding spending cuts.
 ''We let it get out of control,'' he said. ''And the fact is that if we had had the spending restraints that I proposed, we would be talking about more tax cuts today. We would be talking about more tax cuts.''
 Mr. McCain was one of only two Republican senators to vote against Mr. Bush's $1.35 trillion tax cut measure in 2001. When he took to the Senate floor to declare his opposition, he said the bill unduly benefited the wealthy. In 2003, Mr. McCain again voted against Mr. Bush's tax cut proposals for similar reasons. He now says he believes the cuts should be made permanent.
 When he was governor of Massachusetts, Mr. Romney declined to take a public position on the tax cuts, but as a candidate he has repeatedly called for making them permanent.
 The Florida race holds high stakes for many of the candidates, particularly Rudolph W. Giuliani, who has said he intends to win here to rescue his flagging candidacy. On Thursday he said he was in the race to stay no matter the outcome of the primary on Tuesday.
 But in this debate, Mr. Giuliani largely escaped scrutiny, even when the candidates were given the chance to engage one another.
 Mr. McCain even called Mr. Giuliani ''an American hero.'' At one point Mr. Giuliani said, ''Senator McCain is right'' in calling for less government spending.
 Not exactly below-the-belt stuff -- and a marked departure from the recent vitriolic debates by the Democrats. Even the candidates seemed a tad surprised.
 ''When Mitt Romney asked me a question, notice he asked me a very nice question,'' Mr. Giuliani said. 
 Behind the scenes, the campaigns were not so polite. The Romney campaign placed an advertisement on the Internet making fun of Mr. McCain -- to the tune of a waltz -- for voting against the Bush tax cuts but now calling for them to be permanent. The McCain campaign struck back with its own Web ad, called ''MittSurfing,'' spoofing Mr. Romney for changing positions on the tax cuts himself.
 The issue came up in more muted fashion at the debate, which was held here at Florida Atlantic University and was sponsored by NBC News, Leadership Florida, the Florida Press Association and Florida Public Broadcasting Service. 
 The candidates often found their credentials on economic issues being tested. Mr. McCain was asked at the outset of the debate about last statements in which he said he did not know as much about the economy as he did about other issues.
 ''Actually, I don't know where you got that quote from,'' he said. ''I'm very well versed in economics.''
 In fact, Mr. McCain was quoted in The Wall Street Journal in 2005 as saying: ''I'm going to be honest. I know a lot less about economics than I do about military and foreign policy issues. I still need to be educated.''
 At another point, defending his conservative credentials, Mr. McCain said he had won among Republicans in the New Hampshire and South Carolina primaries. While he did win those primaries, exit polls suggested that he had not won a majority of Republican votes and that non-Republican voters had made the difference.
 Mike Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor, noted that he had been the only candidate at a debate this fall to sound a warning on the economy. ''When they came to me, I know people acted like I was the only guy at the U.N. without a headset that night,'' Mr. Huckabee said.
 With surveys showing him in third place in Florida, Mr. Giuliani was pressed to explain what had happened to his campaign. He used a sports analogy, saying he would follow in the path of the New York Giants, who are making a surprise appearance in the Super Bowl.
 ''We're going to come from behind and surprise everyone,'' he said. ''We have them all lulled into a very false sense of security.''
 Mr. Romney was pressed to divulge how much money he has given his campaign, given the fact he is blanketing the state in television commercials. When Mr. Romney, who had given more than $17 million to his campaign through the third quarter, demurred, saying he would report the figures when required to at the end of the month, he was asked why he would not tell the voters of Florida now so they could factor the information into their decisions.
 ''I'm not concerned about the voters,'' said Mr. Romney, adding that the amount he had spent was ''competitive information'' he wanted to keep from his rivals. 
 Mr. Romney said he had poured out his own money for his candidacy because he was concerned about the kind of country he was passing on to his children.
 That led Mr. Huckabee to suggest that he be elected so Mr. Romney's five sons would ''inherit a great president'' and ''still get your money.''
 On Iraq, Mr. Huckabee suggested that there might have been weapons of mass destruction there after all, even though they were never found.
 ''Now, everybody can look back and say, 'Oh, well, we didn't find the weapons,' '' he said. ''It doesn't mean they weren't there. Just because you didn't find every Easter egg didn't mean that it wasn't planted.''
 Reports by a team of American inspectors, the Iraq Survey Group, concluded that Iraq did not possess weapons of mass destruction and had not begun any large-scale program to produce such weapons by the time American troops invaded Iraq in 2003.

HEADLINE: Democrats Are Testing Messages in Flood of Ads

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG; David D. Kirkpatrick contributed reporting.

 BODY:
A coast-to-coast onslaught of presidential campaign advertisements began rolling out this week, with Senators Barack Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton already spending millions on commercials in Feb. 5 nominating states on a scale more reminiscent of a general election.
 The spots represent something of a test of the messages that each believes could eventually register with a national audience. 
 In one that made its debut on Wednesday, Mrs. Clinton, whose campaign has been sparring with Mr. Obama all week, instead trains her fire on the current administration, with the words ''Bush did nothing'' streaming across a white screen at one point, a reference to what she characterizes as unheeded warnings of a foreclosure crisis. 
 Mr. Obama uses a new spot to confront concerns about his level of experience, speaking of his role in arms control legislation and ethics reform in the Senate.
 In others, he seeks to introduce himself to an electorate far more familiar with his principal opponent, describing his mother's death from cancer at age 53 as inspiring his plan for universal health care and his father's leaving his mother when he was a small boy as teaching him the value of a solid education. 
 In focusing on particular states and markets, the candidates are also signaling where they hope to compete for the most delegates. So both have put up new spots in recent days in parts of California, Connecticut, Georgia, New Mexico and Utah, with Mr. Obama adding Alabama and Delaware and Mrs. Clinton also setting her sights on Arizona, Massachusetts and Missouri. 
 By choosing to spend several million dollars each on commercials that will run simultaneously in more than a dozen states over the next 10 days -- and, in Mr. Obama's case, on CNN and MSNBC as well -- Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton are being driven by the tight nature of the race thus far and by the bunching of Democratic nominating contests in 22 states on Feb. 5. 
 All told, the Clinton and Obama campaigns are each believed to be spending at least $2 million a week on television advertising in the days before what is being billed as Super Tuesday -- Mr. Obama's cable advertising bill alone is an estimated $1 million -- sums so large that it could make it harder for them to afford advertising in states with later contests if the nomination is not settled that day.
 Even the cable networks said they were caught off guard by the decision of Mr. Obama's campaign to take to the air nationally nearly 10 months before the November election, instead of just focusing on local advertising in states holding contests on Feb. 5.
 By comparison, Senator John Kerry, the Democratic nominee in 2004, did not buy advertising time on CNN until that spring, when his nomination was assured and he began focusing on November. He did not buy time on MSNBC until after the nominating convention that summer.
 ''We're surprised it's been so early,'' said Greg D'Alba, chief operating officer for advertising sales at CNN. ''And this will probably open the door.''
 To that end, another CNN official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said Thursday that the network had been having conversations with the Clinton campaign about the possibility of a national buy.
 On Wednesday, Howard Wolfson, Mrs. Clinton's spokesman, said he would not comment on any future buys. But Mr. Wolfson said it was critically important for the campaign to put up commercials, this week and the next, in so many states at once. 
 ''It's the biggest primary day in the history of the party,'' he said.
 John Edwards, who has yet to win a Democratic nominating contest this season, has advertised on television this week only in South Carolina, which has a Democratic primary on Saturday, but officials said the campaign was considering advertising in California, Georgia, Kansas, Oklahoma and Wisconsin.
 Thus far, those seeking the Republican nomination have been reluctant to follow the lead of Senators Obama and Clinton. Senator John McCain, Mitt Romney and Rudolph W. Giuliani are training their advertisements almost exclusively on Florida Republicans, who vote next Tuesday and whose choice, if decisive, could give one candidate in particular momentum heading into Super Tuesday.
 An aide to Mr. McCain, who had struggled to raise money until taking in $7 million in the new year, said the campaign was daunted by the prospect of advertising in multiple states before Feb. 5. The cost of a statewide television buy in California alone could approach $5 million a week, the aide said. (It is for this reason that the Clinton campaign, at least, has so far advertised in San Francisco, but not Los Angeles, which is more expensive.) 
 In that light, ''the earned media coming out of the Florida win is very, very important,'' the aide said, in reference to the extensive airtime, all free, that the winner of that contest would receive on the cable news channels and network newscasts. ''Riding that wave can be very important.''
 Running through many of the Clinton and Obama spots, regardless of where, are fresh references to the nation's economic downturn, a shift in emphasis from the early nominating states of Iowa and New Hampshire. 
 In one Mr. Obama says, ''I'll be a president who ends the tax breaks for companies that ship our jobs overseas, and put a middle-class tax cut into the hands of working Americans.''
 Similarly, Mrs. Clinton likens ''the Bush economy'' to ''a trap door: too many families are one pink slip, one missed mortgage payment, one medical diagnosis away from falling through and losing everything.''
 Other spots have a more regional focus. In one by the Clinton campaign that made its debut on Tuesday and is running only in California, Mrs. Clinton appears to be speaking directly to commuters stuck on the freeways when she says, ''We've got to get serious about ending our dependence on foreign oil.'' 
 The spot that refers to the foreclosure crisis is running not in California, but in Connecticut and New Mexico, where the campaign appears to believe it will have more resonance.
 By contrast, Mr. Obama emphasizes his health plan in Alabama, Georgia and New Mexico, but is testing a more populist message in Connecticut, Delaware and Utah.
 ''This administration has further divided Wall Street from Main Street,'' he tells voters in those states. ''You've got C.E.O.'s who are making more in 10 minutes than ordinary workers are making in a year.''

HEADLINE: In Turnabout, Mayor Seeks Spending Cuts

BYLINE: By DIANE CARDWELL; Al Baker and Jennifer Medina contributed reporting.

 BODY:
With an already dim fiscal picture turning darker, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg on Thursday proposed a budget that would increase spending by 3.7 percent but cut money from every city department, from sanitation to schools.
 The proposed $58.5 billion spending plan is a sharp departure from those of recent years, when unexpected surpluses fed by booms in the real estate and financial markets allowed the mayor to unveil ambitious new programs. 
 The mayor said the overall spending increase was driven by expenses he said were difficult to control, including Medicaid costs, health care and pensions for employees and debt service. To compensate for those costs and falling revenues, he said, the administration was trimming other spending by roughly 4.3 percent. 
 His plan calls for scaling back subsidies for public libraries, cultural programs, meals for the elderly, tutoring at the City University of New York and summer jobs for youth. The mayor could face a battle as the City Council focuses on those programs, many of which are dear to its members.
 ''We haven't seen the effect of the cuts on the agencies,'' said Councilman David I. Weprin, chairman of the Finance Committee. ''We may be proposing alternative cuts, and we may be arguing for or against certain cuts.''
 Mr. Bloomberg included a popular $400 property tax rebate for homeowners in his budget, but he warned that if the economy continued to sink or if the city did not receive enough state and federal aid, the final budget for the fiscal year beginning in July could include higher property taxes and more severe service cuts.
 ''If we try harder we can all find these kinds of savings without cutting back essential services or even most of the very desirable things that we do,'' Mr. Bloomberg told commissioners and reporters at City Hall. ''If we can't get cooperation, if we can't get help that we're counting on, if we can't get the things that we have been promised in the past,'' he continued, taking aim at Gov. Eliot Spitzer, who is proposing a reduction in aid to the city, ''then I don't think that is possible.''
 Should further cuts become necessary, Mr. Bloomberg said, he would fight hardest to retain the property tax rebate, saying that owners of one-, two- and three-family homes have not really benefited from the extraordinary surges in property values and have had to struggle to meet higher tax burdens.
 Along with the proposed budget, Mr. Bloomberg presented a four-year financial plan that anticipates deficits of about $4.2 billion in the 2010 fiscal year, $5.6 billion in 2011 and $5.3 billion in 2012. Mr. Bloomberg's charts -- which featured more bad news than good, he noted with a wry smile -- showed that in June the city anticipated that Wall Street would generate $16.8 billion in profits in 2007, but now expects just $2.8 billion.
 Nonetheless, Mr. Bloomberg appeared unusually relaxed through the nearly 90-minute presentation, and sought to reassure New Yorkers that while difficult times were ahead, they were not yet dire. He said he thought the economy would continue to decline but had no way to truly know, and urged residents to enjoy themselves.
 ''If you live prudently and put some money away and work hard, you're probably going to be O.K.,'' he said at one point. ''Don't sit there and hunker down and, you know, try to live in a tent.''
 Despite Mr. Bloomberg's assurances, the proposed budget could lead to noticeable service reductions, especially at the Department of Education, which is set for a $324 million cut in the next fiscal year and is undergoing a $180 million reduction in the current fiscal year. Mr. Bloomberg, who won control of the school system in 2002, has staked much of his legacy on its improvement and has generally increased spending or allowed the department to avoid reductions, even in tight times.
 Schools Chancellor Joel I. Klein said that most of the reductions would be passed down to individual schools, with an average of more than $100,000 coming out of each school's budget, although the final figures could vary widely depending on size and demographics.
 Principals will, he said, ''have to tighten some programs,'' like eliminating intensive tutoring on Saturdays or after-school activities.
 ''My theory is that they should have some discretion. Different schools may find that they have to cut back on a program or that they may have to make some adjustment with the staff.''
 While the central administration will make some trims, like reducing costs when purchasing supplies, the brunt of the cuts would fall on the schools. The department will save $1 million by reducing the number of citywide standardized tests to 8, instead of 10 as originally planned, and cut $10 million by eliminating some teaching positions for English as a second language instruction. Mr. Klein defended the decisions, saying that the Education Department had cut $230 million from the central administration office in recent years.
 The city also transferred some spending responsibilities, including paying for computer repairs, to individual schools.
 Randi Weingarten, the president of the United Federation of Teachers, criticized Mr. Klein, saying he did not do enough to protect the education budget and had misplaced priorities.
 ''Instead of looking at all the test-driven materials or looking at the bus contract or looking at other kinds of things where there is fat in the system, the first thing they do is make the schools pay for it,'' she said. ''The chancellor should be the champion of the schools, not cut into the schools.''
 Mr. Bloomberg's proposal, which seeks to reduce overtime costs at a number of agencies, would also cut funds for 1,000 police officer positions that were authorized in richer times, officials said. The move is not likely to have much practical effect on the size of the force since the headcount at the department, which has been facing a recruiting crisis because of low starting salaries, has remained well below the maximum allowed.
 The mayor and his aides portrayed many of the trims as savings realized from greater efficiency or shifting realities, like closing shelters because of a decline in the population of single homeless adults. Pressed on the cuts to the sanitation budget, for example, aides said that garbage truck routes would be consolidated and could not guarantee that residents would see as many pickups. 
 The spending plan does call for new sources of revenue, including a plan to sell naming rights for facilities like pools and recreation centers in city parks.

HEADLINE: Separated by a Quarter-Century of Change, but Linked by Race

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Nearly 25 years of social change, political realignment and demographic shifts separate the presidential candidacies of the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Senator Barack Obama. Even so, there are echoes of 1984 as the battle for the Democratic nomination once again roars across the South, focused squarely on African-Americans.
 The differences can be summed up, in many ways, by two slogans. 
 ''Our time has come'' was Mr. Jackson's rallying cry, a call to political empowerment for Southern blacks who still vividly remembered the struggle for the right to vote, capped by the bloody Selma marches and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Mr. Jackson cast his presidential campaign in 1983-84 as another great step in that movement, an effort to shake up the Democratic Party and ensure that, as he put it, ''Hands that once picked cotton will now pick a president.'' 
 It was an immensely powerful appeal, one that galvanized his audiences as much as that of any presidential candidate in the last 30 years. His candidacy did, in fact, highlight the new power of black voters, the difference their turnout could make and their pivotal role in achieving Democratic majorities, especially in the new South.
 It also changed the Democratic establishment in important ways. ''We understood the moment,'' said Donna Brazile, a top organizer for the 1984 Jackson campaign. ''Jesse had a grievance with the party itself -- it had to be opened up. He gave us all a seat at the table. Look at the Democratic National Committee today compared to the D.N.C. back then.''
 But, as Merle Black, an expert on Southern politics at Emory University, put it, ''I don't think any realistic observer thought Jesse Jackson had a chance'' at the Democratic nomination. In fact, one of the running questions of that campaign, among white Democratic politicians and the pundits, was, ''What does Jesse want?''
 In contrast, one of Mr. Obama's most memorable rallying cries, delivered in his victory speech after the Iowa caucuses, was, ''We are one people, and our time for change has come.'' It was the appeal of a mainstream politician, aimed at voters across the board, delivered to a largely white constituency he had just won. 
 Contrary to stereotypes, ''Obama's base most certainly hasn't been the black vote,'' said David A. Bositis, a senior political analyst at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a research group that focuses on policy issues of concern to African-Americans. ''For most of the past year, that was considered more a part of Hillary's base than Obama's base.'' 
 And Mr. Obama has not regularly wrapped himself in the mantle of the civil rights movement, the hallmark of an earlier generation of black politicians, many of whom had served with the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. As the final stretch of the South Carolina campaign began Sunday, Mr. Obama did take the pulpit of Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, the home church of Dr. King and holy ground for the movement.
 But even there, in a speech laced with the history of the struggle for civil rights, Mr. Obama closed with a message aimed at a biracial, new generation audience: the image of a young white woman, motivated by her mother's health care troubles, and an elderly black man working together for his campaign.
 Another big difference between 1984 and today: Mr. Obama, of Illinois, comes South with a well-financed, full-fledged national campaign and clear credibility as a potential nominee. ''With Obama, you don't know where the train is going to stop,'' Ms. Brazile said. ''This is a different candidate, a different season, a man who transcends race in many ways.''
 There are, however, echoes of 1984 -- arguably more and more in recent days. Back then, Walter F. Mondale, like Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today, had locked up much of the support of the black political establishment in the South early on. When the campaign moved South, and he badly needed some victories, Mr. Mondale discovered that he still had those endorsements but that Mr. Jackson had captured the hearts and minds of black voters.
 Similarly, Mrs. Clinton, of New York, has the support of such black political stalwarts as Representative John Lewis, the Georgia Democrat whose brutal beating in Selma in 1965 helped move a nation's conscience. 
 But polls suggest that Mr. Obama has swept away much of Mrs. Clinton's support among black voters in recent months; in the Nevada caucuses last week, he captured more than three-fourths of the African-American vote, according to voter surveys, compared with Mrs. Clinton's 14 percent. (Mr. Mondale did better in some Southern states in 1984, but Mr. Jackson still won more than three-fourths of the black vote in the primaries over all, according to an analysis by The New York Times.)
 Mr. Jackson himself recently described Mr. Obama as ''riding on the crest of a wave of pride and appreciation,'' adding, ''But it's not just blacks.'' 
 John Norris, who worked for Mr. Jackson's 1988 campaign and is now an adviser to Mr. Obama, argued that both men brought ''new people'' out to vote, ''expanded the pie, if you will.'' 
 Still, even as Mr. Obama's support soars among blacks, he faces a challenge: maintaining the multiracial coalition that is at the heart of his message of change, and that could actually win him the prize that eluded Mr. Jackson in 1984 and 1988.
 How much has racial politics changed in the past 24 years? Blacks and whites were strikingly polarized by the time the 1984 election rolled around, in which President Ronald Reagan carried just 9 percent of the black vote, and two-thirds of the white vote. In some parts of the South, notably Alabama and Mississippi, more than 80 percent of white voters backed Mr. Reagan.
 The prospect of Mr. Obama getting caught in a resurgence of racially polarized politics worries some of his allies. Old racial sensitivities seemed to flare anew in recent weeks after comments by Mrs. Clinton that it ''took a president'' to get civil rights signed into law, which critics said diminished the role of Dr. King, spurring a nasty back-and-forth. 
 Some Obama supporters have accused the Clintons of playing racial politics; one even likened their tactics this week to those of Lee Atwater, the Republican strategist and iconic practitioner of Southern wedge politics, in an interview on CNN. Those charges have been angrily dismissed by the Clinton camp. 
 For Mr. Obama, a candidate trying to chart a new politics beyond old racial and ideological divisions, these are challenging times. They are also, perhaps, revealing times for the state of the country's politics.
 Minyon Moore, who worked for Mr. Jackson in 1988 and now advises the Clinton campaign, said she believed that ''things have changed a great deal'' since the 1980s and that people would decide ''based on whether or not this person is paying attention to issues I care about.''
 Andrew Kohut, president of the Pew Research Center, said, ''I don't think we know the answer to this question, whether we're a good deal less polarized than we were.'' Looking toward the flurry of contests after South Carolina, Mr. Kohut added, ''but we'll get some quick feedback on Feb. 5.''

HEADLINE: Clinton's Campaign Sees Value in Keeping Former President in Attack Mode

BYLINE: By PATRICK HEALY; Katharine Q. Seelye contributed reporting from Walterboro, S.C.

DATELINE: ANDERSON, S.C. 

 BODY:
Advisers to Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton say they have concluded that Bill Clinton's aggressive politicking against Senator Barack Obama is resonating with voters, and they intend to keep him on the campaign trail in a major role after the South Carolina primary.
 The benefits of having Mr. Clinton challenge Mr. Obama so forcefully, over Iraq and Mr. Obama's record and statements, they say, are worth the trade-offs of potentially overshadowing Mrs. Clinton at times, undermining his reputation as a statesman and raising the question among voters about whether they are putting him in the White House as much as her. 
 After three weeks of nearly nonstop campaigning, set off by Mrs. Clinton's third-place finish in the Iowa caucuses, Mr. Clinton has shown as much ability as his wife -- or even more -- to stir public and news media skepticism about Mr. Obama's position on Iraq and his message of nonpartisan leadership, Clinton advisers say.
 Mr. Clinton is deliberately trying to play bad cop against Mr. Obama, campaign officials say, and is keenly aware that a flash of anger or annoyance will draw even more media and public attention to his arguments. He will continue campaigning full-time for Mrs. Clinton after South Carolina in states with primaries on Feb. 5 where he is especially popular, like Arkansas, California and New York, they say.
 They also see benefits in Mr. Clinton's drawing the ire of the Obama camp, predicting that there will be a voter backlash against Mr. Obama if the former president looks like a victim in the cut-and-thrust of the race.
 ''He's the most popular Democrat in the country; he is the most successful president in recent memory, and attacks on him by Senator Obama and his surrogates will be rejected by voters,'' said Howard Wolfson, a Clinton spokesman.
 The Clintons have come full circle: They are truly two-for-the-price-of-one in this presidential race. Mr. Clinton used that phrase when he first ran in 1992, only to back off after voters raised eyebrows, but now the Clintons are all but openly running together as a power couple ready to take office in 2009. Mrs. Clinton views him as a full partner, her advisers say, relying on him over the last few weeks to salvage and steer her campaign.
 Yet some Democrats and political analysts see downsides in Mr. Clinton's outsize role. Given his stature, the former president is potentially sowing deep divisions within a party that until now has been remarkably enthusiastic and unified about the 2008 election. He dispensed this week with any pretense that he was above it all.
 ''Bill Clinton seems to not be in his traditional mode,'' said Jack Bass, an authority on Southern politics at the College of Charleston, who has observed Mr. Clinton for more than 30 years. ''I've just never seen these negative emotions in public before. I know he has a temper, but this confrontational attitude with journalists, and the anger itself, is surprising to me.''
 Mrs. Clinton, meanwhile, has stuck largely to the role of good cop this week, sounding more like a general election candidate as she attacked President Bush over the economy and mostly ignored Mr. Obama. In a speech on the economy on Thursday, she repeatedly attacked Mr. Bush but barely referred to her rival.
 President Bush, she said, ''has stayed at a comfortable cruising altitude, well above the realities of people's lives, delegating responsibility to his advisers, hoping the buck would stop somewhere else.''
 Mr. Clinton, meanwhile, has treaded onto far more combustible ground, like race. He says that people in his audiences ''never'' raise race, but several have. At a forum Wednesday in Kingstree, for example, a black pastor declared, ''Black America is voting for Mr. Obama because he is black.'' Mr. Clinton said he hoped that, for the country's sake, that would not be the case. He also said that he thought no one would be voting against Mr. Obama or Mrs. Clinton on the base of race or sex.
 And yet earlier in the day, in Charleston, he suggested that his wife might lose the primary because of race. ''They are getting votes, to be sure, because of their race or gender,'' Mr. Clinton said, ''and that's why people tell me that Hillary doesn't have a chance to win here.''
 It was not clear if Mr. Clinton was lowering expectations for her in South Carolina, but the polls have done that. Most show her losing the black vote overwhelmingly to Mr. Obama; the question for Mrs. Clinton will be the degree to which white voters turn out and the degree to which they vote for John Edwards.
 David Plouffe, Mr. Obama's campaign manager, said in an interview Thursday that the Clintons were ''throwing everything into winning South Carolina,'' though he added that he was disturbed by ''inaccurate'' attacks on Mr. Obama. Mr. Plouffe cited a Clinton radio advertisement in South Carolina that suggested Mr. Obama liked Republican Party ideas in the 1990s. (The commercial stopped running Thursday; officials said it had been meant only for a 24-hour run.) 
 ''This is not just a spouse or an average surrogate,'' Mr. Plouffe said. ''He's a former president, and I think that comes with a little higher responsibility about what he says and how he says it.'' 
 James Carville, Mr. Clinton's political strategist in 1992, said that the jousting between the two camps had hardly turned toxic, and that the stakes of this election were too high to have a milquetoast campaign.
 ''This is not Williams College students electing a commencement speaker. This is a huge deal,'' Mr. Carville said. ''Does the president risk going overboard? Sure. But Obama runs a risk of being wussified.''
 Several friends and donors to the Clintons say that the idea of Mr. Clinton's going overboard is hard to gauge because he is so enmeshed in the campaign. Both of them have said that he may act as a troubleshooter in foreign and domestic policy. The two sometimes use terms like ''they'' and ''we'' to describe the Clinton candidacy.
 On Thursday, it was Mr. Clinton's voice that appeared in a new radio advertisement here arguing for another Clinton presidency.

HEADLINE: Strains on the I.R.S. Could Delay Rebate Checks for Months

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON

DATELINE: The checks will be in the mail 

 BODY:
eventually.
 But President Bush's plan to send payments to 117 million households to stimulate the economy would impose major strains on the Internal Revenue Service, delays in answering calls to the agency and require a host of technical rules to determine who ultimately collects the benefits, officials said Thursday.
 The deal between the administration and House leaders calls for checks to be issued 60 days after the president signs a law authorizing the one-time payments. That may be in as few as four or five weeks if the full House and the Senate come to terms on the details quickly. 
 In theory, the first checks may arrive in early May, if nothing goes wrong.
 Even as the negotiators crunched the numbers, the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation warned that the tax-filing season could be disrupted and hinted that it might be June before checks were issued.
 I.R.S. computer and other systems ''are today fully engaged in processing 2007 tax returns,'' the committee said Monday in a report. ''As a result, it is not practical to contemplate distributing cash rebates until the peak filing season is completed, which in past years has been the very end of May.''
 At the very least, the agency needs to have in hand the annual returns for last year to know who is married and who has dependent children, information that often changes.
 The size of the checks will also depend on incomes and other factors. For example, individuals would not qualify for the $300 payments if they earned less than $3,000, unless they paid taxes on unearned income like pensions and interest. 
 Although many people who owe no income tax will receive checks, none will be sent to people who pay their taxes through withholding but do not file returns, said Anthony DeSouza, a spokesman for the Treasury Department. Because the withholding tables typically collect slightly more tax than is owed, those nonfilers are seldom pursued. 
 The prospect of collecting the stimulus payments may spur some of those taxpayers to file returns, after all, adding to the logistical strain and increasing the drain on the Treasury, which would have otherwise kept their money.
 Determining who is eligible and for how much money will require major reprogramming of an outdated computer system that relies on technology long since abandoned by business. The software changes will have to be made as an estimated 135 million individual income tax returns arrive between now and April 15.
 The agency has already rushed to adjust its computers because of a temporary patch to reduce the effects of the alternative minimum tax that was not agreed on until just before lawmakers left Washington in December. More than two million taxpayers affected by the alternative tax cannot file until at least Feb. 11.
 Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. told reporters on Thursday that he did not believe the tax patch would affect the new checks. Agency officials who would not speak on the record because they were not authorized were not so sanguine and pointed to the Congressional joint committee report's warnings about adding to the workload in the big filing season.
 Nobody has authorized the agency to hire extra workers to reprogram computers, enter new data, issue checks and answer calls. The agency will divert resources from serving taxpayers and enforcing tax laws.
 A surge in calls accompanied the rebates that Mr. Bush sponsored in 2001, straining the ability to answer calls from people with tax problems and causing other logistical problems.
 Charles O. Rossotti, the executive who was the internal revenue commissioner in 2001, warned amid that rush to issue rebate checks that ''compression of analysis, testing and production of complex programs poses very high risks of errors in issuing these refunds such as taxpayers receiving incorrect amounts or notices with incorrect information.''

HEADLINE: Senate Looking At Endowments As Tuition Rises

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON

 BODY:
The Senate Finance Committee, increasingly concerned about the rising cost of higher education, demanded detailed information on Thursday from the nation's 136 wealthiest colleges and universities on how they raised tuition over the last decade, gave out financial aid and managed and spent their endowments. 
 The committee also asked about endowment-related bonuses paid to college presidents and endowment managers. 
 The move came as a record 76 colleges and universities achieved endowments of $1 billion or more in the last fiscal year, according to a report released this week. Harvard's endowment, the largest, grew 20 percent, to $34.6 billion, while Yale's, the second largest, grew 25 percent, to $22.5 billion.
 ''Tuition has gone up, college presidents' salaries have gone up, and endowments continue to go up and up,'' said Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the ranking Republican on the committee. ''We need to start seeing tuition relief for families go up just as fast.''
 The committee, which has a central role in setting tax policy, has been pressuring universities to use more of their wealth for financial aid and threatening to require them to spend a minimum of 5 percent of their endowments each year, as foundations must. The committee pointed out that donations to universities and their endowment earnings were both tax-exempt.
 Seeking to head off Congressional action, wealthy universities have been rushing in recent months to expand financial aid, in some cases using more of their endowments to increase assistance to low-income and upper-income students alike. Harvard recently said it would increase aid for families earning up to $180,000 a year, and Yale said it would help families with annual incomes of as much as $200,000.
 The request for information came in a letter, signed by Mr. Grassley and the committee chairman, Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana. It provided a strong indication that the committee was not backing off the idea of requiring colleges to spend more of their endowments. 
 Mr. Grassley said that the information gathered in the next 30 days ''will help Congress make informed decisions about a potential pay-out requirement and allow universities to show what they can accomplish on their own initiative.''
 University officials expressed surprise at the broad information request and concern about Congress mandating how they use their endowments. 
 ''I believe that Senator Baucus's and Grassley's intentions may be admirable,'' said Robert J. Birgeneau, chancellor of the University of California, Berkeley, ''but understanding university finances is an extremely complex matter, especially in public colleges and universities.'' Berkeley's endowment is roughly $3 billion.
 Henry S. Bienen, president of Northwestern University, in Evanston, Ill., said that while he believed that putting more information into the open ''will help eliminate many myths and misunderstandings,'' he rejected the proposal that universities be required to spend 5 percent of their endowment assets each year.
 ''Universities are not like foundations,'' Dr. Bienen said. ''They have operating budgets which they cannot easily adjust with the ups and downs of markets. They cannot easily turn off spigots.'' Northwestern, thanks to a recent cash infusion, now has a nearly $7 billion endowment. 
 University officials noted that an economic downturn would reduce the returns on endowments while creating more demand for financial aid. ''People have got used to the last few years of wonderful endowment growth,'' Dr. Bienen added. ''It does not always happen.''
 Lynne Munson, an adjunct research fellow at the Center for College Affordability and Productivity and a vocal critic of college spending practices, said the committee's request was ''unprecedented but important, because colleges and universities have kept endowment spending secret for so long.''
 ''Parents, donors and all taxpayers deserve to know how these tax-free endowment funds are being spent,'' Ms. Munson said.
 Although the Senate letter is not a subpoena, a spokeswoman for the committee said that it was rare for a nonprofit entity not to cooperate with a request for information.
 College tuition has been rising faster than inflation and colleges have adopted complicated aid programs and discounts that have made the pricing of an undergraduate education at an elite college as complicated and varied as the pricing of airline seats.
 Most colleges have far lower endowments and charge less than the ones the committee is addressing.
 The committee's letter, asking for detailed financial information from the universities and colleges across a decade, signaled that lawmakers plan to get deeply into pricing policies. It asks for both the sticker price of tuition and the average and median prices paid by students year by year for 10 years. 
 The committee questioned how the colleges recruit low-income students and how much they spend on these efforts. It also asked who decides when tuition increases are necessary.
 In the matter of endowments, lawmakers sought year-by-year growth and investment returns, and fees paid to investment advisers.
 The senators moved a day after the National Association of College and University Business Officers released its annual endowment study, which showed that the 76 colleges and universities with endowments of $1 billion or more had seen their value rise 21 percent over the previous year. Despite good returns, however, they spent on average only 4.4 percent of their endowments. 
 Mr. Baucus and Mr. Grassley noted the ''explosive'' growth and said, ''That is good news because much good can be done now.''

HEADLINE: Microsoft Delivers Strong Growth And Includes a Sunny Forecast

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
Microsoft reported quarterly sales and profit gains that surpassed Wall Street's expectations and delivered an optimistic outlook Thursday, suggesting that a weakening economy would not slow it down.
 Microsoft's strong performance was led by its three major businesses: personal computer operating systems, office productivity programs and software that runs computers in corporate data centers. The company, the world's largest software maker, continues to struggle and lose money as it battles Google in its new markets for Internet services and online advertising.
 But for Microsoft, that is a financial challenge of the future, one overshadowed by the heft and continuing growth in its personal computer products, led by the Windows Vista operating system and Office 2007. Microsoft's desktop software divisions accounted for 56 percent of the company's revenue and more than 80 percent of the operating profit of its product groups. 
 Microsoft's game console and software business, helped by the best-selling Halo 3 title, has become profitable for the first time.
 ''Microsoft is still investing without much to show for it yet in the online business, but that is kind of nitpicking when you look at the results of the company over all,'' said Charles di Bona, a securities analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. ''The strong performance seems to be pretty much across the board.''
 Investors sent Microsoft's shares up 4 percent in after-hours trading Thursday. The shares closed the regular session at $33.25, up $1.32, or 4.1 percent, after being battered along with other technology stocks this week.
 Other leading technology companies, like Intel and Apple, have reported strong quarterly results, only to have their shares punished after they warned of cloudy outlooks given the increasing possibility of an economic recession. 
 But Microsoft executives still sound confident. In a conference call with analysts, Christopher Liddell, Microsoft's chief financial officer, said, ''We have not seen any significant spillover for an economic slowdown in the U.S.'' 
 Sixty percent of Microsoft's business is now outside the United States, which helps insulate the company from the chill of a slowdown in the American economy. Even so, Mr. Liddell noted that Microsoft's sales in the American market in the last six months had grown at a healthy 15 percent clip.
 For its 2008 fiscal year ending in June, Microsoft offered a bit more optimism. The company said revenue for the year would be $59.9 billion to $60.5 billion, above the analysts' consensus of $59.4 billion. Microsoft said its earnings would be $1.85 to $1.88 a share, up from Wall Street's projection of $1.81 a share.
 For its second quarter, Microsoft reported net income of $4.7 billion, or 50 cents a share, a 79 percent rise compared with a year earlier. Analysts had predicted 46 cents a share. 
 The company reported revenue of nearly $16.4 billion, or 30 percent higher than in the year-earlier quarter. The consensus revenue estimate of securities analysts, as compiled by Thomson Financial, was $15.9 billion.
 The percentage gains in sales and profits in the quarter were inflated by comparison with the year-earlier quarter, when Microsoft deferred $1.64 billion in revenue and operating income because of the delay in shipping Windows Vista and Office 2007. 
 It issued coupons and free upgrades to consumers and businesses that bought personal computers in the holiday season of 2006, allowing them to upgrade to Vista and Office 2007 later.
 Yet after adjusting for the effect of last year's charge, Microsoft still had a stronger-than-expected performance, with revenue rising 15 percent and operating income up 27 percent. 
 Quarterly sales of the client group, which includes Windows Vista, rose 13 percent to more than $4.3 billion. The company's antipiracy programs, working in cooperation with local police in 22 nations, have been particularly effective in the last six months, Mr. Liddell said, representing 3 percentage points of the year-to-year growth.
 The business division, which includes Office, reported sales of $4.8 billion, a 15 percent gain. Most of that comes from Microsoft's popular word-processing, spreadsheet and presentation programs. But Mr. Liddell noted that SharePoint, a program for collaboration by teams of workers, has grown to become a $1 billion-a-year product.
 The entertainment and devices group, which includes the Xbox game consoles and video games, gained only 3 percent in sales, to $3.1 billion. But the year-ago quarter included a surge in revenue from the introduction of the Xbox 360. More significantly, the division reported a $357 million profit this year, compared with a $302 million loss a year ago, as Microsoft sold more games, which are solidly profitable.
 The online services business grew 38 percent to $863 million, helped by the contribution of aQuantive, an online ad agency Microsoft bought last May for $6 billion. But losses more than doubled to $245 million.

HEADLINE: And Triplets Make Seven in Rookie Policeman's Home

BYLINE: By KARI HASKELL

 BODY:
As Boatema Amoah was having her eighth-week sonogram, the technician asked her three times, ''Was this a natural pregnancy?'' 
 ''Yes,'' Ms. Amoah answered patiently, each time. 
 The technician glided the probe back and forth over Ms. Amoah's abdomen and finally said, ''There are three heartbeats.'' 
 ''What? That can't be possible,'' Ms. Amoah, 30, said. Holding her husband's hand tight, she began to cry. ''Do it again,'' she insisted. 
 The technician let Ms. Amoah listen for herself. Bump-bump, bump-bump, bump-bump. There was no mistake.
 ''Not that I'm not happy,'' she said. ''But I can't have three babies inside me, because I already have twins at home.'' 
 Her husband, James Agyapong, 30, gulped before he spoke. 
 ''Everything will be fine,'' he said, though actually he wasn't sure. He is a New York City police officer, with almost two years of service. He has health insurance but works extra shifts to provide for their two children. 
 With three new babies, even with the help of his mother-in-law, he knew his wife could not return to her job as a loan officer. And to add three more people to an already cramped two-bedroom apartment -- how will we even fit? he wondered. 
 Ms. Amoah's concerns were more immediate. Twin girls, Erisha and Shaeril, 8, had been born at 24 weeks, weighing a little over two pounds. The risks of premature birth were even greater with triplets, as were her risks for complications like high blood pressure and diabetes.
 But she was determined to accept whatever would come. ''God does his things in his own way,'' she said. ''I was brought up in Ghana; your child is your child no matter what.'' At home in the Bronx, the couple discussed how their family's expansion would affect an already tight budget. They shop at discount stores -- clothes for $9.99 or less, Ms. Amoah said. And they buy food and household supplies in bulk twice a month at Costco.
 Cases of food are stacked inside and outside the tiny kitchen. They did not really see how they could economize further.
 ''We had the perception that things will work out,'' Ms. Amoah said. ''Just take it one step at a time. He just told me not to worry. He's always like that. It's amazing.'' 
 On Sept. 25, Jeremiah, Jadon and Jared came into the world at 24 weeks, each weighing a little over two and a half pounds. They were taken to the neonatal intensive care unit at Jacobi Medical Center, Ms. Amoah said. 
 ''When triplets are born, it is a big occasion,'' said Margarita Colon, a volunteer social worker at Mosholu-Montefiore Community Center. The center is a beneficiary of the UJA-Federation of New York, which is one of the seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. 
 Ms. Colon was referred to the family by a hospital social worker.
 ''There are a lot of expenses,'' Ms. Colon said. She talked with Ms. Amoah about the family finances, asking how they would manage.
 Pulling $2,500 from the Neediest Cases Fund, Ms. Colon was able to offer the family some respite.
 With it, they paid almost $900 for a month's rent and utilities, and they bought car seats, cribs and bassinets. ''She was like our guardian angel,'' said Ms. Amoah of Ms. Colon. 
 Jadon was the first to leave the hospital, arriving home on Dec. 8. Jeremiah, who did not gain weight as fast as the doctors would have liked, came home on Jan. 8, and Jared, who has had more serious respiratory problems than his brothers, is expected home by Feb. 8. 
 ''I don't know what we are going to do about the space,'' Mr. Agyapong said. Their apartment looks like a storage room in a children's store. Baby shower gifts are tucked behind a plump L-shaped couch, and a crib is wedged between part of the couch and the Christmas tree, which is still up.
 They have put in a request to their management company for an apartment with another bedroom. 
 ''It's decided by a lottery,'' Mr. Agyapong said, adding optimistically, ''Something will turn up.'' 
 Until then, he and his wife are staying focused on the children. ''We are blessed.''

HEADLINE: Who Has the Optimism? The Have-Nots

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

DATELINE: DAVOS, Switzerland 

 BODY:
 THE future looks bleak in much of the developed world. It looks bright in the developing world.
 Two opinion surveys released in connection with the World Economic Forum here showed optimism among corporate chief executives and the public in many emerging markets. But there are doubts in many of the world's leading economies. 
 In the United States, just 27 percent of the people questioned in the Gallup International Voice of the People survey said they expected the next generation to be more prosperous than the current one, while 43 percent expected less prosperity.
 Fear that the future will be worse is even greater in some other countries. In France, only 11 percent of respondents said they expected a more prosperous future. The figures in Japan, Germany and Italy were almost that low.
 But in Nigeria, a country whose oil wealth has so far done little for most of its citizens, 78 percent said they expected a more prosperous future. In Kenya, the figure was 67 percent. (All the polls were taken during the fourth quarter of 2007, before a disputed election led to instability in Kenya, and before financial markets worldwide suffered this month.)
 The question asked of chief executives covered a much narrower issue -- whether they were very confident that their own company's revenue would grow over the next 12 months. 
 In the United States, where recession fears have been rising, 36 percent of the executives said they were very confident, a percentage that exceeded the figures for Japan, France and Italy. 
 By contrast, the figures exceeded 70 percent in Mexico, Russia and China. In India, the number was 90 percent.
 The confidence of emerging markets was shown in sessions at the forum this week, as participants from India proclaimed that their momentum could carry them past any downturn in the United States. 
 One Chinese speaker said a recession in the United States might bring China's growth down to 9 percent a year, from the 10 to 11 percent he expected otherwise.
 ''A lot of people are going to be very shocked'' if a recession in the United States does have a major impact on Asia, said Steven S. Roach, the chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia, who has long been bullish on the region. But he also said he expected the American downturn to have a substantial impact in Asia. 
 The poll of individuals also asked whether they agreed with certain statements about business leaders, and found a wide variety of opinions.
 Business leaders were generally viewed as more competent than political leaders, but they were also seen as dishonest by many. 
 The starkest view was in Germany, where only 6 percent thought the business leaders were not competent and capable, but 71 percent thought they were dishonest. In the United States, 49 percent said they thought business executives were dishonest, while 25 percent did not think they were competent.
 The country with the highest regard for its business leaders appears to be Britain, where only 19 percent viewed them as dishonest, and 13 percent doubted their competence.
 But perhaps some people do not think it is necessary to have competent business executives for a country to prosper. Nigeria, the country where 78 percent of the public expect the next generation to be more prosperous, had 40 percent of its respondents say business leaders were not competent. That was the most of any of the countries listed in the accompanying charts.

HEADLINE: Down Day, but Week Is Best of the Year

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
After two days of stunning gains, Wall Street ended a tumultuous week with a sharp decline Friday as investors turned cautious and cashed in some of their profits. The Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 170 points but still managed to record its first weekly advance of 2008.
 Investors had an initial burst of enthusiasm Friday, sending each of the major indexes up more than 1 percent, after upbeat profit reports from big names like Microsoft and word of a possible buyout of a troubled bond insurer. 
 But the advance was short-lived, and the eventual decline was not surprising given that investors putting down bets ahead of the weekend were coming off two days of big gains, including 400 points in the Dow.
 ''People may be looking to take some profits off the table in this volatile market. And there's a lot of activity that's coming up next week,'' said Scott Fullman, director of investment strategy for I. A. Englander & Company.
 President Bush is scheduled to deliver his State of the Union address Monday. The Federal Reserve is scheduled to hold its first regularly scheduled meeting of the year Tuesday and Wednesday, and the Labor Department will weigh in on the state of the job market Friday.
 The Dow fell 171.44, or 1.38 percent, to 12,207.17, after rising more than 100 points earlier.
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 21.46, or 1.59 percent, to 1,330.61. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 34.72, or 1.47 percent, to 2,326.20.
 The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 4.12, or 0.59 percent, to 688.60.
 For the week, stocks finished not far beyond where they began. The Dow added 108 points, or 0.89 percent. The S.& P. 500 ended the week up 0.41 percent, and the Nasdaq lost 0.59 percent. Despite the increases logged this week, stocks are still down sharply in the new year.
 Wall Street's tone Friday stood in sharp contrast to the intensely dour mood that hung over the market when the week began. While United States markets were closed Monday for Martin Luther King's Birthday, stocks in Asia and Europe plunged amid fears of a precipitous slowdown in the American economy. 
 To stave off a similar sell-off over recession fears, the Fed stepped in before the opening bell Tuesday with an emergency interest rate cut. Still, the Dow plunged 465 points soon after opening.
 The central bank's move to cut rates by three-quarters of a percentage point, to 3.5 percent, helped shore up investors' confidence. Stocks ended Tuesday down, but well off their lows. In an astonishing about-face on Wednesday, the Dow swung more than 600 points and turned a sharp sell-off into huge gains. Stocks then extended their advance Thursday.
 The Fed is widely expected to cut rates again at next week's meeting; many analysts expect a half-point cut.
 The market might well be following the pattern of past corrections, when huge gains were often followed by some retrenchment. 
 ''The market is extremely sensitive to any news that's out there,'' Mr. Fullman, the investment strategist, said. ''A year ago, it brushed off a lot of stuff. Now, it's just the opposite, and we're seeing reactions nearly immediately when things come out.''
 Wall Street still appeared pleased by reports from British newspapers that the billionaire Wilbur L. Ross was in talks to acquire the bond insurer Ambac Financial Group. Financial woes at many American bond insurers have worried investors worldwide who fear that tightness in the credit markets could worsen should one of the companies buckle. Ambac rose 21 cents, to $11.54.
 Microsoft finished down 31 cents, at $32.94, after spending much of the session higher. The company raised its forecast for the rest of its fiscal year, which ends in June, and said its quarterly earnings jumped 79 percent.
 Light crude oil advanced $1.30, to settle at $90.71 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 Government bond prices jumped as stocks declined. The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose more than a full point, to 105 21/32. Its yield, which moves opposite its price, fell to 3.56 percent, from 3.70 percent.

HEADLINE: Caterpillar Increases Profit With Strong Overseas Growth

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Caterpillar, one of the world's largest construction equipment makers, said Friday that its fourth-quarter earnings rose 11 percent on strong international growth.
 The company, based in Peoria, Ill., said it expected solid profit growth from overseas sales this year as well. 
 Caterpillar earned $975 million, or $1.50 a share, compared with $882 million, or $1.32 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 10 percent, to $12.14 billion, from $11 billion in the prior-year period.
 Analysts were expecting a profit of $1.50 a share on revenue of $11.79 billion, according to a poll by Thomson Financial.
 Caterpillar expects economic growth in the Unites States to slow to 1 percent this year, partly because of continued weakness in home construction.
 But Caterpillar's chief executive, James W. Owens, said strong economic growth outside the United States would offset weak domestic demand. ''Global markets for mining, energy and infrastructure development are booming,'' he said in a statement.
 The company is predicting profit growth of 5 to 15 percent in 2008, on revenue that will rise 5 to 10 percent year-over-year. The prediction implies 2008 profit of $5.64 to $6.18 a share on revenue of $44.06 billion to $46.16 billion.
 Almost 60 percent of Caterpillar's fourth-quarter sales were outside North America, an almost 10 percent increase from just a year earlier.
 The company said it also benefited from the weak dollar. Currency fluctuations added $334 million to fourth-quarter revenue, Caterpillar said.
 The company plans to spend $2.3 billion this year to add production capacity to deal with order backlogs of construction equipment and other products, a 35 percent increase.
 Caterpillar shares rose 68 cents, to $65.93.

HEADLINE: Is Housing Starting To Thaw, At Least a Bit?

BYLINE: By DAVID STREITFELD; Vikas Bajaj contributed reporting from New York, Brenda Goodman from Atlanta, Will Carless from San Diego and Joan Raymond from Cleveland.

DATELINE: ROMEOVILLE, Ill. 

 BODY:
The temperature was in the single digits and the forecast for the real estate market was even chillier, but Fran and Mark Gable went out the other day to see about buying a four-bedroom house.
 ''Blood in the streets!'' Ms. Gable said cheerfully. ''That's the best time to buy.''
 They are in their early 30s, expecting their first child, looking for something with a bigger family room that is also a little closer to Ms. Gable's job with Volvo Parts North America. ''We're willing to take a chance,'' she said.
 With the goal of encouraging many others to make a similar gamble, various arms of the federal government swung into action this week. The Federal Reserve sliced interest rates by the largest single amount on record, while the House and President Bush forged a $150 billion stimulus plan. To prod the moribund housing market on the high-priced coasts, the aid package includes provisions that should make it easier for consumers to get mortgages up to $600,000 or more. 
 Susanne Cannon, the director of the Real Estate Center at DePaul University, said she was at a conference in Florida this month with other academics who specialize in housing. ''The informal consensus was that an awful lot of people have been waiting to buy a house because they want to see where the floor is,'' she said.
 This week, the average 30-year fixed rate was 5.48 percent; the rate was approaching 7 percent as recently as last summer.
 Now that lower rates are a factor, Ms. Cannon said, the question becomes: At what point will buyers be compelled to act, thinking they are getting a price they can live with and a rate they do not want to miss?
 One indisputable effect of the Fed action is a rise in refinancing applications, continuing a trend that started late last year.
 The New York Loan Exchange, a marketplace used by mortgage companies and the investment banks they sell loans to, experienced a big spike in activity starting Tuesday as loan officers logged on to see if they could get lower rates for borrowers.
 John Alexander, president of the exchange, said the demand and his conversations with lenders indicated that many borrowers were hoping to refinance but had been unable to do so because lenders' credit standards had tightened significantly.
 Purchase applications are a different story. The Mortgage Bankers Association said they rose a mere 7 percent in the two months leading up to the rate cut.
 Kimberly Raber, a sales assistant at a pharmaceutical company, is doing her best to raise that number. She lives in a cramped apartment in Vista, Calif., with her fiance and their two children. For six months, they have been looking for a bigger place. 
 Ms. Raber liked a three-bedroom condo, but repeated negotiations with the seller yielded only a stalemate. He would not go below $377,000, and she could not go above $363,000.
 ''Now that the rates have gone down, we're hoping to meet in the middle,'' said Ms. Raber, 36.
 In Atlanta, Jerome Anderson, 43, said he saw on TV that interest rates were dropping and said to himself, ''Now's the time.''
 He said he planned to invest ''probably about $400,000'' into three duplexes in the transitional neighborhood of Vine City. ''The rental market is very hot,'' he said. ''That's my plan -- to buy cheap, rent to families cheap.''
 Mr. Anderson's agent, Otha Greer with Coldwell Banker, said he was not alone.
 The drop in rates ''has lit the fire in my business,'' Ms. Greer said. ''I actually had an investor that called yesterday and she's interested in buying five homes.''
 Among sellers, too, the cut is inspiring flickers of optimism.
 Jody and Nicholas LeCursi tried to sell their home in Jackson, Mich., for two years. The initial price was $102,000, which produced no nibbles. Switching agents and lowering the price to $98,000 did not help.
 In October, they took the home off the market so they could remodel a bathroom and bedroom. When the work is done, they said, they will try to sell the home again, probably at a lower price. They calculate that a buyer could pay as little as $700 a month.
 ''Why would someone want to rent if they could own and pay the same thing?'' asked Ms. LeCursi, who works in rehabilitation at the University of Michigan in nearby Ann Arbor. ''People need incentive. Hopefully, that rate cut will supply it.''
 Such is the depth of the downturn, however, that for many, the incentives are not enough.
 ''I don't have anyone interested in refinancing,'' said Patricia Nosan Bednarcik, an agent in hard-hit Cleveland. ''Dollars to doughnuts, most people probably owe more than what the house is worth right now. And that's a problem since housing prices will probably fall even more.''
 That is as much an article of faith in the current environment as was the conviction in 2004 that prices would never go down. Indeed, the forecasts now are getting bleaker.
 A Merrill Lynch report this week said housing prices were ''likely to remain in free fall.'' The report predicted a drop of 15 percent this year, 10 percent next year and ''more depreciation likely beyond the forecast period'' -- despite an expected series of rate cuts.
 In an uphill battle to combat such attitudes, the National Association of Realtors started a print, radio and television ad campaign this month that emphasizes real estate as an investment. ''If you purchase one of the millions of homes that will be sold this year, the National Association of Realtors wants you to know that you're making a good move,'' says one of the TV ads. 
 Jim Klinge, an agent in San Diego, said he began the week thinking he knew what the bottom would look like. ''People are going to be so freaked out, they won't buy no matter what the price is.''
 Right after the rate cut he got a call from a so-called ''bubble sitter'' -- a man who sold his house at the peak and started renting, convinced that he could sit out the downturn and buy again at the bottom.
 ''The cut gave him a nice feeling, but it wasn't enough to get him to buy, or even get in his car to go look,'' Mr. Klinge said. 
 By Friday, however, Mr. Klinge had shifted his position. He appreciated how the Fed cut and the proposed changes in loan limits were attempts to improve sentiment. 
 Raising the loan limits is especially significant in high-priced California. As part of the stimulus legislation before Congress, lenders for a year would be able to sell much larger loans to the havens of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-backed mortgage finance companies. The limit would increase from the current $417,000 to at least $625,500 and possible as much as $729,750. The exact amount is still being negotiated.
 That should make refinancings easier, and would probably encourage sales activity, too. The same is true of another provision of the plan, to increase the limit on loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration to $729,750. 
 Mr. Klinge said he also realized something else. He was closing his fifth deal this month, a decided improvement from the 16 houses he sold in all of 2007. 
 ''It's very hard to find the right house at the right price,'' he said, ''but there's a strong undercurrent of very healthy demand.''

HEADLINE: Scottish & Newcastle Agrees to Be Bought and Split

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
Scottish & Newcastle, Britain's largest brewer, agreed on Friday to a $:7.8 billion ($15.4 billion) takeover by the European rivals Carlsberg and Heineken.
 After three months of negotiating on the price, Carlsberg and Heineken agreed to pay $:8 in cash for each share of Scottish & Newcastle, which makes Foster's and Kronenbourg 1664 beer. The takeover offer represents a 26 percent premium to the value of Scottish & Newcastle's shares on Oct. 16, a day before the two companies said they were considering a takeover. They raised their bid three times from an initial offer of $:7.2 a share. 
 ''The deal is not cheap, but it offers some opportunities,'' said Marcel Hooijmaijers, an analyst at Landsbanki Kepler in Amsterdam. 
 A smoking ban in pubs and bars and consumer worries about rising living costs and slowing economic growth have hurt sales at brewers, leading them to explore takeovers in faster-growing markets like Russia and search for ways to gain market share at home. 
 SABMiller, one of the world's largest brewers, accelerated consolidation in the industry when it and Molson Coors Brewing merged their United States units and it bought Royal Grolsch, Heineken's closest Dutch rival, for $1.2 billion last year.
 In an unusual transaction, Carlsberg of Denmark and Heineken will divide Scottish & Newcastle's assets between them and share the bill, with Carlsberg taking a slightly larger part. Heineken will obtain the British business, and Carlsberg will take full control of Russia's largest brewer, which it owned with Scottish & Newcastle. The deal is unusual because Heineken and Carlsberg are helping each other increase their share of some markets in which they are direct competitors.
 The acquisition will make Carlsberg ''the world's fastest-growing global brewer,'' Carlsberg's chief executive, Jorgen Buhl Rasmussen, said in a statement. Heineken's chief executive, Jean-Francois van Boxmeer, said it was a ''significant step'' for Heineken and creates ''opportunities in profitable markets to grow the premium Heineken brand.''
 The takeover will give Heineken access to Britain's cider market, which is growing 18.6 percent a year and is expected to help offset falling beer sales. Heineken said it expected to save $:120 million a year from the transaction. 
 It will also get Scottish & Newcastle's businesses in Ireland, Portugal, Finland, Belgium, the United States and India, where the British company owns a minority stake in United Breweries, the owner of Kingfisher beer.
 Heineken has been reluctant to pay up for takeovers in the past, but a decline in market share and available acquisition targets prompted the bid for Scottish & Newcastle's assets, some analysts said. 
 The Dutch brewer backed out of a plan in 2005 to buy Grupo Empresarial Bavaria of Colombia, which was then acquired for $5.6 billion by SABMiller. Its largest purchase was the 1.9 billion euro takeover of the Austrian brewer BBAG in 2003. 
 Baltic Beverages Holdings, the Russian brewer that Carlsberg is gaining control of, is expected to increase earnings before interest and taxes by 34 percent, to 990 million euros ($1.5 billion) by 2010 as Russia's beer market is expected to grow 5 percent this year. That compares with a 5.7 percent drop in beer sales in Britain's bars and pubs in the first half and a 4.5 percent drop at supermarkets and convenience stores, according to Scottish & Newcastle.
 Carlsberg will also obtain its operations in France, Greece, China and Vietnam.

HEADLINE: As Egypt Tries to Plug Border, Gazans Poke New Hole

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER; Taghreed El-Khodary contributed reporting from Rafah, Gaza, and Nadim Audi from El Arish, Egypt.

DATELINE: GAZA 

 BODY:
Egypt tried to restore its border with Gaza on Friday, stationing riot police officers in an effort to block Palestinians from entering. But Palestinians used a bulldozer to knock down another portion of the wall separating Egypt and Gaza.
 The Egyptians announced on loudspeakers that the border would be closed at various times of the day on Friday, but allowed Palestinians who were inside Egypt to return to Gaza laden with goods, even as cranes lifted pallets of supplies over another part of the border barricade. The barrier on the Egyptian side is a low concrete wall topped with barbed wire.
 There were small clashes throughout the day, with short episodes of rock-throwing. Egyptians fired guns into the air and aimed water cannons above the heads of the those in the crowd to keep them back. The new breaches in the wall were large enough for cars and trucks to drive through, and some Egyptian guards then retreated.
 Egypt is under pressure from Israel and the United States to restore the international border and regulate it, but does not want to use excessive force against the Gazans, whom the Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, has insisted are starving under the pressure of Israeli restrictions on imports and travel. 
 But often in the past, Egypt has used force, including water cannons and automatic-rifle fire, against Palestinians who have breached the border, and the government will be calculating when its effort to respond generously to a crisis veers into instability or chaos. Nor does Egypt want responsibility for serving the population of Gaza, removing the burden from Israel.
 Hamas is trying to push Egypt into an agreement to regulate the border without having it sealed, as it had been from the time Hamas took over Gaza in early June. A Hamas spokesman, Sami Abu Zuhri, said, ''The gaps shouldn't be closed because they provide urgent assistance to the Palestinians.''
 Israeli officials have expressed increasing concern to the Egyptian and United States governments that Hamas and other Palestinian militant groups are using the border breach to import military supplies and to send out fighters for training or terrorism.
 Israel has raised its security alert for the Sinai and warned its citizens not to travel to the region's popular beaches, fearing attacks there, and is saying it has credible reports of new efforts to smuggle gunmen and suicide bombers through the Sinai into Israel. The last suicide bombing in Israel, in the southern resort town of Eilat a year ago, was carried out by a militant who had traveled there through the Sinai.
 Hamas broke the border barrier in nearly 20 places early Wednesday morning, and Egypt, with no real alternative, has allowed perhaps 200,000 Palestinians to enter to buy food, cigarettes, medicine and other consumer goods. The trade has become increasingly commercial.
 On Friday evening, the exiled chief of the Hamas political bureau, Khaled Meshal, told Reuters in Damascus, Syria, that he had accepted an invitation from Mr. Mubarak to hold further unity talks in Cairo with Mahmoud Abbas, who is the Fatah leader and the Palestinian president. Fatah controls the West Bank.
 ''I and all the brothers in the Hamas leadership welcome participating and will seek to make the dialogue a success,'' Mr. Meshal said. There was no immediate confirmation from Mr. Abbas, who is scheduled to meet the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Olmert, on Sunday. 
 Gazans in El Arish, the largest Egyptian town close to the border, said they had been told to leave by 7 p.m. The provincial capital, El Arish has an airport and is known for its beaches and seafood restaurants. Thousands of Palestinians were still there on Friday afternoon, complaining about the near doubling of normal prices, but happy about their chance to get out of Gaza, and even melancholic about having to return, as if on the last day of a vacation.
 Muhammad al-Hirakly, 22, said he and his friends had been in El Arish for two days, but could not get past the police to get to Cairo. ''We tried to go there, to see the big city and our family there, and also the girls,'' he said.
 The police ordered local hotels not to take in Palestinians, but residents and mosques provided beds. ''We've been sleeping in the Rifai Mosque. It's nice they let us in,'' Mr. Hirakly said. He was interviewed in a line to ride the bumper cars at a little amusement park. ''We're angry at the Egyptians, who try to rob us with overpriced stuff,'' he said. ''But it's the most fun we've had in years.''
 Muhammad Abu Samra, 18, came to buy cigarettes to resell and found many friends from Gaza. ''Being here makes me feel like I want to see the world, breathe some fresh air,'' he said. ''I wish they could keep the border open; maybe one day they'll even let us go to Cairo.'' But said he and his friends planned to return to Gaza on Friday night.
 Adel al-Mighraky, 54, was returning to the Rafah crossing with his grandson, and thanked Mr. Mubarak for allowing Gazans to enter. ''We were like birds in a cage,'' he said. Once the door is open, he said, ''birds will fly away as fast as they can -- this is what we did. But what kind of bird has to go back to its cage after it was freed?''
 It was the first time his grandson had left Gaza, Mr. Mighraky said. ''We felt free today.''
 Mr. Olmert is expected to discuss the Gaza crisis along with peace talks in his Sunday meeting with Mr. Abbas. Israel is considering the possibility of granting the request of Mr. Abbas and the prime minister based in Ramallah, Salam Fayyad, to let the Palestinian Authority control the crossings between Israel and Gaza, allowing them to reopen.
 Israel had previously rejected the idea, because it would loosen the economic squeeze on Hamas, which intensified last week when Israel decided to cut off shipments into Gaza, including fuel for the local power plant, in response to rocket attacks from Gaza. That move produced international protests and the Hamas decision to breach the border with Egypt. 
 Early on Friday, Israel killed the Hamas military commander of Rafah, Muhammad Harb, and a deputy when planes fired on his car near the border. He was said to have commanded the men who blew down the border wall and, Israel said, was involved in a raid into Israel in 2006, when Cpl. Gilad Shalit was captured. Late Thursday night, Israeli rockets hit the jeep of two other Hamas fighters in Rafah, killing them.
 On Thursday night, at a checkpoint in East Jerusalem, an Israeli policeman was killed and a policewoman wounded, and Palestinian militants were suspected. On Friday, Israeli troops killed a Palestinian in Beit Omar in the West Bank when they entered to search the houses of two militants who were killed Thursday as they attacked a Jewish settlement south of Jerusalem.

HEADLINE: U.S. Ignores Finding on Student Lender

BYLINE: By JONATHAN D. GLATER

 BODY:
The Education Department has brushed aside a finding by its own inspector general that a student lender improperly received $34 million in federal subsidies, and is instructing the lender to decide for itself how much money it should pay back. 
 In a letter sent Friday to the Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency, a state-owned company that makes and guarantees student loans, the department said it had estimated the overpayment at only $15.1 million, and said in a separate letter that it agreed with only some of the findings of the inspector general. But it told the agency to calculate for itself the amount it thought it had overbilled the government. Any final payment would require the approval of the Education Department. 
 The agency ''must provide a detailed explanation of its plan to identify affected loans and to calculate overpayments,'' which would be deducted from future reimbursement requests, wrote Patricia Trubia, a department official, in the letter. 
 Keith New, a spokesman for the Pennsylvania agency, said it was ''very pleased'' with the department's letter, and that it would continue to negotiate with the department over any repayment obligation.
 ''We could wind up with zero liability,'' Mr. New said.
 Department officials declined to comment on what the resolution of the case could be.
 The Education Department's inspector found in November that the Pennsylvania agency overbilled the government by $34 million under a subsidy program enacted in the 1980s to make issuing loans to students more attractive at a time of high interest rates. Congress tried to rein in the program in 1993, as rates fell, but the loans ballooned as lenders exploited a loophole to keep receiving the subsidies. 
 Michael Dannenberg, director of the education policy program at the New America Foundation in Washington, sharply criticized the department's decision to seek less than the amount identified in the audit. 
 ''The department's going after less than half of a fraction of the larger amount of improper billing that the Pennsylvania lending agency engaged in,'' Mr. Dannenberg said. ''The Department of Education's failure to aggressively police the student loan industry has hurt taxpayers and students, and this is the latest example.'' 
 Representative George Miller, the California Democrat who is the chairman of the House Education and Labor Committee and a critic of the department's oversight of student lending, also lashed out. 
 ''Today's action doesn't erase the administration's failure last year to recover hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars misspent by Nelnet,'' Mr. Miller said Friday in a statement, referring to the large student lender based in Nebraska. Last year the department allowed Nelnet to keep $278 million in subsidies that its inspector general had concluded were improper.
 ''While I am disappointed that the department is not seeking to collect the full amount recommended by the inspector general,'' Mr. Miller added, ''I hope that this decision is a sign that the department is finally starting to take its role as the steward of our nation's federal student aid programs seriously.''

HEADLINE: Union Membership Up 311,000 in '07, Biggest Rise Since '83

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
The roll of American workers belonging to labor unions climbed last year by the largest number since 1983, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday.
 Union membership rose by 311,000, to 15.7 million, the bureau said, despite a decline in such membership in manufacturing, long organized labor's stronghold. 
 As a result, union membership as a share of the total work force rose last year for the first time in a quarter-century, inching up to 12.1 percent from 12 percent the year before. A total of 7.5 percent of private-sector workers were in unions, and 35.9 percent of public-sector workers.
 Labor leaders hailed the increase, saying it was a harbinger that the union movement, which represented 20.1 percent of the work force in 1983, was bottoming out after decades of decline.
 But some economists questioned whether the numbers in fact signaled a turnaround. In an analysis for the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research, Ben Zipperer and John Schmitt wrote that ''the increase is small and may well reflect statistical variation rather than an actual increase.'' 
 Still, many labor experts had been expecting an actual decline in membership, largely because of a sharp drop in manufacturing jobs, especially in the automobile industry. The bureau's report showed that for the first time, Western states had a higher unionization rate last year, 14.7 percent, than did the Midwest, 13.8 percent.
 Membership grew most strongly in construction and health services, it found. 
 ''We're pleased but not satisfied,'' Stewart Acuff, organizing director of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said of the report. ''It is significant that these numbers represent real growth.''
 Mr. Acuff said the increase had resulted from a variety of unionization drives, including those that organized 40,000 child care workers in Michigan and more than 40,000 child care workers in New York.

HEADLINE: Hate to Spoil A Weekend, But ...

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA

 BODY:
Back in his mid-1980s heyday, when he was America's most famous investor, managing America's most famous mutual fund, Peter Lynch used to hate Mondays. Monday, you see, was the day the market was most likely to go down; according to research Mr. Lynch had compiled, from 1955 to 1985, it dropped by a cumulative 1,500 points just on that one day.
 Mr. Lynch, who for 12 years ran Fidelity's Magellan Fund, had a simple theory as to why this was the case: negative thinking. ''The reason for the Monday decline,'' he once told me, ''is that on the weekend everyone becomes an amateur economist.'' Investors, he believed, would read the weekend newspapers, filled with their articles of doom and gloom, and become filled with doom and gloom themselves. Naturally, their first instinct was to sell when the market opened on Monday.
 Sigh. This is a weekend newspaper. You may want to stop reading now, Peter. 
 I don't see how you can avoid a certain amount of gloom given the week we've just had -- and its implications for the future. Yes, things were a little less crazy on Thursday and Friday, but the early part of the week was just awful. On Monday, our markets were closed for Martin Luther King's Birthday, but all over the world, stock markets were in free fall. On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 464 points at the open, and closed with a loss of 128 points. On Wednesday we had the so-called whiplash rally -- from a 300-point morning deficit, the market swung to a nearly 300-point gain. Even with the gain, a 600-point swing doesn't exactly inspire confidence. It inspires fear.
 Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve announced an emergency rate drop of three-quarters of a point, in a move that smelled an awful lot like panic. Economists were debating whether the economy was nearing a recession -- or was already in one. The New York State Insurance superintendent sought a bailout plan for the major bond insurers, fearing disaster if they failed. Housing prices continued to drop. Further write-downs by the major financial institutions seemed all but certain. All the things that the bears have been predicting were coming to pass, and it was hard to know when -- or how -- it would end.
 ''This is nothing like I've ever seen,'' said Peter Bernstein, the author and market sage -- and a man who has pretty much seen it all. Normally, he said, bear markets set in when stock values get out of hand, as was the case when the tech bubble burst in 2000. But not this time. The market is in trouble because the larger economy is in trouble. ''The collapse of credit is what is driving this recession,'' he said.
 Mr. Bernstein added: ''Unsnarling the financial system and getting back to a vibrant risk-taking financial system is going to take time. If people have to start borrowing the old-fashioned way -- that is going to be an adjustment. I have no sense of how bad it is going to be, but I think it is going to last beyond 2008.''
 Daniel Alpert, a managing director of Westwood Capital, wrote: ''In past debt debacles, and other market crises, the affected assets have been things like commercial real estate, farmland, tech stocks and bank shares. This time around, along with the stock market, it is people's homes, the repricing of which literally hits us where we live.'' Mr. Alpert made the point that in just the first six years of this decade, mortgage debt and consumer debt have both doubled; indeed, he predicted that credit card debt will be the next shoe to drop.
 Stephen Roach, Morgan Stanley's former chief economist -- he is now chairman of its Asia division -- told me that private consumption in recent years amounted to 72 percent of gross domestic product, far higher than the 66 percent it had been just a few years before.
 David A. Rosenberg, the North American economist for Merrill Lynch and the author of a devastating report on the state of the economy, said, ''When you look at private-sector debt that was over and above what can be explained by G.D.P., you are talking about $6.5 trillion beyond the economy's capacity to handle that debt.'' That debt will have to be either written off or paid back. People will have to stop spending, he said; they'll have no other choice. ''The problems are deep, widespread and intense,'' he said.
 Is that gloom and doom enough for you? More to the point, are you ready to face a world in which your two biggest assets, your retirement account and your home, don't automatically go up? Just as individuals assumed their homes could only go up, the larger society has, over the past few decades, been built around the idea that rising asset values will always take care of our financial problems. What the events of this week suggest is that maybe they won't.
 If you're a middle-aged baby boomer like me, you probably first got interested in the stock market -- and real estate, for that matter -- in the early 1980s, when the great bull market began. The era before then, from 1969 to 1982, when the market did nothing, and BusinessWeek could write its infamous cover line, ''The Death of Equities'' -- is not really part of our collective memory.
 Starting with the crash of 1987, every time there has been a market break, it always snapped back, usually sooner rather than later. Every time housing prices faltered -- as they did in the early 1990s -- they quickly snapped back as well. As a result, those twin engines, stocks and homes, became the assets we absolutely came to depend on to live the life we wanted. Our employers made the broad transition from pension plans -- where the risk was spread broadly and the companies were responsible for their employees' retirement -- to 401(k) plans, where the risk was shifted entirely to the employees. But we were O.K. with that, weren't we? We were happy to assume that risk because the market's inevitable rise would secure for us a decent retirement. 
 Similarly, our home offered us the ability to buy things we wanted -- vacations, for instance, or second homes -- because we learned that we could borrow against the equity. The rise in the value of that asset made the prospect of repayment relatively painless. It also allowed us to avoid facing the fact that our incomes weren't keeping pace with our desires. 
 But the crazy run-up in home prices since the new century began was unsustainable, and the trillions borrowed against home equity that has since vanished has now become the great overhang in our economy. Consumer spending will slow because people need to pay off that debt instead of taking another vacation. It will also slow because it scares people to know that their chief assets are no longer doing what they are ''supposed'' to be doing. ''Their strategy of borrowing against their homes has left them vulnerable,'' said Jacob S. Hacker, the author of ''The Great Risk Shift.''
 As for the stock market, it really can't handle much more bad news. Yet Charles R. Morris, a writer steeped in the details of the derivatives and credit default swaps that have caused so much trouble, believes that there are plenty more write-downs yet to come -- and that the era that began in August 1982, when the bull market began in earnest, is winding down. ''I view this as an end to a 25-year cycle,'' he told me. He's titled his new book ''The Trillion-Dollar Meltdown.''
 I don't claim to know where the stock market is going in the near term. Nobody with a brain can claim to know that. What I do know is that the events of this week -- and the past few months -- have served as a painful reminder of how dependent we have become on a rising stock market and an ever-appreciating home. If we ever get back to an era like the one that took place from 1969 to 1982, it's not going to be fun. It's not just that we were younger back then. America was a different place, and Americans didn't need the stock market, or home appreciation, to live the way they wanted. 
 Now we do. Let's see what happens on Monday.

HEADLINE: Britain Looks for Its Essence, And Finds Mostly Punch Lines

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
It was a lofty idea: formulate a British ''statement of values'' defining what it means to be British, much the way a document like the Declaration of Independence sets out the ideals that help explain what it means to be American. 
 Because of the peculiarities of its long history, Britain has in modern times never felt the need for such a statement. But in an era of decentralized government and citizens who tend to define themselves less by their similarities than by differences of region, ethnicity or religion, the government felt that the time was ripe for one. 
 The proposal, part of a package of British-pride-bolstering measures announced by Prime Minister Gordon Brown's new government over the summer, raised a host of tricky questions. What does it mean to be British? How do you express it in a country that believes self-promotion to be embarrassing? And how do you deal with a defining trait of the people you are trying to define: their habit of making fun of worthy government proposals? 
 Detractors spread the rumor that the government was looking not for a considered statement, but for a snappy, pithy ''liberte, egalite, fraternite''-style slogan that it could plaster across government buildings in a kind of branding exercise. 
 Nor did it help when The Times of London cynically sponsored a British motto-writing contest for its readers. 
 The readers' suggestions included ''Dipso, Fatso, Bingo, Asbo, Tesco'' (Asbo stands for ''anti-social behavior order,'' a law-enforcement tool, while Tesco is a ubiquitous supermarket chain); ''Once Mighty Empire, Slightly Used''; ''At Least We're Not French''; and ''We Apologize for the Inconvenience.'' The winner, favored by 20.9 percent of the readers, was ''No Motto Please, We're British.'' 
 ''The point I was making is, this idea of a statement of Britishness; I cannot think of anything less British than that,'' said 25-year-old David Bishop, author of the winning motto. 
 In the House of Lords, there was a surreal debate on the nonmotto, even after Lord Hunt of Kings Heath, an official in the Ministry of Justice, said flatly that there were no plans to have one. 
 ''I do not think I will go down that route,'' he said. ''But I will say that the motto of Birmingham City Football Club is 'Keep right on 'til the end of the road.' '' 
 The Earl of Mar and Kellie then suggested that the British could use the Scottish motto ''Nemo me impune lacessit,'' which he translated from the Latin as ''Do not sit on a thistle.'' (Actually, it means ''no one attacks me with impunity.'') Lord Faulkner of Worcester offered ''Play up, and play the game,'' a line from a Victorian-era poem comparing conduct on the battlefield to conduct on the cricket field. And Earl Ferrers said that if it proved too difficult to come up with a British-wide motto, the House of Lords could perhaps use its own: ''Questions and answers ought to be short.'' 
 Part of the trouble with the whole exercise is that Britain never really began as a country, but rather ''just evolved endlessly through time,'' said Vernon Bogdanor, a professor of government at Oxford. 
 ''In the past, Britain was something that just happened,'' he said. ''You didn't have to think about it. No one's ever sat down and thought about what it means to be British.'' 
 On the contrary, said Michael Wills, the Ministry of Justice official in charge of the statement-of-values exercise. ''It's absolute historical nonsense,'' he said in an interview. ''There's been an intense preoccupation with what it means to be British from the 17th century onwards.'' After a long period of post-imperial transition, economic decline and loss of heart in the second half of the last century, he said, Britain has a new confidence and robustness and is ready to say so. 
 ''People are proud of being British,'' he said. ''When you ask people, 'What does it mean to be British?' they want to talk about it.'' 
 The government's plans also include coming up with a definition of British citizenship; formulating a ''bill of rights and duties'' for citizens; and even considering writing down a constitution (it is currently unwritten, an accrual of precedents). There is also talk of a ''British Day,'' similar to Independence Day; a ''museum of Britishness''; and a revisiting of the national anthem, ''God Save the Queen,'' one of whose later verses advocates annihilating the ''rebellious Scots,'' which is not very nice to the Scottish. 
 The Scottish, who were empowered by the Labor Party to set up their own Parliament and take more control of their destiny, are feeling particularly un-British these days and in any case have never really liked the song. 
 ''It's surprising that it's taken them 250 years to realize that it's not inclusive,'' Brian Adam, a member of the Scottish Parliament, said last month. ''I personally am more happy with 'Flower of Scotland.' ''
 The historian Tristram Hunt said that such grand gestures would not sit easily with many Britons, anyway. ''I personally think it's based on a misreading of the British character,'' he said. ''Part of the attraction of Britain is the space it gives people to pursue their own agendas and identities.'' 
 In advocating the proposals, Prime Minister Brown, a Scot himself, has been influenced by the United States, with its melting-pot philosophy and strong sense of national identity, and by the ideas of Sir Jonathan Sacks, the chief rabbi of Britain. Sir Jonathan believes that while Britain was once like a country house -- everyone was a guest, and everyone felt a sense of belonging -- now people are treating it like a hotel, checking in and out and hunting for bargains. Instead, he has said, it should be a community that people build together. 
 As for the statement of values, Mr. Wills of the Justice Ministry said that the government would soon hold ''an extensive and intensive'' period of consultation with regular people on what being British means to them. After that, it will convene a ''citizens' summit'' of 500 to 1,000 people who will deliberate on the matter. The final decision on the statement will be made by Parliament. 
 But the government has its work cut out for it, if the sort-of debate in the House of Lords is anything to go by. 
 After Lord Hunt's assurances that the government had no plans for a motto and his colleagues' insistence on discussing one anyway, Lord Conwy had a thought. Why, he asked, could they not just use the French ''Dieu et mon droit,'' which means ''God and my right?''
 Lord Hunt replied: ''As the noble lord will know, that represents the divine right of kings. While it is of course a well-known phrase, one would need to reflect on whether that would be entirely relevant to a motto that we are not going to have.''

HEADLINE: Elite Prep Schools, College-Size Endowments

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT. 
Geraldine Fabrikant reported from Exeter, N.H., with updated reporting in New York.

DATELINE: EXETER, N.H. 

 BODY:
When Curtis Thomas, a 14-year-old from a poor family living in St. Rose, La., arrived here two years ago to attend Phillips Exeter Academy, he brought little more than a pair of jeans and two shirts. That would hardly do at a 227-year-old prep school where ties are still required for boys in class.
 So Curtis's history teacher, armed with Exeter funds, took him shopping for a new wardrobe. 
 That outlay was just a tiny fraction of what Exeter spends on its students. With its small classes, computers for students receiving financial aid, lavish sports facilities and more, Exeter devotes an average of $63,500 annually to house and educate each of its 1,000 students. That is far more than the Thomas family could ever afford and well above even the $36,500 in tuition, room and board Exeter charges those paying full price. 
 As a result, like the best universities to which most of its students aspire, Exeter is relying more and more on its lush endowment to fill the gap.
 Despite Exeter's expanding commitments, which include a new promise to pay the full cost for any student whose family income is less than $75,000, the school's endowment keeps growing. Last year -- fueled by gifts from wealthy alumni and its own successful investments -- it crossed the $1 billion mark, up from just over $500 million in 2002. 
 Exeter may be a particularly successful example, but its ballooning endowment also reflects a broader trend. In the 10 years through the 2005-6 academic year, the number of students at independent schools, which does not count parochial schools, rose just 11.6 percent, according to the National Association of Independent Schools. Over the same period, the average endowment per student, adjusted for inflation, increased by 93.5 percent.
 At the nation's richest colleges and universities, endowments are now coming under increased scrutiny. On Thursday, the Senate Finance Committee, concerned about the rising cost of higher education, requested data from the nation's wealthiest colleges on several issues, including how they spend their endowments. Prep schools were not included in the request, but some of the wealthiest are conscious of the issue. 
 Endowments have soared because ''there has been a lot of easy money,'' said Thomas Hudnut, president of Harvard-Westlake School, an independent day school in Los Angeles. ''The stock market, until recently, was very bullish, and people were seeing tremendous run-ups in their real estate equity. It has been a climate favorable to making money and to giving money away.''
 Even as many private schools have done more to provide scholarships to poor and middle-income students, the advantages they enjoy over public schools have widened. To some experts, it is but another indication of America's growing wealth disparity.
 ''Having a big endowment permits all the wonderful touches: computers in the classroom, trips, enriched curriculum,'' said Susan Fuhrman, president of the Teachers College of Columbia University. Students at many private schools ''get a much richer array of opportunities than most public schools can afford.''
 Average expenditures per student for public schools, not adjusted for inflation, rose 28 percent, to $8,809, between the 1999 and 2004 fiscal years, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. 
 That compares with a 40 percent increase, to $20,233, for independent secondary day schools, and a 42.8 percent increase, to $14,300, for each elementary student at day schools. Spending by boarding schools rose 24 percent, to $37,566, in the five years that ended June 30, 2005.
 The independent schools may be well financed, but even middle-class families today often cannot afford the tuition.
 Over a recent breakfast in Exeter's cafeteria, Tyler C. Tingley, Exeter's principal, said the school had commissioned a report showing that in 1980, 40 percent of American families could afford to pay tuition at Phillips Exeter, but by 2004 that number had declined to just 6 percent.
 The ability of Exeter and other wealthy institutions to underwrite students helps explain why they may enjoy an advantage over other independent schools in competing for the best students. 
 ''There is so much money out there and the schools want to take advantage,'' said Sandra Bass, editor of Private School Insider, which tracks New York private schools. ''Every private school is looking for a competitive edge so they can attract the top tier of kids.''
 Exeter now has nearly $1 million in endowment assets for each of its students. Stunningly, that is about 60 percent of what Harvard, with its $34.9 billion endowment, holds for each of its 20,000 undergraduate and graduate students.
 According to the most recent statistics, Exeter, which a year ago held $800,000 per student, was already among the 25 richest private schools in endowment per student, measured not just against other prep schools but also against universities and colleges. A growing number of endowments at the nation's independent schools have become so big that trustees have hired full-time money managers, sometimes alumni, to manage their money. 
 Generally the older, best-known schools have the largest endowments. Phillips Exeter, founded in 1781, is the nation's third-oldest school after Governor's Academy in Byfield, Mass., and Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., which now has $800 million. Choate's endowment has reached $267 million.
 But some day schools, where endowments are generally far lower, are doing very well, too. The Westminster Schools in Atlanta have over $239 million in their coffers and the Brearley School in Manhattan has $100 million.
 ''Today, capital campaigns at New York's private schools are likely to aim at $50 million,'' Ms. Bass said. ''That is almost the ground floor.''
 Indeed, fund-raisers at both day and boarding schools find that graduates feel more loyalty toward their secondary schools than to their colleges. 
 ''I always tell people I was educated at Exeter and went to Yale,'' said James H. Ottaway Jr., a former board member of Dow Jones & Company, whose most recent gift to Exeter was $10 million for its scholarship fund. ''I have always given more money to Exeter because I felt it was the most educational experience and character-forming experience of my life.''
 Most private schools, of course, are not so rich. Of the 179 independent schools for which Commonfund, an investment group, manages money, 73 percent have endowments under $50 million. 
 But some prep schools can seem as luxurious as the nation's top universities. Exeter's 619-acre campus boasts two swimming pools, two hockey rinks, the largest secondary school library in the world, a cafeteria with made-to-order omelets for breakfast and classes with a typical student-teacher ratio of no more than 12 to one. 
 Andover has a world-class art gallery; Lawrenceville, near Princeton, N.J., has its own nine-hole golf course.
 Taking their cue from the ever-wealthier independent schools, some public schools are turning to their own fund-raising. 
 ''Today some public schools are starting campaigns to raise endowment funds,'' Ms. Fuhrman of Teachers College said, ''because they want their children to have the extras that such funding permits.''
 Through scholarships and a greater effort to diversify student bodies, independent schools are sharing their wealth more widely. But access to the best schools remains limited to a relatively tiny group that qualifies on the basis of educational attainment, which is still largely shaped by family background.
 A little more than half of the students at Exeter, for example, pay the full tuition and other charges. And roughly 13 percent of the students are ''legacies,'' the children or grandchildren of alumni. 
 Exeter's effort to broaden the economic diversity of its classes was partly prompted by its research showing that the middle class was being squeezed out of private education.
 ''If your selection pool is only 6 percent of the population,'' Mr. Tingley, the principal, said, ''that is a small percent to draw from. We are trying to create a level playing field. It used to be that we gave financial aid to 34 percent of the student body. Now it is 46 percent. We anticipate it will increase further as a result of the changes.'' 
 Less-wealthy schools are trying to keep up. Sarah Daignault, chairwoman of the investment committee at the Madeira School, a girls' prep school in McLean, Va., said her school allocates 11 percent of its $18 million operating budget to financial aid, which she feels is too little. ''It is important that our student body be diverse because today's kid is going to function in a very diverse world,'' she said.
 Whatever the motivation to spread the wealth, boarding schools are leading the way. Last year 40.9 percent of all boarding school students got some financial aid, compared with 22.5 percent in 2000, according to the National Association of Independent Schools, which tracks 1,300 schools. The number of students getting aid in day schools, attended by 85 percent of the nearly 500,000 students at independent schools, rose just three percentage points, to 17.2 percent, in that period.
 And for all the talk of financial aid, much of the fund-raising across the country is still for buildings and sports programs that help attract students accustomed to comfortable surroundings.
 ''Private school is a luxury, and rich families want the best facilities,'' said Michael Gary, director of admissions at Exeter. ''All too often fund-raising is about the buildings and the sports facilities. The schools need them to attract the wealthy families. They don't have high on their priorities providing access to kids who can't afford it.''

CORRECTION-DATE: February 6, 2008

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article last Saturday about the growing endowments of college preparatory schools referred incorrectly to the rankings by age of college preparatory schools in the United States. Phillips Exeter Academy in Exeter, N.H., founded in 1781, is the sixth-oldest boarding school, not the third-oldest school over all, including day schools. Older boarding schools are West Nottingham Academy in Colora, Md. (1744); Linden Hall in Lititz, Pa. (1746); the Governor's Academy in Byfield, Mass. (1763); Salem Academy in Winston-Salem, N.C. (1772); and Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass. (1781). Older day schools include the Collegiate School in New York City (1628), Roxbury Latin School in Boston (1645) and Hopkins in New Haven (1660). The article also gave an incomplete name for a boarding school in Wallingford, Conn. It is Choate Rosemary Hall, not just Choate.

And Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., was founded in 1778, not 1781. An accompanying article about prep schools' hiring of professionals to invest endowments and run capital campaigns misstated the given name and the surname of a New York consultant who helped the Children's School in Stamford, Conn., raise $7 million. He is Timothy L. Hogen, not Tom Hogan.

HEADLINE: Out of Favor for Benefiting From Favors, Rowland Stirs Varied Sentiments

BYLINE: By ALISON LEIGH COWAN

DATELINE: STAMFORD, Conn. 

 BODY:
The job description may be less impressive than governor or congressman, but John G. Rowland is raring to go.
 Others, however, are not nearly so eager for him to do so.
 The man whose boundless political career came crashing down in 2004 when he resigned as governor of Connecticut and pleaded guilty to enriching himself at taxpayer expense is about to resume his career -- after serving time in prison -- as a well-paid public servant.
 The Democratic mayor of Waterbury and a business group are prepared to anoint Mr. Rowland, the former three-time Republican governor and a Waterbury native, as the economic development chief for Greater Waterbury. Although details are still being worked out, the mayor and officials of the business group say the newly created job will pay $90,000 to $120,000 a year, not counting expenses, and they insist they will be getting their money's worth. 
 ''As far as we're concerned, he deserves a second chance, and we can think of no one better to drive economic development from the private sector than John Rowland,'' said Stephen R. Sasala II, the president of the Chamber of Commerce here. 
 The all-is-forgiven offer should not come as a total shock. People here still call Mr. Rowland ''the governor,'' and the local newspaper embraced him long after his own Republican Party called for him to resign or be impeached.
 Still, the notion of turning to Mr. Rowland, the man who helped give Connecticut the nickname Corrupticut, appalls some. ''It's like hiring an arsonist as fire chief,'' said Steven P. Santovasi, a city employee who is chairman of the Waterbury Coalition of Municipal Unions. 
 Mr. Santovasi and others are not sure why officials here needed to engage a former felon, still on probation and legally bound to notify the probation office before traveling, to be their pitchman. 
 ''Aren't there any better candidates?'' asked Martin C. Lippe, a former Internal Revenue Service agent who advised the panel that examined Mr. Rowland for impeachable offenses. ''There's a certain taint that's there.'' 
 Mr. Rowland, who now lives in Middlebury, did not return phone calls seeking comment, but he told reporters he was excited by the opportunity.
 Known as the Brass City because of its once vibrant manufacturing sector, Waterbury, a working-class city of 107,300, has something of an inferiority complex. Its finances required state oversight until a year ago, and the city is known as much these days for tarnish as brass.
 Two former mayors have gone to prison, one for taking bribes and another for molesting young girls. Deals Mr. Rowland's administration entered into with friends from Waterbury, including several that involved economic development, provided fodder for the federal criminal investigation and the impeachment inquiry that eventually forced him from office.
 So the idea that Mr. Rowland can now revitalize the city is, depending on who is asked, either inspiration or madness. 
 In his heyday, voters appreciated Mr. Rowland, who was always well dressed, quick with the quip and ready to cut a deal. Showered with things like free country club memberships, concert tickets and a hot tub, he lived well after moving to the governor's mansion in 1995. But it was that endless feast of favors that was his undoing. 
 Opponents say they fear that the new job will present similar temptations. ''You want to believe that people learn from their mistakes,'' said State Representative Arthur J. O'Neill, a Republican. ''The problem he got into was people would give him things and then he would do things to benefit them.''
 For his part, Mr. Santovasi said it was unfair for the city to tailor a well-paying job for Mr. Rowland when others seeking a second chance have trouble getting hired. He gave the example of the son of a co-worker who had applied to be a city plumber and disclosed that he had served time in prison, only to be turned away. ''If you're a convicted felon, they don't hire you,'' he said. 
 But Mayor Michael J. Jarjura, who champions hiring Mr. Rowland, said a conviction would not automatically bar an applicant from employment. Moreover, he said, the former governor would be an employee of the Chamber of Commerce, a nonprofit organization, and not the city.
 Financially, the job would be a big lift for Mr. Rowland, who has given motivational speeches since leaving prison in 2006 but has not had regular employment despite the condition in his probation that he ''obtain and maintain full employment.''
 Despite a statement Mr. Rowland made to The Associated Press that his salary would not come from ''public money,'' the mayor and Mr. Sasala explained the other day that only some of his salary would come from the Chamber of Commerce, which collects dues from 1,000 businesses. Additional funds would come from diverting some of the $450,000 that City Hall gives the Waterbury Development Corporation to promote the city. 
 ''It's a public-private partnership,'' Mayor Jarjura said, apologizing for Mr. Rowland's misunderstanding. ''He probably did not realize,'' he said.
 Some chamber members, bewildered as to why the mayor would stick his neck out for a disgraced Republican, had apparently not done their homework. When Mr. Jarjura faced a crowded primary in his first run for mayor in 2001, he got a cross-party endorsement from Mr. Rowland, then the governor. 
 Still, Mr. Jarjura said that the episode had nothing to do with his backing Mr. Rowland now. 
 ''If I didn't believe in my core that this will be good for advancing the interests of Waterbury, that's the only reason I'm doing this,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Building Costs Deal Heavy Blow to Local Budgets

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

DATELINE: SEATTLE 

 BODY:
State and local governments in many parts of the country are struggling to pay for roads, bridges and other building projects because of rising construction costs, adding another burden to budgets already stressed by the troubled housing market.
 The problems have come as many governments pursue ambitious projects to improve roads and airports, build schools and upgrade long-neglected water and sewer systems. Many of the projects were conceived when money from property, sales and income taxes was steady and interest rates low, but officials say the ground has shifted beneath their feet. 
 ''Everybody's scared,'' said Uche Udemezue, director of engineering and transportation for San Leandro, Calif., which will soon put out a request for construction bids on a retiree center and a parking garage. ''You don't know what you're going to find when you go out to bid.''
 Costs have jumped for projects as varied as levee construction in New Orleans, Everglades restoration in Florida and huge sewer system upgrades in Atlanta. The reconstruction of the Interstate 35W bridge in Minneapolis, a $234 million project, has been fast-tracked for completion by December, and state officials say it is too soon to know whether it will come in on budget. 
 The impact has been felt in different regions at different times, and not every project has been high-profile. In Oregon, high costs have forced the State Department of Transportation to slow the rate at which it upgrades roads and bridges. In Seattle, school building projects were put on a fast track this fall because of fears of cost overruns.
 ''We escalated our project schedule to get ahead,'' said Fred Stephens, director of facilities and construction for Seattle Public Schools.
 Nationwide, increasing costs first became a problem for some projects more than two years ago, and in some regions the rate of increase has dropped in the past year. But some regions are tighter than ever, and the pressure from the high costs can be more acute in the context of general revenue declines. 
 The list of culprits for the increases often depends on the rate of growth and construction in a particular region, with labor costs playing a role along with the rising prices of materials like steel and concrete, and asphalt, fuel and other petroleum-based products. 
 Experts say high costs are linked to competition from a global development boom, particularly in China and India; the housing boom in the United States; and the rush to rebuild after Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and other recent hurricanes that struck Florida and the Southeast. In the Northwest, public projects have competed with downtown construction surges in Seattle and Portland. Just across the Canadian border, hotels and highways are being built to prepare for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver.
 The costs have added to what has become an increasingly bleak economic forecast for many states and local governments. At least 25 states expect to have budget deficits in 2009, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, which estimates the combined budget shortfall for 17 of the states at $31 billion or more. Many cities, too, see difficult times ahead as revenues wane and costs increase for wages, pensions and health care.
 ''We're talking about all levels of government being in some revenue constraints at a time when the service costs aren't going down,'' said Chris Hoene, the director of policy and research for the National League of Cities.
 In some places, the news is not all bad. Recent declines in residential construction are beginning to force contractors to be more competitive when they bid for government work. Yet some government officials see that as a dubious silver lining.
 In Oregon, low bids for recent bridge projects came in at $18 million, about 10 percent below what the state had projected. That was unimaginable a year ago, but the relief is relative, said Tom Lauer, the major projects manager for the Transportation Department.
 ''We've been getting hit so hard that we've been pumping them up the last couple of years,'' Mr. Lauer said of the state's internal cost projections. 
 ''I didn't get a price break,'' he said of the recent bid. ''I may just have more predictable pricing. I still can't afford to do other stuff.''
 In Newcastle, a growing Seattle suburb, the situation is emblematic of the struggles confronting towns and school districts across the country. Two main goals prompted the improvements now under way on a main thoroughfare, Coal Creek Parkway. Widening a bottleneck on the road would help relieve congestion on nearby Interstate 405. And doing it with style -- using steel on a bridge to evoke an old train trestle and installing landscaped medians between lanes -- would send the signal that Newcastle is ready to do business.
 Then the bids came back. ''Slack-jawed,'' said John Starbard, the city manager, when asked his reaction to the bids.
 Mr. Starbard said even the project's engineering consultant, CH2M Hill, was stunned when what they believed was a very conservative $38 million estimate in March 2007 was met with a low bid of more than $44 million for a mile's worth of road and bridge improvements.
 But waiting to build was not an option. The city had already received help from Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, and state lawmakers, as well as the State Transportation Improvement Board. It went back to the board and received $2 million more. 
 ''It was a shared sticker shock, but they had seen this with other projects so they were not as surprised,'' Mr. Starbard said of the board.
 In Newton, Mass., a Boston suburb with a population of more than 80,000, the estimate for the new Newton North High School was $104 million in 2004. Four years later, the foundation is about to be poured and the estimate is now at least $186 million, said Jeremy Solomon, a city spokesman. Mr. Solomon said about $25 million of the increase involved changes to the original plan, for asbestos abatement, adjustments to the heating and air-conditioning system and other factors. Otherwise, he said, the increase resulted from rising building costs.
 ''We kind of got caught in a period where construction costs grew rapidly,'' said Mr. Solomon, citing steel and fuel costs, among others. 
 The need for public improvements only grows greater. Costs are rising even as engineers across the country say infrastructure is rapidly decaying.
 In San Leandro, a city of 78,000 in the San Francisco Bay Area, Mr. Udemezue said the city could not afford to delay work on the parking garage and retiree center.
 ''We can't wait,'' he said, ''because we don't know if the prices are going to come down or go up.''
 In the grading guide known as the Pavement Condition Index, zero is not far from a dirt strip and 100 is a fresh new roadway. When Mr. Udemezue began working for San Leandro 16 years ago, the average road ranking in the city was nearly 70. Now it is closer to 60, despite what Mr. Udemezue said were the city's efforts to keep up maintenance.
 Years ago, there was more money in the city's general revenue stream that could be diverted to help with basic maintenance, which Mr. Udemezue said required about $5 million a year. 
 That general revenue now goes to other needs, like public safety, and the roads go wanting, with flat revenue from gas taxes and other declines leaving about $1.2 million to maintain roads each year. The $13 million retiree center and the $8 million parking garage have been affected, too, with the city dropping plans to build commercial space beneath the garage and reducing the space for social programs in the center.
 Mr. Udemezue and others say they have heard that things may be stabilizing, but they cannot be sure.
 Even in places where the rise of costs has slowed, said Ken Simonson, chief economist with the Associated General Contractors of America, ''it's dormant at best.''

HEADLINE: Where Would the 12 Million Go?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 ''One Argument, 12 Million Holes'' (editorial, Jan. 18), about immigration, does not discuss the enforcement paradox that brought us to the current crisis.
 For decades, migrant workers came north for several months each year to harvest seasonal crops, sending their wages home to their families. In the off-season, they returned home, only to venture north again the following year, crossing the border illegally but unmolested.
 Our ballooning population of permanent illegal immigrants is, to a great extent, the unintended legacy of the Clinton administration's strict border policy, which represented a departure from decades of relatively lax enforcement. Migrant workers who could no longer afford to risk semiannual border crossings brought their families north to settle here once and for all. 
 Vain proposals to ''close'' the border are worse than insufficient. They would increase the scale of the problem.
 Mike Leonard Stockbridge, Mass., Jan. 18, 2008
 To the Editor:
 If workplace enforcement was carried out effectively, perhaps the 12 million illegal immigrants living in the United States would not have to be deported, but would return home by themselves. (This could happen if employers faced jail rather than a slap on the wrist.)
 It is much better to be unemployed at home and with family than unemployed, illegal and unwelcome in a foreign country. 
 As an immigrant myself, I am all for immigration, but in a rational and orderly way. 
 Ernest Seinfeld Jupiter, Fla., Jan. 18, 2008
 To the Editor:
 A better way to define the immigration problem is to consider the damage it does to the home countries. We are essentially stripping these countries of their most vital resource, their most eager-for-work citizens.
 If the United States freely issued work visas, made depositing in home banking accounts easy, and travel back and forth legal, more immigrants might return home voluntarily, strengthening their own countries' economies and making future immigration less likely.
 Carter Tomassi Berkeley, Calif., Jan. 18, 2008
 To the Editor:
 For many people, including the illegal immigrants in limbo and the even greater number of Americans in an uproar, the cacophony of the Republican candidates vying for the greatest volume with their anti-illegal immigration rhetoric is not only unproductive; it's also misleading and needlessly prolongs an untenable situation.
 None of the Republican presidential candidates can, like some biblical protagonist, exile an estimated 12 million people from the promised land through attrition or mass deportation. Senator John McCain deserves praise for risking his candidacy to cross borders and mend fences both within and without his party.
 As your editorial states, the Democrats have largely treaded the issue with ''eggshell timidity.'' They should realize that the immigration eggshell has already shattered.
 Wayne Trujillo Denver, Jan. 18, 2008
 To the Editor:
 ''Fearing Deportation but Clinging to Life and Homes in U.S.'' (news article, Jan. 18) doesn't mention the negative effects illegal immigration has on Americans and legal immigrants. Despite repeatedly stating that illegal immigrants pay taxes, the article ignores the fact that they are a burden on American taxpayers.
 The Heritage Foundation reports that the average low-skilled immigrant household receives $30,160 in government benefits but pays only $10,573 in taxes. So each low-skilled immigrant household costs taxpayers $19,587 per household per year. 
 Illegal immigrants take jobs away from Americans and legal residents. The Center for Immigration Studies estimates that low-skilled American workers lose an average of $1,800 a year because of competition from low-skilled immigrants for their jobs. And illegal immigration also leads to overcrowded schools and hospitals. 
 Illegal immigrants are responsible for their own criminal actions and should not blame law enforcement officials for the fact that they are subject to deportation.

HEADLINE: Fiscal Mantra For McCain: Less Is More

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT

DATELINE: WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. 

 BODY:
Senator John McCain said that, if elected, he would do what other presidents had tried but failed to do: cut government spending sharply enough to reduce the budget deficit while lowering taxes at the same time.
 In an interview outlining his economic approach, Mr. McCain emphasized his experience working on economic matters in Congress and laid out an unorthodox version of conservatism. After initially opposing President Bush's tax cuts, he has become a supporter of making them permanent and of pursuing additional tax reductions, saying they are the best way to encourage economic growth. 
 But unlike Mr. Bush -- or other Republican presidential candidates this year -- Mr. McCain favors government mandates to halt global warming and slow the growth of Medicare costs. His campaign says it would also cut financing for programs that the White House budget office has deemed ineffective, a list that includes Amtrak.
 Speaking at a law office here on Thursday, shortly after holding a fund-raiser in the reception area, Mr. McCain, of Arizona, offered warm praise for Alan Greenspan, the former Federal Reserve chairman. But he said it was unclear whether Ben S. Bernanke, the current chairman, was adequately handling the present slowdown. 
 ''Depending on the depth of this crisis that we're in, we'll find out whether he acted soon enough and whether he acted appropriately enough,'' Mr. McCain said. ''I don't think it's clear yet.''
 He also said that he would consider resuscitating the work of a bipartisan tax-reform commission, appointed by Mr. Bush, whose 2005 report on simplifying the tax code was largely ignored by the administration. Using the process that has been used to close military bases, Mr. McCain said he would ask Congress to vote yes or no on an entire tax-simplification program.
 With recession fears mounting, Republican candidates have increasingly focused on the economy in recent weeks. This presents challenges for Mr. McCain, who has already angered some primary voters with his stances on immigration, global warming and campaign finance. Likewise, he has angered some conservatives by changing his position over the years on tax cuts.
 Mr. McCain has joked on previous occasions about his lack of economic expertise. And in a debate earlier this month, he said that he would stimulate the economy by cutting government spending, a move that economists say would have the opposite effect.
 ''The issue of economics is not something I've understood as well as I should,'' he said last month, according to The Boston Globe. ''I've got Greenspan's book.''
 Recently, though, he has stopped making self-deprecating comments about his background and instead emphasized his role in helping to cut taxes and spending as ''a foot soldier in the Reagan revolution.'' Noting that he also later ran the Senate Commerce Committee, Mr. McCain said in the interview that he would feel no need to select a vice president with expertise in economic policy to balance his own foreign-policy experience. 
 He also pointed to a recent Wall Street Journal survey of economists, many of them from Wall Street firms, which found that he was easily their top choice for president. ''I don't need any extra help,'' he said.
 Mr. McCain described himself as being in the mold of Theodore Roosevelt, as a ''free-enterprise, capitalist, full-bore guy'' who nonetheless believes that the economy depends on government institutions ''that need to do their job as well.''
 Mr. McCain begins the story of his economic education in 1982, when the country was in recession and he was first elected to the House. 
 Once in Congress, he worked with Jack F. Kemp and Phil Gramm, two conservatives who were also in the House then, and Martin Feldstein, a Harvard economist who was an aide to President Ronald Reagan, to pass tax cuts and spending restraints. Mr. McCain said that Mr. Gramm -- ''a guy who taught economics for 12 years at Texas A&M'' and who has endorsed Mr. McCain -- had been an especially important mentor. 
 ''Those were my formative years,'' Mr. McCain said. ''We went from those abysmal situations when he came to office in 1981,'' he said, referring to Reagan, ''to a long period of economic growth and prosperity.'' 
 During Reagan's years in office, unemployment and inflation dropped sharply. Tax rates generally fell, as did spending on government programs outside the military. But there were also two significant downsides to the 1980s economy, and Mr. McCain has made an issue of both at different points in his career. The budget deficit soared, because the cuts in domestic spending were not large enough to make up for the Reagan tax cuts and a military buildup. And middle-class incomes grew at a much slower rate than they had in the 1950s or '60s. 
 In the aftermath of his loss to Mr. Bush in the 2000 Republican primaries, Mr. McCain began emphasizing middle-class pocketbook issues. After having consistently voted for tax cuts in the 1980s, he was one of the few Republicans to oppose the administration's tax cuts in 2001 and 2003. He said at the time that they benefited ''the most fortunate among us at the expense of middle-class Americans.'' 
 In the current decade, wage gains for most families have been even weaker than they were in the 1980s, and Mr. McCain has spoken during the campaign about the anxiety being caused by a globalization and technological change. Were he to win the Republican nomination, it is possible he would then put a bigger emphasis on such themes.
 ''Change is hard,'' he said in a speech in Detroit in October, ''and while most of us gain, some industries, companies and workers are forced to struggle with very difficult choices.''
 To spur the economy, Mr. McCain has called for more spending on alternative-energy research. Spending on basic research, he said, could lead to a repeat of the Internet's success story, in which government financing ultimately led to the creation of a huge private industry. He has also called for an expansion of community-college programs and an overhaul of unemployment benefits, to reflect the fact that people who lose their jobs now are often out of work for long periods. 
 Mr. McCain now favors the extension of the Bush income tax cuts, saying that letting them lapse would amount to a tax increase that would damage the economy. He said the Democrats' plans to allow the expiration of the Bush tax cuts for households making at least $250,000 would simply redistribute wealth and lead to an endless fight over who was truly affluent. 
 ''Americans don't dislike wealthy people; they want to be wealthy people,'' he added.
 On several occasions over the last year, Mr. McCain has said that tax cuts can reduce the deficit by spurring additional activity that, in turn, leads to more taxes being paid. But numerous studies have found that not to be the case. 
 In the interview, Mr. McCain said, referring to tax cuts, ''Whether they actually pay for themselves dollar for dollar, obviously there are differences in opinion.''
 During his campaign, Mr. McCain has focused much more on spending than on taxes. He has called for the end of earmarks, which are pet projects inserted into spending bills by legislators. 
 They are ''a very small part of the budget,'' he said, ''but so symbolic'' -- because they prevent politicians from having any credibility when they try to persuade the public about other budget cuts. The campaign has also said Mr. McCain would consider cutting the programs thatthe White House has identified as ineffective, which together make up 10 percent of the budget. The campaign has not specified which ones it would cut. In addition to Amtrak, the list includes various programs dealing with Defense Department communications, veterans' disability and low-income heating assistance.
 He has spoken in detail about reducing Medicare costs, which budget experts say are the biggest long-term fiscal problem. He has proposed changing the way that Medicare reimburses hospitals and doctors so that it stops paying for care that fails to make people healthier. 
 Both Reagan and the current President Bush vowed to cut spending enough to reduce the deficit but failed to do so. Mr. McCain said he believed he could succeed, even if he had not yet explained all of the cuts he would make.
 ''I think the time is ripe for spending restraint,'' he said. ''We can make the case more strongly than ever before, particularly to our Republican base, because they're angry and they're upset and they're dispirited.''

HEADLINE: Congress Moving for Swift Passage of Stimulus

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
House Democrats on Friday said they would try to speed passage of a $150 billion economic stimulus package by scheduling it for a vote on Tuesday, eight days earlier than originally planned.
 The Senate, too, said it would pick up the pace, potentially bringing the bill to the floor on Thursday. 
 Several powerful Senate Democrats have said they want to add components to the plan, including an extension of unemployment benefits and possibly a provision to increase the number of elderly Americans eligible to receive one-time payments of $300, but the new timetable suggested they would have to move rapidly to do so. 
 President Bush, meanwhile, warned the Senate not to complicate the stimulus package. 
 ''Congress should move it quickly,'' Mr. Bush said in a speech to House Republicans who were at an annual retreat at a resort in White Sulphur Springs, W. Va. ''I understand the desire to add provisions from both the right and the left. I strongly believe it would be a mistake to delay or derail this bill.'' 
 The House deal, announced on Thursday by Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr., and the Republican leader, Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, includes tax rebates of up to $600 for individuals and up to $1,200 for couples and, for families, an additional payment of $300 per child. 
 Tax filers who earned at least $3,000 last year but paid less than $300 in income taxes would receive a payment of $300. Elderly Americans living on Social Security who do not have $3,000 in income from other sources would not qualify. 
 The package also includes tax breaks for businesses to encourage investment in new equipment and other spending. 
 Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana and the chairman of the Finance Committee, and other Democrats have criticized the House package, saying it should inject money into the slowing economy more quickly, using such mechanisms as the extension of unemployment benefits and an increase in food stamps. 
 The Treasury Department has said rebate checks could be distributed in May at the earliest. 
 Mr. Baucus, too, planned to work through the weekend as his committee drew up its own stimulus package. Mr. Paulson met on Thursday with Mr. Baucus and Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the ranking Republican on the Finance Committee. 
 Mr. Paulson, who spent much of Wednesday at the Capitol brokering the accord with Ms. Pelosi, returned to the Hill on Friday for a meeting with Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut and the chairman of the Banking Committee. He also spoke again by phone with Mr. Baucus, who held a meeting with Finance Committee members. 
 Other Senate Democrats are pushing for an array of additions to the stimulus package, including infrastructure projects like road resurfacing, and expanded counseling for homeowners to help avoid foreclosures. 
 Senator Maria Cantwell, Democrat of Washington, called for extending clean-energy tax incentives, which she said would spur $7 billion in spending by the wind power industry and create 75,000 jobs in 2008. Senators Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, and Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, pushed for the increase in food stamps. 
 But Ms. Pelosi, in a speech at the National Press Club, pushed back. ''What was being bandied about was a 10 percent increase in food stamps,'' she said. ''Do you know what that translates for a person on food stamps? Ten cents a day. Ten cents a day. I thought it was more important to put a check for $1,000 in the hands of the mom of that family.'' 
 Mr. Boehner also urged the Senate to show restraint, saying: ''It would be irresponsible for Senate Democrats to load this bill up with pork and other spending. Families and small businesses need help now.'' 
 But Senator Kent Conrad, Democrat of North Dakota, said in a radio interview that the package could be improved. ''The Senate has a role to play here,'' Mr. Conrad said.

HEADLINE: Questions Surround Idea of Privatizing the Lottery

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: ALBANY 

 BODY:
Can New York hit the jackpot by selling its lottery?
 Wall Street certainly thinks so. Ten investment banks that have lobbied state officials believe that the state could reap $25 billion to $45 billion now by agreeing to give up a share of future proceeds from its lottery system for the next three to four decades. 
 Wall Street's pitch is that a private investor would pay the state a premium for a part of the revenues and management control of the operation. Gov. Eliot Spitzer envisions using $4 billion as a systemwide endowment for the state's higher education system, then investing the rest of the money in a diversified fund aimed at yielding the roughly $2 billion now generated annually by the lottery system for kindergarten-through-12th grade education.
 ''We should unlock some of the value of the New York State Lottery, either by taking in private investment or looking at other financing alternatives,'' Mr. Spitzer said in his State of the State address this month. ''As we do this, we will assure that the state continues to regulate all lottery games.'' 
 In essence, a private company, or more likely, a consortium, would be trying to make the state's lottery system more profitable over the next several decades by taking over management from state bureaucrats. To entice the state to go along, the private investors would have to pay a lump sum large enough to be worth the state's trouble. 
 Governors across the country have been tempted by the potential, but there has been criticism of proposals to use lump-sum payments to erase short-term budget gaps. 
 Gov. Jon S. Corzine of New Jersey briefly considered privatizing the lottery to try to erase his state's enormous debt, but instead has recently proposed to increase highway tolls over the next 15 years.
 In Mr. Spitzer's proposal, the fund would be used to create an endowment, not to patch a problem. But it would inevitably be paid for by an expansion of gambling, which the private-sector partners would be expected to seek aggressively. New York's lottery already produces more annual revenue, about $6.8 billion, than any other state in the country. The lottery proposal is part of a broader plan the governor laid out this week to expand gambling, including a proposal to allow the Belmont Park horse track to install 4,500 video slot machines.
 Potential concerns about the lottery plan boil down to two categories: Are state officials willing to accept an expansion of state-sponsored gambling if it helps provide financing for education? And what are the risks of such a deal? That is a question that is hard to answer until more details emerge. 
 ''This is an idea that I would say every major Wall Street firm has come to us and said, 'You really should consider it,' '' said Paul Francis, the governor's operations director and an architect of the budget effort.
 Of course, Wall Street's credibility is not exactly at a high point, especially when it comes to financial engineering. The complex instruments that the major investment banks built around subprime mortgages have blown up in their faces, leading to tens of billions of dollars in losses. This deal appears less complex -- no derivatives involved --but while it has been considered in a number of other states, it has never won legislative approval. 
 Lawmakers are not rallying around the idea, and many are eager to see a more detailed proposal. 
 Sheldon Silver, the Assembly speaker and the Legislature's top Democrat, expressed reservations about both the lottery proposal and the governor's plan to impose a ceiling on local property tax increases, another major source of aid for local school spending. 
 ''In the end, what is it we are actually doing?'' Mr. Silver asked of the lottery proposal. ''Are we tapping funding for K-12? That and tax caps, that's two hits on K-12. Again, I'm not a financial wizard, but the logic of it I'm still trying to figure out.''
 John McArdle, a spokesman for the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, the state's top Republican, said: ''This kind of proposal is being bandied about as a source of revenue, but it's never been attempted. Forgetting whether or not it's a good idea from a public-policy standpoint, there's an awful lot of questions.'' 
 The idea of long-term leases of public assets surfaced in 2005, when Chicago leased its Skyway to a foreign consortium for the next century in exchange for a $1.8 billion payment. The lottery proposal is Wall Street's latest spin on the concept, and other states, including California, Illinois and Florida, have flirted with various approaches. The proposals have ranged from leasing as much as 100 percent of a lottery system to a private company to the more modest step of allowing a private company to have a share of future profits above a certain threshold. 
 ''I think it's far more likely that the state would propose a transaction in which the state retained a very large percentage of the continuing upside of the lottery; whether it was 49 percent, or whether it be 51 percent, that's the kind of thing that would have to be analyzed,'' said Mr. Francis, a former corporate financial officer. 
 The Spitzer administration plans to hire a small investment bank to explore the idea; if the governor decides to go forward, the proposal will need legislative approval. A large investment bank would then be hired to market the deal and structure it, a role that would yield that bank tens of millions of dollars in fees. 
 From the governor's perspective, it is not hard to see the temptation. 
 He has made it a priority to improve the State University of New York, which lacks the endowments of more prominent university systems in states like Texas. But there is little money available. Not only is the economy taking a gloomy turn, but also, the financial industry's recent losses are terrible news for New York. One-fifth of the state's revenue comes from Wall Street through taxes on bonuses, income, capital gains or large real estate transactions. 
 So, in one sense, the governor is turning to Wall Street financial engineering in part to alleviate a problem caused by Wall Street financial engineering. 
 Still, the governor is confident the endowment could generate hundreds of millions of dollars a year for New York's state and city universities and help pay for initiatives like a Spitzer plan to hire 2,000 new professors. 
 ''The finest private and public colleges and universities in America use the funds from permanent endowments to achieve excellence,'' he said in his State of the State address. ''If we are to join their ranks, we must do so as well. Higher education funding should no longer be a budgetary pawn or a yearly battle. It must be a permanent priority.''
 But his plans to pay for it face determined opposition. 
 Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a Westchester Democrat, has been critical of wealthy politicians like Mr. Spitzer, Mr. Corzine and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg for supporting large toll or fee increases -- or potentially increasing gambling operations. 
 ''It's Corzine, it's Bloomberg, it's Spitzer,'' he said. ''They increase user fees and sell off public assets, and the net result is an increased burden on middle-class people who use government systems. The big-business community, and the rich, escape.''

HEADLINE: Heeere's Rudy!

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS

DATELINE: FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. 

 BODY:
 ''As I've pointed out over and over again ...'' Rudy Giuliani said this week at a press conference in a South Florida suburb.
 The great Russell Baker once observed that when a reporter finds himself writing ''Once again this year ...'' it's time to look for a new beat. When a presidential candidate starts confiding to his audience that he could give his speech in his sleep, as Rudy has been doing, it may be time to consider another line of work. 
 Tuesday's Florida primary is supposed to be the Giuliani firewall, his explanation for why he kept coming in third or fourth or fifth everywhere else. Of course he didn't get any votes in Michigan! How could anybody expect him to do well in Iowa? He had to campaign in Florida! 
 After a while, it began to take on the eerie quality of ''The Shining.'' He's only at 15 percent in some of the polls -- could he really have been campaigning here for a month and a half? Cue a picture of the candidate sitting in a basement somewhere, writing ''All work and no play makes Rudy a dull boy'' on the walls. 
 At first, Giuliani's unusual strategy seemed unusual but not entirely irrational. He would win over Florida by proving that he loved it more than any other state, the way John McCain loved New Hampshire and Mitt Romney loved Michigan. But many commentators have pointed out -- really very unkindly -- that the longer Giuliani stayed in Florida, the lower his standing in the state polls. Perhaps it would have been wiser for him to make his stand in a place where people had barely heard of him.
 They say Guam is quite lovely this time of year. 
 ''The reality is we are getting support,'' said the candidate in answer to the inevitable question. He says ''the reality is ...'' very, very often. Almost as often as he says ''very, very.''
 Those of us who live in New York found it rather peculiar that Giuliani was a front-runner at all, given his deeply mixed record running the city. Now, the idea that Florida might take him out of the race is somewhat disappointing. There's still so much about him we haven't yet had a chance to share with the national electorate. Did we ever mention the time he tried to stop the city elections because he didn't think that New York could get along without him?
 Rudy was thrown off his game by the public's shift from worrying about terrorism to worrying about the economy, and a dwindling interest in hearing him talk about where he was when the terrorists attacked New York. He's tried to rebound by vigorously promoting a national catastrophe fund to reduce the cost of home insurance in hurricane-prone Florida. This is not, in general, an idea that fiscal conservatives cotton to. It's so dicey, in fact, that even Mitt Romney has been hesitant about adopting it as a pander-point. 
 Giuliani has turned hurricanes into nature's way of saying Al Qaeda. (''All of us are subject to the impact of natural disasters ... and of course acts of terrorism, which I remember living through.'') 
 Perhaps he can pull it off. Florida is one of those places that makes participating in elections as easy as ordering a drive-thru hamburger. People have been casting their votes for almost two weeks now. Maybe a lot of them voted for Rudy and then were embarrassed to admit it to the pollsters, once they discovered he wasn't really very popular after all.
 Still, his campaign has a definite pall over it, and his many hangers-on have to be wondering whether another pathetic showing here would damage the Rudy brand. Are corporations still going to pay him $100,000 for lecturing about leadership and 9/11 now that they know he's done it for free on the pool deck at the Rosen Centre Hotel in Orlando and Paisano's Gourmet Pizza in Port St. Lucie? (More critically from the minions' perspective, are they still going to provide, as the speaking contract requires, ''first-class travel expenses for up to five people?'') 
 Are they still going to hire his firm, Giuliani Partners, to do whatever it is Giuliani Partners is supposed to do, now that the glow of hanging out with America's Mayor has faded? Before the terrorist attack, after all, Rudy Giuliani was just a lame-duck mayor with abysmal approval ratings, a tabloidy personal life and uncertain job prospects. What 9/11 has given, 1/29 could taketh away. 
 Perhaps that's why he's refrained from saying anything unpleasant about any of his competitors in Florida. Mitt Romney and John McCain are torn between trying to go in for the kill and their desire to avoid looking like Barack and Hillary. The best Rudy can do, on the other hand, might be to avoid looking like a future contender on ''The Celebrity Apprentice.''

HEADLINE: Where Issues Carry Dollar Signs

BYLINE: By SHAILA DEWAN

DATELINE: ORANGEBURG, S.C. 

 BODY:
Officially, the state of South Carolina calls the fancy new building the Orangeburg Workforce Center. Around here, people know it as the unemployment office. And everyone in Orangeburg County, it seems, can tell you how to get there. 
 On Wednesday, Lashon Marshall, a home health care assistant with four children, was paying one of her regular visits to the center, scanning the computer for something that would bring more than the $8 an hour, with no benefits, that she makes after seven years on the job. 
 Ms. Marshall said she was glad to hear the candidates running in Saturday's Democratic presidential primary here talk about helping working people but skeptical that anything would come of it. 
 ''We need somebody in the chair who is going to really just stand up and do what they say they're going to do,'' she said. ''The war, I'm not thinking about too much now. But it seems like more and more people should step up and talk about this health care thing.'' 
 For years, job woes have plagued this blue-collar central South Carolina county, which, like much of the state, has lost its textile and manufacturing economy to cheap overseas labor and is still struggling to find a replacement. But the economic losses have not been equally distributed and have helped to divide the state along racial lines.
 In Orangeburg, unemployment has disproportionately affected blacks, even though, at more than 60 percent of the population, they hold the balance of political power. In 2006, unemployment among blacks here was pushing 20 percent, while among whites it was 3.3 percent. Thirteen percent of white households were below the poverty level, compared with 38 percent of black households. 
 Such dismal statistics have encouraged some voters to listen closely to the candidates' proposals to give tax rebates, fix the trade imbalance and increase the minimum wage. But with the two Democratic front-runners, Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama, in general agreement on many of those issues, some say discontent over the persistent racial divide -- along with anger among some black voters over criticism of Mr. Obama by former President Bill Clinton -- will contribute to race-motivated voting on Saturday. 
 If so, Mr. Obama will have an edge in this primary, the first with a substantial number of African-American voters. Virtually all black voters here are Democrats, while a large majority of whites vote Republican.
 On Thursday, on a dirt road near the small town of Bowman, Townsend Pelzer sat in his truck with his two lap dogs while his beagle chased rabbits in the woods. Mr. Pelzer, 83 and black, a retired maintenance worker for the state highway patrol, said he was going to vote for Mr. Obama.
 Asked why, Mr. Pelzer shrugged, smiled and pointed to his face, saying, ''Color of my skin, I guess.''
 Scott Mattingly, 22, a white economics teacher at a virtually all-white private school in Bowman, said that many of his fellow volunteers at the Obama campaign office were ''ignorant of the issues and are far more excited about the concept of a black leader.'' 
 But Mr. Mattingly added that, in a county where the large businesses are run by white men and ''ancient parochial attitudes'' persist, voter enthusiasm for Mr. Obama had a logic that went beyond simple loyalty. Offering a sort of trickle-down theory of eradicating racism, he said an Obama victory ''would set a precedent that an African-American can lead.''
 Race is far from the only factor voters are considering, however. Bishop Michael C. Butler of Victory Tabernacle, a black Pentecostal church, said he had counseled his congregation to look beyond that issue in the voting booth. Mr. Butler, a Clinton supporter, said most of the members were professionals. 
 ''They're concerned about the stability of their jobs, whether they will be able to maintain the lifestyle that they currently have,'' he said. 
 George R. Dean, 66, who owns a men's clothing store in downtown Orangeburg where all the merchandise is now 50 percent off, said he had watched the battle for civil rights shift into the economic arena. 
 ''This is not the South I grew up in in the '50s and '60s,'' Mr. Dean said. ''The struggle has come, and the struggle has gone. And the struggle has returned.'' 
 Mr. Dean, who is black, added: ''This county grew politically very fast, but we did not grow economically. This has always been my pet peeve. This ain't about democracy, this is about what? Capitalism.''
 Mr. Dean is a board member of the Orangeburg County Development Commission, which has scored some major successes by attracting large businesses specializing in warehouse distribution. The long-term goals -- more jobs, higher pay and a bigger tax base -- will not materialize for three to five years, Mr. Dean said. But, he added emphatically, ''The growth in this area will be diverse.''
 A 2006 study conducted for the commission estimated that while there were about 28,000 people in the area actively looking for work, even more were underemployed. Among them is Ms. Marshall's husband, who works at a lawnmower plant, a seasonal business where production levels change frequently.
 ''Last week they was off, this week they worked, and no telling about next week,'' she said. Health insurance, which her family buys on their own, has edged out salaries as an employment consideration, Ms. Marshall said. 
 ''My cousin works at McDonald's,'' she said. ''She said some people like working there because they get benefits. That's what they go for now.'' 
 Because Orangeburg is a blue county in a red state, it has been visited by all the Democratic candidates, some more than once. Health care, gasoline prices and trade imbalances are all pocketbook issues here. 
 ''I work at a paper mill, but I know a lot of people that have lost their jobs,'' said Larry Rivers, 46. ''I've heard Obama talk about the companies that have taken jobs overseas, saying he was going to stop giving them the tax breaks and start giving tax breaks to the companies that have stayed here.''
 Gilda Cobb-Hunter, a state legislator who represents part of Orangeburg County, said some of the unemployment among blacks stemmed from poor education by the state's money-starved rural schools. The school system was recently portrayed in a documentary about education along Interstate 95 called ''Corridor of Shame,'' a phrase Mr. Obama used in the debate in Myrtle Beach on Monday. 
 ''The issue is education and the effect of a lack of a quality education on the level playing field,'' Ms. Cobb-Hunter said. 
 At the Clinton campaign office in Orangeburg, Sade Willis and her friend Robyn Capers, both black, 21-year-old psychology students at nearby South Carolina State University, assembled lawn signs. ''She's about better pay and education for the kids,'' Ms. Willis said of Mrs. Clinton.
 Ms. Capers added, ''And she has been for 35 years.''
 Ms. Willis, whose mother's job in one of the county's manufacturing plants is at risk of moving overseas, said, ''I know how it is to actually not be able to afford school.''
 Back at the job center, Wilmer Freeman, 59, continued a job search that has been going on for nearly two years, since his position as a purchasing agent was cut at Voorhees College, where he worked for 28 years. Mr. Freeman said he was leaning toward Mr. Obama, or at least his campaign message. 
 ''I don't care what it is, how it is, or how it looks,'' Mr. Freeman said. ''We do need a change.''

HEADLINE: After Break For Debate, Two Rivals Resume Spat

BYLINE: By MICHAEL LUO and JOHN M. BRODER; Michael Luo reported from St. Petersburg, and John M. Broder from Miami. Michael Cooper contributed reporting from Sarasota.

DATELINE: ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. 

 BODY:
A day after a relatively reserved debate in which they appeared to take pains to avoid attacking each other, Senator John McCain and Mitt Romney on Friday engaged in their most vigorous sniping since their back-and-forth before the New Hampshire primary over two weeks ago.
 Mr. McCain dismissed Mr. Romney, a former governor of Massachusetts and a successful business executive, as a mere manager at a time when the American people are looking for a leader. Mr. Romney responded that he had experience in the ''real economy,'' far more useful than ''time on K Street and in Washington, D.C.'' 
 With Florida's primary just four days away, polls indicate the two men are in a tight race for the lead, with Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York and Mike Huckabee of Arkansas farther back. 
 All the candidates are hoping for momentum from a victory heading into the crush of states that hold nominating contests on Feb. 5. Should Mr. McCain win, it could help him secure his status as the Republican front-runner and lay to rest any doubts that he can unite his party around him.
 After his victories in Michigan and Nevada last week, Mr. Romney is looking to win in a heavily-contested state to begin narrowing the race to a two-person contest with Mr. McCain, of Arizona.
 Mr. McCain got an important boost on Friday with the endorsement of Senator Mel Martinez of Florida, who worked closely with him last year on the failed bill that would have created a pathway to citizenship for the nation's 12 million illegal immigrants.
 Mr. Martinez, a Cuban immigrant, indicated as recently as this week that he would probably not endorse anyone. His support should help Mr. McCain with Florida's Cuban-Americans, who play a significant role in the state party.
 Speaking Friday evening in Miami to the Latin Builders Association, a heavily Cuban-American group that Mr. Huckabee, Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Romney addressed earlier in the day, Mr. Martinez said of Mr. McCain, ''Here's a man who 'habla claro' -- he talks straight.''
 It was Mr. McCain who went on the offensive first on Friday, arguing while speaking to reporters aboard his campaign bus in Fort Lauderdale that his experience as chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee dealing with national economic policy issues was better preparation for the presidency than Mr. Romney's years as a financial executive.
 ''Running an investment company is probably a good thing to do,'' Mr. McCain said. ''Making national policy concerning the national economy is probably more beneficial to the nation.''
 He went on: ''Americans want leaders; they don't want managers. I can hire all the managers I need.'' 
 ''I've led,'' he added. ''I've led the largest squadron in the United States Navy. Not for profit, but for patriotism.''
 Moreover, Mr. McCain said, Massachusetts struggled economically during Mr. Romney's tenure as governor.
 Mr. Romney, who helped to found a prominent private equity firm, struck back hard at Mr. McCain on Friday afternoon at a rally attended by several hundred people in Pensacola.
 After vigorously attacking Mr. McCain in television commercials and on the stump in New Hampshire, only to lose the primary there, Mr. Romney had recently been going out of his way to avoid attacking him. 
 ''I guess Senator McCain didn't think as positively of that debate last night as I did,'' Mr. Romney said, ''and so he's had to come back and flail a bit.''
 Mr. Romney mocked Mr. McCain's insistence that time on the Commerce Committee better qualified him. ''I think he's detoured from what was some straight talk,'' he said.
 Seeking to insert himself into the debate despite his slide in the polls, Mr. Giuliani argued at a 9 p.m. event in Sarasota that he was both versed in economic and a leader. 
 ''Floridians deserve someone who has been tested and proven in both areas,'' he said. ''And that's me.''

 HONEYWELL PROFIT RISES Honeywell International reported a 17.8 percent rise in fourth-quarter profit while recording growth in all four of its business segments. The company, based in Morris Township, N.J., said it earned $689 million, or 91 cents a share, for the three months that ended Dec. 31, up from $585 million, or 72 cents a share, a year earlier.
 Fourth-quarter sales gained 12.1 percent, to $9.28 billion, from $8.28 billion in the same period a year ago. The analysts had projected sales of $8.94 billion. (AP)

 Hartford dropped 5.9 percent, to $75.13, after slipping as low as $74.75, the biggest decline since October 2002. Profit excluding investment losses was $2.66 a share, compared with the average $2.50 estimate of 18 analysts compiled by Bloomberg, the company said. (BLOOMBERG NEWS)
 EX-WAL-MART OFFICIAL SPARED Thomas M. Coughlin, the former Wal-Mart executive whose home-detention sentence for stealing from the company was overturned as too lenient, will not be forced to get an independent medical exam before his resentencing next week.
 Judge Robert Dawson of Federal District Court rejected federal prosecutors' request to order the exam. Judge Dawson originally sentenced Mr. Coughlin to 27 months of home detention after defense lawyers argued that his fragile health would make a prison sentence too dangerous. (BLOOMBERG NEWS) INFLATION EASES IN CANADA Despite large increases in energy prices and mortgage costs, Canada's rate of inflation fell to 2.4 percent in December from 2.5 percent the previous month, Statistics Canada said. Much of the decline stemmed from price reductions apparently related to the high value of the Canadian dollar. 
 Sales promotions from auto manufacturers, intended to discourage Canadians from bargain hunting in the United States, translated into a 4.1 percent drop in vehicle prices and leasing costs. IAN AUSTEN

To the Editor:
 Re ''Primary Choices: Hillary Clinton'' (editorial, Jan. 25):
 You endorsed the wrong candidate. You are correct that Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama support similar policies. Yet you seemed to value Mrs. Clinton's ''experience'' more than Mr. Obama's ability to unite a polarized nation. This is a mistake.
 Nothing is more important than re-establishing a strong and wide middle, a place where our common values and common sense can interact to effect the required change. 
 Although Mrs. Clinton may win the presidency, her unfounded attacks on Mr. Obama foreshadow similar tactics in the general election and during her time in office. 
 You endorsed a candidate of divisiveness over a candidate of unity, choosing the short term over the long, and narrow over the broad.
 Kelly Kissock Dayton, Ohio, Jan. 25, 2008
 To the Editor:
 I am disappointed, although not surprised, by your selection of Hillary Rodham Clinton and John McCain as your primary choices. 
 I understand that Mrs. Clinton and Mr. McCain have been around a while (you call it ''experience''), as has The New York Times. I, however, have not. 
 I am a 26-year-old independent-minded progressive voter. I am concerned about the millions of Americans without health care, the continuing global warming, our nation's diminished place in the world and the seemingly endless war in Iraq. 
 I support Senator Barack Obama, a choice that I can understand you lack the foresight (or courage) to make. 
 You may, of course, endorse whomever you wish, and I suspect that your choice will win the Democratic nomination. But when you wake up on the morning after Election Day wondering why all the independent voters chose Mr. McCain and all the young voters stayed home, don't blame us.
 Jesse Laymon Astoria, Queens, Jan. 25, 2008
 To the Editor: 
 You write: ''The potential upside of a great Obama presidency is enticing, but this country faces huge problems, and will no doubt be facing more that we can't foresee. ... Mrs. Clinton is more qualified, right now, to be president.'' 
 It would be unheard of for the board of governors of a corporation to select a chief executive without a proven record of accomplishments. The same holds true when electing a president of a country with more than 300 million people.
 A president is the chief executive of the country. Thus your endorsement of Hillary Clinton is welcomed. That said, Barack Obama has great potential and would be an outstanding asset as a running mate for Senator Clinton should she get the nomination.
 Paul Schoenbaum Williamsburg, Va., Jan. 25, 2008
 To the Editor:
 You did not adequately address my biggest misgiving about Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton: she displays a disturbing willingness to morph her positions to suit the politics of the moment, most notably in her bandwagon vote authorizing the Iraq war. 
 Mrs. Clinton's explanations are grossly unsatisfactory. She is extraordinarily intelligent and knew perfectly well what that vote meant. But she took the easy route anyway.
 True, the issue now is how the war will be ended, but the past is not irrelevant. Ending the war will require somebody willing to do what is painful and unpopular, a president for whom there are higher priorities than being president. That person is not Mrs. Clinton.
 Those of us who support Senator Barack Obama are not merely drawn to some vague, rhetorical message of change. 
 We are drawn to the lucidity and common sense of his concrete ideas, and to the intellectual integrity that shows in their consistency over time. 
 Paul Cantrell Minneapolis, Jan. 25, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Thank you for spelling it out with such crystalline clarity. I'm a liberal Democrat, surrounded by similar others who've been enthusiastic about Senator Barack Obama. I've said repeatedly that he's not ready to be president and leader of the free world. Probably in 10 years, but not now. 
 Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton is tough, strong, smart and a mom. She's been called just about everything, but over time, who a person really is, inside, becomes transparent, no matter what she says or is said about her. 
 Senator Clinton has proved that she is warmhearted, honest and the best qualified over all. She will be able to accomplish the change Senator Obama has been so inspirational about. 
 The United States will be a better place after Mrs. Clinton is president. And she will restore our good standing in the world. I hope someday to see what a more seasoned Mr. Obama will do as president.
 Randall K. Jewell Springboro, Ohio, Jan. 25, 2008
 To the Editor:
 I respectfully disagree with your endorsement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton for the Democratic nomination for president. Simply stated, two families controlling the presidency for 24 to 28 consecutive years would not be in the best interest of this country.
 Senator Barack Obama or former Senator John Edwards would bring new ideas and leadership to the White House. Mrs. Clinton would bring only leadership.
 A fresh start doesn't begin with a former president. The Clintons had their chance and mostly did well, but it's time to move on.
 Mitchell Turker Portland, Ore., Jan. 25, 2008
 To the Editor:
 I believe that your editorial support for John McCain as the Republican primary choice is a serious mistake (''Primary Choices: John McCain,'' editorial, Jan. 25). He supports the most conservative aspects of the Republican right wing. 
 He is in favor of making permanent the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest; he is opposed to women's right to choose; he spoke out against torture of detainees, but quietly retreated when President Bush persisted with unlawful torture. 
 The most serious problem that Mr. McCain would present as president, however, is his determination to continue the war in Iraq until we reach some vague entity that he calls ''victory.'' He is a militarist. As president, he would be a menace, keeping us in an unwinnable, bloody, costly war without end.
 Finally, we need Democratic control of the White House and Congress to undo the damage that President Bush has done to our country. Why should The New York Times endorse any Republican?
 Morton Wachspress Pompton Plains, N.J., Jan. 25, 2008
 To the Editor: 
 Your endorsement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton for nomination as president is supported by the accomplishments, experience and qualifications she offers to the American people.
 She has worked closely in and with local, state and federal government for the last 30 years. She has accomplished legislative and regulatory benefits for business, children, teachers, seniors and workers in many walks of life. Witness the support she has gained from groups representing those populations.
 As a person, she possesses the demeanor, intelligence and personality quite evident through television (and in person) to deal with domestic and foreign officials, leaders and representatives. She is tough, smart and persistent, undistracted by critics and opponents. She knows how to cooperate and make progress. 
 These facts alone make her qualitatively more effective than her opponents -- in either party. 
 William J. Robinson Raleigh, N.C., Jan. 25, 2008
 To the Editor:
 A lifelong Democrat, I was saddened by your endorsement of Hillary Rodham Clinton. The Clintons are using ''scorched earth'' rhetoric to destroy Barack Obama personally and, in the end, destroy a Democratic Party inclusive of all Americans no matter what race, gender, economic level or religion. 
 Barack Obama is reaching out to embrace all Americans, not only African-Americans. He offers hope, new energy and fresh ideas for a better United States. He can bind the wounds of divisiveness and deception that have sent our country into decline at home and abroad. 
 The Clinton machine is willing to win at any price. They seem to forget their earlier moderate political ideas.
 We need a leader who inspires hope, brings innovative ideas and attracts ''the best and the brightest'' to lead this nation, not another divisive leader who continues to divide our nation and our world. Barack Obama is such a leader. Hillary Clinton is not.
 Sharon W. Barnes Alexandria, Va., Jan. 25, 2008
 To the Editor:
 It is as if there is an iceberg dead ahead that we all can see, and you are urging the crew to steer right for it.
 Hillary Rodham Clinton cannot win. To win the presidential election, you need to attract independent voters and some Republicans. Mrs. Clinton repels both. 
 If the Democrats follow your advice, they will lose the general election yet again.
 Michael Ross New Orleans, Jan. 25, 2008
 To the Editor:
 The New York Times's editorial page endorsing a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination is a bit like the Hatfields recommending a leader for the McCoys.

HEADLINE: Around the World, the U.S. Presidential Campaign Is Hitting Home

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL; Reporting was contributed by Heather Timmons and Somini Sengupta from New Delhi; Victor Homola and Nicholas Kulish from Berlin; Katrin Bennhold from Paris; Chieko Tsuneoka from Tokyo; Alexei Barrionuevo from Buenos Aires; Simon Romero from Caracas, Venezuela, and Bogota, Colombia; James C.

DATELINE: DAVOS, Switzerland 

 BODY:
To look at the reams of coverage in newspapers outside the United States or to follow the hours of television news broadcasts, you might conclude that foreigners had a vote in selecting an American presidential candidate -- or, at least, deserved one, so great is America's influence on their lives.
 From Berlin to London to Jakarta, the destinies of Democratic and Republican contenders in Iowa or New Hampshire, or Nevada or South Carolina, have become news in a way that most political commentators cannot recall. It is as if outsiders are pining for change in America as much as some American presidential candidates are promising it. 
 The personalities of the Democratic contest in particular -- the potential harbinger of America's first African-American or female president -- have fascinated outsiders as much as, if not more than, the candidates' policies on Iraq, immigration or global finances. 
 And there is a palpable sense that, while democratic systems seem clunky and uninspiring to voters in many parts of the Western world, America offers a potential model for reinvigoration. 
 ''It is in many ways an uplifting sight to see a great democracy functioning at that most basic of levels,'' said Lord McNally, the leader of the small opposition Liberal Democrats in Britain's House of Lords. ''Even with all the money, the publicity, the power of television, the person who wants to be the most powerful man or woman in the world still has to get down and talk in small town halls and stop people on the street and stand on soapboxes.''
 It was, perhaps, the first upset result in Iowa, with the triumph there of Barack Obama, that electrified interest, closely followed by Hillary Rodham Clinton's victory in New Hampshire.
 In Berlin, newspaper columnists started calling Mr. Obama the ''new John F. Kennedy'' -- no small accolade in a city that reserves a special place for an American leader who, at the height of the cold war, told a divided populace that he, too, was a Berliner. ''The black American has become a new Kennedy,'' proclaimed the tabloid Bild.
 Such was the exuberance that Karsten D. Voigt, the coordinator of German-American cooperation in the German Foreign Ministry, cautioned his compatriots against expecting too much. ''No American president can live up to those expectations in terms of foreign policy,'' he said. 
 In Paris, the fascination with the Clinton-Obama duel seemed to eclipse the Republican contest. ''The Republican candidates are much less well known in France,'' said Alain Frachon, the editor in chief of Le Monde. ''It might be wishful thinking, but the French believe that this Republican era is over.''
 Not only the French. Much of the fervid absorption in the primaries and caucuses -- accessible as never before on 24-hour satellite and cable television channels like CNN and Fox News -- seems inspired by a hope that the American electoral process will end an era of foreign policy dominance by neoconservatives. 
 ''There is a desperate sense of need that there must be something better than Bush out there,'' said Dean Godson, head of a conservative research group in London called Policy Exchange. Or, as Thomas Valasek, a spokesman for the Center for European Reform in London, put it: ''The world at large has a massive stake in the outcome of the elections. Never before has the U.S. had such a terrible reputation, a terrible image.''
 It is, perhaps, too early to guess what specific changes Europeans and other non-Americans expect from a new government. Many of America's Asian trading partners worry about what they see as Democratic proclivities toward economic protectionism and stricter targets on greenhouse gas emissions.
 But there are broader concerns. As Ramesh Thakur, a political science professor in India, wrote: ''We foreigners can but pray that the new president, whoever he or she may be, will return America to its strengths, values and the tradition of exporting hope and other optimism. And so help to lift America and the world up, not tear one another down.'' 
 In Japan, too, there are hopes for American renewal. ''Already the fixed idea, 'Only a white man can become president,' has been broken,'' the newspaper Mainichi Shimbun said Jan. 15. ''We are witnessing the history, the process of grass-roots democracy turning into the U.S. strength.''
 Israelis, for their part, seem to look at the elections through the narrower prism of their own security, and many seem to have concluded that Mrs. Clinton would be the best American president for Israel -- a calculation bolstered by familiarity with her husband. By contrast, said Oz Katz, 29, an Israeli graduate student in public policy, Mr. Obama ''is not really known to us.'' 
 There is deep interest in the campaign in the West African nation of Senegal, fueled in large part by a dislike of President Bush and a hope that a new president will be more open to immigration and less hostile to Islam.
 ''I think President Bush is anti-Islamic,'' said Mouhamed Souleymane Seydi, 24, a hotel-management student at the University of Dakar. ''It's become much harder for Muslims to immigrate to America or even to visit. If you show up at the airport with a beard and look Arab, you're going to come under intense scrutiny.''
 Closer to the United States, in Mexico for instance, attention is focused more on the attitudes of candidates toward immigration controls. ''There is a whole nation of Mexicans living in the United States,'' said Fausto Zapata, a former diplomat in Mexico City. ''And the connections with relatives, friends and partners in Mexico are immense, almost gigantic. Almost any movement in the American economy affects Mexico, negatively or positively.''
 Some outsiders maintain that, for a world seeking a signal of a changed direction in Washington, ''the emblematic victory of Obama would immediately change the image of the United States in the world, particularly in developing countries,'' as Jorge G. Castaneda, the writer and former Mexican foreign minister, put it.
 But there is skepticism in some places that an African-American can actually win the presidency. ''Can he win?'' an Afro-Cuban cabdriver asked an American visitor in Havana. ''I mean, canhe win?'' he asked, wondering if a black man could be elected in a land that Cubans are taught to see as riven with racism.
 Curiosity about Mr. Obama is clearly behind the growing interest in the American vote in Brazil, where many citizens have African roots. Elsewhere in Latin America, expectations seem muted, particularly in Venezuela, where both supporters and foes of President Hugo Chavez seemed to look forward to the end of the Bush administration. ''But we're still aware that no candidate will drastically change relations between Venezuela and the United States,'' said Manuel Sutherland, a representative of the pro-Chavez Bolivarian Association of Socialist Economists.
 In Colombia, one of few places in the world that might have some nostalgia for the Bush era, many people seem drawn to Mr. Obama's bid. ''He would focus more on the needs of immigrants, making him the best candidate for Latinos,'' said Ernesto Rubio, 39, a doctor in Bogota.
 In Asia, the level of interest generally seems lower, though people say they are watching. ''People know the decisions of the American president will affect Indonesia, and that is why many are watching carefully the elections in the United States,'' said Bonar Tidor, 45, a human rights activist in Indonesia.
 But in the Philippines some displayed less concern, even with the Obama-Clinton race. ''In the past we always have two white men talking about strange policies,'' said Alex Magno, 53, a political science professor at the University of the Philippines. ''But probably if they get elected it will be the same as the old white men who contested the elections before.''

PERSON: Richard G. Darman 

HEADLINE: Richard G. Darman, Policy Aide and Deal Maker for 5 Presidents, Is Dead at 64

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
Richard G. Darman, who marshaled a deep, prickly intelligence to guide policy and deal making in four Republican administrations, including negotiating the reversal of the first President George Bush's campaign pledge not to raise taxes, died Friday. He was 64 and lived in McLean, Va.
 His death was announced by James A. Baker III, the former secretary of state and a friend of Mr. Darman. Mr. Darman had been fighting acute myelogenous leukemia, his son Jonathan said. 
 In addition to serving President George Bush in the cabinet-level post of director of the Office of Management and Budget, Mr. Darman worked in six cabinet departments and the White House. He controlled the paper flow to President Ronald Reagan, a pivotal responsibility. 
 Mr. Darman called himself an idealist in the long term, saying he had followed his principles when he resigned with his boss, Attorney General Elliot L. Richardson, during the so-called Saturday Night Massacre of Watergate. In the short term, he was the realist who wheedled a bipartisan Congress to pass Reagan's agenda. As director of the Office of Management and Budget, he negotiated with Congress in 1990 to pass a budget that raised taxes. The deal angered conservatives, who said it violated the pledge that Mr. Bush had made in accepting the Republican presidential nomination: ''Read my lips, no new taxes.'' 
 National Review, the conservative magazine, called Mr. Darman's work ''the most catastrophic budget deal of all time,'' and Mr. Bush himself later said it was the biggest mistake of his presidency. But many economists believed that the agreement's tough ''pay as you go'' rules and a resulting infusion of revenue eased the recession of the early 1990s, and paved the way for the later budget surpluses and economic boom.
 In his book ''Who's in Control?: Polar Politics and the Sensible Center'' (Simon & Schuster, 1996), Mr. Darman wrote that politics in Congress had made the tax increase ''an inescapable strategic necessity if we were to do what had to be done for the economy.''
 The bipartisan maneuvering that lay behind the budget agreement was Mr. Darman's stock in trade. He steered Reagan's major economic policies through Congress, including the 1981 tax and spending cuts, the Social Security rescue of 1983, and the tax overhaul of 1986.
 Indeed, political operatives coined the term ''Darmanesque'' to describe any set of ploys and tactics designed to pry legislation out of a reluctant Congress. Like a veteran of the British civil service, Mr. Darman, rising ever higher, quietly and effectively worked the levers of power for successive administrations.
 ''I continued to learn from him that I didn't have as many answers as I thought, that I had built an edifice of doctrine, but not a theory of governance,'' David A. Stockman, budget director in the Reagan administration, wrote in ''The Triumph of Politics: Why the Reagan Revolution Failed'' (Harper & Row, 1986).
 In his own book, Mr. Darman described political work as ''heavy lifting.'' 
 ''Viewed in the small,'' he wrote, ''the job is routinely this: lugging stone after stone, day after day, fitting the pieces together.''
 Richard Gordon Darman was born in Charlotte, N.C., on May 10, 1943, and grew up in Wellesley Hills, Mass. His father owned textile mills and marketed oil and gasoline in New England. In 1981, The Washington Post reported that Mr. Darman still regretted getting a 790, rather than a perfect 800, on one part of his high school SATs.
 He made it to Harvard anyway, and was moved when John F. Kennedy returned there, his alma mater, as president-elect. Mr. Darman said he had been ''struck with the sense that government could involve moral and esthetic virtue.'' 
 He graduated from Harvard in 1964 and from Harvard Business School in 1967. He joined the Nixon administration in 1970 and worked under Mr. Richardson in a succession of cabinet departments: Health, Education and Welfare, Defense and Justice. At the Justice Department, he helped arrange the plea bargain that eased Vice President Spiro T. Agnew out of office.
 When Mr. Richardson, the attorney general, resigned in refusing to follow White House orders to fire Archibald Cox, the special prosecutor looking into Watergate, Mr. Darman also quit. He joined the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington before returning to government as an assistant secretary of commerce under Mr. Richardson, and then Mr. Richardson's successor, Mr. Baker.
 At the Commerce Department, Mr. Darman worked on the law- of-the-sea negotiations and continued this work into the Carter administration -- making a total of five presidents for whom he worked. He then consulted and taught until he was appointed executive director of President-elect Reagan's transition team.
 Asked to join the new administration, he wrote his own job description -- managing the flow of White House paperwork -- and got the job with the title assistant to the president. Edwin Meese III, the presidential counselor, said this made Mr. Darman ''the nerve center'' of the administration. He became principal legislative strategist and also participated in foreign policy decisions.
 At the beginning of the second Reagan term, he became deputy secretary of the Treasury. 
 Mr. Darman's pragmatism, willingness to work with Democrats and desire to make a career of government rankled movement conservatives and even aroused their suspicions. In his book ''Revolution: The Reagan Legacy'' (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1988), Martin Anderson, a Reagan aide, called Mr. Darman ''easily the most disliked man in the White House,'' saying he had done nothing for the campaign. 
 But Mr. Darman did help elect Reagan by coaching him for his debates in the 1980 and 1984 campaigns. He reprised the role for Vice President Bush in 1988, preparing him for debating Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts, the Democratic presidential nominee. Mr. Darman wore a tank helmet for the occasion, as Mr. Dukakis had done while posing for a much-derided photograph in a tank.
 Five days after the Bush inauguration, the Senate confirmed Mr. Darman as budget director by a vote of 99 to 0. He was soon negotiating a budget, with Mr. Bush's pledge not to raise taxes a defining element.
 In 1988, Mr. Darman had opposed the promise, but later wrote that he was wrong politically -- even if right economically. He said in his book, ''I was indulging in the fantasy of governing without attending to the imperative of winning.''
 Reviewers of the book remarked that he seemed to see the reversal as merely poor management. Mr. Darman admitted as much in the book, writing, ''The subsequent violation of trust was a problem.''
 After President Bush lost to Bill Clinton in 1992, Mr. Darman joined the Carlyle Group, the private principal investing firm, as a partner and managing director. He was also a professor at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard and chairman of the AES Corporation, an electrical utility. His charitable work included being chairman of the Smithsonian National Museum of American History.
 In addition to his son Jonathan, of Manhattan, Mr. Darman is survived by his mother, Eleanor Darman of Lincoln, Mass.; his wife, the former Kathleen Emmet; two other sons, William, of Brooklyn, and C. T. Emmet, of McLean; a granddaughter, Jane Darman; his sister, Lynn Darman, of Washington, and his brother, John, of West Bridgewater, Mass.
 Mr. Darman cut his own hair; said his hobby was thinking, and was quietly celebrated for the irreverent notes he passed at White House meetings. Once, when Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger was warning of the dire consequences of even the slightest defense cut, Mr. Darman slipped a note to a colleague.
 ''There goes Western civilization for the third time in the last hour,'' he wrote. 

CORRECTION-DATE: January 29, 2008

 CORRECTION:
An obituary on Saturday about the presidential adviser Richard G. Darman misstated the title held by James A. Baker III in the Department of Commerce when Mr. Darman served under him as assistant secretary of commerce. Mr. Baker was under secretary of commerce, not secretary of commerce.

As panic swept European markets on Monday, word spread that a big hedge fund was in trouble and dumping stocks.
 Someone was selling, all right -- Societe Generale. The French bank was frantically unwinding an estimated $75 billion of bad bets on European stocks placed by a rogue trader, Jerome Kerviel. 
 As the bank struggled on Friday to determine how Mr. Kerviel could have run up $7.2 billion in losses before anyone caught on, the scope -- and global impact -- of his fraud began to emerge. 
 From his desk in the middle of the trading floor on the sixth floor of Societe Generale's Alicante building in the La Defense business district outside Paris, Mr. Kerviel, 31, took huge bullish positions on the Dow Jones Euro Stoxx 50 index and the German DAX in particular, according to a fellow trader still working there who insisted on anonymity. 
 Societe Generale rushed to unwind those trades during Monday's market plunge, and trading in those futures contracts soared to record levels. The bank's abrupt reversal contributed to a decline that snowballed into an avalanche of sell orders around the world, some traders said. The ensuing turmoil helped prompt the Federal Reserve to orchestrate the surprise cut in interest rates announced Tuesday. 
 ''I have little doubt that Societe Generale's unwinding of those positions absolutely pressured indexes worldwide,'' said Barry L. Ritholtz, chief executive of FusionIQ, a New York-based investment research and money management firm. ''And wouldn't it be embarrassing if the Fed had to make one of the biggest emergency rate cuts ever because of some rogue trader?''
 Granted, fears of a recession in the United States and continuing worries about the spread of the subprime mortgage collapse were also responsible for the market downdraft in the last 10 days. But Mr. Ritholtz argued the rapid move by Societe Generale to close out tens of billions in futures positions might have been a major factor in pushing an already nervous market into an outright panic.
 Mr. Ritholtz is not alone in his suspicions. ''I definitely think there is a link,'' said Byron R. Wien, chief investment strategist at Pequot Capital Management and a 40-year Wall Street veteran. ''This precipitous unwinding created the negative momentum that spread around the world.'' 
 Mr. Wien also singled out the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, for criticism. ''Bernanke has been reacting to events, rather than anticipating them,'' he said.
 On Monday afternoon, with United States markets closed for Martin Luther King's Birthday, Mr. Ritholtz said, many Wall Streeters were struggling to figure out just why Europe and Asian markets were off so steeply. ''Instant messages were lighting up, and people were saying 'This looks like a big European hedge fund blew up.' '' Indeed, there was little market-moving data before the plunge.
 He was quick to add that the French bank's rapid turnover of the positions assembled by Mr. Kerviel would not have been enough to push the German market down 7.2 percent Monday. But in today's fast-paced markets, hedge funds and investment firms often pile on once the selling starts. ''These things take on a momentum of their own,'' he said.
 On Tuesday, the volume on the DAX and Euro Stoxx 50 contracts was twice that of open futures contracts, suggesting that the bank was having to sell and then buy back contracts to cover leveraged positions. Ten percent of the volume on DAX futures on Tuesday alone was 9.2 billion euros. 
 On a typical day, the total open interest on the Dax futures market is roughly $50 billion, according to Helyette Geman, a professor of mathematical finance at ESSEC business school in Paris. Although the exact positions are not known at this moment, she said, it was quite likely that Societe Generale's trades would have accounted for a major portion of DAX futures activity in recent weeks. She added that settling those positions might have created some downward pressure in the market. 
 The trader said that Mr. Kerviel, a member of Societe Generale's Delta One team, frequently worked late into the night after other members of the group had gone home. He added that it appeared the pace of Mr. Kerviel's trading picked up toward the close of 2007. Many of the trades were placed on near-term futures contracts, the trader said.
 Jean-Pierre Mustier, chief executive of Societe Generale's corporate and investment banking division, declined to identify which particular indexes formed the bulk of the specious trades, but insisted during an interview that closing the positions early in the week did not cause the steep plunge in markets across Europe. 
 Meanwhile, the legal noose appeared to tighten around Mr. Kerviel, as French police raided his apartment in the suburban Paris neighborhood of Neuilly-sur-Seine Friday evening. 
 A spokeswoman for the Paris prosecutor's office, which on Friday opened a preliminary investigation into the case, declined to comment on the raid. ''An investigation is under way,'' said the spokeswoman, Isabelle Montagne. ''We must let the police do their work.'' 
 At the same time, French government authorities signaled growing frustration with Societe Generale. 
 Indeed, Paris appeared to be putting pressure on Societe Generale to come forward with a more detailed accounting of how Mr. Kerviel could have racked up the staggering losses by himself over the course of a year without raising any red flags among either his supervisors or the internal auditors of the bank. 
 Francois Fillon, the French prime minister, expressed frustration Friday at having been kept in the dark about the unfolding crisis until Wednesday -- four days after Societe Generale's chief executive, Daniel Bouton, informed the governor of the country's central bank, Christian Noyer. 
 Speaking to reporters at a briefing in Luxembourg, Mr. Fillon conceded that as a private bank, Societe Generale was not obliged to inform the French government. He said, however: ''It's an affair of such an importance for the French financial system, that maybe the government could have been informed earlier.'' 
 Mr. Fillon said that he had asked the finance minister, Christine Lagarde, to conduct a separate inquiry into the affair and report back to him within eight days. 
 A spokesman for Ms. Lagarde could not be reached for comment. 
 The bank, meanwhile, identified four other individuals, in addition to Mr. Kerviel, who had been dismissed in connection with the scandal and would face disciplinary action: Marc Breillout and Gregoire Varenne, co-heads of fixed-income trading; Christophe Mianne, global head of market activities; and Luc Francois, global head of equities and derivatives activities. 

CORRECTION-DATE: February 5, 2008

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Jan. 26 about Jerome Kerviel, the rogue trader at the French bank Societe Generale, misstated the number of workers dismissed in connection with the scandal. Only one of the employees mentioned -- Luc Francois, global head of equities and derivatives activities -- will leave or move to another position as a result of the investigation. Two other employees, Marc Breillout and Gregoire Varenne, left for reasons unrelated to the scandal and a third, Christophe Mianne, remains at Societe Generale -- they were not dismissed as a result of the Kerviel inquiry.

HEADLINE: So Many Places to Live, But So Far Out of Reach

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS 

 BODY:
Thousands of people are looking for a place to live in this city. Many thousands of houses are vacant or for sale, and acres of land sit empty.
 But turning potential housing into inhabited homes is proving to be a major challenge, even for a city that survived the fury of Hurricane Katrina and the failure of the levees. For those who need shelter the most, these houses are out of reach. 
 More than 8,800 houses are for sale in the New Orleans metropolitan area -- almost as many as were sold in the last 12 months, according to one of the city's leading real estate brokerage firms. High insurance costs and the crash in the mortgage market nationwide have slowed sales here, whether people are moving out of town or opting to relocate to a different neighborhood.
 Thousands more damaged houses -- probably 6,000 within the city limits -- are being bought by the State of Louisiana through its Road Home program, which compensates homeowners for their losses in the 2005 hurricanes. These properties will be turned over to local governments for redevelopment or resale. (By one estimate, as many as 20,000 buildings in the city are derelict.) 
 Meanwhile, 27,500 families, mostly from New Orleans, are still living in tiny, tinny government-issued travel trailers across the state, waiting for their homes to be repaired or for some kind of affordable housing to become available. Many other people remain in faraway cities. And hundreds -- by some accounts, thousands -- live on the city streets.
 The housing situation in New Orleans varies almost block by block. Some areas are hotter than before the storm; others are wastelands. In some neighborhoods, new or rebuilt houses are scattered among empty lots and boarded-up homes, a phenomenon known here as the jack-o'-lantern effect.
 By Lake Pontchartrain, in a middle-class neighborhood called Vista Park, a resident, K. C. King, can see a little of everything: new houses raised 10 feet above sea level to surpass new flood regulations, abandoned ranch houses with moldy furniture inside, bald lots, for-sale signs, travel trailers and one renovated house -- not popular with the neighbors -- that has been turned into a rental. There is even a swimming pool still full of what people living nearby say is filthy floodwater.
 ''In this neighborhood,'' Mr. King said, ''the jack-o'-lantern effect is in 3-D.''
 Many reasons figure into the mismatch between the need and availability of housing, including history, geography, lingering storm damage and the impact of government programs, intended and unintended. The factor most obvious to economists is price. 
 ''At the very low end of the income strata, we do have a shortage of housing,'' said Ivan J. Miestchovich, director of the Center for Economic Development and Real Estate at the University of New Orleans. 
 Demand for expensive property, however, is low. ''On houses more than $350,000 in price, your marketing time is 18 months,'' Dr. Miestchovich said. ''Over $1 million, it's two years and more.'' 
 Housing prices, which spiked after the 2005 storm, have been declining. The average sale price in the city dropped to $159,000 in November, the lowest level in years (though it increased in December to an average of $222,000). Even so, sales numbers have been weak for the last few months.
 Part of New Orleans's allure used to be that it was possible to live well on little because a lot of cheap, if rundown, housing was available -- a result of years of slow migration from the city. Much of that housing was destroyed; many remaining properties need expensive repairs.
 Construction and insurance costs have soared, and borrowers need better credit records to get a housing loan because of problems in the national mortgage market, said Mtumishi St. Julien, executive director of the Finance Authority of New Orleans.
 Before Hurricane Katrina, most people in the city were renters, not owners, and more than 50,000 rental units in the metropolitan area were damaged or destroyed when the floodwaters rose. Rents at the remaining apartments shot up by almost 50 percent; a two-bedroom apartment that might have rented for $660 a month in 2004 now costs close to $1,000 a month, according to federal data.
 Efforts to help replace rental housing got off to a slow start. Melissa Landry, press secretary for the Louisiana Recovery Authority, said state programs were helping to build 25,000 apartments that would be affordable for low-income residents.
 The state, the city and private civic organizations like the Jeremiah Group are hoping eventually to turn those renters into homeowners, by providing subsidies, reducing construction costs and finding a way to cut the price of insurance. 
 Local and federal officials said they did not expect an increase in homelessness after recent decisions to demolish public housing projects and to close trailer parks run by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
 But people who work with the families in question are not so sure. The Rev. Marshall Truehill Jr., pastor of the First United Baptist Church, said he was so concerned about an influx of homeless families that he asked the city to convert several former school buildings into shelters. 
 Based on the turnout at recent forums and public meetings, one question on the minds of many people here is what will happen to all the houses, most badly damaged, that the Road Home program is buying from people who are not rebuilding.
 In the city, the properties will be handled by the New Orleans Redevelopment Authority, which before the hurricanes was supposed to deal with blighted properties, and by most accounts failed. Joseph Williams, a former banker who became executive director of the agency a year ago, said it had been underfinanced and understaffed in the past but was gearing up to deal with both the Road Home properties and abandoned sites. 
 Progress has been slow. Last fall, the agency sold 27 blighted properties for redevelopment pilot projects; a nonprofit group called Assisting Hand will break ground Friday on the first of these, in the Seventh Ward.
 But what the agency will be able to do with the Road Home properties remains unclear. For one thing, it does not yet know all their locations. In addition to proposals to encourage developers to build or rebuild housing that could be made affordable, the agency is actually planning to reduce the amount of potential housing by allowing neighbors to buy adjacent properties to, for example, expand their yards.
 That is what Mr. King would like to do with the house next to his in the Vista Park neighborhood -- or rather, next to where his house will be when he rebuilds. He and his wife, Kathi, are still trailer-bound. But many details remain to be worked out, like how much the city will charge for the property. 
 ''I'd just as soon buy it and split it with the neighbors,'' he said. ''But I'm not sure I can afford it.''

PERSON: Rupert F. Richardson 

HEADLINE: Rupert F. Richardson, 78, Former N.A.A.C.P. Leader

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: BATON ROUGE, La. 

 BODY:
Rupert F. Richardson, a civil rights leader and a former national president of the N.A.A.C.P., died here on Thursday. She was 78.
 Ms. Richardson collapsed and died as she was decorating a home she had recently moved into, her son, Thomas Clemons, told a Baton Rouge newspaper, The Advocate. An official cause of death has not been announced. 
 With the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, Ms. Richardson led efforts to widen the organization's scope of civil rights to include human rights and economic parity. From 1992 to 1995, she served nationally as the group's president and was named president emeritus following that term.
 Before that, she served eight years as vice president and also had a 16-year tenure as president of the Louisiana State Conference of the N.A.A.C.P., which created the Rupert F. Richardson Presidential Award in her honor.
 Funeral arrangements were pending but there were tentative plans to hold services in Baton Rouge and Lake Charles, her hometown, the group said Friday in a written statement. 
 ''Rupert Richardson served the N.A.A.C.P. in many, many capacities; but she will be best remembered as a tireless crusader for justice in Louisiana,'' said Julian Bond, chairman of the group's national board of directors, in the statement.
 In the late 1990s, Ms. Richardson served in the state Department of Health and Hospitals under Bobby Jindal, who is now governor.
 She led the National Health Committee of the N.A.A.C.P., working to reduce H.I.V./AIDS cases, and she started her own health care consulting firm in 1994 after retiring as Louisiana's deputy assistant secretary for alcohol and drug abuse. She also worked at the state level in the areas of health planning, mental health, employment and substance abuse.
 Ms. Richardson, who earned a bachelor's degree from Southern University and a master's degrees in counseling and psychology from McNeese State University, also helped with efforts to re-evaluate the civil rights group's mission and strategic plan, working with the Harvard University School of Business.
 In addition, she served as a member of the Louisiana Gaming Control Board, the Louisiana Commission on Human Rights, the Louisiana Advisory Committee to the United States Commission on Civil Rights and the advisory board of the Louisiana State University School of Social Welfare.

HEADLINE: An Escape From Rwanda, Then a Struggle to Survive in New York

BYLINE: By KARI HASKELL

 BODY:
As conditions in his homeland, Rwanda, went from tense to murderously chaotic in the mid-1990s, Stan Knight clung to his music. 
 Before the wave of violence that erupted in 1994 -- and even, for a time, after it -- Mr. Knight, then a teenager, earned money as a D.J. at clubs and parties in Rwanda's capital, Kigali, spinning records by American hip-hop and R & B artists. 
 ''It makes you feel good knowing that without the music, people would have been thinking about the situation they were in,'' said Mr. Knight, now 27. ''They could escape all their problems for that moment.'' 
 But it was hard to escape the problems for long. Though he evaded the genocide that claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of his fellow Tutsis in the span of a few weeks, Mr. Knight could not avoid the disorder and the fear that followed. The streets teemed with thugs, preying on impressionable youths and urging them to join their ranks. Men armed with AK-47s ransacked his home, terrorizing his family in ways he is reluctant to talk about. He knew he had to leave. 
 For five years he was adrift, he said, a refugee in central Africa: to Zaire (now called Congo), to Uganda, to Kenya, back to Congo. Finally, he and a friend sneaked onto a cargo ship, concealing themselves in a container that held clothing and electronics. They crept out only to take peanuts, bread and water from the ship's galley when the ship stopped in ports, which it did several times. Each time, they wondered where they were and whether it was time to get off. His friend left the ship sooner; Mr. Knight does not know what became of him. 
 When the ship arrived in New Jersey -- he still does not know which city it was -- in February 1999, he emerged from his metal box malnourished and dazed after three months of hiding.
 A dockworker found Mr. Knight, who had learned English as a child, and asked him if he was part of the crew. Mr. Knight told him the truth, though he was afraid he would be deported. The man instead took him to a Manhattan church. When he told the people there his story, they took him to Covenant House, where he was given food, and a place to bathe and sleep. 
 Workers there helped him apply for political asylum, Section 8 housing and other assistance. He worked in retail and continued to pursue his interest in music.
 When his Section 8 housing came through in 2004, Mr. Knight left Covenant House. His new home is a tiny apartment with a kitchenette in a town house on the Upper West Side. He has his own bathroom, though he has to walk down the hall to get to it. 
 He continued to support himself with retail jobs until a seasonal position at J. Crew ended in 2006. Mr. Knight was hopeful he would find work before he went through his savings, but he did not. He was unemployed for about a year. ''It was a struggle to find a job that would work out,'' he said. ''It was a horrible time.'' 
 He received $63 a month in food stamps; when he ran out, he did not eat. He sat in the dark because he could not pay his electricity bill. His rent was $80 a month, but he could not pay it. 
 He walked as far as he could in every direction from his apartment, stopping at stores to seek work.
 ''I was this close to losing the apartment,'' he said, holding up his hand with his thumb near his index finger. 
 The Coalition for the Homeless referred him to the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies. Last February, the federation, one of the seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, drew $800 from the fund to cover 10 months of back rent. For the balance, he was able to scrape together $80, and public assistance paid $80. 
 ''I was lucky,'' he said, adding how thankful he was for the grant. Soon after, he found work as a customer service representative in the men's department at Filene's Basement, where he works today. 
 ''I'm trying to reach my goal to be somebody,'' he said. Notebooks stacked by his bed are full of lyrics, ideas and dreams. 
 ''I get inspiration from everywhere -- just the daily struggles, people trying to get by -- I take all that and just put it into music,'' Mr. Knight said. 
 Recently, he recorded a few tracks and has put them on his MySpace page. Last week, he started college courses in marketing at Borough of Manhattan Community College. 
 ''Every day, it is getting a little better,'' he said. ''I feel lucky I am alive, that I am breathing.''

HEADLINE: Put the 'Emergency!' Back in the E.R.

 BODY:
To the Editor: 
 As ''Emergency Room Delays'' (editorial, Jan. 19) notes, the nation's failure to provide universal health care puts all citizens at risk. But the system is not being clogged by uninsured patients seeking routine care. 
 The reality is that the majority of the uninsured delay seeking any care until they are very ill. The overriding reason for lengthening wait times is the boarding of acute patients, sometimes for days in emergency departments, while waiting for inpatient beds on other floors. 
 The American College of Emergency Physicians supports the drive for national health care reform. But as part of that reform, let's not forget about solving basic staffing and bed shortages, and the reimbursement issues that contribute. 
 America's emergency departments are filling in the gap to save lives, despite a broken health care system. But they cannot continue providing this vital safety net without proper financing and resources, and without adequate, comprehensive health care reform.
 Linda L. Lawrence Washington, Jan. 23, 2008
 The writer is president of the American College of Emergency Physicians.
 To the Editor:
 If every American had a local primary care center that was open until 8 p.m. and opened on weekends, and staffed with a team of professionals that included doctors, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, visiting nurses, psychologists, social workers, physical therapists and pharmacists, we would have no emergency room delays and health care that costs 40 percent less than we are paying now, and we would have a health care system instead of a mess that is also a dangerous maze.
 Why don't we just build it? Talk about economic stimulus. We would employ all those out-of-work construction crews, and make American products affordable again by allowing our businesses to function unencumbered by a health insurance system that doesn't work and costs way too much. 
 And we might actually get a health care system that delivers health to the many, instead of profit to the few.
 Michael Fine Scituate, R.I., Jan. 19, 2008
 The writer is a doctor and co-author of a book about how to build our health care system.
 To the Editor:
 It is convenient to believe that the ''nation's failure to provide health insurance for all Americans'' is ''one very plausible interpretation of a disturbing increase in waiting times at emergency rooms.'' This connection is, at best, a nice thought.
 There is plenty of merit to the idea of universal health coverage as an economic and social phenomenon. 
 But it cannot so automatically solve the problems -- such as increasing access to primary care to help alleviate emergency room overcrowding or routing patients to less crowded emergency rooms -- that contribute to the long lines.
 Long wait times are a management dysfunction, whether in an emergency room, the Department of Motor Vehicles or a Starbucks. They are a failure of management's task and responsibility to efficiently and effectively place people where they need to be at a particular time.
 Before we accept universal health coverage, we ought to demand better management. 
 Lee H. Igel New York, Jan. 19, 2008
 To the Editor:
 My mother, who is 89, recently had two extremely traumatic experiences in the emergency room. One time she waited over 36 hours, the other time over 20 hours, before they found a room for her. Both times she emotionally came apart, and her condition dramatically deteriorated. 
 Since reactions such as my mother's are extremely common, I think there should be a special emergency room for older people that at least tries to mitigate, as much as possible, the nightmare of dislocation, as well as some of the horrible spinoff damaging effects of being there. Separate emergency rooms are already in place for children and people with asthma.
 Sadly, there's no way of escaping the fact that what happens on the bottom floor of a hospital has an impact on what later happens on the upper floors.

HEADLINE: A Voice of Skepticism on the Impact of Steroids

BYLINE: By ALAN SCHWARZ. 
E-mail: keepingscore@nytimes.com

 BODY:
One of the most influential baseball minds of the last 40 years is angry. And he is coming out of retirement to vent.
 Fans may not know Eric Walker's name, but they know his handiwork. Walker was a National Public Radio correspondent in the early 1980s when he began filling the San Francisco airwaves with his theories regarding baseball -- specifically, that on-base percentage was undervalued, fielding was misunderstood and power ruled all. One increasingly intrigued listener was Sandy Alderson, then a young Athletics executive, who soon hired Walker as a team consultant and with him devised the Oakland philosophy now called Moneyball. Walker has been out of baseball for 10 years and lives in a small farm town in eastern Washington. But the recent hullabaloo over steroids and other illicit substances has prompted him to conduct new research with a rather surprising conclusion: the popular perception that slugging across baseball has increased during the ''steroid era'' is almost certainly wrong.
 ''If power were up, we'd see it in the statistics,'' Walker said. ''But the boost just isn't there.'' 
 Walker contends that popular measures often used to demonstrate the baseballwide effects of so-called performance-enhancing drugs -- like the rise in home runs per game and overall runs per game -- are the wrong place to look. Since any added strength hitters get from steroids would not help them make solid contact with the ball, but only hit it farther when they do, Walker instead examined a more appropriate statistic: total bases per hit, also known as Power Factor.
 Although not all doubles and triples indicate power, P.F. does a far better job of isolating the effects that brawn would breed. It also helps see past historical rule changes like the height of the pitcher's mound and the size of the strike zone; such tweaks drastically alter the number of hits, walks and runs games feature, but they have much less effect on the distance that struck balls travel.
 Walker examined overall P.F. figures for all seasons since 1900, and discovered that they have steadily increased from about 1.3 to 1.6 throughout those 100-plus years -- not since only the early 1990s, when steroids are believed to have begun their gradual rise in use and slugging effect.
 Walker found two substantial and essentially permanent jumps. First was the 1920s, because of the introduction of a livelier ball and the sport's Babe Ruth-inspired embrace of slugging. The second was in 1993 and 1994, when P.F. suddenly leapt 7 percent to about 1.6, where it has since settled. Walker contends that such a jump is far more indicative of a change made to the ball -- which Major League Baseball has long denied -- than a steroid power boost, which would have produced an effect far more gradual as the decade progressed.
 Subtract that 1993-94 spasm from subsequent records, Walker said, and you will find that power since 1980 has remained essentially flat.
 ''There is no long-term uptrend in pure power,'' Walker said of the last quarter-century. ''Nothing to indicate that a gradual change in culture and steroid use affected how far balls were hit -- when they were hit in the first place.''
 He added: ''I have no doubt that to a swimmer in the Olympics, steroids have an effect -- even if the augmentation is minuscule, the augmentation is significant because those competitions are settled by an eye blink. In baseball, if it were there, we'd see it in those numbers. But it isn't there. If it's there, it's not a discernible one.''
 Unprecedented late-career numbers from some individual players who have been accused of using steroids -- like Barry Bonds's 73 home runs in 2001 and Roger Clemens's charge to 354 victories -- still raise the question of what benefits baseball players may receive from illicit substances.
 But Walker is not a lone voice out in the Washington wilderness; many credible statistical analysts are similarly skeptical about how much steroids and other drugs may have distorted modern ballplayers' records. Regarding Bonds, for example, they note that, yes, his peak home run rates came at 36 through 39 years old, when most players are in decline. Then again, another slugger three decades before enjoyed almost the same late-30s surge: a fellow named Hank Aaron.
 ''People who look at baseball stats know that the current era is different than it has been in the past, but it's not as abnormal as people might think,'' said J. C. Bradbury, an economist at Kennesaw State University in Georgia. ''Offense has been up, but for lots of reasons.''
 Walker is convinced those reasons have been wildly misunderstood, and has built a Web site (steroids-and-baseball.com) spelling out his theories in hopes that his message carries even half as far as Moneyball did.
 ''I'm tired of people saying, 'This is what happened because I see more home runs,' '' Walker said. ''If you disagree with me, deconstruct the argument; tell me where it's wrong. If you can, more power to you.''
 As it were.

HEADLINE: Plan to Close Prisons Stirs Anxiety in Towns That Depend on Them

BYLINE: By FERNANDA SANTOS

DATELINE: GABRIELS, N.Y. 

 BODY:
After 17 years of marriage, Joy and Richard Gonyea managed to save enough to trade their trailer in November for a cozy prefabricated home with a room for each of their two children and a pool in the backyard. The home overlooks the pine trees on the edge of their two-acre property in rural Vermontville, eight miles from the secluded state prison where Mrs. Gonyea works.
 ''This home is all we've ever dreamed of,'' said Mrs. Gonyea, 43, a registered nurse who runs the medical department at the prison, Camp Gabriels, a minimum-security facility in this minuscule hamlet in Franklin County, at the northern end of Adirondack Park.
 ''This,'' she said, ''is the place we always wanted to have for our kids.'' 
 Then she began to cry.
 On Jan. 11, the Spitzer administration announced plans to close Camp Gabriels, two other corrections camps and a medium-security prison, all of which have been operating below capacity since 1996 because of a decline in the number of nonviolent felons, the state's corrections commissioner, Brian Fischer, said. 
 Closing those prisons, Mr. Fischer said, would save the state millions of dollars, free up money for the treatment of sex offenders and mentally ill inmates, and finance programs like anger management and vocational training, meant to prepare prisoners for their release.
 But for Mrs. Gonyea, her neighbors and co-workers, the prospect of losing Camp Gabriels has stoked fear and doubt -- about their future and about the future of their communities, which have come to depend on the prison over the years to survive.
 As rural economies across the country crumbled in the 1980s and the population of prison inmates swelled, largely because of tougher drug laws, states pushed prison construction as an economic escape route of sorts. Throughout the 1960s and '70s, an average of four prisons were built each year in rural America; the rate quadrupled in the 1980s and reached 24 a year in the 1990s, according to the federal Agriculture Department's economic research service.
 The boom, experts say, provided employment, but it also fostered a cycle of dependency. Depressed rural communities came to rely on the prisons as a source of jobs, economic sustenance and services, with little effort devoted to attracting other viable businesses.
 ''What we've seen in New York and other states is that one prison led to another prison and led to another prison, creating the notion that there's no other economic development option than to build prisons to foster stability in rural areas,'' said Tracy Huling, an independent consultant in New York who has done extensive research on the role of prisons in rural economies.
 None of the 584 workers at Camp Gabriels and the other prisons slated to close -- Camp McGregor in Saratoga County, Camp Pharsalia in Chenango County and the Hudson Correctional Facility in Columbia County -- are expected to lose their jobs; state and union officials have said the workers will be able to transfer to other prisons.
 But when that will happen, where the new jobs will be or even whether there will be jobs for everyone, are bound to remain open questions for months to come.
 The uncertainty has gnawed on residents here and in several other communities in this remote, challenging region where below-zero temperatures are the norm this time of year. The correction industry is big business in Franklin County, which has five state prisons and one federal prison in its 1,678 sparsely populated square miles. In the town of Brighton, which encompasses Gabriels and five other hamlets, the prison is perhaps the only place where someone with a high school diploma can earn a decent wage and benefits.
 ''There ain't much else the local people could do for gainful employment,'' said Peter Martin, 48, the town's supervisor and a corrections officer at Camp Gabriels for 22 years.
 The camp employs 136 people, including 85 corrections officers.
 The reliance on Camp Gabriels extends well beyond jobs. Small businesses have staked their survival on the prison workers who patronize their stores. Local governments and charities, meanwhile, have come to depend on inmate work crews to clear snow from fire hydrants, maintain parks and hiking trails, mow the lawns at cemeteries and unload trucks at food pantries. 
 Every winter, the crews help build an ice palace in the nearby village of Saranac Lake, cutting thick blocks of ice that can weigh up to 700 pounds. The palace is the main attraction of the village's Winter Carnival and attracts thousands to the area.
 ''All those services, when you put that into dollars, there's no way we'd be able to hire people to perform them,'' said Mary Ellen Keith, supervisor of the town of Franklin, which relies on the crews to cut overgrown brush from the sides of 67 miles of local roads, among other tasks. (Franklin is just south of Brighton and another of the 19 towns that make up Franklin County.) 
 Four of Mrs. Keith's nine children work in state prisons, she said, including a son and a daughter at Camp Gabriels.
 ''Everyone around here either works in the prisons, or has a relative who works in the prisons, or knows someone who works in the prisons,'' said Mrs. Keith, 78. ''My kids were able to build their homes and raise their families here because of the prisons. If it weren't for the prisons, they would have had to leave the area.'' 
 Prisons are also a valuable political tool, because inmates are counted as local residents, allowing communities to receive more state and federal aid for emergency services. Mr. Martin said that he was not yet sure how the town of Brighton stood to lose if Camp Gabriels closed, but he added, ''We're concerned about losing any kind of aid here.'' 
 Inmate-inclusive population counts are also used when drawing legislative and Congressional district lines. 
 Franklin County has struggled to find its economic footing. The terrain is carved by mountains, streams and lakes, with limited farmland. Much of it falls inside Adirondack Park, so development must abide by strict rules. Tourism is strong, but concentrated in a few areas. Winters are long and the wind so cold it seems to slice the skin, like tiny razor blades. The soil is frozen for most of the year; the growing season lasts from May through September, yielding potatoes and some grain crops, but little else. 
 In Gabriels, which has about 800 residents, including the prison's 186 inmates, the closest thing to Main Street is a half-mile stretch of state highway, Route 86. It has two mini-markets, two farms, a general store, a cafe, a temporary post office (the permanent one burned last winter) and a few dozen homes. Camp Gabriels is set back from the highway, shrouded by tall pines.
 The camp opened in 1982, in a building once occupied by a sanitarium. It has no fences; trees delimit its perimeter. At its peak, it held 336 inmates. 
 ''There's no doubt that closing prisons could bring short-term economic distress to some areas, but the question is, is that a justification for refusing to make changes? The answer should be no,'' said Edmund J. McMahon, director of the Empire Center for New York State Policy, a conservative group. ''There should be other ways of improving the economic situation in upstate New York that doesn't involve filling upstate New York with prisons.'' 
 Gov. George E. Pataki tried to close prisons in New York each fiscal year from 2002 to 2006, but he faced intense pressure from upstate legislators and union leaders, who are already objecting to Gov. Eliot Spitzer's proposal. 
 This is Mr. Spitzer's first try to close prisons and, officials say, it is a necessary step to help the state bridge a projected $4.4 billion budget gap and adapt its corrections system to the number and types of inmates it now serves. The closings, scheduled for January 2009, would save the state more than $40 million in operating costs over the next two years and $30 million over five years in repair costs. 
 ''This is as much a budget issue as it is a management issue,'' Mr. Fischer, the corrections commissioner, said in an interview. ''I've got a finite budget and I've got a finite work force, and I have to use them where my needs are, and that's in the larger facilities.''
 The number of inmates housed in the state's maximum-security prisons increased by 18 percent from 1996 to 2007, while the inmate population in medium-security prisons declined by the same rate. During that period, the number of prisoners in minimum-security facilities -- most convicted of larceny, burglary, minor drug possession and other nonviolent crimes -- decreased by 47 percent, officials said.
 Six months before closing Camp Gabriels and the other prisons, the state must detail what it plans to do with the emptied facilities. Mr. Fischer said that it was too early to tell what those plans would be, but that the state would consider public and private uses for the properties.
 Union leaders and many Camp Gabriels workers said they would not give in easily, though. They organized a rally in Saranac Lake on Thursday and a letter-writing campaign, hoping to convince state legislators that the prison was worth saving. 
 ''I told my wife we should hang in there,'' said Mr. Gonyea, 44, who retired in 2005 after working for 23 years as a corrections officer, 17 of those at Camp Gabriels. ''The anxiety, all this doubt, it's killing us. But it's not over yet.''

HEADLINE: Rethinking the Meat-Guzzler

BYLINE: By MARK BITTMAN. 
Mark Bittman, who writes the Minimalist column in the Dining In and Dining Out sections, is the author of ''How to Cook Everything Vegetarian,'' which was published last year. He is not a vegetarian.

 BODY:
A SEA change in the consumption of a resource that Americans take for granted may be in store -- something cheap, plentiful, widely enjoyed and a part of daily life. And it isn't oil. 
 It's meat. 
 The two commodities share a great deal: Like oil, meat is subsidized by the federal government. Like oil, meat is subject to accelerating demand as nations become wealthier, and this, in turn, sends prices higher. Finally -- like oil -- meat is something people are encouraged to consume less of, as the toll exacted by industrial production increases, and becomes increasingly visible. 
 Global demand for meat has multiplied in recent years, encouraged by growing affluence and nourished by the proliferation of huge, confined animal feeding operations. These assembly-line meat factories consume enormous amounts of energy, pollute water supplies, generate significant greenhouse gases and require ever-increasing amounts of corn, soy and other grains, a dependency that has led to the destruction of vast swaths of the world's tropical rain forests.
 Just this week, the president of Brazil announced emergency measures to halt the burning and cutting of the country's rain forests for crop and grazing land. In the last five months alone, the government says, 1,250 square miles were lost. 
 The world's total meat supply was 71 million tons in 1961. In 2007, it was estimated to be 284 million tons. Per capita consumption has more than doubled over that period. (In the developing world, it rose twice as fast, doubling in the last 20 years.) World meat consumption is expected to double again by 2050, which one expert, Henning Steinfeld of the United Nations, says is resulting in a ''relentless growth in livestock production.''
 Americans eat about the same amount of meat as we have for some time, about eight ounces a day, roughly twice the global average. At about 5 percent of the world's population, we ''process'' (that is, grow and kill) nearly 10 billion animals a year, more than 15 percent of the world's total. 
 Growing meat (it's hard to use the word ''raising'' when applied to animals in factory farms) uses so many resources that it's a challenge to enumerate them all. But consider: an estimated 30 percent of the earth's ice-free land is directly or indirectly involved in livestock production, according to the United Nation's Food and Agriculture Organization, which also estimates that livestock production generates nearly a fifth of the world's greenhouse gases -- more than transportation.
 To put the energy-using demand of meat production into easy-to-understand terms, Gidon Eshel, a geophysicist at the Bard Center, and Pamela A. Martin, an assistant professor of geophysics at the University of Chicago, calculated that if Americans were to reduce meat consumption by just 20 percent it would be as if we all switched from a standard sedan -- a Camry, say -- to the ultra-efficient Prius. Similarly, a study last year by the National Institute of Livestock and Grassland Science in Japan estimated that 2.2 pounds of beef is responsible for the equivalent amount of carbon dioxide emitted by the average European car every 155 miles, and burns enough energy to light a 100-watt bulb for nearly 20 days.
 Grain, meat and even energy are roped together in a way that could have dire results. More meat means a corresponding increase in demand for feed, especially corn and soy, which some experts say will contribute to higher prices.
 This will be inconvenient for citizens of wealthier nations, but it could have tragic consequences for those of poorer ones, especially if higher prices for feed divert production away from food crops. The demand for ethanol is already pushing up prices, and explains, in part, the 40 percent rise last year in the food price index calculated by the United Nations' Food and Agricultural Organization. 
 Though some 800 million people on the planet now suffer from hunger or malnutrition, the majority of corn and soy grown in the world feeds cattle, pigs and chickens. This despite the inherent inefficiencies: about two to five times more grain is required to produce the same amount of calories through livestock as through direct grain consumption, according to Rosamond Naylor, an associate professor of economics at Stanford University. It is as much as 10 times more in the case of grain-fed beef in the United States. 
 The environmental impact of growing so much grain for animal feed is profound. Agriculture in the United States -- much of which now serves the demand for meat -- contributes to nearly three-quarters of all water-quality problems in the nation's rivers and streams, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.
 Because the stomachs of cattle are meant to digest grass, not grain, cattle raised industrially thrive only in the sense that they gain weight quickly. This diet made it possible to remove cattle from their natural environment and encourage the efficiency of mass confinement and slaughter. But it causes enough health problems that administration of antibiotics is routine, so much so that it can result in antibiotic-resistant bacteria that threaten the usefulness of medicines that treat people. 
 Those grain-fed animals, in turn, are contributing to health problems among the world's wealthier citizens -- heart disease, some types of cancer, diabetes. The argument that meat provides useful protein makes sense, if the quantities are small. But the ''you gotta eat meat'' claim collapses at American levels. Even if the amount of meat we eat weren't harmful, it's way more than enough.
 Americans are downing close to 200 pounds of meat, poultry and fish per capita per year (dairy and eggs are separate, and hardly insignificant), an increase of 50 pounds per person from 50 years ago. We each consume something like 110 grams of protein a day, about twice the federal government's recommended allowance; of that, about 75 grams come from animal protein. (The recommended level is itself considered by many dietary experts to be higher than it needs to be.) It's likely that most of us would do just fine on around 30 grams of protein a day, virtually all of it from plant sources .
 What can be done? There's no simple answer. Better waste management, for one. Eliminating subsidies would also help; the United Nations estimates that they account for 31 percent of global farm income. Improved farming practices would help, too. Mark W. Rosegrant, director of environment and production technology at the nonprofit International Food Policy Research Institute, says, ''There should be investment in livestock breeding and management, to reduce the footprint needed to produce any given level of meat.'' 
 Then there's technology. Israel and Korea are among the countries experimenting with using animal waste to generate electricity. Some of the biggest hog operations in the United States are working, with some success, to turn manure into fuel. 
 Longer term, it no longer seems lunacy to believe in the possibility of ''meat without feet'' -- meat produced in vitro, by growing animal cells in a super-rich nutrient environment before being further manipulated into burgers and steaks.
 Another suggestion is a return to grazing beef, a very real alternative as long as you accept the psychologically difficult and politically unpopular notion of eating less of it. That's because grazing could never produce as many cattle as feedlots do. Still, said Michael Pollan, author of the recent book ''In Defense of Food,'' ''In places where you can't grow grain, fattening cows on grass is always going to make more sense.'' 
 But pigs and chickens, which convert grain to meat far more efficiently than beef, are increasingly the meats of choice for producers, accounting for 70 percent of total meat production, with industrialized systems producing half that pork and three-quarters of the chicken. 
 Once, these animals were raised locally (even many New Yorkers remember the pigs of Secaucus), reducing transportation costs and allowing their manure to be spread on nearby fields. Now hog production facilities that resemble prisons more than farms are hundreds of miles from major population centers, and their manure ''lagoons'' pollute streams and groundwater. (In Iowa alone, hog factories and farms produce more than 50 million tons of excrement annually.) 
 These problems originated here, but are no longer limited to the United States. While the domestic demand for meat has leveled off, the industrial production of livestock is growing more than twice as fast as land-based methods, according to the United Nations. 
 Perhaps the best hope for change lies in consumers' becoming aware of the true costs of industrial meat production. ''When you look at environmental problems in the U.S.,'' says Professor Eshel, ''nearly all of them have their source in food production and in particular meat production. And factory farming is 'optimal' only as long as degrading waterways is free. If dumping this stuff becomes costly -- even if it simply carries a non-zero price tag -- the entire structure of food production will change dramatically.''
 Animal welfare may not yet be a major concern, but as the horrors of raising meat in confinement become known, more animal lovers may start to react. And would the world not be a better place were some of the grain we use to grow meat directed instead to feed our fellow human beings?
 Real prices of beef, pork and poultry have held steady, perhaps even decreased, for 40 years or more (in part because of grain subsidies), though we're beginning to see them increase now. But many experts, including Tyler Cowen, a professor of economics at George Mason University, say they don't believe meat prices will rise high enough to affect demand in the United States.
 ''I just don't think we can count on market prices to reduce our meat consumption,'' he said. ''There may be a temporary spike in food prices, but it will almost certainly be reversed and then some. But if all the burden is put on eaters, that's not a tragic state of affairs.''
 If price spikes don't change eating habits, perhaps the combination of deforestation, pollution, climate change, starvation, heart disease and animal cruelty will gradually encourage the simple daily act of eating more plants and fewer animals. 
 Mr. Rosegrant of the food policy research institute says he foresees ''a stronger public relations campaign in the reduction of meat consumption -- one like that around cigarettes -- emphasizing personal health, compassion for animals, and doing good for the poor and the planet.'' 
 It wouldn't surprise Professor Eshel if all of this had a real impact. ''The good of people's bodies and the good of the planet are more or less perfectly aligned,'' he said. 
 The United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization, in its detailed 2006 study of the impact of meat consumption on the planet, ''Livestock's Long Shadow,'' made a similar point: ''There are reasons for optimism that the conflicting demands for animal products and environmental services can be reconciled. Both demands are exerted by the same group of people ... the relatively affluent, middle- to high-income class, which is no longer confined to industrialized countries. ... This group of consumers is probably ready to use its growing voice to exert pressure for change and may be willing to absorb the inevitable price increases.''
 In fact, Americans are already buying more environmentally friendly products, choosing more sustainably produced meat, eggs and dairy. The number of farmers' markets has more than doubled in the last 10 years or so, and it has escaped no one's notice that the organic food market is growing fast. These all represent products that are more expensive but of higher quality. 
 If those trends continue, meat may become a treat rather than a routine. It won't be uncommon, but just as surely as the S.U.V. will yield to the hybrid, the half-pound-a-day meat era will end. 
 Maybe that's not such a big deal. ''Who said people had to eat meat three times a day?'' asked Mr. Pollan.

HEADLINE: Freed From the Page, but a Book Nonetheless

BYLINE: By RANDALL STROSS. 
Randall Stross is an author based in Silicon Valley and a professor of business at San Jose State University. E-mail: stross@nytimes.com

 BODY:
PRINTED books provide pleasures no device created by an electrical engineer can match. The sweet smell of a brand-new book. The tactile pleasures of turning a page. The reassuring sight on one's bookshelves of personal journeys. 
 But not one of these explains why books have resisted digitization. That's simpler: Books are portable and easy to read. 
 Building a portable electronic reader was the easy part; matching the visual quality of ink on paper took longer. But display technology has advanced to the point where the digital page is easy on the eyes, too. At last, an e-reader performs well when placed in page-to-page competition with paper. 
 As a result, the digitization of personal book collections is certain to have its day soon. 
 Music shows the way. The digitization of personal music collections began, however, only after the right combination of software and hardware -- iTunes Music Store and the iPod -- arrived. And as Apple did for music lovers, some company will devise an irresistible combination of software and hardware for book buyers. That company may be Amazon. 
 Amazon's first iteration of an electronic book reader is the Kindle. Introduced in November, it weighs about 10 ounces, holds more than 200 full-length books and can display newspapers, magazines and blogs. It uses E Ink technology, developed by the company of that name, that produces sharply defined text yet draws power only when a page is changed, not as it is displayed. 
 Sony uses E Ink in its e-book Reader, which it introduced in 2006, but the Kindle has a feature that neither Sony nor many e-reader predecessors ever possessed: books and other content can be loaded wirelessly, from just about anywhere in the United States, using the high-speed EVDO network from Sprint.
 This may turn out to be a red-letter day in the history of convenience -- our age's equivalent of that magical moment FedEx introduced next-day delivery and people asked, ''How was life possible before this?''
 The Kindle is expensive -- $399 -- but it sold out in just six hours after its debut on Nov. 19. Since then, supplies have consistently lagged behind demand, and a waiting list remains in place.
 The Kindle gets many things right, or at least I assume it does. I haven't had much of a chance to test out my demonstration unit. My wife, skeptical that a digital screen could ever approach the readability of ink on paper, was so intrigued by the Kindle when it arrived last week that she snatched it from my grasp. I haven't been able to pry it away from her since.
 I can see that the text looks splendid. But when one presses a bar to ''turn'' a page, the image reverses in a way I found jarring: the light background turns black and the black text turns white, then the new page appears and everything returns to normal. My wife said she wasn't bothered by this at all, and I didn't have enough of a chance to see if I would soon get used to it.
 Steven P. Jobs, the chief executive of Apple, has nothing to fear from the Kindle. No one would regard it as competition for the iPod. It displays text in four exciting shades of gray, and does that one thing very well. It can do a few other things: for instance, it has a headphone jack and can play MP3 files, but it is not well suited for navigating a large collection of music tracks. 
 Yet, when Mr. Jobs was asked two weeks ago at the Macworld Expo what he thought of the Kindle, he heaped scorn on the book industry. ''It doesn't matter how good or bad the product is; the fact is that people don't read anymore,'' he said. ''Forty percent of the people in the U.S. read one book or less last year.'' 
 To Mr. Jobs, this statistic dooms everyone in the book business to inevitable failure.
 Only the business is not as ghostly as he suggests. In 2008, book publishing will bring in about $15 billion in revenue in the United States, according to the Book Industry Study Group, a trade association. 
 One can only wonder why, by the Study Group's estimate, 408 million books will be bought this year if no one reads anymore? 
 A survey conducted in August 2007 by Ipsos Public Affairs for The Associated Press found that 27 percent of Americans had not read a book in the previous year. Not as bad as Mr. Jobs's figure, but dismaying to be sure. Happily, however, the same share -- 27 percent -- read 15 or more books. 
 In fact, when we exclude Americans who had not read a single book in that year, the average number of books read was 20, raised by the 8 percent who read 51 books or more. In other words, a sizable minority does not read, but the overall distribution is balanced somewhat by those who read a lot.
 If a piece of the book industry's $15 billion seems too paltry for Mr. Jobs to bother with, he is forgetting that Apple reached its current size only recently. Last week, Apple reported that it posted revenue of $9.6 billion in the quarter that spanned October to December 2007, its best quarter ever, after $24 billion in revenue in the 2007 fiscal year, which ended in September. 
 But as recently as 2001, before the iPhone and the iPod, Apple was a niche computer company without a mass market hit. It was badly hurt by the 2001 recession and reported revenue of only $5.3 billion for the year. This is, by coincidence, almost exactly what Barnes & Noble reported in revenue for its 2007 fiscal year. In neither case did the company owners look at that number, decide to chain the doors permanently shut and call it quits.
 Amazon does not release details about revenue for books, but books were its first business. And Andrew Herdener, a company spokesman, said that Amazon's book sales ''have increased every year since the company began.''
 The book world has always had an invisible asset that makes up for what it lacks in outsize revenue and profits: the passionate attachment that its authors, editors and most frequent customers have to books themselves. Indeed, in this respect, avid book readers resemble avid Mac users.
 The object we are accustomed to calling a book is undergoing a profound modification as it is stripped of its physical shell. Kindle's long-term success is still unknown, but Amazon should be credited with imaginatively redefining its original product line, replacing the book business with the reading business.

HEADLINE: The Age Of Ambition

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

DATELINE: DAVOS, Switzerland 

 BODY:
 With the American presidential campaign in full swing, the obvious way to change the world might seem to be through politics.
 But growing numbers of young people are leaping into the fray and doing the job themselves. These are the social entrepreneurs, the 21st-century answer to the student protesters of the 1960s, and they are some of the most interesting people here at the World Economic Forum (not only because they're half the age of everyone else).
 Andrew Klaber, a 26-year-old playing hooky from Harvard Business School to come here (don't tell his professors!), is an example of the social entrepreneur. He spent the summer after his sophomore year in college in Thailand and was aghast to see teenage girls being forced into prostitution after their parents had died of AIDS. 
 So he started Orphans Against AIDS (www.orphansagainstaids.org), which pays school-related expenses for hundreds of children who have been orphaned or otherwise affected by AIDS in poor countries. He and his friends volunteer their time and pay administrative costs out of their own pockets so that every penny goes to the children.
 Mr. Klaber was able to expand the nonprofit organization in Africa through introductions made by Jennifer Staple, who was a year ahead of him when they were in college. When she was a sophomore, Ms. Staple founded an organization in her dorm room to collect old reading glasses in the United States and ship them to poor countries. That group, Unite for Sight, has ballooned, and last year it provided eye care to 200,000 people (www.uniteforsight.org).
 In the '60s, perhaps the most remarkable Americans were the civil rights workers and antiwar protesters who started movements that transformed the country. In the 1980s, the most fascinating people were entrepreneurs like Steve Jobs and Bill Gates, who started companies and ended up revolutionizing the way we use technology.
 Today the most remarkable young people are the social entrepreneurs, those who see a problem in society and roll up their sleeves to address it in new ways. Bill Drayton, the chief executive of an organization called Ashoka that supports social entrepreneurs, likes to say that such people neither hand out fish nor teach people to fish; their aim is to revolutionize the fishing industry. If that sounds insanely ambitious, it is. John Elkington and Pamela Hartigan title their new book on social entrepreneurs ''The Power of Unreasonable People.''
 Universities are now offering classes in social entrepreneurship, and there are a growing number of role models. Wendy Kopp turned her thesis at Princeton into Teach for America and has had far more impact on schools than the average secretary of education.
 One of the social entrepreneurs here is Soraya Salti, a 37-year-old Jordanian woman who is trying to transform the Arab world by teaching entrepreneurship in schools. Her organization, Injaz, is now training 100,000 Arab students each year to find a market niche, construct a business plan and then launch and nurture a business.
 The program (www.injaz.org.jo) has spread to 12 Arab countries and is aiming to teach one million students a year. Ms. Salti argues that entrepreneurs can stimulate the economy, give young people a purpose and revitalize the Arab world. Girls in particular have flourished in the program, which has had excellent reviews and is getting support from the U.S. Agency for International Development. My hunch is that Ms. Salti will contribute more to stability and peace in the Middle East than any number of tanks in Iraq, U.N. resolutions or summit meetings.
 ''If you can capture the youth and change the way they think, then you can change the future,'' she said.
 Another young person on a mission is Ariel Zylbersztejn, a 27-year-old Mexican who founded and runs a company called Cinepop, which projects movies onto inflatable screens and shows them free in public parks. Mr. Zylbersztejn realized that 90 percent of Mexicans can't afford to go to movies, so he started his own business model: He sells sponsorships to companies to advertise to the thousands of viewers who come to watch the free entertainment. 
 Mr. Zylbersztejn works with microcredit agencies and social welfare groups to engage the families that come to his movies and help them start businesses or try other strategies to overcome poverty. Cinepop is only three years old, but already 250,000 people a year watch movies on his screens -- and his goal is to take the model to Brazil, India, China and other countries.
 So as we follow the presidential campaign, let's not forget that the winner isn't the only one who will shape the world. Only one person can become president of the United States, but there's no limit to the number of social entrepreneurs who can make this planet a better place.

HEADLINE: Loonie Economics In the N.H.L.

BYLINE: By JEFF Z. KLEIN and LEW SERVISS

 BODY:
A decade ago, the N.H.L.'s Canadian franchises were the league's economic weak links, with two teams leaving for the United States and at least half the remaining six close to insolvency.
 Now the skate is on the other foot. The Canadian clubs are worth more on average than the league's American clubs, according to estimates by Forbes magazine. And two Canadian teams are being sought for purchase by billionaires -- not to move them to the American Sun Belt, but because they are so lucrative where they are in Canada.
 The turnaround is largely because of the weakened United States dollar, which was worth about $1.50 Canadian throughout the 1990s and well into the 2000s, but is now at par. The increased relative value of the loonie, and the salary cap instituted in 2005 after the N.H.L. lockout, effectively increased the values of Canadian teams by nearly half. 
 The rank of the average Canadian team in Forbes's annual N.H.L. franchise valuation estimates was 21st among the league's 30 teams in 2001. It was 13th last year, and is 11th this year. 
 ''The exchange rate and the salary cap have both kept down costs for Canadian teams, because salaries are paid in U.S. dollars,'' said Drew Dorweiler of the Montreal valuation and accounting firm Wise, Blackman. ''That has led to a big and relatively sudden boost for Canadian teams.'' 
 According to Michael Rapkoch, the president of Sports Value Consulting, a Dallas company that advises professional franchises, ''In Canada, the fan base will always fill the arenas and get you big television ratings.'' That level of interest, he said, enables Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton and Ottawa to draw large audiences on club-owned pay-per-view channels and even for special showings in movie theaters.
 All this has led to big purchase bids. The Russian-Canadian steel magnate Alex Shnaider offered a reported $1.75 billion to buy the Toronto Maple Leafs and their properties earlier this month. Also this month, Daryl Katz, the chairman of one of North America's largest drugstore chains, offered $188 million to buy his hometown Edmonton Oilers, a team that 10 years ago was hours from moving to Houston.
 The new financial strength of Canadian teams is a far cry from the days when the Quebec Nordiques moved to Colorado and the Winnipeg Jets to Phoenix, and the N.H.L. instituted subsidies to Canadian teams to make up for currency differences. 
 Last year, the Nashville Predators came close to moving to Hamilton, Ontario. Dorweiler said that the next time an American Sun Belt team is in financial trouble, the talk may not be of a move to Kansas City or Seattle. ''A place like Hamilton or Winnipeg is now a very viable option,'' he said.
 A Neely in Training
 Milan Lucic, the Boston Bruins' punishing rookie left wing, was 8 when Cam Neely, the Bruins' punishing right wing, played his last game for Boston in 1996.
 Lucic, now a 6-foot-4, 220-pound 19-year-old, has enough offensive flair to go with his crash-and-bang instincts to remind many of a young Neely.
 ''He thinks about being physical first and foremost,'' said Neely, a Hall of Famer and now a Bruins vice president, ''and that's the path that I had when I played.''
 Lucic, the Vancouver-born son of Serbian immigrants, is third among rookies in hits (the Rangers' Brandon Dubinsky leads) and has gotten into nine fights. He has only five goals and six assists, but Lucic (pronounced LOO-cheech) has shown enough potential to be chosen for the Young Stars game during the All-Star weekend.
 He has also had the luxury of participating in a power-forward master class on the ice with Neely. They have worked on ''coming down the wall, protecting the puck, driving to the net,'' Lucic said, adding, ''He's been good with getting me to relax and play my game.''
 No Crosby, Extra Malkin
 It is a Pittsburgh Penguins tradition -- when a star goes down, another steps forward.
 A decade ago, it was Jaromir Jagr picking it up for Mario Lemieux. These days, it is Evgeni Malkin holding the fort while Sidney Crosby takes six to eight weeks to recover from a high ankle sprain.
 At 21, Malkin is a year older than Crosby and has a Calder Trophy as rookie of the year, an honor that eluded Crosby. The Penguins had won 9 of 10 games before Crosby was injured Jan. 18 and had climbed the Atlantic Division standings to challenge the Devils for first place.
 In the first two games after Crosby was sidelined, Malkin had an empty-net goal in a 2-0 victory over Montreal and two goals and an assist in a 6-5 shootout loss to the Washington Capitals.
 The Capitals star Alex Ovechkin, who eclipsed Crosby for the Calder in the 2005-6 season, also had two goals and an assist. But he was the one left sprawled on the ice when he tried to put a hit on Malkin behind the Washington net.
 Penguins Coach Michel Therrien said that Malkin was the team's leader offensively and that ''he wants to bring his teammates to another level with the loss of Sid.''
 Clash of Philosophies
 Last week's biggest showdown in the N.H.L. was on Wednesday in Anaheim, where the defending Stanley Cup champion Ducks played host to the team that is currently in first place over all, the Detroit Red Wings. 
 It was a clash of two big rivals -- the Ducks were the league's second-hottest team over the previous month, after Detroit, and of course they beat the Wings in last season's playoff semifinal, four games to two. 
 But it was also a clash of philosophies. The Ducks, whose roster is overwhelmingly Canadian and American, lead the league in fights this season and did so last season. Detroit, most of its key players European, has had the fewest fights over the last two seasons. 
 On Wednesday, the Red Wings jumped to a 2-0 lead on goals by Brian Rafalski and Valtteri Filppula, then held on to win, 2-1. They even fought the Ducks twice. 
 ''It's like you want to show who's the bigger, better team,'' Detroit forward Johan Franzen said afterward. ''We stood up good. It was a lot of fun.''

CORRECTION-DATE: January 31, 2008

 CORRECTION:
A report in the Slap Shot column on Sunday about the growing worth of Canadian N.H.L. franchises referred imprecisely to the interest of Alex Shnaider, a steel magnate, in buying the Toronto Maple Leafs and their properties. Although he is said to have expressed interest, and a price of $1.75 billion has been reported, Mr. Shnaider has not made such an offer.

HEADLINE: Where Charming Buildings Housed Horses

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER GRAY. 
E-mail: streetscapes@nytimes.com

 BODY:
THREE decades ago, at nighttime on West 18th Street between the Avenue of the Americas and Seventh Avenue, there weren't even enough people to get up a poker game. After the box makers and plumbers and electrical suppliers all went home, the street was empty. Now, as this street full of old stables evolves, it is home to not one but two huge party spaces, with a total of 60,000 square feet. 
 This low-slung, sunny block is memorable for the charming two-story buildings on the south side, originally private stables. They survive intermittently from 126 through 140 West 18th, part of a longer row built beginning in 1864, nearly identical structures designed with the same curved-arch facades but put up by different people. 
 According to research by Gale Harris of the Landmarks Preservation Commission, the first in the group were Nos. 122, 124 and 126, built by Elisha Brooks, a partner in the Brooks Brothers clothing store. He lived on 16th Street off Fifth Avenue at the time, and kept No. 122 for his own use. No. 124 he sold to his brother John, and No. 126 -- today the sole survivor of the three -- he sold to Thomas Vyse, a straw-goods dealer who lived on 17th Street off Fifth. 
 The entire row, stretching from 122 through 146, were among the 500 stables listed in the 1869 city directory. Coachmen typically lived with their families above the stable, perhaps also with a groom or two -- and a quick check of the names in the directory suggests that the Irish were talented at the reins.
 Horses were still an essential part of the New York economy: in 1872 The New York Times reported a mysterious plague, perhaps distemper, sweeping through stables in Manhattan and Brooklyn. Several dozen horses died on a single day in October, including one at 132 West 18th, which at that time was the stable of Nathaniel McCready, a steamship operator and railroad investor who lived on 22nd Street. 
 Because of the illness, deliveries of coal, ice and other goods were curtailed; garbage pickup was reduced; and the horse-drawn streetcars in Manhattan were operating barely a quarter of their fleet. 
 The rich family's stable, with expensive coaches, tack and horses, required trained labor. On May 23, 1880, The Times carried an advertisement from a ''respectable'' coachman seeking work, who had ''been in the Royal Artillery five years'' and had the ''best testimonials.'' The ad asked inquirers to call at 130 West 28th Street. On June 3 of that year, the census recorded the occupants of No. 130 as the Irish-born William Spence, 43, a coachman; his English-born wife, Susanna; and their son and four daughters. 
 By the 1890s, although many town-house owners had moved farther north, this block of West 18th Street remained in the stable business. In 1896, the B. Altman department store on Sixth Avenue built a five-story stable for its delivery fleet at No. 135. 
 After 1900, a wider span of businesses moved in. Charles Hellmuth, who made printers' ink, built a fairly typical factory building at No. 154 in 1906, designed by Adolph Schoeller. What sets the Hellmuth Building apart -- indeed far apart -- are the heavily molded terra-cotta ledges over the doorways. Cushionlike brackets with oozing Art Nouveau floral forms flank central panels with Hellmuth Building in otherworldly lettering, with the L's overlaid. 
 By the mid-20th century, 18th Street was full of metal fabricators, electrical-supply stores, plumbers and similar operations. While it still has businesses like the venerable Nagel Roofing, established in 1919 and now in the old stable at No. 128, there are also new arrivals, like Michael Aram, whose handmade metalwork is on display at No. 136.
 Today, the street is in the midst of a new transition, and the two big buildings on the north side of the block are leading the way. In 1998, the old B. Altman stable became the Altman Building, an event space with 15,000 square feet just inside the big old arched doorways. Lacoste recently had a fashion show and reception there, and scores of people spilled out carrying canvas tote bags emblazoned with its crocodile trademark. 
 A similar business established on 19th Street by the entrepreneur Alan Boss in 1992 was expanded through the block, to 125 West 18th Street, in 1999. Called the Metropolitan Pavilion and offering 45,000 square feet of space, it is next door to the Altman Building, and the two businesses have used this to their advantage, connecting the buildings for use as one mega-event space. 
 Mr. Boss started a flea market on the Avenue of the Americas in 1976, when the big old department stores there were like derelict ocean liners littering some far-off shore. He lived nearby and remembers the area as desolate. ''If I hadn't had dogs, I wouldn't have gone out at night,'' he said. 
 Now, where stables once stood on West 18th Street, he can barely keep up with the demand for event bookings. ''We're turning business away,'' he said.

HEADLINE: An Ear To the Ground On Stocks

BYLINE: By MARK HULBERT. 
Mark Hulbert is editor of The Hulbert Financial Digest, a service of MarketWatch. E-mail: strategy@nytimes.com

 BODY:
INVESTOR sentiment suggests that the bulk of the stock market's decline is now behind us. 
 This conclusion is based on an analysis of two very different groups. The first is investment newsletter editors, who, on average, are usually wrong about the market's direction; they are currently bearish. The second is corporate insiders, who usually get it right, and they are mostly bullish.
 The newsletter editors, as a group, have an inglorious track record that makes them excellent contrarian indicators. When they become too bullish, it is generally a bad sign for the stock market, just as it is a positive omen when they become particularly pessimistic. Right now, the average market-timing newsletter is betting that the market will decline. 
 Consider a subset of investment newsletters that focuses on timing the market's shorter-term gyrations. According to data collected by The Hulbert Financial Digest, which I edit, and which has been tracking newsletter sentiment for 28 years, this subset's average recommended stock-market exposure currently stands at minus 1 percent. This means that the average market-timing newsletter is recommending that its clients allocate 1 percent of their equity portfolios to going short -- an aggressive bet on lower prices.
 From the standpoint of contrarian analysis, another positive sign is the speed at which these newsletters have turned bearish. The typical pattern immediately after major market tops is for the editors to cling stubbornly to bullishness, refusing to believe that the market has turned. This isn't what has happened since the market hit its high in early October. At that time, the average recommended equity exposure among the short-term market-timing newsletters was 46.7 percent. That means that in just three and a half months, this average has fallen by nearly 48 percentage points.
 To put this rapid retreat in perspective, note that newsletter editors reacted very differently after the bursting of the Internet bubble in March 2000. Three and a half months into the bear market that began then, the average recommended exposure among the short-term market-timing newsletters was actually higher than it was at the market top. That persistent optimism was far from the pessimism we're seeing today. 
 On the other hand, the insiders in the second group have tended to be more right than wrong about the market's direction. It stands to reason that these officers, directors and largest shareholders of publicly traded corporations have some insight into their companies' prospects. They are required to report immediately to the Securities and Exchange Commission whenever they have bought or sold shares of their companies' stocks. 
 ONE service that collects and analyzes these reported transactions is Argus Research in New York. According to the firm, insiders are now behaving more bullishly than at any time since November 2002, the month after the end of the 2000-2002 bear market.
 One statistic that Argus calculates is a ratio of insider selling to insider buying, which has averaged around 2.5 to 1 over the long term. Insiders often receive shares from their companies as part of their compensation; it is therefore quite normal for them to sell more shares than they buy. 
 For insider transactions in the week ended Jan. 18, the latest for which data are available, the insider sell-to-buy ratio was 0.89 to 1, according to Argus. Not only is that far lower than the historical norm, it also means that insiders actually bought more than they sold. They wouldn't be likely to do that if they believed that the stock market was about to suffer significant losses. 
 The week-to-week readings of the Argus ratio are volatile, so the firm also calculates an eight-week moving average, and its most recent reading was 1.44 to 1. The last time it was any lower was for the eight weeks ended Nov. 15, 2002, when it was 1.33 to 1. As David Coleman, editor of the Argus publication Vickers Weekly Insider Report, wrote: ''Shortly after that was achieved back in 2002, the markets embarked on a five-year bull run.''
 Needless to say, there are no guarantees that the stock market will perform as well over the next five years. But to bet that the market will fall markedly further from here, one must essentially be betting that the newsletter editors who usually are wrong will have it right this time, and that the insiders, who usually are right, will be wrong.

HEADLINE: Beyond the Stimulus Package

 BODY:
All the talk in Washington in the last few days about the $150 billion economic stimulus plan agreed to by the White House and the House obscures a vitally important and very worrisome fact. 
 The current slowdown is layered on top of deep-rooted economic problems that are not addressed by a stimulus package. If the nation's leaders do not start showing the political will to do more than dole out popular tax breaks during an election year, short-term fixes could actually make the long-term problems worse.
 In the plan agreed to Thursday, the administration's worst ideas, including a push to deny tax rebates to lower-income Americans, were ditched. Money will reach many of the cash-strapped people most likely to spend it.
 Unfortunately, bolstered spending for unemployment benefits and food stamps was also omitted from the plan, in favor of granting businesses outsized tax writeoffs for new investments. That is a blunder because direct relief spending is a more powerful stimulus than business tax breaks, and is better aimed at the neediest. Worse, short-shrifting the jobless and the poor now virtually guarantees that if the economy continues to deteriorate, policy makers will be forced to provide more relief later, driving up the total cost of the stimulus. 
 Therein lies the bigger problem. Coming to the rescue -- whether handing out money or extending jobless benefits -- is the easiest thing for any politician to do. The real art and skill of fiscal stimulus is to boost the economy as much as possible in the near term without weakening its long-term prospects. 
 A package that creates the potential need for continued relief down the line sets the stage for long-term budget problems, not for a healthy recovery. 
 Stimulus is necessary. But the flip side of fiscal stimulus is fiscal tightening. The economic crises of the moment are built on seven years of Bush-era tax-cut-and-spend policies, which made for worsening budget prospects even before the current slowdown. 
 According to the Congressional Budget Office, if the nation keeps on the path it is on, federal debt will exceed the size of the economy in the lifetimes of many people reading this editorial, and certainly within their children's lifetimes. Approaching a debt load that large would slam the brakes on economic activity, making today's slowdown look benign. How lawmakers -- and candidates -- act and communicate now will send a signal of their ability to see us not only through the current turmoil but to a more stable future. So far, the signals are about how much they want to dole out. 
 To be effective leaders, politicians also need to explain that stimulus -- which promotes spending -- is the opposite of what is needed long term. Going forward, the nation must increase savings, not consumption. That will be painful. 
 Higher private savings requires delayed gratification by individuals. Higher government savings requires higher taxes or reduced government benefits, or a combination of both. Yet, savings, which have been neglected as a policy imperative throughout the Bush years, are the only means of ultimately digging out of the hole the nation is in already, even before the extent of the slowdown is known. 
 Our immediate problem -- how to best use stimulus to buoy spending -- is the easy part.

Why do presidential candidates touting their concern for the economy pose with factory workers rather than with ballet troupes? After all, the U.S. now has more choreographers (16,340) than metal-casters (14,880), according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. More people make their livings shuffling and dealing cards in casinos (82,960) than running lathes (65,840), and there are almost three times as many security guards (1,004,130) as machinists (385,690). Whereas 30 percent of Americans worked in manufacturing in 1950, fewer than 15 percent do now. The economy as politicians present it is a folkloric thing.
 If Republicans have had more luck talking about the economy for the last generation or so, it is because they were the less folkloric of the two parties. Broadly speaking, they cut taxes and regulation and trusted that entrepreneurs would hasten the arrival of the economy to come. There were Democrats who did the same, but they shared a party with others who were nostalgic for a disappearing world, reflexively backing unions and fighting management. Republican optimism beat Democratic nostalgia. 
 This campaign season, Republicans no longer look so confident. Mike Huckabee suggested to a group of Detroit executives that ''instead of talking to people in the corporate boardroom, you talk to people on the line.'' He aspires to remind Americans ''of the guy they work with, not the guy who laid them off.'' The latter guy, in Huckabee's view, resembles Mitt Romney, who may have triumphed in Michigan, but only after promising to restore 250,000 factory jobs lost to layoffs. Republican rhetoric about trusting the transition to a new economy is not allaying fears as it once did. 
 The reason is simple. It is that the transition is over. The new economy we have been promised is in place. While the economy of 1998 was a world away from the Internet-less, land-line-dependent, non-Nafta, I.B.M.-Selectric-powered, partly Communist world of 1988, today's economy is fully recognizable as the one we inhabited in 1998. 
 Today's economic anxiety is not the same anxiety that simmered between 1980 and 2000. Back then, recessions and slowdowns were understood as the pangs of a new economy struggling to be born. But the recession we now seem to be entering is to the information age what the recession of, say, 1957-1958 was to the industrial age -- a ''normal'' recession in the midst of an economy with stable bases, an economy that (to use a current cliche) ''is what it is.'' The ''jobs of the future'' that were promised 20 years ago are here. Choreographers, blackjack dealers and security guards have replaced factory workers as the economy's backbone, if not yet its symbol. 
 New economies have always required a kind of initiation fee of those who would participate fully in them. As the historian Richard Hofstadter showed in ''The Age of Reform,'' the aftermath of the Civil War was marked by paeans to the prosperity that would arise from technological change. The 19th-century farmer went to great lengths to join it. ''His demand for expensive machinery,'' Hofstadter wrote, ''his expectation of higher standards of living and his tendency to go into debt to acquire extensive acreage created an urgent need for cash and tempted the farmer into capitalizing more and more on his greatest single asset: the unearned appreciation in the value of his land.'' These problems will be familiar to many a 21st-century security guard or Wal-Mart cashier. They are the problems not of someone ''left behind'' in the old economy but of someone struggling in the new. 
 Economic orders have life cycles. Policies designed to ''unleash'' business in a fledgling economy offer diminishing returns in a developed one. To have overregulated or overtaxed Bill Gates 20 years ago might have killed a goose that still had many golden eggs to lay. But it seems probable that 20 years hence, regardless of tax policy, Microsoft will be intact, thriving, based in the United States and doing roughly what it is doing now. 
 Yet Republican prescriptions have changed not a whit. Mitt Romney recently attacked the latest federal energy bill, which mandates average fuel-efficiency of 35 miles per gallon, as an impediment to Detroit's ability to crank out sport-utility vehicles. He is quite right. But does he mean to say we're going to get out of our economic doldrums by driving 10-mile-a-gallon cars in a world of $100-a-barrel oil? 
 All Republican candidates want to make President Bush's deep tax cuts permanent, and even to expand on them. Rudolph Giuliani has promised to pass the largest tax cut in U.S. history. But this is yesterday's policy trying to pass itself off as tomorrow's. Americans are evenly split on whether taxes ought to be raised back to pre-Bush levels. Large majorities would gladly pay more in taxes for various purposes (notably more access to health care). Voters, it seems, have begun asking of entrepreneurs and their champions what they asked of hippies around 1971: Aren't you liberated enough already?
 Cutting taxes and slashing regulations were appropriate strategies for managing a transitional economy. But we no longer live in such an economy. This does not mean that Republicans need to embrace a single-payer health system or subsidized day care. But neither can they go on automatically favoring the hypothetical needs of tomorrow's entrepreneurs over the real needs of today's dental hygienists and landscape gardeners. The future is now, as the late Redskins' coach George Allen used to say. The promise that prosperity is just one more tax cut or one more rescinded regulation away is a rapidly depreciating rhetorical asset.

HEADLINE: Tightening the Alligator Belt

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE ROSENBLOOM

 BODY:
EVEN Dobbins, the teacup Yorkie, has to downsize. 
 Its owner, Betsy Illium, recently replaced the groomer who specializes in little dogs (and charges about $130) with one from Petco, which charges $65. 
 Ms. Illium, a marketing consultant to medical practices and the owner of four Manhattan apartments (three are investment properties), is fortunate enough to have discretionary income. But the dreary economic outlook has prompted her and Dobbins to scale back. 
 ''It's frightening,'' said Ms. Illium, 45, noting that most of her money is tied up in real estate.
 She was appalled when she calculated that Dobbins's grooming along with her own weekly hair, nail and massage appointments; gourmet groceries; restaurant meals and Starbucks coffee cost nearly $2,000 a month. 
 Now she gets manicures at a less expensive salon, meets her friends at California Pizza Kitchen and sends her sheets and towels to a laundry service instead of the dry cleaner. 
 These services might be considered luxuries in some cities, but they are frequently deemed necessities in New York City. Rather than do without, many residents like Ms. Illium -- who are not in dire financial straits -- are looking critically at their spending. 
 And that decision, marketing scholars and consumer psychologists say, is telling. They suggest that for consumers with disposable income, the act of pinching pennies on everything from toilet paper to yoga classes has less to do with actually saving money and more to do with emotional health.
 Sure, being thrifty can help people save a few thousand dollars a year, but it can also help them regain some sense of control when the world seems topsy-turvy -- with stock markets around the world falling last week, brokerage firms announcing billion-dollar losses and those ubiquitous For Sale signs. 
 Yet when these dollar-stretching consumers cut back, they do so in ways that make them feel good and enable them to maintain their status.
 Robert Meyer, the chairman of the marketing department at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, does research in areas that include decision making under uncertainty. He likened the daily saving process to ''a kind of healing process.'' 
 ''They're seeing all this news media saying the value of your house has gone down, the value of your portfolio has gone down,'' he said. ''Well, none of it is relative to their day-to-day spending. Nevertheless it creates a feeling of poverty, which feels bad. The way they can undo that is their daily savings perks, which make them feel richer.'' 
 This why people are choosing to be thrifty about visible, routine expenses, he said. ''People aren't doing it really because they're saving money.'' And by cutting corners, he said, ''you're not actually depriving yourself in any way, so you kind of have the best of both worlds.''
 Larry D. Compeau, an associate professor of marketing at Clarkson University and the executive officer of the American Psychological Association Society for Consumer Psychology, agreed, explaining that such behavior is really ''a symbolic tightening of the belt'' that enables consumers to feel prudent and responsible.
 ''This is how people who are not fighting paycheck to paycheck can feel they're doing something,'' he said. (Though he pointed out that people may be pulling back only slightly because they are not feeling a downturn.)
 In this way, people in New York are not that different from people in other cities. Mr. Compeau said that in other parts of the country people may not be looking for cheaper places to send their dirty sheets, but they are buying less expensive bread and skipping dessert. ''It's the same type of thing, and that's why we all get nervous when consumers start pulling back,'' he said. 
 The pruning of daily expenditures could have a butterfly effect, setting off a chain of events that actually contributes to an economic slide -- and more fear. And increased fear, said consumer psychologists, could lead to further belt tightening.
 Indeed, retail sales were down over the holidays, leading economists to debate whether the country could experience a rare decline in personal consumption. And consumer confidence has plunged. The Pew Research Center says its polling shows that consumer satisfaction with the economy has reached a 15-year low. 
 ''If that fear gets greater they'll probably do more,'' Mr. Compeau said. ''When they're actually telling you 'I'm cutting my coffee bill in half,' Starbucks is going to feel that.''
 Lisa Germinsky, 33, a screenwriter who lives in Gramercy, has just begun to trim back. ''My boyfriend and I, we were talking and he's just like doom and gloom, 'impending recession,' his stocks dropping,'' she said. ''And I'm a freelancer, so I'm like, 'Oh, my God.' ''
 She has resolved to travel from Manhattan to her former hair colorist in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, because a single-process color there is $40 ($44, factoring in the round-trip subway ride) instead of $100 or $130, which she paid at a Manhattan salon. And the Greenpoint salon is not teeming with assistants requiring tips. 
 Last week she went on the Internet to see whether she could buy a tea-based fermented drink known as kombucha (her preferred beverage) by the case. 
 And? 
 ''I stopped looking because I thought I really better get to work or I won't be able to buy any kombucha,'' she said. 
 Joe Priester, an associate professor of marketing at the Marshall School of Business at the University of Southern California and the president of the Society for Consumer Psychology, is not surprised people scale back instead of abandon certain habits. ''In a way, a lot of these brands have become safe harbors for us,'' he said. ''People build attachments to brands over time, and those are very much like friendships or buffering devices in our world. You don't hear people saying, 'I'm not going to Starbucks.' It would be like saying 'I'm going to cut off this friend.' '' 
 In a working paper under peer review, Mr. Priester and colleagues write that ''consumers see brands as part of themselves'' and the greater the attachment to the brand, ''the more difficult the behavior the consumer is willing to enact in order to maintain the brand relationship.''
 Additionally, Jeff Greenberg, the director of the social psychology program at the University of Arizona, explained in an e-mail message that frugality ''will generally be with regard to products and services that don't undermine the individual's material bases of self-worth and prestige. If a person's self-worth is invested in his/her car, wardrobe, apartment, ability to send their kids to private school, etc., they will cut corners in relatively invisible ways that don't affect their self-worth to preserve those things.''
 Or as Rachel LeMaster, 29, a grade-school music teacher who lives in Washington Heights, put it: ''A lot of what you spend goes toward showing other people what you have.'' 
 She still gets a massage once a month ($40 for 46 minutes) and spends money on her hair (''hair is worth the money''), but she too has reduced her spending: cooking with friends, only buying paper goods on sale, tempering her hair product demands and scouring the Village Voice for local artists playing free concerts. 
 Lena Datwani, a real estate agent who lives in Midtown with her husband and children, is thinking about the fact that her daughter is only five months away from college. She still orders take-out food, but less frequently and the family picks it up. Their cleaning lady comes once, not twice, a week. They clip coupons and drive to New Jersey to visit family and shop in bulk at Costco and BJ's Wholesale Club. 
 Patrick Kiely pays $700 a month (utilities and cable included) for an apartment in Woodlawn, the Bronx (a fire left him bereft of his rent-controlled one-bedroom sublet on the Upper East Side that was $750). ''But it's the Bronx,'' said Mr. Kiely, 32, who works for an environmental group. ''It does put a damper on the social life at times.'' 
 Even with his low housing costs, Mr. Kiely rents fewer DVDs, borrows books from the library and reads the news online. 
 ''The newspaper,'' he said, ''I never buy it anymore.''

HEADLINE: A Dying Breed

BYLINE: By ANDREW RICE. 
Andrew Rice, a contributing writer for the magazine, is writing a book about the legacy of the Ugandan dictator, Idi Amin.

 BODY:
GERSHOM MUGIRA COMES from a long line of cattle-keepers. His people, the Bahima, are thought to have migrated into the hilly grasslands of western Uganda more than a thousand years ago, alongside a hardy breed of longhorns known as the Ankole. For centuries, man and beast subsisted there in a tight symbiotic embrace. Mugira's nomadic ancestors wandered in search of fresh pasture for their cattle, which in turn provided them with milk. It is only within the last few generations that most Bahima have accepted the concept of private property. Mugira's family lives on a 500-acre ranch, and one sunny day in November, the wiry 26-year-old showed me around, explaining, with some sadness but more pragmatism, why the Ankole breed that sustained his forebears for so many generations is now being driven to extinction.
 As we walked down the sloped valley path that led to a watering hole, we found a few cows lolling beneath a flat-topped acacia. They looked like the kind of cattle you might encounter in Wisconsin: plump and hornless creatures with dappled black-and-white coats. Mugira, a high-school graduate, was wearing a pair of fashionably baggy jeans and spiffy white sneakers. To a modern African like himself, he said, the most desirable cattle were the American type: the Holsteins. 
 In recent decades, global trade, sophisticated marketing, artificial insemination and the demands of agricultural economics have transformed the Holstein into the world's predominant dairy breed. Indigenous animals like East Africa's sinewy Ankole, the product of centuries of selection for traits adapted to harsh conditions, are struggling to compete with foreign imports bred for maximal production. This worries some scientists. The world's food supply is increasingly dependent on a small and narrowing list of highly engineered breeds: the Holstein, the Large White pig and the Rhode Island Red and Leghorn chickens. There's a risk that future diseases could ravage these homogeneous animal populations. Poor countries, which possess much of the world's vanishing biodiversity, may also be discarding breeds that possess undiscovered genetic advantages. But farmers like Mugira say they can't afford to wait for science. And so, on the African savanna, a competition for survival is underway.
 Mugira was just about to tell me what made the Holsteins so valuable when suddenly, Dr. Grace Asiimwe, a veterinarian and my guide through western Uganda's ranchlands, shouted, ''The Ankoles are coming!''
 In the distance, I glimpsed a bobbing line of white horns swooping down the hillside. Without a word, Mugira dashed down the dirt path, hopped over a fallen tree branch and disappeared around the side of a huge weed-covered anthill. ''He has to keep them separated,'' Asiimwe told me, lest the Ankoles gore the Holsteins. We found Mugira by the watering hole, whistling and waving a wooden switch called an enkoni, frantically trying to keep his Ankoles away. His herdsmen were supposed to bring the two contingents to the water at different times, but someone made a mistake.
 ''You know, in Uganda, we have to look for survival of the fittest,'' Mugira said once he finished sorting out the confusion. ''These ones, they are the fittest,'' he went on to say, gesturing toward his Holsteins. In physical terms, there was really no contest between the tough Ankoles and the fussy foreign cattle, which were always hungry and often sick. But the foreigners possessed arguably the single most important adaptive trait for livestock: they made money. Holsteins are lactating behemoths. In an African setting, a good one can produce 20 or 30 times as much milk as an Ankole.
 Mugira explained that, unlike most of his peers, he was holding onto some longhorns, mostly for sentimental reasons. His father, who died in 2003, loved his Ankoles. One of them wandered over and nuzzled Mugira, who placed his hand gently on its forehead. In the days before Christianity arrived in this part of Africa, the Bahima made offerings of milk to herdsman gods. Their language contains a vast catalog of cattle names, which refer to characteristics like color and hide pattern. This cow was called Kiroko, indicating it had some white patches on its face. The ideal Ankole, Mugira told me, has a lustrous brown coat and gleaming horns that curve out and then inward, forming a shape like a lyre. ''They are naturally good,'' Mugira said. ''They are beautiful. In our culture we preferred these. But then we developed another culture, from Western culture.''
 The Food and Agriculture Organization, an agency of the United Nations, recently reported that at least 20 percent of the world's estimated 7,600 livestock breeds are in danger of extinction. Experts are warning of a potential ''meltdown'' in global genetic diversity. Yet the plight of the Ankole illustrates the difficulty of balancing the conflicting goals of animal conservation and human prosperity. An estimated 70 percent of the world's rural poor, some 630 million people, derive a substantial percentage of their income from livestock. Increase the productivity of these animals, development specialists say, and you improve dire living standards. The World Bank recently published a report saying it was time to place farming ''afresh at the center of the development agenda.'' Highly productive livestock breeds, the World Bank asserts, are playing an important role in alleviating poverty.
 ''You do have local animals with various kinds of disease resistance and whatever other kinds of things you don't want to do away with,'' said Chris Delgado, an agriculture policy adviser at the World Bank. ''But there's a problem: They are kept by very poor people, and they don't want to stay poor.''
 Every cow in the world is the product of some human agency. The extinct feral ancestor of all cattle, the auroch, was a fearsome horned creature that could grow to be six feet tall. There are two theories about the taming of wild aurochs. The traditional view holds that it happened around 6000 B.C. in the Fertile Crescent. But recent archaeological and genetic evidence suggests that domestication may have first occurred in Africa 2,000 years earlier, in the then-lush plains of the eastern Sahara. Then, beginning around 2,000 years ago, Arab merchants introduced humped cattle of Indian origin to East Africa, which were crossed with the indigenous longhorns to produce breeds like the Ankole.
 For millennia, changing a breed's genetics through husbandry required a long trial-and-error process. But today it can happen in an evolutionary eye blink. Multinational breeding companies, many of them based in the United States, collect semen from prime bulls, freeze it and export it to the developing world. Official estimates say there are about three million Ankole cattle in Uganda and smaller populations in bordering nations. An unknown -- though by all accounts large -- percentage of them are in the process of being turned into something else. After one cross with a Holstein, the brown Ankole cow will produce a black calf with darkened horns. After two, the horns will shrink and a dappled coat will appear. The third generation will basically look like American dairy cattle. With each cross, the offspring will produce more milk. The World Bank estimates that 1.8 million small-scale farmers in East Africa are benefiting from such genetic changes to their cattle and that some 100 million cows and pigs are created through artificial insemination in poor countries each year. Those numbers substantially understate the extent of genetic interchange, because half the offspring produced by artificial insemination are male and spread their genes the old-fashioned way. 
 To see the evolution in Ugandan dairy cattle, I visited a farmer named Jackson Sezibwa, who lives down a reddish dirt path outside the central Ugandan town of Mukono. A weather-beaten man of 46, Sezibwa greeted me in a torn, muddy shirt. He showed me to the metal-roofed stall where he keeps his Holstein, Kevina. 
 Before he received the cow, Sezibwa said, he was hungry and destitute. All he owned were some banana trees and a one-room house roofed with thatch. Then he and his wife were given Kevina by a charity called Heifer International. Founded in 1944 by Dan West, an Indiana farmer, Heifer's mission is to take quality livestock to impoverished places. In Uganda, the cattle breed Heifer prefers is the Holstein. ''The American cow,'' said Dr. Margaret Makuru, Heifer's deputy country director, ''once you feed it, it is a factory.''
 Like any factory owner, Jackson Sezibwa had to think about inputs and outputs. Making milk requires energy, which means eating grass. Holsteins require much more grass than Ankole cattle, but unlike Ankoles, which need to roam, Holsteins can be kept in pens. Sezibwa owned just a small plot of land, so the Holstein was perfect for him. All day long, Sezibwa refilled Kevina's trough with feed, a mixture of elephant grass and protein-rich leaves and legumes that he grew in his field. Each time he milked the cow, he fed her a store-bought meal full of nutrients. Otherwise, his largest expense was medicine. Holsteins originated in Northern Europe and were taken to America in the 19th century. They don't have any resistance to tropical diseases like trypanosomiasis -- colloquially known as sleeping sickness -- and East Coast Fever, which is spread by ticks.
 With intense maintenance, Sezibwa's cow functioned marvelously. Kevina churned out around six and a half gallons of milk a day. (A typical Ankole would have given him between a quarter and a half gallon.) His family drank some of the milk, and he sold the rest, netting around $100 a month after expenses. In a country where an estimated 85 percent of the population lives on less than $1 a day, that's substantial income. The money finances school for Sezibwa's six children. There were ancillary benefits too. Kevina was impregnated four times via artificial insemination. Sezibwa gave away her first calf to a neighbor, in keeping with Heifer's philosophy of ''passing the gift.'' The next two -- both males -- he sold to farmers eager to acquire Holstein genetics, making enough profit to build himself a nice brick house. He kept the fourth calf, another female, for the future. Heifer also paid to install an underground system that harnessed methane from the cows' manure to power gas burners and a light inside his house.
 Jackson Sezibwa is just one man, but Uganda's economy is made up of millions like him. Agriculture accounts for 30 percent of the country's gross domestic product, and 10 percent of that comes from the livestock sector. The World Bank's October report claimed that ''G.D.P. growth originating in agriculture is at least twice as effective in reducing poverty'' as other types of growth. The report pointed out that the industrialization of Europe and North America that began in the late 18th century was preceded by a period of farming innovation, and that the Green Revolution that took place between the 1940s and 1960s catalyzed Asia's fantastic economic growth.
 During the Green Revolution, scientists invented high-yielding strains of corn, wheat and rice and planted them around the third world, and they also promoted the introduction of better livestock. But then, broadly speaking, foreign-aid donors moved away from such interventions, which were viewed as meddling with the free market, and shifted financing priorities to areas like education and AIDS. Today, even after recent increases, the World Bank devotes less than 10 percent of its development assistance to agriculture, down from 30 percent a quarter-century ago. Recently, the notion of helping poor farmers by making farming more lucrative has been dusted off by a new generation of economists. And Bill Gates and the Rockefeller Foundation have promised to finance a second Green Revolution. But governmental aid agencies have been slower to rediscover the importance of agriculture. Farming initiatives now account for just 4 percent of the assistance distributed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of the world's most developed nations.
 The U.S. Agency for International Development budgeted $392 million for agricultural programs last year, including a significant proportion to promote milk production. Crossbreeding is an important component of its strategy. In Uganda, where the agency recently completed a five-year, $8 million dairy-modernization project, about half the money went toward artificial insemination. One partner in the program was Land O'Lakes International Development, the aid arm of the Minnesota butter company. ''We should be able to do farming as a business, not sentimentally,'' said Dr. Paul Kimbugwe, the Land O'Lakes country manager. ''Making money means you have to crossbreed. And crossbreeding means that you are doing away with the genetics of that cow,'' meaning the Ankole, ''which I also encourage.''
 Not everyone in Uganda, however, agrees that the foreign breeds are an upgrade. President Yoweri Museveni once imposed a ban on imported semen. Museveni belongs to the Bahima ethnic group. When he was a baby, in a sort of Bahima baptism ritual, his parents placed him on the back of an Ankole cow with a mock bow and arrow, as if to commit him symbolically to the defense of the family's herd. Museveni, now in his 60s, still owns the descendants of that very cow, and he retains a strong bond to the Ankole breed. Two years ago, I accompanied a group of Ugandan journalists on a daylong trip to one of the president's private ranches, where he proudly showed us his 4,000-strong herd of Ankole cattle. At one point, a reporter asked if the ranch had any Holsteins. ''No, those are pollution,'' Museveni replied. ''These,'' he said, referring to his Ankoles, ''the genetic material is superior.''
 If the Ankole cattle are able to mount a comeback, it will be because circumstances have endowed them with a unique set of defenses, both evolutionary and political. Members of President Museveni's ethnic group populate the upper ranks of Uganda's government. Some prominent Bahima have started an organization devoted to preserving Ankoles, under the patronage of a one-eyed army general who spends his free time painting rapturous portraits of cows. One afternoon, at a pricey restaurant in Kampala, I had lunch with the organization's chairman, Samuel Mugasi. Dressed in a dapper gray suit and a French-cuffed pale blue shirt, he told me he was a civil servant and part-time rancher. 
 ''They have tasted the money,'' Mugasi said of the farmers who switched to Holsteins. ''They are excited about having these big earnings, and they are forgetting the cultural aspect.''
 Kimbugwe, the Land O'Lakes representative, has a ready reply to such arguments. ''Culture -- fine, it's good to have,'' he said. ''But first, the stomachs.'' He views the Ankole as an atavistic indulgence for the country's elite. Once, cattle were like currency, and the wealthy displayed their status by maintaining huge free-ranging herds. Competition for land is forcing cows onto smaller pastures. Uganda has one of the highest birth rates in the world, and despite its poverty and diseases like AIDS, the population has more than doubled since 1980. There's a long history of tension between the Bahima and an agriculturalist ethnic group, the Bairu, which coexist in western Uganda, at times less than happily. 
 This is a common dynamic across Africa. In Rwanda, a similar ethnic conflict between cattle-keeping Tutsis and farming Hutus culminated in genocide in 1994. A number of experts say the ''ethnic'' war in Darfur is really a fight over grass. Uganda has not experienced that level of conflict, but the local newspapers are filled with stories of violent skirmishes between farmers and encroaching pastoralists. This is one reason that some say Holsteins represent the future. Rwanda, now ruled by longhorn-loving Tutsis but trying to address the causes of the genocide, is enthusiastically encouraging the breed's introduction, with assistance from the U.S. Agency for International Development.
 One of the biggest dairy farmers in western Uganda, Kezekia Rwabuhenda, told me he was the first person in his area to adopt Holsteins, back in the 1970s. At the time, he said, many traditionalists maligned him, saying he was conspiring to ''slaughter'' the cattle they loved. ''Afterwards, when they realized what the cross was producing, they started visiting me, asking for a bull,'' he said through a translator. The elderly rancher still kept a hundred Ankoles, but they were for his wife, who was attached to them. He was sure that when he died, his children would dispatch them all to the butcher shop.
 No one knows how many Ankole cattle exist. ''We've been saying the Ankoles are 50 percent of the national herd, but I don't think that's true anymore,'' said Dr. Denis Mpairwe, an animal scientist at Uganda's Makerere University. ''The crossbreeding the last five years has been so intense.'' The International Livestock Research Institute predicts that if present trends continue, the Ankoles could go extinct within 50 years. But Mpairwe says he believes it could happen much sooner. 
 I went with Mpairwe to visit Uganda's cattle country earlier this fall, along with Dr. Okeyo Mwai, a Kenyan biotechnology specialist who works for the livestock institute. I lived in Uganda between 2002 and 2004, and I couldn't believe the change. Hillsides where graceful brown Ankoles once grazed by the hundreds were now dotted black and white. ''Look at the calves,'' Mwai said, as our pickup truck passed a herd. ''Almost 100 percent are crosses.'' He pointed up toward the hilltops, normally gently rounded and green, but now sandy in large patches from overgrazing. The two scientists are studying how high-producing cattle interact with the African ecosystem. If cows are like factories, you could say an Ankole is powered by a water wheel, while the Holstein requires a nuclear reactor.
 The principle of the ''tragedy of the commons,'' perhaps the most famous metaphor in ecology, is a cattle parable. It was first described by a 19th-century British economist and popularized by the biologist Garrett Hardin in a 1968 Science magazine essay about human overpopulation. Hardin was trying to refute the view that an unregulated free market invariably produces beneficial outcomes. ''Picture a pasture open to all,'' Hardin wrote. The benefit of adding a single calf went to each individual farmer, while the cost of adding that calf (the grass it would consume) would be distributed to all pasture users. ''Each man is locked into a system that compels him to increase his herd without limit -- in a world that is limited,'' he wrote. The commons, he predicted, would inevitably be picked clean.
 With the introduction of the Holsteins, something similar seems to be happening in Uganda. Farmers aren't literally increasing the sizes of their herds, but they are creating herds that consume unsustainable amounts of dwindling resources. And something else is being obliterated: genes. Each time a farmer crossbreeds his Ankoles, a little of the country's stockpile of adaptive traits disappears. It isn't easy to measure genetic ''dilution.'' What is evident, however, is that the Ankoles possess much worth saving. For instance, their horns, often seen as ornaments, actually disperse excess body heat. 
 Holsteins don't like heat. While a poorly adapted animal can survive for years in a harsh ecosystem, even a slight worsening of their conditions can have devastating effects. One rancher I met, John Kamiisi, told me that he'd lost his herd of Holsteins in a 1999 drought. He only avoided ruin because he kept some Ankoles, which could live on less water. Kamiisi told me he loved his sturdy Ankole bull ''like my own life'' but said he was starting to crossbreed again for financial reasons. Another elderly rancher said his whole Holstein herd died during Idi Amin's dictatorship, when chaos and inflation made it difficult to buy the imported medicines the cattle needed. He started again with a few Ankoles his neighbors gave him out of pity.
 ''For countries on the equator, I think in almost all cases the Holstein is very poorly suited -- maybe the least-suited breed,'' says Dr. Les Hansen, a professor at the University of Minnesota and a leading expert in cattle genetics. Often farmers are making decisions that are informed not by science, he said, but by sales pitches devised by multinational breeding concerns. ''As I travel the world,'' Hansen adds, ''my biggest challenge is countering all of the misleading marketing propaganda.''
 The world market in cattle breeding is controlled by a handful of companies, several of them based in the United States. The companies maintain facilities where they extract semen from bulls, keep genetic databases, publish rankings and cultivate a sort of bovine star system. Two legendary Holsteins, Chief, born in California in 1962, and Elevation, born in Virginia in 1965, fathered tens of thousands of offspring in their lifetimes -- and beyond, since their sperm was cryogenically frozen for future use. 
 Hansen's research suggests that every Holstein is descended from Chief and Elevation, and that 30 percent of all the Holstein genes in the world are traceable to those two bulls. That has created a serious problem with inbreeding, which has adverse effects on fertility and mortality. But overseas markets like Africa are, so to speak, virgin territory. According to industry figures, American companies exported 10 million ''doses'' of cattle semen in 2006. In Uganda, a company called World-Wide Sires, the international marketing arm of two American breeding cooperatives, is working with aid agencies to increase dairy production. 
 ''The proof is in the bucket,'' said George Nuwagira, a dairy farmer who is also the World-Wide Sires sales representative for western Uganda. I met him one morning in the market town of Kabwohe. A stout, garrulous fellow, he was wearing a yellow baseball cap with a smiling cartoon cow on it. He ushered me into his insemination center, a narrow tumbledown storefront that also sold sodas. At one end stood a wooden counter that was decorated with a flier advertising a bull named Earl, ''the Dairyman's Dream,'' which pictured Earl's daughters posed in such a way as to accentuate their enormous milk-swollen udders. Behind the counter sat a metal tank filled with liquid nitrogen. Nuwagira unscrewed its cap, and a thick cloud of white vapor billowed out. He retrieved a cluster of brightly colored plastic straws filled with premium semen.
 We were at the far end of the global semen supply chain. Nuwagira handed me an empty green straw. It was marked with the name ''Theseus'' and a long serial number, which indicated that the semen it had contained was collected at a facility near Plain City, Ohio, on Dec. 30, 2004. Three weeks before, he used Theseus' semen to impregnate one of his own Holsteins.
 Nuwagira took me to see the expectant mother. On the bumpy ride to his farmland in a breathtaking green valley, he told me that he was from the west's agriculturalist ethnic group, not the Bahima. He didn't care about the Ankole. ''To me as a modern farmer, the horns don't mean anything,'' Nuwagira said. He didn't name his cows like the Bahima but instead referred to them by numbers. He told me he owned just 35. ''You know, it was used as a status symbol in the past, to have so many head of cattle,'' he said. ''Those who had hundreds wouldn't sit with those who had less than 30. But these days, things have changed. When you talk of animals they don't ask you the numbers. They ask you the production.''
 Nuwagira's biggest problem was getting his product to market. ''You feed them, they will give you the volumes, but there are times when we find we are stuck having nowhere to sell it,'' he explained. Milk is perishable, and Uganda is a country where roads are bad and refrigeration is rare. The dairy trade in rural areas is largely controlled by bicycle vendors who sell raw milk from aluminum jugs. There used to be a more sophisticated network of government-affiliated dairy cooperatives, but most of these were dismantled in the 1990s, during a World Bank push for market liberalization. The private sector was supposed to fill the gap but never did. Anyway, some Ugandan tribes don't drink milk. They're lactose-intolerant.
 Crossbreeding follows the logic of the arms race. All the ranchers I met complained that Holsteins required expensive upkeep, and many didn't want to abandon tradition. But they've had to change because their neighbors are changing. The volume of milk produced in Uganda doubled between 1993 and 2003, but in the absence of a surge in demand or improved delivery systems, the product has literally flooded the market. As the price per liter has fallen, dairy farmers have had to rearm with Holsteins just to maintain their usual profit margins. International organizations realize that increased productivity means little if it's not accompanied by market growth. That's why the U.S. Agency for International Development is spending millions across Africa to promote dairy cooperatives and pay for advertisements inspired by America's famous ''Got Milk?'' campaign. But changing distribution and diets isn't as easy as changing breeds. ''A lot of consumers don't understand how important milk is,'' says Jim Yazman, a livestock specialist with the agency. 
 Economic forces can push a breed to extinction with frightening swiftness. In Vietnam, where pigs are the most important livestock species and the government has encouraged leaner foreign breeds, the percentage of indigenous sows has fallen to 28 percent from 72 percent since 1994, and 13 of the 15 local breeds are classified as either extinct or in danger. There were several million Red Maasai sheep in Kenya until the 1970s. Then, in just 15 years, indiscriminate crossbreeding with woollier imported sheep nearly drove them out of existence. But the wool sheep fared poorly in the Kenyan environment, in part because of intestinal parasites to which the Red Maasai were resistant. By the time that was discovered, though, purebred Red Maasai were almost impossible to find.
 Many tropical breeds may possess unique adaptive traits. The problem is, we don't know what is being lost. Earlier this year, the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization released its first-ever global assessment of biodiversity in livestock. While data on many breeds are scant, the report found that over the last six years, an average of one breed a month has gone extinct. ''The threat is imminent,'' says Danielle Nierenberg, senior researcher at the Worldwatch Institute, an environmental group. ''Just getting milk and meat into people's mouths is not the answer.''
 As the world's climate warms, and the environment becomes more inhospitable to the major breeds, humanity might need the genes that allow animals like the Ankoles to flourish in the African heat. The challenge is to safeguard the resource. There are two possible approaches: putting the animals in cold storage, or changing the economic equation. Proponents of the first option desire something like the Svalbard Global Seed Vault, a doomsday depository for plant species that an international consortium is building in the Arctic Circle. But storing sperm and embryos is far more expensive and technically difficult. Biodiversity advocates say that it would be preferable, anyway, for breeds like the Ankole to go on living in their pastures. The most obvious way to do that would be to create incentives to entice farmers to keep them. But even those who want to save endangered breeds recognize that subsidizing unproductive livestock in hungry countries is problematic. In November, at a conference sponsored by the International Livestock Research Institute in Nairobi, Kenya, Dr. Edward Rege, the organization's biotechnology director, gave a speech listing several ''inconvenient facts'' about conventional wisdom in the field, adding that conservation approaches can effectively amount to ''saying that farmers should remain poor.''
 The best hope for the Ankoles may reside at a modest, terraced complex on a breezy hillside in Uganda overlooking Lake Victoria in the old colonial town of Entebbe. It was constructed by the British in 1960, at the height of the Green Revolution, as an artificial-insemination center and a staging ground for introducing new breeds -- animals that mostly died off during the subsequent wars and dictatorships. Now called the National Animal Genetic Resources Center and Databank, the facility's new mission is to save indigenous animals like the Ankoles by giving them better care and selectively breeding them to compete in production. The center keeps a dozen bulls of different breeds, including two immense Ankoles that once belonged to President Museveni. Twice a week, technicians collect semen, which is used to inseminate cows at government farms or else packaged and sold directly to farmers. If it's successful, the program could offer a model to other developing nations. If, on the other hand, the Ankole cattle can't be saved even with such government support, it's difficult to imagine how any threatened breed will survive.
 ''They can produce milk and they put on meat,'' said Dr. Dan Semambo, the center's executive director. ''People don't know what they have.''
 Ugandans rave about the fresh milk out west, and every rancher I visited there served me a cup. It has a delicious sweet thickness. No matter how well nourished they are, though, the Ankoles probably can't produce as much milk as the Holsteins. Instead, the breed's salvation could lie in the slaughterhouse. President Museveni says he believes that Ankoles make exceptional beef cattle and wants to export their meat. Some studies suggest that Ankole beef is unusually lean and low in cholesterol. Mpairwe and his colleagues at Makerere University are completing a study in which Ankoles and crossbreeds were kept on nutrient-rich diets. In early December, the cattle were slaughtered and an ''expert panel'' of faculty and students conducted a taste test, with encouraging results. 
 Shortly before I left Uganda, I convened an expert panel of my own. We met one evening at Le Petit Bistro, a European-owned restaurant that serves Kampala's best steak. While we waited for our orders, I went back to the kitchen to meet the cook, Everest Neretse, who was wearing a white chef's jacket and flip-flops. He told me he came from the west. ''Ankole cattle, they are the best,'' he said. ''I can tell in the tenderness.'' I had my filet with a little garlic butter. When I cut into it, rich reddish juices spilled out, and the texture was so soft that I hardly needed to chew. It was almost as if you could taste the contentment of an unbounded life on the open range. The panel agreed: it was extraordinary, it was beautiful and in no time every trace of the Ankole was gone.

HEADLINE: In Arizona, Classics Hold Steady

BYLINE: By ROB SASS

 BODY:
THE state of the American economy was a cause for anxiety among auction houses and their clients leading up to this month's collector car sales in Arizona. As things turned out, there was little fallout from external conditions. Here are results of seven sales previewed in this section on Jan. 13 (''Forecast in Arizona: Cooling Prices at Some Elevations''). All prices include the buyer's premium, an additional commission to the auction house paid by the buyer. 
 1941 CHRYSLER THUNDERBOLT
 SOLD FOR: $1.32 million at RM Auctions.
 WHAT IT MEANS: Given the recent frenzy for automakers' show cars, it was a bit of a surprise that this early design study sold below estimate -- just $120,000 more than it brought two years ago. 
 1953 CHEVROLET CORVETTE
 SOLD FOR: $264,000 at RM Auctions.
 WHAT IT MEANS: The presale estimate was somewhat conservative in light of recent sales, yet the price was slightly under the low estimate. A restoration that was more than 20 years old and showing its age, and a string of recent sales of first-year 'Vettes, may have contributed to the mediocre result. 
 1970 CHEVROLET CHEVELLE LS6 COUPE
 SOLD FOR: $75,900 at Russo & Steele.
 WHAT IT MEANS: An anticipated result. Even documented LS6s like this one are down 25 percent from their 2006 high. Owners who paid in the $30,000 range five or six years ago can hold out for prices to recover, but those who bought at the market peak are likely to be under water for quite some time. 
 1971 Ferrari 365 GTB/4 Daytona
 SOLD FOR: $319,000 at Russo & Steele.
 WHAT IT MEANS: When the last string of public sales occurred, the Daytona coupe market was percolating at under $300,000. It now seems safe to say that the Daytona market is active again and that sub-$300,000 sales for good examples are a thing of the past. 
 1954 BUICK SKYLARK CONVERTIBLE
 SOLD FOR: $110,000 at Barrett-Jackson.
 WHAT IT MEANS: Condition is an important motivator for auction bidders, and this car's condition simply did not inspire people to lift their paddles. A better 1953 Skylark sold at Barrett-Jackson for $195,000. RM had a '54 that was nicer still, and it brought a market-correct $242,000. 
 1970 PLYMOUTH HEMI 'CUDA CONVERTIBLE RE-CREATION
 SOLD FOR: $91,000 at Barrett-Jackson.
 WHAT IT MEANS: Two years ago, a Hemi 'Cuda convertible replica sold for more than $200,000 at Barrett-Jackson; replicas like this are now worth less than half that. Today, collectors will pay top dollar only for authentic original cars with faultless paperwork, but $91,000 is probably less than it cost to build the car. 
 1936 DUESENBERG MODEL J SEDAN
 SOLD FOR: $1.1 million at Gooding & Company.
 WHAT IT MEANS: Although closer to the low end of the presale estimate, this is still a strong price for a closed Duesenberg. The two other Duesenbergs to choose from in Arizona held it back a bit, but Duesenbergs with documentation and original or period bodywork remain strong.

Was Huntington Right?
 To the Editor:
 In his essay about Samuel Huntington (''The Clash,'' Jan. 6), Fouad Ajami refers to a group of writers who in 1993 contributed to a special issue of Foreign Affairs concerning the Huntington thesis. I am one of those contributors -- and, unlike Ajami, I do not retract my criticism of Huntington's views about the alleged inevitability of a clash between Islam and the West. 
 As I wrote in Foreign Affairs at the time, divisions of policy within and between Muslim states prove that national sovereign interests trump religious extremism. Nor are all Muslim ruling establishments anti-West. Both Ajami and Huntington attribute unanimity to the ''Muslim world'' where it does not exist. 
 The Huntington thesis is anachronistic. It does not fit contemporary political realities in the Middle East. As current events there show, Muslim states are more divided among themselves today than ever before.
 ALBERT L. WEEKS
 Sarasota, Fla.
 To the Editor:
 ''It is not pretty at the frontiers between societies with dwindling populations ... and those with young people making claims on the world. Huntington saw this gathering storm,'' Ajami writes. How depressing, this bogus geopolitical approach to what is in fact a multitude of human tragedies. And what a pity the Book Review didn't temper Ajami's wrong-end-of-the-telescope observations with at least mention of recent novels about emigration from North Africa to Europe, where the human tragedies are explored in intimate detail. Laila Lalami's ''Hope and Other Dangerous Pursuits,'' Amara Lakhous's ''Clash of Civilizations Over an Elevator in Piazza Vittorio,'' Aziz Chouaki's ''Star of Algiers'' and Mahi Binebine's ''Welcome to Paradise'' come to mind among many.
 The emigrants these novelists describe are not coming to Europe under the banner of militant Islam or any banner at all; they just want to earn a living. And if they can't survive at home, demographics has less to do with it than politics. Take Algeria, where a huge trade surplus has been racked up lately from sales of oil at up to $100 a barrel, yet where millions of people still live on a dollar a day. Economic incompetence, murderous corruption and the total clampdown on civil society go a lot farther in explaining clandestine emigration from Algeria than demographics. 
 And the wretched status quo in countries like Algeria is maintained with the connivance and/or collusion of the United States, France and other trading partners, including lately Russia and China. Clash of civilizations? Alas, there is only one civilization at work here, the cult of money, and it's universal.
 Or let's accept that North Africa is rich in youth under the age of 20 and Western Europe rich in people past retirement age. Is this a threat or an opportunity? Why is the Roman Catholic Church in Italy, through its charity Caritas, a leading defender of the rights of Muslim immigrants? Is the West letting down its guard when the church defends the rights of Muslim immigrants to build mosques in Italian cities, or living up to its highest aspirations?

 Asia, Overlooked
 To the Editor: 
 I was delighted to see the issue devoted to Islam (Jan. 6), with essays in addition to book reviews. I was also dismayed that with the exception of an insightful contribution by William Dalrymple on the recent translation of ''The Adventures of Amir Hamza,'' there were no articles or analyses of Islam in Asia.
 Perusing the issue, one would have had no sense that a large majority of Muslims live in Asia today or that the four countries with the largest Muslim populations (Indonesia, Pakistan, India and Bangladesh) are all in Asia.
 It would have been very useful if the Book Review had taken this opportunity to dispel the prevailing American misperception that Islam is monolithic, militaristic and primarily Middle Eastern.

 The Word of the Lord
 To the Editor:
 Having just read ''Reading the Koran,'' by Tariq Ramadan (Jan. 6), I am awed by its spiritual power. The most amazing aspect of the essay is that you could replace the word ''Koran'' with the word ''Bible'' and have an astonishingly accurate, devoutly spiritual interpretation of the basis of Scripture in Christianity.

 Learning the Language
 To the Editor:
 Robert F. Worth's essay on trying to learn Arabic (''Arabic Lessons,'' Jan. 6) was a wonderful insight into the lure and mysteries of the language. As Worth toiled in the Middle East, I struggled in New York, taking courses at N.Y.U. and Westchester Community College. I engaged halal food vendors and Arab grocers, who invariably chose to reply in their broken English. As my family and I contemplated our first trip to our ancestral home, Syria, I thought we'd need a full-time guide. But maybe not. Robert Worth has had epiphanies of understanding. So have I. I'm canceling the guide. The essay gave me ''amal'' -- hope.

DOMESTIC DISTURBANCES I love coffee. And though I have previously shown myself willing to forgo all kinds of food and drink in the quest to rid myself of migraines, coffee is one habit that I am firmly committed never to break.
 It's not about the caffeine. I have largely renounced caffeine. I say largely because I know that the decaf I now drink all day isn't entirely caffeine-free. My attachment to coffee is about the taste, and the smell, and the gesture. ... the kind of gesture my mother's brother Mel used to make, waving toward the coffee pot, when you walked into his house in Brooklyn. ...
 I wouldn't be so pretentious as to say that I have measured out my life in coffee spoons. But it wouldn't be so far from the truth. I began drinking coffee at 9 -- teaspoons of warm, milky coffee from my father's cup in restaurants after dinner. By age 11, I was drinking it chummily with my mom over breakfast. I spent my adolescence over never-empty cups in places like Joe Jr.'s and Lepanto's and the Viand. There was time for this then, in my New York. 
 I miss that world terribly. 
 -- Judith Warner, ''Memory Refill''
 Reader Comments:
 This is beautifully written and a lovely little meditation on stepping outside the frantic worry of contemporary life. It brings me back, strangely, to that popular little Verlaine poem ''Le ciel est, par-dessus le toit...'' and the realization that the joy and peace of life is always there in the margins, in the background. -- Posted by James Hathaway
 Lovely column. And thank you for the shout-out to Joe Jr.'s -- my favorite coffee shop in New York, because it's in the same building as my first New York apartment. I stop in every time I'm in the city, and its stubborn refusal to change warms my heart. It also transports me back to a time when drinking coffee -- along with getting a job in the big city and having your own apartment -- meant you were one of the grown-ups. Thanks for the memories.

 OUTPOSTS For 50 days, Rudy Giuliani has had the Sunshine State nearly to himself. In advance of the presidential primary on Jan. 29, he's sucked up to the Cuban vote in Miami, pandered in Cape Canaveral about the space program, tried to scare retirees over early-bird specials in South Florida.
 There he is riding in a fire truck in a Miami parade, trailed by angry firefighters who blame him for multiple failures when New York was attacked. There he is in the Panhandle, the consummate Yankees fan trying to look down-home on the Redneck Riviera. And every night, his campaign phone bank reaches out to the diaspora of 1.5 million transplanted New Yorkers. Start spreading the news -- quick!
 Yet, the more they see of him in Florida, the more his poll numbers tank. Rudy's campaign is in a meltdown.

 THE WILD SIDE It has long been known that mutations that act on an embryo as it grows can have profound effects on the adult organism's appearance -- dogs with no fur, humans with the symmetry of the internal organs reversed so the heart is on the right instead of the left, blackbirds with all white feathers ... But it was generally assumed that such mutations don't play an important role in evolution -- that they're just a freak show. 
 Which is odd. A quick survey of nature shows a variety of traits likely to have evolved in one jump, rather than gradually. For instance, many species of vulture lack feathers on their head and neck. (This is thought to be an advantage, as it stops them getting their feathers dirty when they stick their heads into a rotting carcass.) Did the loss of feathers happen because in generation after generation individuals with the most receded feather line had more children? Or did it happen through a single jump?
 I haven't been able to find out -- I'm not sure the answer is known -- but I'm betting on the jump. The reason is that chickens with a bare head and neck often appear spontaneously: a single mutation blocks feather production from shoulder to beak. My guess is that if it can happen in chickens, it can happen in vultures -- and that in vultures, it gave an advantage.

 Reader Comments:
 Wonderful exercise in scientific writing for the general public of nonspecialists. Now if only some of these geneticists could direct their attention to the question of how a gene could acquire and transmit a behavior pattern -- such as how to build a web for a spider, or how to flap the wings for a bird. Is anyone looking at this? Or is it not possible to connect behavior with genetic evidence?
 -- Posted by Nelson Jonnes
 My advice is to quickly substantiate the real reason for these genetic shifts that produce profound changes in morphology before you hand the creationists a new ideological weapon. One thing for sure -- yes, that is possible, even in science -- the change at the genetic level is not random. 
 It is not induced by a supernatural force either. The cause of these changes is physics, but the mechanism is not yet known.

 CAMPAIGN STOPS History teaches us that even when primary opponents inflict hard shots, the ''victim'' of those attacks -- once he (or she) secures the nomination -- is little worse for the wear. Most infamously, George H.W. Bush assailed Ronald Reagan's economic plan as ''voodoo economics'' in 1980. Reagan went on to defeat Bush in the primaries, choose him for his running mate and win the general election in a landslide.
 During the 1992 primaries, Bill Clinton withstood a withering assault from Paul Tsongas, who called Clinton the ''pander bear'' -- and worse. Tsongas's harsh attacks did not prevent Clinton from winning that election. Equally strong barbs were thrown at Al Gore by primary opponent Bill Bradley, and by John McCain at George W. Bush in the 2000 primaries. But these primary campaign attacks didn't prevent Gore from winning the popular vote, nor Bush from winning the electoral college.
 For better or worse, the candidates would have to hurl much fiercer attacks than they did on Monday night before the Clinton-Obama-Edwards exchanges get anywhere near as hot as some other winning candidates have endured. 
 -- Ron Klain, ''Too Nasty?''
 THINK AGAIN What do independent voters do? Well, most of all, they talk about the virtue of being an independent voter. When they are asked to explain what that means, they say, ''I can't stand the partisan atmosphere that has infected our politics'' (forgetting that politics is partisan by definition); or ''We like to make up our own minds and don't want anyone telling us what to do'' (as if Democrats and Republicans were sheep eager to go over whatever cliff the leadership brings them to) or (and this was a favorite of those interviewed in Iowa and New Hampshire), ''We vote the person rather than the party.''
 Now, voting the person rather than the party is about the dumbest thing you can do ... The party affiliation of a candidate tells you what kind of appointments he or she is likely to make. ...
 Voting the person, however attractive or impressive he or she may be, could very well get you four years of policies you detest. 
 -- Stanley Fish,
 ''Against Independent Voters''
 Reader Comments:
 Being an independent means that we can argue issues in good faith instead of vilifying opponents as agents of evil. It means scoring poorly on rating scales of ideological purity. It means accepting as axiomatic the idea that no political party or ideology has a monopoly on truth or an immunity to hogwash.

 I agree with Mr. Fish when he says that ''parties matter.'' The trouble is, we've only got two of them. A proportional system of representation, rather than the winner-take-all model currently in place, would more accurately reflect the diversity of political opinion in this country. 
 Potential voters, ''independent'' or not, would be more likely to participate in a process which gives them more viable options. Who wants to go to the ice cream store when all they've got is chocolate or vanilla?

HEADLINE: Season of Discontent

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
THERE may be gloom and uncertainty in the housing market in this winter of economic discontent, but for the small number of brokers serving the truly rich in Manhattan, there is discontent for another reason: the dearth of trophy apartments in trophy buildings.
 While prices may be plummeting in Florida, California and Nevada, pity the poor broker who complained last week that she had a businessman from halfway around the world who had tens of millions of dollars to spend, and was looking for at least 5,000 square feet, but then had precious few apartments in Manhattan from which to choose. 
 Or as another broker, John Burger of Brown Harris Stevens, observed, in Manhattan real estate the law of supply and demand is sometimes turned upside down. ''The higher the price point, the more limited the choices,'' he said. ''When you have an unlimited budget, you have very few choices.'' 
 At the hottest New York buildings, some resales listed a few weeks ago are now in contract. At least four resales are in contract and waiting to close at the Time Warner Center in Columbus Circle, and the first two resales are now in contract at 15 Central Park West, which opened last year a few blocks away.
 Doug Russell and his son, Matthew, both brokers at Brown Harris Stevens, asked for sealed bids last month on a three-bedroom with river views at 15 Central Park West, with an asking price of $12.5 million, after they were besieged with offers. 
 The winning bidder visited the apartment five times, with parents and friends, but hesitated. ''They flew in and looked again and said they didn't want it,'' he said. The next highest bidders, also over the original asking price, then stepped up and signed a contract a few days ago, he said. 
 And now, brokers say, it appears that a record may have been set for the most money paid per square foot at another trophy building -- the Pierre Hotel on Fifth Avenue and 60th Street. A $25 million co-op apartment has just been sold to a European buyer, according to brokers. Meredyth Hull Smith, a broker at Sotheby's International Realty, who had the listing, confirmed that a sale had just closed but declined to provide details.
 The price for the nine-room, three-bedroom apartment with Central Park views works out to $7,000 to $8,000 a square foot, or even more, based on a floor plan with room measurements included with the listing, depending on whether interior columns and a separate maid's room are included. 
 That would place it above the $6,288 a square foot paid last August by Sanford I. Weill, the former chairman and chief executive of Citigroup, for a penthouse with terraces facing Central Park at 15 Central Park West. That was widely regarded as the highest price per square foot for a trophy apartment in Manhattan. 
 And last Wednesday, the most expensive co-op was sold -- a $46 million duplex at 1060 Fifth Avenue. It was bought by Scott A. Bommer, a hedge fund manager, who received permission from the board to combine two apartments. The unit was previously owned by Georgia Shreve, a writer. She was never successful in past attempts to combine the two apartments. Mr. Burger and colleagues at Brown Harris Stevens represented the seller. 
 At the Time Warner Center, buyers and sellers are planning a mass closing on Monday -- not for buyers looking to get into one of the most sought-after buildings in Manhattan, but to allow current owners to trade up to larger apartments. 
 The current owner of the 65th-floor apartment in the south tower, once owned by Ricky Martin, the pop star, is trading up to a 75th-floor apartment listed at $25 million in the same tower. An owner of a 66th-floor apartment in the north tower is trading up to the old Ricky Martin apartment. 
 When the deal for the old Ricky Martin apartment was made, the sale price was said to have been close to the asking price of $17.9 million, which was reduced from $18.9 million. The sellers, impatient to move, had actually agreed to a lower price of $15.85 million, according to a broker briefed on the transaction. 
 ''While the market is very hot and the building is very hot, we had an opportunity to negotiate almost 20 percent off for our client,'' said Adam Modlin of the Modlin Group. 
 The buyers of the old Ricky Martin apartment in turn listed their apartment in the north tower and agreed to sell it for just under $6 million, so they can apply the cash toward their purchase.

HEADLINE: Devalued Sonics Seek New Arena Or a New City To Call Home

BYLINE: By GREG BISHOP

DATELINE: SEATTLE 

 BODY:
The SuperSonics' losing streak reached 11 games last Monday with a loss to the Rockets in Houston, then mechanical problems forced the team plane to land temporarily in Oklahoma City.
 The Sonics spent two hours playing cards, watching tape and cracking jokes while they waited for another plane to come from California. If only briefly, everything hanging over this strange season -- the longest single-season losing streak in team history, the dispute with the city of Seattle, the threat of relocation -- faded into the background.
 ''That's what we needed,'' said Kevin Durant, the second pick in the last N.B.A. draft, who is the face of a franchise caught between cities.
 The first is Seattle, home since the 1967-68 season to a Sonics team that won the city's lone championship among the three major men's professional sports. The second is Oklahoma City, home to the team's chairman, Clay Bennett, and the ownership group that bought the Sonics and the Seattle Storm of the W.N.B.A. for $350 million in 2006. 
 Should Bennett win in court, the Sonics' next stop in Oklahoma City will be more permanent. They could move there as early as next season.
 ''The relocation issue is something we're all aware of,'' General Manager Sam Presti said. ''We're human beings. But they've done a remarkable job with staying focused.''
 Durant, 19, lives with his mother and two cousins on nearby Mercer Island. Designs on his signature Nike shoe are nearly complete. He plays video games with neighborhood youngsters who knock on the door.
 On Friday night, when the Sonics (9-34) lost their 13th consecutive game, 99-90 to Atlanta, Durant led the team with 17 points. The last time he lost this many games, he played offensive tackle and defensive end for a pee-wee football team that lost 36 in a row.
 The Sonics won 31 games last season, then traded their best players, guard Ray Allen to Boston and forward Rashard Lewis to Orlando. Their longest-tenured player is Luke Ridnour, a point guard in his fifth season.
 The task of rebuilding the Sonics falls to Presti, 31, a Rhodes scholar nominee who listens to Thelonious Monk and the hip-hop band the Roots, who reads historical books by David McCullough and plays the drums.
 Presti attended the N.B.A. equivalent of the Harvard Business School, working for the Spurs in San Antonio from 2000 until the Sonics hired him last June.
 P. J. Carlesimo, who joined the Spurs as an assistant coach in 2002, said he noticed the team seemed to promote Presti nearly every season. When front-office officials and coaches met for long and sometimes contentious discussions about personnel, Presti never backed down, never wavered. Beneath his boyish looks and charming demeanor was an executive committed to his convictions.
 ''He fools you,'' said Carlesimo, whom Presti hired as the Sonics' coach. ''He's totally different than how people who haven't worked with him perceive him.''
 The last book Presti read was ''The Energy Bus.'' His synopsis: a management book that shows readers how they can affect situations by how they frame them -- an appropriate theme this season.
 When Bennett bought the Sonics, he pledged a good-faith effort to keep them in Seattle. In November 2006, voters approved an initiative restricting tax subsidies for professional sports teams. Last April, the state Legislature rejected a proposal to build a $500 million arena in Renton. 
 Last August, Aubrey McClendon, a part owner, told an Oklahoma newspaper that the ownership group never intended to keep the Sonics in Seattle. The N.B.A. fined him $250,000 for the remark.
 In September, the City Council voted to enforce the Sonics' lease at Key Arena, which runs through 2010. The owners, who find their arena agreement unsuitable, filed for arbitration. The city filed to block arbitration.
 ''There isn't an answer right now to resolve this,'' said Tom Carr, the lawyer who represents the city in this case. ''My job is to keep them here for the lease, for 15 years. So there's two more left.''
 James Donaldson, who played 14 seasons with six N.B.A. teams, said people remembered him most vividly for his three seasons with the Sonics. He said the team's relationship with the community had dwindled in recent years, starting with a purchase of the team in 2001 led by Howard Schultz, the Starbucks chairman, and the losing seasons that followed.
 ''We have to keep hope alive,'' Donaldson said. ''To see Key Arena empty next season would leave a void, an empty feeling. A lot of people won't realize the impact of that until it hits them and they're gone.''
 The arena is also home to the Storm and the Seattle Thunderbirds of the Western Hockey League.
 Donaldson has hope that local businesspeople will buy the Sonics from Bennett. Forcing the Sonics to fulfill their lease would allow more time for potential buyers to come forward.
 In the interim, Brian Robinson and the Save Our Sonics group hold on to history. Last-minute infusions of public money helped finance new stadiums for the Seahawks and the Mariners.
 ''I try to look at the historical precedent,'' Robinson said. ''These things usually get done in the darkest day.''
 Sometimes Carlesimo drives past the neighboring palaces that house Seattle's other sports teams and shakes his head. He ranks the Mariners' Safeco Field and the Seahawks' Qwest Field among the best stadiums in the country.
 ''I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing for us to have one of the best basketball arenas in the country either,'' he said. ''The Sonics are a part of this town. Part of the fabric of Seattle.''
 In recent court documents, the Sonics said the opposite. They argued that if the team left, the local economy would not suffer. The Sonics promised to produce a survey that showed 66 percent of respondents said the team's leaving would make ''no difference in their lives.''
 Carr, the city's lawyer, called this ''a remarkable position for a sports team to take.'' Robinson, the Save Our Sonics leader, said, ''The N.B.A. should be embarrassed.''
 Nick Licata, a city councilman, has emerged as the most vocal opponent of publicly financing another stadium. He points to the N.B.A.'s economic model, one he said failed in New Orleans, Charlotte and Memphis. He said studies show Key Arena makes more money with a concert than a Sonics game, at a ratio of almost six to one.
 ''The sad part is that ultimately the fans are the ones who lose out in this whole deal,'' Licata said. ''I don't see an immediate happy ending to this. It's a national problem. It's just going to replay itself in city after city. People here are adamant about not subsidizing another stadium.''
 Carr expects a trial date to be set on Tuesday. The team wants it to start March 24, so the case can be resolved in time for it to move. The city asked for an Oct. 27 start date, requesting more time to prepare for trial.
 Commissioner David Stern told reporters in November that Seattle would not get another N.B.A. franchise should the Sonics leave.
 The Sonics' championship banners hung from the practice facility Thursday, the last a Northwest Division title in 2004-5.
 Carlesimo raved about Durant's ability to focus, to fight double teams and to ignore the lawsuit and the possibility of relocation. He makes jump shot after jump shot, seemingly oblivious to the turmoil swirling around him.
 ''Wherever we end up, we've got to play basketball either way,'' Durant said. ''Seattle's a great place to be. I'd love to stay here. I've got faith they're going to make the right decision.''

HEADLINE: What Do 'Cram-Downs' Cost?

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
PENDING bankruptcy legislation is something few homeowners pay attention to, but when the industry's leading trade group suggests that the prospective law could cost new borrowers $200 a month or more, it is hard to ignore.
 The legislation in question is the Emergency Home Ownership Mortgage Equity Protection Act of 2007, which the House of Representatives' Judiciary Committee passed last month. Under the proposal, bankruptcy judges would be permitted to change the terms of a mortgage and allow borrowers to repay only part of the loan.
 The legality of this practice, known as a cram-down in industry parlance, has been in question for years, and cram-downs have been used sparingly. 
 But mortgage bankers contend that if Congress condones cram-downs, lenders will have less faith in the underlying value of the mortgage, and they will have to charge interest rates about 1.5 percentage points higher on all mortgages to offset the risk of future cram-downs.
 The Mortgage Bankers Association, based in Washington, said borrowers buying a middle-class home in New York State would pay about $250 more per month if the legislation passed. ''If this proposal becomes law, it will amount to a new tax on New York homeowners,'' David Kittle, the mortgage bankers' chairman-elect, said in a prepared statement.
 Using 2006 data from New York as an example, the mortgage bankers' group said that an increase of 1.5 percentage points in the interest rate on the average loan amount, $250,000, would cost New York borrowers about $2,990 annually. New Jersey borrowers with an average mortgage would pay $2,875 more annually, and Connecticut borrowers would pay $2,636 more.
 In explaining the predicted effects of cram-downs to Congress, Mr. Kittle made a multifaceted argument.
 Among other things, he said that current bankruptcy laws allow cram-downs for mortgages on vacation homes, investment properties and other houses that are not the borrower's principal residence. The interest rates charged for those properties, he said, are typically three-eighths of a percentage point higher than rates on mortgages that cannot be modified by bankruptcy judges.
 Not everyone accepts the Mortgage Bankers Association's math, however. ''The M.B.A.'s number is kind of hokum,'' said Adam J. Levitin, who teaches bankruptcy law at Georgetown University. After recently analyzing loan data from 1978 to 1993, he found that interest rates did not rise in areas where cram-downs were common.
 ''I'm trying to figure out why the mortgage industry is so opposed to this reform,'' Mr. Levitin said, ''because it won't result in huge losses for them.'' 
 When briefed on Mr. Levitin's arguments, John Mechem, a spokesman for the Mortgage Bankers Association, said in an e-mail response, ''In the end, consumers will bear the brunt of this legislation in the form of higher costs and/or tighter credit.'' 
 Craig Focardi, an analyst with the TowerGroup, a financial-services consultancy in Needham, Mass., agreed that lenders would incur greater losses on loans if cram-downs were permitted.
 ''But I doubt the M.B.A.'s number,'' he said. ''It's not the way lenders price loans. They don't say, 'Hey, let's add the cram-down pricing add-on of 1.5 percent!' If I were to guess at additional financing cost for new borrowers resulting from cram-downs on defaulted loans from existing borrowers, it might be $5 to $10 per month.''

EZRA POUND: POET
 A Portrait of the Man and His Work. 
 Volume I: The Young Genius, 1885-1920. 
 By A. David Moody. 
 Illustrated. 507 pp. Oxford University Press. $47.95. 
 T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound were the ''Odd Couple'' of 20th-century poetry, a most unlikely pair who between them rewrote the rules for everyone else. Eliot was Felix, of course: fussy, clerkish, conservative in both politics and religion, so somber that as a young man he sometimes dabbed his face with powder to make himself look even grayer. And Pound was Oscar: a yapper, provocateur and shameless self-promoter with a radical opinion on just about anything; he signed his name with a caricature of a gadfly and strode about London in the years before World War I wearing an earring, a sombrero and trousers made of green billiard cloth. From our perspective, almost a hundred years later, it's hard to imagine that these two ever sat in the same room, let alone shared meals, friends, manuscripts. Eliot is now an almost churchly figure in our cultural imagination, the prelate of modernism, while Pound, if we bother to think of him at all, is remembered mostly as an embarrassment -- a crank, a Fascist and anti-Semite confined to an asylum. 
 But one of the virtues of A. David Moody's new biography of Pound is to remind us that when the two poets first met, in 1914, Pound was by far the greater presence, and that without him Eliot might never have become the Eliot we revere. Pound, three years older, spotted Eliot's gift immediately (he called ''The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock'' the ''best poem I have yet had or seen from an American''), urged him on and helped him get published. When Eliot, then a graduate student in philosophy at Oxford, decided to give up an academic career for a life in poetry, it was Pound who wrote and broke the news to Eliot's parents. Pound was similarly helpful to Joyce, for whom he scrounged money and even scavenged an old pair of shoes; to Wyndham Lewis; to the sculptor Henri Gaudier-Breszka, whose agent he became -- to just about everyone who mattered artistically in pre-war London. 
 One way or another, he was connected to all the important little magazines of the time. He had an unerring eye for talent and was tireless in his efforts to promote the work of those he admired. He was a whirlwind of energy in those days -- a ''highly mechanized typing volcano,'' he called himself -- and so restless that, unable to sit still, he broke the legs off chairs. In the dedication of ''The Waste Land'' Eliot called him il miglior fabbro -- the finer craftsman -- because of his brilliance as an editor. (Were it not for Pound, we might still know that poem as ''He Do the Police in Different Voices.'') He even took his red pencil to Yeats, and Moody's book includes two pages showing his brilliant, slashing revision of ''The Two Kings.'' Pound was so good an editor, in fact, and so enterprising a talent-spotter and impresario -- such a cultural force -- that he would easily merit a biography even if he had never written a poem of his own.
 And it would be an easier biography to write. Unlike Eliot, whose output was relatively small for a poet of such stature, Pound wrote reams, not all of it good. The jury is still out, in fact, on the true significance of his work. Some critics consider him the major poet of his era; others dismiss his ''Cantos'' as gibberish. What makes Pound's poetry even more confounding is that it was so frequently at odds with his many pronouncements and manifestos. ''Make it new'' was his slogan, and yet his early work wasn't new at all. It was warmed-over Pre-Raphaelism. Pound's flirtation with Imagism produced a great many maxims (''Use no superfluous word, no adjective which does not reveal something''; ''Do not retell in mediocre verse what has already been done in good prose'') and probably his best-known short poem, ''In a Station of the Metro'': 
 The apparition of these faces in the crowd; Petals on a wet, black bough.
 Pound's connection with Imagism was short-lived, however (he quit the movement when Amy Lowell and others wouldn't let him run it), and he never fully embraced it. At the same time he was writing ''In a Station'' he was also writing a lot of verse that was old-fashioned and formulaic. In principle, he declared that poetry ought to be concrete and immediate; in practice, and in the ''Cantos'' especially, he often wrote poems so allusive and erudite that to understand them you had to be as well-read as Pound was. 
 In sorting out all Pound's contradictions and complexity, Moody, a professor emeritus at the University of York and the author of a previous book about Eliot, is invaluable. He knows more about Pound's poetry than probably anyone else alive, and supplies careful, detailed readings of all the early books (this volume ends in 1920; a second will cover the years until Pound's death in 1972). He even manages to uncover a plot of sorts in Pound's fitful development, culminating in the ''Fourth Canto'' of 1919 and ''Hugh Selwyn Mauberley,'' a perplexing poem that both is and isn't autobiographical. Vastly simplified, the story is that Pound, who was immensely learned in Renaissance and Provencal poetry, was for a while -- before he had much to say -- interested in the sound of poetry almost at the expense of its sense, and that he had to discover both a suitable subject and suitable method for himself, a way of engaging the world and not just the poetic past.
 Helpful as it is, though, Moody's book is sometimes more Felix than Oscar: it's dense, meticulous (except for the author's dismaying habit of forming the plural of a proper name by adding an apostrophe before the 's.'), formidably well researched and, in the first half especially, a little dull. Moody is more concerned with cramming in information than with fashioning a narrative, and his chapters are organized like an outline, with little subheads. He has little gift for characterization, so that the key people in Pound's life, figures like Hilda Doolittle (or H. D., as she became), Ford Madox Ford or Harriet Weaver, the publisher of The Egoist, flit through these pages like disembodied presences, sometimes introduced in footnotes or sometimes not at all. Even Pound himself is a little remote sometimes. Moody has not much interest in psychologizing, or in trying to explain why Pound was the way he was, and says next to nothing, for example, about his love life or lack of one.
 Oddly, Pound's bohemianism did not extend to sex. His courtship of the woman who became his wife, Dorothy Shakespear, was touchingly old-fashioned, with Pound's letters and visits strictly rationed by Dorothy's mother (herself a former mistress of Yeats's) because his financial prospects were so poor. Dorothy, one senses from her letters, might gladly have eloped, but Pound was in no hurry. When they did finally marry, in 1914, their relationship was companionable but hardly passionate. Friends of Pound's with a more prurient bent than Moody even wondered whether they slept in the same bed. There are things more important than sex, Pound had written in 1912, and perhaps he meant it, or perhaps his erotic life took place in his brain, an organ he once called a ''great clot of genital fluid.'' A curious thing about his poetry is that there are almost no genuine love poems to speak of, or none addressed to real women. His love-objects tended to be abstract figures, diaphanous goddesses and the like.
 Like a lot of self-invented people, Pound was in the beginning part genius and part humbug -- something that William Carlos Williams, a few years ahead of him at the University of Pennsylvania, noticed right away. Pound ''was often brilliant,'' he wrote, ''but an ass.'' Pound was also, in classic American fashion, a young man from the provinces determined to make his mark in the metropolis. He was born in Hailey, Idaho, in 1885 but grew up in the Philadelphia suburbs after his father took a job with the Philadelphia Mint. By 15 he had determined to be a poet -- an ambition he certainly didn't inherit from his parents, though they loyally supported him -- and then bounced from school to school pursuing a curriculum of his own devise. He enrolled at Penn, finished at Hamilton College, where the professors were less fussy about requirements, and then went back to Penn for a graduate degree he never finished. 
 In 1907 he took a job teaching at Wabash College, in Indiana, but found the atmosphere so stifling that he contrived to get himself kicked out by harboring a chorus girl in his room. With a small parental allowance he sailed for Venice, where he arranged for an Italian printer to run up a few copies of his first book, ''A Lume Spento,'' and then headed for London, intent on making a name for himself. He succeeded in remarkably short order, and even won over the great man himself, Yeats, whose secretary he eventually became, and even the best man at his wedding. 
 Reading between the lines in Moody's book, you get the sense that Pound in these years was charming and insufferable in about equal measure and bestowed his friendship only on those who met his very exacting standards. To those who didn't he could be withering. He challenged the poet Lascelles Abercrombie to a duel on grounds of ''stupidity'' so great it amounted to ''public menace,'' and he called The Times of London a ''slut-bellied obstructionist,'' a ''fungus'' and a ''continuous gangrene.''
 Every now and then is a hint of the even darker, nuttier Pound to come: casual anti-Semitism, a burst of misogyny, contempt for the stupidity of the masses, a growing fascination with the dubious economics of one Maj. C. H. Douglas. And throughout the whole, even as he is heading toward the great artistic breakthrough of the ''Cantos,'' there is a sense of swelling intemperateness and self-importance. By the end of 1920, when he declared himself disgusted with England and prepared to move to France, he had pretty much worn out his welcome, and everyone, even Eliot, was glad to see him go.

HEADLINE: In Desert, the Prices Keep Their Heat

BYLINE: By JERRY GARRETT

DATELINE: SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. 

 BODY:
 THE clatter and the chatter of a Champagne brunch gave way to sudden silence as the elegant yellow Ferrari crept onto the stage. 
 Only a very special car would have such an effect on the crowd, here for the Gooding & Company classic car auction on Jan. 19. This Ferrari, a 1959 250 GT -- one of only about 50 long-wheelbase California Spiders ever made -- certainly qualified. Its V-12 engine purred. Its wire-spoke wheels sparkled. 
 The bidding opened at $2 million and continued among several aspiring owners at $100,000 increments.
 How high would it go? Good question. Previously, such a Ferrari might have been valued at $3.5 million, but here the bidding slowed as it passed $2.7 million, down to increases of just $50,000 at a time. The audience seemed to be holding its breath. 
 These are uncertain times in the world of automobile collecting, values rising and falling with the health of the economy. In the past, when the economy came down with a cold, the classic-car market lapsed into something close to pneumonia. Now, as the economy shakes with the onset of chills and fever, potential buyers seem to be loading up on healthy doses of caution. 
 The Ferrari and its driver waited motionless on stage. The auctioneer, Charlie Ross, is a proper Englishman with an accent to match. Conducting the sale with the same decorum that prevails at his fine art auctions, Mr. Ross politely but firmly tried to coax higher amounts from the two bidders still competing for the Italian beauty.
 Down to $25,000 increments now, the bidding paused at $2.975 million.
 ''Do I hear $3 million?'' the auctioneer implored, looking plaintively at a hesitant bidder. ''Three? No?''
 The vast auction space, decorated like a hotel ballroom, was silent, save for the tinkling of crystal chandeliers.
 ''Two million, nine hundred and seventy-five thousand,'' Mr. Ross enunciated slowly.
 ''Once!'' he snapped. ''Twice!''
 He paused again.
 ''Now $3 million!'' he shouted exultantly, as the lagging bidder answered with a nearly imperceptible gesture. ''Now $3 million. Do I hear more, sir?'' He turned to the other man.
 Alas, it was over. The bidder signaled ''No.'' The gavel came down. And the Ferrari idled off the stage.
 The audience was momentarily stunned, but then the applause started, growing to a roar as the realization sunk in: the yellow Ferrari was the star of not only this show, but of every auction held nearby.
 There were, in fact, at least six major auctions in central Arizona over the course of two full weeks this month. Nearly 2,000 collector cars and items of automobilia changed hands, worth a total of $160 million, according to results supplied by the auction houses. But the yellow Ferrari, which ended up at $3.3 million with commissions, easily topped them all. Sixteen other cars brought prices of more than $1 million. 
 Arizona in winter is where the rich and weather-weary come to play and pay, a draw for conventions, golf and tennis tournaments and, of course, the auction season for collector cars.
 The mammoth Barrett-Jackson sale, with its 600,000 square-foot big top tent and a river of hopeful sellers, is the blazing sun in this universe, its gravitational pull attracting the other auctions to town. It is well worth visiting some of those planets, like the boutique Gooding auction, which came to the Scottsdale gathering for the first time this year. Although its location, in a Dillard's department store parking lot, might have lacked a certain cachet, the 72 cars it offered were all first-rate -- including a Lincoln Continental customized for Raymond Loewy that sold for $451,000 -- bringing in $21 million in total sales. 
 RM Auctions, which also caters to a high-end clientele, rang up $27 million in sales in its seventh year at the luxurious Arizona Biltmore. RM's totals included six of the top nine transactions over all -- two of which, a 1934 Packard Twelve coupe and a 1936 Mercedes-Benz 540K, exceeded $2 million each. These were reserve price auctions and all but 5 of the 88 vehicles offered were sold.
 The sales percentage wasn't that high at Russo & Steele's 200,000-square-foot auction tent on vacant state land in northeast Scottsdale. Of 509 cars offered, 311 sold, said Drew Alcazar, the company's president, for a total of $19.4 million. That compared favorably with last year's total of $20 million. ''Our top transaction this year was $412,500 for a 1969 L88 Corvette,'' he said.
 Barrett-Jackson reported $88 million in sales, including sales of automobilia like porcelain signs, gas pumps, pedal cars and souvenirs. A year ago, the Barrett-Jackson event -- it includes concerts, a nonautomotive shopping mall and other attractions -- grossed $111 million, according to Luke DeRouen, a spokesman. Barrett-Jackson offered 1,163 collector vehicles in no-reserve sales, compared with 1,271 last year.
 Over all, Tom duPont, publisher of The duPontRegistry, called the totals impressive.
 ''While many had predicted a classic low-revenue, low-sales meltdown, it was quite the opposite,'' he wrote in an e-mail message. ''When sellers were faced with reserve prices that were ahead of the market, many promptly dropped the reserve and generally got a good price. This would be a return to normalcy in the market, rather than the speculative frenzy of the last few years.''
 Mr. Alcazar of Russo & Steele said prices had hit a plateau at his auctions, rather than dropping. Selectivity, he noted, is now crucial. ''Buyers aren't hunting with a shotgun anymore,'' he said. ''Now, they're snipers.''
 Mr. Gooding conceded that although a number of his offerings sold ''at the low end of expectations,'' he was encouraged that ''the special cars all exceeded our expectations.''
 Most sellers hoped for the best, but prepared for the worst. They seemed to come away, for the most part, relieved and even pleasantly surprised.
 At Barrett-Jackson, with its 39 hours of nationally televised auctioneering on the Speed cable network, the scene played out more agreeably than last year, when buyers, sellers and even the press tussled with company officials over auction prices; a defamation lawsuit filed by the company against a 2007 customer was settled just before this year's event.
 The top seller in Barrett-Jackson's weeklong event at the Westworld fairgrounds was the 1963 Chevrolet Corvette Rondine concept car, built by Pininfarina for that year's Paris auto show, that brought $1.6 million. 
 Also auctioned were such oddities as the 40-foot-tall Robosaurus robotic dinosaur (for $575,000), a pop-culture icon, and a '69 Chevy Camaro tribute car modeled after one owned by Dale Earnhardt -- and was advertised as having an engine block from the Intimidator's 2000 Daytona 500 racecar.
 Charity auctions raised $2 million from sales of a 2009 Corvette ZR1, the very first 2008 Dodge Challenger and a one-of-kind 2008 Ford Shelby GT500KR.

HEADLINE: Faith in Granola Earned Its Makers Millions

BYLINE: By JAN ELLEN SPIEGEL

DATELINE: NORWALK 

 BODY:
 One morning almost five years ago, Stew Leonard Jr. found Kelly Flatley and Brendan Synnott sitting in the lobby of his mega-store in Norwalk holding a tray with their Bear Naked granola cereal, milk and a banana. After tasting it, he ordered 20 cases on the spot.
 It was a big break for Ms. Flatley and Mr. Synnott, 20-somethings from Darien, who had to spend the night baking enough granola to fill the order. 
 So when Mr. Leonard heard that Ms. Flatley and Mr. Synnott had sold Bear Naked to the Kashi subsidiary of the Kellogg Company in a $122-million deal late last year that included Kellogg's purchase of Gardenburger, he was thrilled.
 ''Everybody was cheering for Kelly and Brendan,'' he said about the friends who grew up together and who he said showed passion and willingness to work hard. ''Everybody's happy for them and what they've done.''
 In a short time, they took their business of hand-baking granola overnight at the Rowayton Market to producing more than 40,000 pounds a day, and $65 million in sales in 2007. 
 Its stunning growth and success has been celebrated in Fairfield County, especially in Darien, where it began; Norwalk, where the company is headquartered; and Stamford, where the kitchen is. There's the big sign on the side of their headquarters next to the Yankee Doodle Bridge in Norwalk, the playful slogan ''Do you get bear naked?'' and the metro-chic plastic bags with the sleek bear-claw logo.
 Even though nearly 90 jobs will be lost from the sale of the company and the relocation of its production facility, Ms. Flatley and Mr. Synnott seemed to have generated enough good will that the community is still cheering them. 
 ''We became really familiar faces with people, and I think that was powerful,'' said Ms. Flatley, 28. She and Mr. Synnott began placing Ms. Flatley's granola in local markets during the summer of 2002. They spent enormous time in each of those markets as well as at community and sporting events -- handing out samples and talking to customers, asking what they could do better, and learning the retail ropes from store managers.
 ''People weren't used to products coming alive,'' Ms. Flatley said. ''We wanted to make ourselves accessible because we wanted to let people know that there was really a face behind the product.''
 Mr. Synnott, 29, a hyperkinetic former high school quarterback, said he knew it was impossible to tackle the big cereal companies on their playing field, so taking the local retail and marketing route was essential. ''We had no other way of introducing our product to people,'' he said. ''I could never win just advertising against Kellogg's.
 ''For us it was about those one-on-one interactions.''
 And people responded.
 ''You'd see people in the stores and they'd be like, 'Brendan, I opened up this package and your tear notch came a little bit undone, and then I bought another package to check it out and that one did it too. Thought you'd want to know,''' Mr. Synnott recalled. ''And we were always willing to listen.''
 That willingness, by many accounts, was critical in the company's success, and another way it endeared itself to the community. Mr. Synnott and Ms. Flatley took advantage of the area's business elite to learn how to expand a company, turning to friends like James Ozanne of Darien, a longtime financial services executive whose son had played grade school baseball with Mr. Synnott.
 ''They're gracious, and they welcome advice, and they care about people,'' said Mr. Ozanne, who spent many hours schooling Mr. Synnott in the details of capital, cash flow and business planning. ''You feel very proud of them because in some way you touched their lives.''
 But for some lives that were touched, the future is suddenly uncertain. Kellogg's plans to close the production plant by the end of this year. Its 48 employees will receive severance packages. Of the 40 employees in the Norwalk office, Mr. Synnott and Ms. Flatley are under contract to Kellogg's until Feb.1. The remaining employees will be given opportunities to apply for positions at Kellogg's, but with no guarantees. They do have valuable stock options that Mr. Synnott and Ms. Flatley put in place to cushion the blow of a sale. Their plan was always to build the company and then sell it. 
 ''That's the price of success,'' said Michael Freithmuth, Stamford's director of economic development, who noted that Mr. Synnott and Ms. Flatley were frequent contributors to community functions.
 ''We can absorb the people and get a new business in the building,'' he said ''But the thing that's hard to measure and hard to quantify for the general public is how do you replace that community contribution?''
 Chris Mears, 27, who grew up in Darien with Mr. Synnott and Ms. Flatley and was their first employee, said he did not view the sale in terms of a job lost.
 ''I helped build and grow a company and had amazing business experience,'' said Mr. Mears, now based in Denver as the central region sales director. ''It's something I couldn't have bought for $100,000 getting an M.B.A. I couldn't be more thankful.''
 Mr. Synott said, ''It's always fun to be a part of something that is a great ride.''

HEADLINE: For Strikers, The Agony Of Spare Time

BYLINE: By MELENA RYZIK

 BODY:
''OF course I have time to talk to you,'' Kevin Bleyer, a writer for ''The Daily Show With Jon Stewart,'' said at the beginning of a recent interview. ''Let me just put down this copy of 'War and Peace' that I now have time to read.''
 Like his fellow members of the Writers Guild of America East, Mr. Bleyer, 36, has been on strike for nearly three months. He was joking about ''War and Peace,'' though not about having enough hours to embark on a project of that magnitude. As the fight has dragged on between the guilds -- East and West -- and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers over compensation for the use of material on the Internet, cellphones and other new media, he and his compatriots have had to find ways to fill their days, and their wallets. At press time, writers and producers had just started informal talks, the first meetings since early December. 
 ''Writers don't tend to be very good at time management or organization -- if they were, they'd be producers, and therefore evil,'' another ''Daily Show'' writer, Sam Means, wrote via e-mail. ''So I think a lot of people are pretty frustrated right now, and some are downright bored.''
 Mr. Means, 26, who has been using his spare time to pitch cartoons to The New Yorker, has been fortified, financially and creatively, by the fact that a satirical book he wrote, ''The Practical Guide to Racism,'' was published this month (under the pseudonym C. H. Dalton); his advance has helped offset his unemployment, he said.
 For his part Mr. Bleyer has covered the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina for National Public Radio and an online humor site, 23/6, an offshoot of The Huffington Post. Like most striking writers who have turned to freelancing to keep busy, he did it mostly for professional growth, and still frets about finances.
 A few writers have returned to gigs they had hoped to forget: waiting tables, bartending, copywriting, tutoring. Some who began as performers have returned to the grind of auditioning for commercials. Many -- especially on the West Coast, whose guild recommends 12 hours a week on the picket line (less is asked of the East Coast contingent, especially in the cold) -- have discovered that striking is nearly a full-time job in itself. And as the picketing has continued, whatever excitement there was at its outset -- The solidarity across genres! The networking opportunities! The Web videos! -- began to fade.
 ''There's definitely a winter malaise setting in,'' said Bryan Tucker, a writer for ''Saturday Night Live.'' ''The fun group dynamic that we had the first week or two has dissolved. It's tough to see any kind of hope on the horizon.''
 Mr. Tucker, 34, was speaking from the Upper East Side home he shares with his wife and two young daughters. A veteran comedy writer whose credits include ''The Chris Rock Show'' and ''Mad TV,'' he has been struggling to keep afloat, and has returned to his roots as a stand-up comic to keep busy and funny. Performing in comedy clubs, he said, he has been paid ''between nothing and $100,'' averaging about $20 to $40 per gig. He has also written humor articles for newspapers and magazines. But, he said, ''if I added all the money up for all those, it probably would not make a week's pay for what I make writing in television.'' Though his wife, Rachael, has a secure job in finance, they are cutting back; even joining a gym to make the most of the time off was deemed too costly. At one union benefit performance Mr. Tucker joked about having to be a temp worker, a solution he later said he would seriously consider: ''I'm certainly not too proud to go back to doing that.''
 Aaron Solomon, 32, who lives in Burbank, Calif., has weighed the same option. Mr. Solomon, who has written questions and host patter for ''The Weakest Link,'' ''One Versus 100'' and ''The New Pyramid,'' has actually been on strike since August, when he and three other union members walked off ''Temptation,'' a syndicated pop culture game show. The show's production company, FremantleMedia, would not negotiate a guild contract. (About half of all game shows are covered by the guild, a union spokeswoman said; most reality programming is not.) 
 Mr. Solomon went on unemployment, earning the maximum compensation, $450 a week -- about a quarter of what he made in TV -- but that is about to run out. His prolonged joblessness, and unexpected car repairs, have nearly wiped out his savings, he said. Still, he serves as a volunteer strike captain, spending up to 20 hours a week picketing, attending meetings and sending e-mail updates. He has also turned down seven invitations to be interviewed for reality-show jobs, he said.
 ''I don't believe in contributing to the genre that we're trying to get covered,'' he said. ''They work as hard but don't get any health care or the same salary, or even the respect of being given the title of writers. I think it's absolutely the right thing to do.''
 So he has cut back on expenses and started eating at two Los Angeles-area restaurants, the Bob's Big Boy in Taluca Lake and Swingers, where an anonymous celebrity benefactor has offered to pick up the tab for any card-carrying writer. He has also looked into temp work as a closed-caption writer. 
 Career shifts may be more common in the coming weeks, as residual checks dwindle. Depending on many factors -- including the length of the show and whether it is on cable or a network -- payments can be lucrative for first-time reruns, but they decrease exponentially with each broadcast. Still, for people like Nina Bargiel, who wrote 17 episodes of the Disney hit ''Lizzie McGuire'' a few years ago but isn't currently working in television, that money is much appreciated. ''If they're doing a marathon, and they play six of your shows, that's $300,'' she said. ''I'm lucky if I make that in a week.''
 The unions have tried to stress that, while some of their 12,000-plus members nationwide are Hollywood-level talents, with multi-million-dollar incomes to match, many more are middle class. According to union statistics, nearly half of the West Coast members are unemployed at any time. (There are no such statistics for East Coast members, but the union spokeswoman said the figure was similar.)
 Among the unlucky in Los Angeles are Ms. Bargiel, 35, whose last guild writing job, for the Nickelodeon show ''Romeo!,'' was in 2003. She has also been employed by nonguild shows like ''The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy'' on the Cartoon Network, but by 2006 those jobs had dried up. She wound up working part-time behind the desk in a gym where she was once a member, and software testing for an Internet start-up while hustling for more television work. She also pickets four or five days a week, which sometimes means working from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m. 
 Because any settlement is not likely to be retroactive, ''I personally may not gain anything,'' she said. ''But ideally the person who comes behind me will not be scrambling to get from the gym to the software beta-testing job to the picket line.''
 One benefit of the strike, said Michele Mulroney, a screenwriter, ''is, you've inadvertently radicalized a bunch of otherwise mellow people. Like, maybe we will make our own Internet content.''
 Ms. Mulroney, 41, quickly added that she and her husband and writing partner, Kieran Mulroney, were among the privileged few who could ride out the strike: they have polished scripts for films like ''Mr. and Mrs. Smith,'' and were juggling three projects when the walkout began. 
 But newcomers like Andres du Bouchet, 36, who joined the union in August, when he received his first television writing job, on ''Talkshow With Spike Feresten,'' a new late-night program on Fox, may not be so fortunate; he has not even finished paying his initiation dues yet, and the lag might cost him career momentum. Also, he's not much of a self-starter at home. ''I get easily distracted,'' he said. 
 Having writers like these march side by side on the picket lines has thrown some of the industry's class differences into sharp relief. (Ms. Bargiel admitted feeling ''a little embarrassed'' about her recent career turn, though she added that everyone picketing, from a Farrelly brother on down, has been welcoming; she also emphasized that she considered having day jobs par for the course for a writer.) 
 And there is a sense that complaining about the fine print on a job that many would jump at is whiny or elitist. So despite the malaise that comes from being in a professional limbo -- and the increased opportunity for procrastination that a life without deadlines affords -- some writers have seen a silver lining.
 Mr. Tucker, from ''Saturday Night Live,'' is actually able to spend more time with his family. ''It's nice to have the kind of life that most people have, where everyone is home and we have dinner together,'' he said. Mr. Solomon, the game show writer, just formed a new band, Super Duper, which includes a percussionist and reality-show writer (employed), and a horn player and sound editor (unemployed). ''On the upside we have more time to rehearse,'' said Mr. Solomon, who plays bass and does some songwriting. 
 Ms. Mulroney has gone back to writing a play and said many friends had picked up ''passion projects,'' like unfinished novels, children's books and developing screenplays. After the strike ''the town will be flooded with new material,'' she said.
 As Mr. Bleyer of ''The Daily Show'' put it: ''I believe it was Lisa Simpson, on 'The Simpsons,' who said, 'This is a crisatunity.' It's a small crisis and I'm looking for an opportunity.'' He thought a minute and added: ''Are you offering? You need a ghostwriter? I could be a ghostwriter for a journalist. I could punch it up.''

HEADLINE: A Baptist Coalition Aims for Moderation

BYLINE: By NEELA BANERJEE

 BODY:
For more than 150 years, Baptists in the United States have splintered along political, theological and racial lines. But this week, some of the country's largest Baptist groups -- representing about 20 million believers -- will meet to try to mend the old fractures and, some leaders say, present a more diverse and moderate image of their faith than the one offered by the conservative Southern Baptist Convention. 
 The three-day meeting of more than 30 groups -- known as the New Baptist Covenant Celebration, which begins on Wednesday in Atlanta -- is a result of efforts by former President Jimmy Carter to draw together long-divided Baptists. 
 The meeting's statement of shared purpose, known as its covenant, calls for Baptists to focus on their traditional values, like ''sharing the gospel of Jesus Christ,'' and to work together on social issues like fighting poverty. It does not create a new denomination.
 ''I would like to see a demonstration that Christians who have different backgrounds and different political and theological orientations and geographical locations can come together in the spirit of unity,'' Mr. Carter said, ''not just for Baptists, but for Christians all over the world.'' 
 But for other Baptists and experts on the faith, a central aim of the gathering seems to be to create a theological and political counterweight to the Southern Baptist Convention, which many of the groups that plan to attend have left. 
 Politically and theologically conservative, the Southern Baptist Convention, with 16 to 18 million members, is the largest denomination in the United States after the Roman Catholic Church.
 ''The sense is that the public image is dominated by the Southern Baptist Convention,'' said the Rev. David W. Key, director of Baptist studies at the Candler School of Theology at Emory University in Atlanta. ''It's not that the New Baptist Covenant will do the same things as the Southern Baptist Convention does. But it's about the brand name. 'Can we create a brand?' ''
 The meeting falls only days before the Super Tuesday primaries, and some Southern Baptists who are critical of the gathering have said it could be part of an effort by Democrats to court Christian voters. They cite the participation of former President Bill Clinton and former Vice President Al Gore. 
 Mr. Carter, who is a Democrat, and others said the meeting date was the earliest one that could be arranged, and they point out that the roster of speakers includes Republicans like Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Gov. Sonny Perdue of Georgia. 
 Mike Huckabee, the Republican presidential candidate and a Southern Baptist minister, had said he would attend but backed out last year because he said he disagreed with comments Mr. Carter had made about President Bush. It is unclear whether any presidential candidates will address the gathering.
 Among the religious organizations in attendance will be the four major black Baptist conventions, which three years ago came together to fashion their first united stand in almost a century on social and economic issues and to bury past differences. 
 Other groups include those that split with the Southern Baptist Convention over slavery in the 1800s and those that departed more recently because of the increasingly conservative slant of the denomination in modern times. That shift ushered in a more conservative theology that focuses on issues like abortion and gay rights. Southern Baptists also assert that only men can be church pastors and leaders of the household, which was another issue that alienated some adherents. 
 ''The first thing to recognize is that the Southern Baptist Convention has moved very much to the right, became very fundamentalist, embraced certain American cultural values as though ordained by God and married the Religious Right,'' said the Rev. Tony Campolo, an American Baptist minister and a speaker at the gathering. 
 Mr. Carter said Southern Baptist leaders had attended previous meetings he had organized. While some Southern Baptists and state organizations will be at the gathering, no leaders will attend. 
 The covenant's association with Mr. Carter and Mr. Clinton, who are unpopular with many Southern Baptists, is also keeping many away, said Richard Land, the top public policy official of the Southern Baptist Convention.
 ''This is part of the continuing search for significance by those who lost in the struggle for control of the Southern Baptist Convention,'' Mr. Land said.
 The challenge for those at the meeting will be to take concrete action on issues identified as priorities, supporters and critics said. Mr. Carter said he hoped to call a meeting after Easter to plan the next steps.
 ''If this meeting is about shaking a fist at evangelicals and the Southern Baptist Convention, it will have a very short shelf life,'' said Curtis W. Freeman, director of the Baptist House of Studies at Duke Divinity School, who will be attending the gathering. ''Then it becomes about anger and pride. It becomes the negative motivation of trying to say what we are not. What I like about this particular meeting is there are positive steps we as Baptists can take together.''

HEADLINE: Saving Sears Doesn't Look Easy Anymore

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON, MICHAEL BARBARO and GERALDINE FABRIKANT; Jenny Anderson contributed reporting.

 BODY:
This article was reported by Gretchen Morgenson, Michael Barbaro and Geraldine Fabrikant and written by Ms. Morgenson. 
 BY all accounts, Edward S. Lampert, the billionaire hedge fund manager whose investment savvy earned him renown as ''the next Warren Buffett,'' is a man not accustomed to rebukes.
 But that is precisely what the stock market delivered in mid-January as Sears Holdings, the Kmart and Sears combination engineered by Mr. Lampert in 2005 and his hedge fund's biggest holding, sank to $86.02 a share. It was a level last seen three years ago, just after the ballyhooed merger was announced, and far below the stock's peak of $193 in April 2007. In the course of nine months, $14 billion in market value had evaporated. 
 So it was perhaps not surprising that last week Sears Holdings announced a revamping plan that would divide the company into five units to ''simplify the way its business lines are managed.'' Although details were scant, the stock rallied 13 percent on the news. It ended the week at $99 a share. 
 The announcement may also have been timed to precede Mr. Lampert's annual meeting with his hedge fund investors, scheduled for late next month in New York. After all, investors in his ESL Investments fund saw their holdings fall 26 percent last year. Although it was only the second down year for him since he started his hedge fund in 1988, some of his investors privately acknowledge that they are worried. At 48 percent of the shares outstanding, Mr. Lampert's stake in Sears is the biggest in his fund, a portfolio recently estimated to be worth $11.5 billion.
 Has Mr. Lampert lost his Midas touch? His woes, unlike those of most other investment managers, cannot be attributed solely to market turbulence and wrong-way bets that may soon right themselves. Much of the loss absorbed by his investors last year was a direct result of his hands-on management at Sears Holdings. 
 Since combining the two retailers, Mr. Lampert, 45, has raised prices even as he has cut capital spending and marketing budgets. The dearth of investment shows up in stores, many of which look shabby next to those of rivals like Target and J. C. Penney. Mr. Lampert's major use of cash has been to buy back Sears Holdings' shares.
 And in 2008 he faces three problems that were only partly evident last year: belt-tightening by consumers, a falling housing market and a possible recession. ''Sears is woefully unprepared to handle this kind of consumer spending slowdown,'' said Bill Dreher, an analyst at Deutsche Bank Securities. ''The underinvestment in stores has hurt sales, hurt customer good will and will hurt their long-term competitiveness.'' 
 Mr. Lampert, through a spokesman, declined to be interviewed for this article. But a handful of his hedge fund investors, several retailing analysts and a host of people who have worked alongside Mr. Lampert over the years spoke about his operations and results, although some asked not to be identified in order to preserve business relationships with Mr. Lampert. 
 Just a year ago, shares of Sears Holdings were marching to their all-time high. Other big positions amassed by Mr. Lampert -- in Autonation, a car dealership chain, and in Autozone, a car parts retailer -- were firing on all cylinders. 
 Now they're stalled or moving in reverse. While shares of Autozone rose 3.7 percent last year, Autonation stock ended 2007 down 27 percent. Last spring, Mr. Lampert made another big bet, on shares of Citigroup, which are also down significantly. Some analysts say Mr. Lampert's misfires at Sears and Kmart may reflect his earlier success at Autozone, where he used the same cost-cutting strategy and generated enviable profit increases. But selling windshield wiper blades and brake hose plugs to do-it-yourself auto enthusiasts is different from creating an inviting shopping experience for home furnishings, jewelry or clothing.
 The announcement last week that Sears would simplify its business units did not impress Carol Levenson, a credit analyst at Gimme Credit, an independent research firm in Chicago. 
 ''We just can't avoid the cliche 'rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic' when considering the proposed new operating structure for Sears,'' she wrote in a note to clients. ''The goal of making the merged Kmart and Sears into a retailing success has become increasingly less achievable, as same-store sales plunge and excuses abound.''
 The stock's collapse last year -- down 40 percent -- reflects deteriorating operations at both Sears and Kmart, together the nation's third-largest retailer, generating $52 billion in sales during the past four quarters. For the first nine months of 2007, the most recent period for which figures are available, sales fell 3.4 percent and operating income declined 31 percent for the combined companies.
 Same-store sales, a closely watched measure of financial performance for any retailer, also fell throughout 2007. During the crucial holiday season, same-store sales at Sears -- those for stores open at least a year -- fell 2.8 percent, while Kmart's dropped 4.2 percent. 
 Most rivals of Sears and of Kmart showed similar results during the holiday period. Same-store sales at Macy's fell 1 percent in November and December, for example, while those at Target dropped 5 percent in December. Wal-Mart was a standout: its same-store sales rose 2.7 percent that month. 
 Based on figures provided by the company, Mr. Dreher estimates that earnings at Sears before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization -- the figure that Mr. Lampert says best measures the company's performance -- will drop to $1.94 billion in 2008 from $2.49 billion in 2007. 
 If he is right, it will mean that Mr. Lampert's combination of Sears and Kmart, after rising for a few years, will have fallen back to the same level of profitability that both companies showed before they got hitched. 
 SUCH a round trip was not what investors had in mind when Mr. Lampert combined the companies in 2005. Confident in his ability to increase profit for Sears as he had for Autozone, and certain that the Sears real estate holdings alone were worth more than $150 a share, investors bid up Sears Holdings to almost $200 a share last April. 
 When Mr. Lampert announced the Sears-Kmart merger, his plan for the combined companies seemed simple: Marry the strength of the world-renowned Sears brands, like Kenmore appliances and Craftsman tools, with the attractive locations of Kmart stores. Mr. Lampert had bought Kmart on the cheap in 2003, when it emerged from bankruptcy. 
 ''We're going to work toward best-in-class financial metrics and best-in-class customer metrics,'' Mr. Lampert said when announcing the deal in November 2004. Analysts praised the merger, contending that economies of scale in the combined companies would translate into increased profits.
 But three years later, neither financial metrics nor those related to the company's customers can be considered best in class. The gross margins of Sears Holdings, for example, were expected to expand under Mr. Lampert's influence just as they had at Autozone when he was its biggest investor. But the gross margin rate of Sears fell during the first nine months of 2007 to 27.7 percent, from 28.2 percent in the period a year earlier. 
 And in spite of the fact that Sears spent almost $3 billion buying back its own stock and reducing shares outstanding, net income per share fell 38 percent for the first three quarters of last year from the comparable period in 2006. 
 The problem, analysts say, boils down to this: Customers are avoiding Sears stores in droves. Indeed, at many Sears stores, clerks at times seem to outnumber shoppers. 
 The Sears Essentials strategy, now called Sears Grand, offers a case in point. This was a plan by Mr. Lampert to compete with the new breed of smaller strip shopping centers, anchored by stores like Best Buy, Home Depot and Target. Sears stores, found mostly in enclosed malls, were losing prized customers to the smaller centers. But by converting Kmart stores, which were near the smaller centers, into Sears Essentials, the company hoped to lure shoppers back to buy Kenmore washers, Craftsman tools and Diehard car batteries. 
 ''I have always believed that Kmart customers had the inclination to buy more valuable products at Kmart if presented with the right value offerings,'' Mr. Lampert wrote in a letter to shareholders in late 2005. 
 But Sears Essentials flopped. It was not because Kmart shoppers rejected Sears products, but because the experiment seemed to consist only of tossing Kenmore stoves and Craftsman hammers into an old Kmart store, rather than creating a vibrant new shopping experience. 
 The former Kmart in Parsippany, N.J., is typical. Three years ago, it was converted into a Sears Essentials store. By all accounts, the store could have been a success; it sits in a bustling suburban shopping center, surrounded by popular retailers like a ShopRite grocery store and a Bed Bath and Beyond.
 But beyond introducing new brands, Sears invested little money in the store. In November, a visitor found mismatched floor tiles in the lobby, Reagan-era beige shelves in the food aisles and a ragged brown carpet in the clothing department. 
 Near a customer service desk, a broken pipe dripped water from the ceiling into a garbage pail. Workers said the pail, intended as a quick fix, had been in place for two weeks while they awaited repairs. They also said business in the store was terrible. 
 Burt Flickinger, a longtime retail consultant, said: ''Eddie has cut costs and raised prices for two years. But shoppers are not stupid. They figure it out and shop someplace else.''
 A Sears spokesman disputed that the stores were down at the heels but acknowledged that the company must work to ''improve the customer experience.'' He said the company has improved the profitability of the Sears Grand stores and still considers the original concept valid.
 Customers who did venture into the Parsippany store found that dozens of products -- from contact lens solution to dolls -- were sold out. The store did not have enough inventory or employees to replace them on the shelves. 
 Much of the commodity merchandise that was in stock was more expensive than at nearby competitors. A 32-ounce bottle of Gatorade was $1.59, compared with ShopRite's price of $1.25. Sears charged $4.19 for a box of Cheerios, compared with $3.29 at ShopRite.
 Rita Marra, 69, browsed but said she bought nothing. ''Everything here is twice as expensive as anywhere else I shop,'' she said. ''Even the employees complain: 'We know, we know our prices are expensive.' ''
 Analysts at Goldman Sachs have found that over the last year, average prices on nationally branded products at Sears Essentials and Kmart stores were 18 percent higher than those at Wal-Mart. ''The prices are totally out of whack,'' said Adrianne Shapira, an analyst at the firm. 
 Shoppers and workers are not the only ones complaining. Vendors who sell to Mr. Lampert say his relentless cost-cutting has steadily eroded their business at both Kmart and Sears, giving them little incentive to offer the chains their best new products. A result: a vicious circle of poor sales and second-rate merchandise. 
 ''They are not a priority with anyone,'' said the former chief executive of a major clothing manufacturer. ''Nobody wants to partner with them on a new project.''
 Several months ago, for example, executives from a well-known clothing maker met with Sears buyers to discuss their business for 2008. One executive who participated in the meeting said the Sears buyers praised the clothing company, saying that it was a top performer in its category but warning that sales of the clothing would nevertheless fall by 10 percent over the next year because traffic in the stores was declining. ''You are joking, right,'' the executive recalled thinking. ''We are a top performer and sales are down 10 percent? What is happening to the worst performers?''
 SEARS HOLDINGS' performance has alienated no less a power broker than Martha Stewart, who sells a line of home goods at Kmart. She chose to introduce a new line of furniture last fall at Macy's, a Sears competitor.
 The spokesman for Sears said, ''We have thousands of vendors and value them,'' adding that the company changes the mix periodically as any retailer does.
 Wall Street analysts and former Sears executives also express frustration that Mr. Lampert has not recruited many seasoned retail executives to the company. Only one of the Sears Holdings directors has a retailing background, and Mr. Lampert's choice for a chief executive, Aylwin B. Lewis, is a former fast food executive who oversaw chains like KFC and Taco Bell. 
 ''Eddie says this is a retail-driven turnaround, but we have not seen marquee retail executives come to the company,'' said Ms. Shapira of Goldman Sachs. ''Less savvy people than Eddie Lampert realize that retail begins with management. He doesn't seem to get it.''
 According to people with knowledge of the discussions, Mr. Lampert has put out feelers to several top retail executives, including Millard S. Drexler, the former Gap chief executive, and Allen I. Questrom, the man behind the J. C. Penney turnaround. But neither has agreed to join the company.
 Mr. Lampert's prickly personality may be part of the problem. Executives who have made the pilgrimage to his office in Greenwich, Conn. -- from where he oversees Sears Holdings, which is based in Illinois -- describe their meetings with him as impersonal, if not chilly. 
 An intensely private man, Mr. Lampert keeps chit-chat to a minimum, rarely asking a personal question or engaging, as most retail and clothing executives do, in industry gossip. 
 ''He is the iceman,'' said one clothing company's chief executive. ''There is nothing warm about him.''
 The Sears spokesman said the company has executives with significant retail experience and values that diversity.
 Mr. Lampert is also decidedly thin-skinned, scolding those who challenge the performance or strategies of Sears. He gets especially riled by those who say that he has starved Sears and Kmart, investing little money in the day-to-day business. ''When other companies manage expenses carefully, it is often characterized as a sign of good management and prudence,'' he wrote in a late November memo to Sears employees. ''In the case of Sears Holdings, meanwhile, expense controls are often cited as a root cause of poor performance.''
 STILL the question remains. Would the performance of Sears have improved if Mr. Lampert had not cut the company's capital investment? In 2004, before the merger, Sears and Kmart managers spent a combined $1.1 billion on investments like new-store openings and renovations. In 2005, Mr. Lampert took that number down to $546 million, and in 2006, capital investment at Sears Holdings fell to $513 million.
 Marketing budgets have also been cut. In 2004, the two companies spent $963 million; last year, the amount was $782 million, according to TNS Media Intelligence, a research firm, a decline of almost 20 percent.
 But Mr. Lampert has been willing to spend big money on share repurchases. In 2007 and into this month, Sears has bought some 21.3 million shares, or 13.6 percent of its outstanding stock. The company has spent $2.9 billion to retire the shares, paying $105 to $145 a share. 
 ''Poor operating performance can be disguised by aggressive share repurchases, and Lampert is very, very aggressive'' in that regard, Mr. Dreher said. He called Mr. Lampert's reorganization of Sears Holdings ''haphazard and spontaneous'' and warned that without giving the five new divisions bigger budgets to invest in stores, the changes ''could make things even more difficult.''
 Mr. Dreher added that the Sears chairman could be moving to take the company private and use the cash generated by Sears Holdings' retail operation to finance ESL Investments. 
 Mr. Dreher estimates the liquidation value of Sears Holdings to be about $150 a share, after tax, including the value of its stores and leases and its well-known consumer brands.
 Craig Schmidt, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, and Gregory Melich, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, value Sears real estate at around $16 billion. The company's market capitalization is $14 billion, as of Friday's close. One investor who has bet against Sears said he believes the real estate may be worth just $10 billion. 
 Certainly, the commercial real estate market has cooled in recent months. A retail consultant, Howard Davidowitz of Davidowitz & Associates, says he believes that the value of Sears stores is declining, as chains like Rite Aid and Macy's close stores. ''That real estate is worth a lot less than it was a year ago,'' Mr. Davidowitz said. 
 Steven Roth, who heads Vornado Realty Trust, seems also to have lost his enthusiasm for Sears stock. After buying 4.3 percent of Kmart just before the Kmart-Sears marriage, Mr. Roth has sold his stake. He did not return a phone call seeking comment.
 If Mr. Lampert finds it difficult to sell in an anemic real estate market, he will have to improve the retail operations to generate shareholder value.
 ''There is no exit strategy to my knowledge,'' said Richard Rainwater, the hedge fund manager and entrepreneur who was an early backer of Mr. Lampert. ''He will probably own it forever, and he wants to. My guess is that he has a plan. He is not going to tell you or me. My guess is that it probably makes sense financially.''
 WORRIED investors in Mr. Lampert's fund may soon press him to articulate his plan more clearly. Mr. Lampert's annual meeting with investors is scheduled for Feb. 28 in New York. 
 Still, there is no doubt that the Lampert luster has faded; comparisons to Mr. Buffett have quieted in recent months. 
 ''He did really well on Autozone,'' said Bruce Greenwald, a professor of finance and economics at Columbia University. ''Most of his stocks are retail stocks, and he has done really well with them. So he decided he was a genius at retail, and it didn't occur to him he could be wrong about it. He believed his own press.''

HEADLINE: Waving Goodbye to Hegemony

BYLINE: By PARAG KHANNA. 
Parag Khanna is a senior research fellow in the American Strategy Program of the New America Foundation. This essay is adapted from his book, ''The Second World: Empires and Influence in the New Global Order,'' to be published by Random House in March.

 BODY:
Turn on the TV today, and you could be forgiven for thinking it's 1999. Democrats and Republicans are bickering about where and how to intervene, whether to do it alone or with allies and what kind of world America should lead. Democrats believe they can hit a reset button, and Republicans believe muscular moralism is the way to go. It's as if the first decade of the 21st century didn't happen -- and almost as if history itself doesn't happen. But the distribution of power in the world has fundamentally altered over the two presidential terms of George W. Bush, both because of his policies and, more significant, despite them. Maybe the best way to understand how quickly history happens is to look just a bit ahead. 
 It is 2016, and the Hillary Clinton or John McCain or Barack Obama administration is nearing the end of its second term. America has pulled out of Iraq but has about 20,000 troops in the independent state of Kurdistan, as well as warships anchored at Bahrain and an Air Force presence in Qatar. Afghanistan is stable; Iran is nuclear. China has absorbed Taiwan and is steadily increasing its naval presence around the Pacific Rim and, from the Pakistani port of Gwadar, on the Arabian Sea. The European Union has expanded to well over 30 members and has secure oil and gas flows from North Africa, Russia and the Caspian Sea, as well as substantial nuclear energy. America's standing in the world remains in steady decline. 
 Why? Weren't we supposed to reconnect with the United Nations and reaffirm to the world that America can, and should, lead it to collective security and prosperity? Indeed, improvements to America's image may or may not occur, but either way, they mean little. Condoleezza Rice has said America has no ''permanent enemies,'' but it has no permanent friends either. Many saw the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq as the symbols of a global American imperialism; in fact, they were signs of imperial overstretch. Every expenditure has weakened America's armed forces, and each assertion of power has awakened resistance in the form of terrorist networks, insurgent groups and ''asymmetric'' weapons like suicide bombers. America's unipolar moment has inspired diplomatic and financial countermovements to block American bullying and construct an alternate world order. That new global order has arrived, and there is precious little Clinton or McCain or Obama could do to resist its growth. 
 The Geopolitical Marketplace
 At best, America's unipolar moment lasted through the 1990s, but that was also a decade adrift. The post-cold-war ''peace dividend'' was never converted into a global liberal order under American leadership. So now, rather than bestriding the globe, we are competing -- and losing -- in a geopolitical marketplace alongside the world's other superpowers: the European Union and China. This is geopolitics in the 21st century: the new Big Three. Not Russia, an increasingly depopulated expanse run by Gazprom.gov; not an incoherent Islam embroiled in internal wars; and not India, lagging decades behind China in both development and strategic appetite. The Big Three make the rules -- their own rules -- without any one of them dominating. And the others are left to choose their suitors in this post-American world. 
 The more we appreciate the differences among the American, European and Chinese worldviews, the more we will see the planetary stakes of the new global game. Previous eras of balance of power have been among European powers sharing a common culture. The cold war, too, was not truly an ''East-West'' struggle; it remained essentially a contest over Europe. What we have today, for the first time in history, is a global, multicivilizational, multipolar battle.
 In Europe's capital, Brussels, technocrats, strategists and legislators increasingly see their role as being the global balancer between America and China. Jorgo Chatzimarkakis, a German member of the European Parliament, calls it ''European patriotism.'' The Europeans play both sides, and if they do it well, they profit handsomely. It's a trend that will outlast both President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, the self-described ''friend of America,'' and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, regardless of her visiting the Crawford ranch. It may comfort American conservatives to point out that Europe still lacks a common army; the only problem is that it doesn't really need one. Europeans use intelligence and the police to apprehend radical Islamists, social policy to try to integrate restive Muslim populations and economic strength to incorporate the former Soviet Union and gradually subdue Russia. Each year European investment in Turkey grows as well, binding it closer to the E.U. even if it never becomes a member. And each year a new pipeline route opens transporting oil and gas from Libya, Algeria or Azerbaijan to Europe. What other superpower grows by an average of one country per year, with others waiting in line and begging to join? 
 Robert Kagan famously said that America hails from Mars and Europe from Venus, but in reality, Europe is more like Mercury -- carrying a big wallet. The E.U.'s market is the world's largest, European technologies more and more set the global standard and European countries give the most development assistance. And if America and China fight, the world's money will be safely invested in European banks. Many Americans scoffed at the introduction of the euro, claiming it was an overreach that would bring the collapse of the European project. Yet today, Persian Gulf oil exporters are diversifying their currency holdings into euros, and President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran has proposed that OPEC no longer price its oil in ''worthless'' dollars. President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela went on to suggest euros. It doesn't help that Congress revealed its true protectionist colors by essentially blocking the Dubai ports deal in 2006. With London taking over (again) as the world's financial capital for stock listing, it's no surprise that China's new state investment fund intends to locate its main Western offices there instead of New York. Meanwhile, America's share of global exchange reserves has dropped to 65 percent. Gisele Bundchen demands to be paid in euros, while Jay-Z drowns in 500 euro notes in a recent video. American soft power seems on the wane even at home. 
 And Europe's influence grows at America's expense. While America fumbles at nation-building, Europe spends its money and political capital on locking peripheral countries into its orbit. Many poor regions of the world have realized that they want the European dream, not the American dream. Africa wants a real African Union like the E.U.; we offer no equivalent. Activists in the Middle East want parliamentary democracy like Europe's, not American-style presidential strongman rule. Many of the foreign students we shunned after 9/11 are now in London and Berlin: twice as many Chinese study in Europe as in the U.S. We didn't educate them, so we have no claims on their brains or loyalties as we have in decades past. More broadly, America controls legacy institutions few seem to want -- like the International Monetary Fund -- while Europe excels at building new and sophisticated ones modeled on itself. The U.S. has a hard time getting its way even when it dominates summit meetings -- consider the ill-fated Free Trade Area of the Americas -- let alone when it's not even invited, as with the new East Asian Community, the region's answer to America's Apec. 
 The East Asian Community is but one example of how China is also too busy restoring its place as the world's ''Middle Kingdom'' to be distracted by the Middle Eastern disturbances that so preoccupy the United States. In America's own hemisphere, from Canada to Cuba to Chavez's Venezuela, China is cutting massive resource and investment deals. Across the globe, it is deploying tens of thousands of its own engineers, aid workers, dam-builders and covert military personnel. In Africa, China is not only securing energy supplies; it is also making major strategic investments in the financial sector. The whole world is abetting China's spectacular rise as evidenced by the ballooning share of trade in its gross domestic product -- and China is exporting weapons at a rate reminiscent of the Soviet Union during the cold war, pinning America down while filling whatever power vacuums it can find. Every country in the world currently considered a rogue state by the U.S. now enjoys a diplomatic, economic or strategic lifeline from China, Iran being the most prominent example. 
 Without firing a shot, China is doing on its southern and western peripheries what Europe is achieving to its east and south. Aided by a 35 million-strong ethnic Chinese diaspora well placed around East Asia's rising economies, a Greater Chinese Co-Prosperity Sphere has emerged. Like Europeans, Asians are insulating themselves from America's economic uncertainties. Under Japanese sponsorship, they plan to launch their own regional monetary fund, while China has slashed tariffs and increased loans to its Southeast Asian neighbors. Trade within the India-Japan-Australia triangle -- of which China sits at the center -- has surpassed trade across the Pacific.
 At the same time, a set of Asian security and diplomatic institutions is being built from the inside out, resulting in America's grip on the Pacific Rim being loosened one finger at a time. From Thailand to Indonesia to Korea, no country -- friend of America's or not -- wants political tension to upset economic growth. To the Western eye, it is a bizarre phenomenon: small Asian nation-states should be balancing against the rising China, but increasingly they rally toward it out of Asian cultural pride and an understanding of the historical-cultural reality of Chinese dominance. And in the former Soviet Central Asian countries -- the so-called Stans -- China is the new heavyweight player, its manifest destiny pushing its Han pioneers westward while pulling defunct microstates like Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, as well as oil-rich Kazakhstan, into its orbit. The Shanghai Cooperation Organization gathers these Central Asian strongmen together with China and Russia and may eventually become the ''NATO of the East.'' 
 The Big Three are the ultimate ''Frenemies.'' Twenty-first-century geopolitics will resemble nothing more than Orwell's 1984, but instead of three world powers (Oceania, Eurasia and Eastasia), we have three hemispheric pan-regions, longitudinal zones dominated by America, Europe and China. As the early 20th-century European scholars of geopolitics realized, because a vertically organized region contains all climatic zones year-round, each pan-region can be self-sufficient and build a power base from which to intrude in others' terrain. But in a globalized and shrinking world, no geography is sacrosanct. So in various ways, both overtly and under the radar, China and Europe will meddle in America's backyard, America and China will compete for African resources in Europe's southern periphery and America and Europe will seek to profit from the rapid economic growth of countries within China's growing sphere of influence. Globalization is the weapon of choice. The main battlefield is what I call ''the second world.'' 
 The Swing States
 There are plenty of statistics that will still tell the story of America's global dominance: our military spending, our share of the global economy and the like. But there are statistics, and there are trends. To really understand how quickly American power is in decline around the world, I've spent the past two years traveling in some 40 countries in the five most strategic regions of the planet -- the countries of the second world. They are not in the first-world core of the global economy, nor in its third-world periphery. Lying alongside and between the Big Three, second-world countries are the swing states that will determine which of the superpowers has the upper hand for the next generation of geopolitics. From Venezuela to Vietnam and Morocco to Malaysia, the new reality of global affairs is that there is not one way to win allies and influence countries but three: America's coalition (as in ''coalition of the willing''), Europe's consensus and China's consultative styles. The geopolitical marketplace will decide which will lead the 21st century. 
 The key second-world countries in Eastern Europe, Central Asia, South America, the Middle East and Southeast Asia are more than just ''emerging markets.'' If you include China, they hold a majority of the world's foreign-exchange reserves and savings, and their spending power is making them the global economy's most important new consumer markets and thus engines of global growth -- not replacing the United States but not dependent on it either. I.P.O.'s from the so-called BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China) alone accounted for 39 percent of the volume raised globally in 2007, just one indicator of second-world countries' rising importance in corporate finance -- even after you subtract China. When Tata of India is vying to buy Jaguar, you know the landscape of power has changed. Second-world countries are also fast becoming hubs for oil and timber, manufacturing and services, airlines and infrastructure -- all this in a geopolitical marketplace that puts their loyalty up for grabs to any of the Big Three, and increasingly to all of them at the same time. Second-world states won't be subdued: in the age of network power, they won't settle for being mere export markets. Rather, they are the places where the Big Three must invest heavily and to which they must relocate productive assets to maintain influence. 
 While traveling through the second world, I learned to see countries not as unified wholes but rather as having multiple, often disconnected, parts, some of which were on a path to rise into the first world while other, often larger, parts might remain in the third. I wondered whether globalization would accelerate these nations' becoming ever more fragmented, or if governments would step up to establish central control. Each second-world country appeared to have a fissured personality under pressures from both internal forces and neighbors. I realized that to make sense of the second world, it was necessary to assess each country from the inside out. 
 Second-world countries are distinguished from the third world by their potential: the likelihood that they will capitalize on a valuable commodity, a charismatic leader or a generous patron. Each and every second-world country matters in its own right, for its economic, strategic or diplomatic weight, and its decision to tilt toward the United States, the E.U. or China has a strong influence on what others in its region decide to do. Will an American nuclear deal with India push Pakistan even deeper into military dependence on China? Will the next set of Arab monarchs lean East or West? The second world will shape the world's balance of power as much as the superpowers themselves will. 
 In exploring just a small sample of the second world, we should start perhaps with the hardest case: Russia. Apparently stabilized and resurgent under the Kremlin-Gazprom oligarchy, why is Russia not a superpower but rather the ultimate second-world swing state? For all its muscle flexing, Russia is also disappearing. Its population decline is a staggering half million citizens per year or more, meaning it will be not much larger than Turkey by 2025 or so -- spread across a land so vast that it no longer even makes sense as a country. Travel across Russia today, and you'll find, as during Soviet times, city after city of crumbling, heatless apartment blocks and neglected elderly citizens whose value to the state diminishes with distance from Moscow. The forced Siberian migrations of the Soviet era are being voluntarily reversed as children move west to more tolerable and modern climes. Filling the vacuum they have left behind are hundreds of thousands of Chinese, literally gobbling up, plundering, outright buying and more or less annexing Russia's Far East for its timber and other natural resources. Already during the cold war it was joked that there were ''no disturbances on the Sino-Finnish border,'' a prophecy that seems ever closer to fulfillment. 
 Russia lost its western satellites almost two decades ago, and Europe, while appearing to be bullied by Russia's oil-dependent diplomacy, is staging a long-term buyout of Russia, whose economy remains roughly the size of France's. The more Europe gets its gas from North Africa and oil from Azerbaijan, the less it will rely on Russia, all the while holding the lever of being by far Russia's largest investor. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development provides the kinds of loans that help build an alternative, less corrupt private sector from below, while London and Berlin welcome Russia's billionaires, allowing the likes of Boris Berezovsky to openly campaign against Putin. The E.U. and U.S. also finance and train a pugnacious second-world block of Baltic and Balkan nations, whose activists agitate from Belarus to Uzbekistan. Privately, some E.U. officials say that annexing Russia is perfectly doable; it's just a matter of time. In the coming decades, far from restoring its Soviet-era might, Russia will have to decide whether it wishes to exist peacefully as an asset to Europe or the alternative -- becoming a petro-vassal of China. 
 Turkey, too, is a totemic second-world prize advancing through crucial moments of geopolitical truth. During the cold war, NATO was the principal vehicle for relations with Turkey, the West's listening post on the southwestern Soviet border. But with Turkey's bending over backward to avoid outright E.U. rejection, its refusal in 2003 to let the U.S. use Turkish territory as a staging point for invading Iraq marked a turning point -- away from the U.S. ''America always says it lobbies the E.U. on our behalf,'' a Turkish strategic analyst in Ankara told me, ''but all that does is make the E.U. more stringent. We don't need that kind of help anymore.''
 To be sure, Turkish pride contains elements of an aggressive neo-Ottomanism that is in tension with some E.U. standards, but this could ultimately serve as Europe's weapon to project stability into Syria, Iraq and Iran -- all of which Europe effectively borders through Turkey itself. Roads are the pathways to power, as I learned driving across Turkey in a beat-up Volkswagen a couple of summers ago. Turkey's master engineers have been boring tunnels, erecting bridges and flattening roads across the country's massive eastern realm, allowing it to assert itself over the Arab and Persian worlds both militarily and economically as Turkish merchants look as much East as West. Already joint Euro-Turkish projects have led to the opening of the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline, with a matching rail line and highway planned to buttress European influence all the way to Turkey's fraternal friend Azerbaijan on the oil-rich Caspian Sea. 
 It takes only one glance at Istanbul's shimmering skyline to realize that even if Turkey never becomes an actual E.U. member, it is becoming ever more Europeanized. Turkey receives more than $20 billion in foreign investment and more than 20 million tourists every year, the vast majority of both from E.U. countries. Ninety percent of the Turkish diaspora lives in Western Europe and sends home another $1 billion per year in remittances and investments. This remitted capital is spreading growth and development eastward in the form of new construction ventures, kilim factories and schools. With the accession of Romania and Bulgaria to the E.U. a year ago, Turkey now physically borders the E.U. (beyond its narrow frontier with Greece), symbolizing how Turkey is becoming a part of the European superpower. 
 Western diplomats have a long historical familiarity, however dramatic and tumultuous, with Russia and Turkey. But what about the Stans: landlocked but resource-rich countries run by autocrats? Ever since these nations were flung into independence by the Soviet collapse, China has steadily replaced Russia as their new patron. Trade, oil pipelines and military exercises with China under the auspices of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization make it the new organizing pole for the region, with the U.S. scrambling to maintain modest military bases in the region. (Currently it is forced to rely far too much on Afghanistan after being booted, at China's and Russia's behest, from the Karshi Khanabad base in Uzbekistan in 2005.) The challenge of getting ahead in the strategically located and energy-rich Stans is the challenge of a bidding contest in which values seem not to matter. While China buys more Kazakh oil and America bids for defense contracts, Europe offers sustained investment and holds off from giving President Nursultan Nazarbayev the high-status recognition he craves. Kazakhstan considers itself a ''strategic partner'' of just about everyone, but tell that to the Big Three, who bribe government officials to cancel the others' contracts and spy on one another through contract workers -- all in the name of preventing the others from gaining mastery over the fabled heartland of Eurasian power.
 Just one example of the lengths to which foreigners will go to stay on good terms with Nazarbayev is the current negotiation between a consortium of Western energy giants, including ENI and Exxon, and Kazakhstan's state-run oil company over the development of the Caspian's massive Kashagan oil field. At present, the consortium is coughing up at least $4 billion as well as a large hand-over of shares to compensate for delayed exploration and production -- and Kazakhstan isn't satisfied yet. The lesson from Kazakhstan, and its equally strategic but far less predictable neighbor Uzbekistan, is how fickle the second world can be, its alignments changing on a whim and causing headaches and ripple effects in all directions. To be distracted elsewhere or to lack sufficient personnel on the ground can make the difference between winning and losing a major round of the new great game.
 The Big Three dynamic is not just some distant contest by which America ensures its ability to dictate affairs on the other side of the globe. Globalization has brought the geopolitical marketplace straight to America's backyard, rapidly eroding the two-centuries-old Monroe Doctrine in the process. In truth, America called the shots in Latin America only when its southern neighbors lacked any vision of their own. Now they have at least two non-American challengers: China and Chavez. It was Simon Bolivar who fought ferociously for South America's independence from Spanish rule, and today it is the newly renamed Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela that has inspired an entire continent to bootstrap its way into the global balance of power on its own terms. Hugo Chavez, the country's clownish colonel, may last for decades to come or may die by the gun, but either way, he has called America's bluff and won, changing the rules of North-South relations in the Western hemisphere. He has emboldened and bankrolled leftist leaders across the continent, helped Argentina and others pay back and boot out the I.M.F. and sponsored a continentwide bartering scheme of oil, cattle, wheat and civil servants, reminding even those who despise him that they can stand up to the great Northern power. Chavez stands not only on the ladder of high oil prices. He relies on tacit support from Europe and hardheaded intrusion from China, the former still the country's largest investor and the latter feverishly repairing Venezuela's dilapidated oil rigs while building its own refineries. 
 But Chavez's challenge to the United States is, in inspiration, ideological, whereas the second-world shift is really structural. Even with Chavez still in power, it is Brazil that is reappearing as South America's natural leader. Alongside India and South Africa, Brazil has led the charge in global trade negotiations, sticking it to the U.S. on its steel tariffs and to Europe on its agricultural subsidies. Geographically, Brazil is nearly as close to Europe as to America and is as keen to build cars and airplanes for Europe as it is to export soy to the U.S. Furthermore, Brazil, although a loyal American ally in the cold war, wasted little time before declaring a ''strategic alliance'' with China. Their economies are remarkably complementary, with Brazil shipping iron ore, timber, zinc, beef, milk and soybeans to China and China investing in Brazil's hydroelectric dams, steel mills and shoe factories. Both China and Brazil's ambitions may soon alter the very geography of their relations, with Brazil leading an effort to construct a Trans-Oceanic Highway from the Amazon through Peru to the Pacific Coast, facilitating access for Chinese shipping tankers. Latin America has mostly been a geopolitical afterthought over the centuries, but in the 21st century, all resources will be competed for, and none are too far away. 
 The Middle East -- spanning from Morocco to Iran -- lies between the hubs of influence of the Big Three and has the largest number of second-world swing states. No doubt the thaw with Libya, brokered by America and Britain after Muammar el-Qaddafi declared he would abandon his country's nuclear pursuits in 2003, was partly motivated by growing demand for energy from a close Mediterranean neighbor. But Qaddafi is not selling out. He and his advisers have astutely parceled out production sharing agreements to a balanced assortment of American, European, Chinese and other Asian oil giants. Mindful of the history of Western oil companies' exploitation of Arabia, he -- like Chavez in Venezuela and Nazarbayev in Kazakhstan -- has also cleverly ratcheted up the pressure on foreigners to share more revenue with the regime by tweaking contracts, rounding numbers liberally and threatening expropriation. What I find in virtually every Arab country is not such nationalism, however, but rather a new Arabism aimed at spreading oil wealth within the Arab world rather than depositing it in the United States as in past oil booms. And as Egypt, Syria and other Arab states receive greater investment from the Persian Gulf and start spending more on their own, they, too, become increasingly important second-world players who can thwart the U.S. 
 Saudi Arabia, for quite some years to come still the planet's leading oil producer, is a second-world prize on par with Russia and equally up for grabs. For the past several decades, America's share of the foreign direct investment into the kingdom decisively shaped the country's foreign policy, but today the monarchy is far wiser, luring Europe and Asia to bring their investment shares toward a third each. Saudi Arabia has engaged Europe in an evolving Persian Gulf free-trade area, while it has invested close to $1 billion in Chinese oil refineries. Make no mistake: America was never all powerful only because of its military dominance; strategic leverage must have an economic basis. A major common denominator among key second-world countries is the need for each of the Big Three to put its money where its mouth is. 
 For all its historical antagonism with Saudi Arabia, Iran is playing the same swing-state game. Its diplomacy has not only managed to create discord among the U.S. and E.U. on sanctions; it has also courted China, nurturing a relationship that goes back to the Silk Road. Today Iran represents the final square in China's hopscotch maneuvering to reach the Persian Gulf overland without relying on the narrow Straits of Malacca. Already China has signed a multibillion-dollar contract for natural gas from Iran's immense North Pars field, another one for construction of oil terminals on the Caspian Sea and yet another to extend the Tehran metro -- and it has boosted shipment of ballistic-missile technology and air-defense radars to Iran. Several years of negotiation culminated in December with Sinopec sealing a deal to develop the Yadavaran oil field, with more investments from China (and others) sure to follow. The longer International Atomic Energy Agency negotiations drag on, the more likely it becomes that Iran will indeed be able to stay afloat without Western investment because of backing from China and from its second-world friends -- without giving any ground to the West.
 Interestingly, it is precisely Muslim oil-producing states -- Libya, Saudi Arabia, Iran, (mostly Muslim) Kazakhstan, Malaysia -- that seem the best at spreading their alignments across some combination of the Big Three simultaneously: getting what they want while fending off encroachment from others. America may seek Muslim allies for its image and the ''war on terror,'' but these same countries seem also to be part of what Samuel Huntington called the ''Confucian-Islamic connection.'' What is more, China is pulling off the most difficult of superpower feats: simultaneously maintaining positive ties with the world's crucial pairs of regional rivals: Venezuela and Brazil, Saudi Arabia and Iran, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, India and Pakistan. At this stage, Western diplomats have only mustered the wherewithal to quietly denounce Chinese aid policies and value-neutral alliances, but they are far from being able to do much of anything about them. 
 This applies most profoundly in China's own backyard, Southeast Asia. Some of the most dynamic countries in the region Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam are playing the superpower suitor game with admirable savvy. Chinese migrants have long pulled the strings in the region's economies even while governments sealed defense agreements with the U.S. Today, Malaysia and Thailand still perform joint military exercises with America but also buy weapons from, and have defense treaties with, China, including the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation by which Asian nations have pledged nonaggression against one another. (Indonesia, a crucial American ally during the cold war, has also been forming defense ties with China.) As one senior Malaysian diplomat put it to me, without a hint of jest, ''Creating a community is easy among the yellow and the brown but not the white.'' Tellingly, it is Vietnam, because of its violent histories with the U.S. and China, which is most eager to accept American defense contracts (and a new Intel microchip plant) to maintain its strategic balance. Vietnam, like most of the second world, doesn't want to fall into any one superpower's sphere of influence. 
 The Anti-Imperial Belt
 The new multicolor map of influence -- a Venn diagram of overlapping American, Chinese and European influence -- is a very fuzzy read. No more ''They're with us'' or ''He's our S.O.B.'' Mubarak, Musharraf, Malaysia's Mahathir and a host of other second-world leaders have set a new standard for manipulative prowess: all tell the U.S. they are its friend while busily courting all sides. 
 What is more, many second-world countries are confident enough to form anti-imperial belts of their own, building trade, technology and diplomatic axes across the (second) world from Brazil to Libya to Iran to Russia. Indeed, Russia has stealthily moved into position to construct Iran's Bushehr nuclear reactor, putting it firmly in the Chinese camp on the Iran issue, while also offering nuclear reactors to Libya and arms to Venezuela and Indonesia. Second-world countries also increasingly use sovereign-wealth funds (often financed by oil) worth trillions of dollars to throw their weight around, even bullying first-world corporations and markets. The United Arab Emirates (particularly as represented by their capital, Abu Dhabi), Saudi Arabia and Russia are rapidly climbing the ranks of foreign-exchange holders and are hardly holding back in trying to buy up large shares of Western banks (which have suddenly become bargains) and oil companies. Singapore's sovereign-wealth fund has taken a similar path. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia plans an international investment fund that will dwarf Abu Dhabi's. From Switzerland to Citigroup, a reaction is forming to limit the shares such nontransparent sovereign-wealth funds can control, showing just how quickly the second world is rising in the global power game. 
 To understand the second world, you have to start to think like a second-world country. What I have seen in these and dozens of other countries is that globalization is not synonymous with Americanization; in fact, nothing has brought about the erosion of American primacy faster than globalization. While European nations redistribute wealth to secure or maintain first-world living standards, on the battlefield of globalization second-world countries' state-backed firms either outhustle or snap up American companies, leaving their workers to fend for themselves. The second world's first priority is not to become America but to succeed by any means necessary. 
 The Non-American World
 Karl Marx and Max Weber both chastised Far Eastern cultures for being despotic, agrarian and feudal, lacking the ingredients for organizational success. Oswald Spengler saw it differently, arguing that mankind both lives and thinks in unique cultural systems, with Western ideals neither transferable nor relevant. Today the Asian landscape still features ancient civilizations but also by far the most people and, by certain measures, the most money of any region in the world. With or without America, Asia is shaping the world's destiny -- and exposing the flaws of the grand narrative of Western civilization in the process. 
 The rise of China in the East and of the European Union within the West has fundamentally altered a globe that recently appeared to have only an American gravity -- pro or anti. As Europe's and China's spirits rise with every move into new domains of influence, America's spirit is weakened. The E.U. may uphold the principles of the United Nations that America once dominated, but how much longer will it do so as its own social standards rise far above this lowest common denominator? And why should China or other Asian countries become ''responsible stakeholders,'' in former Deputy Secretary of State Robert Zoellick's words, in an American-led international order when they had no seat at the table when the rules were drafted? Even as America stumbles back toward multilateralism, others are walking away from the American game and playing by their own rules. 
 The self-deluding universalism of the American imperium -- that the world inherently needs a single leader and that American liberal ideology must be accepted as the basis of global order -- has paradoxically resulted in America quickly becoming an ever-lonelier superpower. Just as there is a geopolitical marketplace, there is a marketplace of models of success for the second world to emulate, not least the Chinese model of economic growth without political liberalization (itself an affront to Western modernization theory). As the historian Arnold Toynbee observed half a century ago, Western imperialism united the globe, but it did not assure that the West would dominate forever -- materially or morally. Despite the ''mirage of immortality'' that afflicts global empires, the only reliable rule of history is its cycles of imperial rise and decline, and as Toynbee also pithily noted, the only direction to go from the apogee of power is down. 
 The web of globalization now has three spiders. What makes America unique in this seemingly value-free contest is not its liberal democratic ideals -- which Europe may now represent better than America does -- but rather its geography. America is isolated, while Europe and China occupy two ends of the great Eurasian landmass that is the perennial center of gravity of geopolitics. When America dominated NATO and led a rigid Pacific alliance system with Japan, South Korea, Australia and Thailand, it successfully managed the Herculean task of running the world from one side of it. Now its very presence in Eurasia is tenuous; it has been shunned by the E.U. and Turkey, is unwelcome in much of the Middle East and has lost much of East Asia's confidence. ''Accidental empire'' or not, America must quickly accept and adjust to this reality. Maintaining America's empire can only get costlier in both blood and treasure. It isn't worth it, and history promises the effort will fail. It already has. 
 Would the world not be more stable if America could be reaccepted as its organizing principle and leader? It's very much too late to be asking, because the answer is unfolding before our eyes. Neither China nor the E.U. will replace the U.S. as the world's sole leader; rather all three will constantly struggle to gain influence on their own and balance one another. Europe will promote its supranational integration model as a path to resolving Mideast disputes and organizing Africa, while China will push a Beijing consensus based on respect for sovereignty and mutual economic benefit. America must make itself irresistible to stay in the game. 
 I believe that a complex, multicultural landscape filled with transnational challenges from terrorism to global warming is completely unmanageable by a single authority, whether the United States or the United Nations. Globalization resists centralization of almost any kind. Instead, what we see gradually happening in climate-change negotiations (as in Bali in December) -- and need to see more of in the areas of preventing nuclear proliferation and rebuilding failed states -- is a far greater sense of a division of labor among the Big Three, a concrete burden-sharing among them by which they are judged not by their rhetoric but the responsibilities they fulfill. The arbitrarily composed Security Council is not the place to hash out such a division of labor. Neither are any of the other multilateral bodies bogged down with weighted voting and cacophonously irrelevant voices. The big issues are for the Big Three to sort out among themselves.
 Less Can Be More
 So let's play strategy czar. You are a 21st-century Kissinger. Your task is to guide the next American president (and the one after that) from the demise of American hegemony into a world of much more diffuse governance. What do you advise, concretely, to mitigate the effects of the past decade's policies -- those that inspired defiance rather than cooperation -- and to set in motion a virtuous circle of policies that lead to global equilibrium rather than a balance of power against the U.S.? 
 First, channel your inner J.F.K. You are president, not emperor. You are commander in chief and also diplomat in chief. Your grand strategy is a global strategy, yet you must never use the phrase ''American national interest.'' (It is assumed.) Instead talk about ''global interests'' and how closely aligned American policies are with those interests. No more ''us'' versus ''them,'' only ''we.'' That means no more talk of advancing ''American values'' either. What is worth having is universal first and American second. This applies to ''democracy'' as well, where timing its implementation is as important as the principle itself. Right now, from the Middle East to Southeast Asia, the hero of the second world -- including its democracies -- is Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore. 
 We have learned the hard way that what others want for themselves trumps what we want for them -- always. Neither America nor the world needs more competing ideologies, and moralizing exhortations are only useful if they point toward goals that are actually attainable. This new attitude must be more than an act: to obey this modest, hands-off principle is what would actually make America the exceptional empire it purports to be. It would also be something every other empire in history has failed to do. 
 Second, Pentagonize the State Department. Adm. William J. Fallon, head of Central Command (Centcom), not Robert Gates, is the man really in charge of the U.S. military's primary operations. Diplomacy, too, requires the equivalent of geographic commands -- with top-notch assistant secretaries of state to manage relations in each key region without worrying about getting on the daily agenda of the secretary of state for menial approvals. Then we'll be ready to coordinate within distant areas. In some regions, our ambassadors to neighboring countries meet only once or twice a year; they need to be having weekly secure video-conferences. Regional institutions are thriving in the second world -- think Mercosur (the South American common market), the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean), the Gulf Cooperation Council in the Persian Gulf. We need high-level ambassadors at those organizations too. Taken together, this allows us to move beyond, for example, the current Millennium Challenge Account -- which amounts to one-track aid packages to individual countries already going in the right direction -- toward encouraging the kind of regional cooperation that can work in curbing both terrorism and poverty. Only if you think regionally can a success story have a demonstration effect. This approach will be crucial to the future of the Pentagon's new African command. (Until last year, African relations were managed largely by European command, or Eucom, in Germany.) Suspicions of America are running high in Africa, and a country-by-country strategy would make those suspicions worse. Finally, to achieve strategic civilian-military harmonization, we have to first get the maps straight. The State Department puts the Stans in the South and Central Asia bureau, while the Pentagon puts them within the Middle-East-focused Centcom. The Chinese divide up the world the Pentagon's way; so, too, should our own State Department. 
 Third, deploy the marchmen. Europe is boosting its common diplomatic corps, while China is deploying retired civil servants, prison laborers and Chinese teachers -- all are what the historian Arnold Toynbee called marchmen, the foot-soldiers of empire spreading values and winning loyalty. There are currently more musicians in U.S. military marching bands than there are Foreign Service officers, a fact not helped by Congress's decision to effectively freeze growth in diplomatic postings. In this context, Condoleezza Rice's ''transformational diplomacy'' is a myth: we don't have enough diplomats for core assignments, let alone solo hardship missions. We need a Peace Corps 10 times its present size, plus student exchanges, English-teaching programs and hands-on job training overseas -- with corporate sponsorship.
 That's right. In true American fashion, we must build a diplomatic-industrial complex. Europe and China all but personify business-government collusion, so let State raise money from Wall Street as it puts together regional aid and investment packages. American foreign policy must be substantially more than what the U.S. government directs. After all, the E.U. is already the world's largest aid donor, and China is rising in the aid arena as well. Plus, each has a larger population than the U.S., meaning deeper benches of recruits, and are not political targets in the present political atmosphere the way Americans abroad are. The secret weapon must be the American citizenry itself. American foundations and charities, not least the Gates and Ford Foundations, dwarf European counterparts in their humanitarian giving; if such private groups independently send more and more American volunteers armed with cash, good will and local knowledge to perform ''diplomacy of the deed,'' then the public diplomacy will take care of itself. 
 Fourth, make the global economy work for us. By resurrecting European economies, the Marshall Plan was a down payment on even greater returns in terms of purchasing American goods. For now, however, as the dollar falls, our manufacturing base declines and Americans lose control of assets to wealthier foreign funds, our scientific education, broadband access, health-care, safety and a host of other standards are all slipping down the global rankings. Given our deficits and political gridlock, the only solution is to channel global, particularly Asian, liquidity into our own public infrastructure, creating jobs and technology platforms that can keep American innovation ahead of the pack. Globalization apologizes to no one; we must stay on top of it or become its victim. 
 Fifth, convene a G-3 of the Big Three. But don't set the agenda; suggest it. These are the key issues among which to make compromises and trade-offs: climate change, energy security, weapons proliferation and rogue states. Offer more Western clean technology to China in exchange for fewer weapons and lifelines for the Sudanese tyrants and the Burmese junta. And make a joint effort with the Europeans to offer massive, irresistible packages to the people of Iran, Uzbekistan and Venezuela -- incentives for eventual regime change rather than fruitless sanctions. A Western change of tone could make China sweat. Superpowers have to learn to behave, too. 
 Taken together, all these moves could renew American competitiveness in the geopolitical marketplace -- and maybe even prove our exceptionalism. We need pragmatic incremental steps like the above to deliver tangible gains to people beyond our shores, repair our reputation, maintain harmony among the Big Three, keep the second world stable and neutral and protect our common planet. Let's hope whoever is sworn in as the next American president understands this.

HEADLINE: Paying the Price for the Fed's Success

BYLINE: By JAMES GRANT. 
James Grant, the editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer, is the author of ''Money of the Mind.''

 BODY:
HIGH finance, like some unreliable common stock, goes lower and lower. How did so many experts misjudge so badly? How could the supposedly ''contained'' subprime mortgage problem metastasize into a global financial panic (some days to the down side, other days to the up side)? And after this drama, what? 
 Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, inadvertently warned of the coming troubles four years ago. Speaking to fellow economists in Washington, he described the peace and quiet that, for 20 years, had been gradually settling over the American economy. Compared to the 1970s, recessions were mild and scarce, he noted. Inflation, that bane of yesteryear, was dormant. Economic growth was no longer spasmodic but smooth and almost predictable. The name he gave to these manifold blessings was the Great Moderation, and he thanked the Fed, in which he then served as a governor under Alan Greenspan, for helping to bring them about. 
 But it was actually the Great Complacency that Mr. Bernanke had put his finger on. In finance, to borrow from the economist Hyman Minsky, nothing is so destabilizing as stability. The paradox is easily explained. Profit-seeking people will take more financial risk when they believe the coast is clear. By taking bigger chances, however, they unwittingly make the world unsafe all over again. 
 Anxious people don't ordinarily get in over their heads; it's the confident ones who do. And nothing builds confidence like the belief that a greater power has conquered the business cycle and laid inflation low. In such happy circumstances, a calculating human will take out a bigger mortgage, build a bigger hedge fund or attempt a gaudier corporate buyout. That is, he or she will borrow more money, or, as they say on Wall Street, lay on more leverage. 
 So Americans proceeded to borrow. Over the past decade, household indebtedness, expressed as a percentage of the value of household assets, has shot up into record territory. Watching house prices levitate, people did what they could have been expected to do. They borrowed heavily against the accretion in value they had already seen as well as the gains they hopefully anticipated. 
 There was a rub, however, and this, too, our seers and experts failed to predict. The truth was that house prices were soaring beyond the reach of the average home buyer. Bridging this widening gap brought out the worst in just about everyone who had anything to do with money from 2003 to 2007.
 Striving so mightily to make one and one add up to three or four or five, Wall Street, Main Street and Washington collectively brought us to the impasse of 2008, in which a debt crisis is superimposed on a downturn in the economy, which is overlaid on a bear market in real estate, which is conjoined with a persistent and worrying weakness in the overseas value of the dollar. As for the crackup in complex mortgage-backed securities, now at the center of the debt predicament, the global bank UBS has justly called it ''the biggest failure of ratings and risk management ever.''
 We should not forget Main Street in this 360-degree indictment of American financial practices. Fitch Ratings, shocked by the frequency of early defaults in supposedly safe mortgage structures, belatedly delved into the details of 45 individual loans it considered representative. ''The result of the analysis was disconcerting at best,'' the ratings agency admitted in a study released at the end of November, ''as there was the appearance of fraud or misrepresentation in almost every file.'' 
 It would be asking a lot of an ordinary mortal to hew to the literal truth in a mortgage application when, to the applicant, it seemed as if the money was being offered free. And for 12 full months, from mid-2003 to mid-2004, the Fed set its interest rate, the so-called overnight federal funds rate, at just 1 percent. It took this extraordinary step to ward off the risk of falling prices, or deflation, it said. It would not tolerate too little inflation, it explained, but wanted just enough. At the time, the cost of living was rising by 2 percent a year. 
 Last week, as the Fed delivered its emergency cut of three-quarters of 1 percent, dropping the funds rate to 3.5 percent, the cost of living was rising on the order of 4 percent a year. Yet inflation was almost an afterthought in the press release in which the Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank's policy-making arm, explained its surprise intervention: ''The committee expects inflation to moderate in coming quarters, but it will be necessary to continue to monitor inflation developments carefully.'' 
 If stability leads to instability, it follows that instability will eventually restore tranquillity. But first must come the tallying up of the errors, misjudgments and outright criminality that blossomed during the Great Moderation. Mr. Bernanke, in an attempt to limit the damage and hasten the healing, is likely to keep the Fed's rate low -- lower, even, than the measured inflation rate. 
 As for mortgages, the experts had agreed that house prices couldn't fall as stock prices sometimes do, and they structured their loans without a thought to any such coast-to-coast distress. If house prices do continue to fall, there will be many more defaults, and a correspondingly urgent cry for low and lower mortgage rates. 
 Nor will the credit crisis bypass corporate America. Complacent as the mortgage lenders, investment bankers designed balance sheets as if steep and prolonged recession was not just unlikely but impossible. 
 To lubricate the machinery of lending and borrowing, Mr. Bernanke is likely to make dollars increasingly plentiful. The trouble is that, while the Fed is America's central bank, the dollar is the world's currency. It lines the vaults of central banks of America's creditors, especially the up-and-coming states of Asia and the oil-soaked principalities of the Middle East. 
 Such institutions hold dollars by choice, and not a few of them chafe at the greenback's steady loss of purchasing power. For some, Tuesday's hasty rate cut might be the last straw.
 As just about nobody predicted the present troubles, humility is what becomes today's forecaster the most. So I will offer up a humble forecast. Inflation will, at length, make its way up from the bottom of the Fed's worry list to the very top. Not for years has it seemed to matter that the dollar is only a piece of paper. But, before very long, that homely fact will push itself back to the fore.

HEADLINE: Moviegoers In Seoul Will Love This Film

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
-- AN avid moviegoer, Lindsay Bern takes in a flick at her local multiplex about twice a week. But Ms. Bern, the co-owner of a Los Angeles recording studio, has recently become irritated by what she sees as a disturbing trend on the big screen: the obliteration of New York City.
 In particular, she has been annoyed by ''I Am Legend,'' the Warner Brothers hit that stars Will Smith in a post-apocalyptic Manhattan, and ''Cloverfield,'' the Paramount film about a monster that implodes the Empire State Building, tears down the Brooklyn Bridge and generally reduces the city to a smoking pile of rubble and despair.
 ''Can't they destroy another city for once?'' Ms. Bern said in an interview at a local movie theater. ''It's despicable that the studios are using the destruction of New York to sell movies to me.'' 
 Hollywood uses the stunt to sell movies all right -- but not primarily to Ms. Bern or anyone else in the United States, for that matter. If Americans go to see the Statue of Liberty's head ripped off, as they have in droves for ''Cloverfield,'' all the better. But the fans the studios are really trying to attract with such imagery are in Eastern Europe, South Korea and Latin America. 
 New York City, studio executives say, is the only United States metropolis with a skyline that is instantly recognizable the world over. (San Francisco is a possible exception, but razing a city that is already teetering on the seismic brink is not as much fun.) Aren't Americans growing a little tired of seeing the Big Apple being splattered? ''Maybe,'' a senior Paramount executive said, ''but that is what will sell it overseas.''
 To gain control over runaway costs, the movie industry is increasingly striving for a one-size-fits-all strategy when it comes to the types of films it churns out and the megawatt marketing campaigns that accompany them. But while the studios once tailored their product to the tastes of American audiences and tweaked it for the international crowd, the reverse is becoming the norm.
 Indeed, the international movie business -- of strategic importance to studios for two decades -- has become so lucrative that many movies are now built primarily to appeal to people outside the United States. Given the broad range of cultures to which movies must play, their content will become only simpler as the trend grows. It surely isn't lost on entertainment companies that complex, politically themed pictures like ''In the Valley of Elah,'' a tough sell at home, were also disastrous abroad.
 ''Clearly, international is playing a bigger role than ever in the green-light process for pictures,'' said Jeff Blake, chairman for worldwide marketing and distribution at the Columbia TriStar Motion Picture Group. ''You're having big conversations about what you can do to increase your chances overseas.''
 What sells best overseas is a simple message, preferably one that is nonverbal and can be communicated with a single dominant image. ''The Day After Tomorrow'' was an easy global sell for 20th Century Fox. (Manhattan freezes over.) But ''Spanglish,'' with its complicated story about an Anglo chef falling for a Hispanic household helper, and with a tough title to translate, was a nightmare for Sony international marketers.
 Ticket sales at theaters in the United States have declined over the last decade despite the efforts of studios and theater owners. In 2007, sales totaled $9.7 billion, up 4 percent from the previous year, according to Media by Numbers, a box-office tracking company. But the attendance figures puncture that happy story: the number of people going to the movies was flat, after a narrow increase in 2006 and three previous years of sharp declines.
 The international market, meanwhile, is sizzling. Foreign receipts for the six biggest studios rose 9 percent in 2007 from a year earlier, to $9.4 billion. While there are no reliable independent data for attendance, the number of people outside the United States going to the movies is soaring, too, partly because more modern theaters are popping up, according to Patrick Wachsberger, the co-chairman of Summit Entertainment, a boutique studio with a large foreign film sales business.
 ''Spider-Man 3'' illustrates the shift. Released last May, the movie was a low point for the series at the domestic box office when ticket sales are adjusted for inflation, according to Box Office Mojo, another tracking service. But foreign sales for the picture were the best ever for the series, totaling $554 million. 
 Spider-Man has a lot of company. Most studio movies now gross substantially more abroad than they do at home. 
 The growth overseas -- American movies made $158 million in China last year, for example, up 38 percent from 2006 -- helps explain what kinds of films show up on marquees in St. Louis and Seattle.
 Multicultural organizations routinely criticize Hollywood, saying it fails to cast many minorities in leading roles. They point to movies like ''Madea's Family Reunion,'' which featured a mainly African-American cast, that have performed well at the box office. That picture, which cost about $6 million to make, sold $63.3 million in tickets at North American theaters.
 The big studios know that these films make money, but they shy away from them in large part because multicultural casts are a hard sell overseas. ''Madea's Family Reunion'' sold only $50,939 in tickets abroad. ''Urban movies just don't travel,'' Mr. Wachsberger said.
 International movie ticket sales, in broad terms, used to be one of two things: gravy or insurance. If a film looked as if it would be a hit, studios would take a chance on how it would perform overseas, knowing that the receipts would only make them richer. If a picture was deemed a difficult sell, studios would sell off parts of the overseas distribution rights to local companies in advance, cutting the risk.
 The situation started to change in the 1990s, as companies became more global and foreign investors developed more of an appetite for the movie business. As Hollywood started relying more heavily on action extravaganzas, and as movie attendance in the United States started to drop, the business had to court a wider audience.
 WITH many markets still growing, the practice of tailoring scripts for a global audience is only going to increase, said David Maisel, the chairman of Marvel Studios.
 He should know. ''The Incredible Hulk'' from Marvel (set for a June 13 premiere) has been meticulously constructed to appeal to moviegoers across the planet. In one sequence, Dr. Bruce Banner, the scientist who transforms into a green monster when his emotions run high, travels to Brazil to search for a cure. Instead of building Brazil on a back lot, Mr. Maisel sent the production to Rio de Janeiro -- a move that could help sell the movie in South America.
 If that doesn't work, he always has a backup: The script also calls for a fight of comic book proportions in which the Hulk must call upon the hero within to save a city from ''total destruction.''
 Care to guess which city?

HEADLINE: Pakistan Shuns C.I.A. Buildup Sought by U.S.

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT and DAVID E. SANGER; Ismail Khan contributed reporting from Peshawar, Pakistan.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The top two American intelligence officials traveled secretly to Pakistan early this month to press President Pervez Musharraf to allow the Central Intelligence Agency greater latitude to operate in the tribal territories where Al Qaeda, the Taliban and other militant groups are all active, according to several officials who have been briefed on the visit. 
 But in the unannounced meetings on Jan. 9 with the two American officials -- Mike McConnell, the director of national intelligence, and Gen. Michael V. Hayden, the C.I.A. director -- Mr. Musharraf rebuffed proposals to expand any American combat presence in Pakistan, either through unilateral covert C.I.A. missions or by joint operations with Pakistani security forces. 
 Instead, Pakistan and the United States are discussing a series of other joint efforts, including increasing the number and scope of missions by armed Predator surveillance aircraft over the tribal areas, and identifying ways that the United States can speed information about people suspected of being militants to Pakistani security forces, officials said. 
 American and Pakistani officials have questioned each other in recent months about the quality and time lines of information that the United States has given to Pakistan to use in focusing on those extremists. American officials have complained that the Pakistanis are not seriously pursuing Al Qaeda in the region.
 The Jan. 9 meetings, the first visit with Mr. Musharraf by senior administration officials since the assassination of Benazir Bhutto, also included the new army chief, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, and the director of Pakistan's leading military intelligence agency, Lt. Gen. Nadeem Taj. American officials said the visit was prompted by an increasing sense of urgency at the highest levels of the United States government that Al Qaeda and the Taliban are intensifying efforts to destabilize the Pakistani government. 
 The C.I.A. has fired missiles from Predator aircraft in the tribal areas several times, with varying degrees of success. Intelligence officials said they believed that in January 2006 an airstrike narrowly missed killing Ayman al-Zawahri, the second-ranking Qaeda leader, who had attended a dinner in Damadola, a Pakistani village. 
 Pakistani authorities, in interviews, say they have more than 100,000 troops operating in the region, including a sizable force conducting what they said was a major offensive in South Waziristan. But in the White House, the Pentagon and the C.I.A., frustrations remain high, and there is concern that Mr. Musharraf's political problems will distract him from what the administration regards as its last chance to take aggressive action. 
 Despite the insistence of administration officials that the United States and Pakistan have a common goal in fighting Al Qaeda, Mr. Musharraf has made clear in public proclamations that it is far from his first priority. At the Davos World Economic Forum in Switzerland last week, Mr. Musharraf said several times that the 100,000 Pakistani troops that he said were now along the border were hunting for Taliban extremists and ''miscreants,'' but he also said there was no particular effort being put into the search for Qaeda fighters. 
 In Washington, however, the Bush administration has said that fighting terrorists, chiefly Al Qaeda, is the primary purpose of the $10 billion in American aid that has been sent to Pakistan, mostly for reimbursements for the cost of patrolling the tribal areas. President Bush has often praised Mr. Musharraf for fighting terrorism, pointing out that Al Qaeda has tried to kill the Pakistani leader. But White House officials were silent when Mr. Musharraf said this week that his efforts were focused on the Taliban, and that the main problem the United States faced was in Afghanistan, not Pakistan.
 Accounts of the discussions between Mr. Musharraf and the intelligence officials were provided by American and Pakistani officials over the past two weeks after The New York Times inquired about the secret trip. While officials confirmed some details of the discussion, much remains unknown about the continuing dialogue between Islamabad and Washington.
 The trip by Mr. McConnell and General Hayden, a 14,000-mile over-and-back visit for one day of discussions, occurred just five days after senior administration officials debated new strategies for dealing with Pakistan. No decisions were made at that meeting of the National Security Council, which gathered all of Mr. Bush's top national security officials but not the president.
 In the ensuing three weeks, however, the debate appeared to be intensifying, as senior American officials said they believed that American forces -- whether as combat troops or trainers -- could enhance the efforts of Pakistan's military in the mountainous and lawless Federally Administered Tribal Areas. 
 ''The purpose of the mission,'' a senior official said, ''was to convince Musharraf that time is ticking away,'' and that the increased attacks on Pakistan would ultimately undermine his effort to stay in office. 
 Other officials said that recent intelligence analysis indicated that Al Qaeda was now operating in the tribal areas with an impunity similar to the freedom that it had in Afghanistan before the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. 
 The C.I.A. operatives in Afghanistan and the covert Special Operations forces there have made little secret of their desire to move into the tribal areas with or without Mr. Musharraf's explicit approval. In the administration, there has been discussion of whether Mr. Bush should give orders to allow them more latitude. Mr. Musharraf has explicitly rejected that, and within days after Mr. McConnell and General Hayden's departure, he told a Singapore newspaper that any unilateral action by the United States would be regarded as an invasion. In Davos, he dismissed the idea that Americans could be effective in the tribal areas.
 On Thursday, Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said the United States was willing to send combat troops to Pakistan to conduct joint operations against Al Qaeda and other militants if the Pakistani government asked for American help. Mr. Gates said that Pakistan had not requested American assistance, and that any American troops sent to Pakistan would likely be assigned solely to train Pakistani forces. The top American commander in the region, Adm. William J. Fallon, visited Pakistan last Tuesday to discuss counterterrorism issues with senior Pakistani officials, including General Kayani.
 American and Pakistani spokesmen confirmed that the meetings between Mr. Musharraf and American intelligence officials took place, but they declined to offer any details. Pakistan's ambassador to the United States, Mahmud Ali Durrani, said in an interview that the meetings were about ''improving coordination, discussing the war on terror, and filling the gaps between intelligence and operations,'' but he declined to provide details. 
 Last Tuesday, the State Department's counterterrorism chief, Lt. Gen. Dell L. Dailey, echoed some of those concerns, telling reporters that there were gaps in what the United States knew about the threat in the tribal areas. ''We don't have enough information about what's going on there,'' said General Dailey, who retired from the Army with extensive experience in military Special Operations. ''Not on Al Qaeda. Not on foreign fighters. Not on the Taliban.'' 
 In dealing with the American requests, Mr. Musharraf is conducting a delicate balancing act. American officials contend that now, more than ever, he recognizes the need to step up the battle against extremists who are seeking to topple his government. But he also believes that if American forces are discovered operating in Pakistan, the backlash will be more than he can control, especially because the Taliban and Al Qaeda are trying to cast him as a pawn of Washington. One result appears to be a compromise: Mr. Musharraf is willing, they say, to accept training, equipment, and technical help, but has insisted that no Americans get involved in ground operations.
 Pakistani officials insist they are taking the militant threat seriously and have completed major operations in the Swat Valley to drive out extremists. In the past few days, about 1,000 Pakistan Army troops and Frontier Corps paramilitary forces have also begun a three-pronged attack against the South Waziristan stronghold of Baitullah Mehsud, a militant leader with links to Al Qaeda who is the main suspect in the assassination of Ms. Bhutto.

HEADLINE: A Former President, Back in the Thick of Politics

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

DATELINE: ST. HELENA ISLAND, S.C. 

 BODY:
When former President Bill Clinton took to the podium on Friday at the Chapman Cultural Center in Spartanburg, he told the audience a story. He said he had just inadvertently walked into the adjacent auditorium and was mortified to see that all the seats were empty. Then, he recounted, he saw a ''tech guy'' in the back of the room and said to himself, ''Well, I'll give my best speech to one guy.'' He pounded his fist. ''I'll give my best speech if it's the last thing I do today.''
 It was a more formal expression of Mr. Clinton's determined cry in 1992 that he would hunt down every last voter in New Hampshire ''until the last dog dies.'' But his determination is no less heartfelt. 
 Mr. Clinton is back in campaign mode, this time on behalf of his wife, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York, as she seeks the Democratic presidential nomination.
 It is a remarkable sight, a former president steeped in the details of campaigning. At this time of year, Mr. Clinton could be in Davos, Switzerland, mingling with his fellow global elites at the annual economic summit. Instead, he is working like a precinct captain in places called Barnwell and Walterboro and Kingstree. 
 A week ago in Las Vegas, he combed the casinos, pulling out supporters for his wife, one by one, for the Democratic caucuses in Nevada. This past week, ahead of the party's primary election on Saturday in South Carolina, he hop-scotched across the state, holding back-to-back town-hall-style meetings in which he expounds on public affairs and answers voters' questions at length. 
 Mr. Clinton finished in Myrtle Beach a few nights ago at midnight after a session that lasted three hours. And on the long drives between appearances, he works the phones, trying to win over those officials who will have superdelegate status at the Democratic National Convention. 
 Mr. Clinton may have started this campaign as a mate, but he leaves South Carolina as a running mate. He helps Mrs. Clinton cover twice the territory, plays bad cop to her good cop, sets message and maps strategy. As the campaigns pivot now to the nearly two dozen states that vote on Feb. 5, Mr. Clinton is being deployed to Missouri while Mrs. Clinton works Tennessee. 
 The double-teaming grew so pervasive here that Mrs. Clinton's chief rival, Senator Barack Obama of Illinois, lamented, ''I can't tell who I'm running against sometimes.''
 Of all his activities here, Mr. Clinton's heated comments about the Obama campaign and the media garnered the most attention and prompted a prominent Democrat to call on Mr. Clinton to ''chill.'' 
 On Saturday in Columbia, even before Mr. Obama's big victory became clear, reporters asked Mr. Clinton what it said about Mr. Obama that it ''took two people to beat him.'' Mr. Clinton dismissed the question as ''bait,'' but added: ''Jesse Jackson won South Carolina twice, in '84 and '88. And he ran a good campaign. Senator Obama has run a good campaign here, he has run a good campaign everywhere.'' Bringing up Jesse Jackson in response to a question about Mr. Obama seemed to be another way of pointing out that Mr. Obama is black and at the same time marginalizing his importance, as well as South Carolina's, since Mr. Jackson did not become the nominee.
 But while pundits debated the degree to which those comments were strategic and whether they helped or hurt Mrs. Clinton, those thrusts and parries made up only a fraction of his public appearances here, and voters were not that interested in them.
 Instead, they sat in rapt attention at Mr. Clinton's town-hall-style events, which were essentially mini lectures on public affairs. Mr. Clinton would open by discussing various issues for half an hour. Occasionally he would say, ''Hillary thinks this,'' but their views are so similar, and he spoke for her so confidently, that he rarely bothered to say where he left off and she began. 
 The voters would then respectfully ask policy questions -- about Mrs. Clinton's plans for health care, education and economic development. His detailed answers to a single question could run 15 minutes. His vantage point is sometimes paternal; at nearly every stop, he said he regretted that Mrs. Clinton's father was no longer alive ''to see his little girl run for president.''
 But the former president also gets questions that can bring an unexpected response.
 A few people have raised race-related issues. In Charleston, Mr. Clinton suggested that his wife might lose the primary to Mr. Obama because of race. ''They are getting votes, to be sure, because of their race or gender,'' he said. ''And that's why people tell me Hillary doesn't have a chance of winning here.''
 Such pronouncements help to explain why Mr. Clinton has drawn an entire press contingent chasing after him. He is officially not the candidate, of course, but he has become so enmeshed in the campaign that the candidate who is running is often called ''the Clintons.'' And that seems just fine to many of the people at these events; they often say how happy they would be to have him back in the White House.
 Mr. Clinton is frequently asked what his role there would be. As he said here Friday night, he would not be in the Cabinet because that would be illegal, and he said he didn't want to ''big foot'' the vice president or secretary of state. ''I'm perfectly content to give her my advice,'' he said.
 Then the former president made a promise. ''I will be there for her,'' he said, ''but I will not interrupt the ordinary functioning of her government. And you should not want me to.''

HEADLINE: For Speaker, Calculated Stimulus Steps

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Representative Nancy Pelosi spent her first year as speaker battling her political opponents with mixed results. Now, she has begun her second session by antagonizing some of her allies with a major economic proposal that could mark a turning point in her leadership of the House.
 Ms. Pelosi's decision to abandon central Democratic tenets of past economic recovery measures to instead funnel cash directly to more Americans is drawing criticism from some lawmakers, labor leaders and representatives of core Democratic constituencies who contend she settled for too little. 
 But her calculation was instrumental in reaching a quick accord on the $150 billion package with the Bush administration and House Republicans, an agreement that put her on a more equal policy footing with the White House and showed increasing confidence in asserting her authority.
 ''There isn't any way you are speaker for a year and don't have growth,'' said Ms. Pelosi, referring to her personal and political development as she described her rationale in trading expanded unemployment benefits and added food stamp money for making 35 million lower-income households eligible for a federal check later this year.
 The absence of those added benefits, long a cornerstone of Democratic economic dogma, has come under fire from Democrats and their allies inside and outside of Congress. Senators are promising to try to add those elements and others to the economic stimulus legislation when it moves across the Rotunda from the House, perhaps this week.
 ''It is not the way I would have designed it,'' said Senator Kent Conrad, Democrat of North Dakota and chairman of the budget committee.
 Robert Greenstein, executive director of the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said he was startled to learn that the plan negotiated by Ms. Pelosi; Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the Republican leader; and the treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., did not contain the jobless money and food stamp increase. Mr. Greenstein said those were tried-and-true methods of fueling the economy.
 ''It just didn't make any sense to me to drop out the only two things that were the immediate acting elements,'' he said.
 Ms. Pelosi, who put together the deal in a series of intense private meetings with Mr. Boehner and Mr. Paulson, said that she still supported both of those assistance programs, as she has for years, and that they could yet get an infusion of money this year. 
 But she said her intent was to try to come up with new ways to drive the economy, and she saw it as a fair bargain to force Republicans and the White House to endorse rebates going to millions of Americans who would not have qualified under the Republican proposal while cutting off refunds for high earners.
 ''This is all part of who we are,'' said Ms. Pelosi about the traditional safety net programs, ''but weighing the equities of it, I thought it was very important to act on something that was precedent-setting in terms of focus on the middle class.''
 The final agreement showed that Ms. Pelosi, often viewed as a classic liberal, is not afraid to stray from liberal orthodoxy to advance her cause. And she again demonstrated that she is willing to buck the chairman of an important committee in the process. Representative Charles B. Rangel, the New York Democrat who is chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, was unenthusiastic about the agreement and had a long and private debate with the speaker. 
 ''She was really focused, and when she focuses on something she gets it done,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, a member of the Democratic leadership. ''And she was tough.''
 Ms. Pelosi, who has said she intends to pursue a more bipartisan approach this year, said these talks were spurred by President Bush's recognition of mounting economic problems. 
 ''He needed the stimulus package,'' she said, indicating she thought Mr. Bush was late to the game. ''Any homemaker in America could have told him months ago that our country was heading for a downturn, and we needed a change in economic policy.''
 Other members of the House Democratic leadership dismissed criticism of the agreement struck by the speaker and said that Democrats last fall were already exploring remedies given signs of a faltering economy and the likelihood the decline would become a major election-year issue.
 In recounting the stimulus negotiations, one Democrat noted that Ms. Pelosi quickly forced Republicans to abandon a push to make Mr. Bush's 2001 tax cuts permanent and blocked the White House inclination to allow rebates to much more affluent households. Then she was able to get a pact on payments for those who do not earn enough to pay taxes -- an idea many Republicans find highly objectionable.
 But Mr. Boehner was willing to accept that approach in exchange for Ms. Pelosi dropping the demand for unemployment and food stamp money, two other ideologically charged issues for Republicans.
 ''She played her poker hand perfectly,'' said Representative Rahm Emanuel of Illinois, chairman of the Democratic caucus.
 But Ms. Pelosi had a hole card. As speaker, she wields the power to advance a bill on her own. If the economic stimulus talks had collapsed, she could always push a Democratic measure forward and force Republicans to get on board or oppose it in an election year. That fact was not lost on her fellow negotiators even though it was two against one.
 ''I could put a bill on the table any day,'' she said. ''So I had that kind of leverage. We all knew we had to do something for the American people. The question was what?''

HEADLINE: In the Heart of the Heart of Conspiracy

BYLINE: By DAVID OSHINSKY. 
David Oshinsky, who holds the Jack S. Blanton chair in history at the University of Texas, is the author of ''A Conspiracy So Immense: The World of Joe McCarthy.''

 BODY:
No American politician of the 20th century is more reviled by historians and opinion makers than Senator Joseph R. McCarthy, the Wisconsin Republican whose 1950s anti-Communist crusade is synonymous with witch-hunting and repression. Actually, no politician even comes close. Herbert Hoover? True, the Great Depression occurred on his watch, goes the current wisdom, but Hoover can't be blamed for a global catastrophe, and his economic programs paved the way for needed reforms. Richard Nixon? True, the Watergate scandal justified his resignation, but Nixon was a master statesman, we are reminded, whose initiatives produced detente with the Russians and an open door to China.
 For McCarthy, there's been no such balancing act. Americans have learned to view him as the nation's most dangerous modern demagogue. Pick up a dictionary and you'll find the word ''McCarthyism'' defined as ''the practice of publicizing accusations with insufficient regard to evidence'' and ''the use of unfair investigatory methods to suppress opposition.'' To be labeled a McCarthyite is akin to being called a liar or a fraud. His loudest current admirer is Ann Coulter, a fact, I suspect, that even the senator would have found unsettling. 
 My own biography of McCarthy was published in 1983. What most surprised me was the warm reception it got from hard-nosed conservatives like Pat Buchanan, who considered the book more balanced than what had come before. My final judgments on the senator did acknowledge his role in highlighting a number of security problems in the federal government, something previous writers had been reluctant to do. But I also described him as a serial slanderer who poisoned political debate, weakened government morale and made America look ridiculous in the eyes of the world. 
 A few years ago, on assignment for this newspaper, I attended a memorial service for McCarthy at his grave site in Appleton, Wis. It's an annual event, sponsored by a local group that hopes to turn the senator's birthday into a national holiday and put his likeness on a postage stamp. Most of the celebrants were elderly, and several belonged to the far-right John Birch Society. ''There aren't a lot of us still around,'' an 87-year-old McCarthy supporter told me. ''When we die, who'll be left to tell the truth about Joe?'' 
 He needn't have worried. A full-throated defense of the senator is now in the bookstores. Written by M. Stanton Evans, a conservative journalist whose roots stretch back to Barry Goldwater's 1964 presidential campaign, it carries a title, ''Blacklisted by History: The Untold Story of Senator Joe McCarthy and His Fight Against America's Enemies'' (Crown Forum, $29.95), that well explains its thesis. Though a handful of other pro-McCarthy books have appeared over the years -- the most recent being Arthur Herman's ''Joseph McCarthy: Reexamining the Life and Legacy of America's Most Hated Senator'' -- none created much interest among conservatives. But ''Blacklisted by History'' is drawing significant attention on the political right, where the reviews have ranged from gushing (The Weekly Standard) to scathing (National Review). If nothing else, Evans has forced his movement friends to look again at McCarthy. For conservatives, the crazy uncle has finally left the attic.
 Part of Evans's appeal is his boast to have unmasked the biases and distortions of previous McCarthy critics, this author included. He begins by describing a massive Russian spy operation in the United States, drawing his evidence from K.G.B. files as well as portions of the Venona project, a top-secret operation that traced Soviet intelligence traffic during World War II. Evans leaves the impression that he has uncovered fresh material, suspiciously overlooked until now. In fact, numerous scholars have used these documents to craft a thorough portrait of Communist espionage in Washington, though most believe that the worst of it was over by the late 1940s, when the F.B.I. began a crackdown on spying and a federal security program was put in place. If anything, they say, this evidence serves to reinforce the standard portrait of McCarthy as a bit player in the battle against Communist subversion, a latecomer who turned a vital crusade into a political mud bath.
 Evans disagrees, claiming that the Communist problem was very much alive in 1950, when the senator first made his charges of treason in high places. He judges McCarthy to be a skilled appraiser of loyalty and disloyalty and blames his errors, as well as those of his top aide, Roy Cohn, on ''their proclivities for multitasking, and the fact that they carried so much information in their heads.'' (Those old enough to remember this duo will find the imagery amusing.) Most important, Evans buys into the heart of the McCarthy conspiracy -- the belief that leftist elements in the Roosevelt and Truman administrations created a foreign policy to advance the spread of world Communism. 
 How else could one explain the Soviet takeover of Eastern Europe or the fall of Chiang Kai-shek to the army of Mao Zedong? ''Who lost China?'' propelled McCarthy to the national stage. Along the way, he described General George C. Marshall, the nation's most respected military commander, as a Communist dupe; urged Secretary of State Dean Acheson to seek asylum in the Soviet Union; purposely confused the names of the convicted perjurer and likely Soviet spy Alger Hiss and the 1952 Democratic presidential candidate Adlai Stevenson (''Alger -- I mean Adlai''); and called Harry Truman a ''son of a bitch'' who made his key decisions in the midnight darkness while drunk on bourbon.
 McCarthy blamed the fall of China on ''a conspiracy so immense as to dwarf any previous such venture in the history of man.'' Evans not only endorses this conspiracy but actually expands it to include ''the Eastern, internationalist faction'' of the Republican Party, ''with ties to Wall Street, large corporations, big Eastern media outlets and Ivy League establishment.'' To Evans, the conspiracy passed from president to president -- from Roosevelt and Truman to Eisenhower and even Nixon, a former McCarthyite, who ''would fall off the teeter-totter, landing with Henry Kissinger in Red China, thereafter pushing on into the mists of detente with Moscow.'' 
 This remarkable fantasy, playing upon the deepest fears of right-wing Republicans, ignores the actual United States foreign policy that gave billions of dollars in aid to Chiang, fought a brutal war in Korea against two Communist nations, propped up an anti-Communist regime in Vietnam at the cost of 58,000 American lives and refused for three decades to recognize the government of Mao. Most historians today view the ''loss'' of China for what it was: a futile American attempt to aid a corrupt and unpopular regime. And most see Truman -- the key bogeyman of the McCarthyites -- as a tough anti-Communist who protected constitutional liberties at home and American interests abroad.
 As McCarthy raged on, the perils of supporting him became apparent to all but his most rabid admirers. In 1954, Whittaker Chambers, a revered figure in conservative circles, expressed his concerns in a prophetic letter to William F. Buckley Jr. ''None of us are his enemies,'' Chambers wrote, ''but all of us ... have slowly come to question his judgment and to fear acutely that his flair for the sensational, his inaccuracies and distortions ... will lead him and us into trouble. In fact, it is no exaggeration to say that we live in terror that Senator McCarthy will one day make some irreparable blunder which will ... discredit the whole anti-Communist effort for a long while to come.''
 Fifty years have passed since the senator died of liver failure, at age 48. The fiercely negative judgments of those who lived through the McCarthy era are widely accepted today for good reason: they ring true. These judgments tell a cautionary tale, showing how a nation's legitimate concern for security in uncertain times can be turned into something partisan, repressive and cruel. McCarthy will continue to resonate on the fringes of the body politic because the conspiracy he championed -- the disloyalty of powerful elites -- goes back to the founding of our country and beyond. Redeem him? I can best respond by quoting the man himself, on another issue, near the end of his career. ''This,'' muttered the flummoxed McCarthy as the Senate moved to condemn his behavior, ''is the most unheard-of thing I ever heard of.''

HEADLINE: Hopes Pinned on Florida, Giuliani Sees Tough Week

BYLINE: By MICHAEL POWELL and MICHAEL COOPER

DATELINE: SARASOTA, Fla. 

 BODY:
How a candidate knows he is up against it: His rivals repeatedly praise his virtues and lob softball questions his way in debates. He calls himself an unusual fellow for an unusual election. And an actor stumping with him uses a tale of being cast nearly 40 years ago as a low-life gigolo to inspire wavering voters.
 This is Rudolph W. Giuliani's life on the campaign trail, just days before the Florida primary, on which, as he has fully acknowledged, he has staked his candidacy. He has even come to embrace his new status here, which is confirmed by a number of recent polls. 
 ''I like feeling like I'm an underdog,'' Mr. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City, said here Saturday morning. ''I think underdogs get a lot of sympathy -- they get a lot of support, they get a lot of interest. But who knows? Who knows if somebody is an underdog or not an underdog?''
 It is hardly unheard of for political candidates to try to bury weaker rivals by praising them. Senator John McCain of Arizona -- who was himself praised quite a bit by his rivals last summer when his campaign skidded -- called Mr. Giuliani ''an American hero'' at a debate on Thursday. The next day, Mitt Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, said he thought ''Mayor Giuliani certainly has the capacity to call on the American people to come together in a greater cause.''
 Mr. Giuliani remarked on the phenomenon at the debate, after Mr. Romney lobbed him an easy question about trade with China. ''When Mitt Romney asked me a question, notice he asked me a very nice question,'' Mr. Giuliani said, drawing laughs. ''So I think I've lulled him into a false sense of security.'' 
 It has been a tough week. After Mr. McCain announced that Senator Mel Martinez, Republican of Florida, had endorsed him and called him ''Fidel Castro's worst nightmare'' -- which could harm Mr. Giuliani's efforts to woo Cuban-American voters in Florida in Tuesday's vote -- the Giuliani campaign countered with news releases about his endorsements from a Port St. Lucie councilman and a state representative. 
 And, encroaching on Mr. Giuliani's turf, Mr. McCain was endorsed by two New York police unions -- the Captains Endowment Association and the Sergeants Benevolent Association -- at an appearance in Fort Myers.
 Asked why it had not endorsed Mr. Giuliani, Roy T. Richter, the president of the 3,000-member captains' group, said, ''Rudy was there for the country at a great time of need, but we believe John McCain is the man to lead the nation now.''
 Mr. Giuliani has stood on the sidelines recently as Mr. Romney and Mr. McCain have clashed with each other. For much of the campaign he has said that he would go after his rivals only to counter attacks against him. Then, on Friday night, he named them.
 ''Governor Romney is attacking Senator McCain for being a Washington insider with not enough expertise and understanding in economic matters,'' he said at a Republican dinner here. ''And Senator McCain is attacking Mitt Romney for being a manager, not a leader, and lacking experience in foreign policy and national security matters.''
 ''The choice is clear: Floridians deserve someone who has been tested and proven in both areas,'' he said. ''And that's me.''
 Asked later Friday about using their names, he laughed. 
 ''In this particular case, it would have been very hard to not use their names when I was trying to point out that one was pointing out a deficiency in the other,'' he said. ''I would have had to say, 'Mr. X said about Mr. Y, Mr. Y said about Mr. X,' and I would have gotten confused. It would seem easier to use their names.''
 By Saturday morning, the concrete had again yielded to the abstract.
 ''One is pointing to the other and saying, You don't know enough about the economy; the other is pointing at the first one and saying, You don't know enough about foreign policy,'' is how the distinction was drawn here Saturday morning.
 The crowds that turn out for Mr. Giuliani seem adoring enough. He drew more than 200 at the Columbia Restaurant here Saturday morning. But when he asked how many had voted early -- which his campaign has been pressing its supporters to do for two weeks -- only a few hands went up. 
 As the day went on, the Giuliani campaign began to take on the look of one of the former mayor's old 8 a.m. staff meetings at City Hall. An event in Orlando billed as a ''Women for Rudy'' rally drew some rather masculine attendees, including the former deputy mayors Peter J. Powers, Randy M. Mastro, Joseph J. Lhota, Robert M. Harding and Randy L. Levine. 
 Some of their staff members also attended, and on the risers were some of the New York reporters who covered them. And, just for a bit more New York flavor, Curtis Sliwa stopped in with some Guardian Angels. It was a little like a 10-year reunion for the class of 1998. ''We're here for one reason, and one reason only,'' Mr. Lhota said, ''and that's to have Rudy Giuliani win the Florida primary and go on to Feb. 5 to win New York.''.
 The actor Jon Voight stumped with Mr. Giuliani as well, calling him an angel sent from heaven to save New York. Mr. Voight said that in the end, he believed the voters would choose Mr. Giuliani -- just as he had won the role of Joe Buck, the aspiring gigolo in ''Midnight Cowboy,'' over a better known actor. 
 ''When people go to the polls, and they make this one little pause before they vote, and they say, Who will make the best president,'' Mr. Voight said, ''and of course they say, well of course, Rudy Giuliani -- they're going to vote for him.''

HEADLINE: Obama Carries South Carolina By Wide Margin

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY and MARJORIE CONNELLY

DATELINE: COLUMBIA, S.C. 

 BODY:
Senator Barack Obama won a commanding victory over Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton in the South Carolina Democratic primary on Saturday, drawing a wide majority of black support and one-quarter of white voters in a contest that sets the stage for a multistate fight for the party's presidential nomination.
 In a bitter campaign here infused with discussions of race, Mr. Obama's convincing victory puts him on equal footing with Mrs. Clinton -- with two wins each in early-voting states -- and gives him fresh momentum as the contest plunges into a nationwide battle over the next 10 days.
 Former Senator John Edwards, a native of South Carolina who was trying to revive his candidacy, came in third place but vowed to keep his campaign alive, despite failing to win a single state so far. 
 With 99 percent of the electoral precincts reporting, Mr. Obama had 55 percent of the vote, Mrs. Clinton had 27 percent, and Mr. Edwards had 18 percent. 
 ''Tonight, the cynics who believed that what began in the snows of Iowa was just an illusion were told a different story by the good people of South Carolina,'' Mr. Obama told a euphoric crowd here after the results came in. ''After four great contests in every corner of this country, we have the most votes, the most delegates and the most diverse coalition of Americans we've seen in a long, long time.''
 Mr. Obama did not mention his rivals by name, but alluded to his challenges ahead. ''We are up against decades of bitter partisanship that cause politicians to demonize their opponents instead of coming together,'' he said. As the crowd cheered, he added: ''It's the kind of partisanship where you're not even allowed to say that a Republican had an idea -- even if it's one you never agreed with. That kind of politics is bad for our party, it's bad for our country.''
 Shortly after the polls closed, Mrs. Clinton flew to Tennessee to hold a campaign rally as she looked ahead to the next round of contests. Her concession came in the form of a brief statement: ''We now turn our attention to the millions of Americans who will make their voices heard in Florida and the 22 states, as well as American Samoa, who will vote on Feb. 5.''
 The candidates are now taking their campaigns to states like California and New York for contests that hold vast numbers of delegates and will test their already strained budgets. But Mrs. Clinton's statement suggests that her hopes also rest partly on Florida, which holds its primary Tuesday. The state has been stripped of its delegates because the vote is being held earlier than party rules allow, and the Democrats are not campaigning there. 
 As Mr. Obama's supporters gathered in a downtown convention center here and Mrs. Clinton was on the plane to Tennessee, former President Bill Clinton gave what amounted to the campaign's concession speech, a reflection of how he emerged as the proxy candidate as his wife campaigned in other states. In that address, at a rally in Missouri, he said of Mr. Obama: ''Hillary congratulated him, and I congratulate him. Now we go to Feb. 5, when millions of Americans can finally get into the act.''
 Mr. Edwards's third-place finish raised new questions about the future of his candidacy. While he says he is intent on carrying on, he campaigned heavily in South Carolina and won this state in 2004. His failure to draw more support here raises questions about his long-term ability to capture votes among those thought to be his base. But he could play the role of delegate-collecting spoiler in the fight between Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton.
 South Carolina was selected by Democratic leaders to hold one of the opening contests in the nominating season to add racial and geographic diversity to the traditional opening states of Iowa and New Hampshire. With 45 delegates to the Democratic National Convention, split by Congressional district, it is the biggest prize so far. The South Carolina Democratic Party estimated that Mr. Obama would get 25 delegates, Mrs. Clinton would get 12, and Mr. Edwards would get 8. 
 The voting took place at the conclusion of a weeklong campaign, where issues were interwoven with discussions of race. A poignant reminder of South Carolina's historic racial divide, the Confederate flag, swayed in the cool breeze on Saturday only a few yards from where supporters waved placards for Mr. Obama, who if elected would become the nation's first black president.
 ''I did not travel around this state over the last year and see a white South Carolina or a black South Carolina,'' Mr. Obama said, speaking to a diverse crowd of supporters. ''I saw South Carolina.''
 Turnout on Saturday was estimated at a record 530,000 people, nearly 100,000 more than in the Republican primary a week ago. More than half of the Democratic voters were African-American, and surveys of voters leaving the polls suggested that their heavy turnout helped propel Mr. Obama to victory.
 Mr. Obama, who built an extensive grass-roots network across the state over the last year, received the support of about 80 percent of black voters, the exit polls showed. He also received about one-quarter of the white vote, with Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Edwards splitting the remainder.
 In particular, Mr. Obama was helped by strong support from black women, who made up 35 percent of the voters. Mrs. Clinton, with the help of her husband, had competed vigorously for black women voters, but Mr. Obama received about 80 percent of their support, according to the exit polls, conducted by Edison/Mitofsky for the National Election Pool of television networks and The Associated Press.
 A heightened anxiety about the nation's economy was at the center of the primary fight here. More than half the voters said it was the most important issue facing the country, overtaking health care or the war in Iraq.
 ''This election is about the past versus the future,'' Mr. Obama said at his victory rally in a stark portrayal of his political challenge. ''It's about whether we settle for the same divisions and distractions and drama that passes for politics today, or whether we reach for a politics of common sense and innovation -- a shared sacrifice and shared prosperity.''
 With victories in New Hampshire and Nevada for Mrs. Clinton and in Iowa and South Carolina for Mr. Obama, it appeared increasingly likely that the party's presidential nominating fight could extend well beyond Feb. 5. Even before the ballots were counted on Saturday evening, campaign workers were being dispatched to new assignments in points across the country.
 Here in South Carolina, Mrs. Clinton was supported by about 3 in 10 women over all, the exit polls showed, hampering a candidacy that is depending on female support to win states. She received support from 4 in 10 white women and 2 in 10 black women. She had competed aggressively for their vote, particularly African-Americans to offset Mr. Obama's advantages.
 White voters under the age of 40 divided their support, with almost 40 percent for Mr. Obama, and about 3 in 10 each for Mr. Edwards and Mrs. Clinton. Almost 80 percent of blacks under the age of 40 voted for Mr. Obama. 
 Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Edwards divided white voters age 40 and older equally, with about 40 percent each, according to exit polls. Among older blacks, 80 percent supported Mr. Obama.
 The South Carolina primary was the first contest of the year in which race rose to the forefront. While Mr. Obama seldom directly mentioned the historic nature of his candidacy, it was not lost on the thousands of voters who turned out to see him in all regions of the state.

HEADLINE: Agit Pop

BYLINE: Interview by DEBORAH SOLOMON

 BODY:
Q: As one of the most politically outspoken figures in American pop music, did you intend to convey any kind of message by scheduling the release of your new album, ''Detours,'' on Feb. 5, Super Tuesday? There was absolutely no correlation. Honestly, I don't know what record sales mean anymore. Some people buy it, and some people download it illegally and don't pay for it. 
 Does that bother you? I'm sad that people feel like music should be free, that the work that we do is not valued. 
 Don't you feel valued enough? It's more about consciousness. When music comes free by way of friends burning CDs, there's not that understanding of the work that goes into the making of an album.
 Your new album updates the tradition of protest music, bemoaning the havoc wrought by the Iraq war, Katrina and even economic policy. ''Gasoline'' is surely the first song about high gas prices. It's probably the first, and it could possibly be the last. It should be perceived as a futuristic song about people who would take to the streets and revolt and take back our freedom from the oppression of gas prices. 
 Last spring, you were held up as a parody of environmental correctness when you proposed restricting the use of toilet paper to one square per bathroom visit. What was that about? I think it's a fantastic and eye-opening example of how the media is operated by political figures, of how Karl Rove was humiliated in the media and how, within 24 hours, he was able to humiliate me and take any sort of credibility away from me. 
 What are you saying? You think Karl Rove leaked the toilet-paper story to the press after you and Laurie David sparred with him about global warming at the White House correspondents' dinner? I cannot tie him directly to that leak, but within 24 hours of our exchange, as we were leaving D.C., it was on the CNN ticker tape: ''Sheryl Crow has proposed that we legislate toilet paper to one square.'' 
 Did you ever actually suggest that? It was always a joke. It was part of a shtick. It was part of a comedy routine that Laurie and I were doing on the ''Stop Global Warming College Tour.'' 
 You recorded your latest album on your farm in Nashville, where you moved two years ago, after you and Lance Armstrong broke off your engagement. Why'd you choose to live in the South? I have a lot family down here. I had a house in L.A. for 20 years, and when I got diagnosed with breast cancer, I decided it was important for me to be near my family. I was about to adopt, and I wanted to have my family around to help me raise Wyatt. 
 Was there a history of breast cancer in your family? No, and that's why I am a poster child for early detection. Be diligent about mammograms. I had a lumpectomy, and then six and a half weeks of radiation. I'm in good shape now. 
 Right, you're a new single mother at age 45. I am loving every second of it. Wyatt is 8 months old. He's got a lot of personality. 
 Will you take him on the coming tour for your new album? He's already been out a little bit. He sleeps in his crib on the bus. He's passed around. He's very social. And we take the dogs -- two yellow Labs -- and it's just like taking the whole household. It's like a big traveling family circus.
 As a nine-time Grammy-Award winner, how important are prizes to you? When I won my last Grammy, I felt like, The bus is leaving in the morning, and it's time to go back to work.

HEADLINE: Change Machine

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

 BODY:
''Love is not love,'' observed Shakespeare in a sonnet, ''which alters when it alteration finds.'' That crush on constancy placed the Bard against the windiness of change, and therefore outside the raging mainstream of modern sloganeering.
 ''It's time for a change!'' boomed Gov. Thomas E. Dewey of New York at the Republican National Convention of 1948. His rallying cry inspired the partisan crowd, but Truman supporters reminded voters of Lincoln's admonition when running for re-election in 1864 -- not to ''swap horses while crossing the river'' -- which could not be overcome by the Republican counterslogan ''Change horses or drown!'' 
 Undeterred, Republicans trotted out the old time-for-a-change slogan in 1952, which met Adlai Stevenson's riposte: ''They talk of change. These days they do little else but talk of change. But where were the Republicans when the great changes of these 20 years were made? I'll tell you where they were. They were trying to stop the changes.'' But Stevenson was up against the heroic Eisenhower, and the majority went for a change in Washington.
 In their 1988 convention, it was the Democrats' turn to latch onto time-for-a-change. The retiring Ronald Reagan told the G.O.P. conventioneers his policy changes had been resisted by the ''liberal elites who now loudly proclaim that it's time for a change. . . . Well . . . we are the change.''
 In 2008, both major parties have decided to stick with -- indeed, adhere relentlessly to -- the theme of change. '' 'Change,' the word, if not the deed, keeps proliferating in both parties like kudzu,'' Frank Rich wrote in The Times two weeks ago. ''In last weekend's twin ABC debates, Mr. Obama's 14 invocations of 'change' or 'changes' were surpassed by Mrs. Clinton's 25 and nearly matched by Mitt Romney's 10.'' An Obama campaign poster reads, ''Change We Can Believe In,'' while Romney signage heralds, ''Change Begins With Us.''
 The word is so much in demand that it has acquired an agent: Romney declared he was ''the change agent that voters say they want.'' The same day, former President Bill Clinton described his wife as a ''world-class change agent'' and an Obama backer was reported deriding ''the assumption that because Bill was a change agent in 1992, that she is now a change agent in 2008.'' (If you were starting a political-talent agency in Hollywood, what would you call it?)
 Climate Change
 As a phrase, global warming is slowly, inexorably cooling, and if something is not done quickly and on a worldwide basis -- hang the cost -- the planet will be in the grip of the collocation climate change. 
 The 50th anniversary of the coinage of both global warming and global climate change came and went with no commemorative rock concerts or scientific Sanhedrins. My earliest citation of both phrases is a report in The Hammond Times (of Indiana) dated Nov. 6, 1957, about California scientists ''studying the possibility that this continued pouring forth of waste gases may upset the rather delicate carbon-dioxide balance in the earth's general atmosphere and that a large-scale global warming, with radical climate changes, may result.'' (There must be earlier citations in print, which I welcome from the Lexicographic Irregulars and will pass along.)
 For a time, the phrase global warming dominated the discussion; of late, there has been a surge in usage of climate change. Why is the phrasal competition getting hotter? Not merely the desire to be less judgmental; rather, I think, due to worldwide ensorcelling by the noun change. A Google count shows the latter percentage of change enchantment creeping up to 33 percent against the 66 percent of global warming. (But we may know more after results are in from other states on Tsunami Tuesday.)
 Regime Change
 In the old days, we used to overthrow governments; in the Era of Change, we ''bring about regime change.'' Some consider the action an affirmation of human rights, others deride it as a cuckoo coup but all embrace the phrase containing today's magical vogue word. 
 The O.E.D. tracks the phrase to 1925. It became the policy of the United States toward Saddam Hussein's dictatorship, as expressed in the Iraq Liberation Act of 1998 (though not authorizing military action) and the phrase was later popularized by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on her travels to moderate Arab states. Opponents of the Iraq war displayed bumper stickers reading, ''Regime Change Begins at Home'' in 2004, but these are seen in less profusion in this year's primaries; their future use depends on the outcome of the surge.
 Chump Change
 In the kudzu of change, chump began as a block of wood, and a person ''off his chump'' was a blockhead. But the change jingling in the chump's pocket had to do with the exchange of low-denomination money for larger coins or bills. Black English melded the two words into a phrase that is now used mainly in irony: ''A quarter of a million pounds,'' wrote The Guardian of Britain in 2001. ''As public spending goes, it's chump change.'' 
 Will the current bubble of change use be followed by its recession? Dare we hope for a change in change? As the French say. . . .

HEADLINE: Paybacks Hurt, but Some Senate Democrats Are Taking Sides Anyway

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The name of Senator Ben Nelson, a centrist Democrat from Nebraska, is regularly bandied about as a potential Democratic vice presidential pick, given his status as a former governor able to reel in those elusive independents. But it is probably safe to strike him from Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton's short list for No. 2.
 Mr. Nelson took the opportunity over the Congressional recess to endorse Senator Barack Obama as Senate Democrats became more serious about taking sides in what amounts to an intramural fight between two current colleagues and one former one, sort of the battle for class president writ large. 
 ''I think reconciliation is going to be a big part of what '09 and the years to follow will be about,'' said Mr. Nelson, citing what he described as Mr. Obama's message of unity as a motivating factor behind the endorsement. ''Nothing against the other two.''
 Senator Maria Cantwell of Washington, a 49-year-old lawmaker with style and a Seattle dot-com pedigree, would seem to be another Obama convert considering they are part of the tiny under-50 crowd in the Senate. But she flew east to Iowa to endorse Mrs. Clinton.
 ''These are going to be tough economic times, very tough, and when I think about it, I want somebody who is going to hit the ground running,'' said Ms. Cantwell, a player in Senate energy policy who pointed to $100-a-barrel oil as part of her rationale for backing Mrs. Clinton.
 The Senate is small, and its members, while they may occasionally detest, ridicule or disdain their colleagues, prefer to keep it somewhat private since they all need one another eventually. There is a reason Senate leadership elections are conducted by secret ballot -- to limit the grudges.
 But the competitive Democratic presidential primary is drawing out the preferences of some senators, creating factions and the potential for awkward moments now and in the future. Consider that Senators Charles E. Schumer of New York and Richard J. Durbin of Illinois are roommates, members of the leadership and top backers of Mrs. Clinton, of New York, and Mr. Obama, of Illinois, respectively. They haven't come to blows when the presidential fight occasionally rears its head. Yet.
 ''We understand that we each have a colleague in our state who we like, work for and respect,'' Mr. Schumer said.
 Until the eve of the Iowa caucuses, Mr. Durbin was Mr. Obama's sole Senate endorser. No one made much of his split with Mrs. Clinton since he was such an avid backer of the junior senator from his home state. The third leading Democratic candidate, former Senator John Edwards of North Carolina, who is not beloved by his former colleagues, had zero Senate backers, a level of support he maintains.
 Mrs. Clinton, on the other hand, had lined up nine colleagues. Some were natural fits like Mr. Schumer, Robert Menendez of New Jersey and Mark Pryor of Arkansas, and their public commitment was understandable as well.
 Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, a freshman from Rhode Island, was also an ''early adopter,'' to use his term, when it came to Mrs. Clinton's candidacy. Mr. Whitehouse noted that he was appointed United States attorney by former President Bill Clinton and that the Clintons had been supportive of his political career.
 ''I would have felt like a real rat if I hadn't done it, really like a louse,'' Mr. Whitehouse said. 
 But most Senate Democrats were content to remain uncommitted, and they had a convenient excuse. With two popular Democrats, Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut and Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, in the presidential mix, both committee chairmen, many Democrats professed neutrality out of respect. 
 Once it became clear that Senators Dodd and Biden would be gone after Iowa, the endorsement picture began to shift. Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota, who had been pursued by Mr. Obama as a farm-state favorite, headed to Iowa to campaign with the Illinoisan, becoming the first in a series of red-state Democrats to join the Obama cause.
 ''I just think Barack Obama is of exceptional quality and his message of bringing people together to get results is the right one,'' Mr. Conrad said. ''I am also from a very Republican state and this is my own sense of the best chance for doing well not only in my state, but around the country.''
 After Mr. Obama's triumph in Iowa, the names of other Senate Democrats about to take the plunge for Mr. Obama began to circulate. Then came New Hampshire, and operatives in both camps expected those endorsements might dry up as Mrs. Clinton regained her grip on the race. But they didn't. They came anyway: John Kerry of Massachusetts, who ran with Mr. Edwards four years ago, and Tim Johnson of South Dakota. Mr. Nelson. Claire McCaskill of Missouri. Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont.
 Even supporters of Mrs. Clinton say the endorsements were timely and helpful for Mr. Obama. First, they showed his New Hampshire loss had not scared people off, that influential fellow Democrats still considered him a credible rival to Mrs. Clinton. Second, the support from red and swing state lawmakers left the impression that some senators, like Mr. Conrad, believed Mr. Obama to be an easier sell than Mrs. Clinton outside Democratic strongholds.
 ''When you have senators from states that are not presumably blue in every election cycle support him,'' Mr. Durbin said, ''it at least raises the very sound argument that Barack is electable.''
 Most Senate Democrats remain uncommitted. Many no doubt hope the flood of Feb. 5 primaries will wash away the problem, sparing them a public choice. But if the race continues, the pressure to declare will increase. 
 It can be a tough call. Senators are rooting for the person they endorse to go on to the White House. Of course, that means the one they oppose may remain seated alongside them for the next few years.

HEADLINE: Weathering a Test of Mettle

BYLINE: By PATRICK HEALY; Marjorie Connelly contributed reporting.

DATELINE: COLUMBIA, S.C. 

 BODY:
Senator Barack Obama proved in South Carolina on Saturday that he could not only endure everything the Clinton campaign threw at him in the most confrontational week of the presidential contest so far but also draw votes across racial lines even in a Southern state.
 Still, his victory came in part because Mr. Obama was able to turn out large numbers of black voters, a dynamic that will not necessarily prove as decisive in the 22 states that hold nominating contests on Feb. 5. 
 And his share of the white vote in South Carolina, 24 percent, was lower than what he drew in Iowa or New Hampshire, raising questions about whether race will divide Democrats even as the party shows tremendous enthusiasm for its candidates.
 If the South Carolina result buoyed the Obama team, it left Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign facing a new set of questions. Her advisers' steady attacks on Mr. Obama appeared to prove fruitless, if not counterproductive, and the attack-dog role of former President Bill Clinton seemed to have backfired.
 Surveys of voters leaving the polls showed that many Democrats who believed that Mr. Clinton's role in the campaign was important ended up voting for Mr. Obama.
 Last week, Clinton advisers believed Mr. Clinton was rattling Mr. Obama and drawing his focus away from his message of moving beyond the politics of the 1990's and the Bush presidency. The results on Saturday indicated, instead, that voters were impressed with Mr. Obama's mettle and agreed with him that the Clintons ran an excessively negative campaign here.
 ''The criticism of Obama ended up really helping him going forward, I think,'' said Congressman James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, an influential black Democrat who remained neutral in the primary. ''If he ends up winning the nomination, he will definitely face an onslaught of attacks this fall, and he may look back on South Carolina as the place that toughened him up.''
 In his victory speech Saturday night, Mr. Obama indeed sounded like a candidate with a cause, saying that the fight for South Carolina produced not only a personal victory but also progress over the divisive politics of the past. His target was clear enough without his naming names.
 Yet the race is about to shift in a big way, moving from the state-by-state battle it has been to competition on a national scale. Mr. Obama has some opportunities in Feb. 5 states, among them Georgia and Tennessee, to win over large swaths of black voters as he did in South Carolina.
 But like Mrs. Clinton, he will have to show appeal in a wide variety of states -- some with liberal Democratic bases, including New York and California, and some more moderate, like Kansas; some with racially diverse populations, and some that are predominantly white.
 The third Democratic candidate, John Edwards, seemed like a fading force on Saturday night, although he won decisively among one group, white male voters. While he vowed to go on after four straight losses, a major question is whether voters who might have otherwise aligned with him might choose between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama.
 Having failed to win even in South Carolina, where he was born and where he won in 2004 when he was running for president, Mr. Edwards faces the challenge of convincing voters that in going on he is doing more than just seeking influence within the party by amassing delegates that he can eventually throw behind one of his rivals.
 Mrs. Clinton may have won the last two nominating contests, in New Hampshire and Nevada, but she is now left to decide whether she needs to reassess her strategy.
 South Carolina voters showed little taste for the Clintons' political approach. They said in exit polls that their main concern was the economy; during an all-out campaign blitz on behalf of his wife here, Mr. Clinton spent the last week highlighting Mr. Obama's record on Iraq and his recent statements about the transformational nature of Ronald Reagan's presidency.
 Mrs. Clinton's advisers were minimizing the importance of South Carolina even before polls closed, saying the primaries in Florida on Tuesday and in the swath of states on Feb. 5 were more important. But she will have to reckon with the rejection of her candidacy by black voters and the mixed support she received from white Democrats and younger voters here -- two groups that she must have by her side in order to build a cross-section of support in the coming contests.
 ''The Clintons will now have to deal with a perception of hollowness about her strategy, that she is leaving it to her husband to take care of things and allowing him to overshadow her political message,'' said Blease Graham, a professor of political science at the University of South Carolina.
 Tellingly, Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton left South Carolina on Saturday night for two states that, like this one, have moderate political constituencies that do not often embrace Democrats in presidential general elections. Mrs. Clinton flew to Tennessee to hold a rally with black voters in Nashville, while Mr. Obama was headed to Georgia.
 If South Carolina is any guide, the sizable numbers of black voters in Alabama, Georgia, and Tennessee could help Mr. Obama in the Feb. 5 primaries. And his victory Saturday may stir fresh excitement among voters there and in his home state, Illinois, as well as in other places where he is building support, like California and even Mrs. Clinton's political base in New York.
 He also has bragging rights about a new coalition of support. About as many South Carolina white men voted for Mr. Obama as for Mrs. Clinton, and about 70 percent of white voters said they would be satisfied if Mr. Obama won the Democratic nomination, according to exit polls was conducted by Edison/Mitofsky for the National Election Pool of television networks and the Associated Press.
 More than half of black voters in the state said the country was definitely ready for a black president, while only about a quarter of white voters reached the same conclusion. By contrast, about one-third of both South Carolina whites and blacks said the country is definitely ready for a women president, the exit polls showed.
 ''Obama's victory will leave him with some strong talking points -- especially that he can continue to expand his voting base into a conservative Southern state,'' said Professor Graham. ''His team comes out of this able to say that he's acceptable to white Southern men. And the Clintons come out of this facing questions about how their attack strategy seemed to fail.''

DAY OF RECKONING 
 How Hubris, Ideology, and Greed Are Tearing America Apart. 
 By Patrick J. Buchanan. 
 294 pp. Thomas Dunne Books/St. Martin's Press. $25.95. 
 For the first time since Bill Clinton's initial term in office, Patrick J. Buchanan seems as if he could plausibly compete for the Republican presidential nomination. In Iowa and elsewhere, an economic populist and Christian conservative has threatened to topple the party establishment's preferred nominees. Online, in what is sometimes called the ''money primary,'' a foreign policy noninterventionist is breaking fund-raising records. And in the national popularity contest, if those two men (Mike Huckabee and Ron Paul) could have been combined -- in a dubious but nonetheless irresistible exercise -- to form a single Buchananite candidate, that person would have acquired a front-running 25 percent of the vote in a recent New York Times/CBS News poll. 
 Of course -- and many people are surely grateful for this -- Buchanan is not running for president, and certainly not for the Republican nomination. He just seems as if he were in his new book, ''Day of Reckoning: How Hubris, Ideology, and Greed Are Tearing America Apart.'' The book is less a coherent argument than a meandering hodgepodge of what Buchanan happens to believe on a host of issues, from immigration to pre-emptive war to free trade to the threat of China. The format should be familiar to anyone (and there must be at least one of you out there) who has read a presidential campaign book or a political party platform. 
 The self-serving nature of the book begins with its epigraph, a quotation from one of Buchanan's previous books, to which the title ''Day of Reckoning'' alludes. (Yeats gets second billing, atop the introduction.) Buchanan titled one of his earlier books ''Right From the Beginning,'' and he's eager to prove his prescience once more throughout this new book. By the time he's done quoting, in blogospheric fashion, the wisdom of his earlier works (he cites ''A Republic, Not an Empire,'' ''State of Emergency'' and ''Where the Right Went Wrong'' in the first 33 pages alone), including articles in political journals like The American Conservative and The National Interest, ''Day of Reckoning'' has begun to feel like a cross between a greatest-hits anthology and ''The Patrick J. Buchanan Reader.''
 This is not to say, however, that the book is awful. Buchanan can write, and he knows how to provoke. His foreign policy prescriptions -- withdraw from NATO, abandon our commitments to Taiwan and South Korea and pretty much everywhere else in the world -- are not likely to be adopted by the nominee of either major party in 2008, but he presents them forcefully and often persuasively. They deserve a wider hearing in American politics than they are currently given, if only to challenge the adherents of the prevailing orthodoxy to question their assumptions (although it doesn't bolster Buchanan's bona fides as a terrorism expert when he twice refers to Peter Bergen, the author of ''Holy War Inc.'' and ''The Osama bin Laden I Know,'' as Peter ''Burger'').
 In fact, if the book's second, third and fourth chapters were distributed in isolation (no pun intended) to Democratic primary voters, Buchanan might find himself with a surprising chunk of support. Most Republicans, as Ron Paul has discovered, do not warm to statements like this: ''The 'cataclysmic terrorism' of 9/11 was an unpardonable atrocity. But it was not unpredictable. For terrorism is the price of empire. They were over here because we were over there.'' 
 Unfortunately, the worthwhile provocations Buchanan offers are overshadowed by his views on race and ethnicity. He believes that diversity is America's weakness, not its strength; that because of its multiethnic nature and because of an ''invasion'' from the south, ''America is indeed coming apart, decomposing, and ... the likelihood of her survival as one nation through midcentury is improbable''; and that racial differences are inherently divisive. 
 It is one thing to assert that America is not an abstract idea or a political science experiment or a philosophical creed, but an actual country with a shared culture and homeland. It is quite another to imply, very strongly, that American culture is the genetic inheritance of the descendants of white Europeans. (Buchanan opposes ''the mixing of all tribes, races and peoples'' and suggests he would support an immigration policy that would ''keep the United States predominantly Christian and European.'') It is one thing to assert that America has the right to police its borders and to regulate immigration however it sees fit. It is quite another to blame ''diversity'' for the Virginia Tech massacre. 
 Buchanan apparently thinks his views on these matters are more important than his desire for a less warlike and imperial foreign policy, which is why he refuses to keep quiet about them. And Americans, it turns out, agree with him about the significance of these opinions. That's one large reason the nation's voters -- in 1992, 1996 and 2000 -- put a pitchfork in his presidential ambitions. And if the time comes, they will no doubt gladly bear that burden once more.

HEADLINE: What's $34 Billion on Wall St.?

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr.

 BODY:
UNDER the stewardship of Dow Kim and Thomas G. Maheras, Merrill Lynch and Citigroup built positions in subprime-related securities that led to $34 billion in write-downs last year. The debacle cost chief executives their jobs and brought two of the world's premier financial institutions to their knees.
 In any other industry, Mr. Kim and Mr. Maheras would be pariahs. But in the looking-glass world of Wall Street, they -- and others like them -- are hot properties. The two executives are well on their way to reviving their careers, even as global markets shudder at the prospect that Merrill and Citigroup may report further subprime losses in the coming months. 
 Mr. Maheras, who left his job as co-president of Citigroup's investment bank this fall after being demoted, has had serious discussions with several investment banks, including Bear Stearns, about taking on a top management position, people who have been briefed on the situation said. And he has also been approached by investment firms willing to back him to the tune of $1 billion or more if he decides to start his own hedge fund, these people said. 
 Mr. Kim, who until this spring was a co-president at Merrill Lynch with oversight of the firm's trading and market operations, has been crisscrossing the globe in recent months raising money for his new hedge fund, Diamond Lake Capital. 
 The ease with which Mr. Maheras and Mr. Kim have put themselves back in play is a reminder that for many top Wall Street executives, humiliation and defeat need not result in a professional exile. And they aren't the only ones. Zoe Cruz, the Morgan Stanley co-president who was forced to leave her job after $10.8 billion in subprime losses, has been approached by investment banks, hedge funds and private equity funds about a senior management role, people briefed on those discussions say.
 ''It is always an assumption on Wall Street that it is not the individuals that lose money; it's the system,'' said Charles R. Geisst, a Wall Street historian and a finance professor at Manhattan College. ''You can fail big time, but you can also succeed big time.
 ''They think it's bad luck,'' he said, so the attitude is ''let's give them another chance.''
 The quick comebacks of these executives stand in stark contrast to the plight of the hundreds of investment bankers who have received pink slips in the last two weeks. They also illuminate a peculiar aspect of Wall Street's own version of a class divide. Senior movers and shakers often land on their feet, no matter how egregious the losses tied to them. The industry rank and file, however, from mergers-and-acquisitions bankers at Bank of America to sales executives in Citigroup's hedge-fund servicing business, see their jobs eliminated despite being far removed from the subprime crisis.
 Perhaps the most notorious example of failure leading to prosperity is John Meriwether. Ousted from Salomon Brothers in 1991 for his role in a bond trading scandal, he became a co-founder of Long Term Capital Management, the hedge fund that nearly collapsed in 1998, rattling markets worldwide. He has since founded a second fund, JWM Partners, with assets of around $3 billion. 
 More recently, Brian Hunter, the energy trader at Amaranth Advisors whose disastrous bets led to the disintegration of that $9 billion hedge fund, is now advising a private equity fund called Peak Ridge on starting a hedge fund. Howard A. Rubin, a trader at Merrill Lynch, who lost $377 million in 1987, quickly landed a job at Bear Stearns, where he had a successful career.
 But last week, as markets worldwide gyrated, lower-level bankers braced themselves for bad news. Bank of America, whose profit fell 95 percent last year from mortgage-related exposure, has said it would pare down its trading and investment banking operations and cut more than 1,000 positions. Citigroup has also laid off investment bankers in recent weeks and has said it would cut 4,200 jobs, with more expected to follow. Morgan Stanley said Thursday that it would cut 1,000 operational jobs, and Merrill Lynch was expected to reduce its staff.
 With a recession looming, the deal-making and underwriting environment is looking stagnant. Banks are cutting costs and taking a hard look at their head counts. All these developments do not bode well for bankers' chances of landing another job anytime soon.
 MR. KIM and Mr. Maheras, both 45, took different routes to the top at their respective banks. Born in South Korea, Mr. Kim received an elite education in the United States, attending the prep school Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., and earning undergraduate and graduate degrees from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.
 In 2001, Merrill's new leader at the time, E. Stanley O'Neal, plucked him from his job as a bond derivatives expert and put him in charge of the firm's bond business. A promotion followed just two years later, and he became president of Merrill's overall markets and trading operations. In taking the job, he was given a mandate by Mr. O'Neal to enhance Merrill's risk profile, and in the ensuing years, Mr. Kim's business became a prime generator of profits. One area Mr. Kim leaped into with the encouragement of Mr. O'Neal was the market for collateralized debt obligations, complex pools of securities tied to assets like subprime mortgages. Under his watch, Merrill's exposure to these securities climbed to $52 billion in 2006 from $1 billion in 2002, making the firm the top underwriter of C.D.O.'s on Wall Street.
 Always interested in running his own fund, Mr. Kim left Merrill in May 2007, just a few months before his big C.D.O. position collapsed, causing the largest losses in Merrill's history and pushing it into the arms of foreign investors. 
 In a statement, Mr. Kim said that in late 2006 he and his team put in place a program to reduce Merrill's mortgage-related securities exposure. He said that after his departure in May, he had no authority over Merrill's risk management, trading or other operations and was not consulted on those issues.
 As recently as a month ago, Mr. Kim was telling investors he planned to raise about $2.5 billion, and he highlighted his abilities as a business builder and risk manager, people briefed on his plans said. But the turbulent markets over the last month have forced Mr. Kim to scale back his ambitions, and he is no longer discussing such a sum, said people who have spoken with him.
 He has established headquarters in Midtown Manhattan but has not hired any portfolio managers, a person who had knowledge of his plans said.
 While respected for his intelligence, Mr. Kim has never been a money manager, and hedge fund experts say that his experience at Merrill could be an impediment to raising money. ''He has no track record, and the business he built wrote down billions in losses,'' said Tim Cook, the president of Kailas Capital, an investor in hedge funds. ''He has some questions to answer.''
 Mr. Maheras, the son of a Greek immigrant, is a Notre Dame graduate who got his first taste of markets as a runner on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. He started out at Salomon Brothers in 1984 and by the early 1990s had become one of Wall Street's top traders of junk bonds. By 1996, he was running Salomon's bond trading business, and after the 1997 merger of Travelers and Salomon, became a favorite of Sanford I. Weill, rising to co-president in 2007 with oversight of Citigroup's trading and bond operations.
 As the head of its large capital markets division, Mr. Maheras had broad oversight for all aspects of trading and investment.
 IN 2004 and 2005, senior executives at the bank, including Robert E. Rubin, Citi's influential director, urged it to become more actively involved with in-vogue areas like structured credit, pools of securities backed by different assets, and commodities. The buildup in C.D.O.'s began at this time, several reporting layers beneath Mr. Maheras. By 2006, Citigroup had become the second-leading underwriter of C.D.O.'s.
 Mr. Maheras declined to comment for this article, but a person who worked closely with him said that Mr. Maheras had been aware of the broad exposure, but that he, along with others, had been caught by surprise when some of the most highly rated securities imploded so quickly.
 As the size of the write-downs grew, so did pressure on Charles O. Prince III, then the chief executive, to hold someone accountable. In October, he demoted Mr. Maheras, who then chose to leave the only firm where he had ever worked. It was a move that still irks James Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, who worked closely with Mr. Maheras while they were at Citigroup and who has counseled him in recent months. 
 ''The great shame is that people are often never as good or as bad as they are held up to be,'' Mr. Dimon said. ''Tom is a class act personally and professionally.''
 Mr. Maheras has told friends that he feels horrible about the recent events. A direct, ingenuous man who lacks the guile and gloss of most bankers who have reached such a high position, he has told colleagues how upset he is that he did not discover the scale of the losses sooner, though he has not pointed fingers.
 ''I wish I could turn back the clock,'' he has told peers. ''But it happened on my watch.''
 He has said that he expects to take 6 to 12 months to weigh his next move. However, he has been courted by Wall Street firms, which may push him to take a new post sooner than he might have thought. Since leaving Citigroup, he has had conversations with chief executives at most of the large banks, people who have been briefed on his plans say. At Bear Stearns, the talks have centered on his heading the firm's trading operations, a job formerly held by the co-president, Warren Spector, who was pushed out last summer. 
 What explains such an interest? To some extent, it is personal: Mr. Kim and Mr. Maheras have a web of relationships with Wall Street's top executives. And many seasoned investors think that surviving such a crucible gives a person a degree of savoir faire and understanding of risk.
 ''People develop relationships that transcend the professional role so that they can rationalize away performance,'' said Clayton S. Rose, a former senior executive at JPMorgan who now teaches a course on corporate leadership at Harvard Business School. ''There is also a view that they have learned from their mistakes and have now figured it out.''
 RIGHTLY or wrongly, there is not likely to be such a generosity of spirit for Jean Larkin, who until recently was a sales executive in Citi's prime brokerage division. Mr. Larkin was a 17-year veteran of the firm and was coming off a profitable year for the unit, during which it increased its market share. Last week, just days before getting news of his bonus, he was laid off. Mr. Larkin, who is 43 and lives in New York, would not comment on his departure, but people who have spoken to him say he had no idea that his job was at risk. People who know him say he does not hold out high hopes of finding another job anytime soon.
 More recently, Stefan Gerhard, a mergers-and-acquisitions banker for Bank of America, was told Wednesday that his San Francisco job was being eliminated. Mr. Gerhard, 35, also declined comment on his departure, but a person who knows him said the news came as a shock -- he had been promoted from principal to managing director in December after a successful year in which he worked on several major technology deals.
 He received the news just two days before getting notice of his bonus and, people who have spoken with him said, he was offered a severance package of just 10 percent of the amount that he had been expecting to receive as his bonus. His career outlook, these people say, is gloomy, and he does not expect to make any serious effort to find work given the current industry conditions.
 ''Wall Street firms are downsizing considerably,'' said Leah Peskin, a recruiter at Cromwell Partners. ''It will be a hard year for many of those who get downsized.''

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths KLEIN, JOHN A.

 BODY:
 KLEIN--John A., President and Chief Executive Officer of People's United Bank and its parent, People's United Financial, Inc. passed away January 25 at Yale-New Haven Hospital. He was 58 years old. John leaves his wife and high school sweetheart, Carla, to whom he was married for 37 years, and his two children and their spouses: Kristen Chiodo and her husband Chuck and Eric and his wife Allison. 
He had been looking forward to the arrival of Kristen and Chuck's baby -his first grandchild -who is due to be born in February. He is also survived by his sister Patricia and her husband Daniel Snow, of Norwalk, his brother Peter, of Florida, and his mother-in-law Almira Salomonsen, of Orange. John was born in Bridgeport on March 19, 1949. He grew up in Milford and graduated from Jonathan Law High School in 1967. He attended Columbia University and graduated from the University of Connecticut in 1971. John joined what was then known as People's Savings Bank, Bridgeport in December, 1971 as a management trainee. Later, while working full time at the bank, he attended the University of Connecticut Law School at night. Following his graduation from law school in 1977, he became the bank's first in-house lawyer and was appointed its General Counsel in 1984. Over the next fifteen years, he served in a variety of positions of increasing responsibility at People's United, culminating in his appointment as Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of the bank in 1999. During his eight year tenure as Chief Executive Officer, John focused his efforts on ensuring that the bank would be able to meet the challenges of banking in the twenty-first century, while maintaining its culture and community focus. He effectively steered the bank through the difficult economy of the early 2000s, and when the bank determined it was necessary to sell its credit card business, he successfully negotiated a sale that retained the jobs in Bridgeport. Last year, John led the bank's conversion to full public stockholder ownership. The bank's new holding company, People's United Financial, Inc., raised approximately $3.4 billion in the offering, making it one of the largest stock offerings in United States history. Most recently under John's leadership, the bank completed the acquisition of Chittenden Corporation, expanding People's United to approximately $22 billion in assets and more than 300 branches in six states. John was also Chairman of the Board of the People's United Community Foundation, which he believed reflected the bank's ongoing commitment to community betterment. In addition to his involvement with the bank's outreach, John held leadership roles with a broad array of community and business organizations. These included: the board of directors of Bridgeport Hospital and YaleNew Haven Health; the Bridgeport Regional Business Council; the Greater Bridgeport Area Foundation; and The Business Council of Fairfield County. John also was a board member of the Connecticut Bankers Association, the Connecticut Business and Industry Association, and a member of the Connecticut Bar Association. Inspired by the example of his wife Carla, a longtime teacher, John was an advocate of the importance of education and, particularly, public education. He believed that a strong public educational system is critical to Connecticuts long term success and prosperity, and, as a proud graduate of the University of Connecticut (and a devoted Huskies fan), he was an enthusiastic supporter of UCONN. John was dedicated to supporting research aimed at making a difference in the fight against esophageal cancer. Following his treatment at the University of Michigan, John and Carla worked with the university to establish the John A. and Carla S. Klein Family Research Professorship in Thoracic Surgery to support a faculty member whose research focuses on diseases of the esophagus. Calling hours will take place on Monday, January 28, 2008 from 4-8pm in the Abriola Parkview Funeral Home, 419 White Plains Rd., Trumbull, CT. A memorial service will take place on Tuesday, January 29, 2008 beginning at 11am at the Klein Memorial Auditorium, 910 Fairfield Ave., Bridgeport, CT. In lieu of flowers, the family asks that donations be made to the University of Michigan in support of the John A. and Carla S. Klein Family Research Professorship in Thoracic Surgery. University of Michigan, Department of Surgery, 1500 E. Medical Center Dr., 2110 Taubman Center, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-5346. For travel directions and more information visit us at abriola.com.

 BODY:
Was Huntington Right?
 To the Editor:
In his essay about Samuel Huntington (''The Clash,'' Jan. 6), Fouad Ajami refers to a group of writers who in 1993 contributed to a special issue of Foreign Affairs concerning the Huntington thesis. I am one of those contributors -- and, unlike Ajami, I do not retract my criticism of Huntington's views about the alleged inevitability of a clash between Islam and the West. 
 As I wrote in Foreign Affairs at the time, divisions of policy within and between Muslim states prove that national sovereign interests trump religious extremism. Nor are all Muslim ruling establishments anti-West. Both Ajami and Huntington attribute unanimity to the ''Muslim world'' where it does not exist. 
 The Huntington thesis is anachronistic. It does not fit contemporary political realities in the Middle East. As current events there show, Muslim states are more divided among themselves today than ever before.
 ALBERT L. WEEKS Sarasota, Fla.
 To the Editor:
 ''It is not pretty at the frontiers between societies with dwindling populations ... and those with young people making claims on the world. Huntington saw this gathering storm,'' Ajami writes. How depressing, this bogus geopolitical approach to what is in fact a multitude of human tragedies. And what a pity the Book Review didn't temper Ajami's wrong-end-of-the-telescope observations with at least mention of recent novels about emigration from North Africa to Europe, where the human tragedies are explored in intimate detail. Laila Lalami's ''Hope and Other Dangerous Pursuits,'' Amara Lakhous's ''Clash of Civilizations Over an Elevator in Piazza Vittorio,'' Aziz Chouaki's ''Star of Algiers'' and Mahi Binebine's ''Welcome to Paradise'' come to mind among many.
 The emigrants these novelists describe are not coming to Europe under the banner of militant Islam or any banner at all; they just want to earn a living. And if they can't survive at home, demographics has less to do with it than politics. Take Algeria, where a huge trade surplus has been racked up lately from sales of oil at up to $100 a barrel, yet where millions of people still live on a dollar a day. Economic incompetence, murderous corruption and the total clampdown on civil society go a lot farther in explaining clandestine emigration from Algeria than demographics. 
 And the wretched status quo in countries like Algeria is maintained with the connivance and/or collusion of the United States, France and other trading partners, including lately Russia and China. Clash of civilizations? Alas, there is only one civilization at work here, the cult of money, and it's universal.
 Or let's accept that North Africa is rich in youth under the age of 20 and Western Europe rich in people past retirement age. Is this a threat or an opportunity? Why is the Roman Catholic Church in Italy, through its charity Caritas, a leading defender of the rights of Muslim immigrants? Is the West letting down its guard when the church defends the rights of Muslim immigrants to build mosques in Italian cities, or living up to its highest aspirations?

HEADLINE: Yemen's Deals With Jihadists Unsettle the U.S.

BYLINE: By ROBERT F. WORTH

DATELINE: SANA, Yemen 

 BODY:
When the Yemeni authorities released a convicted terrorist of Al Qaeda named Jamal al-Badawi from prison last October, American officials were furious. Mr. Badawi helped plan the attack on the American destroyer Cole in 2000, in which 17 American sailors were killed. 
 But the Yemenis saw things differently. Mr. Badawi had agreed to help track down five other members of Al Qaeda who had escaped from prison, and was more useful to the government on the street than off, said a high-level Yemeni government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Mr. Badawi had also pledged his loyalty to Yemen's president before being released, the official said. 
 The dispute over Mr. Badawi -- whom the Yemenis quickly returned to prison after being threatened with a loss of aid -- underscored a much broader disagreement over how to fight terrorism in Yemen, a particularly valuable recruiting ground and refuge for Islamist militants in the past two decades. 
 Yemeni officials say they have had considerable success co-opting jihadists like Mr. Badawi, often by releasing them from prison and helping them with money, schooling or jobs. They are required to sign a pledge not to carry out any attacks on Yemeni soil, often backed by guarantees from their tribe or family members. Many have taken part in an Islamic re-education effort led by religious scholars, now being copied on a wider scale in Saudi Arabia. 
 A number of these former jihadists have become government informants, helping to capture a new generation of younger, more dangerous Qaeda militants -- some of them veterans of the war in Iraq -- who refuse to recognize the Yemeni government. Others have become mediators, helping persuade escaped prisoners to surrender.
 But American counterterrorism officials and even some Yemenis say the Yemeni government, more than others in the region, is in effect striking a deal that helps stop attacks here while leaving jihadists largely free to plan them elsewhere. They also say the Yemeni government caters too much to radical Islamist figures to improve its political standing, nourishing a culture that could ultimately breed more violence. 
 ''Yemen is like a bus station -- we stop some terrorists, and we send others on to fight elsewhere,'' said Murad Abdul Wahed Zafir, a political analyst at the National Democratic Institute in Sana. ''We appease our partners in the West, but we are not really helping.'' 
 Uneasy Alliance With Jihadists
 All parties agree that the situation is urgent. With a young, poor, and fast-growing population of 22 million, Yemen is rapidly approaching an economic and political crisis that could result in its becoming a failed state. The government is fighting a persistent insurgency in the north, oil supplies are dwindling, and the water table in the capital is expected (according to a World Bank estimate) to run out in two years. Like Afghanistan, Yemen has a weak government with strong tribes and mountainous terrain, and a vast weapons supply. 
 The Yemeni government argues that its approach is in keeping with their deeply conservative society, where Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein remain popular figures. Although a new American-trained commando unit has regularly captured and killed terrorists, officials say they must also show restraint with prisoners: taking a harder line or acceding to American demands to extradite people like Mr. Badawi (as the United States has asked) could provoke a violent backlash. 
 ''The strategy is fighting terrorism, but we need space to use our own tactics, and our friends must understand us,'' said Rashad Muhammad al-Alimi, Yemen's interior minister. 
 Yemen's uneasy partnership with jihadists dates back to the late 1980s, when it welcomed tens of thousands of returning Arab veterans of the war against the Soviets in Afghanistan. While other Arab countries, particularly Saudi Arabia, struggled with the question of how to accommodate those jihadists, Yemen was actively open to sheltering them, said Gregory Johnsen, a security analyst at the terrorism research group Jamestown Foundation. At the time, President Ali Abdullah Saleh saw the returning fighters as a useful military and ideological weapon against the restive socialists of southern Yemen. 
 When a brief civil war broke out in 1994, President Saleh sent thousands of jihadists into battle against the south. He also forged important ties with Yemeni Islamist clerical and political figures like Sheik Abdul Majid al-Zindani, a former mentor of Mr. bin Laden who has a broad popular following and has since been listed as a ''specially designated global terrorist'' by the United States and the United Nations. 
 Those ties persist today, despite American complaints. Some American officials say the influence of Islamists, and entrenched government corruption, may have made possible the spectacular escape of 23 Qaeda figures, including Mr. Badawi, from a well-guarded prison in the capital in February 2006. Yemeni officials blamed poor oversight for the escape, in which the prisoners are said to have tunneled their way to the bathroom of a neighboring mosque. 
 Finding a Balance After 2001
 After the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, Mr. Saleh flew to Washington and pledged full cooperation with American antiterrorism efforts. At home in Yemen, thousands of former ''Afghan Arabs'' were rounded up and imprisoned. 
 But Mr. Saleh was still sensitive to Islamic extremists, who remained a crucial domestic constituency. When the Pentagon leaked word of Yemeni collaboration in an American missile strike in 2002 that killed the suspected leader of Al Qaeda in Yemen, Mr. Saleh was furious. 
 That same year, Mr. Saleh hit on an idea that he hoped would satisfy both his American and Islamist partners: ''al hiwar al fikri,'' or intellectual dialogue. This was an effort to inculcate the idea that Islam, properly understood, does not condone terrorism. Sessions began with hundreds of former jihadists who remained in prison without charges. 
 ''It came from the idea that terror depends on ideology, and that thought should be confronted with thought,'' said Hamoud al Hetar, the cleric and judge who led the program. 
 A cleric would sit for several hours with three to seven prisoners, mostly outside the prison, and discuss Islamic law and ethics, Judge Hetar said during an interview at his home in Sana. 
 At first, the Saudis and others derided the idea as too soft. At the same time, many Yemeni religious scholars refused to participate out of fear that they would be assassinated by militants, Judge Hetar said. Gradually the program gained acceptance, and Saudi Arabia soon adopted its own version, including therapy and a more comprehensive reintegration program. 
 Some critics have dismissed the dialogue program, which lapsed in 2005 after terror attacks dropped off, as a sham in which inmates feigned conversion to get out of prison. But Nasser al-Bahri, a former driver for Mr. bin Laden who spent four years with Al Qaeda in Afghanistan, said it was more like a raw bargain: exempt Yemen from your jihad and you will be left alone. 
 ''It changed their behavior, not their thoughts,'' said Mr. Bahri, a cheerful, talkative 33-year-old who once went by the nom de guerre Abu Jandal. ''Judge Hetar cannot cancel jihad. It is in the roots of our religion.'' 
 Sitting on the floor of a bare living room in his Sana apartment, Mr. Bahri said the government helped him buy a taxi and pay for business school after his release in 2003. Although he says he still supports Al Qaeda's global goals, he also urges other Islamists to avoid any violence in Yemen. 
 Ali Saleh, anotherformer jihadist who went through Judge Hetar's program while in prison, now serves as a mediator between the government and Islamists. He helped negotiate the surrender of several of the 23 men who escaped from prison in Sana in early 2006. In exchange, the government agreed to make concessions, including releasing the men after their surrender, he said. 
 ''The government understands, in Yemen you must compromise to reach a solution,'' Mr. Saleh said. ''The Americans would like to put us all in jail. But if you do this, 10 men will become 20, 20 will become 100, and then -- we will be an army.'' 
 A More Violent Generation
 Some former jihadists also work as informants for the government and have helped foil a number of attacks, Yemeni officials said. 
 There appears to be a limit, however, to the government's ability to co-opt Islamists. A new, more violent generation of militants has emerged in Yemen, according to Yemeni officials and older members of the jihadist community. 
 Some of these younger men have fought in Iraq, and they refuse all dialogue, seeing Yemen's government as illegitimate. They appear to have been responsible for the suicide bombing in Marib Province last July in which eight Spanish tourists were killed, and two other suicide attacks on oil installations in 2006. Recently, there have been warnings of more attacks in Yemen on Islamist Web sites. 
 ''They opened a door we hoped would be closed forever,'' Mr. Bahri said.
 The younger men also see older figures like Mr. Bahri, despite his association with Mr. bin Laden, as traitors. Mr. Bahri said Yemeni security men had showed him a ''death list'' of 30 names written by members of this younger generation, with his name at the top.
 Last summer, two Internet statements claiming to be from Al Qaeda in Yemen lamented that ''some of the people abandoned their principles and turned to the government.'' The statement accurately describes the mediating committee on which Ali Saleh serves, and goes on to say, ''Those deserters became the government's hands; some of them turned into their spies,'' according to a translation provided by the SITE Institute. 
 Mr. Bahri said he has tried to reason with members of the younger generation of militants, but they refuse all dialogue. He and Mr. Saleh, the mediator, now carry a weapon at all times, and fear for their safety, Mr. Bahri said. 
 In addition to the threat of these younger militants, there is the broader question of whether Mr. Bahri and his friends are involved in terrorism outside of Yemen. Mr. Bahri still supports the goals of Al Qaeda, and he speaks admiringly of Yemenis who fought in Iraq. 
 Yemeni officials say they have stepped up efforts to prevent Yemeni men from traveling for jihad. But Mr. Bahri says he knows 10 or 15 men who fought in Iraq, including two who went through Judge Hetar's program. 
 Asked what he did to advance the cause of Al Qaeda outside of Yemen, Mr. Bahri smiled, and said answering the question could be dangerous -- but that not answering it could also expose him to risks, from a different group of people. After a pause, he said he merely prayed for Al Qaeda's success. 
 Another veteran of the Afghan jihad, Ali Muhammad al-Kurdi, said in open court during the course of an unrelated terrorism trial in 2005 that he had trained two Yemeni men to fight in Iraq. He was never prosecuted for the claim, because it is not against Yemeni law. 
 ''They went to Iraq and fought, and they were killed there,'' said Mr. Kurdi, a soft-spoken 33-year-old, smiling at the thought, as he sat for an interview in a cafe in Old Sana.

HEADLINE: Real Estate Troubles Are Weighing on Florida Voters' Minds as Primary Nears

BYLINE: By KIRK SEMPLE

DATELINE: ST. CLOUD, Fla. 

 BODY:
Florida is a cultural patchwork. The Panhandle seems to have more in common with neighboring Alabama and Georgia than with Fort Lauderdale and Miami in the eclectic southern reaches of the state. The condo canyons on the coasts are worlds away from the sugar cane and orange plantations in the interior. 
 But as the state prepares for its presidential primary on Tuesday, one issue appears to sew together its disparate parts: the real estate crisis. 
 Florida has felt the effects of the national mortgage troubles and housing slowdown as acutely as anywhere in the country. Rampant construction has come to a halt, home sales have plummeted and job losses in housing-related industries have soared. At the same time, residents have seen a rise in property taxes and, after devastating hurricanes in 2004 and 2005, an increase in insurance rates. 
 Interviews with about two dozen people in this fast-growing Central Florida city found that of all the issues confronting the state, none was as important to most voters as the real estate crisis. Almost all said that slumping property values and rising taxes and insurance costs were at the top of their concerns. 
 ''It's very hard to operate a business in this time,'' said Mohamed Yusaf, 53, a native of Guyana who moved his family to St. Cloud from the Bronx in 1995 and now owns a small strip mall here and a motel in Kissimmee. ''After the hurricanes went by, everything went sky high -- property taxes, insurance.''
 Mr. Yusaf said the taxes and insurance on his hotel were about $24,000 per year combined, more than double the rates in 2004. 
 Almost all of those interviewed said they were undecided about how they would vote on Tuesday and seemed unsure what the candidates were proposing to address the real estate troubles.
 Candidates from both parties have been talking increasingly about the need for economic stimulus to avoid a recession, and some have proposed plans to stem the tide of foreclosures. 
 Rudolph W. Giuliani, who has tied the future of his campaign to results in Florida, has tried to differentiate himself from the other Republican candidates by promoting his support for a national catastrophic relief fund that would help lower the cost of hurricane insurance. 
 Apart from that fund, however, there was no mention of Florida's real estate crisis during the two-hour Republican debate Thursday in Boca Raton. (Democrats can vote on Tuesday, but the leading candidates for the party's nomination have not campaigned in Florida. And the national party stripped the state of its delegates, as punishment for holding its primary before Feb. 5.)
 For many Floridians, real estate has vaulted over other perennial concerns like public safety, immigration and health care. From the time the first speculators and hucksters arrived a century ago and began peddling swaths of swampland to dreamy-eyed northerners, property development has been a driving force of the state's growth. 
 Thus, as real estate goes, so goes Florida's collective psyche. 
 Last year, in response to rising anger about the cost of owning a home, the Florida Legislature approved a plan to lessen property taxes that includes a proposed constitutional amendment. The amendment will appear on the ballot Tuesday. 
 The measure, championed by Gov. Charlie Crist, a Republican, would limit property taxes while providing cuts for most homeowners. Florida does not have an income tax, and many local governments are lobbying against the amendment, saying it would ravage their budgets.
 State officials have also seized on the outcry over soaring insurance rates. State regulators and legislators have begun an inquiry into why rates have not declined in spite of a law passed last year intended to lower premiums. 
 Florida's real estate problems come into sharp focus here in St. Cloud and along the Interstate 4 corridor, which runs from Tampa on the Gulf Coast side, through Orlando in the center, to Daytona Beach on the Atlantic. 
 The area has traditionally had a high concentration of undecided voters, making it Florida's swing region in elections. Indeed, many of the voters interviewed in St. Cloud said they were considering candidates from both parties. 
 ''I'm a registered Republican,'' said Richard McConahay, 63, the former owner of a feed store here. ''But when it comes to that final minute in the booth, that doesn't really matter.''
 Mr. McConahay said he was leaning toward Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona. ''I think he's relatively sincere, relatively honest,'' he said.
 As for the main contenders for the Democratic nomination, Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York and Barack Obama of Illinois, ''I just don't get a good gut feeling from Hillary,'' Mr. McConahay said. ''I don't know Obama.'' 
 Mr. Yusaf, the motel owner, said he was a registered Democrat and planned to vote according to party affiliation, but he was trying to decide between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama. Though the real estate crisis was at the top of his concerns, he was evaluating the candidates on other issues, too, including health care. 
 Once a sleepy town of ranchers and retirees, St. Cloud has been transformed in recent years, with its population nearly tripling since 1990, to 30,100, and dozens of housing subdivisions springing up. But as in the rest of the state, construction has slowed and the real estate market has calcified. There are for-sale signs on nearly every block, and some newly built subdivisions sit half empty.
 John Groenendaal, a city planner for St. Cloud, said he paid $170,000 in 2004 for a 2,000-square-foot, three-bedroom house in the city. At the peak of the housing boom, in 2006, it was worth about $300,000, Mr. Groenendaal said. ''But if I had to sell it now,'' he said, ''I probably would only get $200,000.''
 Chris Heck, 47, a house framer living here, spoke of the building boom that buoyed this community and the rest of the state as if it were a distant memory.
 Mr. Heck said he once was overwhelmed with work but now has to take minor jobs to stay afloat. ''I can go over a month without anything to do,'' he said. 
 But as central as the real estate troubles are to his life, Mr. Heck said he was choosing his candidate based on a range of issues, including immigration. He said he was leaning toward Mr. Giuliani, a former New York mayor, and Mitt Romney, a former Republican governor of Massachusetts, and was particularly impressed by Mr. Romney's stance against illegal immigrants.
 Any conversation about the real estate crisis inevitably turns into a conversation about quality of life, and residents here say St. Cloud, and Florida in general, are not what they used to be. The laid-back life that people were seeking when they moved to the region is quickly disappearing, residents said. 
 Gary Simmons, 52, a mechanic for the safari trucks at Disney's Animal Kingdom, said he moved from Massachusetts in 1976, when St. Cloud and Kissimmee were what he called ''quiet.'' 
 ''People got along with each other,'' Mr. Simmons said. ''It's just got ridiculous. It's getting like Boston, I'm sorry to say it.'' 
 Several St. Cloud residents said they were looking to leave the state but were caught in a bind: They cannot move until they sell their property, yet the market has come to a standstill, and nobody is buying.
 Mr. Simmons has considered relocating to Georgia. ''People are so nice up there,'' he said.

 Global Appetite 
 For Innovation
 In its quest for what it calls ''new metrics for the knowledge economy,'' a nonprofit research group has come up with an index of global innovation confidence. 
 The poll of 25,000 people in a dozen nations, published on Tuesday, found the United States squarely in the middle of the pack. America trailed the nations that most enthusiastic about new technology, gadgets and services, a group that included the United Arab Emirates, India, Brazil, Ireland and China. Still, the United States came out ahead of the Europeans; the least thrilled by technology were the Netherlands, Finland, Slovenia and Turkey.
 Jonathan Levie, author of the study and a senior lecturer at the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow, noted that the nations most confident about innovation tended to be fast-growing economies with young populations. Innovation confidence, he said, doesn't closely track consumer confidence, as one might expect. So it is a separate sentiment.
 But innovation confidence, Mr. Levie said, does show a strong correlation with age worldwide. ''We find that innovation confidence starts dropping after people reach 40,'' he said.
 A sign of wisdom or technological exhaustion? Further research, it seems, is required.
 That is precisely what the Institute for Innovation and Information Productivity, the group that sponsored the index, has in mind. The group plans to conduct the innovation confidence studies annually as part of its broader research agenda as it seeks to measure what works and what doesn't in the knowledge economy -- as opposed to the industrial economy.

To the Editor:
 To have a meaningful debate over public policy you need to have real arguments, not fear-mongering. 
 In ''Debt Relief Made Harder for Homeowners'' (Business Day, Jan. 12), Steve Bartlett, president and chief executive of Financial Services Roundtable, an association in Washington representing the nation's largest lenders and securities dealers, claimed that legislation that allows a bankruptcy judge to adjust the interest rate and valuation of primary residences would ''drive up rates on new mortgages for everyone else and further disrupt the global securities market.''
 There may be a legitimate reason why the country's biggest banking institutions would oppose this legislation. but those reasons are not it. There is no data that supports the contention that bankruptcy changes being contemplated in Congress would do either. 
 The legislation that could help contain the current mortgage mess and help over 600,000 homeowners avoid foreclosure applies to existing loans only. Therefore, by definition, it could not affect future interest rates because it would not apply to future loans.
 Let's focus on stopping foreclosures, helping keep people in their homes and protecting our economy with a debate based on solid public policy and legitimate reasoning. 
 Jack Kemp Washington, Jan. 16, 2008
 The writer is the former secretary of housing and urban development.

HEADLINE: Looking for Eyeballs Suddenly on a Budget Is It a Recession? Marketers Seem to Think So

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
Let the economists and politicians debate whether the American economy is in a recession. Madison Avenue is already battening down the hatches. 
 Since September, Wal-Mart Stores, the nation's largest retailer, has built its entire current advertising approach upon this bald premise: ''Save money. Live better.'' Skeptics wondered at the time whether Wal-Mart and its new agency, the Martin Agency in Richmond, Va., part of the Interpublic Group of Companies, were fixating on price at the expense of other attractions like fashion or breadth of merchandise. 
 But the economic problems that followed -- falling prices for houses, tightening credit and the gyrations of the stock market -- vindicated their decision. Amid widespread consumer anxiety, Wal-Mart weathered a difficult holiday season for retailers, reporting a 2.7 percent increase for December while many of its rivals, including Target, posted losses. 
 ''We don't profess to have any prophetic abilities to call the economy any better than the folks who do it for a living,'' said Stephen Quinn, Wal-Mart's chief marketing officer. Rather, ''when gas prices spiked last spring,'' he added, ''we saw the pressure this put on our core customers.'' 
 Those customers can find plenty of companies following Wal-Mart's lead, with many campaigns speaking to Americans as if a recession were already under way. 
 But while many marketers may be looking to adjust the contents of their campaigns, forecasters believe overall advertising spending will remain strong as a recession looms.
 TNS Media Intelligence in New York estimates that ad spending will increase by 4.2 percent (fueled in part by an estimated $5 billion in spending connected to the Summer Olympics and the elections), a steep increase over a 1.7 percent increase a year earlier. 
 ''A large chunk of the core ad economy is in a weakened condition,'' said Jon Swallen, senior vice president for research at TNS. He cited retailers, especially ''housing-related retail, from the big-box chains to the mom-and-pop home furnishings stores.'' On the other hand, in ''key categories like automotive,'' he added, ''ad budgets have been going up as sales have been going down.'' 
 Here are some other campaigns suggesting that advertisers already believe the wolf is at the door:
 A campaign for Sammies, a new sandwich line at Quiznos, stresses the low price ($2 each) as much as the low calorie count (200 to 300 each).
 ''Uncertain times call for a very certain rate,'' assert advertisements for North Fork Bank, part of Capital One, offering a seven-month certificate of deposit at 4.25 percent.
 TheLadders.com, a jobs Web site, sent e-mail messages last Monday bearing this subject line: ''Recession is coming, get your job insurance now!''
 Nissan is pitching the fuel economy of its 2008 Altima sedan, rather than style or performance, with commercials devoted to its ability to go more than 600 miles between fill-ups.
 Ads from a new campaign for Club Med family resorts carry banner headlines declaring that ''Kids stay free.''
 Starbucks is testing in Seattle-area stores ''short,'' or small, coffees priced at $1 a cup -- and free refills.
 Sovereign Bank is wooing consumers to open checking accounts with up to $100 in ''gas reward cards.''
 Those with long memories may recall other times in the last two decades that ads were devoted to encouraging consumer frugality rather than celebrating unchecked spending. For example, there were price-conscious campaigns after the 1987 stock market crash, during the 1990-1 recession and after the dot-com bubble burst in 2000-1.
 This time, however, it seems the shift in tone is taking place earlier in the economic cycle. After all, a recession is defined traditionally as two straight quarters of contraction -- and officially, there has not even been one.
 ''California is in a tough economy right now,'' said Michael Branigan, vice president for marketing at Sizzler USA Restaurants in Culver City, Calif., which has restaurants in that state and 15 others as well as Puerto Rico.
 ''It's not that our consumer doesn't like us,'' he added. ''It's just that they don't have the money to eat out.''
 So Sizzler is starting a campaign from its new agency, Ground Zero in Los Angeles, featuring menu items that are priced between the fare at fast-food restaurants like McDonald's and casual-dining chains like Chili's.
 To signal what Mr. Branigan called the Sizzler ''value equation,'' a promotion last week offered an eight-ounce steak for a penny to customers who bought one at regular price. Ground Zero promoted the sale with offbeat video clips on Web sites like MySpace and YouTube.
 The willingness of Madison Avenue to act as if a recession is under way may seem confusing, because advertisers usually reduce their spending during downturns. Over all, ad outlays have fallen in previous recessions -- 6.5 percent in 2001 compared with 2000 and 1.2 percent in 1991 compared with 1990. 
 However, many marketers spend the same -- or even more -- during hard times as they do during booms, on the theory that they must make sure to be remembered by any consumers who are still shopping. And advertisers in competitive categories like automobiles, beer or fast food are reluctant to cut spending if their rivals are not. 
 Quiznos, whose chief rival is Subway, introduced Sammies, a line of flatbread sandwiches, in November. The $2 price is less than half the average Quiznos check, which runs ''significantly above $5,'' according to Steve Provost, chief marketing officer at Quiznos in Denver.
 ''Like all retailers, we're now staring down the barrel of consumer spending actually declining,'' he said. ''We want to hold on to quality, but at a price point that appeals to a much broader target.''
 The Sammies line already accounts for about 15 percent of Quiznos sales, Mr. Provost said. A campaign under way from Cliff Freeman & Partners in New York, part of MDC Partners, carries the theme ''Love what you eat'' and features a Sammies meal -- two sandwiches, a side dish and a fountain drink -- for $5.99. 
 ''It has attracted a new customer, more value conscious,'' he added, ''also more women, and guys looking for a lighter lunch.''
 ''Even marketers that usually aim products at consumers with more money in their wallets than Sizzler customers are playing ''Let's Make a Deal.''
 For instance, the new campaign for the upmarket Club Med resorts stresses the company's ''all inclusive'' pricing policy with phrases like ''Everything is taken care of.''
 ''What we are selling is good value for money,'' said Henri Giscard d'Estaing, chairman, president and chief executive at Club Mediterranee in Paris, ''especially for families.''
 ''It's extremely appropriate for the times,'' he added.
 The English-language version of the campaign, by the Publicis et Nous agency in Paris, part of the Publicis Groupe, carries the theme ''Where happiness means the world.''
 In French, the theme is ''Tous les bonheurs du monde,'' which Mr. Giscard d'Estaing translated as, ''All the small moments of happiness in the world.''
 Over all, Club Med will spend about as much in 2008 as it did in 2007, but plans to change the media mix significantly by adding more online advertising and reducing what it spends for television commercials. Some analysts believe that the ability to more closely monitor the results from Internet campaigns may keep demand for online ads high, regardless of economic conditions.

HEADLINE: A French Style Of Capitalism Is Now Stained

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ and JAD MOUAWAD; Nelson D. Schwartz reported from Paris, and Jad Mouawad from New York.

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
In a country where the hurly-burly of market capitalism has long been viewed with suspicion, Societe Generale was a rare Gallic success story -- the Chanel or Chateau Margaux of French banking. 
 The bank pioneered some of the most complex instruments in international finance, earning billions of dollars and the grudging respect of its American and British rivals. 
 So it was a shock to their national pride when top executives of Societe Generale found themselves on the seventh floor of the company's ultramodern headquarters a week ago Saturday interrogating a 31-year-old trader named Jerome Kerviel, and discovered just what their innovations had wrought. 
 Mr. Kerviel acknowledged placing more than $70 billion in secret, unauthorized derivatives trades, according to Societe Generale, saddling the bank with a $7.2 billion loss, the biggest ever caused by a rogue trader. 
 Now the bank, and the broader world of French business, finds itself shamed in the very arena where it had taken pride in being one step ahead of its Anglo-Saxon rivals that dominate financial niches like investment banking and securities underwriting.
 Even worse, Mr. Kerviel took advantage of the very technological sophistication French banks are known for to hide his tracks. 
 ''I have to admit this event is a massive shock for us,'' said Jean-Pierre Mustier, who as a 26-year-old helped midwife equity derivatives trading at Societe Generale in 1987 and is now one of the bank's top executives as head of the corporate and investment banking division. ''I was speaking to a competitor, this competitor called me and said, 'You are living what is a banker's worst nightmare.' '' 
 Indeed, the debacle has so embarrassed Societe Generale that Mr. Mustier and other top executives of the bank may not survive in their jobs. 
 It was only last May that Christian Noyer, the governor of the Banque de France, the nation's central bank, promoted the country's competitive edge in equity derivatives, an arcane universe that allows investors to take risky bets on future movements of stocks or markets. With a 25 percent global market share, Mr. Noyer boasted at a banking conference in Mumbai, ''French expertise in this field is founded on a solid teaching in math and finance, the key to excellency in financial fields, and on an important hive of university-level talents.'' 
 Now, critics at home have been quick to seize on the many paradoxes implicit in a tale that has riveted France and the rest of Europe, especially because Societe Generale has been associated with the creme de la creme of the French banking world since its founding by Napoleon III in 1864.
 What is more, the scandal is likely to confirm the suspicions of ordinary French citizens, who in recent days have echoed the famous observation attributed to Honore de Balzac that ''Behind every great fortune there is a crime.''
 Facing persistent questions about how the trading could have gone undetected, the bank acknowledged Sunday that Mr. Kerviel's activities prompted inquiries from risk managers several times last year, but that the bank never began an investigation because it accepted Mr. Kerviel's explanations.
 ''Societe Generale is a pioneer, so it is not surprising that the most creative fraud would take place within the bank's most creative activity,'' said Elie Cohen, a French economist and researcher at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique. ''You don't have big frauds like this in routine banking activities. Accidents happen in the borderline businesses.''
 Within the ranks of Societe Generale, what makes the activities of Mr. Kerviel even more humiliating is that he was able to cover them up for so long, without tripping the vaunted risk-control systems that Societe Generale has long been known for.
 Melody Jeannin, a spokeswoman for the Societe Generale, insisted that the bank moved quickly to stop the fraudulent trades after they were detected and devised a solution in just three days. ''We took immediate measures to strengthen the internal risk controls, and proposed a solution to restore balance sheet strength and reassure investors,'' she said.
 Mr. Mustier, a native of Clermont-Ferrand in the Auvergne region of France, has become the bank's point man on the scandal, shepherding reporters through the details of Mr. Kerviel's trades while frequently conferring with his boss, Daniel Bouton, the bank's chief executive.
 And as a former student at two of France's most elite engineering schools -- the Ecole Polytechnique and the Ecole des Mines -- Mr. Mustier, 47, exhibits the cool, disciplined style that alumni of those institutions are known for. 
 When asked what his personal reaction was to the rogue trades, he said, ''It was not the time for personal feelings, but for actions.''
 Although the local cemetery that abuts Societe Generale's mirrored headquarters on the outskirts of Paris might give more superstitious employees pause, the bank's traders have long been known for the cockiness that comes with high salaries and pedigrees from France's best engineering schools. (In fact, Mr. Kerviel's salary of roughly 100,000 euros, or $147,000, would have put him at the low end of the bank's pay scale for traders.)
 And Societe Generale traditionally has shown more boldness than other, more conservative giants of French industry. When French banks were privatized in the 1980s, Societe Generale was the first to emerge from government control, starting in July 1987. Mr. Mustier's innovative derivatives trade on the Paris Bourse, in fact, took place just two months afterward, in September 1987.
 Mr. Mustier was recruited to the bank by Antoine Paille, a fellow whiz kid who graduated from the Ecole Nationale de la Statistique et de l'Administation Economique, before starting the bank's derivatives desk in the mid-1980s. 
 With French banks still sleepy after decades of state control and far behind their more aggressive foreign counterparts in global capital markets, the two men set out to make Societe Generale a world leader in the emerging field of derivatives.
 And by hiring young mathematicians and quantitative analysts, or quants, from the Grandes Ecoles, the country's prestigious and highly elitist state schools, to help them create complex formulas that are the bedrock of the trade, they managed to do that.
 From just 25 people in 1990, the equity derivatives division at the bank now employs 3,500 people. (Mr. Paille has since left the bank and is a derivatives executive at Commerzbank of Germany.) 
 In 2006, Societe Generale earned 5.2 billion euros in net income. Its corporate and investment unit contributed 2.3 billion euros to the bank's profit. 
 Profit in the field pioneered by Societe Generale mounted as swiftly as one of the graphs in of their elegant mathematical models. Over all, the bank's derivatives unit accounts for an estimated 20 percent of the bank's total profit, according to various estimates by analysts. 
 And until the fraudulent trades, the company's shares had outperformed those of its European peers, including bigger rivals like Deutsche Bank and BNP Paribas, for six of the last eight years.
 According to a Merrill Lynch report from December, Societe Generale expected a 10 percent growth in its equity derivatives business this year thanks to retail customers and emerging markets growth. What is more, because it relies so much on computer programs and systems, rather than on manpower, the business is highly profitable.
 Mr. Mustier and Mr. Bouton will be spending the coming days answering questions about how Mr. Kerviel could possibly have wagered more than $70 billion without being detected -- and whether he had indeed acted alone, as they both insist. But broader questions are likely to be asked about the safety of the derivatives business and whether French banks have placed too many of their bets on it.
 ''What used to be an excellent management team sitting on an enviable retail franchise and a global leadership position in derivatives is now a management under pressure suffering from a lack of confidence,'' the Merrill Lynch analysts Antonio Guglielmi and Alberto Segafredo said in a recent report. 
 Criticism like that, along with additional losses from bad investments in American subprime-mortgage debt, has spurred talk that Societe Generale might be forced to merge with another bank, possibly BNP Paribas, its archrival and France's largest bank by revenue.
 But with questions continuing to mount even as the exact trail of Mr. Kerviel's trades is still being analyzed, a more immediate threat is that Societe Generale and other French banks will lose the edge in derivatives trading they worked so hard to establish over the last two decades. 
 ''Societe Generale was a superb bank that has done some great things but it is now hard to see how it will get through this on its own,'' Mr. Cohen said. ''But what is worrying here is that other banks are not in a much better state. French banks are in the same boat as everyone else here.''

CORRECTION-DATE: January 29, 2008

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Monday about the failure of the French bank Societe Generale to investigate the actions of a junior trader that eventually cost the bank more than $7 billion misstated, in some copies, the volume of trades placed by the employee. It was $70 billion, not $750 billion.

HEADLINE: Sallie Mae Settles Suit Over Buyout That Fizzled

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN and MICHAEL J. de la MERCED

 BODY:
Sallie Mae, the embattled student lending giant, reached a settlement on Sunday over its scuttled $25 billion buyout, ending months of legal fighting that had cast a cloud over the company, according to people briefed on the agreement.
 The company, formally known as the SLM Corporation, agreed to settle with its onetime buyers, which include the private equity firm J. C. Flowers & Company, JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, in exchange for a deal to refinance about $30 billion in debt that was due next month. 
 Both Sallie Mae's lawsuit and the buyers' counterclaims will be dismissed, and the merger agreement has been terminated, these people said. A trial in Delaware Chancery Court had been scheduled for December of this year. 
 A spokesman for Sallie Mae declined to comment, as did a spokeswoman for the buyers' consortium.
 The announcement concludes one of the bitterest legal fights to emerge from the end of the buyout boom. After a two-year feast in which private equity firms gobbled ever-larger targets, a handful of deals have collapsed, but few disputes became as heated as that between Sallie Mae and its buyers, whose $60-a-share deal collapsed shortly after its announcement last April.
 Securing the $30 billion credit line solves one of Sallie Mae's biggest problems and will very likely serve as a vote of confidence on the company's prospects. Since the near shutdown of the credit markets last summer, the company has been unable to issue new debt that is backed by its student loans, depriving it of a huge source of capital. As a result, it drew down its credit line, which had been provided by JPMorgan and Bank of America as part of the buyout deal.
 The company also has suffered financially from the deteriorating economy. It reported a $1.6 billion loss for its fourth quarter after preparing for a jump in student loan defaults. It also took a hit from bad bets on its stock price, which it settled by issuing $3 billion in new capital.
 Sallie Mae's stock has plummeted more than 56 percent over the last year, and closed at $19.88 on Friday.
 A settlement will end a war of words between Sallie Mae and its former buyers over a $900 million breakup fee, which Sallie Mae sought after arguing that the consortium illegally scuttled the deal. The buyers claimed that new legislation to cut federal subsidies to student lenders had substantially harmed the company's financial health. By exercising an escape hatch in the deal agreement, known as a material adverse effect clause, the buyers tried to walk away without paying the $900 million fee. 
 Had the buyers been forced to pay, the brunt of the fee would have been borne by J. C. Flowers, a firm far smaller than its two bank partners.
 Relations between the two sides had become so toxic since last summer that they refused to talk to each other for months, a situation that only worsened as Sallie Mae's chief executive, Albert L. Lord, took a hard-line stance in negotiations. Under Mr. Lord's guidance, the company rejected a revised buyout offer that would have paid $50 a share and potentially more if the lender met or exceeded its financial targets.
 A thaw began earlier this month when the company appointed Anthony P. Terracciano, who turned around struggling financial firms like Dime Bancorp and First Fidelity Bancorp, as chairman, and John F. Remondi as chief financial officer. Mr. Remondi reached out two weeks ago to James B. Lee Jr., JPMorgan's vice chairman and senior rainmaker, people briefed on the matter said. Mr. Lee, who has already played the role of peacemaker in several challenged deals this year, led the consortium's efforts to reach an agreement, these people said, and brought Gregory L. Curl, a vice chairman at Bank of America, into the settlement discussions.
 JPMorgan and Sallie Mae have a long history; they ran a joint student loan venture for nearly 10 years, though it was dissolved in 2005.
 As recently as last Wednesday, when Sallie Mae held its annual shareholder meeting, Mr. Remondi said the company was ''very, very close'' to refinancing the credit line. At the time, he said that the company had been holding discussions with ''more than 10'' potential partners.
 JPMorgan and Bank of America will take the lead in offering the new financing, worth about $31 billion and good for 364 days. Others involved in the financing are Barclays Capital, Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse, the Royal Bank of Scotland and UBS, Sallie Mae's banker in the failed buyout. J. C. Flowers is expected to contribute tens of millions of dollars into the deal, the people knowledgeable about the settlement said, although they refused to provide exact figures.
 Sallie Mae is expected to pay an interest rate of about 4.5 percent.
 With its financing and buyout-related legal issues settled, Sallie Mae can now focus on its other pressing issues. Chief among those is stemming potential losses from student loan defaults. The $1.6 billion loss it reported last Wednesday included a $575 million loan-loss provision.

HEADLINE: Too Easy to Refuse

 BODY:
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice made Iran another offer it could refuse last week. Speaking in Davos, Ms. Rice said that the United States didn't want Iran as a ''permanent enemy'' and that better relations were possible if Tehran would give up its nuclear fuel program. 
 Iran has already rejected similar nebulous, highly conditional offers from the White House, and it seemed unimpressed this time. It is likely to have the same non-reaction to a third sanctions resolution now being considered by the United Nations Security Council. The proposal opens up a potentially significant new penalty by urging states to inspect cargo on Iranian ships and aircraft if they are suspected of transporting prohibited nuclear-related items. But it still lacks real economic bite. 
 We were surprised, and somewhat reassured, that America and Europe managed to get China and Russia to sign on to any resolution. All of the key players -- except the United States -- have strong economic reasons not to put the squeeze on Iran. And President Bush has made things a lot harder: raising the specter of World War III even as his intelligence community was reporting that Iran had abandoned its secret weapons program, if not its nuclear ambitions.
 So the fact that the major powers are still talking about even limited sanctions may surprise some in Tehran. But apparently even Moscow and Beijing have no doubts about the danger of Iran's overt nuclear efforts. The longer Iran defies the Security Council and continues to enrich uranium, the closer its scientists get to mastering the skills for building a weapon. Without stronger punishments and stronger incentives, Iran is unlikely to halt its efforts. 
 Even if the resolution is adopted, European, Asian and gulf states -- which all say they're fearful of Iran's nuclear appetites -- should make their own effort to tighten economic screws. They can start by ordering their banks to stop dealing with Iranian banks Melli and Saderat. America's crackdown on the banks last year has raised Iran's cost of doing international business. 
 Russia and the Arab states must also stop trying to have it both ways with Iran. Even as it threw its weight behind a new sanctions resolution, Russia delivered more fuel for Iran's nuclear power reactor at Bushehr. Saudi Arabia, which is as fearful as Washington about Tehran's nuclear ambitions, was host to Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, for the recent hajj pilgrimage. Last week another close American ally, Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak, had his first-ever chat on the phone about regional issues with the Iranian president. 
 As for incentives, that's Washington's department. Just talking about better relations is clearly not enough to get Tehran's attention. What is needed is a credible grand gesture, like sending a high-level envoy to Tehran with a concrete list of diplomatic and economic rewards, including a timetable for restoring full diplomatic relations with the United States -- if Tehran is ready to deal. 
 We can't guarantee that Mr. Ahmadinejad and the mullahs are interested. It would send a strong message to Iran's citizens about the folly of their leaders' course. It would give Mr. Bush the credibility to demand that the Russians, the Chinese, the Egyptians, the Saudis, and the list goes on, do more to stop enabling Tehran.

HEADLINE: The Bush Who Got Away

BYLINE: By JACOB WEISBERG. 
Jacob Weisberg, the editor of Slate, is the author of ''The Bush Tragedy.''

 BODY:
AS George W. Bush prepares to deliver his final State of the Union address, it's worth revisiting the first speech he gave to a joint session of Congress. His valedictory words tonight will provide an opportunity to reflect on the kind of president Mr. Bush was. The speech delivered seven years ago points to the very different sort of president he might have been. 
 Mr. Bush began his February 2001 address by hailing the new spirit of cooperation he hoped would characterize his relations with Congress. ''Together we are changing the tone in the nation's capital,'' he declared. The new president's top priority would be education. He intended to marry the liberal desire for more federal money to the conservative demand for higher standards. 
 The rest of the speech was similarly moderate in tone and substance. Mr. Bush planned to use part of the enormous fiscal surplus he inherited for a broad-based tax cut. But he also wanted to expand Medicare benefits, preserve Social Security, extend access to health care and protect the environment. He concluded with an exhortation to bipartisanship -- in Spanish. ''Juntos podemos,'' he said. ''Together we can.'' 
 Mr. Bush seemed genuinely to want to be the kind of president indicated by that first address. He meant to build a broad coalition on the model of his governorship in Texas, where he worked closely with Democrats in the Legislature, made his chief cause correcting racial disparities in education, and was re-elected in 1998 by an almost 40 percentage point margin, including 27 percent of the black vote and at least a third of Latinos. I always sort of liked that George W. Bush. Whatever happened to him? 
 Mr. Bush never completely abandoned the compassionate conservatism we glimpsed that night seven years ago. His second speech to Congress, nine days after Sept. 11, 2001, reflected his instinctive response to the attacks, which was to appeal for national unity in a non-partisan manner. Mr. Bush's third speech to Congress (his first formal State of the Union address, in 2002) is remembered for its reference to the ''axis of evil.'' But the president also boasted about his cooperation with such Democrats as George Miller and Ted Kennedy on education policy. His strongest emphasis was on public service. He proposed doubling the size of the Peace Corps and called on every American to commit at least 4,000 hours -- two full working years -- to community service. 
 The following year, in 2003, Mr. Bush pressed his case for invading Iraq and uttered the infamous 16 words (''The British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa''). But alongside that disingenuous indictment, Mr. Bush presented Congress with a new raft of centrist-minded initiatives: $450 million to minister to the needs of children of prisoners, $600 million to treat drug addicts, $1.2 billion for hydrogen-powered cars, $10 billion in new money to fight AIDS in Africa and the Caribbean. 
 And so on, in each subsequent speech. In 2004, Mr. Bush used weasel words to describe the missing Iraqi weapons of mass destruction. He claimed to have disrupted ''dozens of weapons of mass destruction-related program activities.'' But when he turned to domestic matters, the president unveiled a new science and math program for low-income students and a program to help former prisoners re-enter society. He included an eloquent plea for the kind of immigration reform that would ''reflect our values and benefit our economy.'' 
 To this day, Mr. Bush's compassionate conservatism has never vanished completely. Some of Mr. Bush's signature programs, like his initiative to provide AIDS drugs to Africans, have had meaningful effects. But others haven't lived up to their rhetorical promise. What about that special training for defense lawyers in capital cases (pledged in his 2005 State of the Union address)? The initiative to encourage mentoring for at-risk children (2006)? The grants to extend health insurance coverage (2007)? Such gestures tended to linger in the air only as long as it took Mr. Bush to make them. 
 So often with Mr. Bush, compassionate government began and ended with the heartfelt public avowal. He was too distracted by war and foreign policy, and too bored by the processes of government to know if the people working for him were following through on his proposals. 
 And of course, Mr. Bush's left hand acted as if it didn't know what his right hand was doing. After his first year in office, Democrats burned by his political strategy of polarization were disinclined to work with him on shared goals. 
 The Compassionate Conservative will surely pay us a final visit tonight. He remains an appealing character, but a largely fictional one. I wonder how the last seven years might have turned out if he had actually existed. In the final year of a failed presidency, I bet Mr. Bush does too.

HEADLINE: Paulson's Deal-Making Revives Treasury's Relevance

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS and DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
In his first two years as Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr. spent much of his time learning what his can-do pragmatism could not do.
 Mr. Paulson, a former chairman of Goldman Sachs, tried in vain to build bridges between Republicans and Democrats about reforming Social Security and Medicare. 
 He started a ''strategic economic dialogue'' with China, but made little progress in persuading China to let its currency rise. He called for an overhaul of corporate tax rates, but made no headway in Congress.
 But now Mr. Paulson is on a roll, owing to circumstances that had not exactly been on his agenda: an economic crisis stemming from the historic bust in housing prices and bad mortgages. 
 Ever since August, Mr. Paulson has been on a whirlwind of initiatives, some successful and some not, which culminated last week in a $150 billion fiscal stimulus package that he negotiated in record time with House Democrats.
 The fiscal deal could still collapse because Senate Democrats plan to reopen demands for measures that Republicans oppose. But with a recession looming and elections just nine months away, both parties have ample incentives to deliver tangible relief quickly.
 ''I don't place a lot of value on ideology for ideology's sake,'' Mr. Paulson said in an interview in his office last Friday. ''I am looking to do something that makes a difference.''
 That is a big change for the Bush administration, which had seemed to relish battles and disdain compromise over spending bills and the war in Iraq even after Democrats won majorities in both the House and Senate 15 months ago.
 Mr. Paulson's pivotal role also signals a striking revival of the Treasury Department. Over the first six years of Mr. Bush's presidency, the Treasury had withered into little more than a marketing arm for economic policies that were conceived by a handful of people at the White House.
 John W. Snow, who preceded Mr. Paulson as Treasury secretary, had traveled relentlessly to sell Mr. Bush's tax cuts, along with his ill-fated attempt to overhaul Social Security.
 Mr. Paulson, by contrast, has projected a clear lack of interest in party politics. He publicly refused to make campaign speeches for Republican candidates in the 2006 midterm elections.
 ''He has a bias for action,'' said Robert K. Steel, under secretary of the Treasury for domestic finance, who worked with Mr. Paulson on Wall Street for years. ''You start by looking at what people want to accomplish, look for where there is agreement and then work toward that.''
 Mr. Paulson's defining moment in the negotiations over a fiscal stimulus plan, according to lawmakers and some administration officials, came immediately after a conference call on Jan. 17 that included Mr. Bush, Mr. Paulson and Republican and Democratic leaders from the House and Senate.
 Mr. Bush, according to several participants, aggravated some of the Democrats by saying he would announce his own proposal for a $150 billion plan the next day.
 After the call, Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada and the majority leader, was still angry and complained publicly that Mr. Bush seemed to be acting in a ''unilateral'' rather than a ''bipartisan'' way. But even as that was happening, Mr. Paulson was calling back the lawmakers one by one to smooth over the bruised feelings. And he followed up by urging Mr. Bush to speak only about general principles and leave the specifics for lawmakers to hash out.
 Mr. Bush did indeed hold back specifics, and Democrats refrained from publicly attacking specific measures that they knew Mr. Bush wanted to enact that they strongly opposed.
 Last Wednesday, Mr. Paulson hammered out a deal after three long private sessions with Representative Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California and the House speaker, and the House Republican leader, John Boehner of Ohio. Starting over a breakfast of bagels and fruit, and finishing with a meeting that ended at about 8:30 p.m., the three negotiators were joined by fewer than 10 top aides in all. 
 Mr. Paulson, according to one participant, left most of the talking to Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Boehner and focused instead on keeping them on track toward an agreement. But because Mr. Paulson had already held scores of phone calls with both lawmakers, and many others, the three already had a sense of both their bottom-line demands and the points they might concede.
 ''I had a good rapport with him,'' Ms. Pelosi said in an interview. ''He knew we had to have an arrangement, so if I was going to give anything up, I had to get a lot.''
 Democrats were relieved that Mr. Bush did not insist that a stimulus plan include a permanent extension of his tax cuts, a move that Democrats would have blocked potentially delaying the entire effort.
 Mr. Bush had repeatedly emphasized that making the tax cuts permanent was one of his top economic priorities. White House officials say Mr. Bush had no intention of linking the stimulus bill to his tax cuts, but they did not confirm that publicly until the evening before Mr. Bush's speech on Jan. 18.
 The result was a bargain that both sides could call a victory. Mr. Bush and House Republican leaders agreed to provide tax rebates to almost everybody, including millions of people who did not earn enough to pay federal income taxes. Ms. Pelosi agreed to drop demands to expand unemployment benefits and food stamps.
 Unlike many other top Bush administration officials, Mr. Paulson has taken pains to cast himself as a bridge-builder to Democrats.
 Immediately after being confirmed as Treasury secretary, he reached out to prominent Democrats. He sounded out Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, about ways to reduce the looming budget shortfalls in Social Security.
 Somewhat naively, he suggested that he was open to all options, implicitly including tax increases, only to be reined in by Karl Rove, then Mr. Bush's top political adviser.
 But in recent months, Mr. Paulson has actively sought out the views of top Democrats as he considered ways to address a rising panic about foreclosures by subprime mortgage borrowers and rising fears about an economic recession.
 When Mr. Bush traveled to the Middle East 10 days ago, Mr. Paulson canvassed both Democrats and Republicans about what they might or might not accept in a fiscal stimulus package.
 The answers were straightforward. Democrats wanted a mix of tax rebates and spending aimed primarily at middle- and low-income people who were most likely to be in financial trouble. Republican lawmakers abhorred any new spending on unemployment benefits or food stamps, opposed tax rebates for people who had not owed any taxes and wanted tax incentives for business.
 Even Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts and the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, who is often a biting critic of the Bush administration, praised Mr. Paulson for his willingness to listen as well as his ear for the political concerns of lawmakers.
 ''We have had good conversations with Paulson,'' Mr. Frank said in an interview shortly before the stimulus deal was announced. ''And I am prepared to go out on a limb by the way and say that being in the financial services industry is better preparation to be secretary of the Treasury than either aluminum or railroads, which were the two predecessors.''
 Mr. Paulson has not stopped buttonholing or demon-dialing lawmakers. On Friday, when most lawmakers had gone back to their home states for the weekend, he met personally with Senator Chris Dodd of Connecticut, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, and called at least 10 other lawmakers including Mr. Reid and Senator Max Baucus of Montana, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.
 The can-do man was leaving nothing to chance.

HEADLINE: Should Bankers Pay for Their Mismanagement?

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER

 BODY:
What is to be done with the bankers? From the savings and loan meltdown in the 1980s to the current housing-led seizure, financial institutions have proved unable to curb their appetite for risky assets -- blowing up the bank and spreading economic mayhem. 
 After every crisis, regulators say they will cure the financial system of the recent folly, reassuring the public that the caustic asset du jour -- Latin American debt, Internet stocks, mortgages in Florida -- will never again be allowed to bring the banks down. 
 Yet the recurrence of disasters suggests that the risky cravings of the masters of the universe are uncurbed. All that happens is that the next crisis takes a somewhat different form from the last, using some newly noxious financial product that used to be considered safe as, um, houses.
 It's not just that a rogue junior trader at a French bank can chalk up losses of more than $7 billion without anybody noticing. The subprime strategies that last year wiped out about $22 billion at Merrill Lynch, $20 billion at Citigroup and $9 billion at Morgan Stanley were devised and encouraged at the very top. 
 There's nothing like a smart banker motivated by an otherworldly bonus to get around the most carefully written regulatory limits on his or her ability to make money. Say regulators demand that banks maintain a big cushion of capital as a share of their loans, as a form of insurance in case the bets go bad. All a wily banker has to do is move the risky investment to a ''structured investment vehicle'' and claim it is not on the balance sheet. And there are other tricks.
 Bankers' recklessness would merely be a problem for shareholders to solve if banks lost only their shareholders' money. But banks, as we painfully relearn every few years, spread the damage widely. That's why the government not only explicitly guarantees bank deposits, but also offers implicit guarantees that banks will be bailed out in times of trouble.
 Regulation certainly needs tightening to mitigate the worst kind of irresponsible, often predatory lending that led to our current mess. But there is a part of the problem that regulators do not touch: bankers have an incentive to bet the bank every time around. That's because of how they are paid.
 In a good year, top bankers' pay would shame Croesus. But they don't have to return past bonuses when the year is bad. Merrill fired its chief, Stanley O'Neal, and Citigroup dispensed with Charles Prince. But Morgan Stanley's John Mack is hanging on. None have returned the untold millions they made in all those years when their banks were stuffing themselves with subprime loans.
 A better alignment of rewards with the long-term performance of the bank and its investments could reduce the incentive to maximize profit in the short run and shrug off the possibility that the bet sours just around the corner.
 One approach would be to pay a large share of all bankers' remuneration with restricted stock that vested over several years. To impose discipline on individual bankers, Raghuram Rajan, the former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, suggests that banks should hold a big chunk of bankers' pay in escrow to be paid out over a long period. Compensation could then be made contingent on the long-term success of each banker's strategies.
 Bankers who had to forfeit substantial portions of their pay if their investments turned bad down the road might discipline their craving for things like subprime mortgage-laced collateralized debt obligations, which provided extremely high returns until wobbles in the housing market turned them into virtually worthless pieces of paper.
 Remuneration is tricky terrain. Banks might resist reconfiguring bankers' pay out of fear that their top talent would jump ship. But regulators could encourage bankers to voluntarily rejigger their compensation schemes. Just as changes in the tax code in the 1990s prompted a surge in equity-based pay, other changes might encourage bankers to think about the long-term consequences of their actions.
 If banks do not want to address the problem, they risk Congressional action. For many members of Congress, regulating bankers' livelihoods to keep them from ruining everybody else's may seem like an attractive move.

HEADLINE: 'Great Idea.' 'Happy to Help.' Amity May Give Bush a Lift.

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
This week showcases an unusual role reversal: someplace else will look angrier and more dysfunctional than political Washington, at least for a moment.
 The bitter contests pitting Senator Barack Obama of Illinois and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York in Democratic presidential primaries and Senator John McCain of Arizona and Mitt Romney of Massachusetts in Republican contests suddenly make Pennsylvania Avenue appear an oasis of cooperation.
 That is largely because of the extraordinarily swift agreement between the White House and Congress over a $150 billion stimulus package intended to forestall an economic recession. 
 The package hasn't passed either chamber, and senators in both parties are grumbling. Yet when President Bush enters the House chamber Monday night to deliver his final State of the Union address, his accord with Speaker Nancy Pelosi will have softened the atmosphere. And that may even have consequences that last longer than just one night.
 Narrow Opening
 Mr. Bush's State of the Union address -- described by a senior administration official as less ''antagonistic'' than some past messages -- will reflect diminished domestic ambitions. That is not unusual for lame-duck presidents, who typically elevate foreign policy concerns in their final year, since by that point their clout on Capitol Hill has waned.
 But aides hope that the good feelings from cooperation on the economy may prove a modest prod to accords on some outstanding trade deals, as well as on re-authorization of the No Child Left Behind education law and terrorism surveillance.
 No one is expecting the public suddenly to sit up and applaud, given the depth of Americans' discontent with Washington -- and now with economic anxieties heaped on top of their desire to end the war. That is because, also typically, ''The penalty for not acting is much greater than the reward for acting,'' the senior administration official says.
 Walking Wounded?
 But Mr. Bush's political relevance extends beyond the fate of legislation.
 In recent months, Mr. Bush has helped stuff the coffers of the Republican National Committee, the one party organization with a cash edge over its Democratic counterpart. Since Mr. Bush remains popular with his party's conservative base, he can also help unite social, economic and national security conservatives behind the eventual nominee, despite their misgivings about the 2008 field.
 Yet unless he can do something to boost his meager low-30s approval ratings, Mr. Bush could prove a major drag in the fall on the Republican nominee, as well as on Congressional candidates, Republican strategists fear. Staving off recession -- or at least showing Americans that he is trying to -- could be the very something he needs.
 ''Anything they can do to get his numbers up is helpful to them,'' says Mark Mellman, a pollster who advises Democratic Congressional leaders.
 Democrats insist that the tone of Mr. Bush's closing chapter is up to him. ''If he wants to go out with confrontation, we can do that,'' says Representative Rahm Emanuel of Illinois, the leader of the House Democratic Conference, a prospect that is plain from the contentiousness of the last seven years. But ''if he wants to go out in a wave of cooperation, we can do that, too.''
 Mr. Emanuel remains confident that neither alternative will threaten the House Democrats' ability to hold their majority, now at 232 seats.
 In any event, no members in either party dare block the effort to send prompt rebate checks of $300 to $600 to taxpayers. Who ''would want to throw themselves in front of that train''? notes a Senate Republican leadership aide. 
 It won't likely be embattled Republican incumbents like Senator Norm Coleman of Minnesota, Senator John E. Sununu of New Hampshire and Senator Susan Collins of Maine, whose races are critical to their party's hopes of preventing Democrats from substantially augmenting their 51-seat majority.
 Presidential candidates have also treated the stimulus deal cautiously. While most have said it does not go far enough in one way or the other, Republicans aren't adopting the scorn of conservative analysts who condemn rebate checks as economically meaningless political gestures. Democrats aren't making too much noise about the absence of additional money for food stamps and unemployment benefits.
 For once, Washington bashing can look like a bad bet.

HEADLINE: For Gay Democrats, a Primary Where Rights Are Not an Issue, This Time

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS

 BODY:
The impromptu debate, over light beers and dirty martinis, was at once mundane and remarkable. Provoked by a reporter, four middle-aged men at a Greenwich Village gay bar made fiery pitches for the Democratic presidential front-runners. Two backed Senator Barack Obama, one argued for Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, and the fourth made an emotional plea for the cause of John Edwards, the former senator from North Carolina. 
 ''Edwards is the only one who really cares about the underdog,'' one of the men, Farid Martinez, 41, a clothing designer from Brooklyn, shouted above the din at the bar, the Monster, across from Sheridan Square. His friend Edmund Taylor, 37, disagreed, and nearly sputtered with rage: ''The guy is a millionaire lawyer obsessed with his hair. Obama is the only one who can really transform this country.'' 
 What was notable about the exchange last week was what was not mentioned: the word ''gay.'' 
 For the first time in two decades, gay voters find themselves in an unusual, if happy, predicament. The three leading Democrats have staked out similar positions on issues that resonate with gay men and lesbians. Although none of the three candidates back gay marriage, they all support same-sex civil unions and say they would fight to repeal the military's ''don't ask, don't tell'' policy. And each of them says he or she would champion a federal anti-discrimination law that would protect lesbians and gay men.
 ''You would need a magnifying glass to see any real or substantive differences between the three candidates,'' said Alan Van Capelle, the executive director of the Empire State Pride Agenda, a gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender civil rights group in New York.
 The Republican field is a different story. All of the candidates hold opposite positions from the Democrats on those matters, and although gay rights have not dominated the Republican contest so far, if past elections are any guide, they will become an issue after the primaries, political strategists say. 
 For the moment, however, gay voters in New York are looking past the issues that have long guided them toward a candidate. They are talking about the conflict in Iraq, universal health care and whether it is more important to have a president with experience or exuberance. 
 ''I think there's also a lot of excitement over having someone other than George Bush in the White House,'' said Matthew W. Carlin, president of the Stonewall Democratic Club, a gay political group that endorsed Senator Clinton in September. ''And there's a feeling that people could be happy with any of the Democrats.''
 In what many gay leaders described as a fairly momentous occasion, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Obama and Mr. Edwards showed up at a forum in August sponsored by the gay cable channel Logo and talked about the bravery of gay soldiers, adoption rights for same-sex couples and the problems faced by homeless gay teenagers. All three candidates employ gay strategists at the national and state levels, and in the two weeks leading up to the New York primary on Feb. 5, representatives from each campaign said, they planned to concentrate on the state's gay vote through mailings and rallies.
 ''We're going to get the word out best we can to show that Hillary has done more for the community than any other political figure in America,'' said Ethan Geto, a veteran Democratic consultant who is the Clinton campaign's senior policy adviser on gay and lesbian concerns. 
 Although an exact count is elusive, pollsters estimate that lesbians and gay men make up between 5 and 13 percent of the Democratic vote in New York; even if the lower figure is accepted, it is a voting bloc worth courting. Ken Sherrill, a political scientist at Hunter College who studies the gay electorate, said lesbians and gay men are far more likely to be interested in politics than are mainstream voters. ''This is a group of people whose lives are intimately affected by government policy,'' he said.
 With about a week left before the primary, the gay vote appears to be mirroring the statewide electorate, which is leaning toward Senator Clinton but has yet to coalesce around one candidate. As one of the state's most powerful politicians, Mrs. Clinton enjoys widespread institutional support in the gay community; most of the city's gay Democratic groups have endorsed her, as have the state's highest-ranking openly gay officials, including the speaker of the New York City Council, Christine C. Quinn, and State Senator Thomas K. Duane of Manhattan. Last week, The New York Blade, a local gay newspaper, endorsed Mrs. Clinton as well. 
 But the campaigns of Mr. Edwards and Mr. Obama have been eagerly courting -- and raising money from -- gay men and lesbians, and both have put together lists of prominent gay supporters. 
 ''Hillary has an advantage, but she certainly does not have a lock on the gay vote,'' said Matt Foreman, the executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, who has remained neutral. 
 The Democratic field stands in contrast to the Republican contenders. Mike Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor, has not repudiated his suggestion, made in 1992, that people with AIDS be isolated from the general population. He and the other leading candidates -- Senator John McCain of Arizona, former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York and Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor -- are opposed to same-sex civil unions and any compromise that would allow gays to serve openly in the military. 
 Still, compared with the last two presidential elections, when gay rights were a call to arms among conservatives and an issue to be avoided by Democrats, many political experts agreed that this year, gay-related themes had been overshadowed by the economy, the war in Iraq and illegal immigration. 
 Much seems to have changed since 1988, when the Democratic nominee, Michael S. Dukakis, turned down an offer of a gay fund-raising campaign. Four years later, gay delegates threatened to storm out of the Democratic convention unless Bill Clinton mentioned gays in his acceptance speech. (He did.)
 In an address last week honoring the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. at a black church in Atlanta, Senator Obama made waves by lecturing the audience about homophobia. ''We have scorned our gay brothers and sisters instead of embracing them,'' he said during the speech at Ebenezer Baptist Church, where Dr. King served as co-pastor with his father. 
 Joe Solmonese, the president of the Human Rights Campaign, a gay lobbying group, said he thought Mr. Obama's speech was the first time a presidential candidate had brought up gay issues in front of a nongay audience without being prompted to do so. ''This is dramatically refreshing,'' he said. ''It's a great day when we can look at a field of candidates and determine that we are comfortable with all of them on gay rights and move on to other issues.'' 
 Still, many gay leaders said they are unhappy that none of the Democrats have embraced the cause of gay marriage, even if they understood the political calculus at play. 
 ''There's a feeling that supporting gay marriage would be politically unacceptable,'' said Mr. Geto, the Clinton strategist. ''Still, we've come a long way. Four years ago, civil unions created such a huge firestorm. I think things will be different one or two election cycles from now.''

HEADLINE: Echo of First Bush: Good Economy Turns Sour

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Will George W. Bush be remembered as the president who lost the economy while trying to win a war?
 Mr. Bush has spent years presiding over an economic climate of growth that would be the envy of most presidents. Yet much to the consternation of his political advisers, he has had trouble getting credit for it, in large part because Americans were consumed by the war in Iraq.
 The chaotic events of the past week -- wild stock market swings, a major cut in the interest rate from the Federal Reserve and a rare bipartisan deal between Mr. Bush and Congressional Democrats on an economic stimulus package -- has turned that equation on its head, just in time for Mr. Bush to deliver his final State of the Union address Monday night. 
 The speech will not be filled with bold new ideas; the White House concedes that the time for ambitious plans like overhauling Social Security and revamping immigration policy is past. 
 On Iraq, the president will make the case that his troop buildup has been successful and ''remind the people of the United States what is at risk,'' a senior White House official said, speaking anonymously so as not to upstage Mr. Bush's speech. He will also press lawmakers to reauthorize a domestic surveillance law.
 But the real thrust of the speech will be the economy, as Mr. Bush himself suggested Friday during a short preview of the speech at a Congressional Republican retreat. 
 With polls showing that the economy has eclipsed Iraq on Americans' list of most pressing concerns, Mr. Bush faces the unwelcome prospect that his legacy -- which the White House always assumed would be wrapped up in the war -- will be wrapped up in hard times instead. Like his father, he risks leaving office on an economic sour note, with a reputation for spending so much time worrying about foreign affairs that he forgot about the problems of ordinary Americans at home.
 That is one reason Mr. Bush moved quickly, after an extended swing through the Middle East, to join Democrats last week in proposing a stimulus that would distribute rebate checks of up to $1,200 to 117 million families. ''Speed is of the essence,'' his treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., said in announcing the plan on Capitol Hill. 
 Thirty minutes later, Mr. Bush and Mr. Paulson were together at the White House, where the president thanked Congressional leaders ''for showing the American people that we can come together to help our nation deal with difficult economic challenges'' -- even as he insisted that the economy remains ''structurally sound.''
 The reassuring talk and emphasis on bipartisanship are smart politics, said Kenneth M. Duberstein, a former chief of staff to President Ronald Reagan who is widely credited with helping to turn around Mr. Reagan's second term. Mr. Duberstein said Iraq and the economy had been the twin pillars of Mr. Bush's presidency.
 ''In the final analysis,'' he said, ''people vote for their wallet -- what's in it, and what's not in it -- more so than Iraq or anything in foreign policy.''
 Polls show that the public feels unsettled about the future. The percentage of Americans who believe the country is on the wrong track now stands at 75 percent, while just 19 percent believe it is on the right track, according to a New York Times/CBS News poll this month. Democrats intend to capitalize on those numbers in the fall campaigns; despite joining hands with Mr. Bush on the stimulus package, they are already hammering him on the economy.
 Representative Rahm Emanuel of Illinois, the chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, has been warning for months of a looming ''Bush recession.'' The day before the stimulus deal was reached, Mr. Emanuel released a chart titled ''The Legacy of George W. Bush's Presidency,'' which contrasted a litany of economic indicators, like the price of gasoline and median household income, from 2001 to today. None favored Mr. Bush. 
 From a strictly economic perspective, it is difficult to blame Mr. Bush for the current crisis. Even some economists who have been critical of the president, like Bruce Bartlett, who worked in the Reagan and first Bush administrations, say he cannot be held liable for the burst of the housing bubble or problems in credit markets. 
 But from a political perspective, it is hard for Mr. Bush to escape. The economic expansion that came after his tax cuts has largely benefited the wealthy, which is why it is easy for Democrats like Mr. Emanuel to make the case that Mr. Bush's stewardship of the economy has created ''a middle-class squeeze.'' And if the president ends his term in a recession, it will be difficult for him to point to any real economic progress on his watch.
 Mr. Bush counters that the fundamentals of the economy are strong, even as it appears to be unraveling. He is careful to avoid the word ''recession,'' preferring to talk instead about ''economic challenges'' and ''uncertainties,'' as he did on Friday at the Republican retreat. ''We have a flexible, we have a resilient and we have a dynamic economy,'' Mr. Bush said. ''But there are some uncertainties.'' 
 Once the stimulus package is passed, the president plans to turn his attention to making his tax cuts permanent, an approach that Joel Kaplan, the deputy White House chief of staff, said would provide ''the foundation for continued economic growth.''
 ''And I think the historical record will reflect that,'' Mr. Kaplan said.
 Still, for the White House, there are obstacles ahead. Democrats are unlikely to agree to extending the tax cuts and, despite the seeming bipartisan enthusiasm for the stimulus package, it could run into trouble on Capitol Hill. Even if the package does pass, some economists -- Mr. Bartlett among them -- believe it will do little to improve the nation's economic health, leaving Mr. Bush vulnerable to accusations that he did too little, too late.
 Mr. Bush has roughly 51 weeks left in office. He had hoped to spend the time focused on creating peace in the Middle East and stability in Iraq. Now he has a new battle on the home front. And here in Washington, where finger-pointing is practically a pastime, the economic blame game has only just begun.

HEADLINE: Looking for Eyeballs Suddenly on a Budget Rapid Changes Since 2001 Cloud Outlook for Viewers

BYLINE: By BRIAN STELTER

 BODY:
A few months ago, media companies were facing declining readership, flat advertising and the prospect of a damaging writers' strike. 
 Those were the days. Now, after widespread worries about the economy culminating in a worldwide sell-off last week, producers and distributors have another worry: trying to divine what a possible recession means for consumers and advertisers.
 For television and film companies, a recession could compound the effects of the Writers Guild of America strike, which has stopped virtually all scripted television production. The strike has already driven cost cuts by some movie and television studios: last week, NBC Universal said it would try to save $50 million by paring back on its pilots for next season. 
 Further belt-tightening would probably make inexpensive series and sequels look more attractive than big-budget scripted spectacles in the theaters and reality shows more appealing for television. Good for fans of ''Superbad'' and ''American Gladiators,'' not so good for those who prefer ''Atonement'' or ''Lost.'' 
 Already, media investors are bracing themselves. Media company stocks are down roughly 25 to 30 percent in the last year, said Jessica Reif Cohen, the chief media analyst at Merrill Lynch.
 ''I would say we're nearly priced in for a recession,'' Ms. Cohen said. ''But that doesn't mean the sector's stocks will outperform. There's probably still some more downside.''
 Some media company executives have said they were already adjusting their business plans. Jeff Zucker, the chief executive of NBC Universal, said last week that the recession was real and that NBC would ''have to manage our business accordingly.'' But Peter F. Chernin, the chief operating officer of the News Corporation, said three weeks ago that he saw ''no sign of any slowdown in our businesses.''
 The Walt Disney Company, which, in addition to its movie studios and television networks, operates theme parks, could be especially vulnerable. Its theme park revenue declined after the economic downturns of 1991 and 2001 (some of the latter decline was associated with the decline in travel after Sept. 11). One factor in Disney's favor is the weak American dollar, which has been drawing international visitors to the parks -- Walt Disney World in Florida, for instance, had a 10 percent rise in overseas visitors in the first 10 months of 2007 compared with the same period in 2006, according to Merrill Lynch. Ed Moran, a media analyst for the consulting firm Deloitte, said he thought consumers' appetites for entertainment and information might prove to be immune to the hard times. ''It's clear that advertising might take a hit during a recession, but there seems to be a lot of evidence that people continue to consume the same amount,'' he said. 
 What choices consumers might make is less clear. One axiom that grew out of the Depression was that, in bad times, people go to the movies. Box office data from more recent downturns show conflicting signs on ticket sales: total box office grosses fell in the economic contractions of 1990 and 1991 but rose in the recession in the early 1980s. Ticket prices have soared since then, making the impact of a bear market hard to predict. ''Still, relative to other venues like sports or concerts, movie theater tickets are much less expensive,'' said Marla S. Backer, an industry analyst at Soleil Research.
 If they avoid movie theaters, consumers may look to other media. ''When people can no longer afford a vacation or a trip to the movies, TV has always been that last resort,'' said Robert J. Thompson, a professor of media and popular culture at Syracuse University. 
 Forecasting is difficult because many viewing alternatives like cable channels, digital video recorders, mail-order movie services and video downloads were not widely available during the most recent downturn in 2001. And historical ratings for television do not show any obvious correlation with economic swings.
 Cable networks have historically been seen as relatively recession-proof, partially because they generate revenue from affiliate fees as well as from advertising. Analysts say customers are typically unlikely to cancel their cable service, although they may cut down on premium services like HBO. It may become harder for cable operators to sign up new customers, Ms. Cohen said.
 Similarly, the home video market, already a troubled sector, may be one of the most exposed in a recession, both for rental retailers like Blockbuster and for sales outlets like electronics stores. ''Even though it's a relatively low-cost item, it is often an impulse buy,'' Ms. Cohen said. ''Given gas prices, we're starting to hear retailers say that people are taking fewer trips to the store, meaning there are fewer times they can have that impulse purchase.''
 Wal-Mart Stores recently reported its first annual drop in DVD sales in a decade, said Alan Gould, an analyst for the investment bank Natixis Bleichroeder. ''Home video is probably the biggest revenue source for the studios right now, and that business is feeling some saturation and some competition,'' Mr. Gould said. He said he did not expect movie studios to skimp on film production in a recession.
 Even if people watch network or cable TV at the same rate, they may watch different shows. Tim Brooks, an author of ''The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows,'' said there has historically been a relationship between the mood of the country and the type of shows that are popular. 
 Amid the mid-1970s recession, shows depicting previous generations and old-fashioned values, like ''Happy Days'' and ''The Waltons,'' took hold, he noted. ''The dominant kinds of programming we have, have shifted somewhat from gritty crime shows to reality shows that are in many cases very escapist,'' Mr. Brooks said, pointing to feel-good shows like ''American Idol.''
 Advertising tends to be a lagging indicator of a recession. A number of media analysts have said they expect ad revenue to slow in the spring. While political spending and advertising for the Summer Olympic Games may somewhat mask the expected downturn, at least for TV networks, the short-term gains could ''mute any economic recovery in 2009'' for the companies that benefit from this year's ad spending, Morgan Stanley stated in a report last week.
 Some media companies may suffer more than others in a recession. The newspaper industry, which is already reeling from years of flat revenue, could be particularly hard hit. Already this year, the publishers of The Minneapolis Star Tribune and The Philadelphia Inquirer have warned about further job losses, and the editor of The Los Angeles Times resigned rather than make further cuts to his newsroom budget. 
 A Goldman Sachs forecast this month said the challenges for newspaper owners would be intensified ''by a cyclical downturn in 2008, particularly affecting the classified categories, resulting in what we believe will be the industry's weakest revenue performance since 2001.'' The report forecast a 7.9 percent drop in newspaper revenue, a change from the previous estimate of a 2.6 percent decline. That figure could grow worse, particular if the Hollywood studios, already feeling the effects of the strike, cut back on movie advertising.
 The same Goldman Sachs report predicted one unlikely winner among media choices: video games. Previous generations of video game consoles have proved popular in recessions, and the sector is growing rapidly: the market research firm NPD estimates that United States video game sales will surpass $10 billion in 2008, partly because of a strong slate of upcoming games.
 ''Video game sales are in the home and, frankly, video games are perhaps one of the cheapest forms of entertainment on a dollar per hour basis there is,'' wrote Jon C. Ogg, the editor of the blog 24/7 Wall St., two weeks ago.

HEADLINE: After Obama Victory, Clinton's Camp Seeks Gentler Role for Ex-President

BYLINE: By PATRICK HEALY; Jeff Zeleny contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Democrats inside and outside the Clinton campaign on Sunday debated and in some cases bemoaned the degree to which former President Bill Clinton's criticism of Senator Barack Obama last week had inflicted lasting damage on his wife's presidential candidacy.
 ''I think his harsh style hurt Senator Clinton -- it polarized the campaign and polarized the electorate, and it also made it harder for Senator Clinton's positive message to break through,'' said Celinda Lake, a Democratic strategist and pollster who is not affiliated with any of the candidates. 
 Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign team, seeking to readjust after her lopsided defeat in South Carolina and amid a sense among many Democrats that Mr. Clinton had injected himself clumsily into the race, will try to shift the former president back into the sunnier, supportive-spouse role that he played before Mrs. Clinton's loss in the Iowa caucuses, Clinton advisers said.
 But Democrats said it was not clear whether the effects of Mr. Clinton's high profile could be brushed away by having him modulate his campaign style. They said Mr. Clinton had upset some of the central themes of Mrs. Clinton's campaign, including her appeal to women and her assertions that her time in the White House during the 1990s amounted to vital experience rather than a link to a presidency defined as much by scandal and partisan divisions as by its successes on fronts like the economy.
 Despite Mrs. Clinton's months-long efforts to build a base of support among women, Clinton advisers said they were concerned that her husband's recent prominence may have dampened her appeal as a strong female leader. Some advisers said they feared as much after Mr. Obama won 54 percent of the vote from women in South Carolina, including 22 percent of white women and 78 percent of black women, according to polls.
 Echoing private remarks by some Clinton advisers, Linda L. Fowler, a professor of government at Dartmouth College, said in an interview that she believed Mr. Clinton's attacks on Mr. Obama had hurt Mrs. Clinton.
 ''Voters don't like the idea of a co-presidency, and he became so high profile that he made people begin to see this as a possible co-presidency,'' Ms. Fowler said. ''It's even more problematic because she's a woman. It looks like she either needs him to fight the big battles for her, or she can't keep the big dog on the porch.''
 After a week of all-out campaigning by Mr. Clinton in South Carolina, where Mrs. Clinton came in a distant second to Mr. Obama, there is also fresh concern among some advisers that Mr. Clinton's visibility has dented her argument that she has the best experience for the job. 
 These advisers expressed concern that the specter of a co-candidacy and co-presidency could bring back elements of the Clinton history that many Democrats would just as soon leave behind.
 Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York, a leading supporter of Mrs. Clinton, said on Sunday that Mr. Clinton was going to pull back. ''He's got to,'' Mr. Rangel said. ''The focus has got to get back on Hillary. For all that he cares about his wife, this has to be her election to win, and it's become too much about his role.''
 Yet some advisers expressed concern that Mr. Clinton might prove difficult to rein in, citing the latest furor over the weekend after he compared Mr. Obama's victories to Jesse Jackson's in 1984 and 1988 on Saturday, though Mr. Jackson did not approach the wide margin of Mr. Obama's win. 
 Advisers said Mr. Clinton's remark was an off-the-cuff reference, but it was debated on the Sunday news shows and in the blogosphere as a possible effort by the Clinton camp to diminish Mr. Obama's success in South Carolina as simply the result of a black candidate drawing support from a heavily black electorate. 
 Mr. Obama, asked about the remark on the ABC program ''This Week With George Stephanopoulos,'' mostly sought to praise Mr. Jackson -- a supporter of his -- while decrying the injection of race into the campaign.
 ''Jesse Jackson ran historic races in 1984 and 1988, and there's no doubt that that set a precedent for African-Americans running for the highest office in the land,'' Mr. Obama said. ''I think people want change. I think they want to get beyond some of the racial politics that, you know, has been so dominant in the past.''
 Mr. Clinton's ability to be a distraction was evident on Sunday as reporters repeatedly asked Mrs. Clinton about her husband's role in the campaign and his comments about Mr. Jackson, which she characterized as benign.
 ''I think everyone who knows Bill knows that he's both a great student of politics and history, but he's also somebody who brought our country together,'' Mrs. Clinton told reporters in Memphis.
 Clinton advisers said that Mr. Clinton would continue to campaign nearly full time for his wife in the days leading up to the Feb. 5 primaries and caucuses in 22 states, yet they added that he would take a more positive tone.
 They said his role would be akin to his effort before the Iowa caucuses, when he highlighted Mrs. Clinton's record and her policy ideas, and was used in part to build huge crowds on college campuses rather than attack Mr. Obama. (It was after her third-place finish in Iowa that Mr. Clinton turned much more aggressive.) The campaign announced Sunday night that Mr. Clinton would speak on Tuesday at a college in New Jersey, which has a Feb. 5 primary.
 ''Bill Clinton is going to continue to campaign on behalf of his wife and tell her story and make his case about why she should be president,'' said Howard Wolfson, Mrs. Clinton's communications director.
 Mr. Wolfson said the campaign would turn its focus to the Florida primary, which is Tuesday, although that primary is considered little more than a beauty contest. 
 And Mrs. Clinton will not campaign in Florida -- honoring a pledge that the Democratic candidates took after the state moved up its primary date against the national party's wishes -- though her campaign said she would hold an event in Florida on Tuesday night as the primary results come in.

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths KLEIN, JOHN A.

 BODY:
 KLEIN--John A., President and Chief Executive Officer of People's United Bank and its parent, People's United Financial, Inc. passed away January 25 at Yale-New Haven Hospital. He was 58 years old. John leaves his wife and high school sweetheart, Carla, to whom he was married for 37 years, and his two children and their spouses: Kristen Chiodo and her husband Chuck and Eric and his wife Allison. 
He had been looking forward to the arrival of Kristen and Chuck's baby -his first grandchild -who is due to be born in February. He is also survived by his sister Patricia and her husband Daniel Snow, of Norwalk, his brother Peter, of Florida, and his mother-in-law Almira Salomonsen, of Orange. John was born in Bridgeport on March 19, 1949. He grew up in Milford and graduated from Jonathan Law High School in 1967. He attended Columbia University and graduated from the University of Connecticut in 1971. John joined what was then known as People's Savings Bank, Bridgeport in December, 1971 as a management trainee. Later, while working full time at the bank, he attended the University of Connecticut Law School at night. Following his graduation from law school in 1977, he became the bank's first in-house lawyer and was appointed its General Counsel in 1984. Over the next fifteen years, he served in a variety of positions of increasing responsibility at People's United, culminating in his appointment as Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of the bank in 1999. During his eight year tenure as Chief Executive Officer, John focused his efforts on ensuring that the bank would be able to meet the challenges of banking in the twenty-first century, while maintaining its culture and community focus. He effectively steered the bank through the difficult economy of the early 2000s, and when the bank determined it was necessary to sell its credit card business, he successfully negotiated a sale that retained the jobs in Bridgeport. Last year, John led the bank's conversion to full public stockholder ownership. The bank's new holding company, People's United Financial, Inc., raised approximately $3.4 billion in the offering, making it one of the largest stock offerings in United States history. Most recently under John's leadership, the bank completed the acquisition of Chittenden Corporation, expanding People's United to approximately $22 billion in assets and more than 300 branches in six states. John was also Chairman of the Board of the People's United Community Foundation, which he believed reflected the bank's ongoing commitment to community betterment. In addition to his involvement with the bank's outreach, John held leadership roles with a broad array of community and business organizations. These included: the board of directors of Bridgeport Hospital and YaleNew Haven Health; the Bridgeport Regional Business Council; the Greater Bridgeport Area Foundation; and The Business Council of Fairfield County. John also was a board member of the Connecticut Bankers Association, the Connecticut Business and Industry Association, and a member of the Connecticut Bar Association. Inspired by the example of his wife Carla, a longtime teacher, John was an advocate of the importance of education and, particularly, public education. He believed that a strong public educational system is critical to Connecticuts long term success and prosperity, and, as a proud graduate of the University of Connecticut (and a devoted Huskies fan), he was an enthusiastic supporter of UCONN. John was dedicated to supporting research aimed at making a difference in the fight against esophageal cancer. Following his treatment at the University of Michigan, John and Carla worked with the university to establish the John A. and Carla S. Klein Family Research Professorship in Thoracic Surgery to support a faculty member whose research focuses on diseases of the esophagus. Calling hours will take place on Monday, January 28, 2008 from 4-8pm in the Abriola Parkview Funeral Home, 419 White Plains Rd., Trumbull, CT. A memorial service will take place on Tuesday, January 29, 2008 beginning at 11am at the Klein Memorial Auditorium, 910 Fairfield Ave., Bridgeport, CT. In lieu of flowers, the family asks that donations be made to the University of Michigan in support of the John A. and Carla S. Klein Family Research Professorship in Thoracic Surgery. University of Michigan, Department of Surgery, 1500 E. Medical Center Dr., 2110 Taubman Center, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-5346. For travel directions and more information visit us at abriola.com.

The Plan to Save eBay: Better Search
 How will eBay fend off the growing challenge from Google?
 On its rival's own turf: search.
 EBay has struggled to offer even the most basic search engine that will let users find the products they want.
 ''Today our buyers tell us that we know you have unmatched selection, but we can't always find what we want and find values as fast as we want,'' said John Donahoe in an interview last week shortly after being named the successor to Meg Whitman as chief executive of eBay. 
 Now the company is working on something far more ambitious: a system that will evaluate customer feedback, data from its PayPal payment system, shipping costs and other factors to present the very best deals to shoppers.
 ''With eBay and PayPal, we have more closed transaction data than anyone else on the Internet,'' Mr. Donahoe said. ''On eBay we have data about what people actually purchased and bought. As we begin to capture and use that data, we believe we can provide the most relevant search experience that takes that inventory we have and delivers it to a buyer so they have good choice.''
 For example, he said, ''sellers that provide reasonable and fast shipping, even free shipping, will rise to the top.''
 Mr. Donahoe also proposes a way of combining fixed-price listings, which are appropriate for new products, and auctions, which are the best way to find prices for unique, older and used merchandise.
 Right now, fixed-price goods can be bought on the main eBay site, on its eBay Express site that is devoted to them, and on its Shopping.com site, which combines offers from larger online stores. Mr. Donahoe suggests that in the future all these options will be presented on a single page of search results from eBay's main site.
 ''Let's say you wanted to buy a BlackBerry,'' he said. ''Last time I checked we had 25,000 BlackBerry listings. That is a fairly confusing experience. A year from now you will be able to say, 'I want a BlackBerry. Boom. Show me the latest models and the cheapest price.' ''
 The same screen, he added, will show used and older models as well.
 ''We also want to surface the six-month-old version, still brand new, that may be in an auction format because its value is less certain,'' he said. SAUL HANSELL
 Tracking
 Global Appetite 
 For Innovation
 In its quest for what it calls ''new metrics for the knowledge economy,'' a nonprofit research group has come up with an index of global innovation confidence.
 The poll of 25,000 people in a dozen nations, published on Tuesday, found the United States squarely in the middle of the pack. America trailed the nations that most enthusiastic about new technology, gadgets and services, a group that included the United Arab Emirates, India, Brazil, Ireland and China. Still, the United States came out ahead of the Europeans; the least thrilled by technology were the Netherlands, Finland, Slovenia and Turkey.
 Jonathan Levie, author of the study and a senior lecturer at the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow, noted that the nations most confident about innovation tended to be fast-growing economies with young populations. Innovation confidence, he said, doesn't closely track consumer confidence, as one might expect. So it is a separate sentiment.
 But innovation confidence, Mr. Levie said, does show a strong correlation with age worldwide. ''We find that innovation confidence starts dropping after people reach 40,'' he said.
 A sign of wisdom or technological exhaustion? Further research, it seems, is required.
 That is precisely what the Institute for Innovation and Information Productivity, the group that sponsored the index, has in mind. The group plans to conduct the innovation confidence studies annually as part of its broader research agenda as it seeks to measure what works and what doesn't in the knowledge economy -- as opposed to the industrial economy.

 At Sundance,
 A Second Life Sweatshop Is Art
 One of the more exotic premieres at this year's Sundance Film Festival is ''Invisible Threads.'' It's not a movie, but a virtual sweatshop that exists only on Second Life, the online virtual world, to produce real-life, custom-ordered, personalized blue jeans.
 Stephanie Rothenberg, a new media performance artist, and her collaborator, Jeff Crouse, a digital artist and programmer, started Invisible Threads a year ago while at Eyebeam, an art and technology center in New York. Invisible Threads is intended as art, but they see it as a window into so-called telemetric manufacturing methods of the future.
 The jeans are being shown and sold for the first time at Sundance in a beta version. Customers tell the Invisible Threads staff the size and style of jeans they would like; the instructions are sent to the virtual factory inside Second Life, where workers push buttons that generate an image. From that image, a pattern is created and sent to an industrial printer, made by Hewlett-Packard, which spits out the custom-printed canvas cotton patterns. The patterns are then cut and assembled at the Sundance Festival with a glue gun and a little stitching for reinforcement. The jeans cost around $35.
 The margins are enviable. The Invisible Threads ''factory'' has 16 workers, who are paid 200 Lindens an hour -- about 90 cents, which is pretty good pay by Second Life standards. Factory workers are also granted 500 square meters of Second Life ''land'' on which to build a house.
 ''What I think is fascinating about her work is that it is a step toward what our future is going to be,'' said Jeffrey Winter, a panel programmer for the Sundance Festival who focuses on media, art and technology. ''It's called art now, but in the future it's going to be how you get your jeans. It will be daily life. So often what you call art is just people who see the future before the rest of us do.''

HEADLINE: Saving Our Oceans

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Your timely Jan. 21 editorial, ''Until All the Fish Are Gone,'' correctly underscores the growing negative environmental and social effects of overfishing. What once seemed simply a conservation concern is now a global issue with tremendous social and economic ramifications. 
 We are fast approaching a critical crossroads in the future of our oceans. But unlike many other global issues, where business and the environmental community are often at odds, here we completely agree on a solution.
 Members of the World Trade Organization are now negotiating new trade rules to reduce the government subsidies that promote overfishing. These subsidies provide fleets with money, fuel and incentives to fish longer, harder and farther than ever before. As a result, fish populations are declining, along with the quality of life of people around the world who depend on fishing for food and livelihood.
 Reducing fishing subsidies is the single greatest action that can be taken to protect the world's oceans. 
 Will the W.T.O. members seize the opportunity to stop overfishing and begin restoring the health of the oceans, and in turn, the health of mankind? That is the question. 
 Peter M. Robinson Andrew F. Sharpless New York, Jan. 22, 2008 Mr. Robinson is president and chief executive of the United States Council for International Business. Mr. Sharpless is chief executive of Oceana, an international environmental ocean advocacy group.

 From John Tierney's blog, nytimes.com/tierneylab. 
 What are the warning signs for a gadget addict? John O'Neill, director of addiction services for the Menninger Clinic, has identified five general ones, like being unable to leave home without a gadget or refusing to heed pleas from families and friends to stop. But are there more specific signs of a gadgetolic -- or should that be gadgict? 
 From Chris: You know someone's an addict when they are caught by their children in their front hall closet ... thumbing away on their CrackBerry. ... Sorry, Sis.
 c. congdon: You think a lap dance is what happens when your cellphone vibrates in your pants.
 malnicore: You know you are a gadgict when you inadvertently bump into the real world, collapse into a virtual pool of despair, and click on ''My God, what am I doing?'' 
 Deborah: I bought a pair of those mittens that can flip back to expose gloves without fingertips for the sole purpose of making wintertime texting easier. 
 caryjm: Oh Deborah, you may need in-patient rehab. You are almost too far gone. I'm running out to buy myself a pair. 
 Well
 From Tara Parker-Pope's blog, nytimes.com/well.
 Forget the flowers, reception hall and wedding dress. For most brides-to-be, according to a new study from Cornell, losing weight is the most important part of the wedding plan.
 To reach the perfect wedding-day weight, more than a third use extreme dieting tactics like diet pills and fasting. One in seven buys a bridal gown one or more sizes smaller than what she normally wears.
 The authors note that because brides-to-be are highly motivated to lose weight, doctors should use a coming wedding as an opportunity to discuss more healthful weight-loss and eating behaviors.
 From Kate: You're minimizing and perhaps trivializing disordered eating. It's extremely dangerous and most definitely not funny.
 Gregory A.: What about the grooms? Women are expected to torture themselves and abuse their bodies to be ''perfect'' ... on their wedding day, while the dudes just have to show up shaved, in a clean shirt and not too obviously hung over from the bachelor party.
 Dot Earth
 From Andrew C. Revkin's blog, nytimes.com/dotearth.
 We all love lists of winners and losers, and an obliging research team at Yale and Columbia has been trying to refine one that regularly ranks countries on their environmental performance. Switzerland is on top; Niger is last at 149th. The United States ranks 39th, below all of the other Group of 8 industrialized nations. Albania is 25th, Russia 28th.
 From Simon D.: It may simply be geography. Many of the (former) colonies, whether Canada, Tajikistan or Malaysia, were conquered by the colonial powers because of ample natural resources. Those countries then established natural-resource-based or extractive economies that supported the former colonial powers.
 cynthia: Looks like we have 38 case studies available from which we can copy that which works and is transferable, and dispense with whatever does not.

HEADLINE: Legal Delays Tax More Than the Nets' Patience

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR. 
E-mail: sportsbiz@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Choose the most pressing problem for the Nets:
 a) Their 18-26 record puts them only three and a half games ahead of the Knicks.
 b) Vince Carter finished fourth in a Sports Illustrated poll of N.B.A. players who get the least out of their talent, but he was seen by his 242 colleagues as just slightly more of an overachiever than the Knicks' perennially underachieving Eddy Curry.
 c) Jason Kidd would rather play for a team that is not three and a half games up on the Knicks. 
 d) The financial markets are a mess, which is not the fault of Isiah Thomas.
 The right answer is (d), unless the Knicks overtake the Nets this season, which would be the supreme crisis of the ownership of Bruce Ratner.
 If you chose (d), then you sensed that it will be riskier and more expensive than ever envisioned for the Nets to construct the Barclays Center arena that is part of the $4 billion Atlantic Yards project proposed to be built near downtown Brooklyn. 
 Once, the Nets optimistically believed they could send change-of-address cards in time for the 2006-7 season, but that dream has been deferred to sometime in 2010. If financing for the arena is not in place by October, moving day will not be until 2011.
 Turns out the Devils, Yankees, Mets, Giants and Jets were lucky to have financed their pleasure palaces before the financial crisis. The problem, which began with the tanking of subprime mortgage loans, has led to sharply higher interest rates for loans to highly leveraged companies, such as real estate developers, if they can obtain financing at all.
 When Standard & Poor's gave investment-grade ratings to $1.6 billion in bonds to finance the new Yankees and Mets ballparks in 2006, ''It was a fairly stable market with a lot of liquidity,'' said Jodi Hecht, the director of project finance for S&P.
 Now, Sal Galatioto, a sports industry banker, said, ''The banks aren't completely out of the market and the bond market is still there. But the risk is continued delay.''
 The souring of the credit market was acknowledged by the Nets in an affidavit filed last week in state court by Andrew Silberfein, an executive vice president of Ratner's company, Forest City Ratner, which is developing Atlantic Yards. Forest City is a development partner in the new Midtown headquarters building of The New York Times.
 Silberfein wrote that the credit markets are ''in turmoil,'' with lenders and bond insurers ''facing financial difficulties'' and ''becoming much more cautious.'' 
 He added, ''It is not clear what the financial climate will be in several months, when the arena bond financing is made available to the public.''
 Silberfein's affidavit, which was first reported in The New York Post, was designed to persuade the state Appellate Division to expedite the appeal of a lawsuit filed by Brooklyn community groups and dismissed earlier this month by a Supreme Court justice in Manhattan. The lawsuit argued, among other things, that a state agency's environmental review of the project was flawed.
 Time is money and time is risk, the affidavit said. The coalition may get nine months to file its appeal, although it probably would not need all that time; Forest City Ratner wants the appeal heard sooner so it can sell its bonds and start building. 
 As long as the court case stays unresolved, Silberfein predicted ''significant difficulties and cost increases'' in the bond financing.
 Daniel Goldstein, a spokesman for Develop Don't Destroy Brooklyn, a coalition of civic groups opposed to Atlantic Yards, chuckled when asked if the full-court legal press by the anti-Ratner forces has serendipitously dragged on long enough to give the credit crisis time to make Forest City's financing a few levels more difficult. Opponents of the project are also appealing last year's dismissal of a federal eminent domain lawsuit.
 ''It's always been a high-risk project, and with the state of the credit, housing and stock markets, it's even more high-risk,'' Goldstein said. 
 ''It didn't need to be. But it's not news to anyone that a firm that is so reliant on credit is having a problem.''
 Goldman Sachs -- the lead manager of the arena financing and the group that has done the deals for the Yankees' ballpark and the Giants' half of their new stadium with the Jets -- cannot wrap up deals without the cessation of legal hostilities. 
 ''We're working on it to close later in the year,'' said Greg Carey, a managing director at Goldman Sachs. ''We like the deal.'' 
 Forest City issued a statement to counter public doubt about its resolve. ''Let's be very clear,'' said Bruce Bender, an executive vice president, ''Atlantic Yards and Barclays Center are coming to Brooklyn. Period.''
 Should the Nets finally reach the shores of Brooklyn, they will most likely be much less of a financial drain on Forest City Enterprises, of which Forest City Ratner is a subsidiary. From August 2004, when the Nets became a Ratner property, through the nine months that ended last Oct. 31, the company's share in the Nets' losses has totaled $75.2 million.
 And Jim Dolan cannot be blamed for a cent of it.

HEADLINE: The City Is the Future of the Suburbs, and Other Heresies

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE DOWNES

 BODY:
The suburbs are dead. People always say that, and if you live in suburbia you expect to hear it, particularly from teenagers who are convinced that growing up there comes at some cost to their souls. Still it is remarkable to hear that dire diagnosis from the leaders of the two counties that make up Long Island, America's emblematic suburb, and home of the original Levittown. 
 The county executives, Thomas Suozzi of Nassau and Steve Levy of Suffolk, will tell anyone who listens that there is no better place to live. But speaking last week before a group of fellow politicians, businesspeople and academics, the two leaders were just as emphatic in insisting that Long Island's defining trait -- a house with one family and two cars, and another house next door, and another, and another -- was defunct. 
 Long Islanders might be doing O.K., but the postwar vision that brought them there, the dream of paving the potato fields, watering the lawn and worshiping the car, was over. 
 Their supporting evidence was the Long Island Index, an annual survey by a nonprofit foundation that examined Nassau and Suffolk through a host of statistical lenses and found a lot to be grim about, including crushing taxes and a lagging economy. The prime source of malaise, the report asserted, was Long Island's staggering housing costs, which were causing an exodus of young people and keeping employers from moving in. 
 Mr. Suozzi, Mr. Levy and other speakers argued that Long Island's future was no longer bucolic and sprawling, but dense, urban and vertical. They said that the land of parkways and subdivisions could shake off its blahs only by building up -- by filling neglected downtowns with taller buildings, apartments, townhouses, stores and parking garages, and enhancing mass transit. 
 Mr. Suozzi and Mr. Levy have seen the future, and the future is Westchester County, where the John Cheever suburbs have a newly revived city in the middle, White Plains, with gleaming hotels and condos and enough of the buzz and sheen of gentrification and tax-generation to make any budget-writing politician happy.
 But is that what regular Long Islanders really want? 
 The authors of the Long Island Index found a few joyous nuggets. One is that a significant number of Long Islanders (38 percent) said they could see themselves living someday in a downtown apartment, condo or townhouse, forsaking the old Levittown ideal for something walkable, interesting and, above all, affordable. Half of the respondents could imagine a child or parent doing so. Sixty-one percent supported building more homes and apartments in some downtowns, and 49 percent said they would favor taller downtown buildings -- up to four stories, from two.
 From these modest statistics, some optimists have detected a sea change in Long Island attitudes. I'm not so sure. 
 The two county executives are right to recognize that Long Island, hemmed by sea and Sound, cannot grow outward. They know that an economy needs businesses, businesses need workers and workers need a place to live that isn't their parents' basement and doesn't swallow half their salaries.
 This argument has been made over and over, but with no appreciable effect. Long Island is a land of bedrooms, not an incubator of urban-planning concepts, and for every smart-growth PowerPoint or op-ed article favoring townhouses, you will have at least 50 enraged citizens who will show up at a public hearing to denounce it.
 Here are some other statistics from the same report that hint at the mountain of Not In My Backyard feeling that pro-density forces will have to wear down if they are going to build anything close to the 200,000 units that some experts say Long Island will need in the next 25 years to solve its housing crisis. 
 Fifty-nine percent of Long Islanders could never imagine themselves living in an apartment. Asked which type of neighborhood they preferred -- one where you could walk to stores or one that required driving -- 56 percent said they would rather drive. Meanwhile, only 7 percent agreed that ''creating ethnically and economically diverse neighborhoods'' was the major advantage of building more affordable housing. Asked what the worst disadvantage was, 20 percent said ''bringing in the wrong kinds of people.''
 The pollsters asked respondents to choose their favorite downtown on Long Island, and the winner wasn't even a downtown. The top vote-getter, at 20 percent, was ''the mall.''

HEADLINE: Profit at American Express Is Reduced by Loan Reserves

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
American Express, the credit card and travel services company, said on Monday that fourth-quarter profit fell 10 percent, hurt by a charge to bolster reserves for bad loans. 
 Net income for the company declined to $831 million, or 71 cents a share, compared with $922 million, or 75 cents, in the period a year earlier.
 Profit from continuing operations was 71 cents a share. That matched the average forecast by analysts, according to Reuters Estimates.
 Net revenue rose 10 percent, to $7.36 billion. Analysts on average expected revenue of $7.78 billion.
 The company released its results after markets closed. Shares of American Express fell 2.9 percent in after-hours electronic trading, dropping $1.39, to $46.01. They had ended regular trading up $1.96, or 4.3 percent, at $47.40 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
 Results included a $438 million charge, or $274 million after taxes, to increase loss reserves as consumer credit quality, especially in California and Florida, showed signs of weakness.
 American Express had announced plans for a charge on Jan. 10, worrying investors who had thought its wealthier cardholders might be less likely to experience financial pressure as the economy slowed. Lower consumer spending could result in lower card fees.
 ''We are not immune from further deterioration in the economic and credit environment,'' the chief executive, Kenneth I. Chenault, said in a statement. ''We believe our focus on the premium sector should help us to weather the current conditions better than many competitors.''
 Mr. Chenault said his outlook for 2008 remained ''cautious,'' with slower earnings growth. For all of 2007, profit rose 8 percent, to $4.01 billion.
 On Jan. 23, Capital One Financial, another large card issuer, said fourth-quarter profit fell 42 percent.

HEADLINE: New Homes Set Record: Sales Fell 26% in '07

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
The housing industry, caught in a maelstrom of sinking demand, rising foreclosures and bulging inventories, is in its worst slump in decades, a growing body of economic evidence shows.
 Sales of new homes fell last year by 26 percent, the steepest drop since records began in 1963, the Commerce Department said. 
 Last week, the National Association of Realtors reported that sales of previously owned single-family homes, a large portion of the overall housing market, dropped the most on an annual basis in 25 years. And the median price of those homes fell for the first time in at least four decades. 
 Some economists predict the market may start to recover in the summer. Others are less optimistic. ''There is no sign of a bottom in any of these data,'' wrote Ian C. Shepherdson, a London-based economist at High Frequency Economics. Last month alone, sales of new homes tumbled 4.7 percent, to a 604,000 annual rate, the smallest monthly sales figure since February 1995. 
 Prices also fell sharply. In December, the median price of a new home fell to $219,200, down 10.9 percent from December 2006. 
 ''No matter which way you look at it, the December new-home sales report is simply awful,'' wrote Dimitry Fleming, an economist at ING Bank. 
 December capped a painful year for home builders, who watched demand dry up as buyers abandoned contracts or stayed on the sidelines with the expectation that prices would fall further. For the year, the median price of new homes rose just 0.2 percent, to $246,900. 
 A wave of foreclosures and tightened lending standards have made it more difficult to obtain a mortgage, even for buyers with good credit. And banks have been more reluctant to lend in light of the subprime mortgage crisis.
 Builders are trying to lure buyers by dropping prices and throwing in incentives like new appliances. They have also cut back on new construction. 
 But the strategy has failed to make a dent in inventories: the backlog of new homes on the market ticked up last month to 9.6 months' supply based on the current sales rate, the Commerce Department said.
 Sales of new homes were down in December in most regions, with the steepest declines in the South and West. Midwest sales fell slightly, and there was a small uptick in the Northeast.
 Compared with December 2006, sales decreased 56 percent in the Midwest, 43 percent in the West, 36 percent in the South and 27 percent in the Northeast.
 The Commerce Department also lowered its numbers for new-home sales in November, to a 634,000 annual pace. It originally estimated a rate of 647,000.
 Jobless Rate Flat in Japan
 TOKYO (Reuters) -- Japan's jobless rate was flat in December, the government said Tuesday, while overall household spending and retail sales rose modestly in December from a year earlier. 
 The unemployment rate was 3.8 percent in December, slightly less than the 3.9 percent expected. The jobless rate has crept up from a nine-year low of 3.6 percent in July, suggesting the market was stalling as small companies, which employ 7 out of 10 workers, have held back. 
 Overall household spending rose 2.2 percent percent in December from a year earlier, to the surprise of economists who had expected a 0.2 percent fall. 
 Retail sales rose 0.2 percent in December from a year earlier, slightly higher than a consensus forecast for a 0.1 percent rise.

HEADLINE: Perception And Angst At Davos

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN. 
The latest news on mergers and acquisitions can be found at nytimes.com/dealbook

DATELINE: DAVOS, Switzerland 

 BODY:
''Behind every great fortune there is a great crime,'' David M. Rubenstein said with a sardonic smile. 
 Mr. Rubenstein, the founding partner of the Carlyle Group, one of the country's largest private equity funds, doesn't really believe that famous quote from the French writer Honore de Balzac. Or at least he doesn't believe it applies to his industry.
 But he certainly understands why many people might take that view of the enormous wealth that has accrued to private equity partners during the last decade. Indeed, given the hard times that private equity is now confronting -- and the way the industry has been attacked by politicians and the general public -- he'd be a fool not to realize it. (And David Rubenstein is no fool.)
 Last week was a good time to check in on the state of private equity, because most of the private equity bigwigs -- including Mr. Rubenstein, Henry Kravis of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, Stephen A. Schwarzman of Blackstone Group, Leon Black of Apollo Management, Glenn Hutchins of Silver Lake and Jonathan Nelson of Providence Equity -- were gathered in one place: Davos, the site of the annual World Economic Forum. 
 On the one hand, there was a distinct feeling at Davos that private equity was not on the hot seat -- at least not as Topic A among the world's economists and financiers. This time it was the sovereign wealth funds that got most of the scrutiny. ''We're no longer the object of so much scorn and attention,'' said Mr. Rubenstein one morning, as he trudged through the snow, wearing a North Face ski jacket over his banker's pinstripes. 
 On the other hand, back here in the real world, private equity -- and all it represents -- remains as contentious as ever. Just days before arriving in Davos, Mr. Rubenstein was swarmed by some 50 protesters during a speech at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. 
 The protesters, who were escorted out of the auditorium by the police, had come to protest Carlyle's acquisition of a nursing home company. Among other things, they were championing efforts to establish a union at the company -- which of course would impair Carlyle's efforts to cut costs if it were successful.
 As a protester with a megaphone challenged him, Mr. Rubenstein shot back -- sarcastically -- ''I think a remedial English course would be helpful.'' (He later called the protester and apologized.)
 When Mr. Rubenstein was finally able to begin his speech again, he began by saying that the Golden Age of private equity -- a phrase coined by Mr. Kravis at the peak of the buyout boom -- had turned into the ''Purgatory Age, where we're going to have to atone for our sins a bit.'' 
 When you get down to it, there are two big problems facing private equity. The first has to do with economics; the second has to do with perception. 
 The economic problem is easy to understand: the good times for private equity are over, at least for now. Deals have dried up. A number of big deals have been busted up after the fact, in ways that make the private equity guys look as though they are searching for loopholes to renege. And because deals were made at the peak of the private equity bubble on terms that no longer make sense, private equity returns are inevitably going to suffer. 
 ''If we make too much money, we're roasted for stealing companies from the public,'' Mr. Rubenstein said during a panel discussion. ''If we don't make enough money, people say we aren't as good as we say we are.''
 That comment speaks to the second problem facing private equity: the perception that it enriches itself at the expense a larger society. Private equity managers can talk all they want about that -- they make companies more efficient, and therefore more competitive -- but most people don't believe it. 
 Even the industry's biggest beneficiaries -- the pension funds that invest in private equity -- have been unwilling to speak in their favor. And the industry itself has done a poor job making its case, even though the statistic, at least over the long term, support their case. 
 Carlyle itself is a case in point. For years, its secrecy and political connections made it fodder for conspiracy theorists. More recently, the company had taken a different tack, opening up and using Mr. Rubenstein's charm and wit to deflect critics.
 To his credit, Mr. Rubenstein understands the problem. For years, he said, private equity firms concerned themselves only with their investors -- who cared mainly about how much money they were making on their investment. ''Virtually no investor has ever asked me what type of community support we've given from our various companies in our portfolio,'' he said.
 But that is precisely the kind of question that the public has. The question of what value private equity adds to society is one the industry has never adequately answered, though it appears to be taking aggressive steps in the right direction.
 The Private Equity Council, the industry's lobbying group, published a study recently suggesting that companies that have undergone buyouts created 8.4 percent more jobs than their peers. The World Economic Forum, meantime, published its own study about private equity's impact on society that was so muddied that it was difficult to make sense of it. 
 There was an undeniable schadenfreude at Davos over the prospect of private equity unable to make new deals, thanks to the credit crisis, or even seeing companies that had recently been taken private having to file for bankruptcy.
 Mr. Rubenstein was more sanguine about the economic difficulties than about its perception. ''No one should be shedding tears for the private equity industry,'' he said. ''We will have a somewhat greater default rate but not nearly as high as last time in the late 1980s and 1990s. Now the funds are so large that if more equity needs to be put in to shore up the balance sheet they really have the resources.'' 
 Then there is the greatest oddity of all -- the prospect of private equity firms having to do to themselves what they have done so often to the companies they buy -- downsize. At a dinner Thursday night attended by private equity kings like Stephen G. Pagliuca of Bain Capital and Scott Sperling of Thomas H. Lee Partners, executives talked about how during 2000 and 2001, several firms did not make a single acquisition, despite carrying a large number of employees.
 But not everyone is so sanguine. ''We've taken on a big number of bodies that need to be fed,'' said Joseph L. Rice III, the co-founder and chairman of Clayton, Dubilier & Rice. If the market continue to be choppy, ''we might have to do what investment banks have done,'' he said, alluding to layoffs, without ever using the word.

HEADLINE: Higher Costs May Curtail M.T.A. Work

BYLINE: By WILLIAM NEUMAN

 BODY:
Soaring construction costs could force the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to scrap plans for an architecturally ambitious glass-domed subway station in Lower Manhattan and lead to more than $1 billion in cost overruns for the authority's major expansion projects, officials said Monday.
 The rising costs could slow progress on the three so-called mega-projects needed to expand the capacity of the public transportation system, including a Long Island Rail Road link to Grand Central Terminal, a westward extension of the No. 7 subway line and the first leg of the Second Avenue subway. 
 The news represents another setback for the subway station project, known as the Fulton Street Transit Center, which was envisioned as a central element in the recovery of Lower Manhattan after the terror attack of Sept. 11, 2001. 
 ''We're just in the middle of a construction inflation crisis,'' said H. Dale Hemmerdinger, the authority's chairman. ''And from our point of view as an agency that spends an awful lot of money, this is not good news.''
 Elliot G. Sander, the authority's executive director, ordered an immediate review of the budgets for the three mega-projects. The review will identify areas where costs can be cut and the projects scaled back, although he said that he hoped to keep cutbacks to areas that would not directly affect riders. 
 A ''back of the envelope'' calculation, Mr. Sander said, suggested that together the three mega-projects could see ''$1 billion or more in additional costs.'' The combined budgets for the three projects total $12.5 billion. 
 The problems were underscored Monday, during a round of authority board committee meetings, by the decision to drastically scale back plans for the Fulton Street Transit Center, a project to modernize and unravel a spaghetti bowl of interlinked subway stations in the vicinity of Broadway and Fulton Street. 
 Financed partly by federal funds earmarked for the post-Sept. 11 recovery of Lower Manhattan, the transit center was to be topped by an eye-grabbing glass and steel domelike structure called an oculus, which would direct natural light into the underground. 
 The center was also seen as the transportation authority's answer to the even more ambitious and costly PATH terminal designed by the architect Santiago Calatrava for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, a block to the west at ground zero. (Cost estimates there have also risen, to as much as $3.4 billion from an initial budget of $2.2 billion.)
 Several underground portions of the Fulton Street subway project have been completed or are close to being finished, including a renovation of the platform and mezzanine serving the Nos. 2 and 3 trains. 
 The authority planned to finish the project by letting out a contract to cover the construction of the entrance building and oculus and several remaining pieces of the underground work. 
 But the authority received only one bid, of $870 million, far exceeding the $370 million the authority had budgeted for the contract.
 Mysore L. Nagaraja, the authority's president of capital construction, said the authority rejected the bid and would now split the project into smaller pieces, in the hope of attracting more bidders and greater competition. 
 He said the underground portions of the work could be completed by late 2009, which will make the connections between subway lines fully functional for riders. 
 But officials said that it was unclear now what would go on top. 
 ''I'm sad to say that we cannot build the transit center as currently envisioned in this market with the budget that we have,'' Mr. Sander said. 
 As it is, even without a station building, the project will reach a total cost of about $930 million, which is nearly $30 million more than the authority has in its overall budget for the project. 
 It is not the first time the project has run into budget trouble. The cost of acquiring real estate to make way for the project rose to $157 million from an early estimate of $50 million. 
 The authority has already razed several buildings at Fulton and Broadway to make way for the project, and Monday's developments raised the prospect of the site's remaining virtually vacant above ground for an extended time, or of a much more modest entrance building. 
 ''Fulton and Broadway are the crossroads of downtown, and the transit hub as imagined was going to give Lower Manhattan something that it hasn't had, which is a visible transportation hub,'' said Elizabeth H. Berger, president of the Alliance for Downtown New York, a business group. 
 ''It's at the center of our future, and the project has to get back on track.''
 Mr. Hemmerdinger said that the rise in construction costs was being felt across the country in both the public and private sectors and that it was driven by a steep increase in the cost of basic materials, including steel and concrete. 
 Mr. Sander said that if the financial problems on the projects get worse, they could cause delays. 
 ''We don't want to repeat the mistake that we made on Second Avenue, for example, where we completely stopped the project in the '70s,'' he said. ''I think what happens if we were to have a real financial cataclysm, which I don't think we're facing now, what you would probably do is slow the pace of the projects down. I don't think we're talking about doing that in any kind of dramatic way.''

HEADLINE: He's Seen the Enemy, And It's Here at Home

BYLINE: By CHARLES ISHERWOOD

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN 

 BODY:
With the dollar plummeting in world markets, a recession looming and America-bashing on the rise abroad, the time is ripe for plays discussing the sick soul of the country and offering prescriptions for its cure. One of the first out of the gate is ''The Evildoers'' by David Adjmi, having its world premiere at the Yale Repertory Theater here in a slick, hard-charging production directed by Rebecca Bayla Taichman.
 Mr. Adjmi, an emerging writer who will follow ''The Evildoers'' with another new play in the spring at the Woolly Mammoth Theater in Washington, takes the microcosmic approach by focusing on a pair of troubled marriages. Bad marriages have long made for good theater, heaven knows, and ''The Evildoers'' contains several lively patches of slashingly funny dialogue. 
 But as the play progresses, its mixture of high ambitions and lurid details begins to curdle. The title is presumably an ironic reference to George W. Bush's famous use of this King Jamesian term for bad guys. In Mr. Adjmi's contrasting view, the bad guys are not out there but right here at home. He clearly believes that American society is suffering -- to use a term that crops up frequently -- a loss of spiritual health, a proposition many might agree with. But his quasi-apocalyptic, quasi-mystical and wholly grotesque analysis of the national malaise lacks both subtlety and sense.
 The opening scene, set in a swanky Manhattan restaurant with apparently deplorable service, rings with echoes of Edward Albee's ''Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'' Stephen Barker Turner and Johanna Day play George and Martha to Matt McGrath's Nick and Samantha Soule's Honey, although in Mr. Adjmi's rewrite it will be the apparently mild-mannered Nick figure, Mr. McGrath's Martin, who dedicates himself to the destruction of comforting illusions.
 Jerry (Mr. Turner), a therapist, is deep in his cups and waxing philosophic. ''People aren't authentic, that's the problem, you know,'' he says. ''And, er, you know they're all circling this -- terrible abyss of pain. And it's our job to get inside of that, you see? I mean, if we can't enter people's suffering, then we suffer.''
 His acidulous wife, Carol (Ms. Day), calls repeatedly for the check, to no purpose, in between nasty cracks at Martin's mousy wife, Judy (Ms. Soule), and morsels of tart commentary about the disintegrating culture. 
 ''I mean, yes, we're sinking,'' she coolly opines, ''but the sinking can go on for eons and nothing changes.'' 
 But Martin is apparently stung by both Jerry's insight and by Carol's cynicism about, among other things, the institution of marriage. (One of Mr. Adjmi's brightest punch lines is the revelation of her vocation.) He ends the evening by threatening to confiscate Carol's wedding ring and then by excoriating his cowering wife with a reference to a previous oyster metaphor: 
 ''I was promised a pearl and I got grit; now it's time for the shucking.''
 Flaying would perhaps be a more apposite term. And Martin, on a quest for emotional truth, will not stop at abandoning his own marriage but insists on awakening his friends to the rot at the heart of theirs.
 The rending of the veils of delusion that shroud abysses of unhappiness is a durable enough theme, but Mr. Adjmi's elucidation of it in ''The Evildoers'' never accrues much credibility, either emotional or literal. Martin's instantaneous discovery of his homosexuality -- via a late-night encounter on the subway that leads to a few days of bliss with a married architect -- feels contrived and strangely retrograde. (It is a little late in the day to be using this device as a major mode of self-revelation.) 
 And Martin's attempts to seduce his friend come across as lunatic, unless he believes that in grabbing Jerry's crotch he is inflicting on him the suffering that the men seem to believe offers the path to spiritual redemption.
 I'm afraid Martin is meant to be some sort of holy madman who must destroy in order to save. He and Jerry engage in long discussions of biblical texts, focusing on the purpose of pain and how one best loves one's enemy, and for that matter one's country. 
 ''If you really embrace your country Carol you'd see that it has to break before it moves forward,'' Martin says ominously. The atmosphere of portent only thickens in the play's last scene, which finds a shattered Jerry hunkered down over a hand-held video game as the apocalypse appears to hit the island of Manhattan. 
 With a sleek set by Riccardo Hernandez and stylish costumes by Susan Hilferty, the production is first-class. The actors all give vivid performances. Ms. Day, however, is perhaps a little too vivid. Carol is so cuttingly abrasive that her awful comeuppance -- one of the more gruesome acts of violence I've seen simulated on a stage -- almost comes as a relief.
 Mr. Adjmi is certainly skilled at writing dialogue that both captures and softly lampoons the fluid eloquence and showy wit that perfumes the air at Manhattan restaurants and dining rooms. Seasoning his writing with clever, high-toned references to Franz Kline and Gibbon and much else, he seeks to drive home the point that the country's privileged classes have been chattering away about thread counts while Rome burns. But the flashy dialogue and fashionably violent imagery can't mask the play's fundamental flaw. It suffers from the very fault it condemns: it's inauthentic.

HEADLINE: Aide Linked to Detroit Mayor Will Step Down

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
The chief of staff for Detroit's mayor resigned on Monday, five days after the release of text messages indicating that she and the mayor had lied under oath when they denied having had an extramarital affair. 
 In a letter to Mayor Kwame M. Kilpatrick, with whom she has been friends since high school, Christine L. Beatty said that she ''can no longer effectively carry out the duties of chief of staff'' and that her resignation would be effective Feb. 8.
 ''I painfully regret the devastation that the recent reports have caused to the citizens of Detroit, to my co-workers, to the mayor's family and to my family and friends,'' said Ms. Beatty, who was married when the affair appeared to have taken place but divorced in 2006. Mr. Kilpatrick has not signaled any intent to resign, despite demands last week that he do so by a union representing 900 city workers.
 Mr. Kilpatrick's spokesman, James Canning, would not comment on Ms. Beatty's resignation and said the mayor had no public appearances scheduled Monday.
 Ms. Beatty was a legislative aide to Mr. Kilpatrick when he was a state representative. She ran his successful mayoral campaign in 2001 and has been his chief of staff for his entire tenure as mayor. 
 Last Wednesday, The Detroit Free Press published transcripts of text messages between the mayor and Ms. Beatty from 2002 to 2003, Mr. Kilpatrick's first year at City Hall, indicating that the two had an intimate relationship. The newspaper said some messages indicate that Mr. Kilpatrick and Ms. Beatty may have used city money to pay for out-of-town trysts.
 Mr. Kilpatrick's only response has been a brief statement released by his office in which he described the text messages as ''embarrassing'' and said he and his wife, Carlita, ''worked our way through these intensely personal issues years ago.''
 Mr. Kilpatrick, his wife and their children were seen on Sunday returning to their city-owned residence. His deputy has been handling city business.
 The Wayne County prosecutor, Kym L. Worthy, said on Friday that she would investigate whether Mr. Kilpatrick and Ms. Beatty committed perjury when they testified in a police whistle-blower lawsuit last year that they had never had an intimate relationship. A conviction on felony perjury charges can result in a 15-year prison sentence.
 Lawsuits filed by three former police officers who claim they were fired for trying to investigate the mayor's security detail have cost Detroit, whose declining population and poor economy have devastated its finances, more than $9 million.

HEADLINE: McDonald's Posts Profit but Issues Warning

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: CHICAGO 

 BODY:
McDonald's reported a fourth-quarter profit of $1.27 billion on Monday, but warned that sales at restaurants open at least a year were flat last month. 
 The shares fell $3.03, to $51.07.
 In its comments, McDonald's cited severe winter weather as the primary reason for the weakness in American sales, which were more than offset by international sales gains.
 But the warning raised concerns about the impact of a possible recession, as investors focused on the slowing growth.
 ''Weak U.S. trends are likely to put some pressure on the stock until investors have a sense of whether December was a one-month outlier or a new trend,'' an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, Larry Miller, said in a note to investors.
 Net income for the fourth quarter was $1.06 a share, up from $1.24 billion, or $1 a share, in the period a year ago.
 Excluding income tax benefits of 33 cents a share, the company earned 73 cents a share, beating analysts' consensus estimate of 71 cents, according to a Thomson Financial poll.
 Revenue rose 6 percent, to $5.75 billion from $5.45 billion in the fourth quarter of 2006, also topping Wall Street's $5.61 billion estimate.
 Global same-store sales rose 6.7 percent for the quarter.
 Despite the December weakness, the chief executive, James A. Skinner, said the company remained confident in its American business -- its biggest market with close to 14,000 restaurants. 
 For the full year, McDonald's profit fell 32 percent to $2.4 billion, or $1.98 a share, from $3.5 billion, or $2.83 a share, a year earlier.
 Revenue climbed 9 percent, to $22.8 billion from $20.9 billion.

PERSON: Charles F. Luce 

HEADLINE: Charles F. Luce, 90, Ex-Chief of Con Ed

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
Charles F. Luce, the chairman and chief executive of Consolidated Edison, the giant New York electric and gas utility during some of its most difficult times, died Saturday in Torrance, Calif. He was 90 and lived in Bronxville, N.Y.
 The cause was prostate cancer, said Joyce Hergenhan, a former company spokeswoman. 
 Mr. Luce headed Con Ed from 1967 to 1982 and dealt with the oil crisis of the 1970s, customer rage over rising rates, the 1977 blackout that paralyzed New York City and the settlement of a decades-long struggle with environmental groups over construction of a power plant at Storm King Mountain on the Hudson River.
 A liberal Democrat and an environmentalist, Mr. Luce did not fit the standard profile of the big-business executive when he agreed to leave his post as under secretary of the interior in the Johnson administration to take over Consolidated Edison.
 ''The metropolitan area's need for electric energy doubles about every 15 years,'' Mr. Luce said then. ''To supply these vast new quantities of energy at reasonable cost, but protect the city's environment from pollution and unsightly structures, is a king-size job.'' 
 It became particularly difficult in 1973, when fuel prices skyrocketed because of the Arab oil embargo, and Con Ed's rates followed. 
 Facing customer protests, Mr. Luce chose to soften the monthly billing blow by eliminating the company's April 1974 dividend. That prompted shareholder protests, and on May 24, 1974, Mr. Luce presided over a meeting at the old Commodore Hotel on 42nd Street at which customers and shareholders boisterously expressed their views.
 A New York Times headline the next day said, ''Days of Anxiety for the Man Who Saved a Watt.'' 
 That was a reference to the ''Save-a-Watt'' program, which Mr. Luce had instituted soon after taking over as Con Ed chairman. It was a shift from the electricity industry's traditional marketing strategy, succinctly expressed as ''Live better electrically.''
 For 25 hours, starting on the evening of July 13, 1977, New York City could not live electrically at all. Two lightning strikes on major tie-lines in Westchester County led to the collapse of the entire system. 
 Some Con Ed officials attributed the blackout to ''an act of God.'' Although Mr. Luce did not utter the phrase himself, he became associated with it. 
 He kept cool in the face of Mayor Abraham D. Beame's accusations of ''gross negligence'' on the part of the company, saying, ''Respectfully, I think he's wrong,'' and calling for a fair review. 
 In the end, Con Ed had to concede that the systemwide expansion of the power failure after the local lightning strikes was largely its fault. 
 Four years before Mr. Luce became chairman, Con Ed had started seeking approval from regulators to build a hydroelectric plant on Storm King Mountain in Orange County, 55 miles north of New York City. Opposition to that plan and to proposals for other power plants along the Hudson River was fierce and unrelenting for nearly 20 years. 
 Then, in December 1980, 11 environmental groups, Con Ed and other utility companies reached what became known as the Hudson River Peace Treaty. Mr. Luce had asked Russell E. Train, a former head of the Environmental Protection Agency, to mediate the dispute.
 Under the agreement, Con Ed abandoned efforts to build the Storm King plant. In return, the environmental groups and the federal Environmental Protection Agency dropped their demands that Con Ed build six costly cooling towers to protect fish from being sucked into power plants at Indian Point and several other sites along the river. The agreement was widely cited as a model for balancing economic and environmental needs.
 Charles Franklin Luce was born on Aug. 12, 1917, in Platteville, Wis., a son of James and Wilma Luce. His father owned a furniture store and a mortuary. 
 As a teenager, Mr. Luce got some early exposure to the utility business as a meter reader for the local power company. 
 Mr. Luce earned a bachelor's degree and a law degree through a five-year program at the University of Wisconsin in 1941, then received a master's degree in law at Yale in 1942. 
 Unable to enlist for military service in World War II because of an attack of polio, Mr. Luce became a staff lawyer for the Board of Economic Warfare in Washington. 
 A year later, on the recommendation of a professor at Yale, he was chosen as a law clerk to Justice Hugo L. Black of the Supreme Court.
 For 15 years after World War II, Mr. Luce practiced law in Walla Walla, Wash. 
 Then, in 1961, President Kennedy chose him to head the Bonneville Power Administration, which markets power from the Grand Coulee Dam and more than 20 other federal hydroelectric plants in the Columbia River Basin. 
 Mr. Luce also worked with Interior Secretary Stewart L. Udall in creating the Pacific Northwest-Pacific Southwest Intertie, a vast power transmission complex. He negotiated a 1964 treaty with Canada for joint hydroelectric development of the Columbia River. 
 At Mr. Udall's request, President Johnson appointed Mr. Luce as under secretary of the Interior in September 1966. But within six months, Con Ed officials -- spurred by a Fortune magazine headline, ''The Company You Love to Hate'' -- asked Mr. Luce to take control of the company.
 Mr. Luce's first wife, Helen Oden, died in 2001. He is survived by his second wife, the former Margaret Richmond; two sons, James, of Vancouver, Wash., and Charles Jr., of Boulder, Colo.; two daughters, Christina Gordon of Mansfield Center, Conn., and Barbara Luce of Portland, Conn.; and eight grandchildren.
 Mr. Luce was an avid biker. As Con Ed chairman, he would regularly pedal around Manhattan on a three-speed bike, wearing a meter-reader's cap, inspecting company work crews and peeking into open manholes.

HEADLINE: Tool Makers Offer Dim Forecasts

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Two tool makers, the Black & Decker Corporation and Stanley Works, offered dim forecasts for 2008 on Monday as a slowdown in the housing market has stifled demand for building equipment. 
 Black & Decker, which makes DeWalt power tools and Price Pfister faucets, offered a first-quarter profit outlook that was lower than Wall Street forecasts, and Stanley Works cited a ''possible mild and short-lived U.S. recession,'' for its full-year sales growth forecast of flat to up 1 percent.
 Black & Decker forecast earnings of $1.10 to $1.20 a share for the first quarter, while analysts surveyed by Reuters Estimates, on average, were expecting $1.40.
 ''We recognize that the U.S. economy is slowing, and we do not expect a housing recovery in 2008,'' the chief executive, Nolan D. Archibald, said in a statement. 
 The company reported a fourth-quarter profit of $187.4 million, or $2.94 a share, up from $95.7 million, or $1.38 a share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, however, profit fell to $1.06 a share from $1.38. The analysts' average forecast was $1.03, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales rose 3 percent, to $1.7 billion.
 An analyst at the investment firm Sterne, Agee & Leach, Nicholas P. Heymann, said investors were concerned about the home remodeling outlook. When the economy slows, remodeling picks up as people renovate their homes rather than build new ones, he said. But the credit squeeze is making it more difficult for homeowners to get loans, even for remodeling projects.

HEADLINE: California Senate Panel Rejects Health Coverage Proposal

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY and KEVIN SACK; Jesse McKinley reported from San Francisco, and Kevin Sack from Atlanta.

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
In a blow to universal health care coverage in California and possibly to its prospects nationwide, a State Senate committee on Monday rejected a sweeping plan by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger that would have offered insurance to millions of uninsured residents. 
 The Senate Health Committee defeated the plan 7 to 1, with three abstentions, as Democrats and Republicans alike said they found it too nebulous and potentially too costly for a state facing a $14.5 billion deficit. 
 ''This bill is not only not perfect, it is flawed,'' said State Senator Sheila James Kuehl, Democrat of Los Angeles and chairwoman of the committee, who voted against it. 
 Mr. Schwarzenegger, who had seemed resigned to the plan's defeat in recent days, sounded a determined note on what he had viewed as a major policy initiative of his second term.
 ''I am someone who does not give up, especially when there is a problem as big and as serious as health care that needs to be fixed,'' Mr. Schwarzenegger, a Republican, said. ''One setback is just that -- a setback.''
 The loss in California, the nation's most populous state and often its most influential, bodes poorly for universal health coverage, an issue that just a year ago appeared to have found its moment. Besides Mr. Schwarzenegger, the governors of two other populous states, Pennsylvania and Illinois, proposed ambitious health care plans in 2007. But in the end, nothing of national significance was passed. 
 Drew E. Altman, president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, which studies health policy, said the vote in California reinforced the need for action in Washington. 
 ''California's failure, after coming so close, underscores the lesson that too many states don't have the political will or resources to reform health care on their own,'' Mr. Altman said. ''Thus the need for a national solution.''
 Mr. Schwarzenegger's proposal was modeled largely on a Massachusetts plan, which requires individuals to have insurance, prohibits insurers from denying coverage on the basis of age or health, and uses government subsidies to make insurance affordable for low-income workers. 
 But last Wednesday, as the California Senate committee heard testimony on the bill, Massachusetts announced that spending on its health care plan would increase by $400 million in 2008, a cost expected to be borne largely by taxpayers. 
 Shortly after the vote, Assemblyman Michael N. Villines of Fresno, the chamber's Republican leader, praised it as a rejection of ''a massive government-run health care scheme.'' 
 On the Democratic side, there were concerns about the so-called ''individual mandate,'' which would have required all Californians to carry and pay for insurance, except those in economic hardship. 
 The vote comes as Mr. Schwarzenegger faces a dire financial situation and has proposed a spending cut of 10 percent for most state agencies.
 Jonathan Gruber, a health economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who was commissioned to advise Mr. Schwarzenegger and the Legislature on the health proposal, said it ''was pretty clearly doomed by the larger fiscal deficit.'' 
 How the California vote affects the issue's national profile remains to be seen. A New York Times/CBS News poll taken this month showed that 7 percent of those questioned thought health care was the country's most pressing problem. Over all, it ranked third after the economy and the war in Iraq.
 The California bill looked to have a chance when it passed the Assembly in December. But it faltered badly in the Senate, particularly after a report from the state legislative analyst last Tuesday raised questions about its long-term financing. 
 Senator Darrell Steinberg, Democrat of Sacramento, was one of several to express frustration that the Legislature had failed to draft a passable bill.
 ''When this bill fails,'' said Mr. Steinberg, who abstained, ''what's next?''

HEADLINE: Uncommon Wealth Of Success in Boston For Big Three Teams

BYLINE: By ALAN SCHWARZ

DATELINE: BOSTON 

 BODY:
For a city with an inveterate inferiority complex, Boston has been feeling awfully superior lately.
 The Red Sox just won a second World Series in four years after an 86-season drought that traumatized generations of New Englanders. The Patriots, already winners of three Super Bowls this decade, are storming into Sunday's game an unprecedented 18-0. And the Celtics, only months after being accused of trying to finish with the N.B.A.'s worst record, have the league's top mark at 34-8.
 All this winning raises the question: what has Boston lost? If not games -- since Oct. 16, those three New England teams have won 87 percent of the time -- then perhaps a certain identity the region must now reconsider. Wearing a Red Sox cap or a Patriots jersey no longer identifies citizens as connoisseurs of pain, lovable Charlie Browns to New York's success-swiping Lucy. Boston's little garage bands have made it big, and the victory parades are crowded with bandwagons. 
 ''There's an embarrassment of riches, all these championships; we're terribly spoiled,'' said Chris Greeley, a government-affairs consultant in Boston and who was once a former chief of staff for Senator John Kerry. ''Being the underdog was something Boston always liked. It was easier, and it was good for banding together. But now we don't have a great enemy to point to -- New York, we've become them.''
 Marty Meehan, the chancellor of the University of Massachusetts Lowell who was a former United States Congressman, added: ''I have an 8-year-old and a 5-year-old. I wonder if they're ever going to know what it was really like here for all those decades.''
 No city, let alone Boston, has ever fielded a threesome in the most popular national team sports as dominant as the current Patriots, Red Sox and Celtics. The closest -- fittingly -- was New York from 1969 through 1970, when the Jets won Super Bowl III, the Mets won the 1969 World Series and the Knicks won the 1970 basketball title. But New York had multiple baseball and football teams, which Boston does not. That inspired Carl Morris, a statistics professor across the Charles River at Harvard, to calculate the chances of a monofranchised city having the three best teams in one year: about 1 in 29,000.
 ''I'm not sure if people here realize how unlikely this thing really is,'' Morris said. ''No city is ever going to see anything like this again.''
 New York celebrated its 1969-70 sports success with a decade of bankruptcy and rampant crime; Boston's future appears rosier. Paul Guzzi, president of the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce, described the economic impact of the region's sports success as modest, citing added tourism and spending during World Series games, and impact of the Patriots' new stadium/mall complex in Foxborough.
 Terry Francona, the Red Sox manager for both recent World Series titles, said the benefits of winning were probably more spiritual. Francona grew up outside Pittsburgh in the 1970s, and watched the Steelers and the Pirates win championships in 1979.
 ''The steel mills were shutting down, and Pittsburgh was going to have to change its identity,'' Francona recalled. ''People were walking around town wearing the black and gold with pride. Winning made people feel better about themselves.''
 If Bostonians are feeling sunnier, they do not always show it at the Harp, a watering hole down the street from the TD Banknorth Garden. Katie McAuliffe has tended bar there for six years and she laughed as she considered the difference in fan outlook. ''They're a lot more bold than they used to be,'' she said. ''They like to break things more now. I think it's pent-up frustration -- like they don't know how to handle this.''
 Indeed, success can demand some emotional recalibration. Sports columnists for The Boston Globe, who for decades could charitably be described as dyspeptic, now must scrounge for material. And even Champagne loses its allure in six-packs.
 ''When the Red Sox finally won in 2004, the city just went bananas; it was the greatest bachelor party ever,'' said Mark Sternman, a researcher for a state government agency, adding that, ''2007 was the best party you could have as a married man.''
 The Celtics, of course, spent the 1960s as one of sport's great dynasties, and became dreadful only recently. (Last spring, the team was accused of losing games on purpose so it could finish with the N.B.A.'s worst record and increase its chances of landing the No. 1 or 2 pick in the draft. The Celtics botched that, too.) The Red Sox have been traditionally competitive, just not good enough to outlast the hated Yankees.
 The Patriots' history has been the most pathetic. Beyond frequent 3-13 seasons, their first true home, Schaefer Stadium, opened in 1971 with massive toilet overflows and barely improved thereafter.
 Meehan has been a fan through it all. He has held season tickets since 1984, and he said that winning had changed the Patriots fans' experience. ''There are times when you want fans to get up and remind the team that this is a home game,'' he said.
 Greeley said that Boston fans today expect more of their teams but less of their players. His father once caught a foul ball off the bat of Ted Williams, but threw it back because he, and most of New England, disapproved of Williams's sulking and apparent selfishness. Fast-forward to today, when the slugger Manny Ramirez is generally shaky on the field and quite flighty off it, but is beloved for this (and his .300 average).
 ''Manny would never have gotten away with being Manny 40 years ago,'' Greeley said. ''Nowadays there's such emphasis on performance. There's a whole generation that's growing up now with so much focus on the winning that they may never appreciate the play and the artistry itself. They're not being trained to appreciate it.''
 At Sully's Tap, not far from the Harp, Jon Megas-Russell did not agree as he nursed a beer at the weathered counter. A devout Boston sports fan and Celtics season-ticket holder, he said that old, rumpled Fenway Park was better than ever thanks to recent renovations (although some complain that rampant advertising has left the Green Monster looking like a Nascar entry). Also worth it, he said, was having to coexist with frivolous front-runners who jump in the marathon only at the end.
 ''You don't lose anything by winning, you only add on,'' said Megas-Russell, 25, a sales manager from suburban Somerville. ''When they win, it validates what you've been doing. It puts the city in the limelight in America. People look at the Pilgrims, but we've been in the back seat to New York, Los Angeles, Chicago. This brings us back.''
 He added: ''A true fan takes it when it's good and takes it when it's bad. When Tom Brady retires, the Patriots won't be as good. You have to live in the moment.''
 Boston's moments, for most of the last century, ended in heartbreak -- none more poignant than Bill Buckner's grounder between the legs against the Mets in 1986. The New Yorker writer Roger Angell encapsulated New England's perpetual and divine grief in a palindrome: ''Not so, Boston.''
 Yet as the Patriots enter Sunday's Super Bowl as heavy favorites -- over the New York Giants, naturally -- to win the city's sixth championship in seven years, ''Not so, Boston'' seems as outdated as those Pilgrims. Backward is forward, and Boston is first.

CORRECTION-DATE: February 5, 2008

 CORRECTION:
A sports article last Tuesday about the current dominance of Boston's professional football, basketball and baseball teams misstated the chances of any city with only one franchise in each of those sports winning championships in the same season. It is 1 in 2,000, not 1 in 29,000.

HEADLINE: Spitzer Reneged on Aid To City, Bloomberg Says

BYLINE: By TRYMAINE LEE

DATELINE: ALBANY 

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said on Monday that the Spitzer administration was shortchanging New York City by about $500 million, and he urged lawmakers to restore the money, especially in education and health care. 
 During pointed testimony at a joint legislative budget hearing, the mayor said the school aid that Gov. Eliot Spitzer proposed to give the city in the next fiscal year was significantly less than had been promised. Mr. Bloomberg said the reductions could force the city to further squeeze taxpayers and deepen cuts in programs. 
 ''A deal is a deal,'' the mayor said. 
 ''This year, as we do every year, we've made budget decisions in the city based on the expectation, and even the expressed assurances, that Albany will honor its commitments to us,'' he added. 
 Mr. Bloomberg praised the governor personally but spent much of his testimony criticizing Mr. Spitzer's $124 billion proposed budget. 
 Although the overall amount of state subsidies to the city would increase, the mayor said the city expected more, not only for education but also in the unrestricted aid that the state provides. Mr. Bloomberg said the governor was backing off an agreement reached in budget negotiations last spring to fully restore $330 million in unrestricted aid. 
 ''Now it's a year later and we find that instead of this promised full share, we're budgeted to receive only half of what were due.'' he said. ''Well, New York City doesn't need another I.O.U.''
 The mayor appeared to take a jab at the governor's recent call for a bailout of the lagging upstate economy, saying, ''We see no need to pit downstate against upstate, or to shortchange one area of New York while subsidizing others.''
 In comments after his testimony, Mr. Bloomberg also criticized one of the signature ideas presented in the governor's budget: Mr. Spitzer's plan to explore imposing a ceiling on increases in local property taxes. Outside the city, property taxes are the principal means of financing education. The mayor said a property tax cap ''takes away democracy'' and would shift more of the burden of rising education costs statewide to the taxpayers of New York City, who are already responsible for half of the state's revenue but make up only 40 percent of the population. 
 He did praise several of the governor's proposals, including a restructuring of the way that Medicaid reimburses hospitals for various types of care, and a planned expansion of the state's Child Health Plus, a publicly financed insurance program.
 Mr. Bloomberg called the governor ''an honest guy trying to do his best with limited resources.''
 ''These aren't personal things,'' the mayor said. ''The governor, I've known for a long time. He's trying to do the right thing. I think he would say the same thing about the mayor.''
 Mr. Bloomberg's message was mainly one of frustration. He said that under the budget that the governor proposed last week, the city would be expected to absorb millions of dollars in new special education costs for 29,000 kindergartners. And while most local governments would have their financial responsibility on special education capped, New York City would not, which would result in $10 million a year in additional costs, he said. 
 The mayor's testimony began several weeks of legislative hearings on the governor's budget proposal. 
 The Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, a Republican who has been the mayor's most important ally in the Legislature, said on Monday, ''I didn't hear what he testified about, but naturally he's not happy because they cut revenue sharing to the city, and I think that probably impacts him several hundred million dollars.''
 Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat who has long had a contentious relationship with the mayor, called Mr. Bloomberg's testimony ''divisive'' and noted that the city would receive an increase in school aid under the Spitzer budget. 
 ''We are one state and we are one city,'' Mr. Silver said. ''That's it. You don't divide it up that 'More comes from here, more comes from there.' ''
 In a statement released by the governor's office after Mr. Bloomberg's testimony, Mr. Spitzer said that ''the economic storm clouds that hang over our nation and this state call for hard choices and shared sacrifice.'' 
 He also said that in his proposed budget, New York City would receive a net increase of $1.2 billion over last year in school aid, property tax relief and Medicaid savings.

HEADLINE: Out of Hardship, a Hunger for Success

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY

DATELINE: MELBOURNE, Australia 

 BODY:
It was the morning after at Melbourne Park. The players' lounge was empty of players. Men and machinery made loud noises as Rod Laver Arena began its transformation from the epicenter of tennis into a concert hall that will soon provide a stage for Hilary Duff and Iron Maiden.
 But for a few hours more, Novak Djokovic was still at the scene of his greatest tennis triumph. After a night of minimal sleep and maximum satisfaction, Djokovic, the new Australian Open champion, sat at a massive, polished table in the offices of Tennis Australia and explained what he had in common with the other 20-year-old who won a Grand Slam singles title here this year: Maria Sharapova.
 ''She is mentally very strong and is a very strong personality,'' Djokovic said. ''She doesn't allow anybody to fool with her, and she shows it every time on the court. She already has three Grand Slams. That proves everything. We are kind of on the same line in life. We've been through difficult things in our career, and we appreciate success much more, even though we are still young.'' 
 It has been possible of late for tennis observers to think less about hunger, one of the traditional engines of success. Roger Federer comes from a comfortable background in Switzerland, Rafael Nadal from an affluent family in Majorca. Justine Henin and the Williams sisters, who emerged from modest beginnings, have been multimillionaires for years.
 But this year's first major tournament was a reminder that the desire born of economic hardship and cultural upheaval is a powerful motor for an athlete. For the first time at a Grand Slam, all of the women's semifinalists represented Eastern European nations, with Sharapova from Russia, Ana Ivanovic and Jelena Jankovic from Serbia and Daniela Hantuchova from Slovakia. Djokovic's victory also made him the first Serbian man to win a major singles title.
 All four women and Djokovic had to leave their countries at early ages for extended periods for the sake of their tennis careers. Such sacrifices can clearly backfire. Sharapova's coach, Michael Joyce, said he sometimes joked with Sharapova's father, Yuri, that he had probably given false hope to many a tennis family. Yuri Sharapov left Russia for Florida with extremely limited means when his daughter was 7, and she eventually began training at the Bollettieri Tennis Academy.
 ''There's millions of people like him that don't have daughters that have that talent,'' Joyce said. ''So in their case it worked out, but I always tease him all the time. I go to Bollettieri's, and I'm like, 'You've probably ruined so many people's lives.' ''
 Djokovic, unable to find acceptable training conditions, left his parents and Serbia when he was 12 to board at the tennis academy run by the former Yugoslav star Niki Pilic in Munich.
 ''This is a professional sport and some have a more difficult way, some have an easier way,'' Djokovic said. ''It just depends where you grow up. It's a matter of luck in the end, but that's life. But probably this hunger for the success which we all have and still have, you can see it in the girls like Sharapova and the Williams sisters and the girls and guys from Serbia. 
 ''You see how much they appreciate to be in that position and how much energy and emotions they put on the court. It's quite amazing. I know for myself I play with a lot of emotions, positive emotions, negative emotions. But this is how I feel and how I am. I'm a guy with a lot of temperament, because I know how much it means to me to be in that position.''
 Djokovic said his parents, who operated a restaurant in the Serbian mountains, had to work long hours to make his career possible. 
 ''You can't imagine what they've been through,'' he said. ''When you turn around now and see what we have been through as a family, we had to go through a difficult way, maybe a tougher way than somebody else. But it made us stronger.''
 What is surprising about Sharapova, already one of the world's wealthiest and most visible women at 20, is that she still projects that ferocious desire with a racket in hand.
 ''The day she loses that is the day she should just hang them up, because that wins you lots of matches,'' Joyce said.
 Sharapova said she was more interested in its effect on herself than her adversaries. 
 ''I don't care if they think it's intimidating or not or whatever,'' she said. ''I try to take care of my own business out there, and that's the most important thing: the belief you have on the court. I believe I'm capable of playing great tennis.''
 Djokovic said Monday that he hoped to bring positive energy to tennis and to Serbia, which spent most of the 1990s as a pariah as Yugoslavia gradually and violently split into independent nations. 
 Back in Serbia, his victory sparked large public celebrations in Belgrade. ''Most of the time for the last 20 years, they've been showing Serbia in a bad way, giving a bad picture, saying a lot of bad things about the country,'' he said. ''And I think these kinds of things lift them up and bring back the smiles on their faces. Even though it's just a success in the sport, I think it means a lot to them.''
 His popularity in Serbia has made him feel better about his decision not to pursue playing for Britain. Preliminary contacts were made with British tennis officials in 2006, but Djokovic, who was concerned about optimizing his training and the difficulty of attracting sponsorship as a Serb, chose not to pursue the move further.
 ''That was the smartest option,'' he said. ''I had a lot of pressure in that time, and it was not a good period of the year to have so much pressure: pressure from media, pressure from everybody, even from the people back in my country thinking, Why should I go? 
 ''I just created more negative vibrations for no reason, but I never had professional conditions to succeed as a professional player in my country. So that's why there were options to go somewhere else and just try to help myself and my family so we can live better. But I think we made a great decision, and now I'm very happy that I decided this way.''

HEADLINE: ACRIMONY REIGNS IN G.O.P. ON EVE OF FLORIDA VOTE

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER and MICHAEL LUO; John M. Broder reported from Jacksonville, Orlando and Tampa. Michael Luo reported from West Palm Beach, Fort Myers and Orlando. Michael Cooper contributed reporting from Clearwater.

DATELINE: TAMPA, Fla. 

 BODY:
The Republican contest for Florida ended in acrimony on Monday as the two leading candidates traded attacks, aggressively courting voters across the Florida peninsula in a primary battle that could produce a clear front-runner for the party's presidential nomination before a virtual national primary next week.
 The sparring, between Mitt Romney and Senator John McCain of Arizona, came as polls showed the race a statistical tie between them, with Rudolph W. Giuliani and Mike Huckabee, former governor of Arkansas, lagging. 
 Mr. Giuliani, former New York mayor, pledged that he would participate in a Republican presidential debate in California on Wednesday regardless of where he finished in Tuesday's voting here. Still, if Florida is not his last stand, it remains the place where he has all but staked his campaign. And as the hours before voting waned, that campaign had none of the feel of imminent victory. Though his organization chartered a Boeing 727 for a day of barnstorming on the eve of the primary, none of the rallies at airports in Sanford, Clearwater, Fort Myers or Fort Lauderdale drew even 100 supporters. 
 Mr. Romney, former governor of Massachusetts, began attacking at dawn, accusing Mr. McCain of allying himself with liberal Democrats in the Senate and betraying conservative principles on legislation involving immigration, the environment and campaign finance. 
 ''If you want that kind of a liberal Democratic course as president, then you can vote for him,'' Mr. Romney said at a Texaco gas station in West Palm Beach at 6:30 a.m. ''But those three pieces of legislation, those aren't conservative. Those aren't Republican.''
 Mr. McCain volleyed back by describing Mr. Romney as a serial flip-flopper who had taken multiple positions on a variety of issues, including gay rights, global warming and immigration. ''People, just look at his record as governor,'' Mr. McCain said at a shipyard in Jacksonville. ''He has been entirely consistent. He has consistently taken two sides of every major issue, sometimes more than two.'' 
 Monday's charges ended a week of intense campaigning in which Mr. McCain focused on veterans, senior citizens and Cubans in Miami, and Mr. Romney on conservatives across the state. Mr. Huckabee, who has spent little time in Florida, concentrated on religious conservatives. Mr. Giuliani appealed to transplanted New Yorkers and voters attracted to his tough-on-terrorism message.
 The Democrats are also holding a primary here Tuesday. But no convention delegates are being awarded in that contest (and no Democratic candidates have campaigned for it), a result of the national party's penalizing the state for scheduling it earlier than party rules allowed.
 One wild card in the Republican primary is the hundreds of thousands of Floridians who have already cast their ballots in early voting, before the last-minute advertising blitzes by the two leaders and the weekend endorsements of Mr. McCain by two popular Republican elected officials, Senator Mel Martinez and Gov. Charlie Crist.
 For a time on Monday, Mr. Crist, a moderate elected in 2006 with Mr. McCain's endorsement, stood on a street corner in Tampa waving a McCain sign at passing drivers. He spoke at a McCain rally here in the evening.
 Mr. Romney's campaign has spent much time focusing on the so-called I-4 corridor, which stretches from Tampa to Orlando, as well as the Jacksonville area. Those two regions, his campaign believes, will account for more than half the Republican turnout.
 His Florida field staff, in the midst of an enormous get-out-the-vote operation, telephoned more than 100,000 voters in 30 counties over the weekend, according to Mandy Fletcher, his state director. Volunteers are going door to door in population centers around the state, including Tampa, Orlando, Jacksonville, Fort Myers, Palm Beach and Fort Lauderdale.
 Mr. Romney built a sophisticated grass-roots and fund-raising operation in the state over the last year, while Mr. McCain has had virtually no Florida infrastructure since his campaign stalled over the summer. The Romney campaign believes its investment could make the difference on Tuesday.
 Mr. McCain's aides said his campaign, too, was running last-minute phone banks and get-out-the-vote drives, but acknowledged that they were being heavily outspent by Mr. Romney.
 Both campaigns spent liberally on television and radio advertising and have been placing automated phone calls carrying negative messages about each other. Romney aides said on Monday that some of their candidate's Cuban-American supporters had received phone calls saying Mr. Romney favored normalized relations with Fidel Castro's Cuba, a blasphemy to most Cuban emigres. Mr. McCain's staff said it was not responsible for the calls.
 Florida may be Mr. Romney's last chance to stop Mr. McCain from being anointed the front-runner in the Republican field. Mr. Romney's advisers have been laying out certain strategies for the crush of states that vote on Feb. 5, depending on whether they win or lose. In the case of a loss, depending on how large the margin and how his rivals fare, Mr. Romney may have to fall back on something of a survival strategy, scooping up a few states he can capture with relatively small expenditure and hoping that Mr. McCain does not sweep everywhere else and lock up the nomination. 
 On the other hand, a victory by Mr. Romney in Florida would throw the race wide open, giving him much needed momentum and most likely an infusion of cash. 
 Until the last few days, Mr. Romney largely refrained from criticizing Mr. McCain in Florida. After vigorously going after Mr. Huckabee in Iowa and Mr. McCain in New Hampshire, only to come up short in the nominating contests there, Mr. Romney's campaign tried a different tack in Michigan. He began focusing more on the economy, pledging to use his business background to fight for jobs. He won Michigan by a comfortable margin.
 Then, with polls showing the race in Florida to be neck and neck, it was Mr. McCain who went on the offensive against Mr. Romney over the weekend, ending something of an unofficial truce that had helped produce a relatively gentle Republican debate last week in Boca Raton.
 Mr. McCain accused Mr. Romney of having called in the spring for a timetable for withdrawal from Iraq, likening him to the Democrats in his approach to the conflict.
 Mr. Romney denounced the charge as false, and his traveling press secretary, Eric Fehrnstrom, said Mr. McCain's accusation ''raises the ante'' and forced Mr. Romney to ''respond in kind.''

HEADLINE: Investing in America

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
On a quiet Wednesday morning last August, Senators Chris Dodd and Chuck Hagel held a news conference in Washington to discuss what they felt was a critical issue: the nation's deteriorating infrastructure.
 The press was not impressed. Only a handful of reporters showed up to listen to their contention that a real crisis was at hand. That evening, during rush hour, the Interstate 35W bridge over the Mississippi River in Minneapolis collapsed, plunging vehicles 60 feet into the river and killing 13 people.
 There is usually not much about infrastructure stories to turn readers or viewers on. But the catastrophe in New Orleans and the bridge collapse in Minneapolis are tragic evidence of the peril that goes hand in hand with neglect of the nation's roads, bridges, levees, transit systems, water treatment facilities and so on. 
 Just two weeks before the Minneapolis bridge collapse, an underground steam pipe in Midtown Manhattan exploded, sending a geyser of filth and asbestos-laden debris into the air. A woman fleeing the scene died of a heart attack, and the area suffered millions of dollars in economic damage.
 In South Carolina, where candidates of both parties competed in recent presidential primaries, there is a long stretch of grievously neglected rural schools that has been dubbed ''the corridor of shame.'' Some of the schools are more than a century old. Among the many problems are ancient plumbing, inadequate heating and sewage that backs up into classrooms, bringing in vermin and terrible odors.
 The country could do itself a favor by paying more attention to the efforts of Senator Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat who is chairman of the Banking Committee, and Senator Hagel, a Nebraska Republican. They have co-sponsored legislation that would create a national infrastructure bank to promote and help finance large-scale projects across the nation.
 Part of their mission is to generate a sense of urgency. In an interview yesterday, Senator Dodd told me: ''At a time when we're worried about rising unemployment rates and declining confidence in this country, infrastructure projects have the dual effect of putting people to work -- and usually at pretty good salaries and wages -- while also creating a sense of optimism, of investing in the future.''
 The country has been hit hard by lost jobs in manufacturing and construction. As government and political leaders are scrambling for ways to stimulate the economy in the current downturn, infrastructure improvements would seem to be a natural component of any effective recovery plan.
 ''In terms of stimulating the economy, there is nothing better than a job,'' said Senator Dodd.
 The need for investment on a large scale -- and for the long term -- is undeniable. According to the American Society of Civil Engineers, in a study that should have gotten much more attention when it was released in 2005, it would take more than a trillion and a half dollars over a five-year period to bring the U.S. infrastructure into reasonably decent shape.
 Will we wait until another New Orleans-style disaster occurs, or another heavily traveled bridge plunges into a river?
 As things stand now, the American infrastructure is incapable of meeting the competitive demands of the globalized 21st-century economy. Senator Hagel noted that ports are overwhelmed by the ever-expanding volume of international trade. Rail lines are overloaded. Highways are clogged.
 ''The basic infrastructure of a country will determine that country's future,'' he said, ''and we are far behind.''
 We appear to have forgotten the lessons of history. Time and again an economic boom has followed periods of sustained infrastructure improvement. It's impossible to calculate all of the benefits from (to mention just a few) the Erie Canal, which connected the Great Lakes to the Atlantic Ocean and helped make New York America's premier city; the rural electrification program and other capital improvements of the New Deal; the interstate highway program of the Eisenhower administration.
 The tremendous costs and vast reach of today's infrastructure requirements means that the federal government has to take a leadership role. It's inevitable. The only question is when.
 The financier Felix Rohatyn, who served as ambassador to France during the Clinton administration, and former Senator Warren Rudman, a Republican, have been sounding the alarm for a number of years now, urging the government to get over its unwillingness to invest adequately in public transportation systems, water projects, schools, dams, the electric grid, and so on.
 I remember Mr. Rohatyn telling me, ''A modern economy needs a modern platform, and that's the infrastructure.''
 The current concern over the economy should be taken by the government as a signal to finally move ahead on this critically important issue.

HEADLINE: Correction: For the Record

 BODY:
Articles on Wednesday about Fred D. Thompson's withdrawal from the Republican race for president and about the candidates' renewed focus on the economy carried incorrect datelines. The articles were written from Coral Springs, Fla.; there is no Coral Beach there. 
 Because of an editing error, an article on Jan. 17 about a new report on publication of drug company studies of antidepressants referred imprecisely to one of its findings. The report, in The New England Journal of Medicine, found that Eli Lilly had presented one study of its antidepressant Prozac as positive, even though a review of the study by the Food and Drug Administration determined that the drug did not perform as well as a placebo. None of the Prozac studies analyzed in the report went unpublished.
 An article in Business Day on Monday about the possible effect of a recession on media consumers and advertisers gave an incorrect middle initial for the chief operating officer of News Corporation. He is Peter A. Chernin, not Peter F. (The error has appeared in a number of articles since May 2006.)
 An article in Business Day on Thursday about the decline in fourth-quarter profit for Motorola referred incompletely to the decline in the stock price of Palm Inc., another struggling cellphone maker. Part of the 77 percent drop from the 52-week high in Palm's stock price as of Thursday can be attributed to a $9 dividend paid on Oct. 25, which caused the shares to fall to $8.50 from $19.18 a day earlier. 
 An article in Business Day on Monday about film studios' increasing interest in direct-to-DVD movies used an outdated title for a coming Warner Brothers production to be released directly on DVD. It has been changed to ''Get Smart's Bruce and Lloyd Out of Control'' from the original title, which was ''Get Smarter: Bruce & Lloyd Out of Control.'' 
 A sports article on Thursday about the hopes at Brown for an Ivy League men's basketball title misstated the status of a player at Cornell, Collin Robinson, a transfer from the University of Southern California who had been playing well. He left the team for personal reasons before the article was published.
 An art review in Weekend on Friday about an exhibition of works that Richard Diebenkorn made when he was in New Mexico, at the Grey Art Gallery at New York University, omitted a family member who arrived with Diebenkorn in New Mexico in 1950. In addition to his wife and young son, his young daughter accompanied him.
 An obituary on Saturday about the presidential adviser Richard G. Darman misstated the title held by James A. Baker III in the Department of Commerce when Mr. Darman served under him as assistant secretary of commerce. Mr. Baker was under secretary of commerce, not secretary of commerce.

HEADLINE: 5 G.I.'s Die In Ambush In Mosul

BYLINE: By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.; Ahmad Fadam and Abeer Mohammed contributed reporting from Baghdad, and an Iraqi employee of The New York Times from Mosul.

DATELINE: BAGHDAD 

 BODY:
Sunni Arab guerrillas ambushed an American convoy in the northern city of Mosul with a roadside bomb on Monday, then sprayed survivors with machine-gun fire from perches in a nearby mosque, killing five American soldiers. 
 It was the second devastating attack on United States forces this month, bringing the number of fatalities to 36 this year, and the latest sign that the main front of the insurgency has shifted to northern Iraq. 
 While American fatalities have fallen sharply in Baghdad and Anbar Province, they have not slowed in the north. Three-fifths of the American servicemen killed this year were in three provinces dominated by Sunni Arabs north of Baghdad. 
 Three weeks ago, a house rigged with explosives killed six soldiers in Diyala Province.
 The attack on Monday underscored the grim situation in Mosul, Iraq's northern hub, which remains a stronghold for Sunni extremist fighters. The Americans fought back and sent Iraqi soldiers to raid the mosque, but the gunmen had already fled, American military officials said.
 Under pressure to show firmness against the insurgency that still dominates parts of the north, Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki pledged last week to begin a ''decisive'' battle against militants in Mosul.
 He made that promise after a powerful blast shook the city last Wednesday as Iraqi soldiers entered a building packed with thousands of pounds of explosives. The Iraqi Red Crescent Organization reported that at least 60 people had been killed and 280 wounded, mostly children, women and the elderly. 
 The attack enraged residents, who were furious at government leaders for failing to protect them. The next morning, when the provincial police chief visited the site of the blast, he was stoned by a crowd of angry people who had been digging bodies of relatives from the rubble. As he tried to leave, he was assassinated by a suicide bomber.
 Iraqi officials have said they are massing an unspecified number of troops as well as equipment in Mosul, but they have disclosed little information about what they plan to do. American military officials say they are not expecting significant new operations, but more focused coordination between the Iraqi Army and the Iraqi police.
 The gunmen who attacked the convoy on Monday had been holed up in the Sunni Yarimjah mosque in southern Mosul, said Maj. Gary Dangerfield, a military spokesman. He said troops were continuing to conduct operations into the night in the surrounding area in pursuit of the guerrillas, who he said ''have no respect for Islam, for the people of Iraq or for the holy sites'' in Mosul.
 American troops swept into Sumar, a neighborhood of Mosul, on Monday afternoon, raiding and searching homes and engaging militants in gunfights, said Brig. Saeed al-Jibouri, a Mosul police spokesman. 
 ''The gunmen in the neighborhood panicked and clashed with the Americans,'' he said in a telephone interview on Monday evening. ''Sounds of gunfire can still be heard in the neighborhood, and the area is still surrounded by the American forces.''
 In Baghdad, a fire believed to have been started by arsonists set offices of the Iraq Central Bank ablaze early Monday morning, torching several floors and destroying documents that American officials said included contracts and records of financial transactions with overseas companies doing business in Iraq.
 Iraqi officials told American officials that they regarded the fire as potentially destabilizing to the Iraqi economy. But the Americans expressed less certainty that the fallout would be so dire, though they do not know exactly what was stored in the bank and what might have been taken.
 The Iraqi authorities detained 18 people, including some bank employees. It was unclear whether any were suspects in the case. The motive for the fire was not determined, but investigators said they thought the fire was set on purpose on the second floor. The officials said they did not know what was used to start the fire or whether chemicals were used to spread it.
 Water from fire hoses flooded vaults filled with cash on the first floor. Fire gutted the second and third floors. A blackened safe was discovered with its back torn open, suggesting the possibility of a robbery, although investigators said they did not know what the safe contained.
 Employees arriving for work were kept away from the building. They were told that the blaze had begun very early in the morning. One employee, who identified herself only as Rasha, said employees had been told to report for work on Tuesday. 
 ''They said, 'We will prepare another building for you to work in,' '' she said.

HEADLINE: Bush, Facing Woes in '08, Focuses on War and Taxes

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG; Eric Lichtblau contributed reporting from Washington, and Alissa J. Rubin from Baghdad.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Facing an unstable economy and an unfinished war, President Bush used his final State of the Union address Monday night to call for quick passage of his tax rebate package, patience in Iraq and a modest concluding agenda that includes $300 million in scholarship money for low-income children in struggling schools.
 With Senate Democrats already jockeying to amend the stimulus package that the administration negotiated with the House last week, Mr. Bush, in his address, urged lawmakers to resist the temptation to ''load up the bill'' with other provisions. To do so, he warned, ''would delay or derail it, and neither option is acceptable.''
 Yet Mr. Bush devoted relatively little of his 53 minute speech to the economy, the issue that is the top concern of voters during this election year. He spent far more time talking about the issue that has been his own primary concern, Iraq. 
 Mr. Bush made the case that his troop buildup had ''achieved results few of us could have imagined just one year ago,'' and reminded Americans that in coming months, 20,000 troops will have come home. Yet he avoided any timetable for further withdrawal and, if anything, seemed to be preparing the country for a far longer-term stay in Iraq, warning that a precipitous withdrawal could lead to a backslide in security.
 ''Members of Congress,'' Mr. Bush said, ''having come so far and achieved so much, we must not allow this to happen.'' 
 The White House had promised that the speech would look forward, not back. Facing the realities of a final year in office, with little time to win legislation from a Congress controlled by Democrats, Mr. Bush used the address to emphasize his power to block actions that he opposes. He vowed to veto any tax increases or legislative earmarks that were not voted on by the full Congress.
 But the speech, interrupted nearly 70 times by applause, was also infused with a sense of summing up, as Mr. Bush opened by remarking that ''our country has been tested in ways none of us could imagine'' since he delivered his first address to Congress, seven years ago.
 ''We have faced hard decisions about peace and war, rising competition in the world economy, and the health and welfare of our citizens,'' Mr. Bush said. ''These issues call for vigorous debate, and I think it's fair to say we've answered that call. Yet history will record that amid our differences, we acted with purpose.''
 Democrats responded by saying that Mr. Bush had offered ''little more than the status quo,'' in the words of the Senate Democratic leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, and the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi of California. 
 Yet the party's official response was not criticism but a call for unity, delivered by Gov. Kathleen Sebelius of Kansas. Ms. Sebelius urged the president to build on the bipartisanship of the stimulus package -- a sign that with the fall elections just 10 months away, Democrats are aware they must show voters they can work across the aisle.
 ''There is a chance, Mr. President, in the next 357 days, to get real results and give the American people renewed optimism that their challenges are the top priority,'' she said.
 Seven years have passed since Mr. Bush arrived in Washington, fresh from the Texas governor's mansion, with a sweeping domestic agenda and a grand promise to be a ''uniter, not a divider.'' But with the nation divided over the war, and many Americans already looking past Mr. Bush to the 2008 presidential race, he arrived in the House chamber on Monday night a politician with much less ambitious plans.
 Mr. Bush is grayer now than he was then, reflecting the strain of his time in office. And he is realistic, White House aides say, about what he might accomplish in his 51 weeks left. 
 In one poignant sign that his time is short, Mr. Bush's twin daughters, Jenna and Barbara, were seated in the first lady's box. It was the first time they had attended one of their father's State of the Union addresses.
 Looking ahead, on domestic affairs, Mr. Bush called on Congress to reauthorize his signature education bill, No Child Left Behind, and to pass pending trade agreements with Colombia, Panama and South Korea. He asked lawmakers to make his tax cuts permanent, and implored them to renew legislation permitting intelligence officials to eavesdrop on the communications of terrorism suspects and to provide legal immunity to phone companies that have helped in the wiretapping efforts.
 Yet even as Mr. Bush issued that call, lawmakers were at an impasse over the bill Monday night, as the Senate rejected two measures that would have forced votes on competing proposals -- a plan backed by the White House and a short-term effort by Democrats to extend by a month the existing eavesdropping law, which is set to expire on Friday.
 And though there is little to no chance that the Democratic Congress will tackle Social Security or illegal immigration, his two major domestic priorities, Mr. Bush could not resist urging them to do so. His counselor, Ed Gillespie, said Mr. Bush saw that as his presidential duty. 
 ''The president understands that nominees on both parties are going to have their own proposals and ideas on these fronts,'' Mr. Gillespie said, previewing the speech. ''That's where we are in the cycle of things.'' 
 On foreign affairs, the speech was as notable for what it did not mention as for what it did. Mr. Bush left out any mention of North Korea; he had hoped that by now North Korea would have disclosed all of its nuclear programs, giving the Bush administration a foreign policy achievement. But the North missed the Dec. 31 deadline for disclosure.
 On Iran, the third nation, beyond Iraq and North Korea, to make up Mr. Bush's ''axis of evil,'' the president repeated an oft-stated message, addressing his words directly to the Iranian people and their leaders. To the leaders, he said, ''Come clean about your nuclear intentions and past actions, stop your oppression at home and cease your support for terror abroad.''
 On Iraq, Mr. Bush expressed confidence that ''Al Qaeda'' would be defeated, even though American military officials have emphasized that the Sunni Arab insurgency remains resilient.
 Mr. Bush has often said he intended to ''sprint to the finish.'' Still, it was clear in his speech Monday night that the sprinting would involve relatively small steps. Beyond the scholarship money for low-income children, he offered just a handful of truly new initiatives.
 The president promised to use his veto pen to curtail by 50 percent the pet projects lawmakers sometimes insert into spending bills without full Congressional approval.
 Mr. Bush called on Congress to pass legislation that allows members of the military to transfer their G.I. Bill education benefits to spouses and children. And he promised to reduce or eliminate 151 government programs that he described as ''wasteful or bloated,'' to save $18 billion. 
 But many of the initiatives Mr. Bush announced were not new. He called on Congress to amend the tax code to make private health insurance more affordable, a plan he unveiled in his State of the Union address last year. He urged lawmakers to devote $30 billion over the next five years to combating the global AIDS epidemic, a proposal he announced in the Rose Garden in May. He asked Congress to pass a measure to ban human cloning, recycling a proposal from his 2006 State of the Union address.
 One area where Mr. Bush hopes to find bipartisan consensus is in the reauthorization of No Child Left Behind, one of his few bipartisan achievements. But even that may be difficult.
 ''Six years ago,'' the president said, ''we came together to pass the No Child Left Behind Act, and today no one can deny its results.'' 
 The remark brought applause from Republicans. But as he spoke, his main Democratic partner on the bill, Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, did not join in the clapping.

HEADLINE: For F.D.A., a Major Backlog Overseas

BYLINE: By GARDINER HARRIS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Food and Drug Administration is so understaffed that, at its current pace, the agency would need at least 27 years to inspect every foreign medical device plant that exports to the United States, 13 years to check every foreign drug plant and 1,900 years to examine every foreign food plant, according to government investigators.
 Computer systems at the drug agency are so inadequate that it can only guess the number of the plants, and it cannot produce a list of those that have not been inspected. The situation is particularly dire in China, which has more drug and device plants than any other foreign nation but where F.D.A. inspections are few. 
 These findings come from a series of reports by the Government Accountability Office -- obtained by The New York Times -- scheduled to be released Tuesday at a hearing of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. 
 The reports and a recent assessment by the agency's Science Board conclude that the F.D.A. is so overwhelmed by a flood of imports that it is incapable of protecting the public from unsafe drugs, medical devices and food. 
 ''This is a fundamentally broken agency, and it needs to be repaired,'' said Peter Barton Hutt, a former top lawyer with the agency who will testify Tuesday before the committee.
 Warnings about some of these problems have been sounded for years. And there have been fitful efforts at an overhaul. Last year, Congress passed and President Bush signed a law that changed the way the F.D.A. regulated the drug industry.
 But recent disasters involving several of the agency's crucial responsibilities -- a withdrawn painkiller, an unsafe implantable heart defibrillator, deadly pet food and contaminated spinach -- led to multiple Congressional investigations that came up with the same finding: After decades of political neglect, the agency is near the breaking point. As a result, there are growing calls on Capitol Hill to provide the agency with substantially more money.
 ''Our investigation has found ample evidence that F.D.A. inspections across the board are sorely lacking,'' said Representative John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan, the chairman of the House committee. ''How many more examples are needed to demonstrate that this agency is struggling and the public health is at risk?''
 The Bush administration has reacted coolly to calls for more financing. Mr. Bush recently established an import safety working group to reform the system ''within available resources.''
 An illustration of the agency's situation comes from a comparison of the allocated budgets of it and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 1987, the two had nearly identical budgets. Last year, the C.D.C. received nearly four times the amount given to the F.D.A.
 In the last 14 years, the drug agency has lost 1,311 employees and nearly $300 million in appropriations to inflation while Congress has passed more than 100 laws defining or expanding its regulatory responsibilities. The agency now regulates about $1 trillion worth of goods, or 25 cents of every dollar spent by consumers.
 The agency's field inspection force has suffered, particularly in the area of food. In 1973, the F.D.A. undertook 34,919 food inspections; in 2006, that number had dropped to 7,783.
 As the share of imported food, drugs and devices has soared, the number of agency import inspectors has plunged, to 380 in 2006 from 531 in 2003. Although 80 percent of the nation's drug supply is now imported, the F.D.A. last year inspected only 30 of more than 3,000 foreign drug plants. It inspected 100 of 190,000 foreign food plants.
 ''I think we've had a cascade of serious warning signs that the levies are leaking,'' said Dr. Garret A. FitzGerald of the University of Pennsylvania, a member of the agency's Science Board. ''We need to respond to these warnings before the hurricane hits.''
 Investigators for the Government Accountability Office found that, in many of its functions, the F.D.A. was unable to provide even basic information about its inspection responsibilities. For instance, one of the agency's computer programs estimates that 3,000 plants export drugs to the United States. Another entirely incompatible program pegs the number at 6,800.
 The backlog of inspections is even more profound among foreign medical device and food plants. Over a six-year period, the agency inspected 64 of the nearly 700 medical device plants registered in China. Medical devices can include items like stents and spinal screws.

HEADLINE: The State of the Union

 BODY:
Six years ago, President Bush began his State of the Union address with two powerful sentences: ''As we gather tonight, our nation is at war, our economy is in recession, and the civilized world faces unprecedented dangers. Yet the state of our union has never been stronger.''
 Monday night, after six years of promises unkept or insincerely made and blunders of historic proportions, the United States is now fighting two wars, the economy is veering toward recession and the civilized world still faces horrifying dangers -- and it has far less sympathy and respect for the United States. 
 The nation is splintered over the war in Iraq, cleaved by ruthless partisan politics, bubbling with economic fear and mired in debate over virtually all of the issues Mr. Bush faced in 2002. And the best Mr. Bush could offer was a call to individual empowerment -- a noble idea, but in Mr. Bush's hands just another excuse to abdicate government responsibility.
 Monday night's address made us think what a different speech it might have been if Mr. Bush had capitalized on the unity that followed the 9/11 attacks to draw the nation together, rather than to arrogate ever more power and launch his misadventure in Iraq. How different it might have been if Mr. Bush meant what he said about compassionate conservatism or even followed the fiscal discipline of old-fashioned conservatism. How different if he had made a real effort to reach for the bipartisanship he promised in 2002 and so many times since.
 Then he could have used last night's speech to celebrate a balanced budget, one in which taxes produce enough money to pay for the nation's genuine needs, including health care for poor children and a rebuilt New Orleans. Instead, Mr. Bush called -- again -- for his tax cuts to be permanent and threatened to veto bills that contained excessive pork-barrel spending, an idea absent from his agenda when Republicans held Congress.
 Had Mr. Bush been doing his job right just in the last few weeks, he could have used this speech to celebrate a genuinely bipartisan agreement on a sound economic stimulus plan. In addition to the tax rebates agreed on already between the White House and the House, Mr. Bush could have announced sensible proposals for extending unemployment benefits and a temporary increase in food stamps for the most vulnerable citizens.
 Those aren't just Democratic ideas. The independent Congressional Budget Office ranks those stimulus policies as far more effective than rebates. 
 If Mr. Bush had let compassion and good sense trump ideology, he would have been able to use last night's speech to celebrate the expansion of health insurance to tens of millions of children with working parents. Mr. Bush vetoed an expansion of the S-chip program, and he did not even agree to pay for all of the existing coverage because he thought a relative handful of parents might switch from private to public insurance if they were offered government assistance to buy it.
 In 2003, the president proposed the Medicare prescription drug benefit, his signature achievement in health insurance reform. It barely squeaked past conservative Republicans in Congress, and Mr. Bush's appetite for making health care accessible and affordable for all Americans vanished.
 Mr. Bush has included a call for immigration reform in all of his previous State of the Union addresses. But he has never matched that rhetoric with strong ideas or political passion. A push last year for comprehensive reform was defeated by his party's right wing, which continues to spread hatred on the campaign trail. His insight last night: ''Illegal immigration is complicated.''
 In 2002, Mr. Bush spoke about the international coalition that invaded Afghanistan, about the consensus among civilized nations of the need to combat terrorism, about the way the 9/11 attacks had rallied nations behind America's leadership. Afghanistan's good war was quickly overshadowed -- and shortchanged -- by Mr. Bush's Iraq folly. Six years later, the United States and its allies are still fighting and dying in Afghanistan and the Taliban is back in force.
 He was not even able to assure Americans that there is an end in sight to the Iraq war. Instead, he made the same empty promise he has made every year: When Iraq can defend itself, American troops will come home. Iraq's defense minister told The Times recently that his forces would not be able to fully keep the peace and defend their country until 2018. 
 Mr. Bush's troop escalation has succeeded in stabilizing parts of Baghdad and lowering casualties. But 2007 was still the most violent year in Iraq since the 2003 invasion and -- more important -- Mr. Bush has little to show in the way of political reconciliation, the only guarantor of a lasting peace. Mr. Bush has made no real effort to seek the help of Iraq's neighbors to help stabilize the country.
 In the end, when it comes to Iraq, Mr. Bush's annual addresses will be remembered most for his false claims -- the fictitious ''axis of evil,'' nonexistent aluminum tubes and African uranium, dangerous weapons that did not exist. No president can want that as his legacy.
 Mr. Bush still has a year left -- and many serious problems to address. It is time, finally, for him to put aside the partisanship, the bluster and the empty rhetoric. The state of the union is troubled. The nation yearns for leadership.

HEADLINE: Senate Panel Unveils Plan Of Its Own to Aid Economy

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Senate Finance Committee, moving to put its own stamp on a rescue plan for the ailing economy, unveiled a $156 billion fiscal stimulus package on Monday. The plan would pay $500 to most individual tax filers and $1,000 to couples, with an additional $300 a child for families, with no income cap to disqualify high earners. 
 The Senate package would cost more than the stimulus plan agreed to last week by President Bush, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the Republican leader, Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, but there are differences over how much more. The Senate has not released the cost of the plan's components, nor does it estimate the cost beyond 2008. 
 House officials now say their plan, to be voted on Tuesday, would cost $145.9 billion in 2008. Some aides who worked on the House plan said Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Boehner had rejected some components in the Senate proposal as too expensive. The aides predicted that the true cost of the Senate plan would be more than $156 billion, potentially derailing efforts by the White House and Congressional leaders to aid the economy as quickly as possible. 
 The Senate proposal is less generous to some but more generous to others. For example, a household with two working parents and two children would most likely receive $1,800 under the House plan, but only $1,600 under the Senate proposal. But the Senate plan would send $500 checks to some 20 million Americans over age 62 living only on Social Security who would be excluded by the House plan. The Senate plan would also extend unemployment benefits by 13 weeks in all states, in addition to the 26 weeks provided under current law, at a cost of about $12.5 billion. The House would not extend unemployment payments.
 Like the House plan, the Senate proposal contains several tax breaks for businesses, including an increase in the amount of expenses that small businesses can immediately write off. But the Senate added another incentive, allowing businesses to deduct losses from up to five years ago. Current law allows losses to be carried forward for two years. 
 The House plan, which Mr. Bush had urged Congress to approve as quickly as possible, would pay at least $300 to all tax filers with at least $3,000 in earned income, and would give rebates of up to $600 for individuals and up to $1,200 for couples. Those rebates phase out for individuals earning more than $75,000 and couples earning above $150,000. 
 Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana and chairman of the Finance Committee, who unveiled the plan, said it would be discussed Wednesday. The plan does not include initiatives like spending on infrastructure, energy tax credits or an increase in food stamps that other senators may try to add. The majority leader, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, has said he intends to bring the proposal to the floor for a vote as soon as possible, perhaps Wednesday or Thursday. 
 The Senate would have to reconcile its stimulus bill with the measure the House is likely to approve Tuesday, requiring additional work and votes, before a final version could be sent to the White House. 
 In his State of the Union address on Monday, Mr. Bush repeated his warning against complicating the House plan. ''The temptation will be to load up the bill,'' he said. ''That would delay it or derail it, and neither option is acceptable. This is a good agreement that will keep our economy growing and our people working. And this Congress must pass it as soon as possible.''
 House Republicans quickly accused Senate Democrats of jeopardizing the stimulus effort. Ms. Pelosi, however, said she remained confident. ''I'm optimistic that we will have a plan that is timely, passed very quickly, targeted to those who will spend it and inject demand into the economy to create jobs and turn around the downturn.''
 The Senate plan does not include the proposal by the House to increase the limits on ''conforming'' mortgages that can be bought by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, or insured by the Federal Housing Administration.

HEADLINE: Kennedy Backs Obama With 'Old Politics' Attack

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY; Alison Leigh Cowan contributed reporting from Hartford, and Katie Zezima from Springfield, Mass.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Senator Edward M. Kennedy implored Americans on Monday ''to turn the page on the old politics of misrepresentation and distortion,'' as he placed the aura of the most prominent Democratic family around Senator Barack Obama's candidacy.
 At a rally here at American University, as two generations of Kennedys surrounded Mr. Obama on stage, and Caroline Kennedy and Representative Patrick J. Kennedy, Democrat of Rhode Island, offered their own endorsements, Mr. Kennedy offered a fierce rebuttal to questions that Mr. Obama's rivals had raised about his experience and readiness for the job. 
 ''He will be a president who refuses to be trapped in the patterns of the past,'' Mr. Kennedy said, interrupting his speech more than once to embrace Mr. Obama. ''He is a leader who sees the world clearly without being cynical. He is a fighter who cares passionately about the causes he believes in without demonizing those who hold a different view.''
 Mr. Kennedy plans to campaign this week for Mr. Obama in Arizona, California and New Mexico, hoping to influence voters torn between Mr. Obama, of Illinois, and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York. 
 As Mr. Kennedy's speech was shown on news channels, Mrs. Clinton received a raucous reception at a rally in Massachusetts. She made no reference to being overlooked by Mr. Kennedy, and in a call with reporters, she said, ''We're all proud of the people we have endorsing us.''
 The political blessing from Mr. Kennedy, though, was far from a routine endorsement. Controversial among Republicans, he is nonetheless influential among many Democrats and could be particularly helpful in courting older voters, union members and Latinos. All candidates, including Mrs. Clinton, vigorously pursued his endorsement because of the symbolism and lore it represents. 
 Mr. Obama said he was humbled by the comparisons drawn with John F. Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy. 
 ''I was too young to remember John Kennedy and I was just a child when Robert Kennedy ran for president,'' Mr. Obama, 46, said. ''But in the stories I heard growing up, I saw how my grandparents and mother spoke about them and about that period in our nation's life as a time of great hope and achievement.''
 In a 20-minute address, Mr. Kennedy hailed Mr. Obama's ability to transcend racial divisions. Mr. Kennedy, who associates said had become furious by the tone of the Democratic campaign, including the words and actions of former President Bill Clinton, said Mr. Obama would usher in a new era of politics.
 ''With Barack Obama, there is a new national leader who has given America a different kind of campaign, not just about himself, but about all of us,'' Mr. Kennedy said. ''A campaign about the country we will become, if we can rise above the old politics that parses us into separate groups and puts us at odds with one another.''
 Mr. Obama also was endorsed by the author Toni Morrison, who once described Mr. Clinton as America's first black president. Ms. Morrison praised Mrs. Clinton but said she was supporting Mr. Obama because of his ''wisdom.''
 With a 22-state campaign battleground over the next week for the Democratic candidates, Mrs. Clinton focused criticism on President Bush's handling of the economy and foreign affairs as she addressed large crowds in Connecticut and Massachusetts. She did not mention the names of her rivals, Mr. Obama or former Senator John Edwards, as she reminded voters that she, too, would make history if elected.
 ''I will bring to the White House my perspective as a daughter, a wife and a mother, because that's never been in the White House before,'' she said. ''I know what it's like to have to be at work and your baby wakes up sick. I know what it's like when the baby sitter calls in sick. I know what it's like when the appointment you thought would be done when your child gets out of school isn't done and keeps on going.''
 Mrs. Clinton returned to Washington for the State of the Union address, an occasion filled with more political theater than usual because of the endorsements and the fact that she would be in the room with Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Obama.
 Mr. Kennedy praised Mr. Edwards and Mrs. Clinton as friends, but he presented his endorsement of Mr. Obama in a deeply personal way. Seldom does he mention his brothers, both of whom were assassinated, in public appearances. But he made repeated references to them. 
 ''There was another time, when another young candidate was running for president and challenging America to cross a new frontier,'' Mr. Kennedy said. ''He faced criticism from the preceding Democratic president, who was widely respected in the party,'' a reference to Harry S. Truman. ''And John Kennedy replied: 'The world is changing. The old ways will not do. It is time for a new generation of leadership.' ''
 ''So it is,'' he added, ''with Barack Obama.''

HEADLINE: Power Through Delegates May Be Edwards Strategy

BYLINE: By JULIE BOSMAN

DATELINE: CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. 

 BODY:
With the Democratic nominating contest building to Feb. 5, the candidates have been focusing on the crucial game of accumulating delegates, a task that has become a possible raison d'etre for John Edwards.
 After finishing third in three of the four primary contests so far -- except in Iowa, where he beat Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York for second place by less than one percentage point -- Mr. Edwards has shown no sign of quitting, and his advisers have insisted that he still hopes to capture the nomination.
 But they have also floated other rationales for a continued Edwards candidacy, suggesting that his delegates could be used to promote his platform or to help him act as a power broker at the Democratic convention. 
 ''We're still hoping that John is the nominee,'' said David Bonior, the national campaign manager. ''But with a chunk of delegates, you can leverage what you've been fighting for and standing for. You can raise these issues to where they should be on the Democratic agenda. We're running for those two reasons: to get the nomination and to have his voice heard on his issues.''
 Mr. Edwards has accumulated some delegates, giving him a seat at the table -- or at least in debates -- with Mrs. Clinton and Senator Barack Obama of Illinois. He has often steered the conversation on policy, and was the first candidate to outline a universal health care plan and an economic stimulus proposal. 
 Yet his chance to win the nomination appears slim. After months of exposure -- and in his second bid for the nomination -- national polls still have him around 14 percent.
 He did not even win in South Carolina, where he was born. And Mr. Edwards, a former senator from North Carolina, has received no endorsements from major newspapers or senators. 
 In 2004, Mr. Edwards dropped out of the presidential race after losing every state on a multiprimary day to Senator John Kerry -- and that year he had won South Carolina.
 But this year, the crowded field and the splintered results have given Mr. Edwards the chance to influence the race. As he did in South Carolina, Mr. Edwards may divide the white vote with Mrs. Clinton in states like Alabama, Georgia and Tennessee, boosting Mr. Obama's chances. Elsewhere, Mr. Edwards could attract some of the so-called change voters, hurting Mr. Obama. 
 There are signs that Mrs. Clinton, for one, is unnerved by Mr. Edwards's continued presence in the race. Last week in South Carolina, her campaign unleashed a wave of automated telephone calls attacking Mr. Edwards's voting record in the Senate and his work as a consultant for a hedge fund in 2005 and 2006.
 There could be a significant payoff for his staying in the race. He could pledge his delegates at any point, including at a brokered Democratic convention in August if neither Mrs. Clinton nor Mr. Obama captured 50 percent, or 2,025, of the delegates, the number needed to take the nomination. 
 ''It's obvious what he has in mind -- if you can't be the king, then be the king or queen maker,'' said Larry J. Sabato, a political scientist at the University of Virginia. ''He's thinking perhaps Obama and Clinton will have a close split of delegates once the primaries are over, and his 300 or 400 delegates will make the difference. This is his one chance to have a real influence.''
 Mr. Edwards is keeping up a relentless schedule, this week in Georgia, Minnesota, Missouri, North Dakota and Tennessee, all states that will vote on Feb. 5, and he is running television advertisements in 10 states. 
 Money is still not a problem, his aides insisted. Though Mr. Edwards has raised significantly less than Mrs. Clinton or Mr. Obama has raised, his campaign has been on a budget of $1.2 million a month and has enough to go through the primaries. He has raised more than $3 million this month, in part because of liberal bloggers, who recently organized a one-day fund-raiser that brought in more than $300,000.

HEADLINE: What's the State of the Union? Well, Gleeful, if You're a Democrat

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE; Jeff Zeleny contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Democrats never seemed so elated about the prospect of a major speech by President Bush. Or of having it finished.
 ''I think everybody is ready to turn the page,'' said Representative Mark Udall, Democratic of Colorado, as he and his colleagues poured out of Mr. Bush's last State of the Union address.
 ''Next year we'll have a different president, which I look forward to,'' said Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, Democrat, majority leader and frequent nemesis of the president. 
 They were not the only ones quick to note the finality of the moment: Mr. Bush's last State of the Union speech after a presidency that saw Democrats battered at the polls in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks, only to regain power last year. Now they face the coming election with optimism. 
 Democrats sat quietly while Republicans cheered many of the president's applause lines, no longer afraid of seeming to slight Mr. Bush. They snickered at some points and some called aloud for a return of troops from Iraq. ''Bring them home, bring them home,'' they chanted. 
 Even Republicans acknowledged the sense that an era was ending with Mr. Bush, still low in the polls and running out of time, stepping up to the teleprompters in the House one last time. One Senate ally said he sensed that the White House was going through the motions. And Republicans admit, privately, that they face a political challenge in November given the unpopularity of the war in Iraq and rising fears about the economy.
 Some Republicans found the Democrats' tone off-putting and out of sync with the bipartisanship of recent efforts to speed an economic package through Congress to bolster the economy.
 ''I don't know what they gain by this relentless stream of negativity,'' said Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas. ''But I guess they just can't seem to help themselves.'' The sense of transition was magnified Monday by intense focus on the body language in the House chamber as the two leading Democratic candidates for president, Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York and Barack Obama of Illinois, returned for a couple of intelligence-related votes earlier in the day and the president's speech. And they did so on the same day that Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts delivered a ringing endorsement of Mr. Obama that many saw as a rebuke of former President Bill Clinton and his recent conduct on the campaign trail. Mr. Obama walked into the chamber, with Mr. Kennedy directly behind him. They took their seats, side-by-side, sealing the image of their newfound partnership.
 Sitting just four chairs away, Mrs. Clinton was engaged in conversation with a number of senators, but not Mr. Obama. When Mr. Kennedy extended his hand and they exchanged a brief handshake, Mr. Obama's head turned the other way. After the address, Mr. Obama chatted briefly with Mr. Bush, while Mrs. Clinton exited the chamber.
 For Democrats, the political theater was a highlight of the night.
 ''It's an end, but it's also a beginning,'' said Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota. ''Somewhere in that chamber was the next president.''
 The State of the Union is one of the major annual set pieces on Capitol Hill, and the complex was buzzing with receptions, preparations and political talk. The Arab television station Al Jazeera for the first time had a camera station in Statuary Hall, where lawmakers flock after the address to deliver reactive sound bites to television stations back home.
 Democrats believe that Mr. Bush's tenure has put them in strong shape for the coming elections. And while they were clearly pleased that this was to be his last State of the Union speech, they were not as elated about the contents, particularly its emphasis on reducing the pet projects known as earmarks beloved by many in Congress. 
 Republicans said they thought Democrats were misreading public opinion just as they had misread Mr. Bush for years.
 ''I think he wants to finish strong,'' said Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. ''President Bush and I have disagreed at times, but I think he has been a bold president with his ideas. Congress will make a big mistake if we don't jump on board with his idea for earmark reform.''
 Leading Democrats said the focus on home-state spending that many constituents expect was the very definition of small-bore thinking. A few compared it to former President Bill Clinton's 1994 State of the Union embrace of school uniforms as a way to stem school violence. Mr. Reid said the president was evidently ''hard up'' for policy initiatives. 
 Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the California Democrat working with the administration on the economic plan, said, ''To realize that the president of the United States, in his final State of the Union address, is not talking about the promise of the future, he is talking about the process of an appropriations bill, I think that's pretty sad.'' 
 Representative Jack Kingston, a Georgia Republican, said there was definitely a different feel in the House.
 ''I think there was a certain relaxation and calmness to the president knowing it was his last speech,'' he said. ''And I think there was a certain relaxation and calmness to the Democrats knowing it was his last speech.''

HEADLINE: Camelot '08 Overshadows Bush Speech

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY

 BODY:
The day began in Camelot and ended in Southfork. 
 Viewers on Monday were treated to a rare look at three dynasties working out their psychodramas at once: In his final State of the Union address, President Bush, the rebel Texan who defied his father, struggled to avoid the gloom of recession that darkened his father's final days in the Oval Office. On the campaign trail, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton tried to patch over the pricklier parts of her husband's legacy, while in Washington, the Kennedy clan sought vindication -- and renewed vigor -- by passing the torch to an adopted heir.
 There was nothing mournful or valedictory about Mr. Bush's delivery of his seventh State of the Union address, a speech that acknowledged, however briefly, that the economy is in trouble. Mr. Bush, looking fresh and rested, made a point of sounding good-humored as he delivered less-than-glowing news. 
 At times, it seemed as if Mr. Bush was determined to turn the clock back before his presidency and his father's, as if to reclaim, one last time, the mantle of Ronald Reagan. 
 Mr. Bush even presented his promise to extend tax cuts with a Reagan-style joke. ''Others have said they would personally be happy to pay higher taxes,'' Mr. Bush said, twinkling roguishly. ''I welcome their enthusiasm, and I am pleased to report that the I.R.S. accepts both checks and money orders.'' (The camera pointedly zoomed in on Mrs. Clinton, who was pointedly not amused.) 
 It was a smooth, but strangely muted performance, almost as if Mr. Bush were attaching a postscript to his presidency.
 His words, moreover, were eclipsed by the image of Caroline Kennedy and Senator Edward M. Kennedy anointing Senator Barack Obama as the true successor to John F. Kennedy. That tableau from a rally at American University, shown over and over throughout the day, was powerful and also poignant -- the camera showed all too vividly that in passing the torch to Mr. Obama, the patriarch of the Kennedy clan was bypassing his own scions.
 Representative Patrick J. Kennedy, Democrat of Rhode Island, on the stage but not of the moment, kept standing up during his father's and Mr. Obama's speeches, as if to sneak into the camera's frame. At one point while Ms. Kennedy was speaking, Senator Kennedy leaned toward Mr. Obama, who put both his arms around the senator as the two men shared a joke. Young Mr. Kennedy leaned over to try to hear their conversation, but was ignored. 
 The endorsement was a boon to Mr. Obama, of course, but it also served the Kennedy family interests, lending the fading clan a flash of power -- and moral standing -- that these days is most evident at family funerals. So many members of the younger generation of Kennedys are dead or disqualified; the dynasty that bestowed its mystique and political influence on Mr. Obama was also feeding on his youth and charisma. 
 Television news reports were understandably intoxicated by the rush of nostalgia -- and evocative images. On ABC's ''World News,'' a reporter noted solemnly, ''the audacity of hope had its rendezvous with destiny.'' When Mr. Obama was described as a ''son of Camelot,'' ABC's screen was filled by a black-and-white clip of President Kennedy lifting young John-John in his arms. 
 No cable network was as excited as MSNBC. In the long cable countdown to the endorsement, CNN and Fox News switched to other campaigns -- showing Mrs. Clinton campaigning (without her husband) in Connecticut, and Mitt Romney and Senator John McCain sparring in Florida. MSNBC wouldn't leave the auditorium of American University and instead kept its camera trained on an empty stage -- like a child stubbornly glued to the window, waiting for Daddy to come home. 
 There was magic in the Kennedy images, and also a tinge of malice: Throughout the day, cable news contrasted the pictures of Mr. Obama standing arm and arm with Senator Kennedy and his niece, with old clips of the Clintons back when they enjoyed the favor of Senator Kennedy and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis -- in baseball caps boating off Martha's Vineyard and striding with Kennedy family members across the White House lawn. 
 If Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton exchanged pleasantries in the Capitol last night, the camera missed it.

HEADLINE: Who's Black and Female And How Do They Vote?

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
In the Democratic presidential primary next Tuesday, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton appears to have an advantage in New York City: Among enrolled Democrats, women outnumber men by about half a million, or 50 percent.
 But New York's political calculus can be more complicated than that. Some of the biggest gender gaps in enrollment are in Congressional districts with largely black populations. 
 ''It's not just gender,'' said Lee M. Miringoff, director of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion. Young women as well as black women ''will be voting for Barack Obama,'' he said. 
 In New York, though, black women generally account for a smaller share of the Democratic primary electorate than they did Saturday in South Carolina, where they helped propel Senator Obama to a landslide victory.
 And in New York, because Mr. Obama focused on fielding full delegate slates in all 29 Congressional districts -- a mission his supporters accomplished -- his campaign had less time to register young people and blacks, who have voted for him disproportionately in earlier primaries.
 In marked contrast to 1984 and 1988, when Jesse Jackson's supporters enrolled some 150,000 new voters before the New York presidential primary, fewer than 30,000 have been added to the rolls in New York City since Nov. 1.
 Of the 5.3 million Democrats eligible to vote in New York State next Tuesday, about 2.6 million live in the city. Of those, more than 1 million are men and 1.5 million are women, a much wider gender gap than exists elsewhere in the state.
 In New York, some black women said they found the historic circumstances of this year's Democratic primary campaign to be liberating.
 ''I'm freed from having to make my choice along gender or racial lines,'' said Binta Brown, a Manhattan lawyer and Clinton supporter. ''It allows me, and a lot of other women, to look at who these people are and what they 
 have to offer this country. To me, it's a no-brainer.''
 Joyce Johnson, the state field director of the Obama campaign, acknowledged that some black women feel pulled in both directions. ''Hillary is the woman in front of us who has a chance,'' she said, ''but beyond race and gender, there is something that has captured this country, and that something is Barack Obama.''
 A statewide WNBC/Marist Poll released last week showed Mrs. Clinton leading among all likely voters, 48 percent to 32 percent. She was ahead among all women, 51 percent to 31 percent.
 Mr. Obama was leading among black likely voters, though, 67 percent to 26 percent, and among black women by a smaller but still commanding margin, 57 percent to 31 percent. And 12 percent of black women said they were still undecided, a higher proportion than among most other groups.
 Sex and race are by no means unambiguous predictors of whom New Yorkers will support, although in a number of early primaries women have voted by lopsided margins for Mrs. Clinton and blacks for Mr. Obama.
 A test of how black women reconcile divided loyalties came Saturday in South Carolina, where black women made up 35 percent of the voters. Mr. Obama received the support of 78 percent of black women, compared with 80 percent of black men, according to exit polls conducted by Edison/Mitofsky for the National Election Pool of television networks and The Associated Press. 
 Mrs. Clinton was supported by about 3 in 10 women over all, the South Carolina exit polls indicated, including 4 in 10 white women and 2 in 10 black women. In the New Hampshire primary, where the vast majority of voters are white, Mrs. Clinton won 46 percent of female voters and Mr. Obama 34.
 In New York's 2004 presidential primary, according to surveys of voters leaving the polls, women constituted 57 percent of the statewide vote. Black and Hispanic women (Mrs. Clinton has been running ahead among Hispanic voters in early primaries) together made up about 19 percent. The gender gap also exists in a number of predominantly Hispanic Congressional districts.
 ''In a Democratic primary, she definitely has an edge because she's a woman,'' said Jerry Skurnick, whose company, Prime New York, analyzes voting patterns.
 John H. Mollenkopf, executive director of the Center for Urban Research at the City University of New York Graduate Center, said that generally, the enrollment figures should favor Mrs. Clinton, particularly in her home state.
 ''All other things held constant, the gender differential in registration should help Senator Clinton,'' he said. ''It will be very interesting to see what African-American women voters do. My guess is that women voters will be less likely to vote for him than men, and older women less likely than younger women.'' 
 Assemblyman Hakeem Jeffries of Brooklyn, who is supporting Senator Obama, said, ''African-American women have reason to be proud of both Senator Obama's candidacy and Senator Clinton's, and at the end of the day their decision will be based on which candidate speaks most profoundly to the issues they care most about.''
 Ann Lewis, a senior adviser to Mrs. Clinton, said, ''We would never assume that women voters vote on the basis of gender alone,'' but suggested that her candidate might benefit from the nation's rising concerns about the economy.
 ''Historically, women are more vulnerable and they're the budget-keepers, and this is an issue that Hillary has been stepping out on,'' she said.
 Minyon Moore, another Clinton senior adviser, said her candidate had a record of raising issues like ''health care, elderly parents, making sure your children have safe environments'' and saw women ''as parents, caretakers and sometimes as single providers for households.''
 ''You'd be torn if you were voting based on race or gender, but if you were voting on who could move this country forward, there is no contest,'' Miss Moore said. She added, though, that since a woman and a black candidate are leading in the polling, black women, in particular, are in an enviable position in making their choice.
 ''We don't have to be against anybody,'' she said.
 But Mr. Obama, who was endorsed over the weekend by Caroline Kennedy, the daughter of the former president, has been working hard to claim a special understanding of female voters. In South Carolina last week, as he courted women, black and white, Mr. Obama said: ''I'll be honest with you. Women are carrying a bigger load. The reason I know this? I was raised by a single mom.''

To the Editor:
 Re ''Obama Carries South Carolina by Wide Margin'' (front page, Jan. 27):
 Propelled by South Carolina's winning results, Senator Barack Obama is even with Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton at two and two in contested early-voting states, and the Democratic Party's nomination race is now headed toward an exciting finish. 
 This forceful fight between the two most eligible presidential contenders can become more spirited if both candidates focus on thrashing out the core issues confronting our country and refrain from making any personal attacks and unwarranted and unfounded criticism. 
 If this is adopted as the unwritten code of conduct for all elections, the voters will have an opportunity to make a well-informed decision based on the candidates' merits and vision for America's betterment, notwithstanding any race or gender factor. 
 After all, endorsing the right candidate and hoping the best for America and its people will in fact be every voter's own self-introspection test in the primaries as well in the national balloting. 
 Atul M. Karnik Woodside, Queens, Jan. 27, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Bingo! In ''A President Like My Father'' (Op-Ed, Jan. 27), Caroline Kennedy got it exactly right.
 In February 1963, I entered the Peace Corps, eager to serve my president and the ideals of my country in a remote mountain village in Colombia. There, a world away, villagers knew about, admired, respected and even loved John F. Kennedy, one couple naming their newborn son John Kennedy Muelas. 
 Later, as a college professor for 35 years, I somewhat nostalgically displayed President Kennedy's picture in my office, but his image was also a reminder that no occupant of the White House has been nearly so inspirational since Nov. 22, 1963.
 Now we have Barack Obama, and as I sense so strongly that the old power to inspire is back, I realize how important it is, not only for our country, but also for the whole world. Thank you, Caroline, for saying it so well. 
 Paul Mundschenk Carbondale, Ill., Jan. 27, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Caroline Kennedy states that she is supporting Senator Barack Obama, because he, like her father, will get us to ''believe in ourselves'' and make us feel ''inspired and hopeful.'' That is all well and good, but the reality is that, while he was inspirational, the verdict on her father's short presidency is very mixed.
 He fell into the debacle of the Bay of Pigs, escalated the Vietnam War and, fortunately for him, did not receive any press scrutiny on his ties to organized crime as well as his excessive extramarital dalliances in the White House.
 While it is great to be inspired, our times also call for competence, leadership and substantive experience to bring about the real changes toward universal health care, fiscal responsibility, environmental stewardship and so much more that will make us truly ''believe in ourselves.'' The candidate who can best bring that to fruition is Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
 Joan Sommers Hackensack, N.J., Jan. 27, 2008
 To the Editor:
 My first time voting was for Caroline Kennedy's father, John F. Kennedy. He was the candidate for many of us enthusiastic youth in the days when we believed that this was our country and that those of us in it could do wonders together with strong leadership. 
 Under Kennedy's presidency we were inspired to hope and to believe and to work. We were privileged to experience his leadership. We have been cheated of that inspiration by his death and subsequent presidents. 
 I am 68 years old, and though disappointed and in mourning for that loss, I am once again filled with the charged enthusiasm and hope that Caroline expresses. 
 Mary Jo Olsen Bellingham, Wash., Jan. 27, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Caroline Kennedy's moving endorsement of Senator Barack Obama highlights what I feel is the most important thing any leader does: Set a tone. A great leader inspires and appeals to our highest ideals, our hopes and our dreams. A great leader brings us together and helps us to see the good in one another. 
 The Bush administration has spent seven years stirring up our fear and intolerance, weakening our Constitution, our social fabric, our economy, our civil liberties and our reputation abroad in the process. Let's be great again, America! 
 Margaret Caldwell Shorewood, Wis., Jan. 27, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Re ''Questions for the Clintons,'' by Bob Herbert (column, Jan. 26): Mr. Herbert took a piece of a complimentary statement I made about Senator Barack Obama's being qualified to be president, imputed that my motive was to ''slime'' the senator, sandwiched a few of my words between a statement by Andrew Young and a vile anonymous Internet posting, and rested his case.
 Though I am generally not surprised by this technique, as a regular reader of Mr. Herbert, I was surprised by his use of the device. I attribute this to the passions this campaign has aroused.
 This letter is written to restate my compliment of Senator Obama.
 If he becomes president of the United States, his experience will give him the capacity to undo much of the damage we have done to our standing in Muslim communities without weakening our resolve to keep ourselves safe from terrorist Islamic groups.
 Bob Kerrey New York, Jan. 27, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Thanks to Bob Herbert for questioning the Clinton campaign. It has become obvious to me that the Clintons view the American public only as potential voters, and not as fellow citizens. While they continue to insist that political spin and negative tactics are all just in ''fun,'' the Clintons consistently and dangerously ignore the devastating material effects of their efforts. 
 As a college student growing up during the Bush-Clinton era, I have been forced to live within the wreckage of such divisiveness, learning to expect nothing but incompetence from government and complacency from citizens. Thank goodness for Barack Obama, who has encouraged my generation not only to go out and vote, but also to believe that government can play a role in uplifting its people. 
 Thanks to his campaign, I now know what true political leadership looks like -- and it does not look like Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
 Leslie Allison Philadelphia, Jan. 26, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Re ''It's Not Giuliani Time in Florida'' (column, Jan. 27):
 Yes, just like Maureen Dowd, many expected a lot more out of Rudolph W. Giuliani than we have seen to this point. Where in the world is that candidate who before the first primary was supposed to be one of the Republican front-runners? 
 As usual, Ms. Dowd very succinctly boils it down to one catch phrase: ''He needs to quit talking about 9/11 and dial 911.'' Is there any doubt that unless Mr. Giuliani changes his tune, unless he starts talking about what is currently on the minds of Americans, his road to the White House is all but over?

HEADLINE: A Nod to Big Ideas of the Past, but Domestic Issues Are Now the Focus

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Making his seventh and final State of the Union address, President Bush proposed a short list of initiatives Monday that more than anything else underscored the White House's growing realization that his biggest political opponents now are time and an electorate already looking beyond him. 
 This address lacked the soaring ambitions of Mr. Bush's previous speeches, though it had its rhetorical flourishes. He invoked the ''miracle of America'' but for the most part flatly recited familiar ideas -- cutting taxes, fighting terrorists, the war in Iraq -- rather than bold new ones. Nothing he proposed Monday is likely to redefine how history judges his presidency. 
 The biggest initiatives of the second Bush term -- the remaking of Social Security and the emotionally charged issue of illegal immigration -- are now in the category of what the White House calls ''unfinished business.'' Mr. Bush mentioned them on Monday only to state the obvious: both will remain unfinished on his watch. 
 So, too, will the war in Iraq, the issue that will define his legacy more than any other, and one for which he pointedly offered no new promises of troop withdrawals beyond those already proposed by the American commander in Iraq, Gen. David H. Petraeus. Mr. Bush said he would instead await the recommendations now being drafted by General Petraeus at his headquarters at the presumptively named Camp Victory in Baghdad.
 In contrast to last year's address to Congress, where he faced skepticism about sending more troops to Iraq, Mr. Bush cited a drop in violence and nascent signs of political reconciliation there. Rather than signaling a more rapid withdrawal, though, the president noted General Petraeus's warnings that the gains could quickly be reversed.
 ''We must do the difficult work today,'' he said, ''so that years from now, people will look back and say that this generation rose to the moment, prevailed in a tough fight and left behind a more hopeful region and a safer America.''
 Mr. Bush now has less than a year left in office. But as the White House counselor, Ed Gillespie, noted on Monday, the window for realistically accomplishing much of anything during an election year will close by the time Congress adjourns in the summer and the presidential nominating conventions begin. 
 This year's campaign is such that the State of the Union Message -- an annual ritual of American governance for more than two centuries -- seemed like little more than a brief distraction between Senator Edward M. Kennedy's endorsement of Senator Barack Obama on Monday afternoon and Florida's primary vote on Tuesday. One Republican candidate, Senator John McCain, skipped the address to squeeze in a last day of campaigning there. 
 ''Everybody appears to be looking downstream,'' Scott Reed, a veteran Republican consultant, said Monday.
 What the president did propose in his address was modest, focused more than ever on domestic matters and the growing concern about the economy.
 An economic stimulus that has already moved forward; a campaign against ''earmarks'' for frivolous spending projects; grants for students in failing urban schools; new benefits for veterans and their families -- all may be worthy proposals, and some may feasibly be enacted.
 Mr. Bush's aides insisted, again, that he would ''sprint to the finish.'' Not coincidentally, perhaps, the image conjures Ronald Reagan's vow in his last State of the Union message. ''Let's make this the best of eight,'' Mr. Reagan said 20 years ago. ''And that means it's all out, right to the finish line.''
 Mr. Reagan went on in that final year to reach deals with the Democrats involving trade, immigration and welfare, while signing an arms control treaty with the Soviet Union. Mr. Bush's aides would hardly disparage the comparison, and he also held out hope for a peace treaty between Israel and the Palestinians by the end of his presidency.
 But Mr. Bush's final address also reflected that of the last two-term president. Bill Clinton, hobbled by impeachment but still far more popular at that point in his presidency than Mr. Bush is now, proposed a buffet of modest, centrist proposals, including cutting taxes for married couples, increasing grants for college and having Medicare pay for prescription drugs (which Mr. Bush's administration finally accomplished). At the time, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas criticized Mr. Clinton's ''litany of spending programs.''
 Both Mr. Reagan and Mr. Clinton delivered their final State of the Union messages with the fate of their vice presidents in mind, promoting legislative agendas that amounted to campaign platforms for their heirs.
 Unlike Mr. Reagan and Mr. Clinton, whose vice presidents sought to succeed them, Mr. Bush spoke on Monday with no obvious heir. And while he has pledged to support his party's eventual nominee, Republican candidates can barely bring themselves to invoke his name on the campaign trail. 
 Mr. Bush's approval rating hovers at 29 percent, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll. It has fallen with each State of the Union message since his first, delivered after Sept. 11, 2001, when Al Qaeda had been routed with the Taliban in Afghanistan and 82 percent approved of his handling of the job. Afghanistan, too, appeared to remain unfinished business; Mr. Bush noted the recent decision to send 3,200 Marines to bolster the American-led coalition against a resurgent Taliban.
 And though he declared that the state of the union would remain strong, as tradition obliges presidents to do, only 19 percent of Americans think the country is generally on the right track, as low a number as any recorded. 
 ''From expanding opportunity to protecting our country, we have made good progress,'' Mr. Bush said, appealing for a bipartisanship that has largely eluded the country during his presidency. ''Yet we have unfinished business before us, and the American people expect us to get it done.''

HEADLINE: Commodities Markets in New York and Chicago Discuss Merger

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. de la MERCED

 BODY:
The CME Group, which owns the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and Nymex Holdings, the owner of the New York Mercantile Exchange, said Monday that they were in talks about an $11 billion merger. 
 A union of the commodities markets, the largest in the United States, would be the latest combination in a wave of consolidation among financial markets. It would give CME, the world's largest market for derivatives trading, a major presence in energy trading.
 It may also lead to a flurry of rival bids for Nymex, whose longtime lead in energy and metals dealing has been challenged by newer rivals.
 In the last two years, stock exchanges have competed to build economies of scale by striking deals at home and abroad. Nearly $53 billion in exchange-related mergers have taken place since 2006, according to data from Dealogic. CME itself is the product of an $11.7 billion merger in July of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade. 
 In what the two commodities markets said was a 30-day exclusive negotiating period, they are discussing a takeover of Nymex by CME. The Chicago exchange would pay $36 in cash and 0.1323 share for each Nymex share, or about $119.22 based on Friday's closing price. That is an 11 percent premium over the Nymex closing share price of $107.16 on Friday.
 Shares in Nymex rose $9.34 on Monday, or 8.7 percent, closing at $116.50. CME declined $4, to $625.
 CME would keep Nymex's trading floors in Lower Manhattan. It might also buy back Nymex's 816 memberships for a maximum of $500 million.
 Both exchanges said that the discussions were in an early stage and that any final deal might differ from those terms.
 Nymex executives have long been open to a deal. The exchange's chairman, Richard Schaeffer, said last year that it was talking with potential suitors. Last month, Mr. Schaeffer said it was not in negotiations with NYSE Euronext, parent company of the New York Stock Exchange.
 But that left open the possibility of talks with rivals like CME. The two companies would be a natural fit. In 2006, Nymex struck a deal to list its energy futures and options contracts on CME's Globex electronic exchange, rather than on its own smaller system.
 One challenge facing older markets like the Chicago Merc and Nymex has been increased competition from rivals offering more electronic trading, rather than the familiar open-outcry system of specialists shouting orders. 
 Among these is the Intercontinental Exchange, an Atlanta-based concern that bought the New York Board of Trade last year. The Intercontinental Exchange lost to the Merc for the Chicago Board of Trade, and some analysts speculate that it may bid for Nymex as well.

HEADLINE: Looking Anew At Campaign Cash And Elected Judges

BYLINE: By ADAM LIPTAK

 BODY:
Vernon Valentine Palmer, a law professor at Tulane University in New Orleans, could not understand how justices of the Louisiana Supreme Court could routinely hear cases involving people who had given them campaign contributions. It seemed to him a raw and simple conflict of interest.
 So he wrote polite letters to each of the seven justices, urging them to adopt a rule that would make disqualification mandatory in those cases. 
 Six months passed without a single response, and he wrote again. ''I used seven more stamps,'' he said, ''and I still got no reply.''
 Professor Palmer is a senior member of the Tulane law faculty and the director of its European legal studies program. He is not an expert on judicial ethics, but he knows a thing or two about the rule of law.
 Peeved, he decided to take a closer look at the Louisiana Supreme Court. He recruited John Levendis, an economics professor at Loyola University in New Orleans, to help with the statistics, along with a half-dozen law students to crunch numbers and code cases. Their conclusions, to be published next month in The Tulane Law Review, are not pretty.
 In nearly half of the cases they reviewed, over a 14-year period ended in 2006, a litigant or lawyer had contributed to at least one justice, sometimes recently and sometimes long before. On average, justices voted in favor of their contributors 65 percent of the time, and two of the justices did so 80 percent of the time.
 The conventional response to such findings is that they do not prove much. 
 Judges do not change their votes in response to contributions, the argument goes. Rather, contributors support judges whose legal philosophies they find congenial and, incidentally, sometimes benefit when their judges apply those philosophies in a principled and consistent way that just happens to benefit them.
 You may think that is a distinction without a difference, which is why you do not teach judicial ethics.
 Professor Palmer was, in any event, able to address that objection by asking several additional questions. 
 He looked first at cases in which no one involved in the lawsuit had ever made a contribution, before or after the suit was filed, to establish a baseline. Some judges tended to vote for plaintiffs, others for defendants.
 Justice John L. Weimer, for instance, was slightly pro-defendant in cases where neither side had given him contributions, voting for plaintiffs 47 percent of the time. But in cases where he received money from the defense side (or more money from the defense when both sides gave money), he voted for the plaintiffs only 25 percent of the time. In cases where the money from the plaintiffs' side dominated, on the other hand, he voted for the plaintiffs 90 percent of the time. That is quite a swing.
 ''It is the donation, not the underlying philosophical orientation, that appears to account for the voting outcome,'' Professor Palmer said.
 Larger contributions had larger effects, the study found. Justice Catherine D. Kimball was 30 percent more likely to vote for a defendant with each additional $1,000 donation. The effect was even more pronounced for Justice Weimer, who was 300 percent more likely to do so. 
 ''The greater the size of the contribution,'' Professor Palmer said, ''the greater the odds of favorable outcomes.''
 A similar study of the Ohio Supreme Court conducted by The New York Times in 2006 continues to echo in that state. It appeared about a year after an appeals court there threw out a $212 million jury verdict in a case involving a business dispute between two companies, and it caused the lawyers on the losing side to take a look at who had contributed to the campaign of the judge who wrote the decision. It turned out that the judge, William G. Batchelder, had received a lot of money from Robert Meyerson, the chief executive of the company on the winning side, the Telxon Corporation.
 The lawyers for the company on the losing side, Smart Media, asked for a rehearing and got one, sort of. In November, a substitute panel of appeals court judges refused to undo the earlier decision, saying there was no procedure to allow that. Judge Robert Nader, dissenting, could barely contain his disbelief, saying the initial decision was infected by ''approximately $1 million in contributions from a very financially interested individual'' to Judge Batchelder, a Republican, and to the local Republican Party.
 This was, Judge Nader wrote, ''a classic scenario giving rise to every nuance of political influence in our courts which calls for self-disqualification.''
 The case is now before the Ohio Supreme Court. Mr. Meyerson, the executive, has given money to two of its justices as well.
 A couple of weeks ago, the United States Supreme Courtsaid the Constitution had nothing to say about the way New York elects its judges. But several justices went out of their way to question the practice of electing judges. Justices Anthony M. Kennedy and Stephen G. Breyer said, for instance, that campaign fund-raising in judicial elections might be at odds ''with the perception and the reality of judicial independence and judicial excellence.''
 But you do not have to do away with elections and or even fund-raising to make a drastic improvement in the quality of justice in state courts around the nation. All you need to do is listen to Professor Palmer. If a judge has taken money from a litigant or a lawyer, Professor Palmer says, the judge has no business ruling on that person's case.

CORRECTION-DATE: September 20, 2008

 CORRECTION:
The Sidebar column on Jan. 29 reported on a study that examined campaign contributions to justices on the Louisiana Supreme Court. The study, published in The Tulane Law Review in March, found that contributions appeared to influence how the justices voted when cases that involved contributors came before the court.
 The law review recently posted a note on its Web site saying the study was based on flawed data that called its conclusions into question.
 Vernon Valentine Palmer, the study's principal author and a law professor at Tulane, acknowledged the errors, but said the corrected data appear to continue to support the study's general conclusions. He also said that he was seeking an independent review of the study.

HEADLINE: U.S. Markets Rally After Sell-Off Abroad

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM and DAVID JOLLY

 BODY:
An early tumble gave way to a rally on Wall Street on Monday, as investors shrugged off heavy losses in the Asian markets and sent stocks steadily up in the afternoon. 
 The Dow Jones industrials closed up 176 points and the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained almost 1.8 percent, led by a strong recovery among beaten-down financial stocks. Shares of JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America were up by more than 4 percent.
Investors were placing bets ahead of a two-day meeting of the Federal Reserve, which begins Tuesday. Market watchers expect the central bank to cut interest rates, but there is some debate over how much. 
 Futures markets are showing a higher probability that central bankers will cut its benchmark lending rate by half a percentage point, but market watchers have not ruled out the possibility of a quarter-point cut.
 Anticipation of a rate cut may have played a role in Monday's market gains.
 ''It's the undoing of Friday's decline,'' said Sam Stovall, a strategist at Standard & Poor's, referring to the 170-point drop in the Dow that capped off last week. ''People sold off on Friday thinking the Fed would not cut rates as much as people hoped.''
 Rate cuts tend to cheer investors, especially financial firms that hope a cut will make it easier to lend and receive money. But Mr. Stovall cautioned that ''it's a little too early to tell'' how the Fed will act. 
 Still, the expectation of a cut helped American markets brush off steep losses in Asian stocks amid lingering worries about banking sector debts and a slowdown in the United States economy. ''There is still fear in the market about write-downs from financial institutions,'' said Chicuong Dang, an analyst at Richelieu Finance in Paris. ''The sell-off in Asia is evidence that the fear is everywhere.''
 European stocks initially slid as well, as shares of Societe Generale dropped almost 4 percent. Societe Generale bank found itself in unwanted headlines last week after revelations of trading fraud, and analysts at Citigroup downgraded their rating on the share to sell from buy. 
 Stocks slipped less than 1 percent at the opening on Wall Street, shaken in part by a rocky start for McDonald's, which fell more than 5 percent after it said sales at its American hamburger stores were flat in December. A grim report on new-home sales in December, which fell to their slowest pace in 13 years, shook investors' confidence as well; the Dow fell sharply moments after the report's release at 10 a.m. 
 Even so, stocks recovered within the first hour and went on to enjoy a generally positive afternoon session. The Dow closed up 176.72 points, or 1.5 percent, at 12,383.89. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index gained 1 percent, and the S.& P. rallied by 1.8 percent, or 23.35 points, to finish at 1,353.96.
 The gains were a contrast to the market upheaval that began the week in Asia. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 stock average fell 4 percent on Monday. The decline took the Japanese benchmark index down more than 14 percent for the month of January.
 The Hang Seng index fell 4.3 percent. The Hong Kong benchmark has been among the most volatile of the world's major indexes in recent weeks, gaining as much as 11 percent in one day and losing as much as 8.7 percent on another.
 Mainland Chinese stocks were also weaker, with the CSI 300 index falling 7 percent.
 Investors also adopted a more cautious view of the Federal Reserve's intentions. The Fed was expected to follow up last week's 3/4-point rate cut with another cut Wednesday.
 Government bond prices declined as stocks jumped. The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 5/32 to 105 16/32. Its yield, which moves opposite its price, rose to 3.58 percent, from 3.56 percent.
 Following are the results of Monday's two-year Treasury notes and three- and six-month notes:

HEADLINE: The Tug of War for America's Heart

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Obama Carries South Carolina by Wide Margin'' (front page, Jan. 27):
 Propelled by South Carolina's winning results, Senator Barack Obama is even with Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton at two and two in contested early-voting states, and the Democratic Party's nomination race is now headed toward an exciting finish. 
 This forceful fight between the two most eligible presidential contenders can become more spirited if both candidates focus on thrashing out the core issues confronting our country and refrain from making any personal attacks and unwarranted and unfounded criticism. 
 If this is adopted as the unwritten code of conduct for all elections, the voters will have an opportunity to make a well-informed decision based on the candidates' merits and vision for America's betterment, notwithstanding any race or gender factor.
 After all, endorsing the right candidate and hoping the best for America and its people will in fact be every voter's own self-introspection test in the primaries as well in the national balloting.

 To the Editor:
 Bingo! In ''A President Like My Father'' (Op-Ed, Jan. 27), Caroline Kennedy got it exactly right.
 In February 1963, I entered the Peace Corps, eager to serve my president and the ideals of my country in a remote mountain village in Colombia. There, a world away, villagers knew about, admired, respected and even loved John F. Kennedy, one couple naming their newborn son John Kennedy Muelas. 
 Later, as a college professor for 35 years, I somewhat nostalgically displayed President Kennedy's picture in my office, but his image was also a reminder that no occupant of the White House has been nearly so inspirational since Nov. 22, 1963.
 Now we have Barack Obama, and as I sense so strongly that the old power to inspire is back, I realize how important it is, not only for our country, but also for the whole world. Thank you, Caroline, for saying it so well.

 To the Editor:
 Caroline Kennedy states that she is supporting Senator Barack Obama, because he, like her father, will get us to ''believe in ourselves'' and make us feel ''inspired and hopeful.'' That is all well and good, but the reality is that, while he was inspirational, the verdict on her father's short presidency is very mixed.
 He fell into the debacle of the Bay of Pigs, escalated the Vietnam War and, fortunately for him, did not receive any press scrutiny on his ties to organized crime as well as his excessive extramarital dalliances in the White House.
 While it is great to be inspired, our times also call for competence, leadership and substantive experience to bring about the real changes toward universal health care, fiscal responsibility, environmental stewardship and so much more that will make us truly ''believe in ourselves.'' The candidate who can best bring that to fruition is Hillary Rodham Clinton. Maggie Atwood

 My first time voting was for Caroline Kennedy's father, John F. Kennedy. He was the candidate for many of us enthusiastic youth in the days when we believed that this was our country and that those of us in it could do wonders together with strong leadership. 
 Under Kennedy's presidency we were inspired to hope and to believe and to work. We were privileged to experience his leadership. We have been cheated of that inspiration by his death and subsequent presidents. 
 I am 68 years old, and though disappointed and in mourning for that loss, I am once again filled with the charged enthusiasm and hope that Caroline expresses. Mary Jo Olsen

 Caroline Kennedy's moving endorsement of Senator Barack Obama highlights what I feel is the most important thing any leader does: Set a tone. A great leader inspires and appeals to our highest ideals, our hopes and our dreams. A great leader brings us together and helps us to see the good in one another. 
 The Bush administration has spent seven years stirring up our fear and intolerance, weakening our Constitution, our social fabric, our economy, our civil liberties and our reputation abroad in the process. Let's be great again, America! Margaret Caldwell

 Re ''Questions for the Clintons,'' by Bob Herbert (column, Jan. 26): Mr. Herbert took a piece of a complimentary statement I made about Senator Barack Obama's being qualified to be president, imputed that my motive was to ''slime'' the senator, sandwiched a few of my words between a statement by Andrew Young and a vile anonymous Internet posting, and rested his case.
 Though I am generally not surprised by this technique, as a regular reader of Mr. Herbert, I was surprised by his use of the device. I attribute this to the passions this campaign has aroused.
 This letter is written to restate my compliment of Senator Obama.
 If he becomes president of the United States, his experience will give him the capacity to undo much of the damage we have done to our standing in Muslim communities without weakening our resolve to keep ourselves safe from terrorist Islamic groups. Bob Kerrey

 To the Editor:
 Thanks to Bob Herbert for questioning the Clinton campaign. It has become obvious to me that the Clintons view the American public only as potential voters, and not as fellow citizens. While they continue to insist that political spin and negative tactics are all just in ''fun,'' the Clintons consistently and dangerously ignore the devastating material effects of their efforts. 
 As a college student growing up during the Bush-Clinton era, I have been forced to live within the wreckage of such divisiveness, learning to expect nothing but incompetence from government and complacency from citizens. Thank goodness for Barack Obama, who has encouraged my generation not only to go out and vote, but also to believe that government can play a role in uplifting its people. 
 Thanks to his campaign, I now know what true political leadership looks like -- and it does not look like Hillary Rodham Clinton. Leslie Allison

HEADLINE: Eating Meat: Is It Killing Us, and the Planet?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Rethinking the Meat-Guzzler'' (Week in Review, Jan. 27):
 Mark Bittman answered my prayers by writing an article exposing how the meat industry contributes to global warming, world hunger and other issues plaguing our world. But there is indeed a simple answer to these problems: Go vegan. 
 Elaine Sloan New York, Jan. 28, 2008
 To the Editor:
 ''Rethinking the Meat-Guzzler'' suggests a reduction in meat consumption by every citizen as a way to reduce pollution and dependence on foreign oil and ignores the developing evidence that genetics dictate the appropriate quantities of meat consumption for healthy living for each individual and the recent evidence that dietary cholesterol may not, in fact, be the cause of disease. 
 The ''one size fits all'' diet championed by Mark Bittman is what needs more reanalysis. 
 All those who care about proper nutrition must look at the developing science, which may suggest that diet should be customized: some may need to decrease their consumption of grains and increase their consumption of meat.
 But much more attention and discussion needs to be directed to the meat industry, particularly its barbaric treatment of the helpless animals that are in our servitude. 
 Brian O'Reilly Montclair, N.J., Jan. 27, 2008
 To the Editor:
 The majority of people do not understand what society is causing because of our appetite for meat in every meal. Whatever happened to the Sunday supper, while every other day is potato stew or corn chowder? Having a roast or baked chicken used to be for special occasions. 
 We have become the pigs, and we are paying the price with our health. We reap what we sow. 
 Michelle Gordon Gulfport, Miss., Jan. 27, 2008
 To the Editor:
 ''Rethinking the Meat-Guzzler'' was misguided. Raising livestock is the best use of most pasture land, not growing crops. Animals turn grass, a k a sunlight, into high-quality proteins, minerals and fats that are an ideal food for humans. Meat is an excellent source of food and far higher quality than just plants.
 We are evolved to eat meat -- it is right and natural. What is wrong is factory farms. Do not confuse the garbage output of confinement animal feeding operations with healthy meat. CAFOs are unsustainable, as noted in the article, but there is an excellent alternative. Buy locally raised pastured meats from farmers in your area. Ask for local foods at your stores, and when you can, deal directly with the farmers so more of your money flows into your local economy and supports local farmers.

HEADLINE: Fed's Issue On Rates: How Low?

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Having stunned investors one week ago by unexpectedly slashing short-term interest rates, the Federal Reserve appears poised to announce another rate cut on Wednesday as insurance against a recession.
 But policy makers face difficult questions about how deep to cut rates, given that a recession has yet to materialize and that inflation pressures remain a nagging concern in the background.
 On Wall Street, where the clamor about a recession remains at a fever pitch, investors are betting heavily that the central bank will lower the overnight federal funds rate by an additional half a percentage point, to 3 percent. 
 That decrease would come on top of last week's surprise reduction of three-quarters of a percentage point, and could set the stage for lower interest rates on home equity loans, car loans and business lending.
 But the outcome of the meeting is far from certain. While recent data on the housing market and retail sales has reinforced the impression of a stalling economy, economists were surprised on Tuesday by an unexpectedly strong jump in orders for durable goods in December. 
 The Commerce Department reported that orders for all durable goods -- big-ticket items like commercial aircraft and auto parts -- jumped 5.2 percent last month. Excluding orders for transportation goods, which are volatile from month to month, orders climbed 2.6 percent, the first increase since September.
 Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, and other Fed officials are already under fire from two directions. Many analysts on Wall Street complain that the central bank has moved too slowly in response to signs of a faltering economy. They point to a plunge in housing that does not seem to have hit bottom, slowing growth in retail sales and tight credit.
 But a significant minority of economists argue that policy makers have let themselves be unnecessarily alarmed by panicky swings in the stock market. If the central bank props up the economy with easy money, they warn, the result will be higher inflation in the future.
 Richard DeKaser, chief economist at the National City Corporation, a Cleveland bank, is skeptical that the economy is headed for a recession, despite the common assumption that it is. ''Few seem to take seriously the prospect that we are not going into a recession,'' said Mr. DeKaser, who cites the latest labor market data, showing fewer weekly claims for unemployment benefits and encouraging layoff numbers, which suggest to him that the nation has added a hefty number of jobs in January. 
 And despite the huge losses and write-offs stemming from subprime mortgages, he added, business borrowers have yet to face a credit squeeze. 
 Members of the central bank's Federal Open Market Committee, which decides interest rates, have shown clear signs of disagreement among themselves.
 At the meeting last week, conducted by videoconference, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, William Poole, voted against any rate cut. The committee's previous rate cut, in December, a quarter-point cut to 3.5 percent, provoked a dissent from another member, the president of the Boston Fed, Eric S. Rosengren. He wanted a bigger reduction.
 Fed officials acknowledged this month that they had lowered their forecasts for economic growth this year, even though their previous forecast had already assumed a slowdown in the first half of this year. 
 Mr. Bernanke acknowledged on Jan. 10 that the housing market was still in a free fall and that the turmoil in subprime mortgage markets had shaken the broader credit markets. 
 Warning that financial markets were ''fragile'' and that the labor market appeared to be weakening, Mr. Bernanke bluntly declared that ''additional policy easing may be necessary'' and that the Fed stood ready to take ''substantive additional action.''
 When the Fed surprised investors by cutting its overnight rate at an unscheduled meeting on Jan. 22, officials left little doubt that they would lower the rate yet again at their regularly scheduled two-day policy meeting this Tuesday and Wednesday.
 To the extent that investors remain fearful about credit risks, markets for mortgage-backed securities are likely to remain dysfunctional and banks will be forced to write down even more of their loan portfolios. That could aggravate a broader credit problem, which in turn could slow investment and economic activity.
 But analysts say Mr. Bernanke faces a difficult challenge in trying to manage expectations. On the one hand, they say, the Fed wants to act decisively enough to reassure investors and the public that it will prevent the economy from sinking. On the other hand, they say, Mr. Bernanke does not want to be seen as panicking in response to a plunge in the stock market.
 Fed officials say they have changed their outlook primarily because of considerably grimmer economic data over the past month. Net job creation almost stopped in December, and unemployment jumped to 5 percent, from 4.7 percent. 
 Mr. Bernanke made it clear in his speech on Jan. 10 that the Fed was paying particular attention to the housing market, and the recent data had been unremittingly bad. New-home sales in December dropped 4.7 percent, to an annualized rate of 604,000 units -- down 41 percent from a year earlier and the lowest level in 13 years. 
 On Tuesday, Standard & Poor's, the bond ratings agency, reported that its S.& P./Case-Shiller index of home prices dropped at a record rate in November. The index for 10 major metropolitan areas was down 8.4 percent from a year earlier.

CORRECTION-DATE: January 31, 2008

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Wednesday about the difficulties facing the Federal Reserve misstated the federal funds rate after the Fed's policy-making committee made a quarter-point cut in December. It was 4.25 percent, not 3.5 percent. (The Fed's three-quarter-point cut last week reduced the rate to 3.5 percent.)

HEADLINE: White House Criticizes Envoy Over Iran

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
White House officials expressed anger on Tuesday about an appearance in which the United States ambassador to the United Nations, Zalmay Khalilzad, sat beside the Iranian foreign minister at a panel of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Saturday.
 The United States does not have diplomatic relations with Iran, and the Bush administration has limited its official high-level dealings with Iran to discussions about Iraq, primarily in Baghdad. Administration officials said that Mr. Khalilzad's appearance beside Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki in Davos at a panel on Iranian foreign policy surprised senior Bush administration officials, who became aware that Mr. Khalilzad had appeared with Mr. Mottaki only when a video of the discussion appeared on YouTube on Tuesday. 
 Mr. Khalilzad was still in Europe and could not be reached for comment. His spokesman, Richard A. Grenell, characterized Mr. Khalilzad's appearance beside Mr. Mottaki as ''just a multilateral conversation with the moderator.''
 ''There was no separate meeting or separate conversation or handshake with the Iranian foreign minister,'' Mr. Grenell said. But administration officials said that White House officials, in particular, were angry about the episode. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about internal administration affairs. 
 The in-fighting reflects continuing disagreements within the Bush administration about how to deal with Iran, and just where to draw the line on engaging its nemesis, particularly when the administration's Iran policy appears to be in disarray. Many State Department officials say privately that they think the administration should directly engage Iran, and without preconditions, a view that is not shared by the White House.
 In his State of the Union address on Monday night, President Bush repeated his customary tough rhetoric against Iran. ''Verifiably suspend your nuclear enrichment, so negotiations can begin,'' he said. ''Come clean about your nuclear intentions and past actions.''
 But European diplomats and even a handful of people in the administration say a lack of progress in American-led efforts to intensify sanctions against Iran suggests that Mr. Bush is unlikely to achieve his goal of getting Iran to abandon its nuclear ambitions before he leaves office.
 Mr. Bush's top envoy to the sanctions talks, R. Nicholas Burns, the under secretary of state for political affairs, announced last week that he was resigning. Mr. Burns has maintained that his departure has nothing to do with dwindling hope that the administration will get much traction in its diplomatic efforts to press Iran to halt its uranium enrichment program. 
 Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice quickly moved to replace Mr. Burns with an equally respected career foreign service official, William J. Burns, the United States ambassador to Russia. (The two men are not related.)
 But ''it's hard to see Nick Burns jumping ship if they thought they were going to get somewhere on the diplomatic track,'' one European diplomat said. 
 Last week, American and European diplomats circulated draft copies of a third United Nations Security Council sanctions resolution against Tehran, which is meant to increase pressure on Iran's leadership by making it harder for anyone involved in Iran's nuclear program to do business around the world.
 The new sanctions resolution would, for the first time, authorize inspections of air and sea cargo going in and out of Iran. Also, it would ban all trade and supply of dual-use items, materials and technologies that can have both civilian and military uses. 
 Publicly, administration officials say the resolution shows that a group that includes Britain, Russia, China, Germany, France and the United States remains united in maintaining pressure on Iran.
 But the resolution is far weaker than what the United States, Britain and France were seeking, and officials say their efforts to win support from Russia and China have been undercut by the release in Washington in December of a National Intelligence Estimate that said Iran had abandoned its nuclear arms program.
 In negotiations over the resolution, diplomats said, Russia and China insisted that it merely call on countries to ''exercise vigilance'' over the activities of financial institutions connected to some Iranian banks, instead of an outright ban on transactions with those banks.
 The intelligence estimate ''does hurt in that it furthers the view in most of the world that it's a question of cleaning up Iran's past record, and that after that, everything's done,'' said George Perkovich of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ''I don't see what the administration can do to change that scenario. This resolution will be the something that's just a little more than nothing.''
 Indeed, Bush administration officials have recently been on the defensive in trying to demonstrate why the rest of the world should continue to increase the pressure on Iran. 
 At the forum in Davos on Saturday, Mr. Khalilzad, seated next to Mr. Mottaki, defended the American stance that pressure should be maintained against Iran until Tehran agrees to suspend its uranium enrichment. 
 ''It hasn't been a brilliantly successful strategy so far,'' said Gareth Evans of the International Crisis Group, the panel's moderator, expressing support for an idea increasingly winning favor in Europe, one that would allow Iran to enrich uranium but only with stronger international monitoring and safeguards.
 Mr. Khalilzad stuck to the administration playbook. ''Imagine if you acquiesce to that, why would others not seek similar capabilities?'' he said. ''You'd have a world where a number of countries are within so many hours, so many weeks, of nuclear capability.''

HEADLINE: In Santana Duel, Mets Are Left Standing

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
All winter, the experts said the Mets didn't have a chance, and all winter, the Mets' general manager quietly and confidently said he would be the last one standing when the Minnesota Twins traded Johan Santana. The Twins traded Santana on Tuesday, and look who got him.
 Santana has to pass a physical, and the Mets have to satisfy his expensive taste in salary before the deal is completed. But barring an unforeseen problem with his remarkable left arm, Santana will officially become the No. 1 pitcher in the Mets' rotation by 5 p.m. Friday, the end of a 72-hour window the commissioner's office has granted him and the Mets to negotiate a contract. 
 The Mets need to negotiate a contract extension that will induce Santana to waive the no-trade clause in his existing contract. That is not expected to be an issue. 
 It's not my money, so it's easy for me to say, but the Mets should not hesitate to give Santana what he wants to waive the clause. The Mets or someone else -- pronounce that Yankees -- would give Santana the money next fall when he could be a free agent, so why not give it to him now?
 Ideally he wants $25 million a year for six or seven years, and a signing bonus that will supplement his 2008 salary of $13.25 million, a total economic package of more than $160 million, the largest ever for a pitcher. Maybe the Mets will be able to sign him for a few dollars less, but economics will not kill the deal. 
 If it sounds like a lot of money, it is. But a year ago, the San Francisco Giants gave Barry Zito $126 million for seven years, and he did not have Santana's credentials. Zito demonstrated that difference by compiling an 11-13 record and a 4.53 earned run average last season.
 The Mets passed on Zito because they did not want to give him a seven-year contract. They will try to keep Santana at six years, but if they have to go to seven, they will at least know they are giving a seven-year contract to a two-time Cy Young award winner.
 Except for Roger Clemens and steroids, Santana, who will be 29 on opening day, has dominated baseball talk this off-season. Earlier in the winter, the big money was on the Yankees or the Red Sox getting him. The Mets were dismissed. Not enough good young prospects to satisfy the Twins, the explanation went.
 The Mets' general manager, Omar Minaya, was not deterred by the talk. But he did not talk, either. He resisted the temptation to shout to the baseball world, ''Hey, I'm a player in this game, too.''
 Silence, he felt, was the wiser way to go. If Hank Steinbrenner wanted to give weekly updates on the Yankees' interest in Santana, that was his prerogative. Minaya would say nothing.
 He said so little, in fact, that many people believed the Mets weren't even in the scamper for Santana. It takes great patience and discipline to play Minaya's game, and he played it well.
 The Yankees were divided in their desire for Santana. Steinbrenner wanted him; General Manager Brian Cashman did not, not at the expense of one or more of the team's young pitchers. As the winter wore on, Cashman wore down Steinbrenner, who eventually saw the wisdom of his thinking.
 Hal Steinbrenner, the other son of George, also didn't like the idea of adding a large Santana salary to an already exploding payroll.
 The Red Sox stayed in the running as long as the Yankees were in it, but they liked their corps of starting pitchers and didn't like the idea of adding a large Santana salary to their payroll. 
 It became obvious to the Twins that they were losing two of their three potential trading partners. But that's the way Minaya had it figured all along. He just didn't talk about his view of the trade talks. 
 Throughout Hank Steinbrenner's repeated public comments about his desire to get Santana, and throughout the Red Sox' talk of offering pitcher Jon Lester or outfielder Jacoby Ellsbury, but not both, the mute Minaya lurked in the background. 
 As he silently stalked Santana, Minaya heard Mets fans implore him to get a pitcher. Pedro Martinez was coming back, but Tom Glavine had gone back to Atlanta.
 Martinez, Orlando Hernandez, John Maine, Oliver Perez, Mike Pelfrey -- how could they be enough to make fans forget the Mets' September swoon?
 The bitter taste of that classic collapse remained. Mets fans could think of nothing else. Without a frontline starting pitcher, they fretted, how could the team atone for the fiasco that ended last season?
 The fans need fret no more. Like Mighty Mouse, Santana is coming to save the day. Minaya, responding to the fans' urgent cries, had said all along that the Mets would have enough starting pitching. He just had not told them what he had in mind.

HEADLINE: Good Times for Some

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 ''Worries That the Good Times Were a Mirage'' (Economic Scene, front page, Jan. 23) peered past the real-world economic realities that millions of Americans see all too well with their own eyes. While it may be accepted wisdom that the American economy has been in much better shape lately than it was in the past, the fact is that there are more Americans living in poverty today than during the last official recession in 2001. 
 Over the last seven years, nearly five million Americans slipped out of the middle class and into poverty; median household income for working-age Americans declined by nearly $2,500; 8.6 million Americans lost their health insurance; three million manufacturing jobs disappeared; and more than three million workers lost their pensions. 
 True, some of the richest Americans have not had it so good since the Roaring Twenties. But while the wealthiest .01 percent realized an average one-year increase in their income of $4.4 million from 2004-5, the bottom 90 percent of Americans saw their average income decline by $172. 
 While stock market gyrations have caused the White House and mainstream media to pay more attention to the economy lately, we must look beyond the canyons of Wall Street to the rest of America where 37 million Americans live in poverty; 47 million Americans lack health insurance, and 36 million Americans struggle to put food on the table. 
 The current economic crisis will not end when the stock market steadies itself if wages for regular people continue to fall and the middle class continues to shrink. Sadly, that is no mirage.

HEADLINE: New Rules to Help Smaller Companies Raise Funds

BYLINE: By BRENT BOWERS

 BODY:
Federal regulators are about to ease rules that have made it difficult for small and medium-size publicly traded companies to raise money. The changes, experts say, are well timed, given the tightening credit market.
 The revisions in the Securities and Exchange Commission's Rule 144, which governs the sale of so-called restricted securities, affect companies with annual revenues of less than $700 million, and take effect on Feb. 15.
 Restricted securities are shares or bonds sold in private placements, usually at a discount of about 10 percent from the market price; the securities cannot be registered immediately with the S.E.C. Under current rules, investors must wait one year to sell, and then usually only in stages of a specified number each quarter for the year after that. 
 Under the changes, which were approved by the commission on Nov. 15 and are retroactive, the investors must wait only six months to sell the securities, and can part with them all at once.
 ''The changes will likely make private placements by smaller publicly traded companies much more attractive to investors,'' said David Danovitch, a partner at the Manhattan law firm of Gersten Savage who specializes in securities laws. ''When the credit markets tighten, people run to the equity markets, and now it should be easier for companies that are starved for cash to tap into them.''
 Two years ago, Mr. Danovitch said, the S.E.C. relaxed the rules governing registration statements filed by publicly traded companies with a market capitalization of $700 million or more to give them better access to the capital markets. Now, he said, it is extending the benefits to smaller companies.
 Investors will also gain a greater degree of liquidity and thus a better chance of making a profit.
 ''Smaller businesses are a critical part of our nation's economy,'' the chairman of the S.E.C., Christopher Cox, said in November in announcing the unanimous vote to make the amendments. He added that the new rules would ''make it more efficient for companies of all sizes to access the private markets.''
 One entrepreneur who is delighted with the changes is Ian Warwick, chief executive of the Aftersoft Group, a $28 million maker of software for car repair shops, car parts distributors and other car-related businesses.
 Aftersoft originated in Britain but entered the American market in the early 1990s and is now seeking to expand. It is No. 1 in Britain, with 68 percent of the automotive software aftermarket, as it is called, and is hoping to achieve the same status in the United States within two years. It now holds a 12 percent share.
 Mr. Warwick said his company's software could be used in other industries as well. ''We could expand to the lumber industry, the plumbing industry -- the possibilities are endless,'' he said. ''We have a very aggressive growth plan.''
 To achieve his ambitions, though, Mr. Warwick, 48, needs to raise money. ''We spent the better part of last year raising funds,'' he said. ''It would have been a much quicker and more efficient process if the new rules had been in effect.'' 
 He said he expected to go back into the market late next year. Before doing a private placement, he says, he wants to get Aftersoft's stock price up to $2, from about 30 cents a share today. If he succeeds in increasing the stock price, he will seek to raise equity to do a spate of acquisitions, perhaps shooting for as much as $100 million if he decides to make a takeover bid for his major competitor, a company called Activant Solutions Inc.
 The global effect of the looser S.E.C. standards is anybody's guess at this early stage. Brian Overstreet, president of Sagient Research Systems in San Diego, said its PlacementTracker service found that the number of deals involving private investment in public equity stabilized last year at 1,378, compared with 1,343 in 2006. 
 The funds raised, however, surged to $81.5 billion from $28.3 billion. He attributed about $40 billion of the increase to a frenzy of transactions by big investment banks in the last four months of 2007, aimed at resolving their subprime woes. Even taking that factor out the equation, though, he said, an increase to $41 billion from $28 billion was significant.
 He cautioned, however, that most of those deals were made under different and more investor-friendly terms than those of Rule 144, and thus were not a barometer of future 144 activity. Still, he said, the changes approved by the S.E.C. were bound to prompt more small companies to turn to the rule.
 People are just starting to price deals under the new regulations, according to Mr. Danovitch of Gersten Savage. And while the change will make it easier for small-capitalization companies to gain access to the capital markets on more favorable terms, it is not clear yet how much more money will flow to them.
 ''I'd say the companies that will benefit the most from the changes are those with a market cap of less than $100 million,'' Mr. Danovitch said.

HEADLINE: Durable Goods Orders Jump; Consumer Outlook Sags

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Orders to factories for big-ticket manufactured goods jumped unexpectedly in December, good news amid signs that the economy may be tipping toward a recession.
 Still, analysts said the 5.2 percent growth in orders, while it might bolster industrial output in coming months, probably reflected overseas demand. Domestic growth, they said, faces continuing threats from tight credit and mortgage markets that have forced consumers to retrench. 
 The Conference Board reported Tuesday that consumer confidence fell sharply in January on worries over deteriorating business conditions and a weakening job market.
 The board's consumer confidence index dropped to 87.9 in January, from a revised 90.6 in December. That put it back about where it was in November, when it registered 87.8. The January reading was just below the 88 expected by Wall Street analysts, according to Thomson/IFR.
 While acknowledging that the factory orders report, released Tuesday by the Commerce Department, was a positive sign, economists worried that it would be misinterpreted as signaling greater strength than exists.
 ''The U.S. economy remains under severe stress,'' Bernard Baumohl, managing director of the Economic Outlook Group, wrote in a research note, saying ''the prospects of a recession are still very real.''
 Lynn Franco, director of the Conference Board Consumer Research Center, said in a statement that the consumer confidence survey -- based on a sample of 5,000 American households -- indicated that consumers appeared more pessimistic about the economy in January.
 The survey was taken, however, before the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut of three-quarters of a percentage point on Jan. 22 and last week's announcement by the White House and Congress that they would work on an economic stimulus program. Both are aimed at bolstering consumer spending.
 The strength in durable goods orders -- double what analysts had expected -- came from a big increase in demand for commercial aircraft. But even excluding the transportation sector, orders posted a solid 2.6 percent gain.
 Despite the strong December, it was a lackluster year. Orders for all of 2007 rose just 0.97 percent after increases of 6.31 percent in 2006 and 9.45 percent in 2005. It was the poorest showing since 2002, when orders fell by 3.17 percent. In that year the country was still struggling to emerge from the 2001 recession.

HEADLINE: Yahoo to Cut 1,000 Jobs, And Warns on Growth

BYLINE: By MIGUEL HELFT

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
After announcing a sharp drop in fourth-quarter profits Tuesday, Yahoo issued a disappointing outlook for this year, suggesting that investors would have to wait until 2009 for a turnaround. 
 Yahoo also said that as part of its plan to revive its fortunes, it would cut 1,000 jobs by mid-February to reduce costs and narrow its focus to its most important businesses. 
 The company, however, said it planned to invest aggressively in some areas, like advertising technology and selected portions of its Internet portal, as it tries to capture a larger share of online ad dollars. Since some laid-off employees could apply for new jobs at Yahoo, the net effect on the work force, which recently grew to 14,300, was not clear. 
 Jerry Yang, the chief executive, warned investors of ''head winds'' this year. Yahoo's projections for revenue growth and profitability in 2008 were either at the low end of analysts' expectations or below them.
 Yahoo executives said those projections were largely independent of the slowdown in the United States economy, noting that it was too early to predict whether weakness in the financial, travel and housing sectors would hurt online advertising. 
 ''There is not a lot of positive about the outlook,'' said John Aiken, an analyst with Majestic Research, an investment analysis firm in New York.
 In a sign of growing impatience, investors reacted negatively to the announcements, which were made in a conference call after the markets closed. In after-hours trading, Yahoo shares fell more than 10 percent, to levels of more than three years ago. 
 Yahoo said that its fourth-quarter net income fell to $206 million, or 15 cents a share, down 23 percent from $269 million, or 19 cents a share, in the same quarter a year ago. Revenue grew 8 percent to $1.8 billion. Excluding commissions paid to certain advertising partners, revenue was $1.4 billion, in line with analysts' expectations.
 Mr. Yang, the Yahoo co-founder who was named chief executive last summer amid growing shareholder discontent, has promised to focus on three objectives: becoming a starting point for consumers on the Web; making the company a top choice for marketers seeking to place ads on sites across the Web; and opening Yahoo's technology infrastructure to third-party programmers and publishers. 
 It is a strategy that will require time and investments. Yet Mr. Yang said he was upbeat. ''We are seeing early signs of success as a result of this clear new focus,'' he said. 
 Yahoo has begun narrowing the focus of its portal on a few key areas, including its front page, the personalized home page service MyYahoo, search, mail, and properties like news, finance and sports. 
 Improvements to those services has led to double-digit increases in visits to Yahoo, said Susan Decker, Yahoo's president. Meanwhile, the company has said it would de-emphasize or shut down a number of other services, including photos, podcasts and a largely unsuccessful social network. 
 Ms. Decker also said that Yahoo had begun to make investments to revamp its advertising and search technology infrastructure, which would allow the company to be more efficient. 
 Yahoo needs to make some of those investments as it tries to become the seller of ads on a network of Web publishers, which for now includes eBay, Comcast, hundreds of newspapers and others. Some analysts said the plans made sense, but questioned whether the changes could translate into financial gains quickly enough. 
 ''How long does all of this take?'' asked Christa Quarles, an analyst with Thomas Weisel Partners. ''How long does the board stay satisfied? How long does it take to grow the publisher network? Yahoo's problems didn't start in 2007; they started in 2003.''
 Yahoo also said that it renegotiated and expanded a lucrative partnership with AT&T. Instead of receiving fees for each broadband customer AT&T signs up, Yahoo will share search and display advertising revenue with AT&T. Under the four-year deal, Yahoo's search technology will also be available to AT&T's cellphone customers. 
 The deal will result in upfront payments from AT&T to Yahoo for $300 million to $400 million, which will be recognized over the length of the agreement. Yahoo executives said that the deal would result in a net revenue loss this year, but that it stood to make more money over the life of the agreement. 
 Yahoo also said Tuesday that it had appointed Aristotle Balogh, 43, known as Ari, as chief technology officer, a crucial post vacant since Farzad Nazem left months ago. Mr. Balogh had been chief technology officer at the online security firm VeriSign.

HEADLINE: A Befuddlement Of Liquor Laws

BYLINE: By ERIC ASIMOV

 BODY:
I have a confession to make. I am a lawbreaker. 
 It happened only once. Well, maybe a few times, since I'm being honest. Naturally, it involved wine that I really wanted but that I could not obtain either from a retail shop in New York City or directly from a winery. But I found these bottles online at a retail shop in California. I ordered the wine and it was shipped to me.
 That's illegal. At least it is in New York State. I think. Since 2005, it's been legal to order directly from wineries. But as far as retail shops go, it's not always so easy to know for sure. 
 The laws governing direct interstate shipments from wine retailers to consumers are confusing, arcane, inconsistent, often ignored and rarely discussed. The topic comes up now because of the efforts of one online wine merchant, Wine.com, to squelch fellow merchants it suspected of breaking the laws by which it says it was abiding. 
 In what amounted to its own sting operation, Wine.com last summer ordered wine from several retail merchants and asked them to ship it to states where such shipments are illegal. Upon receiving the wine, Wine.com then sent letters to state regulators turning in the transgressors. 
 In a business composed largely of old acquaintances with a nod-and-wink attitude toward shipping laws, it was the equivalent of turning in your neighbor for double-parking. The sting was disclosed in December by Richard Cartiere's Wine Market Report, a trade publication, and as consumers became aware of it this month they filled wine blogs and bulletin boards with anger and consternation, mostly directed at Wine.com but also at the tangle of laws that makes it so difficult to get sought-after wines. 
 The attention illuminates the tensions inherent in an Internet economy bound by post-Prohibition laws that created the three-tier system of producers, distributors and retailers, regulated on a state-by-state basis.
 ''Our beef was not with anyone other than the laws themselves,'' said Rich Bergsund, the chief executive of Wine.com. ''We think it's critical to abide by them while we change them because our industry has to demonstrate it's responsible enough to handle free trade.''
 Free trade, subject to the normal rules of selling alcoholic beverages but unrestricted by state borders, is the aim of Web merchants like Wine.com as well as big bricks-and-mortar stores that have developed lucrative online divisions. But it is difficult to know what constitutes legal. 
 According to New York laws, for example, out-of-state retailers cannot sell to consumers in New York unless that retailer has a retail shop in New York. To comply with the law, Wine.com invested in a warehouse in Garden City, along with a retail license, just as it has done in eight other states. For its trouble, Wine.com must offer different Web sites with different inventories and prices to residents of different states.
 ''If people don't play by the rules we think it can backfire on the industry,'' Mr. Bergsund said. ''People may disagree with our tactics but sometimes you have to stir things up to begin change.''
 Even where lawbreaking can be demonstrated, it's not clear what can be done about it. In the Wine.com sting, the gravest consequence was that several retailers were asked to stop their interstate shipments. It's difficult for states to make out-of-state businesses comply with their laws. And when the law seems clear, as does New York's, retailers can still find ways to parse it in their favor.
 K & L Wine Merchants, a major retailer with three locations in California (not the one from which I bought wine), says on its Web site that it will ship to New York. ''What we do, once we ascertain that the customer is 21 years of age and that an adult will be present to sign for delivery, we transfer the title to them here in California, and they ship the wine that they now own to themselves,'' said Keith Wollenberg of K & L. ''We act to facilitate those transactions.''
 Interstate shoppers must check a box on the order form assuming legal responsibility for their order.
 A Supreme Court decision in 2005 made it easier for many consumers to buy directly from wineries, but that decision only made the rules governing retail operations more confusing. 
 The Specialty Wine Retailers Association, a trade group, maintains that the 2005 decision applied to retailers as well as to wineries, and is making that argument as cases come up around the country. A recent court decision in Texas seemed to uphold that position. But in a court case in New York last year, a judge came to the opposite conclusion.
 Standing against efforts to permit interstate purchases are the wholesalers and distributors, who want to strengthen regulations preventing them.
 ''The system didn't used to be anarchic,'' said Craig Wolf, the chairman of the Wine and Spirits Wholesalers of America. ''This result has come about because of attacks on the regulated system over the last 10 or 15 years. But it's been effective for 75 years since the end of Prohibition. We created in this country the most vibrant and competitive market in the world.''
 Mr. Wolf said most Americans were satisfied with the system as it is, ''except for a small, very vocal segment who say they can't get their bottle of 1997 whatever.'' He said wholesalers support the system not because they want to protect profits but because of safety, and he warned that change might make it easier for minors to get alcohol.
 ''The bottom line is you whittle away at the system little by little, and what you end up with is what you have in England, where cheap alcohol has led to binge drinking through the roof,'' he said. ''We don't have tainted and counterfeit products because of wholesalers. This is the gold standard. These things are going to be lost if regulation is ended.''
 Of course, retailers are not calling for the end of regulation. They want regulated interstate shipping, as in Virginia, which now issues licenses to out-of-state retailers, who collect and pay sales tax to Virginia. Washington State is considering a similar bill, which would permit consumers to make legal purchases from an out-of-state retailer. 
 ''It's very difficult if not impossible to enforce compliance off the Internet,'' said Rick Garza, deputy director of the Washington Liquor Control Board. ''We know it happens, so creating a license for it, and permits and requirements is probably the best course, rather than ignoring it.''

HEADLINE: S.& P. Home Price Index Continued to Fall in November

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Home prices in 20 metropolitan areas fell in November for the 11th consecutive month, as foreclosures and a slump in sales added to the glut of unsold properties.
 Prices fell 7.7 percent from a year earlier after dropping 6.1 percent in October, according to the Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller home-price index released Tuesday. The decline is the biggest since the 20-city index was started in 2000. 
 ''The housing market is going to continue to look quite dismal for some time as the imbalances are worked out,'' said Michelle Meyer, an economist at Lehman Brothers in New York.
 Economists expected the home-price index to drop 7.1 percent, according to the median of 14 forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey. Estimates of the decline ranged from 6 percent to 8 percent.
 Compared with a month earlier, home prices fell 2.1 percent. The figures are not seasonally adjusted, so economists prefer to focus on the year-over-year change.
 The index is a composite of transactions in 20 metropolitan areas. Seventeen cities showed a drop in prices from a year earlier, led by a 15 percent decline in Miami. Three cities -- Charlotte, N.C.; Portland, Ore.; and Seattle -- showed increases. In New York, the index fell 4.8 percent.
 Compared with a month earlier, all 20 cities in the survey showed a decline.
 ''We are in an historic housing bust right now,'' Robert J. Shiller, the chief economist at MacroMarkets and a professor at Yale, said in a television interview.
 Mr. Shiller and Karl E. Case, an economics professor at Wellesley, created the home-price index based on research from the 1980s.
 The group's 10-city composite index, which has a longer history, fell a record 8.4 percent in the 12 months that ended in November. The decline is ''probably'' the biggest since ''sometime around World War II,'' Mr. Shiller said.
 Builder Files for Bankruptcy
 Tousa Inc., the Florida-based home builder, said Tuesday that it had filed for bankruptcy protection, hit hard by a downturn in the housing market.
 The company operates in 10 states but has most of its business in Florida.
 Citigroup Global Markets agreed to provide Tousa, formerly called Technical Olympic USA, with up to $150 million in debtor-in-possession financing. 
 In its filing, the company said its total assets were $2.28 billion and total debt was $1.77 billion as of Sept. 30, 2007.

 BODY:
HOW DEEP TO CUT? The Federal Reserve appears poised to announce another rate cut, but policy makers face difficult questions about how far to reduce rates, given that a recession has yet to materialize and that inflation pressures remain a nagging concern. 
 PRESSURE FOR RESIGNATIONS French politicians continued to press for the resignation of top executives at Societe Generale, the bank that has lost $7.3 billion tied to illicit trades by a junior trader. Finance Minister Christine Lagarde, above, said the bank's leaders needed to examine ''whether they should change the captain.'' [C1.] 
 On the day that Societe Generale announced losses tied to a single trader, it also reported one of the largest subprime-related write-downs by a European bank. [C5.] 
 QUESTIONS OF A CONFLICT Many doctors who took part in a recent study of an artificial spinal disk called the Prodisc, a study that hailed the product's results, stood to profit financially if the device succeeded, according to a patient's lawsuit settled last year. [A1.] 
 STIRRING THE CUP The man who built Starbucks, Howard D. Schultz, has retaken the reins in an effort to revive it, and he is scheduled to roll out a plan that will almost certainly involve shutting down more stores in the United States while accelerating expansion overseas. [C1.] 
 F.B.I. AND MORTGAGE INDUSTRY The Federal Bureau of Investigation has opened criminal inquiries into 14 companies as part of a wide-ranging investigation of the troubled mortgage industry, F.B.I. officials said. [C1.] 
 SNIPES TRIAL GOES TO JURY The most prominent tax prosecution in nearly two decades went to the jury after defense lawyers argued that while the actor Wesley Snipes did in fact owe tens of millions of dollars in back taxes, interest and penalties, he had not committed a crime. [C3.] 
 EASIER TO RAISE MONEY Federal regulators are easing rules that have made it difficult for small and medium-size publicly traded companies to raise money. The changes, experts say, are well timed, given the tightening of the credit markets. [C2.] 
 DURABLE GOODS ORDERS JUMP Orders to factories for big-ticket manufactured goods jumped unexpectedly in December, good news amid signs that the economy may be tipping toward a recession. [C4.] 
 wal-mart overhaul In a major reorganization of its sluggish clothing business, Wal-Mart Stores will shut down two divisions at its headquarters in Arkansas, eliminate dozens of positions and move dozens more to New York City. [C2.]

 A CAREER REBOUNDS Stephen Chao, the former News Corporation executive who helped create ''Cops'' for Fox but was fired after nearly drowning Rupert Murdoch's dog, is forming a Web video company that aims to be an educational alternative to YouTube. [C3.]

 A WORLD ON FIFTH AVENUE Foreign retailers are spending lavishly in New York, opening flagship stores in record numbers, real estate experts say. [C6.] 
 AIRLINES REPORT DOWNTURNS Northwest, JetBlue and AirTran Holdings posted fourth-quarter losses as rising fuel costs erased gains from fare increases. But the losses were narrower than expected for Northwest and JetBlue, and shares rose. [C8.] 
 INVESTORS AWAIT THE FED Wall Street advanced sharply as the Federal Reserve opened a two-day meeting at which it is expected to cut interest rates again to revitalize the economy. [C10.] 
 HOUSE PASSES FISCAL PLAN The House approved a $146 billion fiscal stimulus package, hoping to seal a fast-paced deal with President Bush. But Senate Democrats forged ahead with their own, more expensive plan. [A21.] A GROWING INDUSTRY The economy may be slowing down, but Washington's research groups are booming. Organizations like the Council on Foreign Relations and the United States Institute of Peace are constructing multimillion-dollar headquarters. [A12.]

HEADLINE: Campaigning In New York: Tough Room, But Big Prize

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
With Florida behind them and more than 20 primaries looming next Tuesday, the presidential candidates are about to grapple with a state where the Democratic governor's popularity is in the gutter, the most powerful Republican is under federal investigation and the mayor of the largest city bolted not one but both political parties and has been mulling a presidential race himself.
 This is New York, where Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, if he remains in the race after a devastating defeat in Florida, have the home-court advantage. But while each candidate received the blessing of his or her party's establishment, the officeholders, clubhouses and labor unions that make up political organizations today are a shadow of the once-vaunted Tammany machine. 
 New York is also the glass house of presidential politics, where mistakes are magnified by voracious tabloids and all-news television and radio, where every racial, ethnic and religious group prods candidates to cater to its cuisine and foreign policy agenda (the state is home to three times as many American Indians as Mormons) and where voters insist that political supplicants commit themselves on incendiary provincial controversies (congestion pricing, the Giants, Al Sharpton). 
 Newer immigrants have been so successful in embracing the motto of natives -- ''Where's mine?'' -- that alternate-side parking rules are suspended on the Asian lunar New Year, six Muslim holy days and the Hindu festival of lights, in addition to all those Christian, Jewish and national holidays. 
 In New York, politics is not only local, it's personal -- think former Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato's endorsing anybody-but-Giuliani (although he settled on John McCain after initially backing Fred Thompson) and think many Republicans' caring less about who gets elected president than about which nominee would keep them from losing control of their last vestige of power, the State Senate. 
 In this year's abbreviated primary campaign, candidates have less than one week to lose New York, which has the second largest bloc of delegates for the Democrats and third largest for the Republicans. 
 ''You can get a hundred things right,'' said Frank Luntz, a Republican strategist, ''but if you get just one thing wrong, everybody will hear about it.''
 New York presidential primaries were where George McGovern ordered a glass of milk with his kosher hot dog, where Al Gore, without naming names (Willie Horton's, for one), raised questions about a prison furlough program that would haunt Michael S. Dukakis the following fall and where Bill Clinton admitted he smoked pot but, in an early test of his credibility, insisted he had never inhaled. 
 ''What we've seen is what not to do in New York presidential politics,'' William T. Cunningham, a Democratic consultant, said.
 This year, New York is not alien territory to most of the candidates. In addition to Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Giuliani, John Edwards and Mr. McCain have been exposed to New Yorkers in previous campaigns, and every contender has mined the state for contributions. Together, through Sept. 30, they collected more than $49 million from more than 47,000 New Yorkers, second only to Californians.
 This year, too, the rush to judgment compressed the campaign. 
 It has forced New York to compete for the candidates' face time and advertising budgets with all the other states, including New Jersey and Connecticut, that are holding primaries on Feb. 5. With two relatively popular New Yorkers on the ballot, their rivals -- recalling that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg personally spent $160 million on his two mayoral campaigns in the nation's most expensive media market -- have invested their scarce resources elsewhere.
 It is possible that after a year of being stalked by bloggers, talk radio hosts and cable television commentators, the candidates will find the city's dreaded media microscope less daunting. 
 Still, there's that notorious New York attitude. 
 The candidates are not scheduled to debate here before the primary. But just remember four years ago when John Kerry, frustrated by repeated interruptions by reporters, finally exploded: ''Let us finish answering a question.'' 
 New York is also where the party organizations have regularly wielded the election law as a bludgeon against insurgents of every stripe. Until 1980, the Democratic ballot listed only the names of delegates, with no hint of the candidates they were pledged to support. The Republican ballot lifts the curtain on the candidates for the first time this year. 
 Democrats elect most of their 281 delegates (about 14 percent of those needed for the nomination) by Congressional district. Republicans, who generously allowed Mr. Giuliani's rivals on the ballot this year without the challenges that shook John McCain's campaign eight years ago, award most of their 101 delegates (about 8 percent of those required) to the top vote-getter statewide.
 The roster of would-be Republican delegates includes Theodore Roosevelt IV, great-grandson of the former president, for Mr. McCain; Thomas E. Dewey Jr., son of the former governor, for Mitt Romney; and Rudolph V. Giuliani, an 80-year-old retired police officer, who is pledged to support his nephew. 
 Most of the state's Democratic establishment was committed -- before Barack Obama's surge -- to Mrs. Clinton. But the state's ranking Democrat, Gov. Eliot Spitzer, may have already proved himself more of a liability. A poll last month found that only one in every three of his fellow Democrats favored his re-election in 2010. His proposal last summer to grant driver's licenses to illegal immigrants temporarily jolted Mrs. Clinton's campaign.
 Mrs. Clinton began advertising Tuesday on New York radio stations that appeal to black and Hispanic audiences and planned to launch television ads on Wednesday.
 Mr. McCain was planning to campaign in New York on the morning of the primary. Most of the other candidates were still uncertain Tuesday about appearing in New York, a state where, as Jennifer Cunningham, a political consultant, said, there is never a shortage of advice.
 ''Good luck campaigning in a state with 11 million voters and at least 11 million opinions about how to run your race,'' she said.
 Does Mrs. Clinton have any advice for her rivals in New York? ''Do whatever Chuck Schumer does,'' she replied through a spokesman, referring to New York's senior senator, an indefatigable campaigner and fund-raiser. ''It seems to work.''
 New York's voters are moody these days, concerned more about the economy than they were eight, or even four, years ago. 
 ''New York should be the most vulnerable place in the country to terrorism,'' said Kenneth T. Jackson, the Columbia historian, ''but even here, concerns about the stock market, the possible foreclosures of private homes in the outer boroughs and the loss of jobs that pay livable wages with benefits are looming above other concerns.''
 As Kathryn S. Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City, put it, ''We have witnessed the Wall Street swagger turn into a crawl on bended knees.'' 
 Former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo said that however much campaigning has become more homogenized, New York remains unique on at least one count. Notwithstanding Mr. Giuliani's claim to have tamed its unruly residents, Mr. Cuomo said, ''it's the one state where you can't come and get points for saying you hate New York and New Yorkers.''

HEADLINE: Market Rises, Awaiting Another Rate Cut

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Wall Street advanced sharply Tuesday, as the Federal Reserve opened a two-day meeting at which it is expected to cut interest rates again to revitalize the economy.
 The Fed's rate decision is clearly the market's focus this week, but with no announcement expected until Wednesday afternoon, the market digested data on earnings, consumer spending and durable goods.
 The Commerce Department said orders for big-ticket items rose 5.2 percent in December, the widest jump in five months, but the Conference Board, as expected, reported consumer confidence fell in January. 
 ''The market is just in a holding pattern,'' said Todd Leone, managing director of equity trading at Cowen & Company. ''It seems we've hit a short-term bottom, and the market has been stabilizing as we wait to hear what the Fed says.''
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 96.41, or 0.78 percent, to 12,480.30. The blue-chip index closed near its high of the day.
 Broader indexes also rose. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 8.34, or 0.62 percent, to 1,362.30, and the Nasdaq composite advanced 8.15, or 0.35 percent, to 2,358.06.
 The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 2.81, or 0.40 percent, to 705.20.
 Government bond prices fell as stocks rose, indicating that investors feel less need for the safety of Treasuries. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 27/32, to 104 21/32. Its yield, which moves opposite its price, rose to 3.68 percent, from 3.58 percent.
 Oil prices rose 65 cents, to $91.64 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 Wall Street's extreme volatility of recent weeks, amid fears of a recession and further write-downs in the financial sector, gave way to a quieter tone this week.
 But the Fed's rate cuts and auctions of funds to commercial banks have done little to convince investors that Wall Street will return anytime soon to the high levels seen in October. 
 ''It is going to take a little time, and one thing people have to realize is that sometimes consolidation is healthy because the market can't run forever,'' said Ryan Larson, senior equity trader at Voyageur Asset Management. 
 Over the last three months, the Dow has fallen about 12 percent, or more than 1,700 points; the S.& P. has plunged 13 percent, or about 204 points; and the tech-heavy Nasdaq has lost about 507 points, or 18 percent.
 Mr. Larson also said the market was scrutinizing corporate earnings and what chief executives say about 2008. As American Express's fourth-quarter results indicated on Monday, companies are being forced to prepare for slower spending.
 AmEx said its fourth-quarter profit fell 10 percent after it socked away more cash to use in case cardholders cannot pay back their debt. Shares rose 40 cents, to $47.80.
 In other corporate news, the embattled mortgage lender Countrywide Financial, which recently agreed to be bought by Bank of America, posted a sharp loss, as expected, stemming from its missteps in subprime lending. Countrywide rose 36 cents, or 6.1 percent, to $6.31; Bank of America added 74 cents, to $41.94.
 The search engine Yahoo reported fourth-quarter earnings Tuesday that beat expectations, but sales guidance for 2008 disappointed investors. Shares of the company fell $2.15, or 10.3 percent, to $18.66 in after-hours trading after it closed at $20.81 during the regular session.
 Following are the results of Tuesday's Treasury auctions of five-year notes and four-week cash-management bills:

HEADLINE: Research Groups Boom in Washington

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
 -- The economy may be slowing down, but Washington's ideas industry is booming.
 The Center for Strategic and International Studies, a research institution that was effectively broke seven years ago, just bought a $33 million vacant lot downtown as the site for a new home. The Council on Foreign Relations is expanding its Washington office to a $60 million building on F Street. The United States Institute of Peace is erecting a $180 million headquarters of steel and white translucent glass on a corner of the Mall. 
 Not least, the rapidly growing Brookings Institution -- its operating budget is up nearly 50 percent in the past two years alone -- just paid $18.5 million for a satellite building across the street from its headquarters on Massachusetts Avenue, in a stretch near Dupont Circle known as Think Tank Row.
 The result of this boom has been ever more Washington conferences, policy papers and, for better or worse, outside influence on government. Most immediately, the research institutions, which operate as Washington's government-in-waiting, are supplying the presidential campaigns with policy staffs. 
 Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton is drawing expertise from Brookings, the Council on Foreign Relations and from a start-up, the Center for a New American Security. Senator Barack Obama has advisers from Brookings as well as from the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Rudolph W. Giuliani is drawing from the American Enterprise Institute and the Heritage Foundation. Senator John McCain has tapped into both the American Enterprise Institute and the Council on Foreign Relations.
 Mike Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor who came under fire late last month for a number of foreign policy gaffes, has cited John R. Bolton, a former United Nations ambassador in the Bush administration who is now at the American Enterprise Institute, as one of the advisers to his presidential campaign. But Mr. Bolton, who said that he would be happy to speak with Mr. Huckabee, has so far simply exchanged e-mail with him. 
 ''The only advice I have provided is 'call my secretary,' '' Mr. Bolton said in a brief telephone interview.
 The research institutions say the boom is fueled by three major factors: big money from Wall Street, a post-Sept. 11 sense that foreign policy matters and anger at the Bush administration. 
 ''While President Bush was bad for the world, he was good for our business,'' said John Podesta, the chief executive of the Center for American Progress, a liberal research institution financed by, among others, the investor George Soros and his Open Society Institute. Mr. Podesta's annual operating budget is now $23 million after barely four years in business.
 But Mr. Podesta's group is hardly the only one flush with cash. Operating budgets are up at all of Washington's top two dozen research organizations -- liberal, conservative or bipartisan -- and philanthropy is feeding them. As the very richest Americans have given away record amounts of money, the organizations have become prestigious and relatively well-priced recipients of largess. 
 ''To a Wall Streeter, intellectuals are pretty cheap,'' said Walter Russell Mead, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and the author of ''God and Gold: Britain, America and the Making of the Modern World.'' ''There are wedding rings that cost more than I do.'' 
 A $20 million increase in the Brookings operating budget in the past two years, bringing it to $60.7 million in 2007, came largely from donations from a few individuals. Among them were John L. Thornton, the Brookings board chairman and a former president of Goldman Sachs, who in 2006 gave the money for the new John L. Thornton China Center at Brookings. 
 At the same time, some of the country's largest foundations are pouring money into research organizations. In the past five years, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which has assets of $37.6 billion, has committed more than $24 million to the Center for Global Development, a research institution across the street from Brookings on Think Tank Row. The Gates Foundation has also given millions of dollars to Brookings, the Center for Strategic and International Studies, and the Council on Foreign Relations.
 The 10-year-old Gates Foundation initially financed groups that fought AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis in the countries most affected by those diseases but gradually came to realize that it could have a larger impact by influencing policy from the ground up at the research institutions. ''That's when it made sense to us to look at some of these organizations,'' said Joe Cerrell, the foundation's director of global health advocacy.
 The foundation has since committed more than $2 million to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, largely known as a military research organization, for a bipartisan H.I.V.-AIDS study group given the task of developing ideas for how to spend the billions the Bush administration has committed to fighting the disease. 
 Research institution presidents, who spend enormous amounts of time raising money, naturally embrace their big contributors, but they say problems arise when a donor expects a certain result from a study the donor is financing. Research groups say that no matter how tempting the millions, they quickly show such people the door.
 ''I've had conversations with funders and they say, 'We'd kind of like you to do this work, and we'd kind of like you to say this,' '' said John Hamre, the president of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ''I guarantee you a seat at the table but I do not guarantee a result.''
 But experts who study these organizations say big money is increasingly narrowing the focus of research institutions and undermining their quality. ''The agenda is really being distorted by interlopers -- they're the donors,'' said James McGann, a professor of political science at Villanova University, a senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute in Philadelphia and the author of four books on research groups. ''Most people don't want to talk about it because they don't want to bite the hand that feeds them.''
 A larger question is how much impact the organizations really have on government policy, and how much of what they produce is Washington hot air. The record is mixed. 
 The American Enterprise Institute is widely credited with playing a critical role in developing the concept of the surge, the recent increase in troop strength in Iraq. The authors of the institute's report on the surge -- Frederick W. Kagan, a military historian and an A.E.I scholar, and Jack Keane, a retired general -- briefed President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney on the plan shortly before the administration announced it as policy in early 2007.
 The United States Institute of Peace, in collaboration with three other organizations -- the Center for Strategic and International Studies, the Center for the Study of the Presidency, and the James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy at Rice University -- organized meetings and provided staff members and office space for the Iraq Study Group. The co-chairmen of the group were Mr. Baker, a former secretary of state, and Lee H. Hamilton, the director of another research organization, the Woodrow Wilson International Center. 
 The White House has since embraced some recommendations made by the group in a 2006 report that called for a pullback of all American combat brigades in Iraq, diplomatic engagement with Syria and Iran, and a jump-start to Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts. 
 In 2002, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace produced a report calling for ''coercive'' Iraqi weapons inspections, backed up by force and intended to avoid war. The group's thinking made it into a United Nations resolution to disarm the Iraqis, but it died with the American-led invasion.
 ''Institutions like this don't possess power,'' said Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations. ''You're one of many voices in the political marketplace. It's up to those in the marketplace who possess power -- congressmen, people in the executive branch -- to run with one of your ideas.''

HEADLINE: Stimulus Plan Advances

 BODY:
The Senate Finance Committee is set to produce an economic stimulus bill that, on balance, improves on the bill passed by the House on Tuesday. Among other things, the Senate version would extend unemployment benefits as needed for laid-off workers. 
 Extensions are one of the best ways to give an economic shot in the arm. And yet, in his speech on Monday, President Bush warned that changes to the House bill could derail the stimulus effort. Welcome to Washington, where even in the face of impending recession, the needs of ordinary Americans can take a back seat to ideology.
 There are two ways to do fiscal stimulus: direct government spending, like extending unemployment benefits, bolstering food stamps and providing more aid to state governments; and tax cuts, generally rebates to individuals and tax breaks for businesses. Measure for measure, direct spending always gives a faster, bigger result than tax cuts. Among the tax options, rebates targeted to low- and middle-income people are far more effective than business tax breaks. 
 For Mr. Bush and many Republicans, however, tax cuts are always the answer. So the House bill, produced in negotiations between the White House and House leaders, eschews direct government aid. Instead, it provides tax rebates for lower- to upper-middle income Americans while excluding high-income earners, as demanded by Democrats, and tax breaks for business favored by Republicans. That ideological balance is not the best possible deal for everyday Americans. 
 The Senate proposal is not perfect, but it's better. In addition to extending jobless benefits, it would send larger rebates to more lower-income people. The Senate rebate would also go to rich Americans, who don't need it. That would be poor stimulus, but it should make the plan politically palatable to Republicans who reflexively demand tax cuts for the rich. The Senate proposal includes roughly the same business tax breaks as the House bill. 
 The House deserves credit for passing a stimulus bill speedily, and the Senate does, too, for quickly improving on the effort. Senate leaders must now steer the proposal toward a vote, expected as early as Thursday, without letting the bill become bloated. Then, lawmakers can come together to create a worthy final bill for Mr. Bush's signature.

HEADLINE: McCain's Victory in a Party-Only Primary Raises the Hurdles for Romney

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

DATELINE: MIAMI 

 BODY:
Senator John McCain's victory in the Florida primary came in the face of considerable odds and suggests that his chief rival here, Mitt Romney, faces tough going in what has effectively become a two-person Republican field.
 This was a battlefield where Mr. McCain was supposed to be at a disadvantage, the first competitive contest open only to Republicans. (The others allowed independents to vote.) ''An all-Republican primary!'' Mr. McCain said in his victory speech here. 
 Even though voters here overwhelmingly said their top concern was the weakening economy -- the issue that Mr. Romney sought to turn to his advantage, asserting that he was far more qualified than Mr. McCain to manage the country back to prosperity -- exit polls found that Republicans were more likely to chose Mr. McCain as the best candidate to deal with economic problems.
 The weak performance of Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, means that Mr. McCain will now face diminished competition for moderate Republican voters. To compound Mr. Romney's challenge, Republicans said that Mr. Giuliani was on the verge of throwing his support to Mr. McCain, an endorsement that could help Mr. McCain achieve what will be his main goal in the days ahead: getting the party to rally behind him. 
 What is more, Mike Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor who came in fourth Tuesday night, declared that he was staying in the race, suggesting that he would continue to compete with Mr. Romney for conservative Christian voters.
 For much of the year, the party's conservative base has exhibited deep unease about the ideological credentials of Mr. McCain, given his championing in the Senate of campaign finance regulation, his advocacy of granting illegal immigrants a path to citizenship and his support for steps to address global warming. A critical question now is whether social and economic conservatives and the Republican Party establishment will put aside their qualms and back Mr. McCain or come together to try to stop him. 
 His opponents include a powerful cross-section of conservative leaders, including Grover G. Norquist, the anti-tax advocate, and the talk-show host Rush Limbaugh. But he has gradually won increased support from prominent elected Republicans; in Florida, he won the endorsements of Gov. Charlie Crist and Senator Mel Martinez, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee. And Mr. Romney's evolution over the years on issues like abortion, gay rights and immigration has given Mr. McCain, of Arizona, an opportunity to paint him as an opportunist, a label that could limit Mr. Romney's ability to energize conservatives on his behalf.
 Yet if neither Mr. McCain nor Mr. Romney is the perfect candidate in the eyes of many Republicans, the results in Florida leave the party little option but to choose between them. The campaigns of the two leading alternatives, Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Huckabee, both faded away here. Whether they linger in the race or not, they will be standing at the sidelines, described by McCain and Romney aides as little more than bit players.
 ''There's no question about it: It's now a Romney-McCain race,'' said Jim Greer, the Florida Republican chairman.
 Mr. Romney's aides made clear that he had no intention of giving up. He certainly has the resources to compete, and he signaled that he would use them in the coming week as the campaign expands to a national scale and puts a premium on the ability to buy television advertising time and pay for get-out-the-vote operations from coast to coast. 
 In his concession speech, Mr. Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, thanked his supporters, saying they had all become family. ''Don't expect to be part of the inheritance,'' he said, drawing laughter. ''I'm not sure there's going to be much left after this.''
 Mr. Romney did better among conservative voters here than Mr. McCain did, a reminder of Mr. McCain's fundamental weakness. Mr. McCain used his speech Tuesday night to try to close that gap, emphasizing his allegiance to the principles of former President Ronald Reagan. 
 The differences between these two presidential contenders -- their backgrounds, their campaign styles and their resources -- could hardly be more stark.
 Mr. McCain is the candidate of national security, building on his military background, his support for the war in Iraq and the success President Bush had running for re-election on the same theme in 2004. Mr. Romney is trying to keep the focus closer to home, saying that the economy is the issue of greatest concern to voters and that dealing with that problem is ''in his DNA.'' 
 ''A McCain candidacy is very different than a Romney candidacy,'' said Fergus Cullen, the Republican chairman in New Hampshire. ''You start with McCain's credibility on military matters. It is unimpeachable, and gives him the moral authority and experience that Romney doesn't have. Romney's private sector success is something that no one else in the field has.''
 Mr. McCain is the familiar, white-haired picture of Washington and the Senate. Mr. Romney is the intense-talking executive turned governor who is running against Washington. Mr. McCain presents himself as a man of principle -- ''Let me give you some straight talk,'' he often says -- who is willing to suffer the political consequences for breaking with party orthodoxy. 
 Mr. Romney is in line with all the proper positions for a Republican conservative, but he underwent a series of transformations to get there, leaving him vulnerable to the charges of inconsistency Mr. McCain has hurled. 
 Mr. Romney's aides said they thought Mr. McCain had been heading for defeat until he rolled out those two last-minute endorsements, from Mr. Crist and Mr. Martinez, an enormously popular Cuban-American who campaigned with Mr. McCain in Latino parts of the state. 
 But in this first test before an audience of Republican voters -- the very audience Mr. Romney said he had been waiting for -- it was Mr. McCain, long the errant child of the Republican Party, who won. What is more, he alone among the presidential candidates in both parties can claim three victories. 
 It is a good position to be in as he sails toward next Tuesday, when more than 20 states hold nominating contests.

HEADLINE: Disillusioned With Republicans, and Disappointed in the Alternatives

BYLINE: By ADAM NOSSITER; Brenda Goodman contributed reporting from High Falls, Ga.

DATELINE: COLUMBIA, Tenn. 

 BODY:
The domed courthouse clock tower tolls the hour, but not much else breaks the stillness in this centuries-old county seat where politics seems to have reached equilibrium, balanced between ancient Democratic traditions and newer Republican ones.
 Beneath the surface peace, though, in the storefronts, diners and offices around the square, there is unease as Tuesday's primaries approach. A prosperity that has endowed this city of 34,000 with fancy antiques stores and well-appointed personal investment offices is weakening. Unemployment in Maury County is rising as a nearby auto plant declines, unfamiliar candidates are on the ballot and all the history accumulated here over two centuries, in the middle of a politically middling state, is proving to be an unreliable guide. 
 In November, Democrats need to win here in this swing county in the hilly Nashville exurbia, just as they need to win in the rest of Tennessee and in its neighbor Arkansas, Southern states that have voted for the winner in the last eight presidential elections. But the choices available in the coming Democratic primary have led to disquiet among independent voters, Democratic-leaning Republicans and even some traditional Democrats, according to interviews here and across the state line in Arkansas. 
 These states are among four in the South voting in primary elections on Tuesday (the others are Alabama and Georgia) in a region that went solidly for President Bush in the last two elections but where Democrats hope to make inroads this November, capitalizing on dissatisfaction with the Republicans. That hope may be unrealistic, even in the crucial swing states. 
 ''I wish there was somebody worth voting for,'' said Buford Moss, a retired Union Carbide worker sitting at the back table of Bucky's Family Restaurant here, with a group of regulars, in a county seat that -- as the home of the 11th president, James K. Polk -- is one of the ancestral homelands of Jacksonian Democracy. 
 ''The Democrats have left the working people,'' Mr. Moss said.
 ''We have nobody representing us,'' he continued, adding that he was ''sad to say'' he had voted previously for Mr. Bush. He was considering sitting out this election altogether. ''Anyone but Obama-Osama,'' he said, chuckling at a designation that met with mirthful approval at the table. 
 In interviews around the courthouse square, voters stuttered over Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama in matchups with Republicans, particularly Senator John McCain, whose military credentials give him solid regional armoring. Some white voters voiced outright alarm over Mr. Obama, and though he is a Christian, allusions to his supposed Muslim ties were frequent, as were suggestions that he remained a disturbingly unknown quantity.
 White men, in particular, expressed general fearfulness -- over a possible terrorist attack, over an unnamed threat from Muslims, over Hispanic immigrants and over the weakening economy. These fears led them to reflect positively on Republican candidates, perceived as more hard-line on most fronts. 
 ''I think our greatest fear is our terrorist enemies,'' said Waymon L. Hickman, senior chairman of First Farmers & Merchants bank, whose headquarters building dominates Main Street here.
 ''You get Peloski up there and they say we've lost the war, and that just fuels our adversaries,'' said Mr. Hickman, incorrectly pronouncing the name of Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
 He described himself as an ''independent'' voter but said he could not envision voting Democratic unless it was for a centrist like Gov. Phil Bredesen of Tennessee. As for Mr. Obama, ''he's got to say the things he's saying, to win the primary,'' Mr. Hickman said, expressing disdain. 
 Mr. Obama may fare well in primaries in Alabama and Georgia, where blacks make up roughly a quarter of the overall voting population and perhaps twice that percentage in the Democratic primary electorate, but even if he does, it is unclear how meaningful primary victories in these states would be in November. 
 The voters in Tennessee and Arkansas are already looking past next month's low-profile primary contests and ahead to the general-election matchup, which many said they were anticipating with keen interest because of the pressing issues of the declining economy and the war and, in some cases, anger at Mr. Bush. 
 The candidates and their campaigns, devoted to larger delegate prizes elsewhere, were nearly invisible in the region until after the South Carolina Democratic primary last Saturday. Even in Arkansas, where Mrs. Clinton lived for nearly two decades, her headquarters is an inconspicuous storefront at the edge of downtown Little Rock, though she is expected to visit the state this week. Still, with a nod to the importance of these states that remain so difficult yet so vital for Democrats, Mrs. Clinton campaigned in Tennessee on Sunday, immediately after the South Carolina primary, and Mr. Obama flew to Birmingham, Ala. 
 Beyond Super Tuesday, there may be trouble for the Democrats. Swing voters perceive both front-runners as too liberal, though Mrs. Clinton has support in Arkansas because her husband remains popular. But here in Maury County, which has voted Democratic and Republican in the last three decades, none expressed enthusiasm for Mrs. Clinton. 
 Similar unease was voiced in Yell County, Ark., another place that has swung back and forth, where some were quick to say that Mr. Obama's race was not prohibitive for them personally but could well be for others.
 Only John Edwards, a fellow Southerner but now considered an also-ran, met with broad approval from independents who were interviewed in the Tennessee county; in Arkansas, Mrs. Clinton's most ardent supporters in the undulating ''Free State of Yell'' -- so called because of a history of electoral eccentricity -- conceded that they knew plenty who were just as sharply opposed to her candidacy. 
 Former Bush voters disillusioned with the president said flatly they would not vote for Mr. Obama, while others expressed disappointment with the available choices. Meanwhile, Republicans, even those critical of Mr. Bush, said that the too-liberal Democratic choices left them more solidly than ever with their party, though none voiced great enthusiasm for the field.
 ''Ain't none of the Republicans got me jumping up and down,'' said Ken Sumner, 58, who manages Ken's River View Cafe in High Falls, Ga. ''McCain, I think he's a good man. I think he means good. I really don't know if he has the energy to be president.''
 Political professionals in the border states of the South are skeptical about Democratic prospects this year, without being completely dismissive. 
 ''Does a Democratic candidate have any kind of shot?'' asked Bruce Oppenheimer, a political scientist at Vanderbilt University in Nashville. 
 Tennessee ''potentially could be in play,'' Mr. Oppenheimer said, ''but a lot of other states might come before it.'' 
 Arkansas ''will stay on the charts longer for her,'' said Jay Barth of Hendrix College in Conway, referring to Mrs. Clinton, but he added that ''the odds are not with'' her in a matchup with Mr. McCain. 
 In Yell County, in the foothills of the Ouachita Mountains, a place so ornery that tombstones and bird dogs were once said to have taken part in elections, a number of residents said local voters would probably support Mrs. Clinton -- former President Bill Clinton is said to have relatives in the county -- unless she were matched against Mr. McCain. Mention of Mr. Obama merely provoked discomfort. 
 ''Statements I've heard, Obama, they're seriously afraid of him,'' said Bobby Rollans, a retired teacher, sitting at Savanna's, a restaurant perched on the Arkansas River. Bill Mashek, a retired National Guard officer, said, ''I've talked to some yellow-dog Democrats; they won't vote for Obama.'' 
 Ominously for Democrats, perhaps, even longtime Republican voters dissatisfied with their party are nonetheless still stuck on the fence. 
 ''This is the first election that I am more seriously wearing that independent sign,'' said Charlotte Battles, the director emeritus of a boarding school in Columbia for children with developmental disabilities.
 ''This year, I think there is a feeling of a need for change,'' Ms. Battles said, ''whether that's a Democrat, or a Republican.''

HEADLINE: Outside Groups Aid Obama, Vocal Critic of Their Influence

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE

 BODY:
After months of denouncing the influence of special-interest money in politics, Senator Barack Obama is nonetheless entering a critical phase of the presidential campaign benefiting from millions of dollars being spent outside campaign finance rules.
 Mr. Obama has repudiated a California group, Vote Hope, that is working on his behalf. But it has pressed on and, along with a sister organization called PowerPac.org, is planning to spend up to $4 million promoting him in California and conducting voter registration drives aimed at blacks in 11 Southern states. 
 The group has already run radio advertisements with local ministers in South Carolina. New advertisements, some for television, have been prepared for California, one with the rap star Common and others focusing on black and Latino voters. 
 As the campaign treasuries of Mr. Obama and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton are rapidly draining heading into the nominating contests in more than 20 states on Tuesday, independent political groups -- whether so-called 527 groups, political action committees, nonprofit organizations or trade unions -- are stepping in to help fill the void. The efforts of these groups, particularly 527s, which are named for a section of the tax code under which they fall, worry campaign finance watchdogs because many can take unlimited contributions from donors and have limited oversight. 
 Mr. Obama's campaign says it has taken pains to discourage these efforts on its behalf, and in fact the campaign has no recourse in controlling them. ''We do not think people should be donating to 527s,'' said Bill Burton, a campaign spokesman. ''We would rather have them involved in our campaign. It is our hope that anyone who supports Obama does so directly through his campaign and not through these outside groups.''
 The Clinton campaign, which has not made an issue of outside help, has been a much greater beneficiary of these groups. Mrs. Clinton has large unions representing government employees and teachers on her side, as well as the politically savvy feminist organization Emily's List. The two unions plan to spend millions of dollars on her behalf through direct mail, phone banks and get-out-the-vote efforts in Super Tuesday states.
 The teachers' union, which has 1.4 million members, has budgeted $3 million for the effort, while the government employees' union has earmarked $5 million. Meanwhile, Emily's List has an effort directed at women just outside the New York City media market.
 Mr. Obama has lined up support from unions representing plumbers and pipefitters, as well as hospitality and garment workers. One union, Unite Here, plans to mobilize its 450,000 members through direct mail advertisements, phone banks and door-to-door visits in Super Tuesday states. It will also continue efforts, begun in Nevada, to run pro-Obama television and radio spots, many in Spanish and aimed at voters in California. The plumbers' and pipefitters' union, which has 340,000 members, said it was working with the Obama campaign to get out its membership and was encouraging members to donate time as Obama campaign volunteers. 
 Unlike 527s, unions can coordinate some activities with campaigns, and spending by their political action committees must be reported to federal regulators.
 The efforts by Vote Hope pose a particular challenge to Mr. Obama's campaign, given his repeated criticism of Mrs. Clinton and former Senator John Edwards for having accepted similar help. 
 Referring to Mr. Edwards, Mr. Obama said in December in the heat of the Iowa campaign, ''John said yesterday he didn't believe in these 527s.'' Then he added, ''You can't say yesterday you don't believe in it, and today three-quarters of a million dollars is being spent for you.''
 The two California groups supporting Mr. Obama, Vote Hope, which is a 527, and PowerPac.org, which is a nonprofit group, are both creations of Steve Phillips, a longtime social activist and lawyer who founded PowerPac.org five years ago.
 ''We have a chance to make an impact,'' Mr. Phillips said. ''There are not the resources within the Obama campaign to organize. You need a dedicated organization with a dedicated revenue stream.''
 Mr. Phillips donated $95,000 to the effort. He is also the son-in-law of Herbert Sandler, a billionaire banker and major donor to the Democratic Party and liberal causes. Vote Hope plans to spend about $1 million supporting Mr. Obama in California, while PowerPac.org has budgeted $2 million to $3 million for the nonpartisan voter registration drive in the South, help that could not come at a better time.
 ''These groups are critical to the campaigns,'' said Kenneth Gross, a campaign finance lawyer who advises Democratic candidates. ''The campaigns are spread so thin on Feb. 5, in terms of geography and television coverage. There is never enough money to do what you want. So these groups can step in and play a critical role.''
 So long as unions are politicking among their own members, they can coordinate their efforts with individual candidates and campaigns. While rules may vary according to the structure of the group, many outside organizations, like nonprofit groups and 527s, cannot coordinate their activities with a campaign. Some of these groups can receive donations in unlimited amounts, or in amounts that exceed campaign finance limits, and with looser disclosure rules.
 According to Vote Hope's Web site, its goal is ''to get hundreds of thousands of new votes pledged for Obama -- starting Jan. 9 and leading up to the state's Feb. 5, 2008 primary.'' 
 To that end, Vote Hope and PowerPac have set up what amounts to a parallel campaign to the Obama organization, specifically directed at blacks, Latinos and young people. 
 A Vote Hope advertisement featuring the rapper Common saying ''Obama is down for us'' has already run on television in San Francisco and can be found on the group's Web site and on YouTube. Vote Hope's Web site is also maintaining its own voter data bank of Obama supporters.
 In addition, the Web publication Politico.com posted a memorandum sent to Vote Hope supporters outlining a PowerPac.org drive to hire people -- at $12.50 an hour -- to find voters for Mr. Obama, drive them to the polls and then check with polling locations to be certain they have voted. 
 The Obama campaign says it would rather the money come directly to the campaign itself. 
 ''There is much that you and others associated with Vote Hope can accomplish for the Obama candidacy within his official organization,'' the Obama campaign said in a Dec. 28 letter to Mr. Phillips. ''An independent effort outside that organization undermines the senator's message.'' 
 Among unions, Tom Snyder, the political director of Unite Here, which represents a number of groups including hospitality and garment workers, said the group would be sending a big ''positive pro-Obama'' message in Super Tuesday states, just as it did in Nevada and South Carolina. The group's political action committee has about $660,000 on hand for its efforts. 
 ''We plan to communicate with our members and turn them out,'' Mr. Snyder said. 
 On behalf of Mrs. Clinton, Edward J. McElroy, president of the American Federation of Teachers, predicts a ''tsunami'' of activity as Tuesday draws closer. This will include phone banks, door-to-door visits and fliers on issues like education and the economy, distributed to a membership that is about 70 percent women and has an 80 percent voter registration rate. 
 Equally active on behalf of Mrs. Clinton is the American Federation of State, Local and Municipal Employees, which will be sending staff members to important Super Tuesday states to drum up support among its members. For the entire election cycle, including races for president, Congress and governor, the union has budgeted $60 million. 
 ''We will have waves of mailings leading up to Feb. 5,'' said Larry Scanlon, political director for the union. Mr. Scanlon estimates that ''several million'' fliers will be mailed, to be followed up by both live and recorded telephone calls.

HEADLINE: RESURGENT McCAIN IS FLORIDA VICTOR; GIULIANI FAR BACK

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER and MEGAN THEE; John M. Broder contributed reporting from Miami; Michael Powell from Orlando, Fla.; and Michael Luo from St. Petersburg, Fla.

DATELINE: MIAMI 

 BODY:
Senator John McCain defeated Mitt Romney on Tuesday to win the delegate-rich Florida primary, solidifying his transformation to the Republican front-runner and dealing a devastating blow to the presidential hopes of Rudolph W. Giuliani.
 Republican officials said after Mr. Giuliani's distant third-place finish that he was likely to endorse Mr. McCain, possibly as early as Wednesday in California. They said the two candidates' staffs were discussing the logistics of an endorsement.
 The results were a decisive turning point in the Republican race, effectively winnowing the field to Mr. McCain and Mr. Romney, two candidates with very different backgrounds who have little affection for one another but share a similar challenge in winning over elements of the party suspicious of their ideological credentials. 
 While most of the attention in Florida was on the Republicans, Democratic voters gave Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton a victory in a virtually uncontested race. The Democratic Party had stripped the state of its delegates as a punishment for moving its primary earlier in the year, and the leading candidates refrained from campaigning there. 
 Mr. McCain's victory showed he could win among Republican voters. Florida allows only registered Republicans to vote in its primary, unlike New Hampshire and South Carolina, where Mr. McCain's victories earlier this month were fueled by independent voters. 
 With 99 percent of the precincts reporting, Mr. McCain had 36 percent of the vote, Mr. Romney 31 percent, Mr. Giuliani 15 percent and Mike Huckabee 14 percent.
 ''Our victory might not have reached landslide proportions,'' Mr. McCain said, ''but it is sweet nonetheless.'' 
 After a campaign in which he was often on the attack, Mr. McCain went on to praise his rivals, especially Mr. Giuliani, who he said had ''invested his heart and soul in this primary, and who conducted himself with all the qualities of the exceptional American leader he truly is.''
 Mr. Romney made clear that he would go all-out in the coming week, as the presidential race builds toward its biggest day so far, a set of more than 20 contests across the country on Tuesday. He and Mr. McCain fought an increasingly bitter battle in Florida, and they now seem likely to take their messages to the national stage, with Mr. Romney trying to portray Mr. McCain as out of step with his party on critical issues and ill-equipped to deal with the economic downturn and with Mr. McCain suggesting that Mr. Romney's principles yield too easily to the political winds and that he cannot be trusted on national security. 
 The meaning of Mr. McCain's victory starts with the trove of 57 delegates it brings him, the bounty of a winner-take-all contest and the biggest prize of the campaign to date. But it also gives him a chance to start persuading his party to put aside the deep internal divisions that have been exposed by the campaign and begin coalescing around him.
 Mr. Romney was having none of it. He continued to call for change in Washington and got in what sounded like another swipe at Mr. McCain when he said America needed a president who had ''actually had a job in the real economy.''
 Surveys of voters leaving polling places painted a picture of how successful each campaign was. They found that Mr. McCain not only did significantly better than Mr. Romney among voters who listed the war as their top concern, but also did better than him with voters who said they were most concerned about the economy.
 Mr. Romney did significantly better than Mr. McCain among voters who said they were most concerned about immigration.
 Both candidates now face the challenge of rallying the fractured party establishment and grass-roots conservatives behind them -- or at least not around their opponent. 
 Mr. McCain, of Arizona, emerges from Florida with an opportunity to get back to where he was at the beginning of this roller-coaster of an election season: the anointed front-runner. Mr. Romney, the former Massachusetts governor whose early goals of winning Iowa and New Hampshire were thwarted, wanted to show he could prevail in a competitive election somewhere outside his native Michigan so he could battle on in the week to come.
 But the outcome could be decisive for Mr. Giuliani, who suffered lopsided losses in all the early voting states this year and had staked his candidacy on a strong showing in Florida, where he campaigned more than anywhere else and outspent his rivals on television advertisements over the last month. 
 Exit polls showed that Mr. Giuliani did not even have a clear edge among voters who were most concerned about his signature issue, terrorism; incomplete returns Tuesday night showed him narrowly finishing ahead of Mr. Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor, who barely campaigned in Florida.
 Mr. Giuliani, speaking in Orlando, thanked his supporters and talked about his campaign in the past tense but did not drop out of the race. ''The responsibility of leadership doesn't end with a single campaign,'' he said in a serious, gracious speech that he leavened with a humorous asides. ''If you believe in a cause, it goes on and you continue to fight for it, and we will. I'm proud that we chose to stay positive and to run a campaign of ideas.''
 Surveys of voters leaving the polls found that nearly half of Republican voters listed the economy as the most important issue in exit polls, while 21 percent said terrorism, 16 percent immigration and 14 percent the war in Iraq. 
 Four in 10 Republican voters said illegal immigrants working in the United States should be deported, while about 3 in 10 said they should be allowed to stay as temporary workers, and the same number said they should be offered a chance to apply for citizenship. Mr. McCain was supported by a plurality of those who favored citizenship, and Mr. Romney by those who favored deportation. 
 Hispanics, who made up more than one-tenth of the Republican voters, said they were more inclined to favor a guest-worker program over deportation. Forty-three percent of them said illegal immigrants should be allowed to remain in the United States as temporary workers, while one-third said they should be offered the opportunity to apply for citizenship. Only one-fifth of Hispanic Republicans said they favored deporting illegal immigrants.
 Mr. McCain, who last spring supported the immigration proposal that would have created a guest-worker program and a path toward citizenship for illegal immigrants, won roughly half the Hispanic vote. Mr. Giuliani, who strongly courted Cuban-Americans in the Miami area, won about one-quarter of the Hispanic vote, and Mr. Romney, who took the hardest line on illegal immigration, finished a distant third.
 Mr. McCain may have been helped with some Hispanic voters by the endorsement he gained last week from Senator Mel Martinez, Republican of Florida. An even bigger surprise endorsement, by the popular Republican governor, Charlie Crist, also appeared to help him. 
 More than 4 in 10 voters said Mr. Crist's endorsement of Mr. McCain was important to them, and just over half of them voted for Mr. McCain. 
 The exit poll was conducted throughout the state by Edison Media Research and Mitofsky International for the National Election Pool with 1,505 Republican primary voters. To take into account the large number of early and absentee voters in Florida, Edison/Mitofsky conducted a pre-election telephone poll and included those results with the opinions of the voters exiting polls on Tuesday. 
 Mr. McCain, who ran a more negative campaign than usual against Mr. Romney in the last few days, praised Mr. Romney and his supporters in his victory speech, saying, ''The margin that separated us tonight surely isn't big enough for me to brag about or for you to despair.''

HEADLINE: Bernanke's Midterm Tests

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: leonhardt@nytimes.com

 BODY:
The chairman of the Federal Reserve has come to seem a bit like a Supreme Court justice -- an unelected, unaccountable figure who wields power for years, regardless of who's in the White House.
 Since World War II, three men -- Alan Greenspan, Paul Volcker and William McChesney Martin -- have dominated the Fed, running it for a combined 45 years. All of them were named to the job by a president from one political party only to be reappointed by a president from the other. It's become custom to treat the Fed chairman as a nonpartisan economic sage, rather than as a political appointee.
 But it is nothing more than custom. By law, a chairman's term lasts only four years. And this Friday, Ben Bernanke will reach the halfway point of his first term. Sometime before Feb. 1, 2010, the next president will have to decide whether Mr. Bernanke should get a second term. 
 His timing certainly hasn't been the luckiest. He took over just as the real estate market was peaking, and the resulting bust has left the economy on the brink of recession. Assuming that the Fed cuts its benchmark interest rate another half of a percentage point on Wednesday, as the markets expect, it will have reduced the rate 1.25 points in a week and a half. During Mr. Greenspan's 18-year term, through two bear markets, the 9/11 attacks and various other financial crises, he never had to reduce rates so sharply. 
 Mr. Bernanke continues to command deep respect from many economists, who praise his creative responses to the mortgage crisis and his attempts to lift the Fed's veil of mystery. But Wall Street and, to some extent, Washington have been less impressed.
 His efforts at openness have sometimes sowed confusion about what the Fed was really doing, and he and his colleagues have appeared slow to grasp the depth of the economy's problems.
 ''It's been a difficult and unusual period, and they've struggled a bit,'' as John Makin of the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative group, said. ''They haven't been very steady.''
 So it seems fair to ask two questions at the midway point of Mr. Bernanke's term. What are his odds of being reappointed? And based on what he's done so far, is he likely to deserve another term?
 The answers to the two questions, unfortunately, have less to do with each other than you may imagine. The Fed may have the reputation of an all-powerful institution, but it mainly regulates banks and sets short-term interest rates. It doesn't run the economy.
 If the real estate slump does lead to a nasty recession -- or even just 18 months of slow growth and rising unemployment -- it may not matter what Mr. Bernanke does. By reappointing him, a new administration would be tying itself to the Bush administration and the housing bust.
 Last week, while interviewing John McCain, I was surprised that he was already trying to put a little distance between himself and the Fed. We had been talking about Mr. Greenspan -- whom Mr. McCain loves to praise -- when I asked how he thought Mr. Bernanke was doing. I figured he would duck the question, because presidents (and presidential candidates) have made a practice of not talking about the Fed. They generally want to show that they understand that it's an independent body.
 But Mr. McCain said he wasn't sure whether Mr. Bernanke had taken the right steps or done so quickly enough. I then re-asked the question, to make sure he said what he'd wanted to. He paused and said, ''It's not clear yet.''
 And Mr. McCain, like Mr. Bernanke, is a Republican. A Democratic president would have additional reasons to choose a new chairman. The job brings unmatched economic prestige. In a way no one else could, a Fed chairman could make headlines -- and still manage to appear apolitical -- by, say, reminding Congress about the relationship between tax cuts and deficits. 
 By 2010, almost a quarter-century will have passed since someone originally chosen by the Democrats -- Mr. Volcker -- was running the Fed.
 In his recent memoir, Mr. Greenspan said he had assumed Bill Clinton wouldn't reappoint him in 1996. ''No doubt,'' Mr. Greenspan wrote, ''he would want one of his own.'' In the end, Mr. Clinton did reappoint Mr. Greenspan, thanks largely to his inflation-fighting credibility on Wall Street.
 But I'm not sure the next Democratic president will make the same call in 2010. If a Democrat wins in November, I would give Mr. Bernanke slightly worse than 50-50 odds of being renamed. If a Republican wins, he probably still has better than an even chance. 
 The question of whether he deserves another term is another matter. To listen to the noise from Wall Street lately, you might assume that Mr. Bernanke had somehow caused the economy's problems by not cutting rates more aggressively. 
 That's ludicrous. Sure, he has made some mistakes. At the close of two separate meetings last year -- in August and December -- the Fed released a statement that seemed to signal calm about the economy, only to reverse course in the days that followed. In general, Mr. Bernanke's forecasts have been too sunny over the last six months.
 On the other hand, his forecast was a lot better than Wall Street's in mid-2006. Back then, he resisted calls for further interest rate increases because he thought the economy might be weakening. He was dead-on right about that -- and the situation would be even worse now if he had listened to his critics then.
 More important than any one forecast, Mr. Bernanke has proved to be a skillful chairman in several ways. He has been open to divergent views within the Fed and has made creative stabs at unfreezing the financial system, like the recent auctions to lend money to banks. 
 The fairest, most serious criticism of him doesn't have anything to do with the last six months. It has to do with his role in letting the housing bubble get as big as it did. 
 As a Fed governor serving under Mr. Greenspan from 2002 to 2005, Mr. Bernanke did little to halt the explosion of wishful-thinking mortgages. When he became chairman in early 2006 -- with billions of dollars of bad loans still to be made -- he continued to do little. He and Mr. Greenspan (who deserves most of the blame) figured that if the banks were making the loans, the loans must have been fine. It was the circular logic that comes with a near-religious belief in free markets.
 During Mr. Bernanke's academic career at Princeton, he specialized in studying the mistakes that the Fed made during the Great Depression and that Japan's central bank made in the 1990s. The recent sins of the Fed have been far less serious, but they have still been big enough to have had consequences. 
 Mr. Bernanke won't get a chance at a do-over, because there won't be another housing bubble anytime soon. He will, however, have ample chances to show that he understands the big lesson of this crisis -- that a well-functioning American economy depends on a more vigilant Fed. 
 He has a ways to go. But he still has some time.

HEADLINE: For a Change, New Jersey's Primary Is at the Storm's Center

BYLINE: By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI and DAVID W. CHEN

DATELINE: BLACKWOOD, N.J. 

 BODY:
From the spectacle of a visit by a former president to the buzz of informal gatherings in living rooms and coffee shops across New Jersey, Democrats find themselves in a competitive Democratic presidential primary for the first time in a generation.
 For years, New Jersey served as a political A.T.M., as presidential candidates would visit wealthy contributors to raise money but rarely campaign because of the late primary. But last year, New Jersey officials moved the primary up to put the state where it finds itself today, at a pivotal point in the nomination fight between Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York and Barack Obama of Illinois. 
 So on Tuesday morning at Camden Community College here, hundreds of people waited in line outside the school gymnasium as security guards screened the crowd of close to 1,000 and helicopters whirred overhead, awaiting the chance to see Bill Clinton make his first campaign appearance since his combative approach dominated much of the campaigning in South Carolina and Nevada.
 ''We can turn America around,'' Mr. Clinton said, promising that his wife could restore the peace and prosperity that marked much of his two terms as president. ''We've done it before. She will lead us in doing it again.'' 
 Three hours later, with Mr. Clinton off to his next stop in Ohio, two of Mr. Obama's most visible supporters in New Jersey, Mayor Cory A. Booker of Newark and State Senator John H. Adler of Cherry Hill, countered with a pointed critique of Mr. Clinton's message.
 Yet as supporters of the two leading candidates gathered their forces, pollsters and many party leaders questioned how competitive the race here would be.
 ''This is a whole new territory,'' said Joseph Marbach, a political science professor at Seton Hall University. ''Even the political establishment is a little bit unsure of what the turnout could be.''
 Senator Clinton has a double-digit lead in most polls, along with the support of Gov. Jon S. Corzine, most of the state Democratic establishment and the county bosses who control New Jersey's political apparatuses. For his part, Mr. Obama has drawn large and enthusiastic crowds during his visits, most recently in Jersey City last month on the day after he finished second to Senator Clinton in the New Hampshire primary and ahead of former Senator John Edwards of North Carolina. 
 But since more than 20 other states are voting next Tuesday, Mr. Obama has been reluctant to invest the time and money necessary to overcome Mrs. Clinton's present advantages.
 Moreover, the polls have proved unreliable this primary season. In the Democratic contests alone, they underestimated the breadth of Mr. Obama's victory in the Iowa caucuses, erred badly in Mrs. Clinton's surprise victory in New Hampshire and again miscalculated how much Mr. Obama would win by in South Carolina. 
 In New Jersey, a Quinnipiac poll released last week showed Mrs. Clinton leading Mr. Obama by 17 percentage points. His supporters maintain that he has gained ground since his landslide victory in South Carolina, the endorsement by members of the Kennedy family, and the remarks of Mr. Clinton, who tried to minimize the importance of Mr. Obama's victory by likening it to that of Jesse Jackson, who won the primaries there in 1984 and 1988 but not the nominations. 
 In addition, because of the surge in new registrations -- 48,000 since November -- and rules that allow unaffiliated voters to vote for either Republican or Democratic candidates, political observers say the potential for a large turnout makes the race difficult to predict.
 The new timing of the primary also gives voters a voice in the Republican race. Although former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York City led most polls throughout last year, his support has eroded since December -- as it has in New York -- and most recent surveys have shown him trailing Senator John McCain, with Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, vying for third place. 
 Neither the Clinton nor Obama campaign would say what turnout it expected Tuesday. An even bigger unknown is the demographic breakdown of voters who will come to the polls, factors that could be crucial in a race between female and African-American candidates. 
 But because this is the first competitive Democratic primary in New Jersey since Walter F. Mondale defeated Gary Hart in 1984, party officials say the turnout is likely to far exceed last year's total, when only 10 percent of registered voters cast ballots, and could approach 35 percent.
 ''There's a Democratic tide that's easy to feel but hard to quantify,'' said Richard McGrath, a spokesman for the state Democratic Party.
 Back in December, Mrs. Clinton held huge leads over Mr. Obama and Mr. Edwards. But Mr. Edwards has failed to win any primary so far, and his most prominent supporter in New Jersey, Senate President Richard J. Codey, was said to be considering whether to withdrew his backing and endorse either Mr. Obama or Mrs. Clinton.
 As for the race between the two who lead the polls, Mr. Obama has cut in half the 35-point lead Mrs. Clinton held in December, according to recent polls. And although even some of his supporters concede that it would be enormously difficult to overcome that kind of lead, they are still urging him to campaign in the state. Even if he loses the raw vote, New Jersey's delegates will be divided in proportion to the number of votes each candidate receives, and even a close second-place finish would be valuable. 
 In the complex math governing the Democratic primary in New Jersey, the party will elect 70 delegates. In addition, 23 at-large delegates will be elected by the state party committee in April in proportion to the primary outcome; then there are 14 party leaders, 18 superdelegates and 2 unpledged delegates who will go to the national convention in Denver this summer.
 Supporters of Mr. Obama also insist that even though the party establishment is helping Mrs. Clinton in the field, that advantage is not nearly as great as it would be in a general election, when union members work phone banks and the party pays workers on Election Day to get voters to the polls.
 ''Organizational support doesn't mean as much in a primary, when it's a fight among family,'' Senator Adler said. ''The party wants to save money for the general election.'' 
 But the Clinton campaign has said that Governor Corzine was instrumental in helping raise the $600,000 it has on hand for get-out-the vote efforts.
 At the rally here on Tuesday, which was packed with college students and union loyalists, many in the crowd said they were impressed with Mrs. Clinton's record as a senator and mastery of an array of issues, and considered it a bonus that she could break a gender barrier. Some, like Katie Battle, 24, said she also found reassurance in the fact that the former president would be by her side as a counselor. 
 ''If you think about it, in the 1990s we were doing a lot better than we are now,'' said Ms. Battle, who drove from nearby Bellmawr to see Mr. Clinton. ''So if she gets in there, she'll have him to turn to for advice. She'll be like a clone.''
 Mr. Obama's campaign director in New Jersey, Mark Alexander, said many Democrats were ready to move on from the Clinton years. Since last February, Obama supporters have been organizing a grass-roots network that has grown to include thousands of volunteers. While Mr. Obama does exceptionally well in the polls among blacks, he has also drawn significant support on college campuses. 
 Mr. Alexander said, ''There's an excitement and a level of commitment that you can feel growing.'' 
 Still, race is viewed by many observers as the ultimate wild card, particularly after Mr. Clinton's comments about Mr. Obama's victory in South Carolina.
 ''It's a sign that they're desperate,'' State Senator Shirley Turner said in speaking in support of Mr. Obama at a news conference on Monday. 
 But the Rev. Reginald Jackson, the head of the Black Ministers Council of New Jersey who supports Mrs. Clinton, said that however artless Mr. Clinton's comments might have been, they were mild compared with the kind of attacks that can be expected in a general election. 
 ''To be frank with you, I think long term it has a benefit regardless of which one is going to be the nominee because the Republicans are going to come after whoever the nominee is. I think this is like spring training,'' he said.
 Mr. Clinton avoided any provocative statements during his appearance Tuesday, and many party leaders say they hope that race will be no more important in this primary than in other recent elections. Surveying the raucous crowd at Mr. Clinton's rally, Assembly Speaker Joseph Roberts said he was confident that New Jersey's diverse demographics and the timing of this year's primary would encourage the campaigns to focus on issues like the environment, health care, the shaky economy and the war in Iraq.

HEADLINE: House Passes Aid Package, But Senate's Plan Differs

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN; Carl Hulse contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The House voted on Tuesday to approve a $146 billion fiscal stimulus package, hoping to seal a fast-paced deal with President Bush on tax rebates and business incentives intended to jolt the economy with new spending. 
 But the deal, which would be the most striking show of bipartisan cooperation since Democrats won control of Congress in 2006, was at risk as Senate Democrats forged ahead with their own, more expensive plan and jockeyed over what to include in it. 
 The House plan was approved by an overwhelming vote of 385 to 35. Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the Republican leader, Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, immediately called on the Senate to adopt the House bill without changes, as did President Bush when he was signing an executive order at the White House.
 ''The temptation is going to be for the Senate to load it up,'' Mr. Bush said. ''My concern is that we need to get this bill out of the Senate and on my desk so the checks can get in the hands of our consumers, and our businesses can be assured of the incentives necessary to make investments.'' 
 But there was little indication that the Senate would simply bow to the lower chamber. 
 Instead, Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana and chairman of the Finance Committee, advanced a $163 billion stimulus package that he said was better, despite warnings from House leaders and the White House that he could derail the agreement or plunge the nation too far in debt, so the money to pay for the stimulus would have to be borrowed. 
 And while the one-year difference in cost of the two plans would seem to be $17 billion, House officials criticized the Senate for trying to blur the full price tag by pushing some expenses into 2009. That would make the two-year cost of the Senate package almost $196 billion compared to almost $161 billion for the House version. 
 Both plans focus on personal tax rebates and incentives for businesses intended to spur spending. The Senate plan also extends unemployment benefits for 13 weeks beyond the 26 weeks currently provided in most states -- at a cost of $10 billion in 2008. 
 And it drops a component of the House package that would raise the limit on so-called ''conforming'' mortgages that can be insured by the Federal Housing Administration or bought by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored finance companies -- a step that would help homeowners in expensive markets refinance their loans. 
 The majority leader, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, said the bill would be on the floor by late Wednesday and was likely to be approved this week. And he said he remained confident that there would be a good deal, despite the continued jockeying by senators, who he said had made at least 15 competing requests to add components to the plan by amending the bill.
 Among the potential amendments were ones to give more money to food banks, to increase food stamps temporarily, to increase subsidies for home heating and other energy costs for low-income families, to adopt alternative energy tax credits and to finance infrastructure projects. 
 In a sign of how Senate Democrats were still wrangling over exactly how to structure the package, Mr. Reid said he strongly opposed a Baucus proposal to give tax rebates even to the wealthiest filers, unlike the House plan, which set caps on eligibility. 
 ''To take out the caps,'' Mr. Reid said, ''it's causing me to want to gag, O.K.?'' 
 Mr. Reid pointed out that, without the caps, even members of Congress would get the rebates, which Democrats have said they want directed to middle-class Americans. 
 ''I think it would send the wrong message to spend an extra $5 billion to give me a rebate,'' Mr. Reid said. ''I'm not going to spend the money. I think it's wrong. I think Warren Buffett should not have the rebate, and I'm totally opposed to it.'' 
 The White House and House leaders had said that one of the advantages of their stimulus plan was its simplicity. 
 It calls for tax rebates of up to $600 for individuals and $1,200 for couples, with the payments phased out for individuals earning more than $75,000 and couples earning more than $150,000. 
 It would provide a minimum payment of $300 for individuals paying less than that in income taxes who show earned income of at least $3,000. And it would provide an additional payment of $300 a child for all families receiving a payment. 
 On the business side, the House plan would give companies a 50 percent bonus deduction on new equipment that would normally be depreciated over many years. And it would double the limit on expenses to $250,000 from $125,000 that small businesses can deduct from annual income, with a total cap of $800,000. 
 Mr. Baucus said that he, too, wanted a simple stimulus plan. ''I do not want to load it up with lots of other provisions,'' he said. 
 He denied suggestions that he was complicating things by proposing a rival plan that would have to be reconciled with the measure adopted by the House. 
 ''Oh, no, no,'' Mr. Baucus said when asked if he was complicating the package. ''Someone could say the sky is purple, too. That's not accurate. What we're doing is we're making it work better.'' 
 He said the Senate rebate plan was more straightforward, providing payments of $500 for individuals, $1,000 for couples filing jointly and an additional $300 a child, with no income cap. 
 The Senate plan would also send $500 checks to some 20 million Americans over the age of 62 who live only on Social Security benefits and would not have qualified for payments under the House proposal. 
 The Senate also structures its business tax breaks differently and would give businesses the added ability to deduct losses from up to five years ago. Current law allows businesses to deduct losses from only two years ago. 
 Ms. Pelosi had initially sought an extension of jobless benefits and an increase in food stamps, but dropped those demands in favor of an agreement to provide $28 billion in one-time payments to more than 35 million families that would not otherwise have qualified for income-tax rebates. 
 But on Tuesday, Ms. Pelosi said that her own support for some of the proposals being floated in the Senate was secondary to the urgent need to secure a short-term stimulus plan, without vastly increasing the national debt.
 ''I don't want anything that's done in the Senate, as much as I would support many of those initiatives, to do any harm to what we have done in our rebate package,'' Ms. Pelosi said. ''It doesn't mean that all of those initiatives are not worthy, and in fact, I advocated for them myself. But instead we got a package that we could agree upon and move quickly with.'' 
 Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, said he, too, supported swift adoption of the House plan. 
 ''I hope that will be possible,'' Mr. McConnell said. ''This is not a time to get into some kind of testing of wills between the two Congressional bodies. This is a time to show that we can rise above partisanship, do something important and do it quickly.''

HEADLINE: DeCamp Bus Line No. 66 From the Port Authority to Upper Montclair, N.J.

BYLINE: By BILLIE COHEN

 BODY:
Every weekday in January, Billie Cohen is documenting a different commute for NYTimes.com/realestate. Here is a listing of all the articles in the Next Stop series. 
 9 p.m., Jan. 29 Tuesday
Montclair, N.J., is a town of options. ''There are three middle school choices, and they are all good,'' said Robert Smith, a father of two and a professor at CUNY. A year ago, Mr. Smith and his wife moved there from the Bronx, because their children were nearing middle-school age, and they weren't happy with city schools. 
 Although it was the major reason for the Smith family's move, education is not the only category in which Montclair offers decent choices. The commute is another: residents have easy access to both the bus and the train. (And if they choose rail, they can select from among six train stations in the township.) 
 While the train is the more popular mode in the morning, the bus still has a strong following -- especially at night -- when it runs more frequently. Tuesday night's bus at 9 p.m. was packed largely with professionals, couples and 20-something singles. 
 At the Port Authority, Patricia Cronin was first in line at the gate. She moved from Battery Park City to what she jokingly referred to as ''the Upper West Side of the suburbs'' 14 years ago. ''Our son was a year old and we wanted to raise him in the suburbs,'' she said. 
 The commute played a large role in where she and her husband considered living. ''We took a map and looked at train schedules for Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North,'' she said, explaining how she and her husband had narrowed their home search to Montclair. ''I work long hours and my husband works in Midtown, and we didn't want to commute more than one and a half hours all in.''
 Ms. Cronin said that she used to take the train, but has switched to the bus because it offers more frequent and more convenient service in the evening. ''Most of theses buses will stop at whatever corner you ring.''
 Last night's certainly did. People signaled for personal bus stops every few minutes, and the bus easily pulled to the side of the charming, tree-lined residential main road. Despite the apparent ease of the post-rush-hour commute -- peak times are a different, traffic-filled story -- the DeCamp bus line has lost many passengers to New Jersey Transit's Midtown Direct service. 
 ''It's affected us dramatically,'' said Gary Pard, vice president of operations. ''We used to run 9,400 passengers a day.'' 
 In 2002, New Jersey Transit began rail service from Montclair to Midtown. ''When that opened we dropped to 7,200 a day. We've since regained some of those and are back to 7,600 a day.'' He acknowledged the convenience of the railroad and its imperviousness to traffic (bus delays, he said, are the most common complaint he hears), but attributed the slight rebound to the economy, the bus's schedule, and people's preference to avoid the hassle and expense of parking and driving.
 ''I've heard DeCamp has lost customers to the train, but I still struggle to get a seat on most days,'' Ms. Cronin said. ''But I think the bus is great.''
 Nicholas Genchi is also a bus fan. ''You have to pay for parking in Montclair,'' he said. ''Decamp runs on Grove Street; I don't have to worry about parking, I live right on Grove.'' An employee at HBO, Mr. Genchi, 25, recently bought a condo in Clifton, N.J., the town where he grew up. ''I looked in Clifton, Lyndhurst, Rutherford, Bellevue,'' he said. ''I looked mostly for location but also for commute. Most places didn't have bus or train stops as easily accessible as walking out the front door and walking to Grove Street.'' 
 Robert and Sean, a couple who commute from the Flatiron District (and asked that their last names not be used), also conducted a thorough search before settling on Montclair three months ago. After rattling off a list of potential communities they had considered -- Jersey City, Bronx, Yonkers, and ''everywhere in New York City'' -- Sean said they wound up in Montclair ''because we could get a plot of land for less than a one-bedroom in the city. Considerably less.'' They also knew friends living there already, and the commute seemed painless. 
 ''The commute was very important, but we probably didn't know exactly what it'd be like,'' Sean said. ''It's harder than we thought it'd be, but we're just getting used to it.'' 
 The change from their Brooklyn lifestyles and the complications of suburb-to-city traffic required an adjustment to their morning schedules. Robert now goes to work around 7 a.m. to avoid the rush, and Sean goes in late, around 9:30 a.m. They both travel home on the 9 p.m. bus.
 One thing they've learned so far is that despite having two separate commuting methods, those options are inextricably linked. ''When you commute from New Jersey, if one way is off, then all ways are affected,'' Sean noted. ''So if the train is not running, the bus is overcrowded.'' He noted that the bus is often overcrowded regardless of the train's status. But in the end, even with all the pros and cons of both Montclair commutes, it's still better to have a choice.
 Commute Time
 37 minutes
 At a Glance
 Thanks to pick-ups and drop-offs at nearly any requested corner along the route, DeCamp Bus Lines delivers Montclair-area residents almost to their doorsteps. Nevertheless, the company has lost riders to New Jersey Transit's Midtown Direct line. Montclair has six train stations for commuters to choose from, and the railroad isn't plagued by the same traffic delays that the bus is.
 Where It Goes
 The No. 66 bus line runs from the Port Authority to West Orange, N.J. It makes stops in Clifton, Montclair (including Montclair University), Upper Montclair, and West Orange.
 Strategies
 ''Live on the beginning or middle of the bus route so you can get a seat,'' said Sean, a recent Brooklyn transplant to Montclair. ''Standing is dangerous and we've seen people get thrown. The aisles get full, especially in the morning.'' 
 Trivia
 DeCamp Bus Lines is the oldest privately-owned bus company in the country. ''And proud of it,'' said Gary Pard, the vice president of operations, ''despite the complaints.'' By the end of March, he expects the company's Web site to be revamped to include route maps, fare schedules, online customer service and the ability to send traffic notices to subscribers -- the latter in the hopes of allaying the most common gripe, delays.
