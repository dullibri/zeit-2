HEADLINE: Immigrants Strain Chinatown's Resources

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS

 BODY:
Jenny Zeng left her home in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou 18 months ago. She was a teacher in an elementary school there. Now she works in a Chinatown garment factory, stitching together dresses that she later sees for sale along Canal Street.
''The pay is very cheap,'' Miss Zeng said. ''I start at 9 A.M. and finish at 6 P.M., six days a week. It's piecework, and I do it very slowly, so I take home only about $200.''
Bending over a sewing machine all day fills her with despair. ''I always feel very tired,'' she said. ''The workday is very long. In the garment factory, there are a lot of people who are engineers, but because they can't speak English, they just work in a garment factory.'' 
Chinatown was built on the backs of generations of people like Jenny Zeng - immigrants working long hours for small wages in garment factories and restaurant kitchens.
Now, though, fears of political and economic change in Asia have created a wave of new immigration to Chinese communities in New York and on the West Coast. And those crowds of newcomers are straining an already overburdened community, as even menial jobs become scarce and wages stay too low to buy much of a new life.
Many of those new arrivals come to America legally; uncounted others do not. Theirs is often a cycle of immigration that begins with a fistful of cash and a great deal of risk. Some pay as much as $30,000 to be smuggled into the United States; when they arrive they become little more than indentured servants, working for years to repay their debts.
''In our community, there is a lot of frustration,'' said Wing Lam, executive director of the Chinese Staff and Workers Association, a nonprofit group that trains immigrants for better jobs.
As a paper presented by Mr. Lam's group to the Dinkins administration says, ''More than ever before, Chinese workers - old and new immigrants - are being locked into a segregated cheap labor market where wages are often below minimum-wage levels, along with extremely long hours, no benefits, no job security and little chance for advancement.''
The immigrants come not only from China itself, but from places like Taiwan, Malaysia and Hong Kong.
''One factor is the Hong Kong situation, what will happen in 1997,'' when the colony is returned to Chinese rule, said Betty Lee Sung, chairwoman of the Asian studies department at City College. ''Another is in Taiwan, where people are again fearful about Taiwan being reunited with China. Then there is the Tiananmen Square situation, so all of this pressure is creating a huge immigration influx.''
The most recent available statistics for legal immigrants from China show a steady climb, from 24,787 in 1985 to 28,717 in 1988, said Duke Austin, a spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service in Washington.
It is impossible to count the illegal immigrants, but the number of mainland Chinese apprehended has risen from 196 in 1987 to 984 last year, Mr. Austin said, and there are clearly far more than are caught.
The illegal immigrants fall into two main groups: those who overstay their tourist visas and those who are smuggled in. The smuggling networks, based in China and Hong Kong, charge as much as $30,000 a person and make few guarantees. Investigators have intercepted would-be immigrants from China at points from the Buffalo area to northern Washington State to the Mexican border.
 
'We Never Saw Them Again'
''Three years ago we had 13 of them come up through Mexico,'' Mr. Austin said. ''We set bond at $10,000 apiece. A guy showed up with a bag of money, counted it out and took off with them. We never saw them again.'' Last year, four people drowned after their raft overturned in the turbulent Niagara River near Buffalo. They were on the last leg of a journey each of them had paid at least $5,000 to make, investigators said.
''They are becoming more sophisticated,'' said John J. Ingham, the service's district director in Buffalo. ''We had other rafters in that same location, where the smugglees were using cellular phones to stay in contact with their pickup, who was waiting in a car on the other side.''
Traditionally, Chinese immigrants had relatives or friends who were their connections once they arrived in New York. But that has begun to change, in particular with people from Fujian Province in southeast China, which is home to many of the newcomers.
 
Who Runs Smuggling Networks
While the smugglers seldom provide immigration documents as part of the fee, fake ones can be bought.
Simon Chow, director of the refugee program at Hamilton-Madison House, a social-service agency in Chinatown, said travel agencies in Chinatown were supplying people with fake ''green cards,'' which are issued to aliens who have permanent-resident status.
Investigators say they have little information about who runs the smuggling networks, and people who are intercepted seldom seem to know anything about the hierarchy. But while many immigrants must find jobs on their own, others have jobs waiting for them, set up by the networks.
''Our concern is, obviously these people don't have that kind of money,'' Mr. Ingham said of the smugglers' fees. ''What happens to them is a form of indentured servitude. They get a job at a restaurant somewhere at wages that would take them many, many years to pay that kind of debt. The alternative is to pay it off more quickly by becoming involved with more illicit activities.''
Mr. Chow told of an unusual case in which an 18-year-old told him he couldn't take it anymore and was turning himself in to the authorities. ''He was working in a restaurant, running errands,'' and did not feel it was worth the pressure, Mr. Chow said.
 
Sat There All Day
Lately, finding even a job like that has become tougher.
''It's so difficult, because so many people want to come here,'' said Yi Tong, owner of the Dong Mei employment agency on East Broadway in Chinatown. One day early this month, her waiting room was filled with men, many of whom had sat there all day, waiting for a call from a restaurant, a construction foreman or a shop owner who needed a temporary or full-time helper. Most of the men, their faces bronzed from years of outdoor work, sat with their heads in their hands.
Ms. Yi said wages for ''kitchen men,'' who prepare food for cooking, are often as low as $400 a month; dishwashers earn as much as $900. People who cannot speak English cannot work as waiters, and so have no chance to augment their income with tips. Because New York City seems saturated, many people are forced to commute to suburban restaurants, she said.
On a recent day, a 29-year-old graduate of the Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute, who has an engineering degree, was running between three employment agencies on East Broadway and Eldridge Street. He was a native of Shanghai and was trying to find a job where his skills could be useful. One agency had placed him in the kitchen of a Chinatown restaurant, but he hated it. ''I quit after one day,'' said the man, who did not want his name used.
 
Lessons in English
The situation is reflected in a textbook called ''English for Practical Living,'' sold in Chinatown. Under the heading ''Parts of Speech,'' a short list of nouns starts out with: immigrant, waiter, wife, seamstress. It ends with factory, restaurant, Laundromat.
Even those who have been in America for years are being strained by the new immigration.
''There are a lot of undocumented aliens here now, and jobs are hard to get,'' said a father of three, who works six days a week, 10 hours a day, in a restaurant and takes home $300.
The garment factories that honeycomb Chinatown are for the immigrant Chinese women what the restaurants are for the men.
 
Half Are Illegal Immigrants
There are about 1,500 registered factories, most with corporate owners, said Hugh McDaid, program administrator for the state's Apparel Industry Task Force. Typically they employ about 40 people, and like small factories in other parts of the city, they draw heavily on immigrant labor and have been the targets of inspectors trying to enforce fair labor standards.
It is not the inspectors' job to ask about workers' immigration status, but Mr. McDaid estimates that about half the employees are illegal immigrants.
Both legal and illegal immigrants are exploited, ''because no one else will take these jobs,'' said Paul Kalka, one of the inspectors. ''One shop we found on Division Street, the owner sponsored his whole town and they're working for him now.''
On the fourth floor of a building on Elizabeth Street, 50 Chinese women and a couple of men employed by the Hong Fong Sportswear company are hunched over their work: sorting piles of pre-cut fabrics, sewing elastic bands on evolving trousers, snipping threads from finished products, shoving clothes on hangers onto wheeled racks. Fans whir and Cantonese opera whines over a loudspeaker. Thick clots of dust line the boxes where time cards are supposed to be, and the clock stopped long ago. The women wear improvised dust masks, pieces of white fabric draped over their ears and noses. The windows are barred with iron gates, and the fire door is blocked by boxes and a metal bar.
 
'She Earns $60 a Week'
''I've never seen a worse fire exit,'' Mr. Kalka said. Referring to the Triangle Shirtwaist fire, which killed 146 workers in 1911, he said, ''The only thing worse about Triangle was they actually had them locked in.''
One investigator, Andy Chan, interviewed a woman in her 60's who was snipping threads from a stack of pullovers. ''She comes here 10 to 5, Monday through Friday, and 10 to 6 on Saturday,'' he said. ''She earns $60 a week.''
State law requires that even if workers are paid by the piece, their hourly wage must equal the minimum wage, $3.80, said Joseph Halik, a supervisor on the task force, as one of the inspectors wrote up a citation for the factory's owner, who had no employee records.
Two floors up, at Kwong Fong Sportswear, a worker named Yi Jian was asked when she came to New York. ''1982, she replied.'' So did everyone else who was asked. The cutoff year for the Federal Government's amnesty for illegal aliens was 1982.
 
'It's Not Completely Hopeless'
Often, an entire family will work in a factory and still struggle to make ends meet. They work for hours and days that turn into months and years.
''These are basic, bottom-level jobs that don't pay too much, mean long hours and there's not much mobility,'' said Professor Sung. ''Except that if you work in a garment factory for a while, you may say, 'Let me start my own factory.' It enables them to go into business for themselves if they save up their money. So it's not completely hopeless.''
In Lesson Two of ''English for Practical Living,'' students learn the word ''hope.'' The practice sentences range from ''I have hope in my heart'' to ''Do you have hope?'' and finally, what may be closest to the truth, ''I put my hope on my children.''

HEADLINE: Bradley, Though Popular, Chases Re-election on Tiptoe

BYLINE: By PETER KERR

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
After two terms in the United States Senate and years of speculation about running for President sometime, Bill Bradley has gained extraordinary popularity in New Jersey, politicians of both parties say. But as he runs for re-election, he is showing a distinct strain of caution.
Republican critics say Mr. Bradley hardly needs his war chest of more than $9 million to defeat Christene Todd Whitman, the little-known and poorly financed Republican expected to face him in the fall. It is a bit unseemly, they suggest, for an advocate of campaign spending reform to be criss-crossing the country tapping Democratic contributors on both coasts. 
New Jersey Democrats, proud of their Senator's reputation as an expert on fiscal matters and Soviet affairs, say Mr. Bradley offers what the national party these days so often lacks: a star vote-getter with the aura of celebrity. Yet some suggest Mr. Bradley's Senate campaign, based on the themes of children and the environment, also demonstrates one of the party's weaknesses: a reluctance to go beyond politically safe issues to define a distinctly Democratic vision of the nation's future.
''In Bill Bradley there is that amorphous quality of the star,'' said Representative Robert Torricelli, a Democrat from Bergen County. ''But as his influence grows, many people believe he should use it to question assumptions and test new ideas.''
In 1988, saying the time was not right, Mr. Bradley turned down entreaties from Democrats to run for President. This year, announcing his re-election bid, he indicated he would stay in the Senate rather than run for President in 1992.
But the Presidency plays a powerful role in the campaign. Republicans, including Ms. Whitman, acknowledge that Mr. Bradley has been ''a good Senator.'' It is by the higher standards of a candidate for national office that they find him lacking.
Many politicians say New Jersey's Republicans recruited Ms. Whitman to run on behalf of the national party. Its strategists in Washington don't believe she will beat him, but they hope she will scar him - rob him of the overwhelming victory that would make him look like Presidential material.
''You can't have a President who constantly tests the wind before he takes a stand on an issue,'' Ms. Whitman said recently. ''I don't think he is as good as the aura that has built up around him.''
If she succeeds, aides to Governor Jim Florio watching the race say, Ms. Whitman will be well-known, and she has other ambitions. An oft-repeated quip in Trenton is: ''This race isn't really for the Senate. One's running for President and one's running for governor.''
But to Mr. Bradley, the 1990 campaign is a chance to explain to voters his accomplishments on behalf of New Jersey, his work in Congress that constituents rarely learn about from national political reporting.
''New Jersey happens to have 25 percent of its land mass under the jurisdiction of the joint Federal-State control of the Pinelands,'' he said in a recent interview in his Washington office. ''It's an area where I have worked since I first came here. Every year.''
In addition to his efforts to preserve parkland and protect the health and opportunities of New Jersey children, he stressed the connection between life in New Jersey and his work on foreign affairs, particularly the Soviet Union.
If the Soviets ''are heading in a direction they necessarily must go - lower defense spending and reforms in the economy - that frees up resources here,'' Mr. Bradley said. ''That means there is more money to clean up water in New Jersey. That means there is more money to invest in education in New Jersey.''
 
Princeton Basketball Star
Mr. Bradley first came to the attention of the New Jersey public a quarter century ago as a six-foot-five-inch basketball star at Princeton.
Besides his athletic prowess derived from ceaseless discipline, he played a game of intuition and intelligence.
One could discern that, John McPhee wrote in The New Yorker in 1965, particularly when he did not have the ball.
''He would swim in and out around the basket, back and forth, making plans and abandoning them, always watching the distant movement of the ball out of the corner of his eye,'' Mr. McPhee wrote.
Mr. Bradley's talents took him to England as a Rhodes Scholar and then to New York, where he played for a decade with the New York Knickerbockers. Immediately following his retirement in 1978, he ran and unexpectedly won in his first race, for a seat in the United States Senate.
 
Tax Simplification Plan
In Congress, he captured national attention with his efforts to develop a tax simplification plan, much of which was included in the successful 1986 Tax Reform Act, and from his command of Third World debt problems. In 1984, he won re-election with 65 percent of the vote.
Since then he has received strong support from Wall Street, despite aspects of his tax-reform legislation that took away the lower tax rate on capital gains. He has also retained strong support from liberals, despite a 1986 vote to aid the Nicaraguan contra rebels.
Ms. Whitman, a 43-year-old former president of the State Board of Public Utilities, attracted publicity by calling on Mr. Bradley to spend no more than $3 million on the race.
She argues in campaign stops around the state that since Mr. Bradley has supported Federal legislation to limit campaign spending, he is in a position to set a good example. Ms. Whitman expects to raise $1.5 million.
 
Little Political Risk
''I believe in being prepared'' Mr. Bradley said during the Washington interview. He raised more than $9 million, he said, because he didn't know who the Republicans would run against him or how much the national party might spend.
Speaking with a boyish, bemused smile, Mr. Bradley sketched his view of an emerging new borderless world, with the Soviet Union in eclipse, Asia on the rise, and American power dependent upon its ability to educate its young.
But he took little political risk, neither advocating programs that would cost much money or veering very far from the agenda already set by President Bush.
When asked what kind of increased role he wanted the Federal Government to take in education, he cautioned that he wished to protect local control and that there was not much more Federal money available this year.
 
Ad Hoc Industrial Policy
''I think we can spend more,'' he said. ''The question is how much more in the world that has been created by the last nine years of government in Washington.''
Asked about a national industrial policy, he said he doubted the term had any meaning.
''Everybody plans, but what does that mean?'' he said. ''We had an ad hoc industrial policy for 50 years; it was called the tax code. Whoever had a favored lobbyist to get in a special-interest loophole got a chunk of the action.''
And when asked if he supported a Federal tax increase, he said he would answer only if the President asked for his advice.
''I could answer that in terms of policy, but he hasn't called me to ask for my advice,'' Mr. Bradley said. ''I'll save my advice for the President.''

HEADLINE: Daily News to Lay Off 17 of Its 49 Machinists

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The Daily News announced the layoff of 17 machinists yesterday as it continued bargaining over expired contracts.
The News said that because of reduced advertising revenues, 17 of 49 jobs would be eliminated effective on Saturday and that the workers would receive two to six weeks' pay, as well as three months' medical insurance. 
''By terms of the existing agreements, management is permitted to determine the manning level in this department,'' the vice president of human resources at The News, John T. Sloan, said. ''Our decision couldn't be further delayed in light of slowing economic conditions in the New York advertising marketplace.''
Mr. Sloan said letters had been sent to the employees, who maintain presses, giving them one week's notice.
''This is the beginning of the planned strategy of provoking the unions into strike action,'' said Theodore W. Kheel, an adviser to the Allied Printing Trades Council, which is made up of the 10 unions negotiating with The News. ''No doubt there will be more of the same sort to come.''
Mr. Kheel conceded that The News was apparently acting within the terms of a contract that expired in March.

Graduates At Baruch Hear Pole

 BODY:
The economist who is the Minister of the Office of Central Planning in Poland's Solidarity-led Government told more than 2,300 graduating students of Bernard M. Baruch College yesterday that they should ''go beyond symbols and work to integrate the free world - East and West.''
The Minister, Jerzy Osiatynski, was one of three to receive honorary degrees at the 24th commencement of Baruch, one of the 13 senior colleges that, along with seven community colleges, make up the City University of New York. He was cited as an academic and a public policy advocate. The commencement was held in the grand ballroom of the New York Hilton Hotel. 
Mr. Osiatynski, who lectured in March to students at Baruch's School of Business and Public Administration, the largest in the nation, urged the graduating students to ''help create networks that will link the United States and Eastern Europe in the development of free-market economies'' there.
 
Ambassador Is Honored
The two other honorary degrees went to Harriet R. Michel, executive director of the New York Foundation and a member of the New York City Charter Revision Commission, and Michael Sotirhos, a businessman and graduate of Baruch who is United States Ambassador to Greece. She was cited as a civic leader and he as a public servant.
Joel Segall presided at his last Baruch commencement before retiring after 13 years as the college's president.
He announced his resignation in April after Baruch was threatened with losing its accreditation by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools for not having hired enough minorities for teaching and administrative jobs and for not providing enough support to minority students. The accreditation issue was not alluded to yesterday.
 
Hunter College
Hunter College awarded an honorary degree to Dr. Robert Davila, the assistant secretary of the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services of the Federal Department of Education, during its 161st commencement exercises last night.
Dr. Davila, a Hunter graduate whose speech was translated into sign language as it was delivered, is the first deaf person to hold the special education office. He told the 1,200 undergraduates and 680 graduates at Hunter that improvements in education would not occur without controversy.
''Honest differences of opinion are the lifeblood of a democracy,'' he said. ''We must work to transform these controversies into opportunities for collaboration.''
Dr. Davila also stressed the importance of equality in education for children with disabilities.
At the ceremony, which took place in the Grand Ballroom of the New York Hilton Hotel, honorary degrees were also awarded to Mary Johnson Lowe, a Federal District Court judge, and Eugene Lang, the philanthropist who started the ''I Have a Dream'' program, which provides college scholarships to underprivileged students.

 CORRECTION:
An article on May 30 about the 24th commencement of Baruch College in New York misstated the role of an honorary-degree recipient, Harriet R. Michel, with the New York Foundation. She was executive director of the foundation until 1977; the executive director since 1978 has been Madeline Lee. LEAD: An article on Wednesday about the 24th commencement of Baruch College in New York referred incompletely to an honorary-degree recipient, Harriet R. Michel. She is president of the National Minority Supplier Development Council, which promotes minority business development.

HEADLINE: Eating Well

BYLINE: By MARIAN BURROS

 BODY:
THIS is the Federal Government's version of a riddle: When is fresh not fresh?
The Food and Drug Administration has yet to find an answer, and the process is coming to resemble a Jell-O wrestling match. The agency defines ''fresh'' in the negative: as a term that ''should not be applied to foods which have been subjected to any form of heat or chemical processing.''
It sounds simple enough. But the agency permits the Campbell Soup Company to use the name Prego Spaghetti Sauce With Fresh Mushrooms, though the sauce is processed with heat to keep it from spoiling on the shelf. It permits Citrus World, a Florida company, to call a pasteurized orange juice Fresh and Natural. The F.D.A. did not question the use of the term fresh when the products were introduced several years ago. Nor has the agency questioned several hundred other heat-processed foods with ''fresh'' in their names. 
But in September 1989, when Ragu Foods introduced its Fresh Italian line of pasta sauces, some of its competitors cried foul. They wrote to the F.D.A., to several state officials and to Congress, complaining that the labeling was misleading.
The competitors, Campbell Soup and the California Fresh-Pack Coalition, a group of seven tomato packers, say the word ''fresh'' gives Ragu an unfair advantage. Capitalizing on the enormous interest in fresh foods in this country, Ragu's television commercials for the Fresh Italian sauces show fresh tomatoes, sliced and dripping. The theme is ''more crushed tomatoes for more fresh tomato taste.''
Ragu defends its terminology and its product, although last week it did offer to modify the name slightly. ''It is Ragu's position,'' Eileen Sharkey, the company's director of communications for the company, said in an interview last week, that the labeling ''meets F.D.A. and U.S.D.A. requirements.'' Besides, she added, ''No one has presented any evidence that consumers are misled that this is a fresh, unprocessed product.''
The competitors argue that the difference between their claims to freshness and Ragu's is significant. ''We use fresh mushrooms when we make the sauce,'' said Robert Subin, a Campbell vice president, ''and the California packers use fresh tomatoes.''
In other words, the mushrooms and the tomatoes are fresh when they are put in the can or jar; only then are they heat-processed. Ragu, the competitors argue, uses tomatoes that have already been heat-processed before they go into the sauce.
The competitors have engaged a public relations firm, Northwest Strategies, to help make their case. In a news release, the firm quoted from a letter to the F.D.A. by Linda F. Golodner, executive director of the National Consumers League, an advocacy group:
''Describing a heat-processed, remanufactured product as fresh flies in the face of reason, is clearly intended to mislead consumers and violates existing F.D.A. policy. F.D.A. should require manufacturers to distinguish between a product made from fresh tomatoes and that made from reproduced tomato paste. This would be consistent with F.D.A.'s requirement that a distinction be made between orange juice made from fresh oranges and juice made from concentrate.''
What concerns consumer groups is the possibility of economic deception. ''Apparently some consumers believe this product is superior to those that don't carry the fresh label,'' said Bruce Silverglade, legal director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer advocacy group. ''We sympathize with the aggrieved competitors.''
But Mr. Silverglade said neither Prego nor the California Fresh-Pack group had any more right to the term fresh than Ragu did. ''Fresh-packed,'' he said, ''is an oxymoron.'' ''The prevalence of fresh claims is indicative of how long the problem has festered,'' he went on. ''Lackadaisical enforcement of food labeling hurts competitors as much as consumers.''
And that is where the F.D.A. comes in. In August 1989, New York State sent a warning to Ragu, accusing it of deceptive labeling. It threatened ''immediate quarantine and possible further legal action'' if the product was sold in New York. Other states, including Texas and Florida, threatened similar action. But Dennis E. Baker, director of the Division of Food and Drugs at the Texas Department of Health, said the state was waiting to see what the F.D.A. did.
On April 3 the F.D.A. sent Ragu a letter charging not only that the term fresh was misleading but also that the use of the word Italian ''falsely implies a geographical origin of the food.''
On April 20 Ragu replied that ''Fresh Italian'' was a trade name, not a description of the product. Last week, in a compromise, it offered to add the word ''brand'' to the name, making it Ragu Fresh Italian Brand. On institutional cans it would add some variation of the phrase ''Made from remanufactured tomatoes.'' The F.D.A. has said that it will make a decision very soon.
Last week, Ms. Sharkey, citing other heat-processed products that use the word fresh, said: ''If F.D.A. has a problem with fresh, we should not be singled out for regulatory action. If F.D.A. would like to change the rules, we have no problem with that.''
And that is the Jell-O wrestling match in which the F.D.A. is engaged.
Raymond Newberry, deputy director of the agency's division of regulatory guidance, is writing a regulation to cover the use of the word fresh. He acknowledged that there were other misleading uses, but said Ragu's use was ''false and egregious.''
Further confusing the issue, not just for consumers but for producers, are United States Department of Agriculture regulations for products that contain meat or poultry. Last year the department changed its regulations to allow poultry to be called fresh unless it is chilled to zero degrees Fahrenheit in processing. Even though poultry starts to freeze at 26 degrees, there is no consensus on when it is completely frozen, the Agriculture Department says.
In addition, the department allows processed meats and poultry sold in refrigerated cases, like cooked chicken nuggets and chicken salads, to be called fresh. And the department permits the word fresh as part of a trademark or company name as long as it is clear that the product is not really fresh.
''There's no question labeling in general is a mess,'' said Maurice Guerrette, director of food inspection services for the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets. ''It's in a mess because it has been neglected. There's an awful lot of misleading stuff out there and it's impossible to straighten out at the state level. The signal going out from the F.D.A. and U.S.D.A. is that labeling is a low priority and it has been the green flag to do anything.
''People really care about labeling,'' he continued. ''They care more about it than sanitary conditions. New labeling regulations from the F.D.A. would help a lot.''
For consumers, there are some important lessons. As a general rule, no matter what the label says about freshness, any product in a can or a jar that is not refrigerated was certainly processed in some fashion to preserve it. The only reason to pay more for one such canned product over another is flavor, not freshness.
On the other hand, if a food has been heat-processed yet is stored in the refrigerator section of the supermarket, it is certainly fresher than one that has been heat-processed to guarantee a long shelf life. It may cost more than a shelf-stable product in a can or jar, and it may well be worth the money.

HEADLINE: China Gets One Loan, but Another Is Put Off

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 29

 BODY:
The World Bank today approved a $300 million loan to help China combat deforestation but indefinitely postponed a second loan of $150 million for roads and waterways that had been opposed by the Bush Administration.
The deferral was engineered by the Administration after it found that it could not muster enough votes to block the loan at today's board meeting in Washington.
Both loans had been hotly debated by some members of Congress, who had urged the Administration to prevent the World Bank from making the loans, warning that other initiatives intended to help the third world and Eastern Europe would be in jeopardy.
Today's loan was the largest approved by the World Bank since the crackdown against pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing's Tiananmen Square last June. At that time, the 152-nation World Bank, the largest source of aid to the third world, announced that it was cutting full-scale lending to China. It had been providing China with nearly $2 billion a year, equivalent to about 10 percent of its total annual lending. 
Under the World Bank's president, Barber B. Conable Jr., the institution now wants to resume normal lending to China. The bank argues that it is not a political institution and that the loans it brings to the board are justified by sound economic criteria, but this policy has fostered opposition from both the Bush Administration and Congressional critics of the Beijing Government.
It was largely to appease such critics that the Administration fought against the transportation loan, which would have been used to upgrade roads and waterways in Jiangsu province north of Shanghai. The Administration's position is that loans should go forward to China only if they meet basic criteria to alleviate poverty.
It supported the forestation loan, which is to lead to the planting of trees in 15 provinces, a Treasury official said, on the ground that this would generate signficant part-time seasonal employment for poor rural farm families. Also, the loan would increase supplies of wood used by peasants for cooking and heating.
The official also noted that the loan would have environmental benefits by increasing the forest cover of China and helping control soil erosion.
While the Administration has tried to block some loans to China, President Bush announced last week that the United States was renewing Beijing's normal trade status. The President said he acted because ''economic contacts are the best way to keep the economic reforms going forward.''
 
Concerned About Retaliation
He also said he was concerned about retaliation against the $6 billion a year the United States sells to China and the impact that new trade barriers would have on Hong Kong, through which most Chinese goods bound for the United States pass.
The United States, as the leading World Bank stockholder, votes about 20 percent of the shares. But a simple majority is necessary to block a loan.
Three Democrats in the House warned in a letter to Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady last week that if the two China loans went forward, the Administration's request for more aid for both the third world and Eastern Europe could be held up.
 
'Poisoned' Political Atmosphere
The three, Representative Henry B. Gonzalez of Texas, who is the chairman of the House Banking Committee; Walter E. Fauntroy, the District of Columbia delegate who is chairman of the banking panel's international development and finance subcommittee, and David R. Obey of Wisconsin, chairman of the appropriations subcommittee on foreign operations, wrote: ''We expect that the political atmosphere in the Congress will be poisoned to the point of making thorough analysis and consideration on the merits of these important initiatives extremely difficult.''
A banking subcommittee aide said that with only one of the loans passed, ''I don't know what the reaction will be on the Hill, but my guess is the initiatives are still in trouble.''
Earlier this year, the World Bank approved two other loans for China -$30 million for earthquake relief and $60 million for agricultural development. Because they fell into the basic human needs category, the Bush Administration went along, although it initially won a postponement of the farm loan.
 
Brady Asks Changes
WASHINGTON, May 29 (AP) -Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said today that third world countries must make changes in their economies quickly to compete with emerging Eastern European democracies for investors.
''The incentive for the developing countries to move ahead vigorously with reform efforts has taken on additional urgency since the emergence of Eastern Europe,'' Mr. Brady said in a speech to the American Chamber of Commerce in London that was released by the Treasury Department.
''In the aggressive worldwide competition for foreign investment, countries which fail to create an attractive investment environment run a real risk of lost opportunities and falling behind,'' he added.

HEADLINE: Price-Blind Smoker Loyalty Defies Economics and Critics

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
About two weeks ago, something happened that may subtly undermine the recent efforts of antismoking advocates: the tobacco industry raised cigarette prices and most smokers went along.
Indeed, every six months for the last several years, tobacco companies have quietly increased cigarette prices by about 5 percent. The average retail price of cigarettes was close to $1.50 a pack last year.
Such unheralded actions could undermine two developments last week that heartened the antismoking forces. 
Harvard University and City University of New York disclosed that they had sold the tobacco stocks in their investment portfolios, lending momentum to a divestiture movement modeled after the one aimed at ending apartheid in South Africa, by curbing stock purchases in companies with South African operations. Also last week, the Bush Administration sought new curbs on cigarette sales to minors, including state laws banning sales through vending machines.
But securities analysts say that as long as the industry can almost automatically raise prices, convince consumers to pay them, keep production efficiency high, and come out with new products like low-tar cigarettes that address health and other concerns, it will continue to enjoy vast profits despite declining sales.
A ban on advertising, long the object of attack by antismoking advocates, would lower companies' operating costs and further fatten their profits, said Emanuel Goldman, an analyst with Paine Webber Inc.
For the Philip Morris Companies, the industry leader and the maker of Marlboro, a total ban on advertising would result in an after-tax gain of nearly $575 million, Mr. Goldman said. That would be on top of estimated 1990 earnings of $3.5 billion.
''There is nothing more lucrative than those little white tubes,'' said John C. Maxwell, Jr., a longtime tobacco analyst at Wheat First Securities in Richmond.
The popularity of the tobacco business on Wall Street is not in doubt, although many analysts speak of the ''tobacco discount'' that keeps cigarette stocks from soaring higher. Philip Morris is a favorite among institutional investors. Of the 30 stocks that make up the Dow Jones industrial average, Philip Morris's stock was the second-best performer last year, after the Coca-Cola Company.
Philip Morris shares were unchanged yesterday, closing at $42.50 on the New York Stock Exchange.
''I doubt if Harvard's action will have any effect on us at all,'' said Scott H. Peterson, a spokesman for the Prudential Insurance Company of America, which holds tobacco shares among the $27.4 billion in stock that it manages.
 
Public Pressure
True, some large corporations have bowed to public pressure. After a consumer boycott, H. J. Heinz, the world's largest tuna canner, last month pledged to buy only tuna that is caught in ways that safeguard dolphins, which sometimes become entangled in tuna nets.
But antismoking advocates are attacking the fundamental business of the tobacco industry. In doing so, however, the tobacco opponents are not seeking to persuade companies to get out of the cigarette business.
''That would be like persuading the Medellin cartel to get out of drugs,'' said Philip M. Wilbur, a spokesman for the Advocacy Institute in Washington. ''That's not realistic. What we want to do is remove the legitimacy that makes it easier for the cigarette companies to sell cigarettes.''
Even that goal might be elusive. Some health researchers fear that as the number of smokers continues to fall, the hard-liners that remain will be more resistant to the antismoking message and thus be even more loyal tobacco consumers. In 1987, according to the most recent Federal survey, 28.8 percent of adults aged 18 and over were smokers, compared with 40 percent in 1964, when the Surgeon General warned that smoking causes cancer and heart disease.
 
Core of Heavy Smokers
''It may well be that lighter smokers have already quit, leaving many heavy smokers who are more reluctant to quit,'' said Dr. Ronald M. Davis, director of the Office on Smoking and Health in Rockville, Md. The evidence so far is inconclusive, because per-capita cigarette consumption has remained at about a pack a day between 1974 and 1987.
The fight over vending machine sales is especially important to smoking opponents, because 90 percent of smokers start before age 21, with half starting under 18, according to Federal surveys. Opponents of smoking see vending machines as an easy route for minors to buy cigarettes. ''If you could just postpone that period before 21 and make cigarettes less atttractive or less available, then maybe people wouldn't start at all,'' Dr. Davis said. For its part, the Amusement and Music Operators Association, a trade group for vending machine operators, said 70 percent of the nation's machines are in bars, factories and other places children rarely visit. A spokeswoman for the Tobacco Institute said the cigarette industry would not oppose restrictions on the 30 percent of machines that may be accessible to children.
The tobacco industry finds profitable opportunities despite, or maybe even because of, health concerns over cigarettes. Some of the best-selling products, for example, are low-tar cigarettes, which appeal to many smokers who want to quit.
 
Discount and Low-Tar Products
Last year, nearly 55 percent of the 524 billion cigarettes sold were low-tar, according to Mr. Maxwell of Wheat First. Signficantly, ultra-low-tar cigarettes, with 6 milligrams of tar or less, were 11.3 percent of the market, compared with 9.7 percent in 1985.
The rise in tobacco excise taxes has helped stimulate development of a lucrative new market niche - discount cigarettes. These ''price value'' cigarettes, which are new products from the current manufacturers, were 14.8 percent of the market last year, compared with 11.1 percent the year before, at a time when overall unit sales are declining.
Indeed, one of the fastest-growing cigarettes in industry history came from the smallest manufacturer, Liggett Group, which had sales in the year ended March 31 of about $570 million, nearly all from cigarettes. Pyramid, a discount brand introduced in late 1988, sold more than four billion cigarettes in 1989, an almost unheard-of performance for a new cigarette.
Most of the six American cigarette makers have installed the latest production equipment. RJR Nabisco's huge Tobaccoville plant, near Winston-Salem, N.C., can produce more than 117 billion cigarettes a year, or about 8,000 a minute.
The larger the market share, the longer the production run and the higher the profit margin and return.
Philip Morris, for example, had cigarette sales last year of $17.9 billion and the largest market share, with nearly 42 percent. With probably the highest margins, the company made almost 75 cents in operating income for every dollar of assets, higher than Coca-Cola's return on soft drinks of 41 cents.

HEADLINE: Jovanovich Resigns Harcourt Post

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

 BODY:
William I. Jovanovich, who slowly built Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc. into one of America's great publishing houses before abruptly miring it in overwhelming debt, resigned yesterday as chairman.
Mr. Jovanovich, who is 70 years old, was succeeded as chairman by John S. Herrington, the Secretary of Energy in the Reagan Administration. Mr. Herrington, a lawyer who joined the Harcourt board last year, has scant experience in publishing.
''I am a problem solver,'' Mr. Herrington said, adding that he would be concentrating on ways to meet the company's financial crisis.
He said that Mr. Jovanovich's son, Peter, who has been chief executive since last December and was named chairman of the executive committee yesterday, would run the company. 
 
An Industry in Turmoil
Mr. Jovanovich's unexpected resignation, after 36 years as chairman, capped a nine-month period of turmoil in the publishing industry. During that time, several top executives, including Robert L. Bernstein of Random House, departed as the industry consolidated and big publishing conglomerates struggled to achieve profits. Harcourt Brace resisted this consolidation process but at the price of placing itself in financial jeopardy.
The new management team will have to act fast. Burdened with $1.6 billion in debt, the company, based in Orlando, Fla., must quickly sell some assets, reschedule debt payments or secure an injection of capital in order to achieve a measure of financial stability, many analysts believe.
''I think Mr. Jovanovich's departure will help them move forward,'' said James Milliot, executive editor of BP Report, an industry newsletter. ''I have to think he was an obstacle to the asset sales which have to be pushed through.''
 
'Too Terrible for Words'
Ivan Obelensky, an analyst with Josephthal & Company, said: ''The situation is too terrible for words. The share price is just over $3, but right now it's not worth half that.''
In many ways, the difficulties of the older Mr. Jovanovich present a troubling parable of contemporary publishing. A fiercely independent man who built Harcourt from an $8 million company in 1954 to an enterprise with $1.3 billion in revenues today, he was outraged about the attempted takeover in 1987 by the British publisher Robert Maxwell, and he borrowed nearly $3 billion to fend off the raid.
Since then, Harcourt's fortunes have slumped. Interest payments on the company's debt totaled $350.8 million last year, and the company incurred an operating loss of $242 million in 1989.
 
From $63.75 a Share to $3.125
Its share price, which reached $63.75 during the 1987 takeover battle, has tumbled to $3.125. The stock closed unchanged yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange. Some shareholders have filed lawsuits accusing the company of artificially inflatiing its stock price by using false statements to conceal its debt burden.
Moreover, the sale last year of the company's theme parks, a move made necessary by the need to reduce debt, fetched a disappointing $1.1 billion. And the company's core textbook publishing business, which accounts for almost half of sales, has suffered problems, particularly in the school division, where the younger Mr. Jovanovich acknowledged that ''the company has not been as innovative as I would like in recent years.''
With the company facing these acute problems, many analysts saw the older Mr. Jovanovich as a once-inspired publisher who had become a stubborn force maneuvering to resist change. A self-made man born in a coal camp in Colorado, he was known for his iconoclastic ways, shunning the press and the industry's trade association while dominating the company.
 
Masterpieces and Textbooks
Having built an enterprise that published masterpieces like T. S. Elliot's ''Collected Poems,'' E. M. Forster's ''A Passage to India'' and Mary McCarthy's ''The Group'' while becoming America's leading textbook publisher for elementary and secondary schools, he appeared reluctant to countenance the draconian measures Harcourt Brace now seems to need, analysts said.
Roger Straus, chairman of Farrar, Straus & Giroux and one of the few survivors among the men who built American publishing houses, said: ''It is very sad. Bill was a great publisher in his time, but he went too far in resisting Maxwell. Now I suspect that he does not want to be there for the dismemberment.''
Peter Jovanovich, a 41-year-old Princeton graduate with a high reputation within the book industry, said, however, that the company was absolutely committed to maintaining its independence. ''My goal is to regain our editorial pre-eminence,'' he said, stressing the need for new school programs.
 
'The Overriding Issue'
Both he and Mr. Herrington declined to say how the company's debt problems would be confronted, although Mr. Herrington conceded this was ''the overriding issue.''
Already onerous, the company's annual debt payments, which will total at least $129 million this year, are set to increase in 1993 as other kinds of debt become due.
Analysts believe that a sale of the company's professional publishing division, which has sales of more than $200 million and includes the W. B. Saunders medical publishing unit, is possible and could fetch more than $600 million. But talks earlier this year with the Thomson Group of Canada came to nothing. The analysts said the company was probably also reviewing the future of its insurance unit, which had revenue last year of $456.3 million.
''The problem is: what do you sell and for how much?'' Mr. Obelensky, the analyst, said. ''The wagons have been circled. Whatever they sell, they reduce their cash flow for paying off the debt.'' He added that he believed Mr. Herrington, with his strong Republican business connections, might be preparing the way for an investment group to come in. But Mr. Herrington denied that he was.
Whatever Harcourt does, its current plight appears ironic to many in light of the fact that Macmillan Inc., which Mr. Maxwell ultimately took over, has fared comparatively well. ''I am afraid that if Maxwell came back with a $2-a-share offer for Harcourt today, there would be a stampede,'' Mr. Obelensky said.

Deficits Quack, Politicians Duck

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
IT walks like a budget duck, and it quacks like a budget duck. But should next year's outlay of $50 billion to $60 billion for the savings and loan bailout count as part of the Federal budget?
Washington's budget summiteers have a powerful motive for pushing this expense into the twilight zone: Without some sleight of hand, the prospects for negotiating the deficit down to the Gramm-Rudman target are virtually nil. And to the negotiators' relief, there is a good argument for ignoring the bailout in the Gramm-Rudman calculation. 
But as Robert Reischauer, director of the Congressional Budget Office, points out, what is sauce for the duck is sauce for the drake: The case for excluding the bailout deficit is identical to the case for counting the Social Security surplus. Intellectual consistency is thus the enemy of efforts to insulate surpluses in the pensioners' trust fund from the Federal pork barrel.
On first take, it seems self-evident that the bailout money should be treated like, say, the money the Air Force spends on salaries for pilots. In both cases, when tax revenues are insufficient to meet budgetary needs, the cash is borrowed from private investors, and then paid out to meet the Government's obligations.
In one sense, argues William Brainard, an economist at Yale University, this first take is the right take. The Federal budget is, among other things, a record of the way the Government changes the distribution of financial obligations in the economy. Huge transfers from private lenders to bank depositors certainly qualify.
But most economists use the budget numbers differently. While the size of the deficit may be an ambiguous barometer of the Government's fiscal stance, year-to-year changes in the deficit ought to offer insight into Washington's changing impact on consumption and savings. A deepening deficit should indicate that the Government is reducing total savings, and vice versa.
By this test, expenditures on the pilots' salaries look quite different from cash used to pay off the liabilities of bankrupt banks.
Borrowing to pay Air Force personnel reduces the savings available to build new factories or roads as it increases the purchasing power of individual Government employees. National consumption rises at the expense of savings.
By contrast, money borrowed to close savings banks goes directly into the pockets of depositors. And as Robert Litan, an economist at the Brookings Institution, points out, they are unlikely to spend the cash. National savings does not change, nor does private borrowers' access to capital.
There is no reason, then, to record the transaction in a way that increases the budget deficit. Indeed, counting it against the deficit would wrongly imply that fiscal policy had shifted to a more expansionary stance; in fact, the transaction was a fiscal wash.
By the same token, the interest paid in the future to the holders of the Treasury bonds sold to cover the bailout cost should count as part of future deficits. That income, after all, represents additional purchasing power for everyone from Palm Beach coupon-clippers to Tokyo pensioners; a good chunk of it will be spent on private consumption, draining resources away from investment.
But future claims against the Treasury are not the same as current deficits. And as long as the object of Gramm-Rudman is to discipline the Government's budget today, this future obligation implicit in current borrowing is irrelevant.
Applying parallel logic to Social Security, however, yields less welcome conclusions. Social Security taxes reduce private purchasing power, while Social Security payments raise it. Thus the current and rapidly growing surpluses of the Social Security system represent a fiscal drag on the economy and should rightly remain in any Gramm-Rudman-style measure of the Government's impact on consumption and savings.
The result, many analysts fear, is that Social Security surpluses, programmed to reach about $90 billion annually by the year 2000, will sap the political will to check Government spending on current consumption. Future generations will thus have to tighten their belts to finance the pensions of the baby boomers.
Ideally, Mr. Reischauer suggests, Washington would cope with this dilemma by using different budget yardsticks to answer different questions about the Government's finances. But in a world in which politicians are as likely to speak frankly about taxes and budget entitlements as they are to confess an enthusiasm for sex and drugs, there seems little hope of negotiating a sensible route through the budget maze.

HEADLINE: Fiat Expands Dealings With Soviets and Poles

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TURIN, Italy, May 28

 BODY:
The Fiat Group, racing ahead of its competitors to set up shop in Eastern Europe, has agreed to work with the Soviet Union to produce 900,000 cars a year there and with Polish auto makers to assemble 270,000 cars a year.
Fiat's plans, which involve investment projects of more than $5 billion, call for larger activities in Eastern Europe than any other Western company, Western analysts say.
''We feel these Eastern European markets are of enormous potential for us,'' said Cesare Romiti, chief executive of the Fiat Group. ''These markets will be opening up to consumer goods.'' 
 
Strategy Outlined
Mr. Romiti, who spoke at a news conference today on condition that the information not be published until Wednesday, said that Fiat would expand in Eastern Europe through cooperation agreements, joint ventures and direct investments.
He outlined a strategy in which Fiat, Italy's largest industrial group, would concentrate on expanding not only in Eastern Europe, but also in several Mediterranean countries, notably Spain, Portugal and Turkey.
At the news conference, officials of Fiat - which assembles Alfa Romeo, Lancia, Ferrari and Autobianchi cars as well as Fiats - said that to compete more effectively against the Japanese, Fiat would greatly expand its car range and would offer more leisure vehicles to follow consumer trends that started in the United States.
Fiat, which was in a dead heat with Volkswagen A.G. last year to be No. 1 in market share in Western Europe, had net income of $2.89 billion in 1989 on revenues of about $41 billion.
 
Plans in Soviet Union
Fiat plans to focus its Soviet activities in Yelabuga, 600 miles southeast of Moscow, where it would build three or more plants.
The Soviets have agreed to manufacture, under Fiat license, 300,000 cars a year that would be based on Fiat's Panda subcompact design.
Fiat has also agreed to take a 35 percent stake in a joint venture with the Soviets, who would build about 300,000 Fiat Uno models a year. It would cost Fiat and the Soviet Union $1.5 billion to build that plant. Fiat, which sold 2.3 million cars last year, would be repaid by receiving about 100,000 Uno cars a year to sell in other countries.
In addition, Fiat is negotiating with Soviet officials to build another plant in Yelabuga to assemble 300,000 cars a year. The plant would produce a larger car, in the range of Fiat's compact Tipo model. Fiat also hopes to work with the Soviet Union to produce 900,000 engines, transmissions and gear boxes a year.
All the cars produced would have a joint Soviet and Fiat nameplate, making Fiat the first Western brand name to be allowed on cars sold in the Soviet Union.
Fiat officials hope that Eastern Europe's low wage costs and the economies of scale made possible by the large production will enable the company to sell Eastern-made cars profitably in the West.
''We regard the Eastern European countries both as a market and as a production source,'' Mr. Romiti said.
 
Agreements in Poland
On another front, Fiat, which already works with FSM, one of Poland's auto makers, has a new agreement with FSM to assemble 250,000 cars a year in Bielsko-Biala in southern Poland. That car would be based on a small and inexpensive new model, the Micro. Although most of the Micros would be sold in Poland, Fiat would receive tens of thousands of Micros to sell elsewhere as compensation for its involvement.
After a heated competition, Polish officials chose Fiat over Japan's Daihatsu Motor Company to work with Poland's FSO auto maker to build 20,000 cars a year. Fiat officials said the cars, Tipos, would be built in the Warsaw area.
 
Other Points by Fiat Chief
In his news conference, the first he has held with foreign journalists, Mr. Romiti made several other points:
* He predicted that Fiat's profits would continue to grow, or at least remain steady, despite growing Japanese competition. He said, however, that if demand for cars in Western Europe slipped from its record level of 13 million, the profits of all car makers, including Fiat, would fall, although Fiat would remain one of the most profitable.
* With the auto industry consolidating, he said Fiat would likely step up its cooperation with France's Peugeot group, with which it has a joint venture to build small commercial vehicles. Mr. Romiti said, ''An increase in this relationship would be very productive to both Peugeot and ourselves.''
* He called for a five-year transition period to phase out quotas on Japanese cars, as European Community nations open up their markets. Italy, France, Spain, Portugal and Britain all have quotas on Japanese cars. As the community removes trade barriers, Japan and free-trade-minded officials are pressing to remove all quotas immediately, but some Western Europeans have called for a transition period of up to 10 years.
Promising to improve both worker skills and production processes to compete against the Japanese, he said, ''We at Fiat have a philosophy to build at Japanese costs and quality, but not to become like the Japanese'' in terms of quality of life.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
U.S. Securities Advance in Price

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities moved higher in light trading yesterday, as a rebound in the dollar against the Japanese yen and a drop in commodity prices gave investors reasons to buy notes and bonds.
The recovery of the dollar against the yen on European and American financial markets came after it had fallen in overnight trading in Asia. That selloff pushed Treasury prices lower in Tokyo.
''We have staged a decent recovery from the selloff on Friday, and the market is now in pretty good technical shape,'' one government bond trader said. 
For the next few weeks the supply of new Treasury issues will be confined to auctions of bills and cash management notes. The lack of any new longer-dated issues should help restrain any strong rise in interest rates.
''The market hasn't staged the next leg of its rally, but it seems like it wants to,'' the bond trader said. ''Everybody is looking for the employment data on Friday as an opportunity to do that.''
The Treasury's short-term financings began yesterday, with the weekly auction of three-month and six-month bills. And today $12 billion worth of 20-day and 111-day cash management bills will be sold.
Proceeds from the cash management bill sale will be used by the Treasury to finance the Resolution Trust Corporation's working capital program.
At the bill auction, three-month bills were sold at an average discount rate of 7.80 percent, up from an average rate of 7.74 percent at last week's sale.
Meanwhile, bids on the new six-month bills produced an average discount rate of 7.74 percent, down slightly from the average 7.79 percent rate a week ago.
Following the auction, the Treasury said that it would raise the size of the bill auctions to $17.2 billion effective on Monday from the $16.8 billion that were sold yesterday.
In addition to the dollar's rebound, a drop in commodity prices as measured by the Commodity Research Bureau's index, also provided support to the credit markets.
By late in the day, the Treasury's 8 3/4 percent bonds of 2020 were offered at a price of 101 15/32, up 18/32, to yield 8.61 percent. The benchmark issue was offered at a price to yield 8.66 percent late Friday.
''The bond seems to be very comfortable trading in a fairly narrow range,'' right around 8 5/8 percent, said Joe Liro, a vice president and money market economist at S.G. Warburg Securities Inc. ''And there is not much that is likely to shake it out of that range until Friday.''
 
Ten-Year Note Issues
Among note issues, the 8 7/8 percent 10-year notes were offered at 101 21/ 32 late yesterday, up 3/8 point, to yield 8.62 percent. And the 8 1/2 percent five-year notes auctioned last Wednesday were offered at 99 23/32, up 5/32, to yield 8.55 percent.
In the tax-exempt municipal bond market, the Texas Turnpike Authority offered $131 million worth of bonds through a syndicate led by Dillon, Read & Company.
The issue consists of uninsured serial bonds and two-term bonds that are insured by Ambac Inc.
The 7 1/8 percent term bonds that mature in 2015 were offered on a preliminary basis at a price to yield 7.37 percent. And the 6 percent term bonds due in 2020 were offered at a price to yield 7.25 percent.
Yields on the uninsured serial bonds range from 6.60 percent in 1995 to 7.25 percent on securities that mature in 2005.
The uninsured bonds are rated A by Moody's Investors Services and A-minus by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
The insured bonds are rated triple-A by both Moody's and Standard & Poor's.
Activity in the secondary markets for both tax-exempt and investment-grade corporate bonds was extremely light, dealers said.
Prices of widely quoted investment-grade corporate bonds were unchanged to up 1/8 point. Participants in the municipal bond market said that prices of most issues were unchanged.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills:

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Gains Against Yen But Falls in Other Trading

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Renewed domestic buying after the Memorial Day holiday helped the dollar stage a partial recovery after an earlier selloff abroad. The currency ended higher against the yen yesterday but closed lower against other major currencies.
Gold prices ended lower in the United States. 
Foreign exchange dealers said trading in the dollar was uneventful and interest would probably not perk up before the release of the unemployment data for May, which are due Friday.
Speculation about possible developments at the summit meeting that begins Thursday between President Bush and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union kept some currency dealers on the sidelines.
''It was generally a quiet day today with the dollar climbing back from its overnight selloff,'' said Marc Chandler, a currency analyst at MMS International in Chicago. ''United States dealers took advantage of the dip in the dollar to re-establish long positions.''
The dollar weakened in European trading. Markets in the United States and Britain were closed Monday for a holiday.
''I think the market's taking stock after the holidays,'' said Andrew Elliott, international foreign exchange salesman at Chase Manhattan Bank in London.
In New York, the dollar rose to 151.22 yen, from 149.40 yen late Friday. Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar closed at 150.70 Japanese yen, up from 149.45 yen late Monday. In London, it rose to 150.95 yen.
Against the West German currency, the dollar ended at 1.6740, down from 1.68235.
Selected late dollar rates in New York, compared with Friday's late quotes, included: 1.4105 Swiss francs, down from 1.4235; 5.6380 French francs, down from 5.6615; 1,229.50 Italian lire, down from 1,235.50, and 1.17945 Canadian dollar, down from 1.1830.
The United States dollar weakened against the British pound. Sterling strengthened to $1.6945 in New York from late Friday's $1.6905. In London, the pound rose to $1.6953 from Friday's $1.6930.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with Monday's late levels, included: 1.6710 West German marks, down from 1.6790; 1.4080 Swiss francs, down from 1.4215; 5.6280 French francs, down from 5.6565; 1.8810 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8910; 1,228.25 Italian lire, down from 1,233.50, and 1.1815 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1828.
Gold prices ended with minor losses in domestic trading after posting scattered gains overseas.
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, a troy ounce of gold for current delivery fell 80 cents to close at $367.40.

HEADLINE: SUMMIT IN WASHINGTON;
BESIEGED AT HOME, GORBACHEV ARRIVES IN U.S. FOR SUMMIT

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 30

 BODY:
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union arrived in Washington tonight for his third visit to the United States and his second summit conference with President Bush, as American officials searched for formulas to persuade him to accept Western plans for a unified Germany and a restructured Europe.
The Soviet leader landed at Andrews Air Force Base at 6:50 P.M. after a flight from Ottawa, where he had conferred with the Canadian Prime Minister, Brian Mulroney. With Mr. Gorbachev was his wife, Raisa. [Transcript of remarks, page A12.] Mr. Gorbachev is widely perceived in Washington as weakened by a succession of crises at home caused by nationalist tendencies in the Baltic republics and in Armenia, a lack of confidence by the Soviet public in his new economic plan and the election of a political rival, Boris N. Yeltsin, to the presidency of the Russian republic. 
 
Bush Is Called Confident
Mr. Bush, his spokesman said, is full of ''anticipation and confidence'' on the eve of three days of talks, but unwilling to yield on the basic question of full German membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Mr. Gorbachev also took a stern line on the issue, which promises to be the pivotal question of the meeting that is to open at the White House on Thursday morning.
''The West hasn't done much thinking,'' Mr. Gorbachev said in Canada, describing American insistence that a reunified Germany belong to NATO as ''an old record that keeps playing the same note again and again.''
''They try to dictate,'' he added, ''and this will not suit us.''
 
Canadian Honors Soviet View
Prime Minister Mulroney, noting that the Soviet Union had suffered grievously at the hands of Germany during World War II, gave broad backing to the American approach but asserted, rather surprisingly, that an ''inadvertent insensitivity to the feelings of the Soviet Union'' had crept into allied thinking. He urged Western nations to seek ways to be more ''accommodating'' to Soviet misgivings about Germany.
This evening, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, greeting Mr. Gorbachev in a low-key arrival ceremony, said the United States and the Soviet Union had the responsibility to ''leave behind not only the cold war but the conflicts that preceded it.''
Mr. Gorbachev, in reply, said that ''a lot will depend on our results'' in a meeting that he said was important ''for the promise it holds as the first major step to reduce strategic nuclear arms.''
Mr. Gorbachev looked tanned but tired as he stepped from his jet. About 150 Soviet diplomats and their families, some of them waving red flags, applauded. About 500 Americans, all servicemen and their families based at Andrews, were also on hand. There were neither bands nor a full military honor guard.
Eduard A. Shevardnadze, the Soviet Foreign Minister, was in the Soviet leader's party, as was Anatoly F. Dobrynin, the leading Kremlin expert on the United States, who served as ambassador here for more than two decades.
A 40-car motorcade took the party from the air base, in suburban Maryland, to the Soviet Embassy in downtown Washington where Mr. and Mr. Gorbachev will be staying. Mr. Baker rode with the Soviet leader, then joined him and other Soviet officials for tea.
 
Issues on the Agenda
During their sessions here and at Camp David, the Presidential retreat in the Catoctin Mountains of western Maryland, Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev are expected to approve the outline of a strategic arms agreement and a chemical weapons treaty. Second-echelon negotiators, who have been working on outstanding issues for the last few days, reported progress this afternoon on several contentious points. These included what controls to place on the Soviet Backfire bomber as part of an agreement covering strategic arms.
But major questions remain on Germany and on trade, questions that only Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev will be able to resolve, if anyone can.
Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said that the possibility of according privileged trade status to the Soviet Union had not been ruled out, although Mr. Bush had indicated as much last Thursday. The Administration has been holding back on this in the hope that the Soviet Union will enact new, more liberal emigration legislation, and resolution of the crisis in Lithuania, where Mr. Gorbachev has imposed economic sanctions in the wake of the republic's declaration of independence.
''I intentionally want to be vague'' on trade, Mr. Fitzwater said. ''I urge you not to rule out anything.''
The spokesman denied published reports that the United States was preparing to offer the Soviets a concession on German troop levels in return for Soviet approval of German membership in NATO, a curb on the size of the army of a united Germany in an effort to calm Soviet fears and, in effect, a limit on German sovereignty.
But in fact, senior officials said, the search is on for some means of doing something approaching that without seeming to single out the Germans for special, punitive limits. ''We have spent hours thinking up one kind of sugar after another to coat the NATO membership pill, trying to get the Soviets to swallow it,'' an American planner said.
Washington was in an anticipatory mood for the summit meeting, though some of the novelty that attended the Soviet leader's visit in December 1987 has worn off.
There is worry among some of the experts that President Bush ''has invested too much in his relationship with Gorbachev,'' as Dimitri Simes of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace said today.
There is also a dawning realization, in the phrase of Madeline K. Albright, a specialist on Central Europe who heads the Center for National Policy, that this is the first ''post-Copernican summit'' - the first one at which America is not guaranteed a position around which all the allied planets revolve.
 
A Celebrity Roster
Still, invitations to the state dinner at the White House on Thursday night, with entertainment by the mezzo soprano Frederica von Stade, were avidly coveted. Names like Eisenhower, Roosevelt, Cronkite, Kennedy, Fulbright and Schlesinger were said to be on the list.
Gorbachev pictures appeared in several shop windows along Connecticut Avenue, and permits have been issued to thousands who plan demonstrations in Lafayette Park, across Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House.
President Bush spent a second day preparing for the summit conference, meeting with senior advisers in the morning and afternoon and speaking by telephone with Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany.
''The constraints that have structured and defined the relationship for 45 years are evaporating,'' a ranking Administration official said. ''The issues that President Bush and President Gorbachev will discuss lie at the very root of the U.S.-Soviet conflict: ending the division of Germany, the course of change in the Soviet Union itself, the aspiration of the Baltic peoples, significant reductions in the military threat to the West and the U.S.''
''This is a serious summit about serious issues, the official said.''

HEADLINE: EVOLUTION IN EUROPE;
YELTSIN TAKES AIM AT CENTRAL RULE

BYLINE: By CELESTINE BOHLEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, May 30

 BODY:
In his first day as President of the Russian republic, Boris N. Yeltsin put the Kremlin on notice today with an aggressive program to free Russia from ''the dictates of the center.''
Mr. Yeltsin said he expected the Russian Parliament to pass a declaration of sovereignty for the Russian republic before President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union returned from the United States next week.
''This pyramid must be turned upside down,'' Mr. Yeltsin said, using the occasion of a news conference in the Grand Kremlin Palace to describe his proposal to thwart the nation's strong centralist traditions and to turn power over to the local and republic levels.
The head of the giant Russian republic, the largest and most populous of the 15 in the Soviet Union, the maverick politician poses a formidable challenge to Mr. Gorbachev. Mr. Yeltsin also said at a news conference that the latest plan for economic change presented by by Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov was doomed. 
''I think once you have failed with a program, a government should resign and then a new government should present a new program,'' he said. He predicted that the new economic plan, presented last week, will be defeated in the congress of Russian members of parliament.
Mr. Yeltsin promised to use his first 100 days to put in a place a program for economic autonomy that would allow Russia to contract freely with other Soviet republics for the sale of oil, gas and other natural resources at world prices.
Mr. Yeltsin said his formula for greater independence for the Russian republic would not weaken but rather reinforce the Soviet Union as a federation of autonomous republics. ''The more independent the constituent republics will be, the stronger our union,'' he said.
 
'There Is Work to Do'
''There is work to do,'' he said. ''We should reject the previous forms of government that stipulated that everything be done to build up a powerful center.''
The Russian republic, which stretches 5,500 miles from the border of the republic of Byelorussia to the shores of the Pacific, accounts for 90 percent of the oil output of the Soviet Union and 70 percent of its natural gas. It is home to 147 million people, a little more than half the Soviet population.
In calling for a change in the Soviet power structure, Mr. Yeltsin is challenging the essence of a system built by the Communist Party since the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution. Traditionally, all economic and political decisions have been dictated from the top, with ultimate authority vested in the high echelons of the Communist Party in Moscow. The republics, despite their rights under the Soviet Constitution, were treated as obedient servants.
In the last few years, Mr. Gorbachev has tried to decentralize some of Moscow's dictatorial powers by encouraging factories and farms to negotiate contracts for the purchase and sale of products. Last winter, he also belatedly backed a popular movement that stripped the Communist Party of its constitutional claim to a monopoly of power.
 
Seeks to Decentralize
Elections in recent months at the republic level have produced independent-minded majorities from the Baltics to the Caucasus. In Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia, newly elected Parliaments have called for independence from the Soviet Union, although the three Baltic republics differ on how to achieve secession.
In Russia, the move has not been toward an outright break with the Soviet Union but toward greater sovereignty - a vague concept endorsed last week by an overwhelming majority of the 1,060 deputies to the Russian Parliament, including both Liberal Democrats and more orthodox members of the Communist Party.
Mr. Yeltsin today spelled out a program of radical decentralization under which, he said, ''the lowest government unit closest to the people in villages or towns, delegates power to the next highest level, then to the republic parliament, then to the national parliament, not what we had before when the national level decided and told oil producers how to work and what to pay.''
Mr. Gorbachev has also called for a renegotiation of the contract that binds the republic in the Soviet Union, but his proposal, introduced recently as a draft law before the Soviet Legislature, offers a less abrupt transition than the one outlined by Mr. Yeltsin.
Mr. Yeltsin said one of the first tasks of the newly sovereign Russian republic would be to adopt ''its own interpretation on the law on land, our Russian law on property and the independence of enterprises.''
 
Local Pricing
Sale prices for the republic's resources would be set at the republic level, he said. He noted that the internal prices for oil and gas within the Soviet Union were now one-fifth of world prices. ''Gradually we will be passing from negotiated prices, to world prices,'' he said. ''I do think a hundred days is enough for this.''
The central authorities will continue to control such national functions as the military, state security, strategic economic planning and resolution of ''issues and tensions'' arising between the constituent republics, Mr. Yeltsin said today.
''Of course, there would be sufficient powers within the center,'' he said. ''But in comparison with the current situation, those powers would be considerably diminished in favor of the constituent republics.''
For instance, he said, republic law would take precedence over Soviet law, and the President of the Soviet Union would not have any greater authorities than the presidents of the republic. ''There will be no big, no small presidents,'' he said. ''They would be equal.''
 
Wants a Russian Presidency
In the Russian republic, where his full title is Chairman of the Supreme Soviet, Mr. Yeltsin today proposed instituting the post of president and holding direct election in a year.
Many of the details of Mr. Yeltsin's programs are still unclear, including how prices would be controlled from republic to republic, and how conflicts between the lcoal and the central authorities would be resolved.
Mr. Yeltsin again criticized the Soviet Government's economic plan, in particular the proposal to drastically increase food prices, which he said puts an unfair burden on the population.
But he repeatedly dodged questions on how he would shift the Soviet economy toward a market system. ''We must find another transition to the market economy that does not lead to a deterioration in the standard of living,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Fear in the Bargaining;
Specters of the Past Are the Chips of Today As Gorbachev Deals on Germany's Status

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 30

 BODY:
When Soviet analysts anticipate the Soviet-American talks this week on the future of Europe, they sometimes draw an ominous analogy between President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's Soviet Union and Germany after World War I. Once again, they say, a great power's ambitions for world influence lie in tatters. Again, a failed economy has caused panic and pessimism. Again, a surly nationalism is on the rise. Again, rival powers are tempted to press their advantage.
The message is not subtle: if the West insists on a new European order that humiliates the Soviet Union, including a reunited Germany incorporated into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's military structure, the consequence could be a bitter Russia, comparable to the bitter Germany that gave birth to Hitler. 
 
'Explosive Mixture'
''You have the same explosive mixture you had in Germany in the 1930's,'' said Andrei S. Grachov, an official in the international department of the Communist Party Central Committee who is in Washington as part of Mr. Gorbachev's advance team. ''The humiliation of a great power. Economic troubles. The rise of nationalism. You should not underestimate the danger.''
The menace of a militant Russian nationalism rising to challenge Mr. Gorbachev is played for effect; bargaining from weakness, some Soviet officials are trying to turn their very weakness into a bargaining point.
But American officials generally agree that for Mr. Gorbachev this summit meeting is as much about perceptions and psychology as it is about troops and alliances. They see the challenge of this week as shaping something Mr. Gorbachev can take home without seeming vanquished.
 
'Hefty Bit of Reassurance'
''Certainly there is the potential for embitterment if the German settlement is seen as a clear Soviet retreat,'' a State Department official said, saying that Mr. Gorbachev and Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze raised the matter in their recent Moscow meetings with Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d.
''We can't change NATO strategy overnight, and we can't change it just to please the Soviets,'' the official added. ''But one of the main purposes of this summit is to do a hefty bit of reassurance that they need not fear for their security position.''
More than any leader in Soviet history, Mr. Gorbachev is bound to reckon with public opinion in the making of his foreign policy. Although the greater liberty of glasnost has not been fully extended to foreign affairs, Mr. Gorbachev's military cutbacks and the downfall of Communist Governments in Eastern Europe have given rise to explicit hard-line criticism in the press.
Soviet newspapers that cater to Russian nationalists have lately taken the line that the demise of Communism in Eastern Europe amounted to surrendering the gains of World War II.
Some Soviet analysts say the arithmetic of arms control is also beginning to work against Mr. Gorbachev. Already there have been public grumbles about the treaty now taking shape on long-range nuclear weapons, which would leave the Soviet side with 2,000 fewer warheads than the Americans.
Aleksandr Bovin, the influential commentator for the Government daily, Izvestia, asked last week in a column, ''Why are we agreeing to have a strategic arsenal of significantly fewer warheads than the Americans have?''
Mr. Bovin supports the treaty and was clearly trying to pre-empt an attack by raising the issue first.
Sergei Karaganov, a scholar at the Soviet Institute of Europe, insists that the strategic arms treaty, which the two sides hope to sign this year, could even fail to win approval in the Soviet Parliament. Legislators say that is improbable, but confirm that for the first time Mr. Gorbachev will have to submit a treaty to genuine debate.
 
Elusive 'Peace Dividend'
One reason for a new public skepticism about arms control is that Soviet consumers have not yet felt any serious benefit from treaties already signed. Mr. Gorbachev has found that cashing in the ''peace dividend'' promised by arms cuts is more complicated than anyone envisioned. His strained economy cannot easily house and employ the thousands of troops scheduled for demobilization, creating a restive mood among career officers. His plan to convert military industries to production of consumer goods has also been a disappointment.
The strength of the hard-liners is difficult to measure. Russian nationalist candidates have had little success so far in their few electoral campaigns, and opinion polls show that the most xenophobic nationalist groups have a tiny popular following. But Mr. Gorbachev's aides insist it would be a mistake to underestimate the combustible combination of economic misery and political humiliation.
Lately several attempts have been made to form an alliance of Russian nationalists, orthodox Communists and disgruntled blue-collar workers, all of whom share a deep unhappiness with Mr. Gorbachev's Western-oriented economic and political initiatives. And many Russians have been alarmed by the new assertiveness of other Soviet ethnic minorities.
 
The Hitler Analogy
A Soviet official in Mr. Gorbachev's advance team noted today that in the voting for the presidency of the Russian Federation, Boris N. Yeltsin, the Gorbachev rival who was victorious on Tuesday, was very nearly matched in the first two rounds of voting by a hard-liner, Ivan K. Polozkov.
''What is important for me is not that Yeltsin got elected, but that so many voted for Polozkov,'' said this official.
When skeptics question the potency of Russian nationalism, Soviet officials point out that no one anticipated Hitler when, after the World War I, the Allied Powers imposed the humiliating Treaty of Versailles on defeated Germany. The treaty ceded vast tracts of German land to the victors, sharply curtailed the German military and imposed crippling war reparations.
The universal feeling of injustice in Germany led, over the next two decades, to the the rise of Hitler.
A State Department official said: ''It's hard to see the rise of a new leadership able to rally the people to an expansionist policy, a la Hitler. The country is totally bankrupt, and I don't think there is much resonance for that kind of platform.
''But if the Soviet Union is going to become a partner in the new Europe, it's not in anybody's interest to leave them feeling bruised and beaten.''
 
Soviet Position Unclear
The Soviet side is still a bit vague about what exactly it needs from Mr. Bush to allay their fears. Mr. Gorbachev has publicly insisted that a reunited Germany must remain outside the NATO military structure.
Other Soviet officials have hinted broadly that the Kremlin position is more flexible. The main thing Mr. Gorbachev needs, they say, is some indirect limit on German military power, and some evidence that the traditional division of Europe into two blocs is giving way to a more collective security arrangement. Moscow has floated various ideas, like the creation of multinational crisis centers or even a joint East-West peacekeeping force.
Mr. Karaganov and others in official research institutes say Mr. Gorbachev probably could tolerate a united Germany within NATO, if only the psychological impact could be minimized.
''Probably the direct military threat to the Soviet Union would not increase,'' Mr. Karaganov said. ''But the psychological shift would be very significant. And it would create a perception in the Soviet Union very much like that created in Germany after the Versailles Treaty was signed.''

HEADLINE: Wage Gap Between Sexes Is Cut in Test, but at a Price

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: OLYMPIA, Wash.

 BODY:
Four years ago the State of Washington, prodded by its biggest public employee union, struck a celebrated blow for women when it began a program intended to raise the pay for government jobs typically considered women's work.
By setting new pay levels for 62,000 employees - pay levels that sometimes differed sharply from what a private employer would offer - the state accomplished much of what it set out to do: bring the pay of women more in line with men doing comparable work.
 
Serious Worker Shortages
In jobs historically populated by women, many wages have climbed more than twice as much as have those for male-dominated jobs. Officials say they have nearly met their goal of narrowing the gap between the average wages of men and women to 5 percent, from 20 percent. Many women working for the state say they have won new status and respect. 
But as officials have found, solving one problem can create others. For the most part, jobs traditionally held by women are still performed by women and jobs traditionally held by men are performed by men. Private industry is luring away many workers in male-dominated jobs because it now pays them considerably more than the state, leaving serious shortages in some occupational groups.
Washington State provides the nation's biggest test so far of paying women the same as men who have different jobs but jobs seen as equally demanding. The program is up for re-evaluation in 1992, and many top officials say it cannot continue without a major overhaul to close the wage gap between the sexes entirely and to accommodate future changes in the types of jobs.
 
Problems to Be Expected
Proponents of the pay scale they call comparable worth say that problems have to be expected when attempting something so ambitious. ''When you eliminate sex discrimination in the workplace,'' said Claudia Wayne, executive director of the National Committee on Pay Equity, a women's advocacy group, ''there are bound to be ripple effects and adjustments.''
But some labor economists find the program seriously flawed. ''They made a mistake,'' said Mark R. Killingsworth, labor economist at Rutgers University. ''It's like Prohibition. The solution is worse than the disease.''
Many other states have instituted smaller comparable-worth programs or want to do so, and they all look to Washington State for lessons. Because the Washington State program has been under way for four years, the lessons are beginning to emerge with some clarity:
* For many women, the new pay plan has simply reinforced segregation by sex. The typing pool, once a low-paid pink-collar ghetto, is now a better-paid pink-collar ghetto.
* No one has had to take a salary cut, but to pay the $400 million cost of adjustments, the state had to reduce across-the-board cost-of-living increases. And in some traditionally male fields, wages for government workers have fallen 30 percent or more below pay levels for similar jobs in private industry.
* Many men are leaving or rejecting government jobs; their representation in state employment has slipped to 47 percent from 50 percent four years ago.
* Shortages are growing among some workers, both men and women, with special skills like nursing. More and more, to recruit and hold onto these people, the state is granting them special pay increases that violate the guidelines of its program, provoking demands from other workers for similar increases.
State personnel officials say they do not expect to fully analyze the program until it has run its course. But they have found serious flaws in the way the program ignores private industry wages and in how it sets workers' wages.
''It has helped with the disparity problem and made things more equitable,'' said Dee W. Henderson, the state's personnel director, who oversees the state's 45,000 hourly employees in most departments outside the college system. He said he knew of no way to correct the program's anomalies without creating others.
''It's difficult to manage,'' Mr. Henderson said. ''If it's continued, it needs a whole new look.''
Dorothy Gerard, who was formerly the human resources manager for the 17,000 hourly employees of the state's 30 colleges and universities and was recently promoted to a top job in Mr. Henderson's deparment, said, ''I think it's going to be extremely difficult to sustain it without some real revisions.''
The government's largest union, the Washington local of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, which had promoted the plan for 13 years before overcoming state opposition to it, attributes the problems less to the plan than to its implementation. But some of the problems have surprised the union, too. ''It needs a major look,'' said Larry Goodman, a leader in the local.
Plan Is Extension Of Equal Job Pay Like many less costly, less comprehensive variations adopted in recent years by scores of states and municipalities, Washington's program is an extension of the practice of paying identical wages to men and women in the same jobs.
The practice of equal pay for the sexes in the same jobs was mandated by Federal law 1960's. But despite the equal pay laws, the Federal Department of Labor finds that the average pay of women nationwide is about 70 percent that of men's.
There are a number of causes for the disparity: More women than men hold lower-level jobs. Many women interrupt their careers to have children and therefore have less seniority than men. Women suffer because a presumption persists in industry that men are their families' principal wage earners and therefore should be paid more.
Advocates of comparable worth say that all of these causes invite employers to discriminate against women. The advocates want to fight the discrimination by showing that women in the lower-paid jobs perform work that is comparable to that of men in better-paid jobs like laborer and truck driver and that the women should therefore be paid the same as the men.
Jane Riley, a mother of two grown children, and Susan Kneeland, who is single, are custodians who work the 5-P.M.-to-1 A.M. shift cleaning state office buildings in Olympia. They have received some of the biggest raises in the state's program, to about $18,000 currently. ''It seems like more people want to be custodians now because there is a feeling that we're equal,'' Ms. Riley said.
Employers in private industry and many economists counter by saying that the wage gap between men and women has been slowly shrinking anyway. With the help of laws against employer practices that thwart women's access to better-paid jobs, women's average pay has risen to the 70 percent level from a little over 60 percent of men's pay a decade ago.
Program Is Rooted In Rigid Evaluations Washington's program is rooted in a rigid job evaluation process for the two personnel systems, one for higher education and the other for nearly all other government employees below the executive level. Two committees, made up of senior administrators, personnel officials and union representatives, establish the value of a job by awarding points based on the knowledge and skill the job requires, along with its mental demands, its accountability and the working conditions.
Then, the committees try to adjust wages so that job categories that have similar point totals will also have similar salaries.
A secretarial job that includes shorthand duties was awarded 197 points, while a jail guard's position was awarded 190 points. A teacher's aide job, with 176 points, was ranked below the secretarial position, but much higher than a truck driver's job, with 97 points. Of those job classifications, secretaries and teachers' aides were granted large pay increases and the other classifications none.
Some evaluations seem arbitrary. A ''fisheries patrol officer 2,'' usually a man with a year's experience, was allotted 382 points, more than biologists, chemists, geologists, psychologists, registered nurses and civil engineers - all of whom have similar levels of experience but more extensive educational backgrounds.
Officials say that fisheries officers carry guns, and that this raises their responsibility. They add that the officers must work outdoors on the water and that this requirement is considered an especially undesirable working condition.
At the same time, despite the efforts of the evaluation committees to rethink traditional wage levels, the free market keeps intruding, in some cases to the greater benefit of female employees than the new pay program.
Special Raises Given To Recruit Workers Recently the Washington State personnel department granted special pay increases above the comparable worth and regular cost-of-living adjustments for workers in several categories to recruit and retain them in the face of shortages and higher wages paid in private industry. Registered nurses received a 15 percent raise; psychiatrists 12.5 percent and pharmacists 10 percent.
Special raises also went to hundreds of attendants in mental health institutions.
Problems have also arisen over the new pay relationships among various groups and the desire to encourage men to enter jobs held mostly by women.
The largest group of workers overseen by the state personnel department is its 2,880 clerk-typists. In the past, an ambitious top-level ''clerk-typist 3'' who found herself at a career dead end typically sought promotion to the job of fiscal technician - bookkeeping, primarily - where the proportion of women is smaller. That job can then lead to a still bigger promotion to accountant.
With the institution of the comparable worth program, however, clerk-typist 3's have been refusing the promotion. Their wages have leaped 27 percent, from $15,204 a year to $19,332, while fiscal technicians, awarded fewer points by the job evaluators, have received less. To accept the promotion the typist now has to take a pay cut, so many are staying put.
Pay of Some Groups Causes Friction The proportion of women clerk-typist 3's today is 95.6 percent, as against a trifle higher than the 95.5 percent of four years ago.
Robert Sweem, a word processor operator at the Tacoma office of the Department of Social and Health Services, said he and the two women he works with are miffed that clerk-typist 3's received comparable worth adjustments. ''Our pay range didn't change,'' Mr. Sweem said, ''and it takes a lot more to learn word processing than to sit down at a typewriter and just type.''
Many concerns that have arisen in Washington State are being echoed in Ontario, where an even larger comparable-worth program began to take effect last year. It covers private and public employers and 1.7 million women.
In Washington State, men now appear to be looking for well-paid jobs outside the government, rather than trying to vie for relatively well-paid state jobs in which women predominate. ''There's still a stigma to a man being a secretary,'' Mr. Goodman said.
Professor Killingsworth of Rutgers said: ''The issue is whether their comparable-worth system is measuring something meaningful. The basic problem is that awarding points for jobs depends entirely on the eye of the beholder. It tells you nothing of what wages should be without discrimination.''

HEADLINE: 2 CHINA DISSIDENTS DETAINED IN MAY

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, May 30

 BODY:
The Chinese authorities have recently detained at least two democracy advocates, including one who spent a decade in prison for political beliefs, Chinese familiar with the cases say.
Students at Beijing University said a fellow student, Peng Rong, was detained on Friday, one day after President Bush recommended the renewal of most-favored-nation trading status for China.
Two weeks ago, Liu Qing, a leader of the Democracy Wall movement in 1978-79, was picked up and accused of not having a valid permit to live in Beijing, associates said. 
One of the most prominent dissidents in China, Mr. Liu was freed from prison at the end of 1989 after having served 10 years for advocating democracy and human rights and also for publicizing prison conditions.
After his release, Mr. Liu steered clear of overt political activity.
Fellow students said they were not certain why Mr. Peng had been detained or whether he might be released. But they said they suspected the reason was that he signed and put up a poster on May 11 urging an end to foreign economic sanctions against China.
 
Exact Charges Unclear
Although the poster echoed the official position, it is illegal to put up posters or petitions without approval. A year ago, posters at Beijing University helped set off student demonstrations.
University authorities deny that Mr. Peng was detained because of the poster, students said. They attribute the action to ''counterrevolutionary'' activities. Three other students who also signed the May 11 petition have not been arrested so far. But one or more other students were also detained in connection with the incident, two university teachers said.
Mr. Peng took part in the students' demonstrations a year ago, but he was not detained in the months after the army's June 4 suppression of the demonstrations and he was not on the list of 21 students sought after the violence.
No other arrests of students have been reported since 211 political prisoners were released this month, apparently as a gesture to the United States.
Still, the authorities are worried about unrest on the anniversary of the military action or before Beijing plays host to the Asian Games in the fall.

HEADLINE: Liberian Soldiers Reportedly Attack U.N. Center

BYLINE: By KENNETH B. NOBLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MONROVIA, Liberia, May 30

 BODY:
Liberian Government soldiers were reported today to have entered a United Nations compound here and abducted about 40 refugees who had taken shelter there in the face of a continuing advance by rebels toward this nervous capital.
Witnesses said that eight soldiers, some of them wearing masks, entered the compound of the United Nations Development Program early this morning and shot to death a civilian security guard. They then rounded up the refugees, stripped them of their clothes and took them away to a deserted site on the outskirts of the city.
According to several refugees who managed to escape from the abductors, the others were later shot and killed by the soldiers. This afternoon, four unidentified bodies were found near the place where the incident was said to have occurred. 
In all, about 400 refugees had been sleeping at the United Nations compound, most of them people who came from Nimba County in the north where the rebels are said to have drawn the bulk of their support among members of the region's Gio and Mano tribes.
The encampment of refugees grew in the last two weeks. Last Friday, about 200 of the Gio and Mano tribespeople came to the United States Embassy seeking safety and shelter. They were told by officials that there was liitle that could be done for them and they were directed to the United Nations and the International Red Cross.
Speaking of the attackers today, Michael Heyn, the United Nations representative in Monrovia, described the group that stormed the compound: ''From the reports we have, they were army soldiers, dressed in army uniforms, driving army trucks,'' he said. ''The guards tried to prevent them from coming in, they shot one and bayoneted another, and they began shooting indiscriminately. We were told they grabbed people with children in their arms and threw them on the trucks.'' More than 300 people remained at the compound after the assault.
Mr. Heyn added that he was ''completely astounded and unbelieving'' that such an incident could happen and said that it was a serious infringement of international law.
Because of the incident, the United Nations Secretary General announced in New York today that it had ordered the immediate evacuation of all personnel from Liberia. The move is expected to complicate relief efforts because the United Nations remains one of the main agencies providing food, and organizing medical help for the tens of thousands of displaced people who have fled northeastern Liberia since the fighting began five months ago.
Late this afternoon, President Samuel K. Doe went to the compound to talk to diplomats. As he entered the gates, he was confronted by an angry crowd.
''I want you to know that those people who would do this kind of thing, they are doing it on their own,'' the President said, ''and I'm going to deal with them drastically.''
The brief speech was met with scattered hissing, and some of the young men in the crowd taunted the soldiers who were with the President. ''Don't believe him! Don't believe him!'' one of the refugees shouted.
The warfare started when about 250 guerrillas invaded half a dozen hamlets in the northeast region. The Liberian Government sent troops and provincial policemen to oust them.
Since then the rebels, led by Charles Taylor, a former Cabinet member under Mr. Doe, have increased their force by several thousand and have pushed the army virtually out of of Nimba County, Liberia's primary agricultural, mining and logging region. The rebels now sey they have beseiged Buchanan, the port east of Monrovia.
 
Protest by U.N.
UNITED NATIONS, May 30 (Reuters) (Special to The New York Times) - The United Nations has protested to Liberia over the attack by masked troops early today in Monrovia. Eleven foreign staff members still in Monrovia are being evacuated to Dakar, Senegal, a spokesman said.

HEADLINE: SUMMIT IN WASHINGTON;
Soviet Leader's News Conference in Ottawa and His Arrival in Washington

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from a news conference by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union and Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada in Ottawa yesterday, and a transcript of statements by Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and Mr. Gorbachev after the Soviet President's arrival in Washington. All the remarks were recorded through the facilities of the Cable News Network. Mr. Gorbachev spoke through a translator.
 
IN OTTAWA
 
Dealing With Nationalism
 
Q. I'd like to ask, Mr. President, if you expressed, or you have any feelings of sympathy for Prime Minister Mulroney, with facing somewhat similar problems to yours in his own country. I mean accommodating rising nationalism. And maybe I could ask both of you, particularly President Gorbachev, but maybe Prime Minister Mulroney at the same time - how do you feel - how difficult is it for you to accommodate rising nationalism within your own federations? 
 
A. Indeed, this problem does exist, and on a philosophical and political plane, was analyzed by us. And of course democratic processes are at the base of these developments and these changes - of course give an impetus to a feeling of national pride and the national question as such. Moreover, there are quite a few problems in these relations. This is a fact. And we, in general, from this point of view, we find that it is a positive development where you talk about the rebirth of national honor, about culture, preservation of national identity. I think this is a progressive movement, and this, of course, should be reflected in modern politics. Undoubtedly this is so.
But in connection with that, and perhaps because of that, or in spite of that, certain developments take place which are often negative in nature, because where there are elements of nationalism, and then it changes into some sort of super nationalism, and then it leads to separatism, this is what cannot but worry us.
Still, I do believe, and I'm convinced, and our experience has shown that if we are not too late in our policy, and we can catch these impulses, and adequately reflect them in our structures, forms - how to realize this national spirit and what is connected with the rebirth of nationalism - I think with time this will be channeled into cultural, political channels - lead to harmonization of relations.
I see no other thesis or approach which can replace what we are doing now - what we insist upon. We have to live together in good cooperation, but mainly so that a human being, no matter of what nationality, in any place of the country, and that's how it should be in the whole world, have the same rights, no matter where he be, and be protected by constitution, by the laws. There can be no other approach, because where there are limitations, discrimination, immigrants - because there immediately a negative situation arises that assumes a political, social, coloration. We view the question of possible developments of national relations in our country, and we need revolutionary, fundamental, changes. Republics must have economic independence, their identity and broadest possible possibility to develop their culture, language, to preserve their traditions. That's how we are going to act.
 
The Germans and NATO
 
Q. German membership in NATO - Were you able to bring your points of view closer together just a little bit or not? Thank you.
 
A. . . . You know, we have a general understanding that everything that pertains to internal affairs, pertaining to Germany, this is up to the Germans. Now we understand it and we will pay attention to it although the Germans will have the problem too. They have to get rid of euphoria and to get down to business because they've got enough problems.
But let the Germans resolve it. If they ask us for advice, yes we'll give it because our interests are kind of intertwined in the internal sphere but our topic as we discussed, we discussed the external issues connected with the unification of Germany. I must say that we discussed it thoroughly, very thoroughly. Personally I think that there are certain reserves available to find ways to bring our points of view closer together, a possible way of doing it that will not look like what the West is proposing because the West hasn't done any thinking, much thinking. They tried to dictate and this will not suit us. Now, as for the Soviet Union, we had one proposal, now we have two or three. I presented them in Moscow and some other approaches that deserve attention to be worked on.
However, let me stress the main thought and I ask the journalists to look at that. We are living a new Europe, changing Europe, changing for the best. As a result of these changes, instead of confrontation and divergence we are getting closer together. We get to know each other better. We even begin to trust each other and can make very important decisions. . . . I think the main thing is about the future from the sole point of view about Germany, it must be a version which will help these positive processes that will strengthen and not the other way which will undermine this process, and our hopes are with it.
If you have some hopes, I will disappoint you that the Soviet Union is so busy with perestroika it can - you can fish in muddy waters. No, this will not - this is a very superficial analysis. You cannot ignore philosophy and by doing so you ignore politics. You have to think in some sort of way, big way. . . . There's a process of deep changes which will create a new world situation, a new nature in our relationship. Oh, there will be some difficulties, some moments will arise, do not deviate from your main course.
 
MULRONEY: All of the nations suffered greatly in the Second World War, but none - none suffered more dramatically than the Soviet Union. I believe that the velocity of change, the unpredictable velocity of change in Western Europe in respect of the unification of the Germanys has resulted in a degree of insensitivity -inadvertent insensitivity - to the feelings, the legitimate security apprehensions of the Soviet Union.
One of the most important developments since the war, if not the most, has been the successful dialogue initiated by President Gorbachev and President Reagan, now President Bush. This is a most important and a singularly constructive forum for the world. It is important that the ongoing success of this not be predicated necessarily, or exclusively, on a litmus-test proposal that involved the manner in which the question of Germany were ultimately resolved.
Once under way, democracy is an uncontrollable event, and that's what happened in Eastern Europe. That having been said, Mr. Clark and Mr. Shevardnadze have discussed since ''open skies'' here in Ottawa matters, opportunities for reorientation, as well, of NATO thinking based on Article 2 of the charter, which would be more amenable to the new situation that exists now in the Soviet Union and in Central Europe.
Also the role for the C.S.C.E. The institutionalized apparatus, and its future, would, I think - if better defined, if more properly explained, if better negotiated - could give a great deal of comfort to those in the Soviet Union who bear the scars and the very sad memories of something which for many of us far away in the United States and Canada was a war we fought vigorously, and I think well, but without the lasting burdens in one's homeland.
This is something most important for Americans and Canadians to remember.
Mr. Clark and I have sought, and will continue to seek, at the NATO summit in early July and then at the Houston summit of the G-7, every opportunity to convey this to our colleagues so that the important instrument of the Soviet-U.S. summits not be impaired by tandem or parallel action which is going on in respect of the unification of Germany and its place in NATO.
Canada feels very strongly about the value of NATO and about the importance of accepting membership by a unified Germany. But there are ways and there's a manner in which this might be done that would be more accommodating of the realities that President Gorbachev has spoken of so eloquently and so well. And I know that Canada has been communicating with its partners and will continue to do so to make sure that reasonable goals are achieved without impairing or perhaps dealing a lethal blow to the progress that President Gorbachev and President Bush have initiated thus far.
 
IN WASHINGTON
 
BAKER: Mr. President, Mrs. Gorbachev, I'm delighted to welcome you to Washington on behalf of the President and Mrs. Bush, and on behalf, as well, of the American people.
Mr. President, the eyes of the world are on you, and they are on President Bush. Together our nations have the responsibility to leave behind not only the cold war but also the conflicts that preceded it.
To do that we must see a Germany unified and Europe reconciled. We must reduce the danger of war by controlling nuclear, chemical and conventional arms and by resolving regional conflicts and of course we want to see continued movement toward democracy and openness in the Soviet Union.
Mr. President, the world has looked forward since last winter to this visit, and to the promise that this visit holds. So together this week, let us seek to fulfill that promise.
 
Summit's Potential
 
GORBACHEV: Thank you, Mr. Secretary of State, for your words of welcome and hospitality.
In these first minutes of our visit to America, I wish to convey on behalf of the peoples of the U.S.S.R., our best wishes to the people of the United States.
While looking forward to important talks with President George Bush, a lot will depend on their results in determining how things will work out, not only between you Americans and us, but also on a larger scale.
We shall also have meetings with other political leaders, public figures and, I hope, with other Americans of various positions and walks of life.
This summit stands out in its importance first of all for the promise it holds of the first major step to reduce strategic nuclear arms. Both sides have worked painstakingly together to prepare it.
This meeting is also special because this is the first time that the President of the United States and I will have enough time to reflect on and discuss not only in a formal setting but also in more informal surroundings, one on one, all questions either of us might have that fall within our responsibility.
I would like once again to wish peace and well being to every American home. Thank you.

HEADLINE: EVOLUTION IN EUROPE;
Gorbachev Plans to Meet South Korean, U.S. Says

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 30

 BODY:
In a major step toward improving relations with South Korea, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has agreed to meet with President Roh Tae Woo of South Korea during his visit to the United States, Administration officials said today.
Mr. Gorbachev will meet with Mr. Roh in San Francisco on Sunday or Monday, after the Soviet President's summit meeting here with President Bush, officials said. Mr. Roh is then expected to travel to Washington to meet with Mr. Bush, they said.
Although there have been informal talks between influential Koreans and Soviet figures in recent years, the planned meeting in San Francisco would be the first contact between leaders of the two countries, which have been ideological and military adversaries for more than 40 years.
The talks appear to be a diplomatic slap at the North Korean leader, Kim Il Sung. The meeting will come at a time when the Soviet press has been criticizing Mr. Kim's leadership with a new openness, while taking slow but steady steps toward establishing full diplomatic relations with South Korea. 
 
North Korean Opinion
The North Korean Government, increasingly isolated by the decay of Communism and the improving relations between South Korea and Moscow, has been inveighing against the establishment of diplomatic relations between those two countries.
Underscoring this tension, Nikolai V. Shishlin, a spokesman for the Soviet Communist Party Central Committee, shrugged off the possibility of a bad North Korean reaction to the planned meeting between Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Roh.
''We must have our own policy, not the policy of the 'great leader,' '' Mr. Shishlin said, using evident sarcasm with a title often used for Mr. Kim in North Korea.
Officially, the State Department and the White House declined to say whether Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Roh would meet in San Francisco. But Administration officials said the South Korean Government had informed Washington about the planned visit.
 
Administration Is Pleased
Although the Administration has no control over Mr. Gorbachev's schedule after he leaves Washington, it has been encouraging the Soviet Union to improve ties with South Korea and officials were clearly pleased by the Soviet leader's decision to meet with Mr. Roh in the United States.
In the last year, South Korea and the Soviet Union have been slowly moving toward better relations, exchanging trade missions and more recently consular representatives, and steadily increasing their commerce.
Although they still do not have embassies in each others' capitals, South Korea's consular representative in Moscow has ambassadorial rank and Mr. Gorbachev has said that he sees no obstacles to establishing full diplomatic relations.
Mr. Shishlin said today in Washington that news of the planned meeting between Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Roh suggested that ''we are on the way to restoring our diplomatic relations.''
 
'A Much Faster Pace'
Selig S. Harrison, a specialist on Korean affairs with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said: ''The question of Soviet diplomatic normalization with South Korea has been boiling rather hard in recent months. The question has been, will the Russians move to full normalization quickly or attempt to sustain a long interim period in which they might get the economic benefits of more trade without full diplomatic relations?''
''This meeting suggests a much faster pace,'' Mr. Harrison said.
Ralph N. Clough of the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University said the planned meeting was a serious blow to North Korea, which relies on the Soviet Union not only for military supplies and political support but as an ally in its slow-going discussions on improving relations with South Korea.
''What this shows is that increasingly, the Soviets are finding South Korea much more important to them than North Korea,'' he said, ''particularly -they hope - in economic terms.''
 
Recent Signs of Friction
In trying to explain Mr. Gorbachev's decision to make a gesture that seemed certain to anger North Korea, specialists on Korean affairs pointed to recent signs of friction in Soviet-North Korean relations.
The Soviet Union has been embarrassed by North Korea's continuing refusal to admit international inspectors to its nuclear power plants in accordance with the treaty limiting the spread of nuclear weapons, which Moscow pressed the North Koreans to sign.
North Korea expelled a correspondent of the official Soviet press agency Tass recently for his articles on North Korea's economic problems. And where the Soviet press once faithfully parroted the adulation accorded Mr. Kim in Pyongyang, it now laces it reports with sarcastic references.
The journal Argumenty i Fakty, a leading Soviet publication, recently accused Mr. Kim, for example, of turning his country into a museum ''devoted to his own self-glorification and self-aggrandizement.''
 
Seen as a Hopeful Sign
Soviet historians have said recently for the first time that North Korea started the war with South Korea and have called into question one of the most sacred stories of Mr. Kim's past - that he was single-handedly responsible for liberating the Korean peninsula from Japanese occupation.
The Bush Administration has taken all of this as a hopeful sign that the Soviet Union would normalize ties with South Korea without waiting for the United States to establish diplomatic relations with North Korea.
The United States and North Korea have been conducting quiet discussions between the political counselors at their embassies in Beijing for 18 months, but they have not produced substantial progress.

HEADLINE: New Mexico Split Over Where Sheep May Graze

BYLINE: By KATHLEEN TELTSCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS OJOS, N.M.

 BODY:
It could be a Hollywood script. A group of sheep ranchers, scratching out a livelihood in New Mexico's scenic but dirt-poor Chama Valley, want their flocks to graze on government lands. But state and Federal agencies, joined by an uncommon alliance of hunting and environmental groups, oppose the grazing as a threat to the land and the wildlife.
Build to a confrontation with armed forest rangers threatening to truck away hundreds of the sheep. Include a cameo role for Robert Redford as the ranchers' sympathetic ally. 
The scenario is being played out at Ganados del Valle, a ranching and weaving cooperative of 50 families whose Hispanic forebears settled 300 years ago in northern Rio Arriba County, about 100 miles north of Santa Fe.
 
Parallel With Other Lands
The clash of interests is bigger than what is happening in Los Ojos, says Margaret Clark of the Ford Foundation, which has given Ganados $127,000 since 1986.
''This is today's hot issue - the challenge to environmentalists to fold the needs of local people with limited resources into plans for using public lands,'' said Ms. Clark. ''It is happening in the Amazonian rain forests where local rubber tappers are threatened. It is happening in Indonesia with small-scale farmers.''
The State Game Commission and the ranchers disagree over whether the sheep would be competing for forage with more than 100 species of wildlife, including elk that are part of the lure of New Mexico's $350-million-a-year hunting and fishing economy.
Some members of the Ganados cooperative say the refusal of grazing opportunities smacks of discrimination against the Hispanic farmers. Opponents complain that the ranchers want special favors and are using a sophisticated campaign of political pressure to get them.
 
A Role for Redford
Inevitably, the Ganados story is compared to the plot of the ''Milagro Beanfield War,'' a story of disputed land and water rights filmed by Mr. Redford in another part of New Mexico five years ago. Proceeds from its premiere in Santa Fe went to Ganados, which in turn created a fund to help other struggling communities, whether or not they raise sheep.
The Ganados ranchers have already scored economic successes in Los Ojos, one of the nation's poorest rural communities. Annual per capita income is about $8,500 as against $16,491 elsewhere in the United States and $12,469 in all of New Mexico.
Together, the families established Tierra Wools, a hand weaving and spinning business that turns out rugs, tapestries and outer garments in traditional Rio Grande patterns.
 
Rescue of a Sheep Breed
The ranchers, whose reputation has spread as far as Australia and New Zealand, have rehabilitated a near-extinct Churro sheep whose long fleece is prized by weavers. Two years ago, they began marketing Pastores lamb, produced without chemicals, for restaurants in Santa Fe and Taos.
In July, Ganados will open a general store that will sell feed and provide a showcase for handicrafts and delicacies, encouraging enterprises too small to survive unassisted.
But Ganados's future is now clouded by the dispute over the grazing lands.
Forage on land owned by the families is running out, and the sheep will soon have to be turned out on summer pasture, says Antonio Manzanares, a co-founder of the cooperative.
The sheep owners have been unable to buy or lease land nearby, in part because land prices have been pushed upward as the southern Rockies become more popular for skiing and vacation homes.
 
Sell in June or Slaughter
''Unless we can find grazing land for the spring and summer, some of the ranchers will be compelled in June to sell or slaughter their flocks,'' said Mr. Manzanares.
It was Mr. Manzanares who after eight years of negotiations decided last summer to take more aggressive action. Last August, he and his wife, Molly, drove 1,000 ewes and their lambs about 10 miles to the Humphries Wildlife Management Area, pitched a tent and stayed there for four days until rangers arrived to tell them they were trespassing and threatened to truck away the sheep if Mr. Manzanares did not move them. By then, widespread attention had been drawn to the controversy.
Mr. Manzanares regards the trespassing charges against him, which were dropped in February, as comparable to the New England colonists' dumping tea into Boston Harbor. ''A law was broken,'' he said, ''but protest is still a viable part of America.''
State officials say the wildlife areas, acquired with money from hunting and fishing licenses and taxes on sports equipment, are for wildlife only. Legally, they may not be used by domestic livestock.
''Sheep and elk do not mix,'' said Gerald Maestas, chairman of the State Game Commission. ''When sheep move in, elk move out.''
 
In Defense of Sheep
The ranchers cite research showing that carefully managed bands of sheep improve grazing land used by wild creatures. The sheep eat undesirable vegetation and their grazing aerates and improves the soil.
Dr. Lyle McNeal of Utah State University, who has helped the ranchers, said, ''Ganados's problem is to convince fish and game officials about what we know about sheep grazing.''
An effort last fall by Gov. Garrey Carruthers to have a special group work up a long-range grazing plan foundered in December, with each party blaming the other.
The opponents of grazing say they are being skillfully maneuvered into the role of villains by the co-founder of Ganados, Maria Varela, who was a civil rights activist in Alabama and Mississippi in the 1960's. Ms. Varela, who has a degree in regional planning, won good will in 1969 by helping to create a health care system for 2,000 New Mexico families.
''Unique rural cultures in this nation are every bit as endangered as wildlife,'' said Ms. Varela. ''If the environmental movement is to survive, it must recognize this situation.''
 
Saving the Small Society
Pia Maybury-Lewis, executive secretary of Cultural Survival, an organization founded by Harvard University social scientists, says there is a false assumption that small traditional societies are bound to disappear. ''Those who disagree are dismissed as antiquarians trying to stem the tide of history, or sentimentalists,'' she said. ''Such societies tend to be dispossessed or extinguished simply because they are weak and tempting targets.''
William R. Waldman of the Nature Conservancy in New Mexico says the issues are not as clear-cut as sometimes presented by the Ganados supporters.
''Wildlife preserves make up only 3 1/2 percent of the total acreage in Rio Arriba County,'' he said, ''and consequently it is inaccurate to point to the small reserved areas as somehow taking away or limiting opportunities for sheep grazers.''
But to others the issues involve permitting the people to hold on to their dwindling lands and their cultural heritage. ''I have a 14-year-old son,'' said Johanna Terrazaz, director of Tierra Wools, ''and I want him to have a future with dignity, not find the only job he can get is cleaning bedrooms in a resort hotel.''

HEADLINE: Colombia Votes for Courage

 BODY:
Cesar Gaviria Trujillo's victory in Colombia's presidential election sends a brave message to the drug cartels, and to Washington.
The election was an expression of citizen outrage. Last August, drug traffickers brazenly assassinated Luis Carlos Galan, the incumbent Liberal Party's presidential candidate. Mr. Gaviria, who was his campaign manager, courageously took over the candidacy. 
He did so in the midst of an aggressive anti-drug campaign launched by the outgoing president, Virgilio Barco Vargas. Colombian police rooted drug traffickers out of their luxurious compounds, seized airplanes, vehicles, weapons and drugs, and blew up jungle factories. The traffickers responded with bombings, kidnappings and more killings. Mr. Gaviria vowed to keep fighting.
There were moments when his strategy seemed foolhardy; some Colombians favored negotiation with the cartels. But he stood fast. As threats mounted, he limited his public appearances and gave interviews from a bunker. His persistence paid off. The traffickers failed to carry out threats of Election Day bombings and Mr. Gaviria won 47 percent of the vote.
The result vindicates U.S. support for an anti-drug strategy developed with the Presidents of Colombia, Peru and Bolivia in February. Substantial U.S. military aid money began to flow this month and Washington has begun to reshape trade policies to help the Colombian economy.
Recently, the U.S. relaxed heavy restrictions on imports of Colombian flowers. Colombia also suffers from a decline in coffee prices that followed the collapse of the International Coffee Agreement last year. Reviving the agreement depends on negotiations with Brazil's new President, Fernando Collor de Mello, a process the U.S. could promote.
Helping Colombia's legitimate economy is only part of Washington's obligation. As Mr. Gaviria pointedly observes, Colombia's drug problem arises from the demand for cocaine in the United States. If he is willing to risk his life, and his constituents are willing to endure more violence, why does Washington remain so grudging about finding money for drug treatment and law enforcement at home?

HEADLINE: ON MY MIND;
The Cruel Delusion

BYLINE: By A. M. Rosenthal

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
And now the great delusion is being played out here, the Soviet and American actors walking about and reciting their lines, hoping that the world believes the play is reality.
That is what the summit meeting is becoming, a stage where a fantasy is being acted out - somehow, the United States, if only it wished, could save Mikhail Gorbachev and the Soviet Union from the consequences of 70 years of Soviet Communist economic corruption, political despotism, imperialism abroad and colonialism at home.
We are all entitled to fantasies but not when others suffer from them. The victims this time will be the Soviet people if they take fantasy for truth. 
The fantasy obscures the fact that only the Soviet people can save their country, and so it delays their self-rescue. It is not just a delusion that is being acted out, but a cruel one.
At a Washington news conference held by Soviet economists, journalists and propagandists, an American woman listens to an hour of talk about nuclear arms control, Germany, the shape of the new Europe, and then gets up to say that is all very well, but what plans does the Soviet leadership have to get food on Moscow's empty shelves?
For an answer she gets a sneer from Georgi Arbatov, who has sneered for all Soviet Governments for decades - what answers does the lady have herself?
In Moscow a shopper is asked by American TV what she hopes will come out of the summit meeting from America. The United States should send some fruit, she says.
Not all the oranges in Florida and all the wheat in Kansas will fill Soviet shelves for more than a few days. It is not food that the Soviet Union needs, but a system that would encourage farmers to grow it, teach consumers to expect to pay reasonably for it and help shoppers conquer their entirely reasonable fear that anything on the shelves will be gone tomorrow so hoard today, for survival's sake.
Mr. Gorbachev comes to Washington at a time when perestroika's failure has not only slashed his personal stature but deprived his Government of writ or mandate - which means power to govern - in many parts of the Soviet Union.
The United States cannot patch up the Soviet economy because it is not a leaking tire, it is a blowout. Anyway, our current and past Administrations have left us at the point where we cannot even rescue Panama.
President Gorbachev might have saved the Soviet Union from economic disaster. His first step had to be scrapping the Communist political and economic system altogether.
The confusion he has created in his country - one step forward by encouraging talk about a free economy, two steps back by insisting he is a Communist and showing it with economic half-measures - has made it too late for the Soviet Union to avoid the avalanche.
In Washington, Soviet economists play their part in the cruel delusion by asking for long-term American credits to help the Kremlin. At the same time, they barely conceal their contempt for Mr. Gorbachev and his ideological hesitations.
They do not seem to see the contradiction between saying the past five years have been a failure and asking for long-term credits for the same management. Or maybe they figure this country is dotty about Mr. Gorbachev so they might as well take advantage of it while they can for the Soviet Government.
Which Government and what kind? Boris Yeltsin's victory shows that in the Russian heartland as in the colonized republics there is an unstoppable drive for freedom from Moscow's domination. Mr. Gorbachev is not the first Soviet President but he could be the last.
One fear keeps alive in the West the desire to save the Moscow regime: After Gorbachev, Fascism. Soviet hate peddlers are crawling from under the rocks where Soviet Governments allowed them to breed. Mr. Gorbachev appointed one, Valentin Rasputin, to his presidential council.
But more leaders of an anti-Fascist, anti-Communist, pro-democracy movement are emerging. They are more likely to follow Mr. Gorbachev than some of the rightist zealots with whom he likes to flirt.
In any case, the Soviet people will determine whether their future leads to more tyranny or liberty.
But to commit American strength to Mr. Gorbachev could foreclose the future on his democratic opponents, the legitimate inheritors of the new Soviet revolution. In them rests the hope that the chaos created by Communism will not lead to another tyranny but to full liberty, at last.

HEADLINE: N.J. Transit to Raise Bus and Train Fares 9%

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA

DATELINE: NEWARK, May 30

 BODY:
For the third year in a row and the fourth time in five years, N.J. Transit is raising bus and train fares, this time an average of 9 percent.
The board of the state agency, which runs most of the trains and buses in the state, also voted today to trim service and make $25.8 million in administrative cuts that could leave trains and buses dirtier and tracks more overgrown with weeds.
The fare increases and service cuts are intended to help close a $47.8 million budget gap. They take effect on July 1 and are expected to extend the cycle of rising fares and falling ridership that, when combined with a slowing economy, has cost N.J. Transit 10 percent of its passengers in the last three years. 
Officials predicted that 7,650 riders, or 2.7 percent of the 291,600 daily commuters, would leave mass transit for their cars. Some members of the N.J. Transit board said that the estimate was optimistic and that charging commuters more for less-attractive service was no way to run a transit system.
''It's wrong to be increasing fares at this time,'' a board member from Tenafly, Eva Lerner-Lam, said. ''If McDonald's is having trouble selling Big Macs, raising prices 9 percent is just not going to help.''
By a 5-to-2 vote, the board approved an 8.3 percent increase for buses and a 10.9 percent increase for trains. A monthly bus pass between Ridgewood and New York rises $10, to $110. A Newark-New York pass goes up $9, to $92. On the trains, a monthly ticket between Mahwah and Hoboken will cost $175, up $33. A Trenton-New York pass rises $27, to $265 a month.
A proposal last month called for a 10.2 percent increase and eliminating eight bus routes and six peak-hour trains. N.J. Transit restored almost all the buses and trains on the list except for one weekday morning train from Newark to South Amboy. Locals will replace weekend express service between Summit and Hoboken. The board also froze local one-zone bus fares at $1.
The acting executive director of the agency, George Warrington, said the lines were kept because the agency was going to be reimbursed $4 million to $6 million for fees it overpaid the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey for the Port Authority Bus Terminal in midtown Manhattan.
The $25.8 million in administrative cuts will reduce service throughout the system as buses and trains travel longer without cleaning, tracks are not cleared of brush, and passenger areas receive less supervision.
Bus riders south of Trenton were spared increases. N.J. Transit officials said raising fares 12.5 percent in the region last year drove away more than 3,000 passengers, 10 percent of the 31,000 riders, and caused revenues to fall 2 percent below 1988.
Transit advocates were disappointed by the vote.
''Does it seem sensible to continue to drive away transit riders when the turnpike is being widened, tolls have been forgone and gas prices are holding steady?'' asked Albert L. Papp Jr. of Maplewood, chairman of the Lackawanna Coalition, a commuter group. ''I suggest it isn't.''
The executive director of the Morris County Board of Transportation, Frank Reilly, said recent problems at N.J. Transit with overstaffing and $42 million in overtime payments had contributed to a ''lack of credibility'' with the Legislature and reduced support.
 
A 'Symphony of Tin Cups'
Gov. Jim Florio and legislators, working on a growing budget gap, have held out no hope that money would be found to forestall fare increases.
One board member, John L. McGoldrick of Princeton, voted for the increases because he said this is not the time to force the hand of the Governor and the Legislature.
''There's a whole symphony of tin cups in Trenton,'' he said. ''We've got to give the administration time to get its house in order. But we've also got to say, as loud and as clear as we can, that this just cannot be allowed to go on.''

CORRECTION-DATE: June 2, 1990, Saturday, Late Edition - Final

 CORRECTION:
LEAD: An article on Thursday about fare increases for N.J. Transit included an incorrect report from the agency about the effect on a monthly train ticket between Mahwah and Hoboken. The price will remain $142.

HEADLINE: Con Ed Electric Rate Freeze Is Extended for 2 More Years

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT

 BODY:
Basic electric rates for Con Edison's 2.9 million customers in New York City and Westchester County will remain frozen for the next two years under an agreement announced yesterday by the utility and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo.
The agreement extends a rate freeze that has been in effect since 1987. The freeze was scheduled to end this spring.
The last time Con Edison's basic electric rates went up was in 1983. But the company's actual rates are adjusted to reflect energy costs, and even under the freeze announced yesterday rates could go up if fuel costs increased markedly. 
 
Last Increase in 1983
Since Con Edison last received a rate increase in 1983, electric costs for the utility's customers have declined substantially. Costs for the average New York City apartment dweller, who uses 250 kilowatt-hours of electricity each month, have gone down to $38.75 a month from $42.28. Costs for the average homeowner in Westchester County, who uses 400 kilowatt-hours a month, have declined to $57.21 a month from $61.43.
Adjusted for inflation, the decline represents a price drop of almost 40 percent, said Con Edison's chairman, Arthur Hauspurg.
During his eight years in office, Governor Cuomo has announced 18 rate agreements with various utilities. Invariably, these agreements have involved politically popular terms like rate freezes or even rate decreases. Mr. Cuomo has steered clear of those utility cases that involve rate increases, leaving them to be handled by the state's utility regulating board, the Public Service Commission.
 
'It's the Same Money'
Yesterday, Mr. Cuomo, who recently approved a $1.4 billion tax increase for New Yorkers, said that what happens to electric rates ''is at least as relevant as what happens to your taxes.''
''It's the same money coming out of your pockets,'' he said.
Con Edison has enjoyed a decade of substantial growth as a result of New York City's building boom and favorable changes in the Federal tax code. The company's electricity sales have increased 22 percent over the last seven years, according to Richard M. Kessel, chairman of the state's Consumer Protection Board.
Utility experts said yesterday that it was unlikely that the company would have received a rate increase if it had requested one from the Public Service Commission. They noted that over the last two years, Con Edison's earnings have consistently surpassed the 12.9 percent rate of return that it was allowed under the previous rate agreement. To make up for this, the company has had to give consumers refunds totalling $86 million.
''The company's been doing terrifically,'' said Robert Piller, executive director of the Public Utility Law Project of New York, a nonprofit monitoring group. ''Their earnings have been high. They're happy to keep going the way they are.''
 
'A Very Healthy Utility'
Before the agreement announced yesterday can take effect, it must be approved by the P.S.C. The commission's chairman, Peter A. Bradford, said that he had not yet seen the terms of the agreement and could not ''tell yet whether to applaud it or not.''
''Certainly Con Ed has been a very healthy utility over the last few years,'' he said.
Disputed rate cases usually entail lengthy public hearings before the P.S.C. But the agreements negotiated by the Governor's office are often reached behind closed doors. The relative secrecy of the proceedings has led some officials to question whether the rate agreements are in the best interests of the public, even if they result in freezes.
Recently, the State Assembly Speaker, Mel Miller, who has been critical of the negotiated settlements, appointed a committee to look into the process. The committee is not expected to make its report for several months.
Under the new agreement, the cap on Con Edison's rate of return would drop from the current 12.9 percent to 11.75 percent. The company would refund to consumers 65 percent of its earnings above the cap.
The company also agreed yesterday to refund to consumers $48 million because of tax savings it had enjoyed. The refund would be deducted from consumers' bills and would save the average apartment dweller a total of about $4 and the average homeowner about $6, the utility said.

HEADLINE: SPORTS OF THE TIMES;
Mets' Move Might Wake Them Up

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY

 BODY:
rrIn this Age of Steinbrenner, sacking the manager is so often a frivolous or cruel maneuver that it is refreshing to see a baseball club slow to push the button.
Whether through humane instincts or inertia or common sense or cheapness, the Mets' management stayed with Dave Johnson longer than necessary. In the end, Johnson's aloofness was catching, and the manager was dropped on Tuesday.
The Mets are an interesting case study in managerial relations, and not just because they are a New York team. They managed to antagonize a good bit of North America with their cocky ways while winning the most games in baseball in the past six years. 
Yet they won only one World Series, and accumulated the deserved reputation of ''underachievers,'' as Frank Cashen, the general manager, has conceded. The players should not blame their current sleepwalk on the manager, but Cashen said he didn't like the ''attitude'' of the club, and he was right.
Usually, general managers dismiss the manager because the team is 87 1/2 games out of first place by May Day, and they've got to do something to sell tickets all summer. Or there is some personal conflict that can be ended only by getting rid of the manager.
That is not the case here. Johnson was not doing anything dreadfully wrong, but the hitters couldn't drive in runs from third base and the pitchers couldn't hold runners on base and the defense was exposed once Keith Hernandez wore down. There is something ironic in a college-educated manager whose team played dumb baseball.
Malaise set in after the rollicking comebacks in 1986. Cashen did not like the swashbuckling way Johnson behaved away from the field, but Cashen couldn't quite let the manager go. It dragged on, and even Johnson seemed surprised that he was still around this year.
Johnson had been a peppery second baseman with the Orioles, flashing big words and complicated questions just to annoy the older, less educated players. As he grew older, he became involved in real estate and restaurants and flying and computers.
He is an accomplished man, weak in his overreliance on the big inning and disdain for defense, but strong on matchups and percentages, as befitting a math-and-sciences guy. George Steinbrenner could do worse the next time his finger itches.
In his personal dealings, Johnson often gave the impression of holding something back.
When he smiled, he looked angry. He seemed more comfortable with the computer or watching tapes of games than talking with the players, who often heard about lineup changes from reporters.
This was not a well-managed team in recent weeks. A few batters were suggesting that Johnson should order Mets pitchers to throw at opposing players in retaliation for beanballs. There are six bona fide starting pitchers on the squad, and Johnson could not make them all happy. The players held a meeting in California and almost blatantly admitted they were now playing for themselves.
The general manager is now saying that five years seems like a parameter for keeping that mysterious air of authority: a manager forgets the little tricks that won him a game or two, or the players get tired of the devices. On the other hand, in these days of free agency, few players stay around for five years, so a manager could theoretically outlast some of his critics.
Casey Stengel used to say that his main job as manager was separating the five players who hated him from the five players who weren't sure. ''Hate'' is much too strong a word for Johnson, but boredom had set in, on all sides.
Usually, when a manager is fired, the management looks for a change in temperament, and the players talk about their new feeling, for at least three days. The hot-cold treatment is particularly effective in a sport of emotion like basketball, but not so vital in baseball with its variables of a pitching rotation.
In the Mets' case, the withdrawn Johnson was replaced by a competent and decent man who has been with the organization for most of the past quarter century. Bud Harrelson is promising a tighter regime, but that is not easy to do when a coach is promoted.
Darryl Strawberry was quoted as saying the Mets felt ''numb'' after Johnson was dropped. Big deal. They've been numb for two months.
Given the bland makeup of the Mets, it might have been worth considering other good baseball men from the outside, with an extra dash of strength and distance, Don Baylor being the first name to come to mind.
However, sometimes a good and familiar face is enough to make a difference in the short run. In the long run, as the economist John Maynard Keynes once said, we are all dead. Particularly managers.

HEADLINE: Selling in Europe: Borders Fade

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, May 30

 BODY:
The single market of 325 million consumers that the 12 nations of the European Community are trying to create is at least two and a half years away, but consumer-products companies are acting as if it were already here.
Scores of companies are creating ''Eurobrands,'' giving products a single brand name throughout most or all of Europe. Many are supporting their products with ''Euro-ads'' - advertisements that except for the language, are similar in message and often identical or nearly identical in execution.
For instance, in Britain and France, Mars Inc., the United States candy maker, has already changed the name of its Treets candies to M & M's, the name it uses in the United States.
Over the next five years, Nestle S.A., the giant Swiss foods company, plans to replace several national brands it uses to sell Camembert cheese in Europe with the Nestle brand name. 
And the Colgate-Palmolive Company, the big United States consumer products maker, has reduced the number of Palmolive soaps it sells in Europe to only three fragrances, down from at least 10 just a short time ago, said James G.B. Williams, director of planning and research at Young & Rubicam Europe, the London-based European arm of the American ad agency.
''The assumption now at many companies is that everything will be the same unless someone can prove why not,'' he said.
Worried that presenting different advertisements in different countries might confuse consumers, Philips and Whirlpool Major Domestic Appliances, the European joint venture between Philips N.V., the Dutch company, and America's Whirlpool Corporation, has come up with a single ad concept, executed with minor variations for each country, to establish recognition of its brand throughout the Continent.
Until recently, marketers tended to focus on the things that distinguished Europeans from one another. One big exception has been the American companies that have tried to sell products like Levi's jeans, Coca-Cola and Marlboro cigarettes as a part of American culture. And companies have long sold products to the rich and the young, groups that often have traits in common with their peers around the world.
But the changes sweeping Europe are transforming the way products are marketed, forcing many companies to think Pan-European. While no one believes that the 1992 market unification will instantly homogenize Europeans, most agree that it will make it easier to compete throughout the Continent by eliminating trade barriers and harmonizing national regulations regarding both advertising and product standards.
 
Deregulation of Broadcasting
Companies are also trying to take advantage of the deregulation of the broadcast industry, which is expected to increase the amount of air time available for advertising.
And they are also trying to capitalize on the convergence in consumer tastes that has resulted from the growing middle class. Europe has enjoyed robust economic growth in recent years - prosperity that is expected to continue because of the single market. Smaller families with two wage earners, single-family housing and the means to travel have become hallmarks of the middle class throughout Europe just as they are in America.
''The specter of 1992 is causing multinational companies to think about whether they are doing the right things,'' said Neil Kennedy, executive vice president of Backer Spielvogel Bates Europe, the European arm of the ad agency owned by the Saatchi & Saatchi Company.
While a unified Europe means opportunities, it also means competition. To cope, companies are frantically creating and buying Pan-European brands or those that have the potential to be, helping to fuel the acquisition boom in Europe. Nestle, for example, has bought Buitoni, the Italian pasta concern, and Rowntree, the English confectioner.
Companies are also trying to strengthen the brands they have by winnowing their portfolios, making it easier and more cost-effective to manufacture, distribute and advertise their products in Europe.
A handful of daring companies are even abandoning strong national brands in a bid to create Pan-European or global brands. In addition to establishing M & M's as a brand in Europe, Mars is now changing the name of its popular Marathon candy bar in Britain to Snickers, even though some marketing experts warn that the move is risky, given the closeness of the name to nickers, the British term for women's underwear.
Even companies that do not tamper with established national or regional brands are more closely coordinating the way those items are advertised and packaged. Henkel K.G.A.A., the West Germany chemicals concern, uses the same packaging and the same television ad for a detergent that sells under several different names on the Continent.
Market researchers have discovered that there are more similarities in living styles and values among Europeans than they had previously recognized - similarities that seem to grow with incomes and education levels.
Jane L. Hourigan, director of the two-year-old Single Market Unit at D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles, advises her Pan-European clients to look for regions in Europe with social or economic similarities. She said marketers of luxury products might therefore want to focus on ''the golden circle,'' the 250 miles around Cologne, West Germany, that takes in almost all of the wealthiest areas of the Continent.
Euro-ads provide marketers with several benefits. For one, creative teams are more likely to end up with an effective advertising campaign by focusing their resources on the development of a single advertisement.
And at a cost of $180,000 to $250,000 apiece, making one or two original commercials rather than a dozen or more means a larger amount can be spent on quality or print space.
 
Growth in Ad Spending
Vast changes sweeping the communications industry are giving advertisers more opportunities to do just that. They also explain why ad agencies expect the rate of ad expenditures in Europe to grow faster than in the United States.
Most television and many radio stations in Western Europe have traditionally been state-owned. But the deregulation of the broadcasting industry is significantly increasing the number of private stations, including satellite and cable systems. That is making a lot more advertising time available.
J. Walter Thompson estimates that the number of television channels in Western Europe will increase to 91 in 1993, up from 69 in 1987, while the amount of programming will jump to 784,020 hours from 282,755 hours. Ad agencies estimate that as much as one-third of the homes in Western Europe will be receiving satellite channels in 1992.
The standardization of advertising regulations by the European Community should also make life easier for advertisers, although agencies worry that the community directive on advertising, now under development, will be too restrictive. It is possible that all advertising of tobacco products will be banned in the European Community.
Pan-European publications, some in English and others in multiple languages, and the expanding reach of international communications companies, many with both broadcast and print interests, are also growing. These include the empires of Rupert Murdoch, Robert Maxwell and Silvio Berlusconi, and companies like Hachette S.A. of France and Bertelsmann A.G. of West Germany. Mr. Maxwell started publishing a weekly newspaper earlier this month called The European.
 
Help With Media-Buying
In the meantime, big, centralized media-buying organizations are spreading throughout Europe to help advertisers make sense of the dizzying array of choices and to help them get better prices.
But increasingly, advertisers are having to worry about Europeans being hit with conflicting messages about their products. That is because media from one country are spilling over into another and people are traveling more.
''People are daily exposed to a multiple of messages about Opel,'' the General Motors Corporation's car brand on the Continent, said Thomas R. Mason, a vice president at Zurich-based G.M. Europe. ''It's important that those messages be consistent and complement and reinforce each other rather than portray our products in different lights.''
That is one main reason G.M. uses varieties of the same basic ''Look at Opel Now'' print and television ads in 16 European countries.

Midway Air's Gamble on Expansion

BYLINE: By ERIC N. BERG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, May 30

 BODY:
Long esteemed on Wall Street as a scrappy little airline that thrived in a business dominated by Goliaths, Midway Airlines Inc. now finds itself in a brutal competitive struggle that has dealt the carrier heavy losses. The outcome, industry experts agree, will be decisive: Either Midway will become a larger and more profitable airline or a badly wounded also-ran.
The battleground is Philadelphia. In an attempt to establish a second hub to complement its main hub at Midway Airport here, Midway began service there in November after paying $213 million for the Philadelphia gates and equipment of Eastern Airlines.
But after Midway announced the service at Philadelphia, competitors responded with a vengeance. First, USAir began more frequent service from Philadelphia to cities throughout the Northeast. Next, a number of airlines announced they would start service on the Philadelphia-Miami route. But the biggest blow was delivered by Eastern, which at the height of the winter travel season began offering money-losing $79 fares between Florida and the Northeast that were immediately matched by the industry giants. 
 
Heavy Losses
For Midway, the results have been sobering. The airline, which had a profit of $6.5 million in 1988, has lost $50 million in the last six months, roughly half of which can be traced to the Philadelphia gambit.
The losses have wiped out more than a third of Midway's net worth, which stood at $87 million at March 31, and whittled the airline's cash position to a skinny $10.3 million as of that date from $33.2 million a year earlier. Moreover, the betting on Wall Street is that this year Midway will lose an additional $5 million to $20 million, depending on whose analysis one is using.
Industry experts say Midway's experience in Philadelphia has a significance extending beyond this one airline. They say it shows how deregulation, rather than creating an environment in which dozens of airlines of all sizes can compete, has in fact created an industry in which there are essentially two groups: the giants, like United, Delta and American, with their enormous route systems and fleets, and much smaller regional carriers. The experts say there is little, if any, room for airlines like Midway that are trying to become midsized carriers. Any time a smaller carrier tries to expand by going up against a giant, it suffers a battering similar to that Midway is experiencing in Philadelphia.
''In general, in order to be a survivor over the long haul, an airline will either have to be very, very small or in the big leagues with a lot of international routes,'' said Nawal Taneja, a professor of airline management at Ohio State University.
 
Prospered on Shorter Flights
Midway is betting that such thinking is wrong, and it argues that it has no choice but to become a larger carrier. Founded in 1979 by David R. Hinson, a former Northwest Airlines pilot who at 56 is now Midway's chairman and chief executive, Midway started by serving Midwestern cities. While United and American battled each other for control of long-haul flights out of O'Hare Airport, Midway prospered by focusing on shorter flights. And it was no minor advantage to Midway to be able to fly out of Midway Airport, which is closer to downtown Chicago than O'Hare.
At a time when a number of other regional carriers have failed, Midway's niche strategy continues to be highly profitable in Chicago. And demand for airline service is expected to expand in the next few years.
Midway thinks that holding its share of the market is important because it needs a critical mass to support advertising, frequent-flier programs, special promotions and the like. But for Midway to reap its share of that business, the airline must add flights, and it can grow only so much at Midway Airport, which with an area of one square mile is tiny by airport standards. To hear Mr. Hinson tell it, establishing a second hub was imperative.
''Otherwise, we would not have been able to maintain our market share,'' Mr. Hinson said in a recent interview. ''We would get to the point where we could be unable to get any more aluminum on the concrete.''
Most Wall Street analysts agree that Midway had little choice but to expand. They even acknowledge that Philadelphia made sense for a second hub - partly because Eastern's assets became available but mostly because that city's airport had been relatively underutilized.
 
Losses at $100,000 a Day
Midway has sold a good number of seats on Philadelphia flights - the airline's systemwide ''load'' factor has held steady at around 60 percent. But fares - particularly from the Northeast to Florida - have been well below management's expectations. For example, Midway has received less than $69, after taxes and commissions to travel agents, on a one-way Philadelphia-to-Miami flight. The net result at Midway has been losses exceeding $100,000 a day. And while the losses have abated in recent days as a result of Eastern's decision to raise its Florida fares to $89, analysts remain worried.
''I haven't been optimistic, and I don't see anything that would change my mind,'' said Edward Starkman of Paine Webber Inc.
This is by no means the first time a regional carrier has tried to break into the big leagues only to be badly knocked around. When now-defunct People Express expanded to Piedmont Airlines' home territory of Raleigh/Durham, N.C., the local carrier responded by tripling the number of flights out of that airport. People Express bowed out only a few weeks later. America West Airlines, another regional airline, has begun flying from Phoenix to National Airport in Washington and in the process has prompted fierce new competition from United and American.
 
Better Times Expected
But Mr. Hinson said Midway expected to lose money at Philadelphia initially because the airline was, in effect, starting from scratch in a region where it was not nearly as well known as it was here. He argues that fares on the crucial Northeast-Florida flights will rise beginning in June. And while acknowledging that Midway's traffic could fall off as a result, he says that with time the company's prospects will improve.
Some experts share Mr. Hinson's view that the rock-bottom fares that caused such heavy losses at Midway are not sustainable over the long term.
''They cannot be,'' said George James, the chairman of Airline Economics Inc., an aviation-consulting firm based in Washington. ''You cannot have prices moving down 1 or 2 percent when your costs are rising 6 to 10 percent a year.''
The problem is that Midway's financial resources can be stretched only so far before the airline must turn a profit again. Alfred S. Altschul, Midway's chief financial officer, called the airline's $10.3 million cash hoard ''livable.''
He said Midway could sell a number of assets - from landing slots at La Guardia Airport in New York and National Airport to delivery positions for new aircraft - to allow the airline to continue taking losses at Philadelphia. And analysts say that Midway could even deplete its net worth and continue to do business out of Philadelphia; many airlines operate with little or no net worth.
 
'Always an Exit Strategy'
But while emphasizing that Midway is committed to its Philadelphia strategy, Mr. Hinson acknowledged that pulling out is conceivable. ''Everything over there has value, and there is always an exit strategy,'' he said.
Indeed, the deepest concern of some analysts is that a big carrier like USAir with deeper pockets will decide to allow Midway to bleed to death at Philadelphia.
Mr. Hinson dismissed this view. ''United and American would have done that to us long ago in Chicago if that were likely,'' he said.
But such optimism has been unconvincing on Wall Street. Notwithstanding the recent acquisition of a 12.6 percent stake in Midway by the Ampco-Pittsburgh Corporation, a Pittsburgh-based investor group, investors have bid down the price of the airline's stock. It closed today at $10, down 12.5 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange. Its high this year was $21.75. Moreover, the number of analysts who remain pessimistic far outnumber the hopeful ones.

HEADLINE: As Grain Reserves Drop, Prices May Rise

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
For the first time in years, the nation's wheat and corn reserves have fallen below the levels necessary to offset a severe drought or some other damage to this year's grain crop. The dwindling reserves help to reduce the budget deficit by shrinking farm subsidies, but they leave the nation vulnerable to food price inflation.
Grain supplies have been shrinking slowly since 1985 for three reasons. Europe and Asia, with their thriving economies, have been big buyers of American grain, making exports boom. The devastating 1988 drought and a lesser one last year forced heavy drawdowns on reserves. And both the Reagan and Bush Administrations have cut back steadily on farm subsidies, in effect encouraging farmers to ship their grain to market rather than to Government silos. 
Because the United States accounts for nearly two-thirds of the world's grain reserves, the dwindling stockpile of wheat and corn in the United States has reduced total world grain supplies - principally wheat, corn and rice - to a 59-day supply, from 103 days in 1987 and 63 last year, according to the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization, based in Rome.
 
Lowest Supply Since 1974
''We have not been this low since 1974,'' said John Schnittker, president of Schnittker Associates, a farm and food consulting firm. ''About 60 days' supply is widely viewed as the dividing line between potential serious scarcity and potential surplus.''
More than other governments, the Bush Administration has the power to keep down world grain reserves through policies that in effect pay farmers less for their grain than they would get on world markets. That has been the case since passage of the 1985 farm bill, which imposed an immediate 25 percent cut in subsidy price levels and smaller cuts in subsequent years. The upshot has been a sharp drop in Federal payments to farmers, from $25.8 billion in 1986 to an estimated $8.2 billion in the current fiscal year.
''The objective was to get these payments down so that they would no longer support the world market price,'' said Robert Thompson, dean of Purdue University's School of Agriculture. That objective was met, and American grain exports boomed, given that farmers in this country are among the world's most efficient grain producers.
 
Prices More Volatile
''The Administration does not want stocks to go back to the old levels,'' said Bruce Gardner, Assistant Secretary of Agriculture for economics.
But without reserves, American wheat and corn prices react quickly to the outlook for the current harvest. A bad one could add as much as five percentage points to overall food price inflation, experts say. That would be less than half the inflation impact of the disastrous 1988 drought, when the nation had sufficient reserves - more than a billion bushels of wheat in storage and more than four billion bushels of corn - to replace lost crops.
Those reserves have now declined to a projected 800 million bushels of wheat and 1.3 billion bushels of corn for the current crop year, the Agriculture Department reports. In comparison, domestic consumption is normally 1.1 billion bushels of wheat and 6 billion bushels of corn. Exports last year brought American wheat sales to 2.4 billion bushels and corn sales to 8.2 billion bushels.
 
'A Rather Precarious Situation'
''Given two years of drought, we have put ourselves in a rather precarious situation,'' said Michael Dunn, a lobbyist for the National Farmers Union, which represents 250,000 family-owned farms. The Farmers Union seeks higher subsidy prices for its members, and their case will undoubtedly get a hearing if the nation's grain crop falls below expectations this year.
That seems a distant possibility today. The Agriculture Department this month forecast bumper corn and wheat crops, not only in the United States but also elsewhere in the world. For openers, the American winter wheat harvest, now getting under way in Texas, is expected to produce 2.09 billion bushels, the biggest crop since 1981.
But the forecast could go wrong. Too much rain in the Midwest in June, for example, could interrupt the planting of corn, and too much heat in July could damage the young crop. Similar problems could affect the spring wheat crop.
 
Sharp Moves in Recent Prices
Reflecting the reaction of prices to the weather, rain late this month helped to push up both corn and wheat prices by several cents a bushel, to about $2.85 a bushel for corn delivered in July and $3.35 for wheat. Both were toward the high end of the average annual price range since 1983. But yesterday, expectations of drier weather conditions pushed prices back down, with July contracts ending at $2.79 1/2 for corn and $3.32 1/4 for wheat on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Until the change in Administration policy on price supports, farmers had often found selling to the Government more profitable than selling on the open market. The various mechanisms had centered on incentives to withhold land from production and on an above-market Government purchase price that allowed farmers to repay the Government and recover their grain if market prices rose above the subsidy levels.
Largely as a result of this subsidy program, agricultural exports, mostly wheat, corn and soybeans, had fallen to less than $30 billion in 1985, while Government-held reserves rose to a peak of 4.9 billion bushels of corn in 1986 and 1.9 billion bushels of wheat. Since passage of the 1985 farm bill, reserves have fallen while agricultural exports have risen, reaching more than $40 billion last year.
Although the Bush Administration is asking Congress this year to increase a strategic wheat reserve, farm policy remains essentially what it was under Ronald Reagan. ''Crop supply is more or less normal for the first time in nearly a decade,'' said James Cole, an Agriculture Department official. ''What that means is that we harvest about what we will consume and export, and we keep on hand less than a year's supply.''

HEADLINE: Trade Talks Stalemated After U.S.-Europe Clash

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, May 30

 BODY:
After a heated clash, the United States and the European Community remained deadlocked today in talks to reduce subsidies in farm trade, raising fears that the stalemate would endanger the success of the current four-year round of world trade talks.
Officials from the United States and several other nations said they had hoped this week's meeting of the industrialized world's economic ministers would speed up the global trade negotiations. But American officials complained today that there was little progress because the European Community refused to commit itself to reducing export subsidies and other farm assistance.
At the annual meeting of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, American and European Community officials said the final communique to be issued Thursday would state the contrasting positions of Washington and Brussels and would say that the two sides had failed to agree. 
American officials said the stalemate at today's meeting meant there would be little time for negotiators to reach an agreement on farm trade and 14 other trade areas before the four-year Uruguay Round of talks ends in December.
The Uruguay Round is a set of negotiations in which 105 nations included in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade are seeking to liberalize world trade rules. The round is named for the country where it began in 1986.
Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative, said today that without an agreement on farm trade, the Uruguay Round could fail. ''Agriculture is the linchpin of the negotiations,'' she said, noting that for some countries, ''it is the only issue.''
 
European Commitments Sought
In a news conference today, Mrs. Hills said she had sought specific commitments from the European Community to reduce export subsidies for farm products, increase market access and reduce farm price supports.
American officials say they want to eliminate all farm subsidies that distort production and trade flows, like export subsidies. The officials add that they will instead support direct payments, like income supplements, that do not encourage farmers to grow crops.
Frans Andriessen, the community's top trade official, said the United States was wrong to say agriculture was the key issue in the talks, asserting that there were other important issues, including textiles.
Community officials today accused Washington of dragging its feet in talks to reduce the industrial world's trade barriers against textile imports from the third world.
 
Brussels Firm on Earlier Stance
Officials attending today's sessions said the European Community's Agriculture Commissioner, Ray Mac Sherry, told the Americans that Brussels was not ready to go beyond a commitment it made 14 months ago for ''substantial'' and ''progressive'' reductions in farm subsidies.
Mr. Andriessen said the Uraguay Round, not the O.E.C.D. meeting, was the proper forum to negotiate on trade.
After today's stalement on agriculture, Canada's Trade Minister, John Crosbie, said, ''You have no reason for encouraging optimism'' on the trade talks. He added that both Washington and Brussels would come under growing pressure to compromise to reach an accord because, in his view, they will recognize that ''the results of failure will be so catastrophic'' to world trade.
 
Positions in the Communique
According to a draft of the communique, the United States proposed that all nations commit themselves to reducing several specific types of trade-distorting farm protection. Seeking to push the talks forward on a definite timetable, Washington also proposed establishing ''a framework and parameters'' for such reductions in Uruguay Round negotiations scheduled to be held in Geneva in July. American officials said they still hoped for progress in Geneva.
The community's draft proposal is less radical, talking in terms of ''degrees of reduction'' of farm subsidies, and is less specific about what types of protection would be reduced.
In a news briefing today, Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major said Britain had made no changes in its plans to join the European Monetary System someday. He repeated his statement that Britain would join when conditions were right, which he said meant a narrowing of the inflation differential between Britain and the rest of the European Community.

Stocks Edge Ahead as Dow Rises by 8.07

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
Stock prices edged slightly higher yesterday amid active program trading. Both the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index eked out new highs with strong leadership from I.B.M., Procter & Gamble and Walt Disney.
The Dow average climbed 8.07 points, to 2,878.56 - the eighth new high for the blue-chip indicator since May 14. The S.& P. 500 index rose 0.21 point, to 360.86, the second straight day it has reached a new high. 
Volume soared to 199.5 million shares, from a slow 137.4 million on Tuesday, suggesting that investment managers have firmly decided to move some of their billions into the market before prices get away from them. In a sign of favorable investor interest, advances outnumbered declines, 803 to 691, with 93 stocks reaching new highs and only 26 falling to new lows.
The market seesawed wildly throughout the day. At the bell it jumped 16 points; in the next hour it gave most of it back. It bounced back the same 16 points by 11 A.M. but then fell back. Between noon and 2 P.M., however, the Dow had jumped 24 points from its low. By 3:15 it had again given back all the gains, and it rose just a few points before the close.
Birinyi Associates said that four sell programs lopped 16 points off the Dow, and five buy programs - including a 12-minute buy program starting just before 2 o'clock - lifted the market 27 points.
Commenting on investor reaction to Government figures released yesterday showing that the index of leading economic indicators fell two-tenths of 1 percent in April, Sung Won Sohn, chief economist of the Norwest Corporation in Minneapolis, said, ''The market is saying that this is reasonably good news because interest rates won't be going up, and at the same time the economy won't be going into recession.''
Tracy G. Herrick, economist for Jefferies & Company in San Francisco, said, ''The numbers mean that the economy's going nowhere - and that helps stocks and bonds because people won't need money, and interest rates will come down.''
 
Outlook On Economy
Mr. Sohn argued that the figures suggested that ''the economy is not booming but not going into recession, either.'' He said that the trend had persisted for roughly a year and implied that economic growth would continue to be modest ''for a while.'' The indicators forecast economic upturns and downturns within roughly six months, although, Mr. Sohn said, historically the index has been better at forecasting downturns.
The Government also released figures on new-home sales yesterday showing a 1.6 percent drop in April. He said the drop had been expected and, consequently, had little impact on the market. Among the 30 Dow blue chips, I.B.M., which rose 3 1/2 on Tuesday to a new high, added an additional 1 1/8, to 120 7/8, on 2.86 million shares. The unquestioned market leader, it also hit another new high during the day of 122 1/8.
International Paper gained a point, to 52 1/4, and Procter & Gamble, another market favorite, rose 2, to 82, in heavy trading on continued favorable comments from analysts. Since the company told analysts of expansion plans overseas last week, the stock has responded strongly.
In one of the more surprising gains, Disney, which rose 2 1/8 Tuesday, surged 6 yesterday, to 125 3/4, a new high. David Londoner, who follows the company for Wertheim Schroder & Company, said he had newly recommended the stock, which he had first recommended 5 1/2 years ago.
He said he had estimated that Disney's earnings per share would grow at an average of 20 percent a year for the next five years. Stressing its ''quality of earnings,'' he said that ''it's got a 26 percent return on equity and a 25 percent pretax profit margin, which is extraordinarily high by any standards.'' Through its March 31 quarter, Disney has had 21 successive record quarters. And in a sign that stockholders with big stakes in companies may no longer cast a spell, the Belzbergs of Canada said yesterday that they had sold 4,797,600 shares of Armstrong World, the interior furnishings company, for 35 3/4.
The group, which announced a year ago that it owned stock in Armstrong and wanted to take it over, paid close to $40 share, apparently losing money on yesterday's sale. Bear, Stearns & Company, which has worked for the Belzbergs in the past, sold the block to Goldman, Sachs & Company, which has worked in the past with Armstrong.
Among other strong moves, L.A. Gear, the athletic-shoe maker, slid 3 3/4, to 43 5/8, on 1.9 million shares, after Gary M. Jacobson of Kidder, Peabody & Company said the price had gotten too high. Nike, a competitor, fell 1 3/4, to 80, in what appeared to be a similar reaction.
Bally, the health club and casino company, fell 1 1/2, to 10 5/8, in heavy trading. It said it was considering several plans to raise its stock price, including refinancing, asset sales, securities offerings and joint ventures.
Xerox fell 1 3/4, to 46 1/2, after reaching a new low of 45 7/8.
In the smaller-stock averages, the Amex market-value index rose 0.35, to 362.91, and the Nasdaq composite rose 1.26, to 458.77.

HEADLINE: Indicators Fall 0.2% on Drop in Building Permits

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 30

 BODY:
The Government index intended to predict the course of the economy eased two-tenths of 1 percent in April, largely reflecting the third straight decline in the number of permits for new buildings, the Commerce Department said today.
While this was the second decline in three months for the index of leading indicators, analysts said that the latest tabulation contained little that had not been expected and that it confirmed the likelihood that the economy would continue the sluggish pace it has maintained since last summer.
''It doesn't signal any shift in the momentum of economic activity,'' said Alfred G. Smith, a senior vice president of the NCNB Corporation in Charlotte, N.C.
 
Other Data Due Tomorrow
Economists were awaiting reports to be released on Friday on two significant indicators for May, the amount of employment growth and the behavior of the nation's corporate purchasing managers.
Separately, the Commerce Department and the Department of Housing and Urban Development reported today that sales of new single-family homes dropped to an annual rate of 546,000 in April. The 1.6 percent decline was the fifth in a row and the lowest level since December 1982, when the current business expansion began. 
The recession in real estate, however, is not likely to drag the economy as a whole into recession, the analysts said. Mr. Smith said his bank predicts that the gross national product will climb at a 1.6 percent rate during the second quarter and at a rate somewhat more than 2 percent for the second half of the year. The G.N.P. measures the total output of the nation's goods and services.
Robert H. Chandross, the chief economist for Lloyds Bank North America in New York, said the primary message of the leading index was that the strong increase for the preceding month, March, was misleading and that the housing market is more certainly in serious decline.
Seven of the 11 components of the index of leading indicators contributed to April's decline, which followed a 1 percent drop in February and a 1 percent jump in March.
Besides the tumble in building permits, the negative factors were: lower contracts and orders for plant and equipment, a shorter average workweek, a decline in manufacturers' new orders for consumer goods and materials, a fall in unfilled factory orders, a rise in average weekly initial claims for state unemployment insurance and a very slight decline in stock prices.
But in May stock prices surged to new records, including a 1.8 percent rise in the Dow Jones industrial average on Tuesday.
Pushing upward on the April index were a rise in the price of materials particularly sensitive to the business cycle, improved expectations of consumers, slower deliveries by company vendors and a small increase in the M-2 money supply. The supply reflects the total stock of money in the economy, consisting primarily of currency and deposits in checking and certain savings accounts.
''Of the indicators that increased, the rise in sensitive materials prices does not reflect demand pressures so much as some temporary cost increases,'' said Gordon Richards, an economist for the National Association of Manufacturers, a Washington industry group. ''Further, the rise in the money supply does not necessarily signal a loosening of policy by the Federal Reserve.''
The Commerce Department also said today that companion gauges to the predictive index, its indexes of coincident and lagging indicators, slipped by two-tenths of 1 percent and by a tenth of 1 percent, respectively, in April. The coincident index tracks current economic conditions. The lagging index comprises indicators that move only after turning points in the economy, confirming the new trend.
The only lagging indicator, of the five available, to rise in April was labor costs per unit of factory output.
 
Revised March Index
The leading index for March, now showing with a 1 percent gain, was initially reported as having risen by nine-tenths of 1 percent. The revision reflected a longer workweek.
A private forecasting index compiled by Safian Investment Research in New York, eased by a tenth of 1 percent in April, with 10 components up and 13 down. When stock market and monetary components are excluded, the decline was by four-tenths of 1 percent.
Yet another predictor, the leading index of service-sector activity calculated by the Columbia Business School's Center for International Business Cycle Research, rose by four-tenths of 1 percent in April, Geoffrey H. Moore, the center's director, said today. The increase reflected a rise in the average service work week, partly offset by declines in construction contracts for commercial buildings and service-sector stock prices.
Growth, while modest, ''is not low enough to suggest any marked slowdown in the growth of services activity,'' Dr. Moore said.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Securities Inch Higher

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities inched higher in slow trading yesterday, as dealers began to position themselves for tomorrow's release of May employment data.
Market participants said generally weak reports on April movements in the Commerce Department's index of leading economic indicators and new home sales had had little impact.
''The April data has already been incorporated; it was weak, and no one will deny that,'' one Government bond trader said. ''But April numbers don't matter any more. The market wants to see what May looked like.'' 
Much of yesterday's activity was concentrated in longer-term notes and bonds. Traders said accounts were moving out of positions in shorter-term notes and into bonds.
''The long end continually has a bid,'' the trader said. ''It has since we came back on Tuesday.''
Analysts at MMS International, an economic information and forecasting company, noted in their daily commentary that the price action in the last two days suggested that ''the market is looking for more weakness in the employment data than is likely to be seen.''
Excluding workers hired by the Government to conduct the 1990 Census, the MMS analysts are projecting that non-farm payroll employment rose by 180,000 in May, slightly above the 150,000 increase that is the consensus forecast among Wall Street economists.
The session's one mild surprise took place in the Federal funds market, where the overnight rate for bank loans softened considerably throughout the afternoon.
By late in the day the funds rate was trading at 7 percent, well below the 8 1/4 percent rate that is widely seen as the Federal Reserve Board's target.
Analysts said the sharp drop meant little, since yesterday was the end of a two-week reserve reporting period for banks.
''The funds rate is often volatile on the final day of the two-week reserve period, and I would not read anything more into what happened to the funds rate than that,'' said Rudolf Thunberg, an economist at Ried Thunberg & Company, an investment advisory firm in Westport, Conn.
''There is no reason to suspect the Fed has changed its apparent target of 8 1/4 percent funds.''
The Fed did provide some support to the Treasury bill market, as it purchased bills.
Analysts expected the Fed would buy either notes or bills this week, and the aggressive purchases helped push down Treasury bill rates.
By late in the day, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 7.73 percent, down five basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates fell seven basis points to a late offered rate of 7.65 percent. And one-year bill rates were offered in late trading at 7.61 percent, down three basis points.
The Fed's bill purchases took place on a day when the Treasury auctioned a $12 billion of new cash management bills.
The cash management bills, which will be used to provide working capital for the Resolution Trust Corporation, have two different maturities.
A total of $6 billion worth of 111-day bills were auctioned at an average discount rate of 7.78 percent.
The remaining $6 billion worth of bills mature in 20-days, and were auctioned at an average discount rate of 7.93 percent.
In the secondary market for Treasury notes and bonds, the benchmark 8 3/4 percent bonds of 2020 were offered at a price of 101 23/32 late yesterday, up 10/32, to yield 8.58 percent. Late Tuesday the closely watched issue was offered at a price to yield 8.61 percent.
Among note issues, the 8 7/8 percent 10-year notes were offered at 101 25/ 32, up 6/32, to yield 8.60 percent. And the 8 1/2 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 2/32, up 1/32, to yield 8.46 percent.
In the corporate bond market, the Westinghouse Credit Corporation offered $150 million of senior notes through an underwriting syndicate led by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.
The 8.85 percent notes, which mature June 15, 2014, were priced at 100, 27 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 1/2 percent four-year notes at the time of pricing.
The notes carry puts that may be exercised in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
The issue is rated A-2 by Moody's Investors Service and A by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
Activity in the secondary markets for corporate and tax-exempt municipal bonds was very light, dealers said.
Prices of most widely traded investment-grade corporate bonds were unchanged to up 1/8 point. Municipal bond prices were unchanged on the day.
Following are the results of the Treasury's auctions of $12 billion of cash management bills:

HEADLINE: Taiichi Ohno, Whose Car System Aided Toyota's Climb, Dies at 78

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
Taiichi Ohno, a self-taught engineer who developed the manufacturing system that helped make the Toyota Motor Company one of the most powerful automobile producers in the world, died of heart failure on Monday in Toyota City, Japan. He was 78 years old.
Mr. Ohno, who spent his entire career with Toyota, is best known for devising the just-in-time system of manufacturing, which emphasizes keeping very low inventories of parts to reduce costs and improve the quality of cars. Mr. Ohno's manufacturing methods were introduced in Toyota plants in the mid-1950's and helped transform Toyota from a small car maker near bankruptcy in the late 1940's into the third-largest auto maker in the world, after General Motors and Ford. 
Under Mr. Ohno's just-in-time system, parts are made only as they are needed and are delivered to the assembly line just in time to prevent the halt of production, hence the name.
 
Flaws Quickly Detected
Keeping inventories low is economically efficient because it reduces the amount of capital tied up in unsold goods. The system, manufacturing specialists say, also quickly exposes any flaws in the manufacturing process. If parts are defective, they are detected at the assembly line and the problem is pinpointed for correction.
Mr. Ohno also emphasized flexible manufacturing methods so Toyota could tailor cars and trucks for particular markets as well as reduce waste and improve quality control. As a result, the company's vehicles usually cost less to build and had fewer defects than those made in the United States and Europe.
Mr. Ohno's methods have since been copied by manufacturers in a large number of industries worldwide.
''He ranks among the production geniuses of the 20th century,'' said Michael A. Cusumano, an assistant professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who has written on Japanese manufacturing.
Norman Bodek, the president of Productivity Press, publisher of English translations of Mr. Ohno's books, said, ''His contribution to modern manufacturing ranks with the work of Henry Ford.''
 
Born in Manchuria
Mr. Ohno was born in Manchuria in 1912, the son of a Japanese ceramics technician working for the South Manchuria Railway. Near the end of World War I, the family moved to Japan and Mr. Ohno graduated from Nagoya Technical High School in 1932.
He started his career with Toyota's textile machinery operation that year and by 1943 was an assembly shop manager in its vehicle-making operations. He advanced through the executive ranks as his manufacturing expertise drew increasing recognition and was named an executive vice president of the Toyota Motor Company in 1975. He retired in 1978 but continued as a consultant until 1982.
He was the author of a number of books on manufacturing, including ''Toyota Production System,'' ''Workplace Management'' and ''Just-in-Time for Today and Tomorrow.''

HEADLINE: Gorbachev's Last Summit?

BYLINE: By Stephen Sestanovich; Stephen Sestanovich is director of Soviet and East European studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Mikhail Gorbachev used to defy gravity: his power expanded while his policies failed. But no longer. His inability to block the election of Boris Yeltsin as president of the Russian Republic is only one of many setbacks. Political tension in the Soviet Union is, in fact, so high that the summit meeting this week could be the last one the hero of perestroika attends.
For five years Mr. Gorbachev held the balance of power between conservatives and liberals; he convinced each side he was its best protection against the other's extremism. Now this strategy is exhausted. 
Mr. Gorbachev clings to a vision of reform Communism that no longer satisfies liberals and that conservatives have still not accepted. He remains in the middle, but his balancing act reflects indecision and isolation more than skill.
Last week's consumer panic cast an especially harsh light on President Gorbachev's leadership. Three times in the past six months, he and his advisers have considered plans for a radical breakup of the economic system. Each time they have backed away, producing instead a package of half-measures that virtually no one supports.
As the economy collapses, Mr. Gorbachev has tried to focus national discussion on the narrow matter of price reform. Yet the price of bread has become inseparable from the issue of political power. There seems little chance that the Soviet Union can settle on new economic institutions without also opening up parallel questions: Who should run the country? Who has the political legitimacy to oversee the painful transition to a market economy?
Mr. Gorbachev looked ready to answer these questions when he decided in February to embrace a multiparty system. But since then he has refused to explain how the Communist Party will adapt itself to pluralism.
He scorns the idea that it should become a parliamentary party like any other, with its power dependent on electoral success. That would make it a mere ''debating society,'' he sneers. Yet his reform program as a whole makes no sense if the party can retain the extralegal control it now exerts over other Soviet institutions.
Many of President Gorbachev's allies see how much he is risking. Yuri Prokofiev, the leader of the Moscow party (whose membership is shrinking rapidly), recently declared that Communists could not command popular support unless they stood for some compelling idea.
In this respect, he admitted, ''We now have practically nothing to our name except'' - and this was a jab at a Gorbachev slogan - ''the 'humane Socialism' concept.'' Mr. Prokofiev's conclusion: Without a more convincing platform, the party ''will have to give way to another political force.''
Until this year, Mr. Gorbachev could credibly argue that there was no serious alternative to his leadership. Now he cannot. The democratic opposition is an increasingly unified front with proven strength at the polls and attractive, nationally recognized leaders.
His opponents, moreover, understand better than he that governing the Soviet Union requires a political coalition, and they are working hard to build one even if he is not. The freedom to organize has brought forth a predictable flood of micro-parties, but what is striking about the process is the extent of cooperation among the most serious new groups. They are winning support among such diverse constituencies as peasant farmers, junior military officers, independent trade unionists, intellectuals and Russian nationalists.
Mr. Gorbachev's challengers are sober, methodical men animated by the prospect that the party of Lenin will soon have to surrender its exclusive hold on power.
With the political machinery of Moscow, Leningrad and the Russian Republic now in their hands, their next goal is the appointment of a non-Communist Prime Minister. They are bent on achieving what the French call cohabitation - an arrangement in which Mr. Gorbachev remains head of state but accepts a multiparty cabinet.
Any number of events could produce such a breakthrough. A national referendum on economic policy would almost certainly mean a no-confidence vote against the current leadership. Work stoppages in the mines or oilfields could escalate to a general strike that brings down the Government.
And conflicts between the policies of Mr. Yeltsin and President Gorbachev's national program may end up being reconciled only by forming a government of national unity.
The Communist elite, in short, is face to face with the idea of sharing power; many of its members see no other way out. Aleksandr Yakovlev, often considered Mr. Gorbachev's closest ally, expressed fear and resignation when he said of the current crisis: ''Everything comes to an end, and it ends instantly. The critical mass of combustible materials is too great.''
This looming transfer of power ought to have implications for U.S. policy. After all, most of the talk about helping Mr. Gorbachev - and of locking up agreements while he is still in charge - assumes that new leaders would be less to our liking. What if they seemed to be more so? For much of the summit agenda, the new prognosis would make little difference. The advantages of a strategic arms treaty with Mr. Gorbachev are just as great (also, just as marginal) as with anyone else. And if he meets the Administration's terms for a trade agreement - passing a free-emigration bill and lifting the blockade of Lithuania - the U.S. should sign it.
We should, however, also understand the impact of a Soviet government dominated by democrats. On countless issues that now oblige the West to be wary - to impose conditions because the Soviet Union remains a Communist state - our negotiating calculus would change.
Whether on economic assistance, emergency food relief or Germany's future, it would become easier to justify U.S. concessions to such a government. Soviet ideas that we now reject with little discussion - a pan-European security system, for example -could, for better or worse, be taken seriously.
To all this, some argue that new leaders will be too weak, too divided to do business with us, too preoccupied with domestic affairs. The reverse is closer to the truth. It is Mr. Gorbachev who, with no real mandate, has trouble formulating a coherent program and keeping Soviet-American relations on course.
To judge by the pattern set in Eastern Europe, a Soviet coalition government would enjoy a surge of popularity and great freedom of action. Its ability to call on Western support would further strengthen it at home. Can anyone doubt what the first visit to Washington of the Soviet Union's first post-Communist prime minister would be like?
The revolutions of 1989 showed the importance of a clean break with the past. The governments of Eastern Europe are now able to make decisions free of deadening ideological compromises. Mr. Gorbachev, by contrast, seems unable to avoid such compromises. He has brought his country to the point where a break can at last be considered, but he seems unable to make it himself. Before long, others will have their chance.
