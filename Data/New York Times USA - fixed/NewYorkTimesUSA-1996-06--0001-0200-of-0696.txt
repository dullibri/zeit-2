HEADLINE: Development Trend Evades Poverty Issue

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your May 25 front-page news article "In Post-Cold-War Washington, Development Is a Hot Business" centers on two questionable assumptions: that all revolving doors are suspect (they happen all the time in the private banking sector) and that contracts for private-sector development are especially suspect. 
 Where have you been in the last several years as United States leaders badgered multilateral banks to focus on insuring private-sector development? Other less powerful constituencies argued, without success, that these banks should maintain a core focus on poverty reduction and investments that were not easily susceptible to returning sufficient profit and hence received less attention from the for-profit sector.
As a former World Bank staff member, I also argued that the relationships between private- and public-sector development warranted more attention for both poverty reduction and private-sector development. No powerful United States leaders were willing to make that case.
You imply that these institutions are not subject to Congressional rules. These are international institutions, not subject to Congressional rules or to any other government's legislative or executive branch. As United States support for international institutions declines (witness the severe budget cuts of this past year), the amount of voice or influence the United States will have is also going to decline.
The reduction of poverty is central to the future. Poverty reduces international growth and is a major cause of violent crime and conflict. During the cold war, ideology silenced Americans in regard to the need for development. Now we need more awareness and support for international development.

HEADLINE: Slovakia's Economy Is Doing Well, Too

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The May 23 Economic Scene column proclaims that the Czechs are doing well, "with luck and without Slovakia." 
 We would like to note that it was the inability of the former federal Government to find adequate answers to the different social and economic challenges inherited in Slovakia and the Czech lands from the time of the Communist regime that finally led to the peaceful and democratic divorce of the two nations of the former Czechoslovakia.
Today, after some time, this solution proves to be right. Slovakia is also doing well.
Your column fails to provide a just evaluation of the recent developments, since during the independence years there has been significant progress in strengthening the free market economy in Slovakia.
In 1995, Slovakia showed 7.4 percent growth in gross domestic product (with 64.4 percent of G.D.P. produced by the private sector), an annual inflation rate in December of 7.2 percent, a positive trade balance and doubled foreign currency reserves.
With the Slovak currency stable and a low per capita foreign debt of about $800, Slovakia now ranks among the most successful reforming countries in Central and Eastern Europe, despite the unfavorable start in 1993.

HEADLINE: Albania's Reformer Turns Autocrat

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: TIRANA, Albania, May 31

 BODY:
When an unknown apparatchik with a big medical reputation emerged as a key negotiator in the downfall of Europe's strictest Communist government, Washington believed that it had found its man in the volatile southern Balkans.
He knew how to talk about democracy and how to expound on the merits of a market economy. He was eager to make his ragged country a doormat for American military interests. 
 But slowly in the last few years, Sali Berisha, 51, a ruddy-faced man with darting blue eyes and a frequent down-at-the-mouth grimace, seemed to show his true autocratic instincts. In the last week, he unfolded them in the open for all to see.
After what diplomats are calling the most fraudulent elections in Europe's post-Communist era, followed by the beatings and arrests of opposition supporters by squads of truncheon-wielding riot police, President Berisha has few apologies.
"Such events are not happy, but they happen everywhere," Dr. Berisha said in an interview today in his office overlooking a lush green Mediterranean-style garden. "And they are probably worse in an unqualified police force like here. What is important for the United States to understand is that you have in your campaigns the killing of candidates."
He said he was relieved that during the police attacks in the main square of the capital earlier this week, "we have not had a death."
"The police have a clear-cut order not to shoot," he said.
Human Rights Watch, the New York-based group, called on the United States and European governments today to declare the Albanian elections held last Sunday invalid. The European Union called for a rerun in some constituencies.
Dr. Berisha's failure to abide by some basic tenets of democracy during parliamentary elections is of little surprise to Albanians who know him.
Nor is it surprising to anyone who heard him at campaign rallies where in his deep, gravelly voice he whipped up a frenzy of enthusiasm with his denunciations of opposition parties as a "red front" intent on bringing back the past.
In fact, the foreign policy and domestic programs of the main parties running in Albania's election favor forging ahead with the market economy and maintaining strong ties with the West.
For Albanians, Dr. Berisha's increasingly hard line seems to be a retreat to an unpleasant past.
"Four years from now, Berisha will declare himself king like Zog," said Fatos Lubonja, a writer, who was imprisoned for 17 years after his father fell from grace as the director of Albanian television under the Communist leader Enver Hoxha. Mr. Lubonja was referring to King Zog, an interwar right-wing President who declared himself a monarch and ruled with an iron hand.
Already, Dr. Berisha's Albania carries the marks of one-party rule. Since becoming President four years ago, he has pushed aside, and in some cases into exile and jail, those who worked with him to found the Democratic Party.
He relies instead on former Hoxha insiders, including Memet Elezi, the leader of the Communist Youth Movement under Hoxha, now Dr. Berisha's chief political adviser.
Dr. Berisha insists that freedom of the press prevails. But journalists have been arrested and thrown into jail. On election night on Sunday, the Government printing press declined to publish the two main opposition papers. Newspapers are forbidden to sign up for the Internet.
Yet Dr. Berisha, who unlike many Eastern European leaders keeps his door open to Western journalists and likes to talk in his usable English, contrasted the current situation with the Hoxha era, when books were passed clandestinely from person to person like precious parcels. In this fashion, he said, he read Arthur Koestler's "Darkness at Noon," and his favorite French writers, Sartre and Camus.
As a young doctor, he was allowed a rare trip abroad -- for cardiology studies in Paris in 1978. He stayed about a year and perfected his French.
"I was very sad about the differences I saw between the outside and inside Albania," he said. But he wanted to be home as soon as possible. "I loved what I learned, but I'm linked to my country."
After returning from Paris, Dr. Berisha became Mr. Hoxha's personal physician and the head of the Communist Party apparatus at Tirana's main hospital.
Dr. Berisha said his political heroes were Churchill and Kennedy. He cited Churchill, he said, because he was "a genius" who dared to stand against members of his Cabinet "to stand for freedom."
If Dr. Berisha was hinting at a comparison between himself and Churchill, his Albanian critics would have none of it. For them, the President is on the way to becoming another Balkan dictator.
The United States, they point out, has favored Dr. Berisha with military help -- including refurbishing his ragtag army with everything from watches to uniforms and soon some weapons -- because he has helped keep the lid on the tinderbox in the province of Kosovo in southern Serbia.
Dr. Berisha has encouraged the ethnic Albanians who are the majority population there to remain passive in the face of the Serbian authorities.
"The United States is myopic about Berisha," Mr. Lubonja warned. "After he can no longer use anti-Communism to stay in power, he will use nationalism. He will be like Milosevic in Serbia. He's able to change his religion, his friends, his enemies to keep power. Hoxha broke with the Soviets and then China to stay in power. I'm sure Berisha will break with the United States for the same reasons."

HEADLINE: Beliefs

BYLINE: By Peter Steinfels 

 BODY:
The New Yorker magazine welcomed the month of marriages by featuring a bride on its June 3 cover. Bustling about her are bridesmaids and a seamstress, cheerfully adjusting the billowing white wedding gown to accommodate a very visible pregnancy.
Snicker. 
 A contrasting introduction to the season took place on Wednesday at the Carlyle Hotel in Manhattan. A hundred scholars, family therapists, foundation officials, policy analysts and religious leaders gathered to chew over ways of re-creating, in the face of divorce and single parenthood, "a marriage culture."
Snicker?
Five years ago, quite probably. For many people, talk of family values was the last resort of religious zealots and self-interested politicians.
Even today, The New Yorker cover probably speaks for many. Unlike some of that magazine's covers, obviously calculated to outrage, it is not daring or iconoclastic. It is merely "naughty," in much the same spirit as the old New Yorker covers and cartoons of sugar daddies ogling showgirls.
Marriage, the cover suggests, is an amusing social convention, verging on hypocrisy perhaps but not dangerously so; it is a veneer pasted over all the unaccountable passions and follies of the human species. Take it or leave it, but please, please, don't make a fuss about it.
That is not the way those meeting on Wednesday felt. They were called together by the Institute for American Values, a nonpartisan organization that has been trying to reverse what it calls a broad "retreat from marriage" -- the reality, for example, that more than 30 percent of American children are now born out of wedlock (the figure was 5.3 percent in 1960) or that 60 percent of new marriages will break up.
In the institute's opinion, this steady separation of parenthood from marriage is not just one more shift in history's long and irreversible pattern of change in family structure. It is a social disaster.
It is a disaster, above all, for children, these scholars and advocates argue. They cite a constantly replenished body of evidence showing that when it comes to failure in school, psychological ills, teen-age suicide, unemployment and dead-end jobs, involvement with drugs or crime and winding up in jail, nothing protects children better than growing up in a two-parent family.
Of course, as more children lack the experience of growing up in that kind of family, the harder it will be for them to create one as adults.
For experts so aware that they face a self-reinforcing problem, the meeting on Wednesday was remarkably optimistic.
Its premise, explained Jean Bethke Elshtain, the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Professor of Social and Political Ethics at the University of Chicago, was that the discussion had moved from demonstrating that a problem existed to examining concrete ideas for solutions.
So a panel traded ideas about limiting no-fault divorce laws, establishing mandatory waiting periods or new custody and child-support arrangements, distinguishing sharply between divorces of childless couples and those of parents, increasing the tax allowance for dependent children.
They surveyed a menu of recent initiatives in Indianapolis to reduce teen-age pregnancies. They talked of church-based marriage preparation and screening programs, of techniques and programs for supporting marriages before troubles became irreparable, of the media's impact -- positive and negative.
No one pretended to possess a panacea or to expect a return to some sunny past. But no one questioned the discussion's premise either. Is there truly a consensus among opinion-shapers that strengthening marriage and the family is a legitimate object of public policy?
What of the view that marriage is strictly the province of private choices, about which government and even private institutions like corporations or the media should remain resolutely neutral? Doesn't that view remain entrenched at least to the point that serious discussion is apt to be greeted with suspicion if not outright derision?
Consider a report on "the movement to save marriage" in the May 6 issue of The New Republic, a journal that has increasingly shifted its focus away from politics to the charting of cultural moods.
People like those at the Institute for American Values were labeled "family values crusaders" and "new divorcephobes"; they were "family boosters" and "cheerleaders," dispensing "Victorian wisdom" (the worst kind, evidently) and "doomsday statistics."
Along with this general tone of superiority, the author adopted the religious vocabulary so often wielded to belittle something as oppressive and unreasonable. William Galston, a former policy adviser to President Clinton, was a "disciple" of the anti-divorce movement; another advocate of strengthening marriages was a "preacher" with "acolytes" and a "miracle program."
That article, to be sure, was followed by a contrasting one. There, the liberal author affirmed that "as conservatives tirelessly and rightly point out, marriage is society's most fundamental institution."
"Marriage is a deal between a couple and society," he wrote, "not just between two people." The author even defended the cluck-clucking of grandparents and mom's "well-justified preference" that "her little girl would settle down" -- indeed he praised all of society's "subtle but important pressure to form and sustain unions."
"If marriage is to work it cannot be merely a 'life style option,' " he concluded: "It must be privileged. That is, it must be understood to be better, on average, than other ways of living. Not mandatory, not good where everything else is bad, but better: a general norm, rather than a personal taste."
Given the irony that now rules public debate, it hardly seems necessary to add: the second article was written to advocate gay marriage.

HEADLINE: Talk of Fed Rate Rise Sends Bonds Over 7% for a Time

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices tumbled yesterday after talk of an increase in interest rates coming sooner than expected rattled a market already nervous about a strong economy and inflation.
The selloff briefly pushed the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond -- a benchmark for mortgages and other consumer rates -- above the psychologically important level of 7 percent. Bond yields move in the opposite direction from their prices. 
 Bond prices have been held down recently by reports pointing to robust economic growth and by comments from Federal Reserve officials that led some analysts to believe that an increase in short-term interest rates was in the offing.
But comments by a former Federal Reserve governor elevated concerns about growth and rates yesterday. The former Fed governor, Lyle E. Gramley, said he expected that the Fed would raise the Federal funds rate by 50 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, when its policy makers meet in July. Many market participants have been expecting an increase of 25 basis points sometime in the fall.
While analysts dismissed the idea of a quick Fed rate increase, the reaction to Mr. Gramley's remarks illustrated the growing nervousness of the market.
Market participants have been surprised several times already this year -- most notably in March, after a strong employment report dashed expectations of weak growth and steady rates -- and so they are anxious about any possible sign of a change in the direction of the economy or interest rates.
Such uncertainty means that the words of an official who left the Federal Reserve in 1985 are given greater weight than they might otherwise have received.
And traders and analysts will be closely watching next Friday's report on employment for signs of a turning point for the market.
The price of the 30-year bond fell 20/32 yesterday, to 8725/32 , pushing its yield up to 6.98 percent, from 6.92 percent on Thursday. As prices fell, investors who bought bonds after strong two-year note and five-year note auctions this week, sold off to limit their losses.
Many analysts say they do not expect Fed policy makers to raise rates when the policy-making committee, the Federal Open Market Committee, meets in July. The Fed last adjusted rates in January, when it lowered the target for overnight bank loans by a quarter of a percentage point.
"Federal Open Market Committee members are more likely to tighten over the coming few months than they are to ease, but the odds-on bet is still that they will do nothing through the summer months," said Greg Jones, economist for MMS International of San Francisco.
Recent comments by Fed officials, he said, have told the market only what it already knows: that the economy has picked up and the Fed is concerned about inflation.
"There has unquestionably been a deepening concern at the Fed regarding the strength of the economy and the potential for building inflationary pressures," Mr. Jones said. "But with short-term rates roughly 150 basis points higher than 1995 lows and bond yield 100 basis points higher, it would seem safe to say the market has already incorporated such concerns into prices."
Wayne Schmidt, fixed-income portfolio manager at Mimlic Asset Management of St. Paul, said that concerns about a rise in interest rates were aggravated after the Chicago Association of Purchasing Management reported yesterday that its index rose to 53 in May from 52 in April, suggesting business was expanding at a faster pace.
Mr. Schmidt said investors and traders were also kept on edge by speculation that the Magellan fund, which owns nearly $11 billion of Treasury securities, might be selling some of its holdings.

HEADLINE: Mayor Broke Budget Vow On Children, Critics Say

BYLINE: By JOE SEXTON 

 BODY:
When Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani proposed his new budget, a document that runs thousands of pages and deals with scores of agencies, he made one clear-cut promise: There would be no reduction in spending to protect the city's most vulnerable children. The Mayor, in fact, made that his central boast when he unveiled his proposal at City Hall last month.
But City Council members, child welfare experts and foster-care providers who have studied the document say it doesn't live up to the promise. 
 While not calling it a budget cut, Mr. Giuliani has ordered the city's child welfare agency to come up with nearly $30 million in savings over the next year, a measure that the plan's critics say could result in reductions of programs and services. They say, too, that Mr. Giuliani has not provided roughly $7 million to finance a promised group of child abuse prevention programs, from drug treatment efforts to family counseling work, in 16 Beacon schools.
While the dollars at stake account for only a tiny fraction of the agency's $1.2 billion allocation, the critics assert that a failure to finance any program protecting children amounts to a betrayal of sorts by the Mayor. They say the directive to find $28.7 million in savings could ultimately result in reduced payments to foster-care agencies at a time when more and more children are being taken into protective custody.
"Totally disingenuous," Stephen DiBrienza, the chairman of the City Council's General Welfare Committee, said of the Mayor's insistence that there were no cuts in the budget for Children's Services. "A cut is a cut is a cut, and they are there. Everyone should stop pretending they are not."
Administration officials, though, maintain there is no need for pretense. Nicholas Scoppetta, the commissioner of the Administration for Children's Services, said that the $28 million shortfall that the Mayor has ordered recouped was caused by a delay in implementing the agency's managed-care program. But he said he had met with foster care providers to find the savings by moving children on to formal adoption more efficiently.
"The Mayor has shown a remarkable commitment given the economic circumstances we are dealing with," Mr. Scoppetta said.
The debate over the real meaning of the Giuliani administration's budget is a familiar one. Independent analysts, bond raters and political antagonists have all regularly taken exception to the way the Mayor purports to balance his budgets.
And this time, his critics are calling the administration's budgetary theorizing dubious. They argue that any savings from greater efficiency in moving children to adoption may not be realized for years. And they say that such efficiency will be all the more difficult given the administration's aggressive efforts to limit child abuse: namely the striking increase in the numbers of children taken into protective custody.
"The numbers say there are cuts," said Fred Brancata, president of the Council of Family and Child Care Agencies, an umbrella organization that represents the city's private nonprofit foster care agencies. "And it has to be remembered that this budget comes after years of devastating reductions."
Indeed, last spring the state cut its financing to the city for child welfare by $132 million under the new system of block grants. And that followed two years of Mr. Giuliani's own multimillion-dollar reductions in staff and services at the child welfare agency. Mr. Scoppetta, who has lobbied the State Legislature, is pessimistic about any significant increase in dollars.
Mr. Scoppetta insisted that the $7 million in other preventive programs not included in the budget was not really a reduction since he hadn't provided funds for them in last year's budget, either. The funds, he noted, had been restored to the budget last year by the City Council.
Mr. Scoppetta added that he has been struggling for weeks merely to understand how his agency had spent its hundreds of millions of dollars in recent years, and that eliminating waste could well result in the agency's being able to offer more and improved services.

HEADLINE: WORKFARE RULES CAUSE ENROLLMENT TO FALL, CUNY SAYS

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
New rules introduced by the Giuliani administration that require all welfare recipients to work have led thousands of students and would-be students to drop out of college or not enroll, according to officials at the City University of New York.
The decline in enrollment is significant, CUNY officials say, because studies show that college gives people on welfare a good chance to get better jobs at higher pay. City officials say that job experience is more important. 
 At CUNY, which has more students on welfare than any other college or university in the state, the number of those students has already dropped 17 percent from 27,000 a year ago. About 22,000 of CUNY's 206,500 students -- more than 11 percent -- are on welfare.
Although the officials acknowledge that students might be dropping out for other reasons, like rising tuition and shrinking financial aid, they say the vast majority have left because of the welfare restrictions and point out that total enrollment has fallen only 3 percent in the last year.
In addition, CUNY officials say they are seeing sharp declines in the number of students on welfare registering for the fall semester.
Sergio Hernandez, president of the Bronx Community College student government, is one of those who is dropping out. Mr. Hernandez, who has been studying to be a nuclear medicine technician, said he tried to mesh workfare and education but said the workfare assignments conflicted with many of his classes.
"Now I'm dropping out of school and looking for employment," he said. "I'm hurting because I feel the education and the chance to get into this field would have given me a chance to survive in the real world."
W. Ann Reynolds, the CUNY Chancellor, voiced similar concerns this week. "A college education is the surest way off welfare and to a successful life," she said.
But New York City officials say that holding any job -- like the street-sweeping and park-cleaning positions that they assign to welfare recipients -- might be the surest way out of welfare. Some recent studies support that argument.
"We think this is the best way to get people off welfare," said Marva L. Hammons, Commissioner of Human Resources for New York City. "The work experience program is designed to help give people experience that will help sell them to employers."
She added that the work requirement is not meant to keep welfare recipients from attending college, because many people find a way to go to college and work. And she questioned whether the declines are a result of the new work requirements. She suggested that a better economy, more job opportunities and other factors could also be responsible.
But CUNY officials and others say that such a sharp decline can be explained only by the new work rules.
"That is just not a credible argument," said City Councilman Stephen DiBrienza, a Democrat from Brooklyn and chairman of the Council's General Welfare Committee. "There is no question that there is a connection between the new work requirement and the declining enrollments," he said.
Mr. Hernandez, 39, says he knows the disappointment that awaits those like him who try to get decent jobs without anything more than a high school diploma. He was in the United States Marine Corps for five years but left in 1980 after he injured his shoulder. He said he tried to get jobs with the Police, Correction and Sanitation Departments but was told that the injury disqualified him.
Instead, he has held a string of jobs that have evaporated under him. A job training program on Wall Street ended with the 1987 stock market crash. An investigative job ended when the lawyer he worked for joined another firm. A job as a store detective ended when the store was doing poorly. The list goes on.
"Some people on welfare don't really care," he said. "But me, I was always up ahead. I just wanted to get an education and a good job."
Mr. Hernandez was part of the first phase of workfare, which started last fall. At that time the Giuliani administration announced that able-bodied single people without children, who receive money under the state's Home Relief program, would be required to work 26 hours a week. The city assigns jobs ranging from picking up litter in parks to cleaning up the Staten Island Ferry. The number of students on Home Relief at CUNY has fallen to 5,169 this semester, from 10,512 a year ago. Only 300 Home Relief recipients have enrolled at CUNY as freshmen or transfer students for the fall, down from about 3,000 in previous years.
The second phase of the workfare program began in April, as New York City started requiring people who receive money under the Federal welfare program, Aid to Families With Dependent Children, to work at least 20 hours a week or lose public assistance for themselves and their children. Only about 8,000 of the city's approximately 320,000 adult A.F.D.C. recipients have been placed in workfare jobs so far, Ms. Hammons said.
In addition to instituting the new work rules, New York City has tightened regulations that affect students on welfare. For instance, the city provides child-care support and travel money for about 7,500 students on welfare. But under its new regulations, the Giuliani administration is also limiting the support it will provide to two years, rather than three.
Some A.F.D.C. recipients are already concerned about how they are going to cope. Only 2,000 have registered to enter CUNY this fall as freshmen or transfer students, down from about 5,000 in past years. This spring, before workfare was imposed, their number had grown slightly, to 17,108, up from 16,457 a year ago.
"It's going to be very difficult," said Phadine Wormly, 41, a single mother on welfare with four children. Ms. Wormly, who is majoring in elementary education and anthropology at Queens College, is particularly concerned that a workfare assignment will conflict with her required student teaching next year, as well as her class work. She has not yet been called for a workfare appointment.
Commissioner Hammons said that her agency will try to be "a bit more flexible" in arranging where and when work assignments will be for the A.F.D.C. population in general and for students in particular.
CUNY also is trying to make the workfare program more convenient for students by asking the city to give welfare students jobs on campus. A bipartisan bill in the State Legislature, sponsored by Senator John J. Marchi, a Staten Island Republican, and Assemblyman Roberto Ramirez, a Bronx Democrat, has the same aim. It calls for welfare officials to try to allow welfare recipients to meet their workfare obligations at sites on or close to campuses.
Two pilot projects at Fiorello H. La Guardia Community College and Herbert H. Lehman College this fall will involve 50 of the top students on each campus. Other than that, the city has declined to designate campuses as workfare sites, saying that colleges might not be willing to provide the close supervision that participants must have.
The New York City workfare program is part of a broader move nationwide to require all welfare recipients to work, based in part on the belief that making people work immediately will make welfare less attractive and lower the number of welfare recipients and the cost of welfare programs.
The move is a shift in the direction of less than a decade ago, when Congress, in a major welfare reform act in 1988, put more emphasis on education and training for welfare recipients to try to make them better job candidates later.
But a growing number of cities and states, impatient with the continuing high cost of welfare, have made a job the top priority, letting education and training fall into the background.
Some of them have pointed to studies that suggest that pressing people to find work right away is the best route to moving people off welfare rolls. In one widely cited study, the Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation of New York City examined six counties in California, some that placed more emphasis on giving welfare recipients more training and education, and one that put more emphasis on pushing welfare recipients into jobs right away. The one with the emphasis on finding quick employment showed better results in moving welfare recipients into jobs and in cutting welfare costs.
"We don't have evidence that pushing welfare recipients en masse into education and training is generally effective in improving their earnings and reducing their use of welfare," said James Riccio, a senior research associate for the Manpower corporation. "A strategy emphasizing job search first and education and training for some may be a more effective approach."
But advocates of college programs for welfare recipients say education is worthwhile because college graduates are so successful at getting off welfare and staying off.
A 1990 study of more than 500 New York State welfare recipients who had earned two-year or four-year degrees, for example, found that 87 percent of them had remained off welfare six years later. Typically, about 25 percent of welfare recipients are said to remain on welfare eight years or longer.
When the study was extended to Illinois, Washington, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Wyoming, the findings were similar.
"Not only did the college graduates on welfare do better than other welfare recipients in getting jobs and in how much they earned, but their kids did better, too," said Marilyn Gittell, the director of the Howard Samuels State Policy Center at the CUNY Graduate Center, who directed the studies in all six states.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Falling Stocks and Bonds Hurt Dollar, Except Against the Yen

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar retreated against most leading currencies yesterday, dragged down by slumps in the United States stock and bond markets and further market appetite for the British pound.
But the dollar rose against the yen, bolstered by a top Japanese official's assertion that interest rates in Japan must remain low. 
 In late trading in New York yesterday, the dollar fell to 1.5233 German marks from 1.5344 marks on Thursday. The dollar also traded at 108.05 yen, up from 107.65 yen.
The British pound rose as high as $1.5540, its highest since Feb. 19, and as high as 2.3684 marks, a 15-month high. In New York, the pound traded at $1.5507, up from $1.5340.
Bond prices tumbled at midmorning after a former Federal Reserve governor, Lyle E. Gramley, said he expected the Fed to raise interest rates by a half percentage point at its meeting July 3. The bond selling spilled over into the stock market.
"His comments just sent the stock and bond markets into a tailspin," said Liz Goldberg, an assistant vice president at the New York branch of Hypo Bank, a German bank. "The dollar just followed. It does show you the market was somewhat bearish."
The dollar was further pressured by continued demand for the British pound, which has been rising since midweek based on expectations of a strengthening economy and rising interest rates in Britain.
Strong demand for British Government bonds sold this week also helped increase demand for pounds, and traders have been selling dollars in response. The fall by the dollar against the pound helped diminish its value against other European currencies.
"The dollar closed on a weak note from the European standpoint," said Hillel Waxman, chief dealer at the New York branch of the Bank Leumi Trust Company "The large orders for sterling have shifted market appetite to sterling."
Earlier, in the Asian trading day, the dollar was helped against the yen after Japan's chief Cabinet spokesman, Seiroku Kajiyama, said in Tokyo that to protect Japan's recovery from a prolonged economic slump, "the low interest rate policy must be continued."
Traders have been speculating that interest rates in Japan will inevitably rise. Mr. Kajiyama's remarks were taken to mean that rates would not be increased for the foreseeable future.

HEADLINE: April Spending By Consumers Barely Rose

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 31

 BODY:
Consumer spending barely edged up in April despite a relatively strong increase in personal incomes, the Commerce Department said today.
The department also reported that the nation's savings rate dropped to a two-year low in April. 
 Consumer spending edged up one-tenth of a percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $5.11 trillion last month after a revised increase of five-tenths of a percent in March.
The cautious spending occurred despite continuing steady rises in incomes, up five-tenths of a percent, to a rate of $6.36 trillion, after gains of five-tenths of a percent in March and eight-tenths in February.
The Commerce Department also said that extra tax payments from high-income taxpayers for 1993, which could be paid in installments, drove Federal tax payments up by about $50 billion in April.
Taxpayers affected by the higher rates had an option of paying the extra tax in three installments, the last of which was due on April 15.
Analysts said slowing consumer spending in April, accompanied by the lowest savings rate in two years, may denote a shift in the driving forces behind the economy's growth.
"This is setting us up for a moderation in personal consumption in the second quarter," said Paul Kasriel, an economist with the Northern Trust Company in Chicago. He added that he expected only about a 2.5 percent annual rate of economic growth in the second quarter.
Strong consumer spending helped drive first-quarter gross domestic product up at a 2.3 percent annual rate from the fourth quarter's anemic pace of five-tenths of a percent. Many analysts expect the second quarter to show stronger growth, with rates as high as 3.5 percent, but Mr. Kasriel was skeptical.
"I think you have a consumer that is cautious, burdened by debt-servicing, so I just don't see the chemistry here for a major boom," he said.
Spending in April was down for durable goods like new cars, falling to an annual rate of $614.9 billion in April from $634.7 billion in March.
A report from the Purchasing Management Association of Chicago added to the impression of gradual expansion. Its business barometer rose to a seasonally adjusted 53 in May from 52 in April, with new orders and employment rising.
The Midwest has been helped by a rebound in auto production after a 17-day strike at General Motors ended in March.
Consumers' savings were under pressure in April, falling to just 3.7 cents out of each dollar earned, from 4.4 cents in March.
Department officials said it was the lowest savings rate since April 1994, when 3.4 cents was being saved from each dollar earned.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Crude Oil Prices Continue to Slip On Concern About Iraqi Exports

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Crude oil prices continued to slip on the New York Mercantile Exchange yesterday as concerns grew that renewed exports from Iraq and surging output from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries would create a supply surplus later this year.
On other markets, corn and cotton prices rose. 
 Iraq hopes to begin exporting about 700,000 barrels of crude a day by mid-June as part of an agreement it signed with the United Nations last week. While some traders said United Nations monitoring arrangements could delay exports, they expect to see the Iraqi crude flow by September.
The oil could help create a surplus unless OPEC agrees to cut production, according to estimates by the International Energy Agency. But analysts expect OPEC to maintain its production ceiling or even raise it when the group meets in Vienna on Wednesday.
"Every day we get closer to these Iraqi barrels coming out and OPEC's still in disarray," said Brian Copp, head of energy trading at the Chase Manhattan Corporation.
Crude oil for July delivery fell 18 cents, to $19.76 a barrel, the lowest since March 8. July gasoline fell 0.76 cent, to 59.12 cents a gallon, a 23 percent drop in the last month.
Corn prices rose on reports of strong export demand for this year's harvest and possible planting delays in the eastern Corn Belt.
Corn sold for export after the current crop year ends Aug. 31 rose to a total of 6.16 million metric tons, from 5.15 million metric tons last week, according to the Agriculture Department. In addition, forecasters are calling for weekend rain in Ohio and Indiana, where wet weather has delayed planting.
Corn for December delivery rose 6.25 cents, to $3.5375 a bushel, on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Cotton prices rose, rebounding from a nine-month low yesterday, amid speculation that the lower prices would increase demand from exporters and domestic mills.
Cotton for July delivery rose 0.88 cent, to 79.28 cents a pound, on the New York Cotton Exchange.

HEADLINE: More Overstatement Found For Inflation in Price Index

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 31

 BODY:
A panel of private economists appointed by Congress to study the Consumer Price Index now says that the index overstates inflation by even more than the one percentage point it initially estimated.
But at the request of the group, its recommendations for improving the accuracy of the index, which is used to adjust income-tax brackets and Social Security and other Federal payments each year, will be delayed to Dec. 1 from the original target of June 15, too late to figure in any budget calculations for this year. 
 Deferring the recommendations until after Election Day partly reflects the general unwillingness by politicians to have any issue that could lead to possible cuts in Government benefits injected into this year's campaigns. But publicly, the ranking members of the Senate Finance Committee said the advisory committee deserved the extra time it said it needed for a thorough report.
"We think it's a sensible delay," said an aide to Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, the committee's ranking Democrat and one of the first to point to the huge potential contribution to Federal deficit reduction if what is widely -- but not universally -- thought to be the index's exaggeration of inflation was reduced or eliminated.
Indeed, the commission's findings could loom even larger if Senator Bob Dole, the apparent Republican Presidential nominee, was elected on a tax-cutting platform that also called for balancing the budget within the next several years. Adjusting the inflation formula that affects Federal taxes and benefits, analysts have noted, would be practically the only way to achieve large budgetary saving in one stroke. Adjusting the index so that annual inflation is reported one percentage point lower than under the current system would cut the Federal deficit by almost $140 billion in 2005 and be worth about $1 trillion over 12 years.
In seeking five and a half more months to study the index, the commission's chairman, Michael J. Boskin, told the Finance Committee in a letter that the panel's work had "opened up new avenues of inquiry and new possibilities for recommendations" to improve the consumer price data compiled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
At the same time the economists complained that one deficiency for which the bureau announced a remedy on its own in late March was inadequate. As a result, his group of experts has raised "slightly," but without mentioning any number, its preliminary estimate of the index's overstatement.
Mr. Boskin, a Stanford University economics professor who served as chief economic adviser to President George Bush, wrote that his panel had been assuming that the bureau would eliminate virtually all of one type of defect, the so-called formula bias that arises in the process of combining price quotes for many thousands of individual items into broader categories from which the index is calculated.
Mr. Boskin called the bureau's initiative a good first step. It is expected to trim the overstatement of inflation by the index by one-tenth of a percentage point. But he contended that the agency had dealt with only one aspect of the problem.
"Our best current interim estimate of the likely bias, after all the analysis, debate, discussion, peer review and the like, has now gone up slightly," Mr. Boskin said in his letter to the committee chairman, Senator William V. Roth Jr., Republican of Delaware, and Senator Moynihan.
Officials of the bureau bristled at this statement, which they said seemed likely to undermine public confidence in its work. They replied that it might have been based on incomplete understanding of what the agency did to address formula bias, which some experts contend had contributed five-tenths of a point to the overstatement of inflation.
Given Government shutdowns and other disruptions over the winter, Deputy Commissioner William G. Barron Jr. said today that he regarded the agency as having made "remarkable" progress, insisting that it had solved the problem.
Mr. Barron said: "We found it. We fixed it. And we're proud of it -- their comments notwithstanding.".
Mr. Boskin, through an aide, declined today to elaborate on his letter. The panel's interim report estimated that the index overstated inflation by anywhere from seven-tenths of a percentage point to two percentage points, with one percentage point the "best" estimate.

HEADLINE: Mayor Urges Breakup of Port Authority

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

 BODY:
Continuing his campaign against the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani proposed breaking up the authority yesterday, calling on New York State to take over some of its functions and to create a new agency to operate the city's two airports, now run by the authority.
The Mayor's proposal is far-reaching, and it essentially recommends divorcing New York State from the authority created in 1921 to control the port and mass transit between the two states. The Mayor, however, has no authority to carry out the plan, and its prospects of winning approval in Albany, let alone among New Jersey's political leadership, are dim at best. 
 Even the Mayor acknowledged the quixotic nature of his latest proposal, which has followed a year of public criticisms that the authority treats New York unfairly and a legal dispute over the rent the authority pays the city for the airports. Mr. Giuliani said he released the plan as part of his efforts to "create a political climate where this can be done."
The restructuring proposal came a week after Mr. Giuliani issued another report accusing the Port Authority of mismanaging several of its operations, wasting millions of dollars in overhead and shifting revenues raised from the airports in New York to services in New Jersey, like the PATH trains. Both yesterday's proposal and the earlier report were prepared by Rothschild Inc., a business consulting company in New York headed by Wilbur Ross.
The Port Authority's executive director, Lewis M. Eisenberg, sharply criticized the proposal yesterday. "City Hall may be taking shots at the Port Authority, but the attack is hitting the people of New York City," he said in a statement, outlining the authority's projects in the city, including the newly announced rail link to Kennedy International Airport.
Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey, who appoints half the members of the authority's governing board, also criticized the Mayor's proposal. Her press secretary, Becky Taylor, said the authority served people in both states.
"The Governor feels the Port Authority provides not only valuable services to people in the region," Ms. Taylor said. "It is also a very powerful tool of economic development for both states."
Gov. George E. Pataki's office also responded tepidly yesterday. A spokeswoman, Zenia Mucha, said the Governor would consider any suggestions the Mayor had to save money or make the authority operate more efficiently. But she said the authority, whose executive director, George J. Marlin, is a Pataki appointee, had already made strides in those directions, such as its proposal to sell the World Trade Center.
"We've seen the Port Authority start to move in the direction the Governor believes is its original mission," Ms. Mucha said.
Under the Mayor's proposal, the Legislature in Albany would create a New York Airport Authority to operate Kennedy and La Guardia airports. The city owns the land under the airports, and the new authority would buy the buildings on the land from the Port Authority.
The Port Authority's police force would also be broken up, with much of it absorbed into the city's Police Department. The Mayor also proposed that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority take over the PATH system. The consolidations would save money and make the authority's operations more efficient, Mr. Giuliani asserted.
"As AT&T and other huge companies have proven, the best way to deal with large and complex bureaucracies is to break them apart structurally," the report containing the Mayor's proposal said.
John S. Dyson, the former deputy mayor who is still a senior adviser to Mr. Giuliani, said he believed the city and state could persuade the Port Authority to agree to changes. He noted that its leases on the two airports expire in 2015 and could simply be canceled at that point.
"We think in the end they'll have to negotiate with us," he said.

Volatile Blend Fuels a Labor Battle at Shut Refinery

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS 

DATELINE: MARCUS HOOK, Pa.

 BODY:
For some 70 years, the huge oil refinery here pumped out gasoline as dependably as the Delaware River, over which it loomed, sent its waters south to the Atlantic.
But since Feb. 1, only the river has been running. On that day, the refinery's owner, the Tosco Corporation of Stamford, Conn., turned off the spigot. It is not clear when, if ever, it will be turned on again. 
 On its face, the shutdown is the result of a contract dispute between Tosco, the biggest refining company in the Northeast, and the 320 members of the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers International Union who were employed here, about 20 miles south of Philadelphia. Less than four weeks after the workers overwhelmingly rejected broad work-rule concessions, Tosco sent them packing, suspended operations at the refinery and began a wide-ranging cost review to decide whether to keep it closed for good.
But the local dispute has attracted national attention and the interest of politicians because of the tantalizing question that it poses: At a time when gasoline prices have been surging enough to make the evening news, just why is the Marcus Hook refinery, the second largest in the Northeast, lying idle?
The answers, and there are at least a couple to choose from, say a lot about the complicated forces that drive the refining industry as well as about the distrust in which the industry is held by some consumers and politicians.
The workers here say prices are high precisely because this refinery and many others around the country have been closed -- and inventories of gasoline have been kept lean -- putting the squeeze on supplies at the pump.
Tosco executives provoked the workers into rejecting a new contract, union leaders say, by asking for concessions on seniority and staffing levels that went far beyond the industry norm. "They never intended to negotiate a contract with us," said Denis J. Stephano, president of the union local here. "They wanted a smokescreen to shut the refinery down to capitalize on the rising price of gasoline."
But the company says the shutdown shows something very different: that even with prices at the nation's pumps up about 10 percent in the last two months, aging refineries like Marcus Hook are unprofitable to keep open without major savings in labor costs and big cash infusions for new equipment.
The refinery, which Tosco took over only last November as part of a larger deal to acquire the British Petroleum Company's assets in the Northeast, had been losing money for the last three years, said Thomas D. O'Malley, the chairman, president and chief executive of Tosco.
"We knew that to make it profitable, we would have to make significant changes," he said, adding that the contract offer was serious.
Regardless of the reason for the shutdown, two things are certain.
First, refining capacity and gasoline inventories are indeed tight and have become increasingly so for several years, outside experts say. For that reason, they add, any new crimp in the pipeline is going to have a major impact.
"The closing of Marcus Hook was very significant due to its size," said Frederick P. Leuffer, an oil analyst for Bear, Stearns. "It has helped to push up gasoline prices. Its absence may be felt even more as we enter the summer driving season."
The other certainty? In an election year, a dispute like this one will have legs.
Before gasoline prices started to soar at the pump, few outsiders cared about the plight of the workers, Terry Ross, the local's vice president, said during an interview at the nearly deserted union hall here.
Now, Mr. Stephano, the local president, said, "we're getting plenty of attention." Several members of Congress have taken up the union's cause, including Representatives Curt Weldon, Republican of Pennsylvania, and Frank Pallone Jr., Democrat of New Jersey, and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut.
The group has even persuaded Robert B. Reich, the United States Labor Secretary, to have John Wells, director of the Federal Mediation Service, try to set up a meeting with the two sides to resolve the dispute. The company is already saying, however, that the refinery will not reopen this year.
The fate of Marcus Hook is important because of the effects on the industry of more than a decade of turmoil and determined cost-cutting. While many older refineries have been upgraded, others -- nearly three dozen in the last seven years alone -- have been shut down.
That has left the nation's refining capacity about level while demand for gasoline has gone up. The situation has helped refiners increase their profits after years of making do on thin margins; they are now receiving 8 cents more a gallon than at the beginning of the year. But it has also left them with little surplus capacity to meet additional demand.
Until recent years, refiners often ran at 80 to 85 percent capacity even during the height of summer, the peak driving season. But last summer, the industry ran at about 95 percent -- which, for all practical purposes, is full capacity. And demand this summer is expected to be higher.
No one has raised the specter of gasoline shortages, and prices at the pump have actually retreated a bit in recent days. One reason is that increased supplies of foreign gasoline have relieved some of the pressure.
Nonetheless, glitches in domestic production -- from a fire or mechanical breakdown, say -- now tend to cause wholesale prices to jump immediately. And a continued shutdown of Marcus Hook, which can pump 190,000 barrels a day of refined products, representing about 15 percent of the region's capacity, would be a big glitch.
Mr. O'Malley, Tosco's chairman, acknowledged that supplies were tight and that refiners' profits had been rising as a result. "Clearly, any reduction in supply has an impact on price," he said.
Investors in Tosco -- which owns three other refineries, is a major player on the West Coast and has growing interests in the retail end of the business -- have apparently noticed. Last November, Tosco's stock was trading at about $34 a share. It has since gone up by about half. [It closed on Friday at $49.625.]
But Mr. O'Malley denied that Tosco's actions at Marcus Hook were an attempt to push prices even higher by further tightening capacity. Instead, he said, the shutdown had to be looked at on its own economic terms. And, he said, it grew out of an evaluation that began last fall, long before the price pressure began at the pumps.
When Tosco concluded its deal with British Petroleum to acquire its Northeast assets for $75 million, Mr. O'Malley said, the primary goal was to get a 15-year license to market the B.P. brand of gasoline in the region.
The Marcus Hook refinery simply came along with the deal. And though B.P. had spent $200 million to upgrade the refinery over the years, it was losing money.
A major thrust by Tosco was to get a new contract with the union that would enable the company to reduce the staff and use workers in a much more flexible way.
According to the union, however, Tosco pushed too far.
Mr. Stephano, who headed the bargaining team, said that Tosco wanted to drop about 65 people from the payroll. It also wanted broad rights to subcontract jobs and to use supervisors to fill in for production workers. In addition, it sought changes that would have severely eroded seniority rights.
When the proposal was put before the members on Jan. 4, 85 percent of them voted to reject it.
The union then countered with a proposal that took as its guide the contracts Tosco has at its other refineries. But discussions with the management broke down and production was soon suspended. Since then, a skeleton crew of 45 supervisors has kept up basic maintenance at the sprawling refinery.
According to the Tosco management, the refinery was shut to give the company time to figure out whether it could be made profitable.
A review of the refinery's prospects by the Bechtel Corporation, the big engineering company, is expected to be completed in the next few weeks, said Thomas J. Nimbley, a Tosco senior vice president. Bechtel is focusing on ways to enhance the refinery's product mix for long-term profitability.
Tosco's own analysis last fall indicated that the refinery might need up to $100 million in capital improvements, Mr. Nimbley said. The bulk of the investment would go for an overhaul; also included would be safety and environmental upgrades.
Tosco has invested more than that in another refinery it recently acquired, the Bayway operation in Linden, N.J. Since it bought Bayway, the biggest refinery in the Northeast, from the Exxon Corporation in 1993, Tosco has poured in $120 million. Production has doubled, to 300,000 barrels a day, and Bayway has become quite profitable, according to Mr. Nimbley, who is its manager.
Whether Tosco is prepared to spend a similar amount on Marcus Hook is not clear, however. Marcus Hook is not central to the company's current strategy, as Bayway was when Tosco was seeking a big foothold as a refiner in the Northeast.
These days, Tosco is pushing to build up its retailing arm. As part of that effort, it is acquiring the Circle K Corporation, which sells gasoline at most of its 2,500 convenience stores, mostly in the Southwest.
In any event, even if Tosco decides to make a big investment in Marcus Hook and to renew negotiations with the union, Mr. O'Malley has said it will take at least a year to renovate the refinery and reopen it, despite the pressure from Washington.
Meanwhile, market forces might change, Mr. Nimbley said, lessening the incentive to go forward with the project.
Imports of gasoline from Europe and from refiners in the Caribbean and in Venezuela have been surging, he noted. "There's still a surplus of refining capacity in the world," if not in the United States, he said.
Thus Tosco is not about to rush to restart Marcus Hook to take advantage of a good thing that might not last.
And that means that the small group of union members who picket near one of the gates of the refinery may be there for a long time.

HEADLINE: Who Stands for Children?

 BODY:
If a true measure of a society is how well it treats its children, then America is in trouble. Far too many of the nation's youngsters are the victims of poverty, violence and substandard education that leave them without the basic skills to earn their way and advance in a complex society. That is why thousands of Americans will gather in Washington today for a rally designed to give voice in this election year to the needs of millions of citizens who cannot vote but who represent the nation's future.
Even before it starts, the event, called "Stand for Children," has become the focus of ideological controversy. It is sponsored by the Children's Defense Fund, whose president, Marian Wright Edelman, is a friend of Bill and Hillary Clinton and an occasional critic of Clinton welfare policies. Though today's rally has been described as nonpartisan, it is denounced by groups on the political right as an attempt to expand the welfare state. 
 Yet the wisdom of providing additional help to needy and neglected children seems undeniable. The most recent annual survey by the Defense Fund demonstrates that the lives of many youngsters are quite precarious.
In America today, more than one in five children lives in poverty. Contrary to popular belief, these are not mostly children in families on public assistance. More than half live in families where one or both parents are working.
Many children are becoming worse off because the economic prospects of their parents have been diminished by labor-market changes, global competition and technological advances. Young adults with limited education are unable to secure jobs that pay well enough to support a family. Some 75 percent of parents in families classified as "working poor" are either high school dropouts or have no education or training beyond high school. They are at the bottom of an economy in which more education results in higher wages.
Added to the threat of poverty is the threat of violence, in their own homes and in the community. Every day nearly 8,500 children are abused or neglected and 3 die from abuse. An additional 15 children a day die of gunshot wounds.
Poor children need better educational opportunities, better nutrition and health programs and communities where they can grow up free of guns and violence. Yet President Clinton and Congress have embraced welfare reform bills that could throw a million more children into poverty, and Congress has balked repeatedly at more meaningful gun control.
Today's marchers will include participants from many sectors of society that have obligations to children. There will be parents and other relatives struggling to raise children, community and church groups trying to provide a safe environment for them, and business and political leaders whose policies, from layoffs to legislation, have an impact on children. Ideological sniping over the best way to meet the needs of children must not impede the effort to salvage their future -- and ours.

HEADLINE: A New Start in India

 BODY:
The failure of Hindu nationalists to form a government in India has opened the way for a fractious coalition of splinter parties to make the next try. Their nominal leader, H. D. Deve Gowda, is to be sworn in today as Prime Minister. He is a relatively untested politician from the south who faces a formidable challenge in pleasing both the groups in his camp and the leaders of the defeated Congress Party, whose votes he needs to stay in office. Nevertheless, the odds are good that Mr. Gowda will survive, at least for a while. His record suggests that he will continue India's economic reforms and, perhaps more important, preserve its secular traditions.
Only two weeks ago, a coalition of Hindu nationalist parties was given its first opportunity to govern India. Many analysts predicted that they would use their newfound patronage resources to secure enough votes from minor parties to put together a majority in Parliament. They were undone, however, by the adamant opposition of the other parties to the coalition's Hindu chauvinist platform. Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee promised to govern by consensus and defer his party's most objectionable positions, including the imposition of a uniform civil law for Muslims. But no one seemed to believe that he could control the militant elements of his own coalition. 
 In a remarkable two-day parliamentary debate last week, speaker after speaker rose up to remind Mr. Vajpayee that in 1992, when his party governed the state of Uttar Pradesh, Hindu thugs destroyed an important mosque in Ayodhya. They warned repeatedly that India could not abuse the rights of its minorities if it was to survive. The debate was Indian democracy at its best, and Mr. Vajpayee, to his credit, gracefully accepted the verdict.
Mr. Gowda has a record of honest government as chief of the southern state of Karnataka, which has been one of the places most hospitable to foreign investment. Indeed, the state's capital, Bangalore, is known as India's Silicon Valley, where software for many American computer companies is made. Mr. Gowda is also a farmer and engineer who comes from a large upper-middle-class caste of landowners and is considered an effective practitioner of the country's caste-based politics.
The danger for Mr. Gowda is that with power spread among so many parties, he will face tremendous demands for government spending to keep everybody happy. That could lead to a breakdown in the fiscal and monetary discipline demanded by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.
For now, former Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao of the Congress Party is providing the margin of survival in Parliament. But he will be looking for the first opportunity to pull his own votes back and let the Government fall so that he can claim in the next election that only his party has the broad base to govern effectively. An early test of Mr. Gowda's skills will be whether he lets a bribery investigation proceed that could lead to the indictment of Mr. Rao.
Mr. Gowda starts with a great deal of good will inside India and among the foreign partners that have given it aid and investment, including the United States. He will need it to hold together his shaky coalition.

HEADLINE: Police Try to Build Bridge to China

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

DATELINE: FUZHOU, China, May 25

 BODY:
Capt. George Duke arrived in China this week with four fellow New York City police officers on a pioneering mission: to team up with local Chinese police to fight the burgeoning criminal networks that operate between New York City and Fujian Province, a rocky and forbidding region on China's southern coast.
Captain Duke was hoping to roll up his sleeves and exchange information on criminal gangs, interview suspects in custody, and discuss coordinated strategy. While he told his fellow officers not to hope for too much, Captain Duke expected at the very least to sit down with the local police chief who helped solve a New York kidnapping in February, a case of police-to-police cooperation that offered great promise in fighting Fujianese-American gangs. 
 No such luck. Captain Duke and his fellow N.Y.P.D. Blue were taken to banquets and tourist sites, and to formal meetings with high-ranking officials who assured him that they were doing everything possible to stop crime, without showing much evidence.
The six-day visit was a milestone of sorts, the first time New York City police officers have come to Communist China to try to cooperate on criminal investigations. Yet it turned out to be more of a lesson in how unwilling China's public security forces are to work with outsiders than anything else.
The need for coordination is compelling: Asian organized crime is growing fast, and fastest among youths from Fujian, the home of the vast majority of illegal Chinese immigrants to the United States over the past decade. More than half of New York City's kidnappings last year involved victims and suspects from Fujian, and many made prosecution difficult by demanding ransoms in China for victims held in New York.
In a remarkable shift, some criminals wanted by the authorities in New York in recent years have even returned to find refuge in China, terrain once considered off-limits for outlaws, but now home to a freewheeling economy and rampant corruption.
Since Asian organized crime has been ill-understood by New York City police officers who find the culture confusing, a visit by the police to Beijing and Fuzhou, the capital of Fujian Province, was arguably overdue. But it made the overly formal reception all the more disappointing.
In a moment that seemed to sum up the trip's frustrations, Captain Duke gathered in a small hotel room with three fellow New Yorkers and three Chinese public security officers to discuss the agenda for the trip's final day, and learned that his request to meet a local police commander was being turned down. A visit to a jade carving factory had been arranged instead.
"Are you telling me that we traveled 12,000 miles, and I can't even shake hands with the man I came to see?" asked Captain Duke, who heads New York's Major Case Squad, in his heavy Brooklyn accent. "I just want to meet the man, to thank him. Can't we do that?"
No.
"You did not go through the proper channels for this request," replied Director Wang Shibang, a senior officer in the Fujian Province Public Security Bureau. "We were told that you were here to discuss immigration problems. If you want something else, you should go through proper channels."
Captain Duke, on his first trip to China, was mystified by this kind of round-in-a-circle language, since he had asked from day one to meet local Fuzhou police. Two Chinese-American police officers on the trip, Sgt. Douglas Lee and Det. Hayman Goon, were equally at a loss.
It was anyone's guess whether Director Wang was under orders from Beijing to block any new meetings, or was afraid to let even a small ray of sunlight into the murky operations of a police force that was a target of a corruption probe two years ago, or was just being a bureaucrat.
At a final dinner, Captain Duke and Director Wang sat next to each other, but did not exchange a single sentence in an hour-long meal. Director Wang resisted when an American took a photo of those at the table, finally agreeing, but then changing his mind and demanding that the unexposed film be handed over. It was.
Captain Duke said later that, despite the frustrations, the trip had been worthwhile. If a single life is saved through future cooperation between the two sides, he said, that would justify the effort and cost, under $20,000, shouldered by the N.Y.P.D.
"We came, we saw, we asked, we didn't get," said Captain Duke, 55, a beefy, gray-at-the-temples man, over a Tsingtao beer at a hotel bar where he and his colleagues spent their last evening chuckling about the week's misadventures. "That's life. It's their system here, their rules."
Although they could not be sure, Captain Duke and his colleagues said they sensed that many of the police officials they met were nervous about setting up any formal cooperation with an American police department without a formal protocol or treaty.
"Treaties are not what we do. Getting the bad guys is our business," said Lieut. Peter Tartaglia, Captain Duke's second in command. "We can talk, police to police, that's where we meet. The governments can come along if they follow what we're doing."
If Captain Duke could accept most of the disappointments, one was particularly hard to swallow: the failure to meet Zheng Gaoxiong, the local Chinese police commander who helped solve a New York kidnapping early this year.
The case began on Jan. 25, when a Fujianese woman was kidnapped on her way home from work in Queens. Her captors called her husband in Fuzhou to demand that a ransom of $38,000 be paid within five days. Many families might pay the ransom quietly, but the woman's husband, an influential businessman with relatives in the Public Security Bureau, went to the authorities.
The victim's brother, also living in New York, contacted the police there. By sharing information, Captain Duke in New York and Commander Zheng in Fuzhou coordinated their actions. On Feb. 8, they rescued the woman in New York and apprehended three suspects in New York and two in Fuzhou, including Chen Feng, the leader of the gang behind the kidnapping.
After the cooperation between the Fuzhou and New York City police departments was publicized in the Chinese-language press in New York, kidnapping in Chinatown dropped sharply. Only one kidnapping occurred in the first four months of this year, Captain Duke said, down from 16 in a similar period in 1995.
Yet building on that success will be hard. Captain Duke brought dossiers on two criminals he believes are in Fuzhou, intending to share them with Commander Zheng, and hoping to get information in return.
But he was never allowed to meet Commander Zheng, or the husband of the rescued woman, or the suspect, Chen Feng.
Just being in China, in the end, was enough to make Captain Duke marvel.
"If you had come to me in 1962, when I was getting out of the police academy, and said that in 1996 I would be in China, talking to the Communists about cooperating on kidnappings, I would have said, 'Yeah, right!' "

Treasury Securities Tumble On Fears of Higher Rates
Prices of Treasury securities tumbled, reflecting fears that the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates earlier than expected. A former Fed governor, Lyle Gramley, said he expected the Fed to raise the Federal funds rate by a half percentage point at its July policy meeting.
The selloff briefly pushed the yield on the 30-year bond above the psychologically important level of 7 percent, although it fell back to 6.98 percent. [Page 41.]
 
Blue-Chip Stocks Are Depressed
The bond market's distress spilled over to the stock market, depressing blue chips. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 50.23 points, to 5,643.18. For the week, the Dow fell 119.68 points, or 2.08 percent. But the Nasdaq composite index moved up 9.95 points, to 1,243.43. For the week, it was down 4.37. [35.]
 
Panel Says C.P.I. Is Overstated
The panel of private economists appointed by Congress to study the Consumer Price Index now says that the index overstates inflation by even more than the one percentage point it initially estimated. But it asked that its recommendations for improving the index, which is used to adjust income-tax brackets and Social Security and other Federal payments each year, be delayed to Dec. 1. [32.]
 
 
Upjohn Cited by U.S. Task Force
A Government task force recommended that the Justice Department assess whether the Upjohn Company committed crimes by failing to report side effects caused by the sleeping pill Halcion. But the panel favored keeping Halcion on the market. [10.]
 
Airline Cargo Safety Urged
The National Transportation Safety Board recommended that the F.A.A. evaluate airline procedures to keep unauthorized hazardous materials out of cargo holds. [10.]
 
Yeltsin Calls for Free Markets
President Boris N. Yeltsin, appealing for the support of Russian voters, released an economic program sounding the virtues of a free-market economy. He called for continued control over the money supply to drive down inflation and for stock market and small-business development. [3.]
 
S.E.C. Accuses Comparator
The S.E.C. charged Comparator Systems and three of its executives with fraud in connection with their financial statements. The commission also accused the company of stealing, rather than developing a new fingerprint identification system. A Federal judge in Los Angeles, Lourdes G. Baird, issued a temporary restraining order, the S.E.C. said, and ordered assets frozen. [33.]
 
Consumer Spending Edges Up
Consumer spending edged up a scant one-tenth of 1 percent in April to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $5.11 trillion despite a relatively strong five-tenths of a percent increase in personal incomes to a rate of $6.36 trillion, the Commerce Department reported. The department also reported that the nation's savings rate dropped to a two-year low of 3.7 percent in April. [32.]
 
Frito-Lay and P.& G. in Deal
Frito-Lay signed an agreement with Procter & Gamble giving it far larger quantities of P.& G.'s new fat substitute, olestra, than competitors would get, for about a year. Frito-Lay, the nation's largest maker of snacks, agreed to pay at least $10 million for supplies of the no-calorie, no-fat oil over the span of the contract. [35.]
 
Union Bank of Switzerland in Shift
Union Bank of Switzerland said it would reorganize its management to become more competitive internationally, marking the first change since Mathis Cabiallavetta became chief executive. U.B.S. also reaffirmed that it would not abandon retail banking. [32.]
 
Dollar Retreats, but Yen Slips
The dollar retreated against most leading currencies, particularly the pound, but rose to 108.05 yen, bolstered by a Japanese official's assertion that interest rates must remain low. The dollar fell to 1.5233 German marks. [34.]
 
Crude oil futures prices slipped, as concerns grew that renewed exports from Iraq and surging OPEC output would lead to surpluses. Corn and cotton prices rose. [34.]

American Is Accused Of Embezzlement at U.N.

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, May 31

 BODY:
An American citizen holding a high-ranking United Nations position in Geneva has been accused of forgery and embezzling as much as $500,000 from the agency where he works, the Secretary General's spokeswoman said today.
The American official, who was not named by the United Nations or the United States mission here, is being investigated by Swiss authorities and by the United Nations inspector general, Karl Theodor Paschke, who arrived in Geneva today. 
 The spokeswoman, Sylvana Foa, said that the American, who is an official of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, is on sick leave and faces suspension on his return to the agency.
There were reports in Geneva that the American official had dropped from sight after an active investigation began on charges of fraud and the falsification of documents going back several years.
The Clinton Administration and Congress have been critical of the agency, known as Unctad, which helps poorer nations to develop their economies through trade and have demanded reforms.

HEADLINE: Thousands to Rally in Capital on Children's Behalf

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 31

 BODY:
With both parties claiming the mantle of family values, a rally this weekend to lament the plight of children in America has become an election-year battleground.
The rally, at the Lincoln Memorial on Saturday, was conceived by Marian Wright Edelman, president of the Children's Defense Fund, as a way to demonstrate concern for the 69 million Americans under the age of 18. She contends that their problems have been largely overlooked by the Government and by many adults. 
 Mrs. Edelman, a longtime friend of the Clintons who has anguished over the President's stand on welfare, said she viewed the rally as nonpartisan and hoped it would be a turning point in the nation's attitudes. She said the event, called Stand for Children, could crystallize support for the children's movement as the 1963 march on Washington did for civil rights.
But political groups on the right have criticized the rally as a defense of "big government" programs that perpetuate dependence and poverty. Kenneth R. Weinstein, a policy analyst at the Heritage Foundation, said Stand for Children "might better be dubbed the last stand for big government," because its organizers seek to "expand the welfare state."
The organizers of the rally, and of a march preceding it, say no elected officials or candidates for public office will speak. The event has won endorsements from diverse groups including the Girl Scouts of the U.S.A., the American Association of Retired Persons, the American Academy of Pediatrics, Catholic Charities USA, the United States Conference of Mayors, and Nickelodeon, the children's cable network owned by Viacom Inc. In addition, many schools and churches are sending delegations, and sponsors say they expect 200,000 people to attend.
The demonstration is intended to focus the nation's attention on children at a time when they account for a declining share of the country's population. Only 26 percent of Americans are now under 18, as against 36 percent in 1960 and 40 percent in 1900.
Further, nearly two-thirds of today's American households include no children.
"Children don't vote and don't make campaign contributions, and adults seem to be less concerned about children's issues," said James D. Weill, general counsel of the Children's Defense Fund. "A majority of voters don't live with children."
Organizers of the rally, citing data on infant mortality and child poverty, assert that the social and economic condition of children is worse in the United States than in other developed countries.
Mrs. Edelman, the daughter of a Baptist minister, says Americans should take better care of children for moral and religious reasons. Demographics point to a further reason: self-interest.
"Our investment in children will determine how productive they are, how much they can contribute to the retirement income of the baby-boom generation," said Donald J. Hernandez, a demographer at the Census Bureau who has written a book on children.
Census Bureau projections suggest that the proportion of all children who are members of racial and ethnic minority groups will reach 50 percent by 2030, a doubling from 26 percent in 1980.
"The elderly will increasingly depend, for their economic support, on the productivity of working-age adults who are members of racial and ethnic minorities," Mr. Hernandez said. "The productivity of those workers will, in turn, depend on the quality of the education, training and health care received by members of minority groups when they are children."
An international comparison by the Luxembourg Income Study, a nonprofit group based in Differdange, Luxembourg, found that the United States' child poverty rate, 26 percent, was among the highest in the developed world.
To be sure, government aid programs reduce poverty. But after considering the effects of those programs, the study found that the child poverty rate was much higher here than in other developed countries. The United States' rate was 22 percent after taking account of cash welfare, food stamps and taxes. Australia and Canada, at 14 percent, had the next-highest rates. (A child was defined as poor if living in a family with income less than half the national median.)
In the United States, a smaller proportion of poor families with children receive government aid, and the amount of such assistance is, on the average, smaller than the amounts provided in many other countries, the Census Bureau said.
Prof. Timothy M. Smeeding of Syracuse University, an economist who is director of the Luxembourg Income Study, said: "Other countries have more programs that help families, a better safety net. European countries, while cutting back many social programs for adults in recent years, have expanded programs for single parents and low-income families."
Marcia K. Meyers, an assistant professor of public administration at Syracuse University, has developed an index to compare child care and parental leave benefits in various countries. Denmark, Sweden and France score high, the United States, Britain and Australia low.
But Stuart M. Butler, a vice president of the Heritage Foundation, said: "It's not a question of being for or against children. It's a question of what is the most effective way of helping them. If we just expand and embellish current welfare programs, that will exacerbate the underlying problem. Getting spending under control and balancing the budget is a pro-child strategy."
Gary S. Becker of the University of Chicago, who won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1992, said he saw merit in Republican proposals to set time limits on welfare beneficiaries and restrict payments so that they would not automatically increase when a woman had additional children.
"It's bad for children to grow up in a family where all they know is that a check comes from the government every month," Mr. Becker said. "That's destructive of the child's self-respect and self-esteem."
As chairwoman of the Children's Defense Fund from 1986 to 1992, Hillary Rodham Clinton worked closely with Mrs. Edelman, the group's president. But in recent months Mrs. Edelman has criticized some of President Clinton's budget proposals and has repeatedly prodded him to defend the entitlement to cash assistance for poor children.
Asked about conservative critics who see Stand for Children as a crusade for big government, Mrs. Edelman said: "We have for years talked about personal responsibility and community responsibility. We all know that government is not the answer to our problems. I grew up in the South, where government was the problem for me as a black child and government perpetuated a two-tier system. Our role is to make sure that government is part of the solution, not part of the problem."
Without naming Speaker Newt Gingrich or other champions of the Republicans' Contract With America, Mrs. Edelman said, "What kind of leaders, at a time when 10 million children don't have health care, have the temerity to debate a Medicaid block grant that would take health care away from another three million children?"

HEADLINE: A Woman Behind Bars Is Not a Dangerous Man

BYLINE: By Adrian Nicole LeBlanc; Adrian Nicole LeBlanc is a contributing writer for the Magazine. Her last article was "Gang Girl."

 BODY:
ON AN AIRLESS THURSDAY AT THE CENTRAL California Women's Facility, the largest women's prison in the nation, a 40-foot tractor-trailer parks beneath the awful sun. It carries 54 prisoners from Los Angeles County.
Although it's still morning, the women already look ransacked. They have been returned to their own clothes for the county-to-state transfer, which means they are wearing whatever they had on at the time of their arrest. Without easy access to drugs, the addicts among them have returned to eating, and with the added weight, their clothes no longer fit. Zippers open to protruding bellies with tattoos of the names of children and C-section scars.
Two officers -- a man and a woman -- step forward to begin the clothed body search, which they conduct in pairs. Like sorry starfish, the women spread their legs, hold up their arms. 
 The prisoners will serve their sentences at this five-year-old institution or at Valley State Prison, the nation's second-largest women's prison, which recently opened across the street. The compounds occupy the tiny farm town of Chowchilla, where almond and alfalfa groves surround the 50,000-volt electrified fence. To the crop dusters above, the flat gray-and-peach buildings must look like a giant corrections butterfly, shielding up to 8,000 women in the 1,340-acre spread of its cinder-block wings.
The predominant types of offenses women tend to commit -- petty theft, check forgery, drug possession -- are nonviolent and low-level, yet women's rates of incarceration have steadily gone up, surpassing men's for the past 14 years. The increases are largely due to changes in sentencing and drug laws, and all the trouble that rides the particular poverty track most of these women are on. Many receive state-prison terms for crimes that previously earned probation. Between 1986 and 1991, the number of women in state prisons for drug offenses increased 433 percent (compared with 283 percent for men). Nationally, at the beginning of this year, there were 69,028 women in state prisons -- more than 9,600 in California alone. What this means is that the days of minivans with matrons escorting serious offenders to reformatory-style prisons are receding as more tractor-trailers pull into view.
In the world of corrections, an inmate is an inmate is an inmate. In the nation's imagination, too, all inmates are the same. Yet prison administrators, corrections officers and inmates consistently express an awareness of the differences between incarcerated women and men.
Nearly half of male inmates are serving time for violent offenses; among women, it's 1 in 3, and they are also significantly less violent once they're imprisoned. Women show a greater responsiveness to prison programs yet have less opportunity to participate in them than male inmates do. Men appear to weather years of solitary confinement, while the few women who receive it tend to break down in the hole in weeks. Male inmates work their bodies constantly, doing hundreds of squat thrusts and jumping jacks even when restricted to a maximum-security cage. Women, who fear the central yard, work out their anxiety with too much sleep, food and prescription pills.
Men's prisons divide the population by security level; women under minimum, medium and maximum security freely mix. Men tend to congregate by race, whether or not they prefer to in the free world. This is less true for women. Male gangs thrive in prison. Female gangs leave their colors on the street, some creating small families in prison -- with designated mothers, fathers, siblings -- for support.
Rarely do men become intimate with their keepers. Many women share their lives with officers shift after shift after shift. Men either honor orders or defy them. Women ask why.
Only 29 percent of the guards at the Central California Women's Facility are women. This fact worsens the already-ancient problems of troubled women, many of whom are accustomed to coercive relationships, when they are placed in a highly sexualized, paramilitary setting in the custody mostly of men. An ongoing investigation of state prisons by the Human Rights Watch Women's Rights Project found that female inmates experienced some form of custodial sexual misconduct regardless of the prison or state; inappropriate sexual contact, verbal degradation, rape, sexual assault and unwarranted visual supervision were reported from California to New York.
Women require more medical care. Up to 6 percent of female inmates are pregnant; approximately 80 percent have two or more children under 18. When a father goes to prison, his children often become members of a single-mother household. When a mother heads to prison, her children lose their home.
Despite the differences, the treatment of imprisoned women is based on a correctional model that is based on muddy assumptions about violent men. Here are four prisoners whose complicated lives shed some light on the experiences of women in the rapidly expanding correctional system: Angela Bolden, 23, and Sandra Maple, 24, among the few younger women serving time for a violent crime; Pamela Kaufman, 35, whose low-level criminal history is entrenched in her lifelong abuse of drugs, and Shirley Carone, 27, who shares the turbulent history of Angela, Sandra, Pamela and so many women but who has a chance to change that and to stay out.

Angela and Sandra
 
ANGELA BOLDEN COULD HAVE LEFT THE Central California Women's Facility in April, but she didn't want to abandon her girlfriend, Sandra Maple, who is doing life. "I hate to see her stay and me leave," Angela said last summer in B-yard, outside the housing unit where they lived when I met them.
They are a striking couple by any standard, but they are especially striking in this dreary prison -- their unscarred skin, animated eyes, voices that still emphasize and lift. When they aren't "programming" in jobs or classes, Angela and Sandra do whatever they can think of to do: aerobics, eat cookies, argue over who has the hairbrush and other "stupid things." Outdoors, they search for bugs. Indoors, they play Yahtzee. On weekends, unlike most of the other inmates, they venture to the main yard, where residents of the separate units -- B, C and D -- interact. Those inmates who socialize there -- gossiping, flirting, fighting and contraband-scheming -- are part of the scene known as "the mix." Their hearts are still tied to the street.
Angela and Sandra, in their early 20's, are younger than the general female prison population, whose average age is 31, but their biographies have in common the types of trouble found in the histories of older inmates -- running away in their early teens, older boyfriends and early pregnancies, abusive men, mothers in violent relationships and with addictions to alcohol and drugs. The group homes that tried to help the girls when they began to run away or try to kill themselves instead refined the destructive habits they had picked up at home and on the street. Sandra drank and used drugs and had three children; Angela just stayed angry and fought and had one.
In 1992, after pleading guilty to second-degree murder, Sandra was sentenced to 15 years to life. She was 20 years old. She says she manipulated her estranged father, Danny Reloba, into killing the man she says raped her when she was 18. "If I wouldn't have held a vengeance, I wouldn't be in prison," Sandra often says. "Because I could have let that go and lived on in my life." Her father, convicted of the murder, is serving 29 years to life. They no longer correspond, and Sandra says her family has disowned her. She has not received a visit in at least a year.
Angela is serving five years for second-degree robbery and threatening a witness. She demanded money from a woman at a bus stop in San Diego the night of her 19th birthday, a "stupid and impulsive" response to the realization that her Navy boyfriend, the father of the baby she was carrying, stood her up. A 15-year-old girlfriend who was with Angela -- the witness she later threatened -- turned her in. The court put her on probation and sent her to a residential drug treatment program that accepts pregnant women. According to her records, she threatened another resident with a fork and was discharged for being unable to adhere to the rules. "I'm like, 'Boring -- I want to take my baby and go,' " Angela recalls. "And I just, I have this anger thing, so I can't control my anger. And they tell me constantly what to do, and I can't stand to be bossed around." Angela returned to court for the probation violation and was sent to prison to serve the rest of her five-year sentence. The baby was left in the custody of Angela's mother.
These days, when Angela gets angry, she feels that the whole world owes her. The debt is the kind of childhood she never had. "Everything I didn't get, I should get, double time, now," she says. Sandra tries to hold her anger in, and down, for fear it will do her in if it resurfaces, as it has before.
Disruptive inmates may be assigned to Administrative Segregation or the Security Housing Unit, known as Ad Seg and SHU. Angela has been a frequent resident of both; two of her three rocky years in the prison system have been spent in one or the other.
In these special units, shouting is the regular tenor, above the already unbearable decibel level of crackling intercoms, televisions blasting in the day rooms and the general curse-filled daily din. During her Ad Seg and SHU terms, Angela accumulated write-ups, called 115's. Plenty of them were for yelling, as much to express herself as to give her something to do.
"I was yelling out the door, disrespect to others, disrespect to staff, yelling yelling yelling," she says. "I was yelling at the police, (expletive), all that stuff, you know." She enjoyed her growing reputation as an entertainer, but when all the laughter became a chorus, the officers called it "inciting a riot," and she would get another 115. "I was on dog status," she says, which she claims included delayed meals (staff members call them "feedings") and withheld mail, toilet paper and sanitary pads. The Department of Correction denies the withholding of food or essentials.
Long-termers who are eligible for parole frequently have two or three 115's in their central file; to date, Angela's write-ups run more than 70 pages -- for assaultive behavior, starting a fire, destroying state property (her prison-issued clothes), resisting staff members and at least one suicide attempt. She has thrown objects at the guard tower while exercising in the restricted exercise cage. She has been shot at by the guards twice, with rubber rounds out of a .37-caliber rifle, for refusing to stop fighting.
At 23, Angela believes the worst of her fighting days are over, a change of heart she attributes to coming of age in SHU. "Sometimes I feel it broke me," says Angela, whose high cheekbones add an elegance to her serious, intelligent face. "I'm used to getting in trouble all the time. Then I think, maybe I'm just better." "Better" to Angela means going about your business without commotion, "how to not get seen." But despite her troubles, she believes anger is better than the depression that seems to be a more common inmate state. At least with anger, whatever's underneath it, you express it. "With depression," she says, "you're just giving in to your weakness, and people can take advantage of you even more."
These days, if someone gives her trouble, she'll either ignore the person or mock her in the day room. If public humiliation doesn't do the trick, Angela says she may schedule a fight with her rival in the presence of a trustworthy referee, "somebody that's not going to let the other one pick up a chair, a razor." She says she is getting too old to risk having her face cut up.
Months after I meet Angela and Sandra in B-yard, Angela calls me collect. She's on closed B, a form of on-unit restricted movement. She says she is being punished for a suicide attempt -- swallowing all the blood-pressure pills she had been saving after receiving a letter that her father died. She then tore her cell apart.
While the officer was placing handcuffs on Angela to take her to the infirmary, an inmate stood nearby and mocked her. Sandra, who was watching, thought, "That's my baby," and jumped the girl. She got herself shipped to C-yard.
According to a cell mate of Sandra's, Sandra received a "beat-down" from another inmate in C-yard. Within weeks, she was transformed from a feisty girl to a scared one, no longer venturing from her cell for meals. Defiant as she was for Angela, Sandra has no fight left for herself.
 
 PAMELA
 
AFTER HER FATHER'S STRICT DISCIPLINE AND the volatility of her first marriage, Pamela Kaufman feels that her violent life with Robbie Cisneros wasn't so bad. "And me and Robbie have a drug addiction together, so there's a lot of good with the bad," she says of her partner of 15 years.
"She always woke up mad," Robbie recalls over the telephone from Bent County Correctional Facility in Colorado, where he's serving six years for vehicular assault. The first time they were together, Robbie says, she hit him in the face with a closed hand. "Of course, I hit her back," he admits, acknowledging that he knocked her out. What stayed with him, however, was the depth of her combativeness. "She's just waking up, and she's swinging! That's the first thing that comes to her mind!"
At the heart of their heroin addiction was an unspoken deal. If Robbie couldn't "get the hustle up" for drugs or money, Pamela would. It's hard to see the fighter or the hustler in Pamela now. Her 35-year-old exhausted body looks punched in. When she was in state prison the first time, in 1988 for petty theft, Pamela was in the mix, but now, she's avoiding the fun, which means avoiding trouble. She is doing what she calls straight cell time now -- reading historical romance novels, spending whole days in bed. Like an estimated 3 percent of California's female prisoners, Pamela is H.I.V.-positive.
"This is sad, but before I got busted I told Robbie, 'We need a prison break,' " she says. "You didn't have to worry about bills, you didn't have to worry about getting up, finding drugs, you didn't have to worry about kids getting dressed for school. Now I regret saying that."
Pamela believes she's in prison not because she stole 20 to 30 pairs of Levis a day for heroin, setting them in the stroller with her daughter and pushing them out of the store, but because of the impact her drug-using life style has had on her five children, ranging in age from 5 to 18. When they weren't with Pamela's father, who was raising them, they accompanied her when she went out to steal.
Sears was the easiest, according to her daughter Regina, 18, who is in the maximum-security Colorado Women's Correctional Facility, serving a three-year term for second-degree assault and attempted escape. (She had been placed in juvenile detention for stealing another girl's coat. After stealing the coat, Regina says, she pushed the girl through a window.) Regina and her 16-year-old brother, Jason, were lookouts for their mother. If they helped Pamela steal, they each received a cut. Before the cut was money, it was candy.
Shoplifting remains Jason's happiest memory of his mother. He tells me this from the Contra Costa County Juvenile Detention Center in California, where he's being held, for the second time, for stealing cars. "When I heard she was going to die, when I heard she had H.I.V., you know what I thought?" says Jason, a wired boy with a shaved head and skinny body that give the impression of a drumstick. "I thought, man, me and my mom had a hell of a lot of fun. She would steal pants and stuff, boost pants. And she would always give me a pair, off the top. And my mom just would be laughing. We pulled that one off, you know, I started crying when I thought of that."
Jessica, 13, inherited the role of lookout when her older siblings took to the streets. "Mom," Jessica would say, exhilarated, "they're on us. Dump!" It made Jessica giddy to save her mother. "It was a cat-and-mouse game for her, too," Pamela says. "It was our way of life." In the same way Pamela made adjustments for the presence of violence in her world, her children's priorities about Pamela realigned. Pamela was their mom. Having her steal and shoot up was better than seeing her heroin-sick.
Regina, Pamela's most apparent heir, dreaded her mother's frequent arrests. She had to feed her little sisters and get them off to school. She also had to deal with Robbie, whose $100-a-day heroin habit had shriveled to twice a month because his veins were so overused. He would cry, then get drunk. "He slaved me," says Regina. "He wouldn't even let me go to school sometimes. He made me stay home and clean and cook." Robbie denies this. Pamela says, "He kind of wanted her to do all my things."
Above her lower bunk in her eight-woman cell in C-yard, Pamela has pasted Regina's prison artwork. Unicorns leap at eye level next to the thin pillow where Pamela rests her head. She believes that her daughter, with all the gang-banging and glue-sniffing and chores at home, subconsciously came to need a prison break herself.
Jessica, Pamela's middle child, is a chubby girl with jet-black hair and crumpled lips. She is Pamela's ally and protector. "My mother loves me the best because I've been through everything, and I know how she feels and stuff like that," declares Jessica, the words falling out so quickly that she gulps whole phrases just to catch her breath. Jessica wants to make sure I understand that just because she's not in prison doesn't mean that she's not unhappy.
Jessica and I sit in my rental car beside her grandfather's stucco tract house, near the window where Pamela and Regina must have climbed out when they were about Jessica's age. When Pamela was 15, her father, crouching between the trucks and cars that line his yard, caught her and a 25-year-old boyfriend necking. He struggled with the young man, who then drove away with Pamela. She didn't return until she called her father collect from Dallas almost two years later, beaten up and pregnant with Regina. When Regina began to run away at 12, she only stayed away in spurts. Jason left home at 15. Although he's part Mexican, he identifies himself as a white supremacist. "Jess," he tells his little sister when he calls or passes through, "you deserve a better life than this."
Jessica thinks running away is a bad idea. She wants to be home when her mom returns from prison. On that special day, all happiness begins.
Though Jessica can't know it now, what will happen when Pamela is released is that she will marry a former love the first week. By the second week, she will be drinking, "kicking it" with the old friends she had planned to avoid. At a probation appointment, she'll test positive for heroin, then sign up for methadone treatments, and her husband will land in the county jail. Jason will escape from the juvenile detention center. Pamela will take Jessica's younger sisters back. Regina will get in trouble and land in segregation. Jessica's old hopes will fall down. Right now, she's worried most about the AIDS, how it might make Pamela die no matter what. That's the worst thing. And although Jessica tells her best friend everything -- even admitting that her mother is in prison -- Jessica cannot tell her best friend this.
As the sun sets, Jessica's two younger sisters, ages 5 and 8, chase each other around the car, the thistles, the scrawny trees, the flattened yard. Jessica asks me to put the car light on. Then she adds: "So like, if nobody could help us or anything with our life? They can't help us?" She turns her eyes on me, such sad eyes, their gravity shadowing her chunky cheeks with the nighttime dark. "Can you help a girl like me?'
 
Shirley
 
 IN NOVEMBER OF 1994, WHEN SHE STEPPED INTO the receiving cage at Central California Women's Facility, her doleful eyes cast downward, Shirley Carone was a 24-year-old mother of three, twice divorced, depressed, drinking heavily, using drugs and about to finish the 11 months remaining on a suspended three-year sentence for a grand theft conviction for stealing clothes from a department store. When she was pulled over for speeding in the cab she drove to earn her living, the police ran a license check and discovered an outstanding warrant for probation appointments she missed. The police also discovered methamphetamine in a Marlboro box under her seat.
Shirley had recently discovered she was pregnant by her boyfriend, David Smith, 34. That David, already a father of two, would prove to be loyal through her 10-month incarceration -- and not only take care of their son when he was born but also marry Shirley and visit her four times a week -- makes Shirley's experience an aberration. It was her first state prison term. She had served one year in the county jail for stealing jeans and had also been arrested for soliciting cocaine.
When David visits Shirley at the prison, they may share one brief kiss at the beginning and the end of their time together. Holding hands is allowed. When David leaves, Shirley is strip-searched.
To be searched, an inmate steps out of the prison-issue muumuu and stuffs the uniform in a hole on the search-cell door where a handle should be. Then she spreads her legs while a female officer slides a mirror on the end of a long instrument, like an oversize spatula, on the floor. The inmate squats over it and coughs. She also opens her mouth, runs her finger along her gums and under her breasts and through her pubic hair. She folds back her ears and wiggles her toes. Then she bends over, as if to touch her toes, and spreads her buttocks and coughs again. Shirley appreciates it when an officer doesn't stare. Some of the officers stare.
David tries not to think about what's happening to Shirley because he can't harness the intrusion of other explosive thoughts that the strip search brings to mind -- strangers frisking the body that holds his baby when Shirley heads to work exchange, being able to watch Shirley dress and shower, having the right to read his mail. David's frustration is worsened by the shame he feels at being unemployed. He has always worked -- two jobs, three -- and now here he is, relocated to be near Shirley, about to go on welfare and, effectively, be the mother to their son.
If an infant born in custody is not collected by a family member within 48 hours, the baby becomes a dependent of the juvenile court. After David Sr. collected David Jr., he booked a tiny, long-term room at the B&Z Motel in nearby Madera. How did Shirley find a man so unlike her first two husbands, guys who, according to Shirley, beat her and stalked her? "Purely by accident," she says.
Shirley met David at a Walmart store in Palmdale, Calif., at a strip mall on the Mojave Desert an hour and a half northeast of Los Angeles. His was the cab dispatched to pick her up, and he pulled up two hours late. She cussed him out, apologized and did not give him a tip. The next day, her housemate called a cab, and once more it was David, with his long hair and tentative smile, which Shirley later discovered was because he was embarrassed by his teeth. The housemate invited David in to share a line of methamphetamine. "And I just sat there the whole time staring at him," says Shirley. "I was attracted to him, but. . . ."
Shirley needed a cab the next day to visit her drug connection. She requested David. "He pulled up real fast," she says proudly. She asked if she could stay in the cab and drive awhile because she hates to be alone. They drove all night.
On his calendar at the B&Z, David has drawn a circle around the date Shirley is scheduled for parole. Beside it, he has placed a question mark, which speaks to the worry at the forefront of his anxious mind: Shirley, free. Might she lose her good-time days? Take the risk of going to the main yard, where she could end up in a fight? Will a bureaucratic error create some unforeseeable delay?
At 6 feet 2 inches, David overwhelms the small motel room, and it's an airless room already, swallowed by the baby's crib and a lumpy bed. David Jr. props up in his father's arm like an overstuffed grocery bag, his sprocket of hair grazing the ceiling, yellow-stained from smoke. It's spooky -- his baby blank eyes, how someone so little makes so little sound. But the freight train screams as it blasts by the B&Z what seems like every hour. And there's the rattling of the air cooler and buzzing flies and car doors slamming, the children of other B&Z residents slapping empty beer cans on dry dirt.
On the wall is a perfectly positioned lineup of the visiting-room Polaroids of the Smiths, although, because Shirley and David married in prison, Shirley has to keep her maiden name for identification purposes. Only four more strip searches until his wife is released. David's keeping count.
"You weren't kidding when you said it was small!" says Shirley on the sunny day of freedom when she steps into the dim motel room, bumping right into the bed.
"You think this is small," says David, "you should have seen the last space." He moved into this slightly larger room in preparation for her release, scouring it down and setting it up during his sleepless nights -- the floor is bright, the tub has been scrubbed, he has changed the linen. The cooler's filled with Pepsi, Shirley's favorite drink.
David bends down awkwardly to hug Shirley, who sits smoking on the bed. He mock commands, "No contact with the inmate!" -- it's a joke -- and Shirley rolls her eyes. Her weariness is beginning to show the slightest edge of disappointment, on its way to what looks like an unrelated, titanic contempt or rage. David Jr. crams a stuffed animal in his gooey mouth and David Sr. moves to intercept it.
"He seems happy, let him play," says Shirley.
"You're going to tear the whole end of it off," David says to his son.
"I can always sew it," Shirley says.
"Not if he swallows ----."
"Give it to him," snaps Shirley, irritably, surveying the room with a sniffy air. "Well," she says, to no one, sighing. "I'm used to living in small, confined spaces." David Jr. lets out a howl.
 "THINGS ARE REALLY STARTING TO COME into place," Shirley reports over the phone one month later from the two-bedroom apartment where she and David now live. Unlike the 95 percent of parolees who return to the communities they came from, Shirley moved to Madera, one town over from Chowchilla, away from her drug-using friends and ex-husbands, where she and David had a wobbly but at least fresh start. David works at whatever he can find -- stocking inventory at a warehouse, packing cardboard boxes, putting rubber rings on pipes -- riding to jobs on a bicycle donated by the church ladies Shirley met through her prison Bible study group.
"We haven't peaked yet or anything," David says. "We're still getting furniture, that kind of thing, but we are making it." David worries that the work will dry up. Shirley worries about the time alone. She fills it up watching soap operas and her son. "And I don't even like soap operas," she says.
She thinks of the prison as a sort of distant parent who, in its unclear way, forced her to grow. "I used to want so many things for myself, I wanted so much, I wanted -- I just wanted," Shirley says. "And now I don't care if I ever get the things in life that I want, as long as I have my family there."
Still, she wishes she had a friend her own age. It's hard to make friends David will approve of, and although the ladies from the church are sweet, they are rather old. When Shirley feels she's going crazy with the isolation, "cooped up, as if I was in lock-down," she heads to Walmart. The two-mile trip can take up to four hours on the Dial-a-Ride, which schedules rides based on demand. She and the roly-poly David Jr. stroll up the chock-full aisles, down them, looking at all the brand-new things. "I think I know the inventory there now," Shirley says, with a whispery laugh. But the presence of the objects are a comfort, and the other women make her feel less alone.

HEADLINE: Exploring a Red Rock World

BYLINE: By IRA HENRY FREEMAN; IRA HENRY FREEMAN is a former reporter for The Times who writes frequently on travel.

 BODY:
SNUGGLED in central Arizona's Verde Valley, between scorching deserts to the south and high, snowy mountains to the north, Sedona's weather-sculptured, red sandstone buttes and spires attract three million tourists a year. Winters are mild, and the 4,500-foot altitude tempers summer heat.
Local residents boast that their Mogollon Ridge location, surrounded by huge national and state forests, is second in natural wonder and majesty only to the Grand Canyon of the Colorado River, two hours' drive to the north. A local saying has it, "God made the Grand Canyon but He lives in Sedona." And Hollywood has spread the gospel by showing the red rocks as a backdrop in more than 65 Western films. 
 When Sedonans mention the Coffee Pot, the Elephant, the Cathedral or the Coxcomb, they are talking about favorite red rocks towering 1,000 feet above the town. During our two-week stay early last year, my wife, Beatrice, and I learned to recognize these and lesser formations, like Snoopy, lying flat on his back gazing at the wide blue sky.
We had enrolled in a five-day course for older adults, one of 14 given in Sedona last year by Northern Arizona University under the auspices of Elderhostel, the nonprofit organization that sponsors inexpensive, short-term academic programs at 1,900 institutions in 49 countries around the world. The only prerequisite is that a participant be at least 55 years old, or be traveling with a spouse who is 55. At $355 (now $365) for five days' lodging, meals, tours and instruction, it was a most economical way to see the spectacular scenery and Indian ruins of the region. And the Elderhostel orientation made it possible for us to make the most of the following nine days, when we toured on our own in a rented car.
Our Elderhostel group of 42 was registered on a Sunday afternoon in large, bright double rooms with private baths and televisions at a modern motel well back from busy Highway 89A, the Railroad Inn (since renamed the Red Canyon Inn).
At the orientation meeting in the hotel's conference room that evening, we met our fellow hostelers, mostly retired professionals -- academics, lawyers, engineers. Some were first-timers like Beatrice and me, others "graduates" of up to 31 different Elderhostel programs throughout the world.
The next morning, we braved the early morning chill for the oatmeal, scrambled eggs and potatoes at Bernie's New York Restaurant adjoining our motel. (The restaurant has since closed, replaced by Emilio's, which serves Continental fare.)
All our meals, except a sack lunch on our all-day field trip, were provided at set hours -- breakfast at 7 A.M., lunch at 11:45, dinner at 5 P.M. -- chosen so as not to interfere with the regular clientele. The food was plain, nourishing and well cooked. Jessica Margulies, our young, efficient field coordinator, always had a table of fresh fruit and hot drinks in the conference room for us.
Each day experts from the university presented lively lectures on the origin of the earliest Indian settlers, white pioneer history, geology and ecology of the region, plants and animals present and extinct. We learned that the tall rocks are red from iron pyrite and hematite in the soil, and the horizontal gray layers striping them are limestone deposited in an inland sea three million years ago.
One evening, Ken Mikell entertained us with cowboy music and poetry. On another Christy Van Cleve brought in a flapping hawk, a falcon and a screech owl -- all of which she would soon release -- that she had healed of injuries in her bird hospital.
On our first afternoon most of us took an optional trolley-car tour of Sedona. On the narrow valley floor, we followed Highways 89A and 179, lined with shops, restaurants and art galleries in low, pink, adobe-style buildings. We paused at Tlaquepaque (tlahkay-PAH-kay) -- a Mexican-style enclave of patios and fountains with art galleries, cantinas and boutiques -- and stopped at the severely modern Chapel of the Holy Cross, built right into a cliffside.
The following afternoon, a comfortable university bus took us to Tuzigoot National Monument, the ruins of a two-story pueblo built by Sinagua Indians between 1125 and 1400 A.D. A paved path constructed by the Parks Department made it easier for us to reach the site, 120 feet above the valley floor, than it had been for the original inhabitants. A ranger, Jose Castillo, led us over the remains of the 77 rooms and inside a restoration of a typical apartment. In the visitors center he showed us ancient artifacts found nearby. Outside, he identified edible plants the Sinagua had depended on.
The bus took us on to Jerome, a rich copper mining settlement until 1953, when the ore ran out and it became a ghost town. Now resurrected as a quaint resort and artists' colony, it has a jumble of frame houses on stilts clinging to the sheer side of Mingus Mountain at 5,435 feet above sea level, with magnificent views of the Verde Valley.
We climbed the steep streets to art galleries and shops selling jewelry, antiques and pottery. We visited the Victorian mansion of Rawhide Jimmy Douglas, one of the early owners of the mine, and saw the old ore carts and other mining equipment in the museum. The town is named for another owner, Eugene Jerome, cousin of Jenny Jerome, Winston Churchill's mother.
I took advantage of a free afternoon on Wednesday to join three of my classmates on a two-hour Pink Jeep Tour, which costs $50 and took us lurching and jolting over boulders, through streams, cactuses and chaparral and up and down near-vertical rock faces. The jeep climbed up a red rock the size and shape of a submarine and brought us to lofty Chicken Point and a panorama of the carmine landscape.
The next morning, Bill Cowan, a fountain of local knowledge, cowboy poetry and anecdotes, led a day tour. Our first stop, Montezuma Well, a limestone sinkhole 470 feet in diameter and 55 feet deep, is still fed by freshwater springs. Mr. Cowan pointed out the remains of ancient Indian dwellings and canals they had built to irrigate their crops.
Eleven miles away, we followed a paved path to Montezuma Castle, an 800-year-old, five-story, 20-room Sinagua "apartment house" recessed in the sheer cliff, 100 feet above Beaver Creek. Entering the ruins is prohibited, but we could see them clearly from the self-guiding trail below. At the base of the cliff, near the creek that supplied water for the settlement, we had a close view of Castle A, a once imposing 45-room dwelling. In the Visitors' Center were artifacts of the original settlers, stone axes, hammers, pottery, baskets, bone awls and needles. The castle and well, misnamed by Spanish explorers, have no connection with the 16th-century Aztec emperor.
Fortified by a picnic of well-filled sandwiches, fruit and gingerbread on the creek bank, we headed for Oak Creek Canyon, then drove along it for 16 miles on a serpentine, alpine road amid majestic pines of the Coconino National Forest. In the sunlight, the canyon walls glistened carmine, purple, orange and saffron above the deep green forest floor. At Oak Creek Vista, 6,300 feet high, we trudged across the previous week's snow to gaze down at the torrential stream 1,000 feet below. Near our parked bus, we were able to buy handmade jewelry that Navajo women displayed on mats on the ground. The turquoise necklace Beatrice bought for $18 would have cost much more at a shop in town.
When the Elderhostel group dispersed at the end of the five-day course, Beatrice and I rented a car for touring farther afield on our own. The next morning, with reservations in hand, we drove to the depot of the Verde Valley Railroad in Clarkdale 20 miles away. We wound slowly for 38 miles through roadless wilderness along the Verde River, on tracks laid in 1882 for shipping copper ore. The four-hour excursions are so popular that reservations are a must.
Over loudspeakers in each of the six comfortable coaches and on open cars covered with awnings in between, a guide pointed out bald eagles soaring above, herons at the river's edge, and the remains of copper mines and cattle ranches. In pauses, Ken Mikell sang and played cowboy ballads on guitar and harmonica. Lunch sandwiches were available in a deli car in coach. There was also a bar coach selling beer and wine coolers and an extra-fare Pullman car.
On Sunday, we drove six miles on the scenic Boynton Canyon Road to the isolated, 70-acre Enchantment Resort for its recommended Sunday champagne brunch. On the majestic red butte facing us, hikers were following an old Indian trail to cave dwellings where petroglyphs can still be seen. Later in the week, we lunched at Sedona's rival luxury resort, L'Auberge de Sedona, on 11 acres, tucked in a canyon alongside Oak Creek. The sunny dining room gave us a view of the creek made lively by the recent snows.
There were other vistas to see: Schnebly Hill Scenic Drive, Red Rock State Park and the popular swimming hole at Slide Rock State Park (though it was too cold to test the stone slide leading into it).
We took a two-day trip to Flagstaff, a university town and ski resort in the snow-covered San Francisco Peaks, 28 miles to the north. There we spent a rewarding morning in the Museum of Northern Arizona with its fine collection of Southwestern Indian pottery, weaving, painting and carving, as well as anthropological and natural history exhibits, including a dinosaur skeleton found in the area.
After a night in one of Flagstaff's Victorian bed-and-breakfasts, the Birch Tree Inn, we drove 15 miles farther north to Sunset Crater Volcano, where we hiked through fields of hardened lava laid down 900 years ago. Farther on, we reached the Wupatki National Monument, Indian ruins where a mysterious blowhole sends up steam from deep in the earth. From the top of the cliff, we could see with our binoculars a colorful stretch of Painted Desert far beyond.
Back in Sedona, after browsing through some of the numerous art galleries and shops, we visited one of the area's four major "vortexes," on the rocky mesa below the airport. Said to be energy fields emanating from the earth, the vortexes are supposed to energize or calm those who can tap into them.
Since the vortex was unmarked, we were not sure we had reached the proper spot. However, the young woman who had directed us said that her previous day's visit had so energized her that she had been unable to sleep that night. Whether it was the energy field or the crisp, dry mountain air and sunshine, we did indeed feel exhilarated by our time among the red rocks.

HEADLINE: On Broadway and Off, a Seesaw Season

BYLINE: By PETER MARKS 

 BODY:
TONIGHT'S TONY AWARDS, TO BE broadcast at 9 on CBS, signal the end of the 1995-96 Broadway theater season, one that seemed to elicit as many opinions as this year's Tony nominations. Recently, the New York Times critics Vincent Canby, Ben Brantley and Margo Jefferson traded impressions about the season on Broadway and beyond. The moderator was Peter Marks, the Times's theater reporter.
Peter Marks: Any overall thoughts about how good, how bad artistically this season has been? What stands out about how it progressed? 
 Vincent Canby: One thing is that at the end, the season looked awfully good. But when you go back and look to see what happened earlier, it was still a pretty lean time.
Ben Brantley: Do you think so? I was sort of encouraged by what I saw in the fall. It was nice to see "The Tempest" on Broadway and the Laurence Fishburne "Riff Raff," the first production at Circle Rep. It looked like there were going to be little glimmers of hope.
Margo Jefferson: "Riff Raff" wasn't a great play, but the dialogue was alive.
Canby: The season wound up so well that we were just awash in good productions, serious productions.
Brantley: At the end, absolutely.
Canby: Until then, though, it wasn't all that lively.
Brantley: Well, we cover different beats. I actually was kind of encouraged.
Canby: Of the straight plays on Broadway, there were about five that were exciting. The fact that they were even done is remarkable.
Brantley: Yes it is. But no one's going to see them. I find it incredibly disheartening.
Jefferson: They're not doing as well as they should, given their reviews and their quality.
Marks: That's an interesting issue. You've got all this quality, and suddenly everything is at the half-price TKTS booth. What's going on? Why aren't they selling tickets at the box office to all these things?
Jefferson: Because the people who were keeping box offices going were apparently rushing to buy "Victor/Victoria" tickets.
Brantley: Frankly, I think that the idea of the critic, the academically trained critic, or the critic who has come through the education system of America as it once was, is obsolete.
Marks: Meaning that nobody cares what a critic says?
Brantley: The thrills that people are seeking, they're going to ferret out for themselves. We're basically in a Victorian age again, where people are absolutely infatuated with technology. And it's kind of clumsy technology. You see it used in musicals now. I feel like I'm watching an early silent movie.
Canby: There is a place for that kind of thing.
Brantley: There's a place for it, but can't it be better? Vincent, you've written very eloquently about the sound problems. When I saw "The King and I," I couldn't tell what voice was coming from where. That's a small house, and the sound is better there than at most places. But I'd seen "A Delicate Balance" that afternoon -- heard real voices coming at me and wonderful language spoken that was particular to the character. With musicals, there often might just as well be automatons up there.
Jefferson: Maybe we're at that point in the way cultures and art forms move. It just can't carry it. I still feel -- I know I said this screamingly about musicals -- the theater is busy now doing what big volcano movies were doing. It doesn't cut it for me. What I've been shocked by, though, is the range of lively, intelligent, not even academic, people who will say to me, "Gee, I don't go to the theater. Why should I? It's dead." They're not ashamed. They're not uncomfortable.
Canby: Theater has gotten itself into a very peculiar corner. It's for the economically elite. It costs a lot of money. But the people who might enjoy real theater don't go. Those who can afford it see "The Phantom of the Opera" or "Les Miz."
Jefferson: Or can't, like young audiences. I have all these students, graduate students, people in their teens and 20's, at Columbia. They can't go. Three of my students paid more than they could to sit in the back row of "Bring In da Noise, Bring In da Funk," which they were dying to see. They're the audience.
Marks: I'm a little confused. I thought that "Rent" and "Noise/Funk" are on Broadway because the critics basically demanded that they come to Broadway.
Jefferson: We can help make a difference to Off and Off Off Broadway productions.
Marks: There is something to be said for critics who champion certain shows.
Jefferson: It does seem as if most of the shows we're praising were conceived in the minds of Off Broadway people.
Brantley: Or regional theater.
Jefferson: Exactly. Or "A Delicate Balance" is on Broadway because "Three Tall Women" did so well Off Broadway. It's also the Signature Theater doing Edward Albee a few years ago.
Brantley: That was crucial.
Jefferson: "Buried Child" is from Steppenwolf in Chicago. "Noise/Funk" is from the Public Theater. "Rent" is from New York Theater Workshop. August Wilson traveled all over first with "Seven Guitars."
 
 
 
Hits vs. Flops: The Prevailing Mind-Set
 Marks: Should Broadway become a stop on the road? Should Broadway not be worrying about whether it's presenting new things? Or should it just be putting on the best stuff from everywhere? I'm still trying to isolate why we're getting this burst. "A Delicate Balance," "Buried Child" "An Ideal Husband, "Rent," "Noise/Funk" -- they're all here now.
Jefferson: A lot of the playwrights we're talking about -- August Wilson, Sam Shepard; and also Caryl Churchill and Adrienne Kennedy -- prove that we should invest our time, our attention, our money in them long term. It's a life plan, as with an O'Neill or a Tennessee Williams. Theatergoers should see "Seven Guitars," for example, without having to think, "Can I afford $65 for a play that Vincent and Margo and various other people point out will be disappointing in the second half?"
Canby: I often feel a little bit inhibited, getting into that sort of thing. "Seven Guitars" is something I'd love everybody to see, and I'm sure they would love it. They would get into it. Should we point out the problems in the second act in detail or brush over it? I don't think it's worth it to criticize it too much if we're going to keep people away.
Marks: Because a play is so fragile, from an audience's point of view, they'll turn off if you point out too many flaws?
Canby: They have no time for the show that receives a mixed review. People want to see the hit and stay away from the flop. They don't respond to mixed reviews. The fact is that the reader is now just interested in a thumb up or thumb down from the critic. And that's no way to criticize theater.
Brantley: The problem is that to get people into the theater you do have to cheerlead. It's a shame that we can't all read a little more temperately, but we're in such a hard-sell universe.
 
 
 
To Cheerlead or Not, That Is a Question
 Marks: Here's a perfect example. Margo and Ben, you both pulled back on "Rent" after liking it very much. Margo, the headline on your review was " 'Rent' Is Brilliant and Messy All at Once" when it was Off Broadway. Then when it moved to Broadway you did three paragraphs on it. You basically were saying you weren't very impressed with the move. Then you fairly strongly pointed out once again the problems that it had had Off Broadway.
Brantley: Which I had said the first time.
Marks: Here's a show that everyone, even the Tony nominators, seems to feel reflects the future. In light of what you just said about this sort of conflict in the role of the critic, do you feel that it was
Brantley: But in a sense, you could afford to be unsparing about "Rent" at that point.
Canby: You mean it was good enough to withstand any kind of
Brantley: No, I mean it was presold. But also I think it is good enough. And I said how much I loved it. But I wasn't going to go into the same ecstasies I went through the first time when it's the same virtues and the same flaws being represented and yet asking to be judged by different standards.
Jefferson: It was deliberate on my part for similar reasons. I thought, good Lord, they really do have it made now. They've been advertising this move. They need to live up to the promise. And I was irritated. I thought maybe this is just carelessness, but it's a carelessness that can, in that transition from Off Broadway to Broadway, look cynical. I'm not saying they were.
Canby: I felt the same way about "Seven Guitars." I thought it was just super in Chicago and was swept away by it. Then it comes to New York, fixed so-called, and it's not as good.
 
 
 
The Pleasurable Shock Of the Unexpected
 Marks: What surprised you this season, what performances, what plays? Off Broadway? On Broadway?
Canby: Frank Langella surprised me in "The Father."
Marks: Why?
Canby: I just had not thought that much of him as an actor; he's a very adequate actor, a good actor. But to see him in Strindberg was an amazement for me.
Brantley: I thought Patrick Stewart also gave a good performance in "The Tempest." And Philip Bosco I have great admiration for but not in "Moon Over Buffalo."
Marks: So Langella was a surprise?
Jefferson: The performance was a pleasure, and there was a depth. Also, in the midst of a terrible production, but a really untainted performance.
Marks: What else?
Jefferson: The Encores! series at City Center has been terrific -- for example, Melissa Errico in "One Touch of Venus." And then Ann Duquesnay in "Noise/Funk." Two wonderful musical-theater resources, were there a musical theater for them.
Marks: I know you very much liked "The Model Apartment" by Donald Margulies Off Broadway.
Brantley: I loved it. It was so extraordinary. It's a subject -- the Holocaust -- that could, of course, be investigated endlessly, but it's really a very threadbare subject at this point too. It showed a playwright, who had been developing in interesting ways for many years, at the height of his powers.
Jefferson: I agree.
Brantley: In the dailies I was the only one who liked it. That was probably when I stopped worrying about what other critics said.
Canby: What did you think of Jon Robin Baitz's "Fair Country."
Jefferson: He's very intelligent, and there's real emotional fervor there. But I thought the potential, the depth that was already stirred up, wandered off in the second act and got dissipated. But, like "Seven Guitars," that's a play that's worth mounting again.
Brantley: He's also an example of the "Rent" syndrome himself, Jon Robin Baitz, because expectations have been so high about him.
Canby: There was a problem, it seemed to me, with "A Fair Country" in that here's a play that should be a play, and he's sort of influenced by the freedom that films offer. It seemed to me the play loses its impact with all that comparatively cumbersome scene-changing. I don't like to sit through long blackouts.
Brantley: That's an interesting observation. I noticed it in "The Skriker" at the Public Theater, these attempts to emulate cinematic techniques, to address an audience that is conditioned to thinking in those ways -- as Gertrude Stein prophesized in the 1920's was going to happen. And curiously I think it works in smaller theaters better.
Marks: You had a lot of performances this season by veteran actors and actresses. Did anybody stand out?
Jefferson: Probably Uta Hagen in "Mrs. Klein" came the closest.
Brantley: That really is a case of this, you assume, inflated reputation, the teacher of so many actors. And so you kind of say, "Go on and show me." I don't like the play. I'd seen it before, and I have serious problems with it. And I was sitting there with my mouth open with admiration through most of it.
Canby: It's terrific when that happens. The first five minutes of "Hello, Dolly!" just had me in the aisle. I couldn't believe it.
Brantley: In the year of the superdiva there was also a new breed of matinee idol.
Marks: Like?
Brantley: Adam Pascal in "Rent," who really has improved, I think, and who holds the stage wonderfully; Savion Glover. It's another generation -- even Lou Diamond Phillips, with the shirt sliding off his shoulders and just exuding youthful energy. There are going to be little girls lined up backstage with their autograph books.
Jefferson: Apparently there already are.
Canby: How about some of the new directors? Like Scott Elliott.
Marks: He's been crowned king of the young new directors.
Canby: I saw his "Curtains" recently. Amazing.
Marks: What has he got? What is it?
Brantley: I think it's true in "Curtains" to some extent as it was in "The Monogamist": the production was better than the play, but it didn't make any difference. You realize what's great about theater is that it doesn't exist just on the page. It's the intersection of the director's vision and the writer's vision and the actor's vision that really makes it fly.
Canby: His handling of that rather large cast
Brantley: He's wonderful with ensembles. Also, I think he combines a director's sense of the overall vision without ever being reductionist, without being, say -- excuse me -- JoAnne Akalaitis or Anne Bogart, who use the actors as figures in a scheme, as figures on the chess board. He has such a respect for the individual performance and for the actor finding that fabled emotional center. And he nearly always does, even in something like "The Monogamist," when the lines didn't really seem to warrant it.
Jefferson: What other directors? There's so much tame directing in New York.
Canby: How about Gerald Gutierrez? He's a director who's always been sort of accepted, and he does good stuff. "A Delicate Balance" points to something more.
Brantley: I agree. I think it's a turning point. He has what Cherry Jones has as an actor. There's a respect for the material and an intelligence, and at the same time there's an ability to popularize it -- and I don't mean this in any denigrating way -- without vulgarizing it to make it accessible, to find that little hook to get the audience in.
Jefferson: Ditto George Wolfe, obviously with "The Tempest" and "Noise/Funk."
Brantley: George Wolfe was made for Broadway.
 
 
 
The Hippest Audiences Are at the Fringes
 Marks: The Off Broadway institutional theaters this year did not -- aside from "Rent" and "Noise/Funk" -- really light up. I mean Playwrights Horizons, the Manhattan Theater Club, the Public Theater, Circle Rep, with the exception of "Riff Raff," the Roundabout, the Mitzi Newhouse at Lincoln Center.
Brantley: Yes, the established institutional theaters have been less interesting. Where you find it and also where you find the hippest, best-looking crowds are on the margins now, the $15 houses. Forever the Wooster Group, which has become so sort of institutional chic. But even if you go to something like Arden Party or the Adobe Theater, even Ensemble Studio Theater, that's where you find actors seeing actors or hipsters seeing hipsters.
Jefferson: And then there are those little spaces where performance art and theater overlap -- Dixon Place, Dance Theater Workshop, P.S. 122. That's another thing I wanted to say. I want these performers to keep doing their own work. But take Everett Quinton, at the level of total, wonderful pro; then take some of these younger people I keep seeing in these downtown spaces: like Marga Gomez at the Public; David Cale, who is now in "Curtains," and he's so good; or the young guy at Dixon Place -- Phillip Brown. These are all performers who are developing, or already have, a wonderful collection of skills that are somewhere between what we used to call legitimate theater and fabulous vaudeville. They can do their solo performance seasons the rest of their lives. I'd like to see a place for them in mainstream theater too. More performers like that could be used in shows like the revival of "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum."
Brantley: With "The Tempest," George Wolfe did incorporate, not marginal figures exactly, but less obvious
Jefferson: I'm thinking about a seasoned man of the theater, like Everett Quinton, or a very young performer. I'd like to see directors working with them on Broadway, Off Broadway, whatever.
Brantley: The assimilation of younger talent is happening by degrees. It can take many forms. It can be a Scott Wise, who was so wonderful in "State Fair," where you realize he's keeping that particular tradition alive. Or Melissa Errico. There we're talking about continuing a convention that should be kept alive, that people can do it expertly and bring new blood into it.
Marks: How deep does this go? Are there two or three people that come to mind, or are there 10 or 12?
Jefferson: I could name more: Dael Orlandersmith. James Lecesne. Danny Hoch.
Canby: Where would they go? If they're successful, they'll wind up in sitcoms.
Jefferson: That's the problem. If they're willing to have careers -- to risk careers -- Cherry Jones is now very successful.
Brantley: Yes, but let's stop for a moment to sing a paean to Cherry Jones, who is not going to budge from the stage and the bicycle-to-the-theater and so forth.
Jefferson: Well, how about all those really good New York and regional theater actors in the Manhattan Theater Club revival of "Blue Window." Let them have their television shows, their appearances, their movies. But let them have a real life using their skills in this range of roles Off Broadway and, when it's appropriate, on Broadway.
Marks: What about disappointments? What everyone thought would be a crowd-pleaser -- the Royal Shakespeare Company's "Midsummer Night's Dream" -- didn't make much of a splash. While Cheek by Jowl's "Duchess of Malfi" at BAM did.
Jefferson: Let's not forget about that as a pleasure for the year. I loved it.
Brantley: That may have been the high point. It made me think about something I thought I knew very well in totally different terms. I wanted "A Midsummer Night's Dream" to do that and it didn't.
Jefferson: We talk about George Wolfe and Scott Elliott having courage -- the courage of esthetic and social conviction. It was the same with "The Duchess of Malfi." I don't care if I disagree with them; I want to be made to sit up in my seat.

When the Olympics Were About an Ideal

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR 

 BODY:
IN 1991, HBO SPORTS SURPRISED worshipers of baseball with "When It Was a Game," a documentary lovingly composed from 8- and 16-millimeter home movies that had been made by players and fans from the 1930's to 1960. Suddenly, a sport whose golden age had barely been preserved in black-and-white was endowed with a delightful hour of Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig and Jackie Robinson in Kodak color, swinging bats, running bases, playing pepper and posing like relatives at a backyard barbecue.
On Tuesday night at 10:15, HBO will return to the home-movie formula with "Spirit of the Games," which, like "When It Was a Game," was made by Steve Stern and George Roy. The new film recalls an era of the Summer Olympics when athletes were truly amateurs, when a men's basketball final was played on a rain-soaked dirt court and sprinters hammered their own wooden starting blocks into place at the line. 
 "What sticks with you is the oneness of humankind," Olga Fikotova, who won a gold medal for Czechoslovakia in the discus throw in 1956, says in the film. It is difficult to imagine a 1996 Olympian in Atlanta, clad in togs supplied by a corporate sponsor, articulating a sentiment like that. Or like one expressed by Mae Faggs, an American who won a gold medal on a relay team after arriving in Helsinki, Finland, in 1952 with $7.50 in her pocket: "There is no such thing as who won the Olympics."
Ross Greenburg, the executive producer of HBO Sports, who oversees the cable network's sports documentaries, admits to a purpose that is partly nostalgic. "We want to put people in a time capsule," he said. "We like to go back to simpler times."
Over the last several years, HBO Sports has developed films that contrast sharply with most other HBO documentaries, which tend to be about troubling contemporary issues (a recent example is "Priestly Sins: Sex and the Church"). HBO Sports leaves such issues to "Real Sports," its quarterly magazine program; last month, for example, it examined the death of the boxer Jimmy Garcia. "I don't think of us as muckrakers," said Seth Abraham, president of Time Warner Sports, the parent company of HBO Sports, referring to the sports documentaries. "We tell stories about people."
In addition to baseball of yore, subjects of HBO Sports films have included Sonny Liston, sports in the 1960's, the American Football League and Arthur Ashe.
A commitment to producing documentaries in the first place sets the people at HBO Sports apart from their broadcasting rivals, who are generally loath to veer from the standard fare of games. ABC Sports has been a recent exception, producing "A Passion to Play," a continuing series of films about women in sports.
HBO Sports spends an average of $750,000 to produce a documentary, and each generally takes a year to complete. "It's not economical for networks to produce sports documentaries," Mr. Abraham said. "They don't bring in good ratings. Ergo no ad dollars. Ergo they're not necessary. That affords us a tremendous window."
The window was flung wide open by "When It Was a Game," which won a Peabody Award. "Before that," said Mr. Greenburg, "we'd just string clips together and try to make rhyme or reason out of events."
Although HBO Sports documentaries often make use of standard archives, the preference now is to track down rare scenes. "Spirit of the Games" does not provide the sort of official, broad-scope Olympic experience seen in the films of Bud Greenspan, who has been documenting the Olympics for decades.
"Bud's films are encyclopedic; ours is a scrapbook, a slice of life," Mr. Stern said.
The good-natured approach of "Spirit of the Games" was determined largely by the quality of 75 hours of home movies collected by Mr. Roy and Mr. Stern. They tracked down rare film in a variety of ways: examining ship manifests, finding an amateur cameraman's name through a Milwaukee funeral home and communicating extensively with the German Railroads Information Office.
Culling usable film from amateur movies can be a tedious task. "The hardest part is to find what stories will match the film you've got," Mr. Stern said recently in the cluttered Manhattan office of Black Canyon Productions, the company he owns with Mr. Roy. "It's not easy to fall back on images. We have to tell better stories."
That task was especially necessary with "Spirit of the Games." Baseball is so familiar to most Americans that despite the amateur quality of much of the film in "When It Was a Game," many of the players were easily recognized. Not so the old Olympians, save perhaps for the great sprinter Jesse Owens, whose four gold medals in the 1936 Summer Games in Berlin blocked Hitler's effort to make that Olympics a showcase for Aryan superiority.
" 'When It Was a Game' was more about emotional memory," Mr. Stern said. " 'Spirit' is about telling stories."
Those tales are propelled by the home movies and complemented by simple narration, majestic music and off-screen interviews with athletes like Bob Mathias, the 1948 and 1952 decathlon winner; Harold Connolly, a 1956 javelin gold medalist, and Pat McCormick, a 1952 and 1956 gold medalist in diving.
Film of the pole vaulter Bob Richards led him to recall the stiffness of the equipment in the 1950's. Shots of the 1936 men's basketball final -- the one on the muddy court -- reminded a member of the American team, Frank Lubin, that "we were a poor little bunch of players out there."
The producers of "Spirit of the Games" were limited not only by the film that they discovered but also by the habits of those who had operated the cameras, said Mr. Roy, who edited the film. To make his point, he froze on a black-and-white image from the 1936 Berlin Games that showed Mr. Owens talking to a long-jump rival. The man who made the film, Mr. Roy said, shot in color in other parts of Europe but only in black-and-white in Berlin. "Why?" he continued. "Imagine Owens in color."
MR. ROY ALSO LAMENTED the itinerary of Holstein De Haven Fox. Fox, a Philadelphia stockbroker who in 1936 was traveling on his honeymoon aboard the liner Manhattan, made 16-millimeter film of the United States Olympic team as it used the ship's deck as a temporary gymnasium. "It's the oldest color film of the Olympics," Mr. Roy said. Yet Mr. Fox and his bride left the boat in Ireland and did not venture to Berlin. "If the guy had gone on to Berlin," he said, "we'd have had some great film."
There were moments of archival nirvana, however: just a few weeks ago, the producers received color film of the Nazi flags that dominated the streets of Berlin in 1936. "It makes Marty Glickman's words so much better," Mr. Roy said, referring to the renowned sportscaster, who believes that he was removed from an American relay team in 1936 because he was Jewish. When Mr. Glickman says "Nazi," he literally spits the word out.
The next HBO Sports film will be about sports movies, with Sylvester Stallone as host. "Some of our documentaries will be popcornish; some will be serious," said Mr. Abraham.
Mr. Greenburg's wish list includes a film about Joe DiMaggio. "No one has figured him out yet," he said. And so far, no trove of home movies has been discovered to help explain the puzzle of the Yankee Clipper.

Riot Grrrl Returns, With a Slightly Softer Roar

BYLINE: By Evelyn McDonnell; Evelyn McDonnell, music editor at The Village Voice, is co-editor of "Rock She Wrote: Women Write About Rock, Pop and Rap."

 BODY:
AT THE HEART OF FEMINISM lies the belief in self-determination: women should define their own identities. One recent expression of that tenet can be found on "Call the Doctor," the new album by Sleater-Kinney, a band of three college-age women from the Pacific Northwest. "It's fine/ When it's all mine/ It's on my wall it's in my head/ Memorize it till I'm dead," Corin Tucker, a guitarist and vocalist, sings with an air of calm assurance on the song "I Wanna Be Your Joey Ramone."
That calm is quickly disrupted. "It's yours/ Now I'm so bored," Ms. Tucker sings, then breaks into a series of spine-tapping "yeah, yo" 's -- part hiccup, part howl -- that punctuate the chorus: "I wanna be your Joey Ramone/ Pictures of me on your bedroom door/ Invite you back after the show/ I'm the queen of rock-and-roll." 
 Judging from the rapt attention paid by teen-age girls at Sleater-Kinney's recent New York shows, Ms. Tucker and her bandmates are already becoming their generation's Ramones. Providing more female role models was one of the objectives of the feminist rock movement called Riot Grrrl, according to manifestoes from the fanzines that circulated in punk circles in the early 90's. When the mainstream press discovered those fanzines about a year later, Riot Grrrl (a term coined by young punks in Washington and Olympia, Wash.) became big news for media outlets from The L.A. Weekly to "Nightline." Unprepared for the attention, and disturbed that their effort to define themselves was being undermined, Riot Grrrls called for a news media ban.
But Riot Grrrl had already inspired major-label interest in "angry women rockers" and entered the critical lexicon, becoming a catchall phrase for female performers from Courtney Love -- who attacked the Riot Grrrl movement in a song -- to Alanis Morissette. Meanwhile, the original core of artists and activists has splintered and sometimes disappeared. Important bands -- Bratmobile, Heavens to Betsy, Huggy Bear -- have broken up. Even Bikini Kill, the movement's best-known group, has distanced itself from the term. Some early proponents now see it as a symbol of women's failure to take control of their lives.
Yet a flurry of recent releases from performers once associated with the Riot Grrrl movement show that artistically, at least, it was not a passing fad. The struggle for self-expression and autonomy is the driving force behind powerful new records by Sleater-Kinney, Bikini Kill, Team Dresch, Tribe 8 and Mecca Normal.
The title track of Bikini Kill's album, "Reject All American," explains why the band disdains the sort of media attention most groups would die for. "Mass acceptance/ Overrated," Kathleen Hanna sings as part of a sarcastic litany of "all American" values that will earn her an executive positionin an apocryphal company she calls "Nothing Incorporated." While Ms. Morissette turned female angst into big pop and big bucks, independence for artists like Bikini Kill means, in part, freedom from media conglomerates that they see as peddlers of sexual stereotypes. All of these bands depict corporate culture as dehumanizing and scary. All record for small labels. Team Dresch and Sleater-Kinney both record for labels owned by women, thus fulfilling the Riot Grrrl goal of economic self-sufficiency.
These post-Grrrl bands also present more startling images and radical music than the long-haired folk singer look and radio-friendly grooves of Ms. Morissette and Joan Osborne. The tattooed, pink-haired, topless Tribe 8 resemble comic book warriors, while Mecca Normal plays experimental punk behind growled abstract poetry. Instead of complaining about wayward boyfriends, bands like Team Dresch and Tribe 8 who describe themselves as "queer punks" sing about the complexities of women's relationships to each other.
This focus on identity has provoked a backlash against girl bands by people more interested in music than politics. In some ways it has backfired against the artists' own intentions as well, as critics have ignored their music while scrutinizing their ideologies. These are rock groups, after all, not special-interest groups.
WHILE THEIR production values won't land them in the top 40, Bikini Kill and Sleater-Kinney's records, in particular, vault out of the punk ghetto with irresistible melodies, aggressive guitars and singing with expressive range and power. Ms. Tucker of Sleater-Kinney (which took its name from a road in Lacey, Wash.) has a sharp, rich voice that vibrates with yearning and defiance. The band's chief asset may actually be its guitar work: Carrie Brownstein's staccato riffs lead Ms. Tucker's distorted chords in a dizzying call and response.
Sleater-Kinney's desire to be rock-and-roll heroes is refreshing; Riot Grrrl's rejection of the mass media at times smacks of college-girl elitism and stereotypically female fear of success. Yet the goal of these artists is not to make the stage a place of envy but to make it one of inspiration -- to create a music that empowers rather than alienates. Feminism and punk are united by the credo of "do it yourself." Jean Smith of Mecca Normal expresses this in rejecting the burdens of being a role model when she sings, "Write your own damn anthem -- run it up the flagpole."

Can New Urbanism Find Room for the Old?

BYLINE: By Herbert Muschamp 

 BODY:
THE CONGRESS FOR THE NEW Urbanism is the most important phenomenon to emerge in American architecture in the post-Cold War era. As the only organized nationwide movement of consequence initiated by baby-boom architects, the new urbanists challenge the conventional view that members of this individualistic generation are incapable of collective action.
But the organization is now at a crossroads. Founded in 1993, it has devoted itself single-mindedly to promoting suburban developments like Seaside, Fla., the "neotraditional" resort planned in the 1980's by Andres Duany and Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk, two founders of the new urbanism. Last month, however, the group took a major step toward expanding its agenda to include saving America's aging central cities. Convening in Charleston, S.C., the new urbanists signed a charter that began by opposing "disinvestment" in the central cities by banks and business interests and went on to affirm "the restoration of existing urban centers and towns." 
 This shift in part reflects major changes in leadership of the congress. Charleston was the final conference organized by the founding members. In the past year, the group has added new board members with a demonstrated commitment to revitalizing the central city. The shift also reflects the desire of many of the organization's 1,600 members to live up to its name. The question now facing the membership is whether its admirable solidarity can survive this important enlargement of its scope.
Founded by Mr. Duany and Ms. Plater-Zyberk, Peter Calthorpe, Elizabeth Moule and Stefanos Polyzoides and Dan Solomon, the Congress for the New Urbanism started out with an appealingly simple idea. Persuade builders to model new suburban developments on the compact scale of small towns. Increase the density of residential development. Place shops, schools and recreation within walking distance of houses. Orient plans toward pedestrians and public transportation. Design guidelines that draw on traditional ways to humanize and animate the street: porches, stoops, balconies.
Although the new urbanists have been brutally dismissive of the modern movement, the congress was in fact modeled after the Congres International de l'Architecture Moderne, which was primarily responsible for creating modernism's solidarity. Many architects outside the new urbanist organization are offended by this appropriation. How dare the Congress for the New Urbanism claim the legacy of a movement for which they have only contempt?
But in a crucial respect, they've earned the right to make that claim. Like the modernist congress, the new urbanists are concerned with the pragmatics of building. Le Corbusier, the modernist organization's leading guru, designed as his personal symbol a device he called "The Open Hand." An upraised palm, with fingers spread, the image stood for humanity's mastery of tools. And the Congress for the New Urbanism has been nothing less than masterly in its use of the tools available to architects today. The schools; the news media; elected officials; public policy makers: the Congress for the New Urbanism has cemented working relationships with virtually every sector that affects the art and business of building.
Boomer architects often complain that their profession has been marginalized, but clearly that is not true of architects associated with the Congress for the New Urbanism. According to the organization, more than a hundred developments nationwide designed by affiliated architects have been completed or are now under way.
But the new urbanists emulate the modernist congress in less agreeable ways as well. Like the modernists, the new urbanists rely too much on esthetic solutions to the social problems created by urban sprawl. For instance, the urbanist group inflates the ecological advantages of its plans. True, a compact development that reduces dependence on the car could be less environmentally damaging than a sprawling subdivision. On the other hand, compact developments could simply make room for even more compact developments. Many environmentalists believe that the soundest way to reconfigure suburban development is to increase the density of existing postwar suburbs. The newer, third-ring suburbs tend to regard undeveloped land in much the same way that modernists saw the city: as a blank slate for their visions.
The Congress for the New Urbanism also oversells the capacity of its designs to foster a strong sense of community. Clearly if you increase density, you bring people into closer physical proximity. But as life in any city makes painfully clear, it is by no means certain that proximity guarantees social cohesion or even social contact. It's not only lawns and driveways that atomize suburban life. The economic exclusivity of the suburbs is being turned against its own progeny as a new generation grows up in affluent neighborhoods with the gnawing suspicion that they won't be rich enough to live in them. (It is another argument for "retrofitting" older suburbs with varied housing types.)
Modern architects created machine-age images of "rational" cities that, when actually built, often functioned miserably. The new urbanists may be producing architecture for the Prozac age: Potemkin villages for dysfunctional families.
Curiously, the most socially far-reaching discussion at the Charleston conference was provoked by an esthetic issue. A skirmish broke out over the attempt to include in the charter a phrase that appeared to slight architects who "mimic historic forms." Like the charter's embrace of the central city, the phrase represented a departure from the "neotraditional" esthetic actively promoted by the Congress for the New Urbanism. Clearly intended as a response to critics who consider this a reactionary esthetic, the phrase so irked the keynote speaker, Leon Krier, the architect and adviser to the Prince of Wales, that he refused to sign the document.
The dispute involved more than style. The phrase recognized that it is laughable to talk of urbanism without an appreciation of the city's diversity and its historic role as the matrix of experiment and innovation. And the argument over its inclusion helped clarify an important point: tradition is not history. It is a mythology, a belief that, in a world of accelerating change, not everything solid must melt into air.
Myth-making is a perfectly legitimate function of architecture, of course, and the Congress for the New Urbanism has performed this function with notable success. Mythology aside, however, the new urbanism is also part of history, and what was most disturbing about the Charleston conference was the group's limited grasp of the history of suburban culture.
THROUGHOUT THE WEEKEND, I kept thinking back to "World War II and the American Dream," a superlative show presented last year at the National Building Museum in Washington. Organized by Donald Albrecht, the show traced the origins of postwar suburbia to the armaments industry developed during World War II. Just as the war helped lift the United States out of the Depression, so the prosperity of the postwar years was sustained by converting the armaments industry into a machine for mass-producing suburbia. Cars and highways, steel and asphalt, concrete and oil: suburbia was the continuation of World War II by other means. But its chief casualty was the central city. The modern movement's destructive impact on the urban center pales beside the erosion created by suburban development.
The architects of the new urbanism are, for the most part, the children of that development. And they have put together a powerful organization that could help reverse its impact. It would be heartening to think that the group will pursue the new direction taken by its charter. Otherwise, the "new urbanism" could turn out to be little more than another assault on the old.

HEADLINE: Connecticut Q&A: Aris Crist;
Can Buildings Harmonize With Nature?

BYLINE: By BOBBI P. MARKOWITZ 

 BODY:
GOOD architecture has always been based on providing good environments, both inside and outside. These days, the terms "green" and "sustainable" architecture are interchangeable for a quiet revolution worldwide that is defined as improving the quality of living and working environments without diminishing the earth for future generations.
Aris Crist, an architect in Greenwich who earned a bachelor's degree with a concentration in environmental science from the University of Vermont and a master's in architecture from Syracuse University, is a proponent of the green way. 
 In a recent interview, Mr. Crist elaborated on the reasons for its growth. Following are some excerpts from that discussion.
Q. What are the elements of green or sustainable architecture?
A. Essentially, green architecture is based on a heightened awareness of conserving natural resources. It employs strategies for energy-efficient designs, improving energy performance. It deals with indoor air quality issues, the use of sustainable wood products, the thoughtful selection of materials and recycled products as well as the conscientious recycling of construction waste.
Q. How old is the movement?
A. While good architects have been incorporating and building with regard toward nature for thousands of years, there's been a growing effort since the 70's when a new awareness about pollution became acknowledged. The movement in the past has been about identifying the problems, but the next step is to spread the word, to gather and disseminate information.
Q. How have we created the problem?
A. We have been frivolous and wasteful with our natural resources. We act as if we have all the trees in the world to cut down and fossil fuels to burn. We forget that the byproduct of our rapid, unplanned and overdeveloped high-technology building industry is a tremendous amount of pollution.
Toxic materials, from P.C.B.'s to lead to asbestos, are polluting our earth, potentially making us sick. We've forgotten about the oil crisis that just took place a short 20 years ago. We lack long-term vision.
We can learn from the Europeans. Energy has always been a precious and expensive commodity in Europe so they've been conserving more for a longer time. If we don't educate ourselves, what will we be leaving for the next generation?
Q. What can we do to reverse the "use it up" mentality?
A. We need to create a proper balance between a building and its byproducts. Then we can enter a sustainable equilibrium.
Conserving energy is among the primary elements to consider. We use building procedures and techniques that are concerned with keeping the house properly insulated and ventilated so that the energy used inside stays there.
Solar energy, for example, can be gathered in an active way to collect heat and produce electricity. Passively, we can try to place a house in an orientation to face and gather sunlight in the winter and use shading techniques in the summer to keep the heat out. We place windows to achieve maximum warmth and cooling ventilation.
Natural lighting is another source of energy savings. If you use insulated glass to brighten dim rooms, you'll cut down on electrical use. Most new buildings can use daylight to meet up to 50 percent of their lighting needs. For nighttime use, there are new low-voltage disconnect sensors which sense when people leave a room and automatically turn off lights -- another energy saver.
Q. Can you give some examples of resource conservation and material recycling and selection?
A. We need to select materials that have lower energy usage to produce. By buying local products, we cut down on transportation costs and through the utilization of recycling material, people can conserve half of our natural resources right off the bat. When renovating, we like to use as much of the existing structure as possible. We can use gypsum wallboard that is made of recycled paper. We can use engineered wood products that are made up of smaller pieces of recycled wood to create beams and joists. This way we use 80 percent of the tree rather than select solid timbers.
Q. How does the issue of indoor air quality correlate with the term "sick-building syndrome"?
A. We've been putting a lot of toxic materials in the buildings where we work and live. We've created a lot of health problems -- headaches, dizziness, nausea, loss of appetite and fatigue.
When furnishing the inside of our spaces, we should select natural products instead of ones that are laden with toxic glues, formaldehyde and adhesives. Tacking carpet down rather than gluing is less harmful. We can use paints that are much less detrimental to the ozone layer. There are new ventilation systems that recycle the heat or cooling energy at the same time fresh air is mixed in.
Q. How can you incorporate sustainable design into your practice?
A. I recently completed the design for a shore-front estate, an opportunity to build in harmony with nature. We tried to minimize disturbing the land. We considered environmental issues with respect to the sun, wind and natural features which positively affected the performance of the building. To take advantage of the spectacular view and site, a lot of glass was needed. I selected Super Glass which was the highest rated insulated glass at the time. Because of the dramatic high ceilings, an in-floor heating system was used to provide warmth and comfort in the space that people occupy.
While it is not always possible to position a house on a site that will enhance the ability to conserve energy, there are many creative things that can be done on any site. We use tile and solid masonry products to capture and store the heat for later use. Wherever possible, I suggest over-insulating, as a very easy way to reduce energy usage and cost.
Q. What are some examples of using green in the public domain?
A. The Audubon headquarters in New York City, an environmental renovation versus the construction of a new building. In Washington, D.C., "The Greening of the White House" brought together a group of architects to do a design study that recommended how the White House could be brought up to current standards of energy conservation and incorporated the use of recycled materials.
Q. How is the movement developing?
A. Presently, there is a systematic approach to bring a diverse group of people together -- not only architects but policy makers, universities, professionals, manufacturers and end users -- to form a collaboration that could start to address our problems. There are environmental symposiums, which further the movement by trying to reduce the negative impact we have made on the planet. Lastly and most importantly we need to educate our children.
Q. Is sustainable architecture a costly proposition?
A. Our objectives are first and foremost to create healthy working and living environments in our homes and offices. While constructing energy-efficient buildings may be somewhat costlier now, we need to show that incorporating sustainability can be done economically, with long-term benefits. By educating people, we can create more demand for the products so that the prices become more competitive. A great part of our objective is to develop a whole new industry, both service and in manufacturing, which will create new jobs, new businesses and new products, which will afford us new possibilities.
Q. How can sustainable design influence our future?
A. We want people to continue to prosper but at the same time we want to reduce the negative impact. The more pollution we make, more money and energy will be wasted on fighting pollution. The more trees we cut down, the less forests we'll have left. The more erosion we create, the less land will be left. There are many solutions to sustainable design issues, we just have to embrace them. We want the future generations to regain a harmonious and balanced relationship with the earth.

HEADLINE: Beauty That's More Than a Gorgeous Coat

BYLINE: By ROBIN F. DeMATTIA 

 BODY:
HAIR spray, blow dryers, combs, brushes and ribbons will be out in full force next Sunday when contestants vie to catch the judge's eye and go home with the top prize. The gathering of beauties is not, however, the latest take-off on the Miss America Pageant; it is the largest dog show in Connecticut. Almost 2,000 dogs -- starting at 8 A.M. in the Aero Center, part of the Pratt Whitney complex in East Hartford -- will be strutting their stuff for the judges, their owners, their handlers and the audience.
"A good show dog is a happy dog who stands up and says 'Here I am, look at me,' " said Ingela Gram of West Redding, a dog breeder for 23 years. She is one of many owners participating in the 64th annual Longshore-Southport Kennel Club show, sanctioned by the American Kennel Club. The event, which is open free to the public, is an opportunity for people who are considering purchasing a dog to see many varieties, learn about grooming requirements, and observe different temperaments. 
 "We'll see a number of breeds that are not large in A.K.C. registration but representative of a breed that is catching on," said Howard Falberg of Weston, president of the club. "The Chinese shar-pei was hot 10 years ago. Now we see the Cavalier King Charles because it's an appealing little dog with a nice personality and it's easy to care for."
Mr. Falberg said a large number of golden retrievers, Labradors and spaniels would also be in competition.
There are 15 all-breed kennel clubs and 36 specialty clubs in Connecticut, which together held 30 dog shows last year. Nationwide 1,245 all-breed and 2,375 events were held in 1995 by the country's 770 all-breed and 1,900 specialty clubs. The American Kennel Club -- which registers dogs, licenses shows, and is involved with genetic research for breeding purposes -- recognizes 140 breeds. Currently the five most popular dogs are Labrador, Rottweiler, German shepherd, golden retriever and beagle.
Mr. Falberg explained that dog shows started in a way similar to agricultural county fairs, where people who bred livestock brought them to competition. "In part," Mr. Falberg said, "the dog show of today does the same thing. There's a standard for every breed and judges judge not only the dogs that day but against what the A.K.C. standard says."
Each breed competes in five classes: puppy, novice, bred by exhibitor, American-bred and open. The best male and best female then compete, with the winner moving on to the next stage. Here, seven groups compete (including sporting, hound, working and toy), for the best in show. Other awards are given among the breeds as well.
The goal for most owners is to have their dog earn enough points at shows to become a champion; the dog then becomes valuable for breeding purposes. But for many people, simply having a pleasant day with their dog is enough.
"These dogs are first and foremost pets," said Dennis Sprung, vice president of show events for the A.K.C. "They are the same dog that sleeps with your child, retrieves your ball, and greets you when you come home." Mr. Sprung said dog showing is a family sport that teaches children fair play and competitiveness.
Ingela Gram's daughter Karin Gram, now 26, started helping her mother when she was 13. It was Karin who showed an interest in the Cavalier King Charles spaniels. "It's not too big and not too small, and we thought they were pretty," Karin Gram said, adding that very few Cavaliers were in competition in her native Norway when she starting showing them, giving her a good chance to win.
Neither Ingela Gram nor her daughter had experience in breeding or showing dogs, but that didn't stop them from raising many champions. "You learn piece by piece, through other dog people, and through your own mistakes," said the mother. "I read a lot, and I had a friend who was a veterinarian."
The Grams found a challenge when they started working with Maltese. Ingela Gram had gone to a dog show to buy a Pekingese, but was quickly attracted to the small, long-haired Maltese. "I saw these white things and I didn't know what they were but I wanted one immediately," Ms. Gram said. The winner of the day, a dog called Brancliff Snow Prince, was "the most gorgeous dog I had ever seen," she recalled.
Now showing their fifth-generation of Maltese, the Grams have become accustomed to the high-maintenance routine of these toy dogs. Ingela Gram spends a minimum of two hours each day grooming her dogs. The Maltese she owns that are still in competition must keep their long hair safely tied up in dozens of paper rollers. The wrappers of each dog are tied with different color rubber bands - Keepie is in pink, Boris in purple, Plutt in black, and Chou-Chou in green. For visitors, it's an easy way to tell the dogs apart.
The dogs are bathed weekly with special conditioners, their hair combed daily. Lest this sound like a lot of bother for the dogs, consider their environment their spacious kennel boasts a small refrigerator, a dishwasher, a large sink for bathing, and its own washer and dryer. It's heated in the winter, air-conditioned in the summer, and a radio plays music for the dogs every afternoon. When it's raining, the dogs can go outside to a three-sided, covered run. In good weather they roam through an expansive, flower-filled backyard.
Like many breeders, the Grams don't keep all their dogs at their home. Instead, dog owners hire handlers to board their dogs, groom them, and take them to shows. This can be expensive. Ingela Gram explained that entry fees at shows (she enters dogs in about 50 a year) run $20 to $25; a handler's fee is about $55 a show, board is $10 to $20 a day, and there are food and veterinary bills. "To make money you don't show dogs," Ingela Gram said, "you breed a lot, or you're a handler."
With so many people participating in dog shows each year, the American Kennel Club commissioned an economic impact study early last year. The results showed that each exhibitor spends an average of $67 a day while at a show; a two-day dog show with 2,000 participants contributes $268,000 to a community, according to Mr. Sprung.
That figure doesn't include travel expenses, and many owners will drive or fly throughout the country to attend shows. "Many times people say 'I know this judge and I think he might like my dog,' so they travel to get those points," said Mr. Falberg, who has served as a judge. "There are people who say judging is political, but I can only answer about how I act and the vast majority of judges I know: We're judging the dog, not the handler or the owner."
Mr. Falberg adds that the same judge can look at a dog differently at another show, too. "You can have the same dogs in competition, and one day a dog will show himself with a certain spark or have a special attitude. They are like you and me, sometimes we're really terrific and other days we're not as peppy."
Regardless of how Mr. Falberg's own dogs -- golden retrievers and a basset hound -- perform, he said he enjoys their company. "I get as much pleasure walking them through the woods and sitting with them watching television as I do taking them to dog shows and seeing them do well."
The hardest part of breeding, then, may be letting go of the litter. "I think when puppies are about 6 weeks old and I can play with them is the best time," said Ingela Gram, who currently has six Cavalier King Charles spaniel pups about that age. Picking a dog or two to keep is difficult, she said, because there is no guarantee they will grow up to be champions. She bought a Shetland sheepdog two years ago when it was 8 weeks old, but he grew too large to become a show dog. In addition to their size, the dogs must also develop the right physical structure (head, teeth, feet, and bones), maintain a proper weight and coat condition, have a temperament that is neither too shy nor too viscous, and have a good gait all attributes a judge considers.
After deciding which puppies to keep, breeders then look for a good home for the rest. Few dogs go to other breeders. "To buy someone else's dog is to admit your competitor has better dogs," Karin Gram said.
Most puppies sell for $500 to $1,500 Mr. Falberg said and added that "ethical breeders are very concerned about where their puppies go." "They interview people beforehand and do their best to see that a dog will be part of the family."
Mr. Sprung advises buyers to visit the dog's home and evaluate its environment before purchasing. "See the dog's parents and litter mates, and be sure of their temperament and health," Mr. Sprung said.
If the dog shows signs of becoming a champion, Mr. Sprung encourages owners to get involved in showing. "I would welcome them to the sport, and assure them their dog will do its share of winning, and its share of losing," he said. "But I would ask them to take the time to gain an education and experience, so they are truly familiar with the standard of the breed. Become a responsible dog owner and the reward will be many felt over the years."
The Longshore-Southport Kennel Club show is open next Sunday from 8 A.M. to 5 P.M. There is a $3 parking fee at the Aero Center. For more information about the show, call 227-5324. The American Kennel Club Breeder Referral Representative Hotline may be called at 900-407-7877 (calls cost 99 cents a minute).

HEADLINE: Two Studios With One Goal: Perfection

BYLINE: By FRANCES CHAMBERLAIN 

 BODY:
TOSHIO ODATE left Japan nearly 40 years ago, but traditional Japanese culture is still very much part of his life.
His studio, on a winding road in Woodbury, is divided into two sections. One is a large barn-like structure with chunks of wood and bronze figures lying about; next door is a small, traditional studio with a raised platform, a tatami mat, and rows and rows of Japanese woodworking tools lining the walls. A small shrine, leftover from the New Year celebration, shows that it is a meditative place. 
 Since Mr. Odate came to the United States in 1948, he has earned an international reputation for the sculptures created in his side-by-side studios. Some are monumental, others are small enough to hang on the wall or sit on a table top.
Mr. Odate's early training as a cabinetmaker came less as a matter of choice and more because of the circumstances of the time. "It was post-World War II and there was a food shortage in Japan. Going to work didn't pay much, but if I became an apprentice I knew the customers would feed the craftsman. My parents weren't thinking about my future; they were thinking about my survival."
Once the economic issues were resolved, young Toshio finished high school and started college. During college one of his professors put him in touch with the designer Russell Wright and urged him to go to the United States for one year. He spent a year in the United States, a year in Denmark to learn more about Scandinavian design, and then returned to the United States, a course of action that was unprecedented.
"At that time, no young man could go out of Japan. I was only allowed to take out $500," he said. "My destiny was all set. Everyone wanted me to come back and be a teacher. But when I saw Greenwich Village, met all the creative people, the optimism, I threw everything out. I had studied industrial design, and now I was studying art," Mr. Odate said. "It was the most exciting period of my life. I knew I didn't want to just go back to Japan, be a professor, and die."
As a sculptor in New York, Mr. Odate filled his apartment with objects. He knew he had to move out and get a lot more space to work in.
"If art is the philosophy of life, then artists should see the good and bad, the pit of the city," he said. "But when you're older, you need a place to create freely, without interruption."
He was teaching at Cooper Union, so he took a compass, and with that school in the center, considered anything within a two-hour commute. He arrived in Woodbury in 1973, ready to leave New York behind.
After his stint at Cooper Union, Mr. Odate taught for 16 years at Brooklyn Museum Art School, gave courses at Purchase College in Westchester County, and is currently an instructor in sculpture, Japanese toy making, Japanese tool sharpening and Japanese screen making at Brookfield Craft Center in Connecticut, and an associate professor of sculpture at Pratt in Brooklyn, N.Y.
Although teaching paid the bills, Mr. Odate's sculpture made his reputation. He began showing at the Stephen Radich Gallery in New York in 1962, and has had frequent one-man shows since then. His work has been in the Guggenheim, the Whitney, the Museum of Modern Art, the Pratt Institute and the World Trade Center in New York as well as in the National Museum of Modern Art in Japan, and the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford, the Mattatuck Museum in Waterbury, and the Kent School in Kent.
His guest lectures and publications are also extensive, and sometimes the source for new work.
In Dusseldorf and in Coburg, Germany, part of a traveling lecture tour, he said he really began to look at German architecture and think about how to incorporate it into his work.
The result is a series of handmade churches and temples, some standing five feet tall, with intricate cabinetry, windows, working clocks and bronze votives inside.
Votives are popular in many cultures, Mr. Odate said. "They are objects representing wishes, and often having to do with something that is wrong with the body," he explained. "Americans are Puritanical. They use candles instead of objects. But in Japan, for instance, you may have a child who cries at bath time, so the parents buy a little wooden plaque with a smiling child in the tub. They buy it and pray that the child will like bath time."
Mr. Odate's newest sculptures include a Baroque church from Germany, a Gothic church, a Greek temple, a Japanese temple, and every bronze votive will be almost life-size -- a proud, strong statement, Mr. Odate explains.
"This work is for all humans, all cut by hand, all sanded by hand. I want to show the young student, who has technology, what human nuance is," he said. "Corner to corner, I put my hand on these pieces. Human vibration is the byproduct."
Preceding the votive series was Mr. Odate's "Shobu Project," a testimonial to the raising of his son. He pieced a quilt from baby clothes, built intricate cabinetry to display every pair of sneakers the child had owned from infancy to high school graduation, and other constructions. Before that, several years were occupied with a series called "Peace Work."
"There was a restlessness because of pink slips, family problems. We were supposed to be in peacetime, but it's still very unsettled," he said. "This work was against restlessness, because nobody had peace of mind. My highest skill was used to make a simple box representing the pride of humans.
"We can't change being organic beings," he said. "Like vitamin pills, we should every day contact organic material. Linen, cotton, silk, grass and wood are like relatives for us," he said. "Do you send someone condolences by E-mail or go hug them? Technology should be used by humans. Humans should control technology. We are drifted by the current of technology now and that will make so many miserable people."
His job today, Mr. Odate says, is to make everything possible by hand. "I have to enrich things with human nuance," he added. "Computers are the next generation's job."
In his work, his life, he finds himself reverting to old ways. "Somehow, I still live like the Japanese. I have an old fashioned wood stove, which isn't so different from what I knew there.
"I often cook on this stove, and similar to my using the traditional tools, it is holding onto roots and beautiful childhood memories."

HEADLINE: Southampton Historical Museum Is Setting a Spirited Agenda

BYLINE: By RAMIN P. JALESHGARI 

 BODY:
A WALK through the Southampton Historical Museum is like a walk through grandmother's attic. It is a treasure-trove of memorabilia: There are 19th-century ship's logs, antique toys, period clothing, dishware, furniture, books, African slave and American Indian artifacts packed into every corner and cranny.
In its current state it is little more than a nostalgic hodgepodge. 
 Soon that will all change. The group that administers the museum complex, the Southampton Colonial Society, has an agenda for a series of new exhibits, expanded conservation and cataloguing of the museum's large collections.
"Our museums are well-known throughout Long Island for their extensive collections," said Adele Cramer the museum's first hired curator. "In fact, there are crates and crates of exhibit material in storage that haven't been open for years. We're actively examining that material for presentation to the public."
Also on the agenda is a push toward exploring the multicultural history of Southampton Village -- heretofore most famous for being the first English settlement in New York State. While the museums have always displayed curios from diverse communities, there has been little active inquiry into the contribution of distinct ethnic groups in the region. But that, too, is changing.
"In the last year we've incorporated craft demonstrations by Native Americans from the nearby Shinnecock Reservation," Ms. Cramer said, "and we've given more attention to individuals like Pyrrhus Concer, a slave-born ship steerer who was among the first Americans whalers to travel to Japan."
Practical considerations are high on the society's list as well. Updated office equipment like a computer, fax and copy machine are sorely needed -- today the society's most modern device is an answering machine. Few of the historic buildings have proper heating systems so they could be opened in winter months. Others in the group's care, including the three-century-old Halsey homestead, are in bad need of repairs.
This sudden flurry of activity at the close-to 100-year-old Colonial Society is based on hard economic reality. There is a need to rigorously promote the all important in-flow of visitor dollars to Southampton year-round, not just in the summer months.
"We believe that the local history itself can provide year-round allure," Ms. Cramer said. "By offering a new schedule of educational programs, special events, and access to our extensive museum complex we can draw tourism -- a major source of revenue for the area -- into Southampton during the off-season."
The village is not alone in its belief that history draws tourism. There are 240 regularly visited historic sites on Long Island. The trend extends nationally as well: the National Park Service lists 37 national historic parks and 72 national historic sites with a combined visitor population of 35 million a year.
The Southampton group has financed its efforts through the usual annual appeals and grant acquisitions, but wants to diversify the potential of its assets as well.
The historical museum grounds will be available for rent to small private parties like weddings and receptions and other group dinners. The complex includes a mid-19th century home and other period buildings designed in the fashion of a century-old village street.
This year the society's first major fund-raiser took place on May 4: a cocktail reception and high stakes raffle at Savanna's restaurant. Hamilton Hoge and Howard Gittis, the restaurant's owners, were hosts.
Mr. Hoge went pointed out that, as a local resident, he has seen a certain amount of economic hardship in Southampton during the winter months,
"Many of the jobs here are tourist dependent and when the season closes many average residents suffer," he said. "I've seen 16-year-olds who haven't eaten in three days on line at the foodbank. And its not just Southampton, the entire East End struggles to maintain the local economy in the off-season."
Robert Lipper, president of Island Metro Publications, an agency that publishes Long Island tourist guides, feels that the Colonial Society's objectives of using history tourism to promote the Southampton economy is a viable one.
"The East End of Long Island, of which Southampton, is a part draws most of its tourists from the tristate area, most within 1 1/2 to 2 hours driving distance," he said. "Because of this, worthwhile year-round programs would very likely draw visitors out on weekends. This, coupled with active promotion efforts by groups like the Convention and Visitors Bureau, should make the Hampton a potential year-round tourist destination."
Andrea Gurvitz, director of Communications for the Long Island Convention and Visitors Bureau, said, "The Colonial Society's goals are in keeping with those of groups like the South Fork Promotion Committee, which tries to rouse interest in the East End."
Ms. Gurvitz went on to say that while she supports Southampton's efforts to bring year-round tourism to Long Island, she doesn't agree with local allegations that the area suffers economically in the winter down-time.
"The shoulder season, that is, May and June, September and October, is becoming very popular and East End hotels show 60 percent occupancy," she said. "So, the only actual time with severely reduced tourism to the Hamptons is in the dead of winter -- November to April. Additionally, I haven't seen statistical data pointing to wintertime economic hardship in the area."
Mayor Doug Murtha of Southampton doesn't quite see it that way. "There is no doubt Southampton is primarily a tourist dependent economy," he said. "During the mild winter of 1994, we had people coming out all year, so, weather-permitting, it's possible to draw travelers year-round. 'We must constantly look for ways to capitalize on the visitor trade, thus creating jobs and improving overall quality of life for locals."
The Mayor said that the contributions of organizations like the Colonial Society were a very much needed part of efforts to enhance the community. He pointed to a number of recently achieved measures to keep business in the area, including the refurbishment of a United Artists movie theater on a main village thoroughfare.
"United Artists wanted to tear down the early model theater and build a new multiplex on the highway," he said. "This would have taken business away from the town center. Instead, residents got involved and pushed the theater to reconsider or threatened to raise capital to buy out the landmark building."
Ultimately the corporation restored the old theater's facade and lobby then tore down the old, inefficient auditoriums replacing it with four modern theaters.
This August the village hopes to install antique-style street lamps true to the originals that once stood on the main thoroughfare -- another joint effort between the Mayor's office and local groups.
Southampton also has an Architectural Historical Review Board that a short while ago because a certified government agency. It is one of only six on the Island, and its goals are to promote a consistent building esthetic in the village -- both among historic and newly built sites. This is done by a process where builder's plans must meet certain board criterions.
The board's chairman, William Bates, said he would not answer questions as to whether any local building owners felt they were being pressured to conform to esthetic requirements. Mr. Bates did say that most business and building owners see the board's recommendations and/or restrictions as an effort to promote the good of the entire community.
"The physical appearance of the village is important toward encouraging the tourist and visitor market," he said.
Mayor Murtha did concede that loal residents can get overwhelmed by the already-brisk tourist trade. "I can see how people get frustrated with traffic and parking problems," he said, "Toward August I can see how those working in the service industry might wish it was them out on the beaches instead of continuously behind a counter."
Currently under way is a drive to deter the Long Island Railroad from its plans to close down the current Southampton station in the heart of the village and replace it with a new one east of the site in keeping with both the historic preservation agenda and the need to alleviate traffic problems in the village.
"The station is in a key location, bringing visitors into the thick of village activities," said Mayor Murtha. "It also has historic value: it is one of the oldest stations on the Island. It brought the first beach tourists out here during the turn of the century." The Mayor's office has just begun to negotiate with representatives from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which administers both the Long Island Rail Road and Metro North commuter systems.
Undertakings such as these have, so far, pushed forward Southampton's goals to use living history as an antidote to economic pitfalls in the Shore-community's winter season.
But for some local residents that is not an enticing proposition. Many point out that not everyone has a tourist-dependent job and that there is more to this area than beachfront frolic and celebrity gazing. To them, Southampton is simply home.
"Enough of us in Southampton work outside the visitor industry and live here comfortably," said one woman who asked not to be identified. "I know plenty of people -- like my huband -- that commute to New York or other parts of Long Island for work. Believe me we're not totally downtrodden when the tourists leave -- we're inundated with them all summer long as it is."
Carolyn Fell travels weekly from Nissequogue to visit family in Southampton. "I know tourism industry is needed, but there already seem to be enough of it -- its impossible to find parking, or to walk comfortably down the main street," she said. "That's why I like to go in the fall when its nice and quiet. After all, that's why so many people move out there in the first place."
Debbie O'Conner, a fourth-grade teacher at the Cleary School for the Deaf in Ronkonkoma, one of the first educators to take part in the Colonial Society's new education programs, has praise for the new offerings.
"We went to the demonstration of the building of the Native American wikki-up domicile," she said. "Everything was hands-on and totally authentic. Now that I know Southampton has more to offer than beaches and restaurants, I intend to come back all year-long for other events as well."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/East 42d Street;
Rebirth of West 42d Street Is Spreading Eastward

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
CALL it the creeping glamourization of 42d Street.
First, Bryant Park gets a face lift, and buildings between Fifth Avenue and the Avenue of the Americas start filling up. Then the long-anticipated Times Square revitalization project gets off the ground. Retailers clamor for space on once-decrepit 42d Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues, and Douglas Durst announces plans for a 1.6 million-square-foot office building on Broadway. 
 Now, the glamour effect is rippling east. Brokers report that empty space on East 42d Street is leasing fast. The imminent $200 million refurbishment of Grand Central Terminal, coupled with the Grand Central Partnership's successful efforts to drive taxi hustlers, drug dealers and muggers away from the area, have helped. So has the growing scarcity of good space in glitzier buildings in the East 50's.
But many real estate people say that East 42d Street's new popularity stems as much from what's doing to the west as from changes in the immediate vicinity. They say that what had once been a deleterious identity confusion -- "Potential tenants simply did not know the difference between East and West 42d Street," said Jeffrey S. Cohen, a senior director at Cushman & Wakefield -- is now a major boon. And many guess that the days of address camouflage -- 500 Fifth Avenue and 125 Park Avenue are both, in reality, 42d Street buildings -- are over.
"Owners who used to carefully disassociate themselves from Times Square now talk glowingly about the changes there," said David A. Falk, a senior managing director of Williams Real Estate.
Frank V. Ward, chief operating officer of Hiro Real Estate, which owns the former Mobil Building at 150 East 42d Street, agrees. "What's happening on the West Side is changing everyone's perception of the whole street," he said.
East 42d Street can use all the help it can get. According to RElocate, which tracks building vacancies, about 11.8 percent of midtown space is available; in the Grand Central vicinity -- say, 40th to 48th Streets, Fifth Avenue to the East River -- nearly 15.7 percent of office space needs tenants.
East 42d Street itself is in even worse straits. There, RElocate cites a 20.7 percent availability rate. Nor is architectural panache of much help -- RElocate says that 24 percent of the landmarked Chrysler Building (405 Lexington) is available.
"The problem is, most of the 42d Street buildings are old," said James S. Meiskin, president of the Plymouth Partners brokerage. "You can put on new skins or new systems, but you can't pull the columns out or make the floorplates more efficient."
Nor can you force long-time tenants to stay. Advertising, publishing and other industries that once dominated the area have long since moved their focal points to Midtown South. The few huge corporate tenants are gone, too. Mobil, The Daily News, American Home Products, all have vacated the buildings that bore their names, leaving hundreds of thousands of empty square feet in their wake.
But now, as buildings elsewhere fill up, tenants who shrugged off the Grand Central area are being forced to look at it again.
"Grand Central is the last high quality business district with significant vacancies left," said Robert F. Works, a managing director at LaSalle Partners.
The space is moving fast. A year ago, 30 percent of 110 East 42d Street was available. Today, after a lobby and technical system overhaul, 13.5 percent of its 230,000 square feet is left, and much of that has leases out.
"We'll be down to a 4 percent vacancy soon," predicted David L. Hoffman Jr., a principal of Colliers ABR, who handles the building's leasing.
The Chrysler Building, too, is renting up. Physicians Health Service recently took 18,000 square feet. Mr. Cohen, who handles the building's leasing, says -- although he offers no examples -- that he is seeing many would-be returnees from Midtown South.
"They miss the commuting convenience, and they miss being near the hotels where their out-of-town customers stay," he said.
Mr. Ward says that the Mobil building also is being visited by some of the area's defectors. "They discovered that a 10-block walk isn't easy in the morning," he said.
ACTUALLY, the Mobil building is benefiting from more than disillusionment with Midtown South. Hiro Real Estate, which is owned by the Honzawa family of Tokyo, bought the 1.2 million-square-foot building in 1987, just as Mobil was beginning to move out. By the time the big oil company was gone, the recession had hit.
"Hiro wound up with a vacant building at the worst possible time," Mr. Ward said.
Brokers say Hiro did not help the situation. They say it neither modernized the building, nor made the changes necessary to convert it from single-tenant to multitenant use. They say it did not market the space, took forever to approve deals, and would not cut rents to meet the flagging market.
Even worse, the building sits on land that is owned by Goelet Realty, and the ground lease was due to expire in 2013. Many companies balked at moving into a building whose future seemed so uncertain.
"People worry that a landlord won't put money into a building whose ground lease will expire," said Michael R. Laginestra, an executive managing director of the Edward S. Gordon real estate company.
All that is changing now. Last July Hiro hired Mr. Ward and sent two Japanese executives, sons of the owners, to live in New York, thus speeding the decision-making process. They hired Mr. Laginestra's team to lease the building. They are making capital improvements. And they have extended the ground lease to 2028.
Tenants are responding. FCB/Leber Katz took 175,000 square feet last year. Brokers say that the publishing firm Gruner & Jahr is considering 200,000 square feet. And a shipping company that rejected the building a year ago may take 150,000 square feet.
"The ground lease was a big issue for them," said Mr. Meiskin, the company's broker. "They wanted a 20-year commitment with at least two five-year options."
All told, Mr. Ward says that "serious negotiations" are going on for more than 500,000 square feet, and that the building will soon have just 400,000 square feet left. Mr. Laginestra is even more optimistic: He predicts that the building will be 90 percent leased by this time next year.
Its prospects are certainly helped by the growing scarcity of huge blocks of contiguous space in the area. For a time it seemed that 685 Third Avenue, the 615,000-square-foot former American Home Products headquarters at 43d Street, would provide major competition. Leucadia National, which bought the two-thirds-empty building two years ago, pumped nearly $10 million into refurbishing it, and was expecting to market space early this year.
Instead, it is looking for a company to buy the building for its own use. "An investor won't buy it because you can't get financing for a building that is two-thirds vacant," said Mark Hornstein, a Leucadia vice president. "But for a user that wants to own its headquarters, it makes sense."
Any buyer will most likely come from outside the area. After all, the small service companies that have traditionally been Grand Central's mainstay tenants rarely need a full floor, let alone an entire building.
But, the neighborhood's boosters insist, it is such small companies that will, in aggregate, drive the street's revival.
"This street is dotted with buildings that cater to Mr. Jones from Bronxville, who maybe has a three-person law firm, who loves the convenience, but who didn't sign a new lease until the neighborhood got nicer," said Daniel Biederman, head of the Grand Central Partnership.
MANY leasing agents have set their sights on such tenants. Several, including those at 60 East 42d and 110 East 42d, have been prebuilding vacant space, so that small companies can move in immediately upon signing a lease. They have also successfully wooed larger companies in neighboring buildings that need expansion space.
For example, the big law firm Morgan, Lewis & Bockius, a major tenant at 101 Park Avenue, at 41st Street, has been growing, and just rented 17,000 square feet at 110 East 42d Street to handle its overflow.
Brokers predict that Grand Central Terminal's makeover, combined with West 42d Street's renaissance, will cement East 42d Street's future.
By the end of 1998 the terminal should sport an overhauled ceiling, a couple of new entrances, new restaurants in the concourse, a covered marketplace with fresh produce and meat, and as many as 100 stores, compared with just 40 today.
"The street has much greater future value than current value," Mr. Hoffman said. "It's going to be just one wonderful strip mall, with a Times Square anchor on the West, a U.N. anchor on the east, Bryant Park and Grand Central Terminal in the middle. This is going to be one of the most recognizable addresses in the world."
Actually, it already is. But this time, landlords hope, it will be recognized for something nice.

HEADLINE: Rental-Market Demand Exceeding Supply

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER 

 BODY:
WHEN it comes to summer rentals, the demand is heavy, but the pickings are slim, according to real estate brokers who cover the county from Larchmont to Croton-on-Hudson.
"Years ago we had numerous properties listed for summer rentals," Nancy Neuman, owner of Country Properties in Rye, said. "Although we're still getting many requests, the houses aren't there, even though tenants are willing to pay hefty prices for the summer. One woman I know of is so determined to find something for rent in Westchester for July and August that she finally put her own ad in the paper, to no avail." 
 Other brokers also report a lack of inventory. "We are in an important waterfront community, one that has been a longtime favorite with summer people for over 100 years," said Diane Guarino, manager of the Houlihan/Lawrence office in Larchmont. "This year we have no lack of customers, and the majority are young families who live in the city and want to 'try before they buy into a community.' But their choices are limited, because fewer houses are available this season. I'd advise anyone who is even vaguely thinking about July and August to jump in quickly. There's very little left."
The prices are similar to those of last year, realty agents said. "About the same, $13,000 for two months' summer rental near the Sound in Larchmont and Mamaroneck," Ms. Guarino said, adding that houses with extra features commanded higher prices.
"For instance," she said, "the owners of a five-bedroom with pool and hot tub on Taylors Lane overlooking the Mill Pond in Mamaroneck are asking $15,000 a month," she said.
Despite the doldrums, Ms. Guarino added, the rental business is important to her agency. "Our office, for example, handles a number of properties that were bought during the 80's for investment purposes that are leased out by their owners," she said. "And rentals can and frequently do translate into sales, especially with young customers. We also have a significant number of French nationals in the rental market. They are here on temporary assignments, and they're drawn to Larchmont by the French American School here, and they add to the activity in the rental area."
In Bedford, James B. Renwick, principal of Renwick & Winterling Realty, which his great-grandfather started in 1879, said even though rentals did not generate large dollar volume they were viable because they often led to sales.
This season in the Bedford and Pound Ridge area, Mr. Renwick said, sales have been about par with last year's figures. "But business got off to a slow start," he said. "There wasn't a lot of early traffic, maybe because the winter was so bad."
Houses in the Bedford area on sites of a few acres rent for $10,000 to $12,000 a month. Houses with features like pools and tennis courts rent for more, Mr. Renwick said, "but lawn and pool maintenance are usually included."
"And for the money, the tenant has every right to expect the house to be impeccable," he added. "It should be well equipped with good kitchenware, nice china, glassware and -- I tell my people -- no jelly jars, please."
Two of his customers, the Boyntons, on Bisbee Lane in Bedford Hills, are renting a five-bedroom house with an in-ground pool and pool guesthouse, with nary a jelly jar in sight for $12,000 a month.
"The pool house is ideal for a house guest," Mrs. Boynton said. "It has a large living area, a full, well-equipped kitchen, separate bathroom and two dressing rooms and an outdoor shower.
"The house, which is listed for sale with Mr. Renwick's agency, is being offered for rent for the first time this summer because we have already signed a lease and we are renting a fabulous duplex apartment in a town house in Manhattan. We have lived happily in Bedford for 20 years. But now that our two boys are going to be away at school we feel it's time for a change. And when this apartment came on the market we just snapped it up."
Renwick & Winterling also handles short-term rentals for people with overseas assignments. "Those rentals usually go for about $5,000 a month and usually are for a year or two," Mr. Renwick said. "We also do property management for people who have to be elsewhere for a couple of years and prefer not to rent their houses, but they want to have them looked after."
Croton-on-Hudson has long been a favorite for summer vacationers, said Richard Albert, who has been in the real estate business there since 1948. Mr. Albert recalled that in the early days "we had at least 50 to 75 houses on the books for rent every summer. But with the advent of the jet plane and cheap trips to Europe people went on different types of vacations, and summer renters were fewer." This year his agency, Richard Albert Associates, a Prudential affiliate, has almost no rental listings.
"And the product isn't there just when the demand is strong," Mr. Albert said. "If you can find a rental in Croton it is unbeatable for the money, and the recreational facilities in the community make it terrific. For example, a house with a swimming pool and a tennis court on a nice piece of land in the vicinity of Croton goes for $10,000 for the season, and if you can find it, a four-bedroom house without those amenities will rent for $3,000 to $4,000.
"And Croton is still real country, with the advantage of being only 45 minutes to Manhattan by fast and frequent trains. We have more express train service here than any town in Westchester."
When asked about the scarcity of rental properties, some realty agents faulted the economy.
"Usually by March we have summer-rental listings," said Patricia Bentley, manager of the Houlihan/ Lawrence office in Katonah, which also covers Bedford, Pound Ridge and North Salem. "From anywhere between 25 to 40 properties is the normal amount."
But this spring, Mrs. Bentley continued, "we just didn't get listings."
"People aren't renting their homes," she said, "even though we have prospective tenants ready and willing to pay anywhere from $10,000 a month up to $50,000 a month for the season for something out of the ordinary on four or more acres with a pool and tennis court and four or more bedrooms. It's a strange little rental market, and I find it a bit unsettling."
The economic uncertainties appear to have ripple effects, Mrs. Bentley said, adding:
"I think downsizing or the fear of downsizing has a lot to do with the state of the rental market. Perhaps what's happened is that people have sold their vacation homes and are staying put this summer. It would be interesting to know what's going on in nearby areas. I don't mean the Hamptons and Nantucket, but in places like Litchfield, for instance."
At any rate, Mrs. Bentley said, Houlihan/Lawrence will continue to pursue rental business.
"It not only helps us meet prospective buyers," she said. "But when we do rentals we establish a relationship with the owners. And even the guests of the tenants who come to visit become prospective clients, because they are introduced to the neighborhood."

HEADLINE: Lilco Deal Faces Huge Tax Liability

BYLINE: By JOHN RATHER 

 BODY:
A POTENTIAL Federal tax of $2 billion has become a major obstacle to a Long Island Power Authority plan to cut electric rates 12 percent.
The potential capital-gains liability has forced consideration of revised strategies, including one in which the authority would buy stock of the Long Island Lighting Company to gain control of selected assets. 
 That approach would depart from the authority's current plan, under which it would buy the transmission and distribution systems and Lilco would agree to sell its gas business and generators to other companies.
Experts said that the revised approaches now under discussion between the authority and the Long Island Lighting Company raised a fresh set of tax issues.
Another question is whether the Internal Revenue Service would exempt the authority from Federal taxes if the authority purchased Lilco's transmission and distribution systems, which are now taxpaying assets, with tax-exempt bonds to convert these systems into a tax-exempt status.
An I.R.S. ruling that tax-exempt bonds could not be used for such a purpose would deprive the authority of an important means of lowering rates.
The plan also calls for refinancing Lilco debt, including debt for the Shoreham nuclear power plant, with the tax-exempt bonds to lower rates.
The tax issues, which have been central in discussions between Lilco and the authority, hold the potential to delay or even derail a rate-cutting deal.
The new authority chairman, Frank G. Zarb, said that obtaining an I.R.S. opinion was a necessary step before negotiating a deal. If the Federal taxes are imposed, Mr. Zarb said, that would totally change financial assumptions in the plan.
Others said that imposing a large Federal tax would make the plan and its promised rate reduction unobtainable.
In an initial assessment, Mr. Zarb said agreement on a final plan would take a year to 18 months. But he added:
"We've got to go to the Treasury Department and get some decisions made. That's part of the time line. It's critical to get an I.R.S. opinion on some aspects of this plan that we have on the table now before we get much further because they have to agree with some of our assumptions."
Mr. Zarb, who lives in Oyster Bay and is chairman of Alexander & Alexander Services Inc., the large insurance brokerage, said at his first meeting as authority chairman that the problem of high electric costs was a "creeping crisis" more damaging to the economy than was commonly realized.
He said he agreed to become chairman after Gov. George E. Pataki had assured him that lowering electric rates was the highest priority. The Long Island rates are the second highest in the United States.
Mr. Zarb's statements about the need for an I.R.S. opinion represent a change in strategy. Under an earlier approach, the authority would have requested the opinion after Lilco and the authority had agreed on a deal. The new approach allows greater flexibility in devising a plan that is exempt from Federal taxes.
The authority and Lilco have agreed on a request that Lilco is to submit to the Treasury Department for an opinion on the tax questions.
Under the original plan, which Mr. Pataki backed and which the authority gave preliminary approval in February, the authority would have sold $4.5 billion in tax-exempt bonds and used that money to buy Lilco assets. Lilco would agree to sell its gas business and generators to the other utilities. Competition among owners of the generators would spur further cuts in electric costs, backers of the plan said.
An important question was how the I.R.S. would rule on the capital-gains taxes that Lilco would owe after selling its assets. The authority plan assumed that the I.R.S. would render a favorable ruling to defer payment of the tax, approximately $2 billion, if Lilco made a qualified reinvestment like one in the energy industry off Long Island in three years.
The assumption about the deferral relied on a section of the Tax Code involving cases where property is sold as part of a court-ordered condemnation or under the threat of condemnation.
But Mr. Zarb, who oversaw energy policy in the Ford Administration, made it clear after the board meeting that he disapproved of threatening condemnation.
That differs sharply from the approach of the former chairman, James F. Gill, who warned that if Lilco did not agree to the authority's plan it would use its statutory powers to condemn the company.
Mr. Gill resigned as chairman in March to return to private law practice.
Mr. Gill's remarks about condemnation were interpreted as signs of a tough approach to the talks with Lilco. But they were also apparently intended to assure deferral of the potential $2 billion capital-gains tax.
Lilco has been concerned about finding a reinvestment in the three years.
Under the revision, new questions have arisen. At issue is how the I.R.S. would view a purchase by the authority of Lilco assets if the authority, a tax-exempt agency, used the money from the sale of the tax-exempt bonds to buy the assets of a tax-paying private company.
Other authority leaders acknowledged that tax issues were now pre-eminent. "There is recognition by Lilco and Lipa of the importance of the Federal income-tax issues to a possible transaction," said Patrick J. Foye, chairman of the authority committee that devised the initial plan and a lawyer who specializes in mergers, acquisitions and privatization.
Richard M. Kessel, one of two trustees who voted against the plan in February, said last week that an opinion on taxes should have been sought soon after the plan was proposed in December. "If we had done this back in December," he added, "we probably would have known the answers by now. Instead we wasted five months."
Mr. Zarb agreed to hear proposals by Mr. Kessel and Deborah Pfeiffer, the other trustee who voted against the current plan, on alternative methods to achieve lower rates. "The plan that was proposed just doesn't work, and I'm glad that Frank is open to other concepts and proposals," said Mr. Kessel, a Democrat and another former chairman of the authority.
A final plan would have to be approved by Mr. Pataki; the State Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, Republican of Rensselaer, and Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, Democrat of Manhattan. Each has veto power.
Mr. Zarb gave general support to the authority plan. "The basic fundamentals of that plan are sound," he said. "But architecting a plan is easier than getting something implemented."
"The real job is just beginning," he told the trustees at the recent meeting, the first since the authority voted in February to begin formal talks with Lilco. He said the authority would soon name a new executive director to replace Anastasia Song, a member of Mr. Pataki's staff.
Parties to the talks between the authority and Lilco have withheld public comment. Many topics under discussion are covered by a confidentiality agreement that bars disclosure.
Lilco said in a statement: "We have a deep respect for Mr. Zarb and look forward to working with him to resolve energy issues on Long Island. We believe that he will help the negotiation process along."

MIGRATIONS AND CULTURES
 A World View.
 By Thomas Sowell.
 516 pp. New York:
 Basic Books. $30.
Thomas Sowell's behemoth of a book wades into the immigration and affirmative action wars armed with 2,431 footnotes and protected by a "voluminous literature of books, reports and scholarly journals," seeking to determine how migrations have transformed nations and continents over the course of human history. Considering the nasty turn these wars have taken -- with Pat Buchanan advocating a Berlin wall on the Mexican frontier and black demagogues calling for an "Asianrein" 125th Street -- and considering that Mr. Sowell is an economist on the staff of Stanford University's conservative Hoover Institution who frequently writes for Forbes and The Wall Street Journal, it is understandable that he should want to protect his rather common-sense theories with this carapace of scholarship. 
 Mr. Sowell draws his theories from six absorbing case histories, describing in "Migrations and Cultures" how Germans, Italians, Japanese, Chinese, Jews and Indians have transformed and been transformed by their new homelands. The details are fascinating -- a "Believe It or Not" of cultural and racial curiosities.
We learn that the first Jew elected to public office in America -- and possibly anywhere in the modern world -- was sent from South Carolina to the Provincial Congress in 1774; that we can thank Germans for the food, marching bands and sporting competitions that have become the essential ingredients of an all-American Fourth of July; and that in the 19th century almost half of the Russian high command was made up of ethnic Germans, the same people responsible for the Odessas and Moscows scattered across the center of North America. He informs us that although Jews were only 5 percent of Berlin's population in 1905, they paid 31 percent of its income tax, and although Japanese owned less than 2 percent of the land in the Brazilian state of Sao Paulo in the early 1930's, they produced almost a third of its agricultural output. Ten percent of all anesthesiologists in the United States are Indians, we are told, as are 40 percent of all small-motel owners.
From facts like these Mr. Sowell draws conclusions ranging from the obvious to the provocative. It is not surprising that many migrants arrive destitute, succeed through hard work, thrift and strong family ties, convert business success to higher education for their offspring, excite envy and persecution from native populations and increase the wealth of their new countries. But Mr. Sowell's principal conclusion is more controversial. He believes the habits and beliefs that migrants bring to a new homeland, what he calls their cultural capital, are far more important in determining their fate than the homeland's economy, culture or politics.
This is a theory that deflates any windbag oratory about the United States being a unique land of opportunity, where migrants succeed by discarding their former culture and leaping naked into the great melting pot. To the contrary, Mr. Sowell demonstrates that Germans, Japanese, Italians and others have enjoyed very similar patterns of achievement in Australia, the United States, Asia and South America, thanks largely to their cultural capital. He explains why, for example, Japanese migrants have prospered in the quite different environments of Brazil, Peru and the United States, becoming known in each place for honesty, reliability and perseverance.
As further proof of the importance and lasting effects of cultural capital, Mr. Sowell cites the contrasting experiences of Japanese in the United States and Brazil. Those in the United States loyally supported the country during World War II despite being interned, while those in Brazil, who were treated far more leniently, were so fanatically pro-Japanese that they refused to believe Japan had surrendered, and assassinated 16 of their leaders who said it had. Mr. Sowell's explanation is that Japanese arrived in Brazil and the United States at different times, bearing quite different stocks of cultural capital. Those choosing the United States came during the pro-American Meiji era of 1868-1912, while the migration to Brazil occurred during the nationalist and racist Tasiho era that followed.
Mr. Sowell's assertion that variations in cultural capital among migrants inevitably produce economic and social disparities will unsettle multiculturalists who believe that all cultures make equivalent contributions to human progress. He does not criticize multiculturalism for celebrating migrants, only for doing so superficially and indiscriminately. For him, cultures are more than grab bags of quaint customs equally deserving of respect and praise; they involve differences in social choices, economic efficiency and political stability, in the relative significance people attach to such fundamentals as sex, art, thrift, violence and the "particular ways of accomplishing the things that make life possible."
Rather than attacking affirmative action programs on moral grounds, Mr. Sowell argues that they are futile and costly attempts to push the boulder of history uphill. He writes that "gross statistical disparities in the 'representation' of groups in different occupations, industries, income levels and educational institutions have been the rule -- not the exception -- across the planet."
Mr. Sowell understands that culture and migration are sensitive subjects. He treads carefully, separating race from culture, declaring that cultural similarities often transcend race (as in the case of the Chinese of the Caribbean, who have been assimilated into the West Indian culture) and mentioning several prosperous African minorities to prove that no race has a monopoly on cultural success. He cautions against substituting the dogma that culture is everything for one that says the society into which a migrant group moves is the determinant of its fate. "A given culture is of course not stamped on a given people for all time," Mr. Sowell explains, "but neither does it evaporate in a few years or even in a given lifetime." Although he believes the past, like geography, lies beyond the reach of policy makers, he does concede that political programs can sometimes moderate or exacerbate an outcome.
"Migrations and Cultures" speaks most powerfully and eloquently to the current debate over immigration, although perhaps not entirely as its author intends. Few will read Mr. Sowell's accounts of coolies and untouchables rising in a generation from conditions of de facto slavery to prosperity without being moved by the power of human determination, or read about how migrants have enriched their new homelands without appreciating that population transfers have been one of the great engines of human progress.
But it is curious that after convincing us of this, Mr. Sowell should speculate that technological advances may be making the physical movement of humans superfluous, since "neither technological nor managerial human capital requires mass immigration for its diffusion." An argument can perhaps be made for the proposition that cultural genius can be disseminated through the Internet and international trade, but Mr. Sowell has not made it. Instead, his book reinforces the notion that the wealth-creating alchemy of migration is intertwined with the hardship of the journey, the struggle to prosper in a new homeland and the magical sparks that fly when people transport their cultures across boundaries and oceans.
It seems more likely to me that technological advances, particularly ones encouraging the globalization of taste, are devaluing cultural capital, and that as cultures become more alike they will have less to offer one another. How much cultural capital, after all, does a young German or Indian who eats Big Macs, wears Nikes, adores Arnold Schwarzenegger movies and watches MTV bring to Los Angeles?
If the slick, icy surface of shared symbols and tastes continues glazing the earth, smoothing over the bumps and cracks left by distinctive cultures, then we may be facing something more alarming than banal multicultural fairs and potentially harmful affirmative action programs. If, as Mr. Sowell argues, cultural capital has been the great engine of human progress, we may be facing a cultural ice age.
I have other disagreements with Mr. Sowell, but who would not, given this immense, complicated and timely subject? A treatise about migrations and cultures completely pleasing to every position would not be worth a glance. Instead, this is a lively and provocative book that is important reading for anyone who thinks we have too many immigrants or too few, who favors affirmative action and multicultural programs or opposes them. Well reasoned and impressively researched, "Migrations and Cultures" is, in the end, a formidable achievement.

HEADLINE: Botanists Join Fight To Save Butternut

BYLINE: By ANNE C. FULLAM 

DATELINE: SOMERS

 BODY:
THE United State Forest Service, in search of a few good butternut trees, found instead a couple of retired botanists who want to help the Government save the species from a deadly fungus, which is killing butternut trees nationwide.
Federal foresters have pinned their hopes of saving the butternut tree on a grafting program, which joins scions, or cuttings, from healthy butternuts to black walnut saplings. Until now, the only place in the country where the grafting was being done was at a Federal laboratory in St. Paul. 
 Since April, however, two botanists, Ilse Biederman, a horticulturist with a specialty in tissue culture, and Lola Koerting, a plant geneticist, both of whom had been with the Brooklyn Botanical Gardens research station in Ossining, are doing some of the state's grafting locally.
The two retired women got permission to use Lasdon Park and Arboretum in Somers, the former 186-acre estate of William and Mildred Lasdon owned since 1986 by the county, to graft healthy scions onto more than 100 black walnut seedlings shipped from Albany.
Their findings will be reported to the United States Forest Service.
Ted Kozlowski, a forester with the state's Department of Environmental Conservation, said that after an article about the butternut trees appeared in this section on Jan. 7, he was contacted by the retired scientists.
Discovered in Wisconsin in 1967, the fungus that is killing butternut trees has spread throughout the tree's range, which extends from Minnesota to Mississippi to Maine. The nuts of the butternut tree are eaten by wildlife and prized by cooks as a tasty treat. The trees also provide valuable wood known as white walnut. Like its close cousin, black walnut, which is not affected by the disease, butternut is used in fine furniture, paneling and woodcarving. Experts fear that butternut could disappear if an effective effort is not made to find disease-resistant trees.
In New York, where butternut is second only to black walnut in economic value, state foresters are surveying the state for healthy butternut trees. Sick trees exhibit oval-shaped cankers that ooze inky fluid.
Once the primary fungus, named sirococcus clavigignenti-juglandacearum in 1979, invades a wound in the tree, a secondary infection by melanconis juglandis, takes place. The secondary disease does not kill the trees by itself.
Fungicides, because they kill healthy fungi as well as diseased fungi, are impractical to use in combatting disease except in nurseries or on plantations. Butternut grows mostly in the wild.

HEADLINE: Groups Mobilize to Stem Cutbacks

BYLINE: By MERRI ROSENBERG 

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS

 BODY:
SOCIAL service agencies, health-care providers, community groups and other organizations that serve the poor have been organizing conferences to discuss proposed budget cutbacks at both Federal and state levels.
The Coalition for the Homeless sponsored a legislative breakfast last month at the Y.W.C.A. here to consider how Gov. George E. Pataki's proposed budget would affect housing, child care, health care and other services for the homeless. The breakfast replaced the 10-year tradition of a dinner to raise funds for the homeless. 
 "We thought we needed a change and a new direction," said Anne Kauffman Nolon, chief executive officer of the Peekskill Area Health Center. Those interested in contributing to the Hope for the Homeless can send donations in care of Grace Episcopal Church, 171 East Post Road, Room 219, White Plains, N.Y. 10601.
With more than 3,550 homeless people in the county as of April (including 1,806 children), advocates were concerned about the proposed limitations of welfare benefits, ceilings on child-care subsidies and lack of increased Section 8 certificates, which help subsidize the rent for low-income households.
"The new welfare legislation does not represent meaningful and lasting reform," said Ernest Prince, president of the Urban League of Westchester. He addressed a somber audience, which included members of the State Assembly and Senate and the Congress. "It will place the lives of thousands of children and families in jeopardy. Quick fixes and bumper-sticker politics won't do it. The debate continues to be isolated from the other critical debate, which is that you cannot ignore the fact that the work force needs education and skills training. Pataki's proposals would have a 60-day limit on home relief, eliminate the grants for tuition and books and make poor people poorer. It's penalizing the least of us for simply being born."
Symra D. Brandon, a Councilwoman from Yonkers, said: "It's really depressing. It doesn't look like this is a bright picture. The city of Yonkers is going through real hard times, and many people will be impacted by these cuts. We have to try to come up with fail-safe measures to protect these constituents."
At the Greenburgh Westhelp site, where more than 1,100 homeless families have lived since the transitional housing center was opened five years ago, the proposed cutbacks threaten day care and therapeutic services as well as job training, educational help and counseling for substance abuse.
"The programs that make a significant difference in families' regaining their independence, in day care, education, job training and placement and medical care are all threatened by the current county, state and Federal cuts," said Maria Cuomo Cole, chairwoman of Help, an umbrella organization that provides services for homeless families. "We know that our families require day care in order for parents to look for permanent housing, secure educational degrees and get jobs. We're taking a giant step backward with these cuts."
To compound the problem, health care is also in jeopardy. "What seems to be happening is that there is a move to put responsibility for services to the more local levels," Ms. Nolon said. "The aim is to cut the service package. It puts incentive in the wrong direction. There's a move on the part of everyone to reduce costs with no caring about individuals. When you centralize eligibility certification, homeless people who don't get mail and don't have transportation to get there, have to face another set of barriers."
The proposed cutbacks would be especially damaging to children, according to a recently released report from the Children's Defense Fund of New York. Its report projected the cost of child poverty by analyzing the impact on future earnings. It said that for the 18,000 children who live in poverty in the county, nearly $217 million would be lost in potential earning power. The Governor's proposed cuts of 7 percent in welfare grants would actually cost the state $322 million a year in these children's lower lifetime earnings, according to the report's analysis, while the saving would be $114 million a year.
"We have a deficit because of the tax-cut promises," said Betsy Mulvey of the Fiscal Policy Institute in Latham, N.Y. "Underinvesting in children today is penny wise and pound foolish. Cutting services and programs to children now will come back to haunt us later."
Melinda Dutton of the Children's Defense Fund of New York said: "Poverty affects children, even intermittently. Given the current attempts to drastically reduce A.F.D.C., this report is particularly timely."
For Robbyn Laury, a former homeless mother of three who receives grants and now lives in her own apartment in Mount Vernon, the issue is not theoretical. "I am the face of welfare," said Ms. Laury, who recently completed a computer course to earn a certificate in word processing. "Welfare is not a luxury. It is not a picnic raising children on welfare. It's a must. This is what we have to do. I have trouble making ends meet. It doesn't keep me above the poverty level. Those of us who are able to work should work, but let us keep the benefits for one full year so we can save money. If I started working at McDonald's today, I can't pay my rent. Education will make our children fly."
Local Summit, a community organization on the Sound side of the county, is planning an event on June 10 to highlight human services resources in that area as well as to discuss the impact of the proposed budget cuts on various community groups.
"Our group's goal is to make the community aware that it, as well as the service agencies, have a commitment to those who are suffering economically," said Harold Wolfson, a member of Local Summit. "We want people to consider volunteering their time, or giving money, to these groups." At the June 10 meeting, which will take place at 7:30 P.M. at the Emelin Theater in Mamaroneck, Local Summit will also present a 50-page guide to assistance available in the community.

HEADLINE: Schools Scramble to Find More Room

BYLINE: BY SUSAN PEARSALL 

 BODY:
WHEN public school administrators are asked about rising enrollment figures, many cannot resist offering novel solutions for squeezing more students into overcrowded schools, like so many sardines packed in a tin.
In Woodbury, for example, old locker rooms have been turned into classrooms and book closets have been converted for small group instruction at Mitchell Elementary School, while special education classes are being held in a former janitorial supply closet at the middle school. 
 At E. O. Smith High School in Storrs, there are no study halls and juniors and seniors are allowed to leave campus for lunch, a privilege that attempts to address how the school's 940 students could have lunch in a cafeteria that holds 200 at a time. In South Windsor, there are 12 portable classrooms in use at Timothy Edwards Middle School, where recently, the stage was removed from a multipurpose room to provide 80 more seats at lunch.
Since 1991, the number of students enrolled in Wallingford schools has increased by 800 to 6,700 students, causing serious crowding at the elementary level. This fall, the district will reopen Yalesville Elementary School, closed in 1987 and now being enlarged to nearly triple its original size.
"They were here before we could expand the building," lamented Joseph Cirasuolo, superintendent of Wallingford schools.
Planning consultants say the trouble stems from an "echo baby boom," the result of baby boomers having babies. In 1990, more than 50,000 babies were born in Connecticut, the highest birth rate in 20 years. Last fall, those children entered kindergarten on the heels of several other large classes that also are part of the boomlet.
Statewide projections indicate the number of children entering kindergarten will begin to decline slowly this fall, as baby boom women move beyond prime childbearing age. A difficult economy and significant out-migration have also slowed the birth rate, experts say.
Elementary school enrollments are expected to peak in 1997-98, according to the Department of Education. The bulge will then move to the middle schools, topping out in the school year 2002-2003. High school enrollments, already on the rise, are expected to grow through fiscal 2005-2006, the last year included in current projections. All together, the number of students attending Connecticut public schools is predicted to have increased by 84,000 between 1988 and 2001.
However, rising enrollments appear to be a mostly suburban phenomenon. "The central cities are quite different," said Hyung C. Chung , a planning consultant in Orange who prepares reports for individual school districts.
In Hartford, for instance, he expects high school enrollment to decline by nearly four percent between 1995 and 1999. But in Brookfield, Mr. Chung predicts the high school population will increase 33 percent by 2005. The cities tend to have lower enrollment rates, higher drop-out rates and more transient populations, he said.
To put the current situation in perspective, more than 55,000 babies were born each year in Connecticut from 1960 through 1964, with the largest number born in 1961. "That was the real baby boom," said Peter Prowda, a consultant for the state's Department of Education. Between 1965 and 1970, births averaged roughly 50,000 each year, he said. In 1971 and 1972 births dropped precipitously, reaching a low of 35,607 births in 1976. (Dr. Prowda said the sharp decline in the birth rate might have been affected by the legalization of abortion.)
Soon, the birth rate will fall again as the smaller number of women born in the mid-70's reaches childbearing age, Dr. Prowda said.
The current surge of students has sent school officials and architects to the drawing boards, trying to determine the best way to accommodate them.
Last month, the General Assembly approved $314 million for 154 school building and renovation projects, said David Wedge, director of the school facilities unit for the state's Department of Education. Last year, the legislature appropriated $124 million for another 124 projects.
This year's project list includes: 7 new schools, 33 additions to schools and 17 requests for portable classrooms, Mr. Wedge said. New buildings are planned for Watertown, Region 16 (Beacon Falls and Prospect), Ansonia, North Branford, Stamford and New Haven, where there are two proposals.
"Generally speaking, we look at about $100 per square foot for renovation and about $150 per square foot for a new facility," Mr. Wedge said. (The larger figure includes equipping a new school.) After the state approves its share of construction costs, based on a sliding scale tied to a community's relative wealth, local school boards have one year to secure financing.
And that's where the going get rough, officials said, especially in smaller districts where such issues are decided at referendums.
Recently, school building proposals were defeated in Avon and in Region 14, which includes Woodbury and Bethlehem. In April, voters in the Region 19 towns of Ashford, Mansfield and Willington approved a $31.3 million expansion project for E. O. Smith High School by 19 votes.
Four times since 1993, voters in Region 14 have turned down a $17.8 million proposal to add a total of 24 classrooms to three schools, as well as a gym at an elementary school, a new library for the middle school, space for high school music rehearsals, administrative offices and some maintenance work. In March, the proposal was approved in Woodbury and defeated by more than 500 votes in Bethlehem (pop. 3,286), the smaller of the towns.
"The taxpayers in Bethlehem are a very frugal group of people," said Robert Gallo, the First Selectman. "They want to see value for their dollar." He thinks residents are most likely to support a bond issue for basic classrooms, not office space or maintenance needs. Some residents also question the accuracy of enrollment projections, he said.
George Eggert, a former First Selectman in Bethlehem, has voted against the school building proposal all four times, even though he said it would not be a hardship for him to pay an estimated $500 per year tax increase on his large house. "I think they were spending much too much for what needs to be done within the system," he said.
Joseph P. Sabatella, superintendent of Region 14 schools, disagrees. "It would be foolish to build a brand new project and leave out classrooms that you're absolutely going to need," he said. Since 1990, population in the towns has increased by 26 percent, not counting two new housing developments recently approved in Woodbury, he said.
The school board will not place the full proposal on a ballot again, Dr. Sabatella says. Instead, improvements for Woodbury Middle School will be the subject of a fall referendum, he said.
Last October, Avon voters refused a $22 million renovation and expansion project for the high school. Since then, the plans have been scaled back to about $19 million, said Pamela Friedman, chairwoman of the school board.
A fall referendum will include three questions: expanding the main high school building, building a new gymnasium and improving athletic fields.
Frank R. Yulo is the executive director of the Connecticut Association of Public School Superintendents in West Hartford. He says selling building proposals today is much different from when he was a school superintendent in the 1960's and 1970's. Then, most taxpayers were parents of school-age children. "Today, maybe 30 percent of the taxpayers are parents," he said.
Now, superintendents often visit centers for elderly people when they campaign for new projects. "If they simply appeal to the parents, they will lose the referendum," Dr. Yulo said. "They have to get a broader consensus."
Bruce Silva, the superintendent for Region 19 schools in Ashford, Mansfield and Willington, spent much of the winter lobbying for a major addition to E. O. Smith High School. Originally, a referendum was scheduled for December, but that was pushed to April when Mr. Silva said he thought many residents remained uninformed. In the five weeks before the vote, "I was out every night making community presentations," he said. The measure passed by less than one percent of the votes cast.
Next year, Mr. Silva and his faculty will be faced with the challenges of holding classes in a construction zone.
Richard Nabel, the new principal at Hamden High School, is in the middle of a $40 million project to tear down and replace classroom wings, the gymnasium, pool and cafeteria. Only the original building, a 1935 Georgian style, three-story brick building with a cupola will remain, and that will be gutted and completely renovated.
Fortunately, Mr. Nabel has a good sense of humor. "This is fun," he replied, when asked how he was coping. The cafeteria, torn down during the April vacation, has been replaced with the Hard Hat Cafe, which serves meals and snacks in the former auto and metal shops. To speed construction, Mr. Nabel eliminated the traditional lunch period and shortened the school day by an hour. All study halls now meet in the cafe, and students eat as time permits.
Mr. Nabel said he tries to keep teachers informed of each step of the construction process, but concedes, "There's nothing I can do when a jackhammer is on outside your classroom and you're trying to teach poetry." And he takes the long view. "When it's done, we will have a magnificent facility," he said.
Suburban towns faced with surpassing enrollment projections might benefit from Southington's experience. The town's high school was built about 20 years ago and a $12 million addition was completed in 1987, said Louis D. Saloom, the district's superintendent. But it was not enough. The town, 18 miles south of Hartford, became a thriving bedroom community. More than 500 new homes have been built on 20 new roads in recent years, he said.
In 1993, work started on a $9.9 million addition that has added another 66,000 square feet to Southington High School, now almost double its original size. The latest addition, on three levels, includes space for 15 classrooms that have been roughed in, but not finished. If needed, the space could accommodate another 350 to 400 students, Dr. Saloom said.
"Our projections tend to underestimate what's happening," he said.

HEADLINE: Library's Birthday Points Up Fiscal Needs

 BODY:
While we savor the celebration of the Mount Vernon Public Library's 100th birthday ["Mount Vernon Library Marks Its 100th Year," May 12], with its diversity of community and its ability to adapt to change, we are reminded that the funding to support this noble institution is being cut constantly, and despite community support many services have been curtailed.
Let us be vigilantly aware that unless we, the taxpayers, encourage our elected officials to continue to support the concept of a free public library, the services that now are available to all patrons, regardless of their economic worth, may not be available in the course of the next 100 years. 
 Funding for public libraries is being scrutinized and cut to the point where officials are encouraging some pay-for-service. This means that the dream of America (and Mr. Carnegie) is being forgotten. For many of us, our parents or grandparents' first and only taste of education in America was through the "free" public library.
As we celebrate this 100th birthday for Mount Vernon, we learn through our library advocate network that the Yonkers Public Library may be forced to close as a result of that city's financial crisis. It behooves all elected officials in New York (and elsewhere) to put some priorities on funding library services, which truly add to the quality of life.

HEADLINE: In the Region/New Jersey;
Key Location Drives Morris Office Market

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
LAST year the eight-building, 850,000-square-foot Vreeland Road Business Center in Florham Park sat virtually empty and in the hands of its lender. Now all but one of the buildings have been, or soon will be, leased or sold to tenants.
The turnaround at the center, with buildings and a location south of Route 10 that are less than prime, reflect the strength of the office market in Morris County. With a total of 22 million square feet of space it is one of the largest in the 11-county northern New Jersey office market. And with leases steadily whittling down its available space it is also among the most active, brokers and developers say. 
 Over the last year some 2.9 million square feet were leased in the county, nudging up average annual asking rents to $19.44 a square foot from $19.18, and pushing the vacancy rate down by 7.1 percentage points to 15.1 percent, one of the lowest in the state. The rate for the entire market is 18.7 percent, according to the Cushman & Wakefield brokerage.
"The space game is that of the county's 3.3 million square feet of available space," said Donald P. Eisen, senior managing director at Cushman & Wakefield. "Just 600,000 feet is in prime buildings, in which there are few big blocks left." The vacancy rate in those buildings is 7.1 percent, down from 12.9 percent in 1995.
In turn, companies are expanding their options and considering secondary buildings like those on Vreeland Road, said David Simson, a vice president at CB Commercial's Teaneck office.
There, AT&T leased a 133,090-square-foot building and Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette Securities, a stock brokerage, bought one with 142,000 square feet. ABC had been negotiating to buy a 139,750-square-foot building for its Cable News Service in the business park, but plans for the service were shelved on May 23 and the deal fell through.
"We are in a rising market and have been deferring inquiries because of the commitment we had from ABC," said Peter G. Rasmusson, vice president at Galbreath/ Summer, which is marketing the Vreeland Road center. "We feel strongly that we can replace ABC in the building sooner rather than later."
The major reason the county is seeing such activity is location. It is served by several major highways, including Interstates 80 and 287 and Route 46, and is supported by hotels, all levels of housing and a skilled labor pool.
Another is that it had the most available space, remnants of the overbuilding of the last decade when 82 percent of its 22 million square feet was built. The more recent wave of corporate reconfigurations also returned space to the market.
In 1994, the county's vacancy rate was 25 percent; in 1992, it was more than 30 percent.
"Companies have begun to stabilize and are growing with cautious optismism," said Mr. Simson. He said much of the space was being leased by expanding local companies, with health, telecommunications and service concerns the most active. He said the pattern of companies relocating to Morris from eastern counties like Essex and Bergen persists.
The county is also expected to gain 33,400 new jobs by the year 2005, according to state data.
In addition, with new construction "still too expensive and time-consuming, companies are willing to take buildings and rebuild them," said Christopher W. Marra. He is the executive director of the nonprofit Morris Area Development Group, based in Morristown, which focuses on attracting new businesses to the county and retaining those already there.
Most brokers agree corporate consolidations are not over and space will come back onto the market. "But," said Mr. Eisen of Cushman & Wakefield, "the activity on the taking side is greater, leaving the market with a lot of momentum."
For instance, Novell Inc., the computer-software manufacturer, is expected to vacate its 242,000-square-foot building in Florham Park by year's end. AT&T is already rumored to be considering the space.
STILL, say brokers, a big question mark is what impact AT&T's breakup into three companies will have on the Morris County market, where it occupies five million square feet.
Meanwhile, deals are being made.
Bay Networks, which manufactures computer-networking equipment, is leaving 22,000 square feet elsewhere in Parsippany and expanding into 60,000 feet at the Prudential Business Campus, the 1.5 million-square-foot complex at the intersection of I-287 and Routes 10 and 22.
"In 1995, we had 500,000 square feet of available space, now we have 25,000 feet," said John S. Gregorits, managing vice president of Prudential Realty Group, a subsidiary of the insurer and the campus's owner with USWEST Real Estate in Denver. "The market is seeing the light at the end of the tunnel."
The center also landed the largest sale. American Cyanamid, a subsidiary of American Home Products Corporation, the health-care products company based in Madison, bought a 386,000-square-foot building that "better meets the company's need for modern space," said Lowell B. Weiner, its spokesman.
The deal removed one of the last big blocks from the market.
The shortage of big blocks of space and the need to move into the space quickly benefited the Vreeland Road Business Center, said Douglas H. Haynes, president of Galbreath/Summer in Paramus. The commercial real estate firm is marketing the center for Cigna Investments, the real estate arm of the insurer based in Hartford, which took back the site in foreclosure in 1994.
"These are specific user deals," said Mr. Haynes, noting that tenants had bought or leased the space "as is" and will improve it, saving the time and cost of new construction.
Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette bought a 142,000-square-foot building for its expanding Pershing Division, its stock transaction and processing arm, said Catherine M. Conroy, a spokesman. She said "a couple of hundred people" will move from leased space in Jersey City to the building, which will be rebuilt to meet the company's technological needs.
As the market tightens some brokers and developers foresee continued, though selective, activity in build-to-suit deals. One, a 268,000-square-foot office and distribution center is rising on the Prudential Business Campus for Tiffany & Company, the Manhattan jeweler. It will be completed in October.
AND a two-building, 151,000-square-foot corporate headquarters for Bayer Corporation's Consumer Care Division has just been completed at the corner of Columbia Turnpike and Whippany Road in Morris Township.
"Buildings will go up if they create better economics for companies," said Peter J. Cocoziello, president of Advance Properties in Bedminster, developer of the Bayer project. "But there isn't going to be a building boom."
Still, one builder plans to develop a speculative building, the first in the county in six years. Bellemead Development Corporation of Roseland, a subsidiary of Chubb Insurance, has approvals to build a 107,000-square-foot building at its Waterview Corporate Centre off Interstate 80 in Parsippany.
"We are readying to get in the ground this summer and am confident the market will permit us," said Robert R. Martie, a Bellemead vice president. "It is in an upward cycle."

HEADLINE: In the Region/Connecticut;
New Housing for People With Special Needs

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES 

 BODY:
FORTY single men and women are about to move into 40 new rental apartments in Middletown dedicated to substance abusers, the homeless, people with AIDS and those incapacitated by psychiatric disorders.
The project, called Liberty Common, at 8 Liberty Street, was built by the Connecticut chapter of the nonprofit Corporation for Supportive Housing. 
 Two weeks ago Gov. John G. Rowland attended a groundbreaking at The Colony, a Supportive Housing site on Ludlow Street in Stamford where 29 units will be built for occupancy in April 1997. Supportive Housing and its local sponsor, St. Luke's Community Services, are now seeking approval to renovate two turn-of-the-century rowhouses on Atlantic Street for 27 apartments.
The program was initiated during the administration of Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. with authority to raise $20 million in bonds. So far, $15.3 million has been committed for 10 projects planned, under way or completed -- two each in Stamford, Hartford, and Bridgeport, and one each going through the approvals process in New Haven, Middletown, Meriden, and Willimantic. The cost of the projects ranges from $1.1 million to $3.5 million.
"We started out with 12," said Janice Elliott, director of the statewide program, "and we lost two, but that's not bad. We're thrilled. There are over 10,000 individuals in shelters or transitional housing in Connecticut, not counting another 7,000 estimated to be in abandoned buildings, on the street or families."
Mr. Weicker viewed the supportive-housing concept as a more economical use of government housing money. "Institutionalizing costs $100,000 a year per person," said Julie Sandorf, president of the parent Corporation for Supportive Housing in Manhattan. "Shelters cost $21,000, while supportive housing costs $10,000 to $15,000 a year."
The Middletown building was converted from a 20's hotel that had deteriorated into a "flophouse," according to Thomas Stickney, executive director of The Connection Fund, a nonprofit community-action agency. The fund cobbled together funds from 12 local agencies, 6 state agencies and numerous corporations to pay for the $3.5 million renovation. The 400-square-foot studios have kitchens, bathrooms, window blinds and some furniture.
To qualify as tenants, applicants must have completed appropriate rehabilitative programs and proven themselves capable of living independently, holding a job or enrolling in job training and voluntarily availing themselves of counseling or assistance. Referrals to a range of social and mental-health services are provided through case managers -- about one for every 10 tenants -- who are on call 40 hours a week, but do not live on the premises.
TENANTS may earn no more than 50 percent or less of the area's median income for single persons, which in Middletown is $38,900, and must pay 30 percent of their income as rent. The median income in Stamford is $58,000.
Half the tenants receive rent subsidies from the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development and a reserve fund from private investment is available to help the remaining tenants. As long as tenants behave responsibly they can stay permanently, but an increase in income will trigger a rent increase, said Ms. Elliott of the Corporation for Suportive Housing in Connecticut.
Since the project had been started under Governor Weicker, Ms. Elliott said, "we were nervous about the change in administration, "but we found that Governor Rowland has quite consistently funded the new projects."
Since its founding in 1991 with $10 million from a coalition of the Pew Charitable Trusts, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and the Ford Foundation, several Supportive Housing chapters have sprung up across the country.
"To date we have 6,500 units occupied, in construction or in development in Michigan, Georgia, Minnesota, New York, California, Illinois, and Connecticut," said Ms. Sandorf. But she voiced concern that "massive Federal retrenchment of housing dollars makes the program's future precarious because of its effect on rent subsidies."
Connecticut's program, which was seeded with $450,000 from the Melville Charitable Trust, a family philanthropy, is the first statewide appplication of the concept, coordinating public, corporate and nonprofit participation. Permanent construction financing is provided by the Connecticut Housing and Finance Authority and the Connecticut Department of Economic and Community Development, which deals with housing.
Several Fortune 500 companies have invested in the projects -- among them, the renovation of the former Times Square Hotel on West 43d Street in Manhattan. These funds are funneled through the National Equity Fund, a large, nonprofit syndicator of low-income housing tax credits.
While the Times Square Hotel renovation is considered one of Supportive Housing's many successes, Ms. Sandorf said she perceived "a climate in this country of increased fear and tension around issues of poverty" that prevents some projects from going forward.
The fact that only single tenants are chosen -- based on research showing that 85 percent of people in these situations are unmarried -- has also been off-putting to family-oriented communities, she added.
Stamford had to relinquish one site and find another because of local resistance, and Bristol and New Britain rejected proposals outright.
"The site in New Britain was a historic building downtown, and people felt that 32 apartments in one building was too concentrated," said Sarajane Pickett, the city's director of planning. "We think it's more appropriate to scatter them around."
Instead, said Edward C. Pasco, coordinator of the New Britain Community Coalition Housing Committee, "we are trying on our own to consolidate several HUD grants for low income shelter and social service programs, and funding from the State Department of Mental Health for 20 units scattered through New Britain, Bristol and six other towns."
The coalition was Supportive Housing's local sponsor.
IN Bristol, local opposition by a grass-roots neighborhood organization to Supportive Housing's use of a downtown commercial building convinced local authorities to withdraw support, said Allan Weiner, the town planning director.
Last February the local sponsor, Bristol Community Organization, received notice from the Commissioner of Mental Health that state funds were being withdrawn. "Rowland inherited this," said Thomas H. Morrow, the Bristol organization's director, "and he is averse to forcing projects on communities where there is opposition."
One of Hartford's proposed new projects, a 30-unit rental called Mary Seymour Place Apartments, has all its local and state approvals and a building permit. But a lawsuit filed in Superior Court last April by Cynthia Jennings, a local resident, has put the project on hold. She is appealing the rejection by the Zoning Board of Appeals of a charge by neighbors that the project is a rehabilitation home in violation of residential and commercial zoning.
Hartford's second project of 28 units, called Hudson View Commons, is under construction for a fall opening, and the conversion of Bridgeport's landmarked 38-unit Edinburgh Crescent building is expected to be ready for occupancy on Dec. 1. And the Central Connecticut Coastal Y.M.C.A., sponsors of a second new building with 34 studio and one-bedroom units proposed for Fairfield Avenue in Bridgeport, is applying for state and local approval.
"A lot is going on in scattered units," said Ms. Elliot, "and if it's appropriate we can do that." But on the downside, she said, "people feel isolated, case managers have to travel all over the place, and there isn't the same assurance of good quality housing -- which helps to make good tenants."

HEADLINE: City Seeking An Exterior Decorator

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
STREET FURNITURE is the name given by urban designers to all that stuff on the sidewalks: newsstands, bus-stop shelters, pay phones, newspaper vending machines, lampposts, kiosks, trash baskets and, in cities that have them, public toilet stalls.
One does not need a degree in urban design to see that New York's street furniture could use more than a simple dusting. 
 "Improving the quality of life in the city has to deal with the physical city, what it looks like," said Deputy Mayor Fran Reiter, who is in charge of planning and economic development.
"The city's history in this regard is not a good one," Ms. Reiter said. "There has never been a coordinated effort to say what we want to allow or not allow, what esthetic values do we want to bring to street furniture. We don't have public toilets in New York. We have unsightly newsstands. We have bus-stop shelters that, while functional, are not the newest generation."
Trying to address several issues at once, the Giuliani administration is advancing a plan under which a single contractor would be awarded a 20-year franchise to build, maintain and operate at least 30 public toilets, 430 newsstands and 3,300 bus-stop shelters.
The structures could carry illuminated advertising panels, potentially generating gross receipts of more than $600 million over the life of the contract. The revenue would pay for the construction and maintenance of the new street furniture and the contractor's debt service. It would also generate, officials estimate, at least $5 million a year for the city. Officials said they would encourage structures "as small as possible consistent with their function" and look for "innovation and flexibility" in design.
One innovation to which New Yorkers might be introduced would be pillar-style newsstands, modeled on Parisian kiosks, up to 16 feet tall and 6 1/2 feet in diameter, similar to those built in the last year in San Francisco. The newsstands could have up to 108 square feet of advertising in one or two panels. (Current bus-stop shelters have 42 square feet of advertising on two panels.)
Like almost every street-furniture initiative in the last two decades, the franchise plan is beset by controversy.
On May 20, the City Planning Commission initiated the review of the request for proposals. That is the document in which the city outlines its criteria for a project and asks potential contractors to respond. The Giuliani administration submitted the land-use terms -- but not the business terms -- for review.
Leaders of the City Council were infuriated, saying they were entitled to scrutinize the entire package. They are now threatening to rescind authorization for the franchise altogether. The matter is to be considered Tuesday by the Council's land-use committee. Its chairwoman, June M. Eisland, a Bronx Democrat, said, "Land use can't be separated from business."
Ms. Eisland and Walter L. McCaffrey, chairman of the zoning and franchises subcommittee, told Deputy Mayor Reiter in a letter that "if the citizens of New York are to have confidence in this massive undertaking to place thousands of structures on public sidewalks, the best way to proceed is to release the entire R.F.P. -- not just those portions of the document which the administration deems fit for public review."
But Ms. Reiter said that pure business terms had no place in land-use review or, indeed, any kind of public review while they were still being drafted. "Whether somebody pays us 10 percent of the ad revenues or 12 percent has no land-use implications whatsoever," she said.
The current imbroglio over street furniture is merely the latest in a series stretching back to the mid-70's, when the first bus-stop shelters were built. In 1977, City Comptroller Harrison J. Goldin recommended that the franchise be awarded competitively. The successful bidder was the Convenience and Safety Corporation, one of whose principals, Saul P. Steinberg, had contributed to Mr. Goldin's political campaign.
As a result, questions were raised about the Comptroller's involvement in the process. However, a report by the city's Investigation Department in 1981 found "insufficient evidence to establish that the Comptroller in any way abused the power of his office" and an investigation by the United States Attorney's office also cleared Mr. Goldin of any criminal liability.
Nonetheless, the agreement with Convenience and Safety was canceled. In 1981, the shelters were taken over by Miller Sign Associates. In 1987, the Board of Estimate held Miller in default on its contract.
The board then awarded a contract to New York Shelter Media, to repair and maintain the 1,200 existing shelters and build 1,751 new ones. New York Shelter Media was acquired by Gannett Company, Inc., in 1988. Gannett Outdoor New York, a subsidiary, continues as the contractor.
Not long after it had seemed that the bus-stop shelter problem was finally solved, the issue of public toilets arose. In 1990, the Legal Action Center for the Homeless sued the city for its failure to provide toilets; a failure that exposed homeless people to "continual embarrassment, humiliation, physical injury and hazardous condition," in the words of the lawsuit.
DURING the administration of Mayor David N. Dinkins, a four-month test was conducted at three locations in Manhattan, featuring toilets built by JCDecaux, the French company that claims credit for having invented the self-cleaning public toilet. (While in New York for the 1992 Democratic convention, Mayor Frank Jordan of San Francisco tried one of the units. Two years later, his city was the first in the United States to sign with JCDecaux USA, which is based in Manhattan.)
In 1993, two separate toilet plans were undertaken by the Dinkins administration. The first, under the Transportation Department, was to provide 40 automated public toilets at sidewalk locations, to be supported by the revenues from 80 advertising kiosks, each of them up to 20 feet high.
As that plan dragged through review, Mayor Dinkins launched a second proposal to install 30 public toilets on property controlled by the Parks Department, with the ratio of two ad kiosks for every toilet. He said this proposal could move more rapidly than the Transportation Department plan, since it was not subject to the land-use review procedure involving the Planning Commission, Council and community boards.
But JCDecaux and Gannett quickly withdrew from the parks project, saying that the limit of two ad kiosks for every toilet would not generate enough revenue to support the construction and maintenance of the toilets. (In San Francisco, the ratio is four and a half to one, meaning that 90 pillar-style newsstands and public-service kiosks support 20 automated public toilets.)
Eventually, there was one bidder on the Parks Department franchise, Wall City Design. When the City Council modified the Transportation Department franchise to require a one-year testing period before a request for proposals would even be issued, contractors' interest virtually evaporated.
"They were literally asking companies to spend $1 million to participate in an R.F.P.," said Craig D. Muraskin, special assistant to Deputy Mayor Reiter.
That was the situation inherited by the Giuliani administration. Deputy Mayor Reiter convened an interagency "streetscape task force" in 1994 and the toilet plans were scrapped to allow a more comprehensive approach, Mr. Muraskin said.
IN April 1995, on the recommendation of the task force, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani signed an executive order calling for the eventual clearing of any but the most vitally needed structures from every street corner and "corner quadrant," an L-shaped area extending 10 feet along the sidewalk from the intersection.
As the task force continued its work, Gannett's shelter contract was nearing expiration. "The bus-stop shelter program has been working reasonably well," Mr. Muraskin said, "but it became very clear that there was a lot more the city could do."
For example, shelters could come in different shapes and sizes, perhaps longer and wider for express buses, perhaps with Gothic details in a historic district. Public telephones could be incorporated into the shelters, rather than standing apart. There might be display boards showing time, weather forecasts, maybe even when the next cluster of buses was coming.
Advertising was clearly an important part of the shelter program. But the task force was rethinking the idea of freestanding ad kiosks to support public toilets. "The number of these kiosks was totally contrary to what we wanted to do," Mr. Muraskin said. "This was a lot of clutter to support one single amenity."
So where would advertising appear if there were not kiosks? Newsstands seemed to be the answer. And they, too, were under scrutiny by the task force. "Newsstands have long been a blight," Mr. Muraskin said. "The structures run from total disaster to something that, if it looked nice to begin with, has fallen apart."
What emerged from these three previously unrelated strands was the "coordinated street-furniture franchise" proposal, under which the Transporation Department would award a 20-year franchise contract covering at least 3,760 structures -- bus-stop shelters, newsstands and toilets.
Potential contractors would also be encouraged to provide "public-service structures": newspaper and magazine dispensers, recycling or litter bins, bicycle racks, pay telephones and computerized displays furnishing civic or commercial information.
WHILE the contractor would be responsible for the newsstand structures, it would not operate them. As a corollary, the Giuliani administration also proposes to change the newsstand operating system. Rather than charge $1,050 for two-year licenses at given locations, the city would award concessions to the highest bidders for each spot, some of which, the city estimates, might command $100,000 a year.
The New York City Newsstand Operators Association and the major newspaper publishers oppose this measure, maintaining that such a system would drive operators out of business and reduce the number of news outlets and jobs.
In a related initiative, the Giuliani administration is also seeking to regulate newspaper vending machines, also known as "honor boxes." Under proposed legislation, the boxes could no longer be chained to lampposts and signposts. They would have to be moved out of the corner quadrants. And publishers would have to register each box.
George Freeman, an assistant general counsel of The New York Times Company, said that vending box guidelines had been in place since 1984 and that "to reinvent the wheel seems like a mammoth waste of time."
He said the chaining of boxes "serves everyone's purpose" by allowing publishers more flexibility in placement than they would have if machines were bolted to the pavement. And he said that if boxes were kept away from intersections, the existence of other excluded zones around bus-stop shelters and fire hydrants would make them wind up in the middle of the block, where, he said, they are not as accessible.
Under the coordinated franchise, the Transportation Department would require structures that were "esthetically pleasing" and available in several sizes and configurations to accommodate the demands of various sites, including historic districts.
Some specifics would be as follows:
* Bus-stop shelters could be no larger than 150 square feet. They could carry up to 70 square feet of advertising on one or two panels. They would be built or retrofitted over six years; 550 a year.
* Newsstands could be box-like (no larger than 72 square feet) or pillar style. Either type could carry up to 108 square feet of advertising on one or two panels. They would be built over three years; 144 in the first year, 143 in the second and third year.
* Toilets could be box-like (no larger than 78 square feet) or pillar style (up to 16 feet high, with a maximum diameter of 8 feet). They could carry ad panels, but it is not widely expected that advertisers would seek space on toilets. They would be built over two years; 15 a year.
* Public-service structures could be box-like (no larger than 36 square feet) or pillar style (up to 16 feet high, with a maximum diameter of 6 feet). They could carry up to 42 square feet of advertising.
The contractor would benefit from "economies of scale," Deputy Mayor Reiter said, needing only one maintenance program, architectural firm, engineer, administrative office and advertising sales office.
Executives at JCDecaux and Gannett believe that New York City has found a potentially successful economic formula.
"It makes excellent sense," said Suzanne Davis, senior vice president of JCDecaux USA. "Finally, the city has figured out something that will work. To have it supported by bus-stop shelters and newsstands, we'll be able to afford these expensive toilets and the kind of maintenance that the city needs."
GANNETT would be "very excited" to submit a proposal for a larger street-furniture franchise, said Joan Davidson, the vice president for public affairs."We think the newsstands will be very valuable from an advertising standpoint," she said. "The distribution is quite good. They currently exist where we know our advertisers want to buy advertising."
It might be expected that prospective contractors would applaud the concept. But so also do members of the Real Estate Board of New York, who have been bedeviled by ramshackle structures that clutter the sidewalks in front of their buildings, obscuring -- even blocking -- entrances, driveways and store windows.
The board has endorsed both the Mayor's clear-corner policy and the coordinated franchise proposal, said Warren Wechsler, its first senior vice president.
"A single provider should have the street-furniture concession for reasons of economy of scale," Mr. Wechsler said.
Landlords are concerned, however, about the effects of new billboards just outside the windows of their retail tenants. "Advertising should be location-sensitive," Mr. Wechsler said, "which is to say that Benetton should not be allowed to advertise in front of a Gap."
The Municipal Art Society, which has in the past battled both the Real Estate Board and intrusive advertising on city streets, also favors the coordinated franchise as a significant stride toward "changing the city's relative indifference about managing its streetscapes," said its president, Brendan Sexton. He added, however, that "many details need to be discussed, such as the amount, size and location of the structures and their billboards."
These were lively discussions of just these issues in San Francisco in the last year as JCDecaux began installing automated public toilets and kiosk-style newsstands. Last year, The San Francisco Chronicle praised the "world-class" public toilets as "useful, attractive and convenient."
But after taking office in January, Mayor Willie L. Brown Jr. expressed concern that JCDecaux had not fulfilled its end of the bargain, because it had built the advertising kiosks faster than the toilets they were supposed to support.
Barbara Kaufman, a member of the Board of Supervisors (equivalent to the City Council), complained in February that the "permit process was pretty much a nightmare from beginning to end."
"Many tenants and buildings weren't notified," she said. "Storefronts were blocked by kiosks often displaying advertising of a competitor. A particular pet peeve of mine is Market Street, which I believe has just been glutted with advertising."
SINCE then, JCDecaux has refunded about $37,000 in revenue generated by the "surplus" kiosks, said P. J. Johnston, Mayor Brown's acting press secretary.
"The Mayor has changed from being unhappy with this group to being optimistic about a future relationship," Mr. Johnston said. "He was not a real fan of the kiosks, esthetically speaking, but has come to terms with them and indicated his desire to expand the role of Decaux."
And a spokeswoman for Supervisor Kaufman said that JCDecaux had "become a lot more cooperative" in recent months.
Ms. Davis, the senior vice president, said JCDecaux had "frankly gone beyond the requirements of the contract" in accommodating Mayor Brown. She said the company was "very pleased" with the operation, which marks its first anniversary next week. They have been used over 200,000 times, Ms. Davis said, with "no major problems and less vandalism than anticipated."
Another debate about advertising on street furniture can be expected as New York City moves toward a franchise system for the 24,000 or so independently operated pay phones on city streets.
Currently, independent pay phones -- that is, those operated by businesses other than Nynex -- are not authorized to carry advertising, said Paul S. Jason, secretary and legal counsel to the Independent Pay-phone Association of New York.
There are illuminated ad panels on roughly one-quarter of the 8,000 Nynex telephones on the street, said Frank McLoughlin, the company's vice president for government affairs. The advertising, which is handled by TDI International, began to appear 11 years ago. The franchise runs until 1998.
Among other restrictions, there cannot be advertising on telephone enclosures near bus-stop shelters that also have ad panels. Advertising is prohibited altogether in certain zoning districts. Nynex also does not put tobacco advertising on enclosures that are near hospitals or high schools, Mr. McLoughlin said.
The city's Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications is planning to offer franchises for independently owned pay phones, which would allow those operators to place advertising on their enclosures, subject to restrictions that govern the Nynex program.
Mr. Jason said it was his understanding that the franchise would not automatically confer the right to place ad panels on a telephone enclosure. "You have to get a separate permit for advertising," he said.
Mr. Muraskin said the independent pay-phone industry "needs to be regulated from performance standards and from the streetscape perspective."
"We want to make sure they co-exist with the other things we're trying to improve," he said.

HEADLINE: PERSPECTIVES;
Changing the Approach in Low-Income Housing

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER 

 BODY:
THE 111th Street Oldtimers will be playing their annual stickball game on July 14 on the block between Fifth Avenue and Lenox Avenue in Harlem. They have been doing it for 28 years, but this year there will be a difference.
On the Lenox Avenue end of the block and in a schoolyard on the north side, local merchants will hold a street fair. Part of the proceeds will benefit the tenants association of the New West apartments, the handsomely rehabilitated five-story apartments that run along the south side of the street. 
 "The neighborhood has changed for the better," said Robert Guilbe, a 54-year-old administrator at Boricua College in Brooklyn. He is a native of 109th Street, a resident of the Schomburg Plaza development at 1295 Fifth Avenue and an organizer of the annual stickball game.
A major cause of that change is the rehabilitation of New West apartments, running along the south side of 111th Street from Fifth Avenue to Lenox Avenue. Completed in 1980, the development was inspired by tenant activism and achieved under the auspices of the Settlement Housing Fund, a major nonprofit developer. The apartments are affordable to its tenants because they are subsidized under the Federal low-income housing program known as Section 8.
The New West development is one of the 252 federally insured projects in New York City that receive direct "project-based" Federal subsidies every year. The 173 apartments are among the 22,250 low-income units in the city that similarly rely on regular governmental payments for their economic viability. These apartments are distributed in buildings with 29,600 apartments, some of the buildings mixed-income rather than entirely low-income.
Now the Clinton administration and Congress, as part of their deficit-reduction efforts, are looking at ways to steeply reduce future outlays through a plan known as "portfolio re-engineering," formerly called the "mark-to-market" plan. To understand how it would work, and why it is considered necessary, a historical explanation is necessary.
To create new or gut-rehabilitated housing for low-income people under the Section 8 program starting in the 70's, the Government agreed to insure about $15 billion of 40-year loans that banks or public agencies made to the builder-owners. The loans produced about 450,000 housing units.
Most of the money to repay these loans comes to the owners from the Department of Housing and Urban Development under contracts that run for 20 years. Every year Congress has to provide the funds to fulfill the contractual obligation.
As these contracts have begun to come due, Congress has been extending them for only a year, pending a comprehensive policy decision. A large wave of contracts is coming due over the next few years. Rather than renew them for 20 more years, the Clinton administration and Congress want to lower the debt on many of the properties and pay off the lenders in a bulk amount what they are owed. This would reduce the Government's annual contractual payments, which are costing the Treasury about $3.2 billion a year. It is estimated that about $1 billion in outlays a year could be saved if the portfolio were restructured to set contract rents at market levels.
How much debt to forgive, and on what properties, would depend on the "fair-market rent" that H.U.D. establishes for localities based on the rents typically charged for unsubsidized rentals in the locality. The new contract rents would have to be sufficient to cover operations and reserves, and might or might not be sufficient to support building debt. Tenants would continue to contribute 30 percent of their income to the building's operation. One key issue is how and by whom the eligibility standards would be established for vacant apartments.
To give a hypothetical example for a single apartment: The tenant has been paying $200 a month and will continue to do so. The contract rent has been $1,200 a month, so the Government has been paying $1,000. Under the proposed new system, the fair-market rent might be set at $800 a month. The Government's new annual outlay would then be only $600.
IN 1994, the average Section 8 contract rent in New York City for a two-bedroom apartment was $1,257 a month. H.U.D. estimates that the average rent paid by unsubsidized tenants for such an apartment is $817.
There is deep concern in city government and housing circles over how and by whom new contract rents will be set, and what will be the term of the renewal contracts. Another question is whether the debt restructuring will be a friendly or unfriendly issue between the Government and the borrower-owners. These owners are usually limited partnerships whose investors have been relying on and benefiting from the tax advantages of the mortgage debt. The property owners, suddenly freed of a major debt obligation, could face a significant income-tax obligation, a prospect of considerable concern to public officials.
Faced with high unexpected taxes, the partners in ownership groups may lose interest in keeping up the quality of Section 8 developments, said Barbara Udell, president of the Housing Development Corporation, housing arm of the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development. The agency administers a portfolio of 7,000 units in 67 buildings owned by private partnerships. The tenants' rent payments average only $223 a month. Almost three-quarters of the apartments are rented to the low-income elderly, the disabled or people on public assistance.
"The housing is in neighborhoods where the city has invested tens of millions of dollars," Ms. Udell said. If debt were sharply reduced or eliminated, their contract rents would perhaps be within 10 or 15 percent of fair-market rents, she said.
But would owners, faced with a huge tax liability, retain their incentive to maintain properties well? Would they allow properties to slip into deterioration and bankruptcy? "If the owner can't make ends meet with the new subsidies, the project will deteriorate," said David A. Smith, president of Recapitalization Advisors, a Boston consulting firm.
To avoid that, housing operators say that ongoing subsidies must relate to the true cost of providing decent housing -- plus providing for reserves and investor return. The fair-market rent also must be realistic in term of what tenants in the neighborhood can pay.
Housing operators also say that it makes sense to allow greater latitude in the eligibility requirements for new tenants. Since 1983, incoming tenants in Section 8 apartments have had to have incomes under 50 percent of the median for the metropolitan area, and in effect had to be either homeless or at risk of becoming so. This goal was achieved by preferences given to those who were already homeless or displaced, were paying 50 percent of their income as rent, or were living in extremely substandard housing.
"The system effectively froze out a large portion of working people who might have qualified for Section 8 housing," said Linda Field, principal in Ashton Management, which runs 400 apartments with Section 8 contracts in the South Bronx.
In any revision of the subsidy system, operators generally agree, more latitude should be allowed to owners to rent out vacant apartments to people who meet the standard formerly used for eligibility -- merely that the tenant earns no more than 80 percent of median income for the area. That would put the maximum for a family of four at about $33,000 a year.
Recent changes by the Department of Housing and Urban Development have in fact relaxed the preference rules.
On 111th Street in Harlem, Karen White, a long-term tenant leader at New West apartments, said the building was "doing excellently."
"I have suggested they put in more working people," Ms. White said. In her opinion, tenants would emerge who are able to pay $1,300 or $1,400 a month for a two-bedroom apartment.
The management company at New West apartments is N.H.P. Management, based in Washington, which operates 130,00 apartments in 38 states, including 45,000 project-based Section 8 units. Charles S. Wilkins Jr., senior vice president, noted that in many areas of low-income housing there is no decent market-rent housing with which to make comparison for the purpose of setting a fair-market rent.
Of the company's 24 developments in New York City, some would convert nicely to market-rate housing, he said. They already serve people earning $30,000 to $40,000 a year. But others will always serve a much lower-income clientele. And the level of subsidy must also provide for reserves and an adequate return to justify continued private investment.
IN 1994, operating costs averaged $9,360 per unit a year in the Housing Development Corporation's portfolio, Ms. Udell said. The implication of this high figure -- $780 a month -- is that many buildings will indefinitely be unable to afford either debt payments or taxes, although in many cases property taxes are scheduled to phase in eventually.
No Congressional action is foreseen until after the election, and it is always possible that the approach finally taken will differ from what is now being considered. Whoever is elected, however, the expectation is that the Government will write down its debt on insured Section 8 mortgages.
But direct subsidies to low-income buildings could survive, to the relief of many housing operators. "We'll sleep better at night if there continues to be project-based assistance," said Carol Lamberg, executive director of the Settlement Housing Fund.

HEADLINE: FROM THE DESK OF;
Will Congress Declare War on a Windmill?

BYLINE: By JAMES GALBRAITH and HENRY REUSS; James Galbraith teaches at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas at Austin and was a staff member of the House Banking Committee from 1975 to 1980 and the Joint Economic Committee from 1981 to 1984. Henry Reuss, a former Democratic Representative from Wisconsin, was chairman of those committees.

 BODY:
FOR 50 years, the Federal Reserve's statutory goals have been maximum employment with minimum inflation.
The Employment Act of 1946 mandated the Fed to work toward "maximum employment, production and purchasing power," and the Humphrey-Hawkins Act of 1978 restated that to "full employment and production . . . and reasonable price stability." Since the 1950's, all of the Fed chairmen -- William McChesney Martin, Arthur F. Burns, G. William Miller and Paul A. Volcker -- until the present chairman, Alan Greenspan, have explicitly accepted that these should be the goals of monetary policy, as they are the goals of the President and Congress. 
 But now Mr. Greenspan and Congressional Republicans are making it clear that they would junk this bipartisan bedrock of maximum employment and minimum inflation. The approach is embodied in legislation sponsored by Senator Connie Mack, Republican of Florida, and Representative H. James Saxton, Republican of New Jersey, leaders of the Joint Economic Committee. Bob Dole is a co-sponsor, and the approach is also endorsed by Mr. Greenspan. Senator Mack has said the Fed chairman told him that "having a primary goal of price stability is the most important thing which a central bank can contribute to a market economy."
In practice, the Mack-Saxton bill would legitimize the Federal Reserve's actual policies in recent years. Forgetting about jobs and growth, Mr. Greenspan has made his reputation by battling at Armageddon against an increasingly invisible inflation. Even though current inflation is less than half of the 5 percent average of the last 20 years (and, by Mr. Greenspan's own calculations, inflation may be considerably lower than the official figures show), the Fed still views every significant increase in jobs and growth as an excuse to tighten money and to raise interest rates.
A result has been to anesthetize the economy at perhaps several million jobs below the attainable noninflationary level. Those extra jobs could go a long way toward combating poverty, ending the downsizing of the middle class and reducing the budget deficit.
Moreover, the stock and bond markets get jittery at the release of any new economic data because they perceive that Mr. Greenspan's Federal Reserve subscribes to the quaint idea that more jobs and stronger economic growth lead inevitably to runaway inflation. This has never been true, but it is a dangerous idea as long as the Fed believes it. Long-term interest rates have been rising this year because investors realize that the Fed is not about to lower short-term interest rates, and that it may even raise them instead.
It is no wonder that the Fed, having ignored its legal obligation to pursue maximum employment, now supports having that obligation abolished.
But picture this scene under the Mack-Saxton legislation: A recession has hit, millions are jobless, thousands of businesses go bankrupt and the banking system is in crisis. The Fed chairman, serene and confident, comes before Congress to announce that, with inflation at zero, the goal of the Mack-Saxton legislation has been achieved. Members of Congress, present en masse for the occasion, rise to their feet, cheering.
If you can't imagine this scene, then you understand why this legislation is a bad idea.

HEADLINE: VIEWPOINT;
Banks Must Gird for the Test Ahead

BYLINE: By HENRY KAUFMAN; Henry Kaufman, the economist, is president of Henry Kaufman & Company, a money-management and financial and economic consulting firm.

 BODY:
AMERICAN banks have come back a long way from the financial distress of the early 1990's. In the near term, they should continue to benefit from steady economic growth, from relatively mild inflation and from an accommodating monetary policy by the Federal Reserve.
But within a year or two, this benign backdrop will be tested by questions about how the current expansion will end. When the economy turns down, many banks may discover some serious credit problems. Today, warning signs of future credit disturbances, while still faint, are becoming more visible. 
 Already, corporations are again piling up substantial debt relative to their equity bases. From 1991 through 1993, the increase in equity just about equaled the growth of corporate debt. But during the last two years or so, liabilities have risen sharply while equity has grown little.
This change in financing patterns should make bankers wary. We are still in the comfortable phase of the business cycle, with sales and profits rising. But when this economic expansion develops aches and pains, latent credit risks will again be exposed. The credit ratings of some prominent borrowers could be downgraded, especially if some recent big mergers don't work out. As a result, the ability of some companies to raise funds in the open market could drop suddenly. This would pose a challenge to commercial banks, which often serve as lenders of last resort to their key corporate clients.
Household balance sheets, meanwhile, are in pretty good shape. Although consumer borrowing has moved ahead strongly, household financial wealth has recorded truly astonishing increases. Last year alone, the financial net worth of households increased 16.5 percent, compared with an 8 percent increase in liabilities.
Much of the surge in household wealth, however, is due to greater risk-taking. During the last five years, bank deposits and money market funds have grown only slightly -- by just $250 billion, or 2 percent a year -- while investments in stocks, bonds and mutual funds have grown by nearly $4 trillion, or 20 percent a year.
The households enjoying the sharp rise in asset values are generally not the same ones that are net borrowers of new funds. For now, reasonably good income and employment prospects will continue to support increases in household credit demands. Lenders are still aggressively marketing consumer credit and housing loans. Debt levels and debt-servicing burdens, however, may be approaching their limits for many families of moderate means.
Even for those with substantial assets, the sharp rise in household financial wealth is unsustainable. As a result, a significant reversal in the stock market may well create problems that households did not encounter in earlier business cycles. The economic risk may be a greater-than-average setback in consumer spending, while the financial risk may be a greater-than-generally-expected weakening in the quality of household debt.
BESIDES these early glimmers of potential debt problems, we have to recognize that leading commercial banks, along with other prominent financial institutions, are heavily involved in the leveraging of securities. Underlying this trend is the unprecedented growth of both marketable obligations and financial derivatives, which provide additional leveraging opportunities. When banks put together combinations of interest-rate swaps, currency swaps and financial options, they help some customers deal better with risks. But they also allow other customers to create aggressive exposures.
During an economic downturn, with financial markets volatile, managing large portfolios of complex financial instruments may involve risks that are not obvious today. These risks may include unusual difficulty in putting accurate market values on these complex instruments. They may also include clearing and settlement risks, or credit risks that cannot be identified ahead of time or sorted out easily after a payments disruption.
Some banks may end up exposed to risks they had thought they had fully hedged against, only to discover that the hedge did not work. Will these dangers turn out to be as onerous as the old-fashioned credit risk that came from unwise commercial lending? That is a matter of conjecture. But banks should use meticulous care in planning for shocks that could go beyond anything they have seen before.
From the 1950's through the early 80's, credit cycles topped out when market interest rates rose above the maximum that banks and savings institutions were permitted to pay on deposits. One indirect benefit was to limit the deterioration of credit quality by thwarting the excessive credit demands of some households and businesses.
In the deregulated markets of the last decade and a half, however, credit cycles have terminated after the competition for borrowing drove up interest rates and fostered an unacceptable deterioration in credit quality.
Now, the froth that accompanies such a period of rising private-sector credit demands is heightened by various new financial instruments and complex trading, investing and lending strategies. The old cushions are gone and the markets are left to dispense credit without outside restraints.
To minimize the new risks, bankers will have to display unusual self-control. They will have to pass up many deals that look highly lucrative, at least on the surface. It may be asking a lot of the banking community to display such rectitude at a time of solid profitability and high levels of capital. But bankers should see the need to start selective disengagement from risk-taking well before events force a sudden retrenchment. There is still time for reassessing risks before market conditions turn more unfriendly.

HEADLINE: ON THE JOB;
Here Come the Ghosts of Office Gaffes Past

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER 

 BODY:
Deep into sleepless nights, what restless soul has not revisited the dread past of office nightmares, where the tongue slips, the hand betrays and the walls resound with mocking laughter? Here is consolation: To err is human, and sometimes the comedy is divine.
Some years back, when John L. Gilbert became the newest and youngest vice president of an international insurance group, he was invited to join the senior executives at their regular after-work cocktail sessions on the top floor of the Manhattan headquarters. 
 Attending his first such gathering, he moved to a group that was discussing the new crop of business school graduates that the company had hired, including one signed on by Mr. Gilbert.
Mr. Gilbert, now of Kailua, Hawaii, informed his colleagues that this bright fellow also happened to be a scratch golfer and promptly and proudly added that after this man had worked for him for a year, he expected to see his handicap in double figures. After all, anyone playing any better had to be spending so much time on the golf course that he must be neglecting business.
The company's executive vice president looked balefully at Mr. Gilbert over his martini glass and told him his handicap was six.
Terri Sapack of Manhattan assured the temp agency that yes, yes, she could handle anything. So the agency sent her on an assignment as a temporary legal secretary with a prestigious new account.
Briefed on proper dress and proper behavior, she arrived for her first day on the job. But on the crowded elevator carrying Ms. Sapack to the personnel department, the loud, incessant chatter of two women at the rear began to grate on her nerves.
Turning to display her annoyance, Ms. Sapack, an animal rights advocate, saw that one of her tormentors was swathed in fur. "Excuse me," Ms. Sapack said, "is that lynx you're wearing?"
"Why, yes, it is," the woman said, anticipating a compliment.
"What a pity," Ms. Sapack said. "That's like destroying a Rembrandt for the frame."
A few minutes later, someone from the personnel department escorted her to the office of the lawyer she would be working for: the vice president and general manager of the firm.
None other than the lynx lady herself.
On a dreary midwinter afternoon many years ago, F. Neil Horner, now of Weston, Conn., made the first sales call of his career. The prospect was the superintendent of education for a suburban St. Louis school district. Mr. Horner's objective was to sell him on the benefits of automating curriculum planning and administration for his schools.
Mr. Horner still recalls his performance. Presentation: poor. Technique: wooden and uninspired. Confidence: nil. Principal emotion: unconcealed terror.
The prospect listened politely and patiently. Mr. Horner stumbled to the end of the call, shook the man's hand, mumbled his exit lines and marched out the door, shutting it behind him.
Only then did he discover that he had marched into his prospect's coat closet.
Mr. Horner says the ensuing 30 years have been much better.
After a day's work at a company training session, a Brooklyn woman who insists on anonymity for reasons that will be soon be crystal clear was having a drink with her boss, a man, when the conversation turned to one of their colleagues.
"Yes," she said in the course of the discussion, "but it's widely rumored that she has slept with nearly everyone in the company."
Two weeks later, the Brooklyn woman learned that her boss and the woman in question had just been secretly married after dating discreetly for more than a year.
Virginia Carlson once put together a conference for academics and economic researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank in Chicago. At the kickoff luncheon, she was grateful to the senior official who delivered a gracious speech smoothing over some of the cancellations and last-minute changes on the program.
So she approached the table where he sat with his male colleagues to express her thanks. In her mind, she knew what she wanted to say: that all who knew this skilled negotiator and ruffled-feather smoother would agree that if they were ever stranded on a desert island with cannibals who did not speak the same language, he would be the one everyone would want to represent them, the man who could save the day.
But when she opened her mouth, she heard herself saying, "If I were ever on a desert island, Dave, it would be you I would want with me."
To this day, she remembers the stunned looks and her red face as she stammered her amendments. The men took it in good humor.
"But," she says, "it still remains the most embarrassing moment of my career."
Remember this: When you think you've got it bad, somebody else has it worse.
Meet Gary Milo of Brooklyn, an examiner for a regulatory agency. It's Day One of a new assignment. Because of heightened security precautions in New York City offices, he finds himself grappling with assorted access measures as he travels from company to company in the course of his work.
On this particular day, he is given a coded card to open the restroom doors, where only stick figures identify the gender of the prospective users.
Mr. Milo enters the restroom easily. But as he turns on the taps at the sink and looks into the mirror, he sees his boss, a woman, emerging from one of the stalls.
In a millisecond, Mr. Milo sees himself in big trouble.
But in another instant, the boss is speaking: "Get me out of here, quick!" she says.
Mr. Milo points to the door. The woman flees.
Mr. Milo writes, "Later, she saw the humor of the incident and told me she had wondered initially why there were urinals in a ladies room."

Explosives and Torpedoes Left Their Mark on 2 Places

BYLINE: By GEORGE GENE GUSTINES 

 BODY:

MAXIM Howell Township, Monmouth County. While studying at the Wesleyan Seminary in Kent's Hill, Me., Hudson Maxim developed a keen interest in chemistry. He began experimenting with explosives in 1888. In 1890, he built a dynamite and powder factory in the town that would become known as Maxim. There, he invented maximite, an explosive bursting powder that, when placed in torpedoes, resisted the shock of firing and the greater shock of piercing armor plate without bursting. The powder could then be set off by a delayed-action detonating fuse, which also happened to be invented by Maxim.
 
NIXON Edison, Middlesex County. First things first: it was not named for the 37th President of the United States, Richard Milhous Nixon. It was named for Lewis Nixon, a local businessman who founded the Crescent Shipyard in Elizabeth in 1885. Among the 100 vessels constructed was the Holland, the first submarine torpedo boat used by the Navy. Nixon moved to Edison in 1913. He founded the Nixon Nitration Works, which proved to be an economic boon to the town; two employees petitioned to have the area named for him. GEORGE GENE GUSTINES

Hot Towns: Summer in the City, From Salsa to Baseball

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN 

 BODY:
Burning asphalt, open hydrants, stifling buses, airless nights . . . the city in the summer has always been a place to get away from. No longer. As cities look for ways to promote civic pride and stimulate the local economy, they are offering more and more festivals and other summer attractions to bring people in.
"They are the most inexpensive form of urban renewal, because they show that people care to make their communities livable and it tells employers that those areas are worth investing in," said William La Rosa, administrator of Hudson County's Cultural and Heritage Affairs Office. 
 These events take planning, and often corporate sponsors. Many include street fairs and concerts. Here is a selection of summer activities in five cities, with information numbers.
 
Newark
(201) 733-6454
 
NEWARK FESTIVAL OF PEOPLE Returning to the PSE&G Plaza after a year's absence, this festival features three sound stages. The New Jersey Symphony Orchestra, salsa singers and jazz groups will perform. Sunday, June 30.
 
NEWARK BLACK FILM FESTIVAL In its 22d year, this festival presents free screenings of films by and about blacks, as well as lectures, at various locations. June 19 to July 31.
 
IVY HILL FOOD FESTIVAL A community event celebrating the 37 different nationalities in the Ivy Hill neighborhood. Saturday, July 13.

(609) 777-1770
 
CORESTATES CLASSIC Forget the Tour de France for a day, and watch more than 150 top American and foreign cyclists battle for more than $15,000 in prize money in a 90-mile race over a 7.5-mile loop through Trenton, cobblestones included. June 6.
 
OLYMPIC TORCH RELAY The torch passes through Trenton, stopping for a 20-minute shindig at State and Warren Streets, with live music and fireworks. Tuesday, June 18.

To the Editor:
It doesn't take a C.P.A. to recognize the horrible economic decisions made by Sarah Collins as she downloaded Jane Austen at her place of employment, in order to print her personal copy of the text of "Sense and Sensibility" ("Austen in Cyberspace," May 5). With little or no consideration of the cost of the ink cartridges used by the printer, or the cost of the paper required to copy the full text of the book, she joyously called her husband to share her "practical" decision. 
 It comes as no surprise to me that Ms. Collins is the director of a nonprofit library. Even if the library did not intend to be designated as nonprofit, there is a very good chance that the financial statements would reflect that result.

HEADLINE: BEHIND THE WHEEL/'97 Ford Escort vs. Chevrolet Cavalier and Dodge Neon;
Sizing Up the Small Cars of Detroit's Big Three

BYLINE: By MICHELLE KREBS 

DATELINE: DETROIT

 BODY:
JUST a decade and a half ago, basic transportation too often came in the form of an econobox, those cramped, noisy, underpowered automotive appliances that got from Point A to Point B, and usually made the trip seem longer than it was. And, it is fair to say, Detroit's subcompacts of that era -- remember the Chevy Chevette and the Dodge Omni? -- suffered from unremarkable designs and often shoddy quality.
Much has changed in the small-car market. Within the last two and a half years, the Big Three have introduced attractive, well-equipped contenders that are seriously competitive with foreign nameplates. The latest of these American-bred subcompacts -- that's how they are generally classified by the Government, though "compact" might be more descriptive -- are the 1997 Ford Escort and Mercury Tracer. They are going head-to-head with the Dodge/Plymouth Neon, which set new standards for the class when it made its debut in 1994, and the Chevrolet Cavalier, which improved on the Neon with a complete remake for 1995. 
 After a week of test-driving the Escort, the Cavalier and the Neon in the kind of urban-suburban driving to which these cars are often subjected, I concluded that the small Ford had moved the bar even higher.
 
FORD ESCORT: The 1997 Escort and its somewhat fancier sibling, the Mercury Tracer, went on sale on May 23, making them the newest kids on the small-car block, replacing dated models that had nonetheless continued to sell briskly.
The Escort is a significant vehicle for Ford, since it is the company's third-best seller, after the F-150 pickup and the midsize Taurus. It has been the most popular car in its class for 14 of the last 15 years.
Available now as a sedan and wagon, the Escort will add for the 1998 model year a coupe and a sporty model with a four-valve twin-cam engine. The '97 Escort line consists of the base GS and LX; the Mercury Tracer is available as the GS and LS.
Though the 1997 Escort shares many underpinnings with its predecessor -- which was itself derived from the 1991 Mazda 323 and Protege -- it is a much improved car. The styling, reminiscent of the Contour and bearing a definite, though less radical, resemblance to the Taurus, gives it a fresh look that draws attention. Two men in their 20's -- Ford's target age group for the Escort -- approached the car for a peek while I was parked at the local Dairy Queen. Both men gave a nod to the updated design. "It doesn't look cheap," one said. "It looks bigger than other small cars."
In addition to its freshened appearance, the new Escort seems more substantial than its predecessor. It is four inches longer, though the wheelbase remains the same.
The passenger compartment has been reconfigured to increase the dimensions of most concern to the driver, including front-seat headroom and legroom, though there is less rear headroom as a result. There was plenty of room for my two children and two of their friends on our ice cream expedition, but I suspect that five adults would be a snug fit. Although several interior dimensions are the smallest in this group of three, the Escort's clean and uncluttered cabin has a spacious, airy feel that makes this seem like a larger car, solid and substantial.
The Ford family resemblance is carried over to the interior. The Escort has a version of the Taurus's elliptical instrument pod, which contains the audio and climate controls. It is a feature I particularly like because its large buttons are easy to operate without taking one's eyes off the road.
The Escort is equipped with a 2-liter four-cylinder engine derived from the 1.9-liter engine of the previous Escort. But Ford engineers cranked out additional power (110 horsepower, up from 88) and more torque for better acceleration from a stop and for smoother highway cruising while improving fuel economy and lowering emissions. Even with the optional four-speed automatic, acceleration from a dead stop was acceptable, as was the car's ability to keep up with highway traffic. Handling is much improved, thanks to suspension changes and a more rigid body structure. The car maintained a firm grip on winding roads.
My main complaint with the Escort was with its keyless remote-entry system. In what appears an effort to keep costs down, Ford offers as part of an option package a "base" remote system that operates only the driver's door; the other doors have to be locked and unlocked manually. (Also available, at a higher cost, is a remote that operates all the door locks.) The test car was equipped with the driver's-side-only remote, and I kept forgetting to lock the other doors manually, or I would open the driver's door with the remote and inadvertently forget my passengers, leaving them to pound on the windows to gain admission.
In contrast to its other recently introduced models, Ford has succeeded in offering a better, well-equipped vehicle while keeping the lid on prices. A base Escort sedan starts at $11,430, including delivery charges, which is $500 less than before. The test model, equipped with an option package that included a four-speed automatic transmission, totaled $13,815.
Of the three cars -- among the base versions, at least -- I gave the Escort the highest marks. It offers good value, well-rounded performance and surprising refinement. There's little I found wanting about it.
 
CHEVROLET CAVALIER: Like the Escort, the newest version of the Cavalier bears little resemblance to the car it replaced in 1995 after 13 years with little change. The Cavalier shares a vague family resemblance with its sporty sibling, the Camaro.
Offered as a base and LS sedan, a base and LS coupe, a sporty Z24 coupe and the LS convertible, the Cavalier also feels spacious for a small car and actually has more interior volume, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, than the Escort. But inside, the Cavalier didn't feel much bigger.
This Cavalier, like the '95 model I tested last year, has one outstandingly bad feature: The front seats are painfully uncomfortable, with virtually no back support, and the rear seat is unusually slanted, presumably to create more headroom. The Cavalier's rear seat does have an advantage over the Escort's split back seat, as it conveniently pulls down in one piece and lies flat with a simple tug of a strap.
Another advantage: anti-lock brakes are standard on the Cavalier, optional on the Escort and Neon. The Cavalier also has daytime running lights, which are always lit when the car is running.
Power and acceleration from the standard 2.2-liter four-cylinder engine, rated at 120 horsepower, was adequate on the previous test car. But the '96 test model came with a new 2.4-liter, 150-horsepower twin-cam engine, optional this year on certain versions of the Cavalier. Transmission choices include a five-speed manual, a three-speed automatic (that I found imprecise in the last Cavalier I tested) or the four-speed automatic that came on the test car, a big improvement.
The tested model was a Cavalier LS sedan fully outfitted with the 2.4-liter engine and four-speed automatic transmission, traction control and power locks, mirrors and windows. It totaled out at $15,800, and was equipped better than the Escort or the Neon. But as competent as the Cavalier was, its negatives -- especially those dreadful seats -- weighed more heavily than the Escort's.
 
DODGE NEON: As with virtually every new car and truck it has introduced this decade, the Chrysler Corporation created a styling standout with its Neon, which is sold by both Dodge and Chrysler-Plymouth dealers.
While the Escort and Cavalier have headlamps shaped like cat's eyes, the bug-eye headlamps of the Neon give it a perky look. And the car, whatever its faults, has a personality of its own, in contrast to the many competent but soulless vehicles in this class.
E.P.A. figures show that the interior of the "cab forward" Neon, with the wheels pushed to the corners, is larger than the Escort's despite the Neon's shorter length.
Rated at 132 horsepower, the two-liter four-cylinder base engine of the Neon (a 150-horsepower engine is available) provides the most spirited performance of the Big Three's small cars. Rushing to an appointment, I zipped in and out of highway traffic. But along with the speed comes noise, from the engine and from the road.
And in all honesty, the Neon's quality remains an issue any prospective buyer should consider. Although problems rarely surface on new, pampered test cars, and there are few independent quality surveys, there is substantial anecdotal evidence that Neons spend an inordinate amount of time in the shop. Consumer Reports ranks the car dead last in reliability in its class.
The Neon carries the lowest base prices in the category: coupes start at $10,295 and sedans at $10,495, including delivery. The test model, equipped with options that included air-conditioning, speed control, tilt steering and the three-speed automatic transmission, topped out at $13,965.
If I were buying a car mainly to participate in weekend rally races, I'd choose the Neon. But for day-to-day commuting, I'd go with the Escort or the Cavalier.
 
INSIDE TRACK: A small step for the compact class, a giant leap for the little Ford.

A Specialist for Those Difficult Times

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY MIDDLETON 

 BODY:
THOUGH the Federal Reserve did not alter interest rates last month, bond markets are jittery. The problem is that they are not jittery enough for Robert L. Rodriguez, manager of one of the most successful bond funds of the last decade -- FPA New Income.
Despite signs of a strengthening economy, looming inflation and Washington's fading resolve to tame the deficit, long-term bond yields remain relatively low, at less than 7 percent, Mr. Rodriguez said. 
 "I am one frustrated bond manager right now," he said. "I would like to have higher yields so we get compensated for these uncertainties."
So he has taken a defensive posture in his portfolio, with a significant portion in cash and relatively short bond maturities. The stance, which has proved profitable in 1996, is particularly notable from someone who has turned in outstanding performance in the volatile bond market in recent years.
Mr. Rodriguez, 47, has consistently delivered higher total returns than his peers: an annual average of 12.18 percent, compared with 10.29 percent for the corporate bond group, since taking the helm of FPA New Income in 1984, according to Morningstar Inc., the fund analysts in Chicago. Moreover, he has been exceptionally successful in difficult markets. In 1994, when the fund's peers lost 3.6 percent on average, FPA New Income gained 1.46 percent. At the end of the week, the fund was ahead 0.92 percent for the year, while its peer group had an average loss of 2.16 percent.
FPA, a Los Angeles company, says New Income is the only bond fund not to have posted a down year since it took over management of the fund from the Transamerica Corporation in July 1984. The fund, which has $254 million in assets, carries a sales charge of 4.5 percent.
Mr. Rodriguez also runs the $400 million FPA Capital Fund, a stock fund. "It is one of the very best mutual funds," said Hal Ratner, a Morningstar analyst who follows FPA New Income, "and Mr. Rodriguez does the same kind of research on bonds that he does on the stock side."
The manager attributes his bond fund's success to a strategy he defines as contrarian and opportunistic. Depending on market conditions, he has supplemented his core holding of high-quality bonds, mostly mortgage-backed securities, with as much as 15 percent in junk bonds. Cash levels have ranged from 3 to 37 percent and the average duration -- a measure of a bond's interest-rate sensitivity -- from two to seven years.
His portfolio looks pretty conservative in those terms. Nearly 25 percent of the fund's assets are now in cash, which the fund defines as securities with a maturity of less than one year. The fund's average duration is less than four years, compared with 5.3 years for the Lehman Government bond index. With a duration of four years, the fund can be expected to lose 4 percent of its net asset value if interest rates rise 1 percentage point or to gain 4 percent if rates fall 1 percentage point.
The cash position and the duration are roughly the same as they were in September 1995, when Mr. Rodriguez wrote shareholders that the long bond was near the bottom of its range of 6.25 percent to 7.5 percent. Now, he says, it is near its midpoint, so he is still defensive. Should long-term rates move to 7.25 percent or higher, he said, he will start to buy bonds with longer maturities.
Junk bonds, the riskiest of bonds with ratings below investment grade, account for a mere 2 percent of assets. "We have virtually no investment-grade corporate bonds, either," he said, making the corporate bond designation by Morningstar a bit of a misnomer. During his tenure, the fund has kept 60 to 75 percent of its assets in bonds backed by Government agency mortgages.
The spread between corporate issues and Government issues has simply not been enough to lure him into corporate securities. With confidence high, investors generally have been willing to accept a longer maturity or lower credit quality, like corporate bonds instead of Government bonds, because their desire for higher returns outweighs their fear of higher interest rates. In Mr. Rodriguez's view, however, the real concern is the prospect of higher rates, which would erode bonds' value.
"To really be bullish about bonds," he said, "you need three crucial ingredients: sluggish economic growth, say 2.5 percent or less; inflation in the neighborhood of 2.5 percent or less; and a handle on our fiscal-policy problems, namely entitlements reform." He sees the economy growing at a somewhat higher rate, inflation already bubbling above the safe level and politicians having forsaken deficit reduction to cut unpopular taxes.
A number of unusual, and transitory, events dampened the nation's economy in 1995 and early 1996, notably a severe winter, a buildup in corporate inventories and the fallout from Mexico's currency crisis. Each of these has since abated, Mr. Rodriguez said. "My conclusion is that the odds -- and I stress odds, not a forecast -- are in favor of economic growth that will be somewhat stronger than the consensus," he said.
Inflation, he said, "has bottomed for this cycle, and it's gradually trending upward." Various measures of payroll costs -- the biggest expense for business -- show them rising at slightly more than 3 percent, he said, yet the market is pricing bonds as if inflation will remain at last year's level. "We don't think a 2.5 percent inflation rate is a sustainable number," he said.
ASIDE from raising cash and shortening duration of his portfolio, Mr. Rodriguez has placed some contrarian bets on individual securities. He recently allotted 3 percent of assets to Z bonds, a form of collateralized mortgage obligation akin to a zero-coupon note, very sensitive to changes in rates. Mr. Ratner of Morningstar said, "He has a very good grasp of these securities, and he knows how to price them."
The underlying collateral of these bonds is 8.5 percent mortgages. If rates rise, the underlying mortgages will not be refinanced. If rates fall, though, refinancings will surge, meaning the principal will be returned early.
Mr. Rodriguez said that even if rates rose, shareholders would realize annualized returns of slightly more than 8 percent. If rates were to decline and the bonds returned principal early, investors would get a much bigger kick in performance, he said.

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS;
Investing Abroad With a Conscience: It's Not Easy

BYLINE: By KEN BROWN 

 BODY:
JUST as Kathie Lee Gifford wept on her morning TV show after it became known that a line of clothing sold under her name was made by Honduran children working for pennies a day, Americans who buy mutual funds that invest in foreign markets might be appalled if they knew where their money really was going.
Depending on the fund, the money could be financing companies that are cutting the rain forests, threatening a precious habitat in Chile or using child labor. And perusing a list of the fund's holdings would probably be of little help in determining which companies are at fault. 
 Companies with records of human rights abuses, environmental problems or sweatshop conditions are difficult enough to ferret out in the United States. Getting information about companies abroad is nearly impossible, say representatives of environmental and human rights groups. Reliable information is scarce at any price, because of distance, language barriers, complicated corporate structures, lax disclosure and weak government regulations.
"It is difficult to obtain information in every instance," conceded Sophia Collier, the president of Citizens Trust in Portsmouth, N.H., which has several socially responsible funds, including one invested around the world, that attempt to avoid stocks in companies with such problems.
So investors who go to great pains to avoid domestic investments that violate their beliefs face much greater obstacles if they venture abroad. And those who don't think much about such issues now might become concerned as advocacy groups focus on exploitation of foreigners and their lands by an increasingly global investment community.
Forsaking foreign investments does not seem to be an acceptable solution for the concerned investor. The advice is chanted again and again to go international and buy stocks, bonds or mutual funds in foreign countries to spread portfolio risk and to increase long-term returns. Plenty of Americans have done just that, putting billions of dollars -- $21.9 billion this year alone -- into mutual funds that invest in everything from Indonesian paper companies to German bonds.
NO matter how careful an investor tries to be, the potential for an error is great. Pick the wrong stock or fund, and investors who care passionately about children's issues might find themselves the part owners of a company that employs 10-year-old operators of sewing machines.
Several American companies that boast of their labor records, like Reebok International and Wal-Mart Stores, have had similar unpleasant discoveries. Reebok said that last year it dismissed a contractor in Pakistan who was employing children under the age of 14. Likewise, Wal-Mart, which sells the line of Kathie Lee clothing, has recently been embarrassed by tales of child labor practices in Honduras and has said that although it has strict policies, "we can't police every factory 24 hours a day."
Among the biggest obstacles for these global corporations and for investors can be the dearth of reliable information. But the demand is growing, driven in part by individuals, but mainly by institutions with billions of dollars that want to diversify internationally while adhering to certain standards. New York City, for example, is considering putting some of its pension money in emerging markets, which have the greatest prospects for growth but whose companies' practices are also the most difficult to track. It plans to rely heavily on money managers and consultants to do the screening of companies abroad and to follow up on its own information where possible.
"There is a huge need in these markets for more research," said Barbara Samuels, a managing director at Moody's Investor Services who analyzes emerging markets.
More than $600 billion, or nearly one of every $10 under professional management in the United States, is invested using social criteria. About three dozen mutual funds consider themselves socially responsible, but only two invest internationally, according to Morningstar Inc., the fund tracking company in Chicago. None of the funds invest in emerging markets such as Malaysia and Turkey.
The two international funds for individual investors, Calvert World Values Global Equity and Citizens Global Equity Portfolio, avoid companies that build bombs or nuclear power plants and most that dig for minerals, drill for oil or cut down trees. But beyond such criteria, the funds' research is limited to phone calls and to reports from activist groups like Amnesty International, Greenpeace, Human Rights Watch and the Sierra Club, and from the media.
Many institutional investors and consulting companies said they also used such information. But the advocacy groups are mostly concerned with a country's form of government and policy issues and not with the practices of specific companies, except in high-profile cases like Shell Oil's work in Nigeria, where the military government suppressed the Ogoni minority and executed the Ogoni writer Ken Saro-Wiwa.
Tracing corporate ownership can also be difficult. Malaysian timber companies are known to be involved in cutting the rain forest in Papua New Guinea, but protesters say convoluted ownership structures and cut-and-run practices make it difficult to pinpoint responsibility.
"You can have some anecdotal information, but to have something that is complete and thorough and well-rounded is kind of beyond the state of the art right now," said J. Michael McCloskey, the chairman of the Sierra Club.
Even big companies that are generally forthcoming with business information to attract foreign money may be far from acceptable to some investors. Empresa Nacional de Electridad S.A., or Endesa, the largest electricity producer in Chile, has been criticized by environmental groups for a plan to build six dams on the Bio-Bio River, which environmentalists say would threaten endangered species and which human rights groups say would force the relocation of indigenous people. Several mutual funds, including GT Latin American Growth, Merrill Lynch Latin America and Putnam Utility Growth and Income, own stakes in Endesa.
Similarly, several Templeton funds own stakes in Windsor Industrial, a Hong Kong textile company with plants in Myanmar, whose military government is viewed as a pariah by some investors.
ANOTHER problem is whose standards to apply. "A lot of standards that are considered conventional and basic human rights in the United States are not necessarily considered the same in another country," Ms. Samuels said. "We have a clash of cultures worldwide, and global investors run right smack into it."
John H. Lickerman, the director of social research at Calvert, said his company made adjustments for other cultures. "When we look for investments in Mexico, we say right up front we can't apply U.S. standards," he said.
For example, Calvert has invested in Grupo Dina, a bus and truck manufacturer in Mexico. Mr. Lickerman said the company's facilities did not meet American environmental standards, but it had a good labor record and its buses promoted the use of mass transit. "It was a fairly tough call for us," he said.
Flexible investing criteria aside, Calvert World Values Global Equity has turned in some poor results recently, finishing in the bottom 20 percent of international stock funds for the three years ended in April, Morningstar said.
Citizens Global, which said it used consistent screening for its investments, has performed somewhat better than the Calvert fund since its beginning in 1994. In 1995, the fund returned 13.74 percent, just below the mean for world stock funds, which returned an average of 16.02 percent.
Like these two international funds, socially responsible funds that invest in the United States have generally had trouble keeping up with their domestic benchmarks, leading critics to suggest that people simply invest for the highest possible return and plow a portion of their profits into social causes instead.
One pressure on performance for socially responsible investors can be the cost of good research. For example, the one company that provides detailed environmental ratings, Eco-Rating International, charges about $30,000 for a single report on one company. Eco-Rating, a Swiss company with operations in the United States, said its clients are mostly European venture capitalists concerned about the environment, and it now provides reports on a few dozen companies.
Pressure from investors seeking greater diversification might drive down the cost of research and make it more widely available. The administrator of one of the biggest so-called socially responsible investors, New York City's public pension plan, is considering placing about $2 billion of its $60 billion in emerging markets. The plan already has about $2 billion in developed markets abroad.
"This is the wave of the future," said Patrick W. Doherty, the director of investment responsibility for the city Comptroller's office. "We have to begin to try to get a hold of monitoring on these types of issues; the difficulty can no longer deter people."
NEW YORK'S venture could help create the economies of scale that could make good research, at least on some of the bigger foreign companies, affordable.
"It is definitely sending a big ripple throughout the industry," said Simon Billenness, a senior analyst at Franklin Research and Development, the largest investment company in the United States that specializes in socially responsible investing.
If other institutional investors follow New York's lead, research on foreign markets could become better and cheaper for all, including mutual fund investors, who would get more choices.

HEADLINE: A Big Casino Wager That Hasn't Paid Off

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON 

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS

 BODY:
IT looked like a sure bet: the world's largest casino, a Las Vegas under one roof, in the heart of New Orleans, a city with 10 million tourists a year.
The prime owner of the new casino would be Harrah's Entertainment Inc., the nation's largest casino company, whose genius for cracking open new markets had made it Wall Street's darling. 
 Bourbon Street had no revels to outdo the celebrations on Wall Street over Harrah's prospects in New Orleans. The Harrah's Jazz Company, the casino partnership, sold $435 million in junk bonds in late 1994, including more than $100 million to Fidelity's mutual funds and about $46 million to Merrill Lynch's. Bankers Trust signed up as a big lender.
Harrah's raved about its prospects for bon temps. "This is a place where people go to shout and scream and have a few glasses of wine," said Colin V. Reed, executive vice president of Harrah's Entertainment. "If you look at the types of people who come here," he added, invoking his company's market research, "there is a huge propensity to game."
But today the casino, larger than a Manhattan block, sits empty and unfinished, a decaying hodgepodge of Greek Revival columns, French Second Empire towers and skeletal, exposed beams. The construction barricades and torn pavement that were supposed to be temporary inconveniences when construction began in January 1995 have come to seem permanent.
Last November, the $823 million Harrah's Jazz casino filed for bankruptcy protection. Thousands of wage earners, including state and local government employees, construction workers and the staff of a temporary Harrah's casino across the French Quarter, were abruptly laid off. With the bonds recently trading at 40 cents on the dollar, bondholders, including the Fidelity and Merrill investment funds, have lost about $260 million.
Harrah's faces a June 10 deadline for winning tentative approval of a reorganization plan that would give bondholders 50.1 percent ownership and control. The company is seeking an extension to persuade the city and state, its creditors and a bankruptcy judge to let it break its commitments, chopping the new casino's size and lowering the company's tax obligations by about half.
Mr. Reed's social life has lately amounted to endless rounds of meetings with vengeful bondholders and outraged politicians. "I've lost a lot of hair in the last year and a half," he said.
The experience of New Orleans, the nation's largest city to welcome casinos, holds lessons for the many other cities considering projects of their own. Casino developers and politicians in Miami, Detroit, Philadelphia and Chicago all have plans. In New York City, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has considered, but not decided on, a plan by Mirage Resorts and New York Cruise Lines, the parent company of Circle Line Sightseeing Yachts, to launch casino cruise ships from Staten Island. Gambling would begin once they reached international waters, where it is legal.
"I think a lot of cities throughout North America ought to pause and take a good look at what happened in New Orleans," said Chris Hemmeter, Harrah's major partner here. "If they are going to pursue the gaming industry, they are going to have to adjust their outlook."
The chief lesson is that the turnout in an untested urban market can be wildly overestimated. Harrah's won government approval for its casino with extravagant projections of revenues and tax payments -- numbers certified by investment bankers, accountants and state officials.
The company promised to turn New Orleans visitors into gamblers -- and the nation's gamblers, who usually flock to Las Vegas, into visitors. But instead of enticing more tourists, the temporary Harrah's casino that opened a year ago depended primarily on local folk. Wagering amounted to only 40 percent of what Harrah's expected. "If you're picking local people's pockets, you can't call it economic development," said Robert Goodman of Hampshire College, an authority on the gambling industry who had predicted the project would come up short.
Casino executives and especially politicians also learned in New Orleans that less is sometimes more. Rather than letting several companies test the market with smaller casinos, as Mississippi did with great success, officials in Louisiana licensed a single huge project, anticipating higher tax revenues as a result.
In April, the State Legislature, once filled with gambling proponents, gave Louisiana's parishes, or counties, the right to vote this November on whether to stop gambling operations within their boundaries. New Orleans voters could bring the Harrah's project to a permanent halt.
WHILE Louisiana could become the first state to uproot its casinos and video poker machines, gambling is having a hard time advancing in many other states. The seemingly inevitable spread of gambling, from two states eight years ago to 24 today, has slowed. Only two states have legalized gambling since the beginning of 1994. In 22 others that have faced the issue, voters, lawmakers or the courts have refused to do so. Industry lobbyists no longer predict that almost every state will have casinos by the turn of the century.
No casino company has greater stakes in the expansion of gambling -- a $482 billion industry -- than Harrah's Entertainment, based in Memphis. Since its fiasco here, Harrah's, with revenues of $1.55 billion in 1995, is less admired than some rivals, like Mirage Resorts, that have concentrated on Las Vegas. "The spread of gaming was very much a part of how this company built its business plan," said Jason Ader, an analyst at Bear Stearns. "Now they have this scar, they have this taint of New Orleans associated with them. The growth opportunities for Harrah's are more limited."
Harrah's executives, blaming their woes here on conditions set by the famously colorful state and local politicians, say they are having much more luck elsewhere. As the first major casino company to venture outside Nevada and New Jersey, the first to penetrate Illinois, Mississippi and Kansas City, Mo., Harrah's says its $120 million-plus loss in New Orleans has not slowed its growth.
THE Harrah's case is hardly the first to sour Louisianans on gambling. By the time the Harrah's Jazz project crashed, two New Orleans river boat casinos, including one owned by Mr. Hemmeter, had already filed for bankruptcy protection. In the state's newly legalized video poker industry, several organized-crime figures have been convicted of Federal offenses. Last month, a powerful state senator pleaded guilty to illegally aiding a video poker machine company that mobsters reputedly control.
Now, Louisianans suffer in the knowledge that most serious gamblers follow the billboards straight from the New Orleans airport to the Gulf Coast in Mississippi. There lies as much casino space as in Atlantic City, the product of far less political intrusion and a much more modest start. And the Mississippi coast, unlike New Orleans, began with no other tourist attractions besides some sparsely visited beaches.
Even there, arguments continue over whether gambling's economic advantages are worth the rise in crime, bankruptcies and compulsive wagering. But in the case of Harrah's, Louisiana and New Orleans now don't even have tax revenues or jobs.
The casino's initial attractions were obvious. State and local officials, strapped for cash, gambled that the casino would bring relief, and budgeted accordingly. The state, near the bottom in virtually every indicator of wealth and education, desperately needed to offset revenue losses from the oil and gas industries. Harrah's Jazz promised to pay the state at least $100 million a year. The city expected $23 million.
Although Louisiana law expressly forbade gambling, state lawmakers, flush with campaign donations from the casino industry, finessed the point in the late 1980's by defining gambling on river boats as "gaming." By last year, the New Orleans area had four river boats, with several others around the state.
Mr. Hemmeter, a hotel developer from Los Angeles, had much greater casino projects in mind than his New Orleans river boat, however. In 1992, he helped persuade the Legislature to permit a single casino based on land. The next year, the city granted him and Caesars World a lease on its Rivergate Convention Center site next to the French Quarter, in the middle of the hotel district, where Canal Street approaches the Mississippi River.
Mr. Hemmeter, proposing to tear down the Rivergate and build a grand new gambling palace, beat out a rival bid by Harrah's, which initially wanted to just renovate the existing building.
Despite Mr. Hemmeter's head start, Harrah's was not about to quit. In August 1993, after intense lobbying, the State Casino Board, by a 5-to-4 vote, awarded Harrah's, not Mr. Hemmeter, the sole license for the casino.
Harrah's had the license, but Mr. Hemmeter still held the lease. The prospect that their deadlock might leave New Orleans with no casino at all mightily displeased Edwin Edwards, then the state's Governor. Gambling was one of the many pleasures Mr. Edwards never hid. He once boasted of winning $300,000 on a Las Vegas trip.
The Governor commanded Harrah's and Mr. Hemmeter to form a partnership, with some other local investors thrown in. "We were dragged off to Baton Rouge for a shotgun marriage," said Mr. Reed of Harrah's.
Harrah's went along with the Hemmeter vision: first, a temporary casino, in the old municipal auditorium, then a permanent casino at the Rivergate site -- with 200,000 square feet, larger than anything in Las Vegas.
Most of the financing required other people's money. The partners planned to kick in $170 million, or less than $1 for every $3 borrowed. They arranged to borrow as much as $175 million from Bankers Trust and $435 million from the buyers of first-mortgage notes -- essentially, junk bonds that paid 14.25 percent interest plus a share of the casino's cash flow. The temporary casino was supposed to provide the rest of the construction money.
The temporary casino, which was to operate until the permanent one was ready, opened on May 1 last year. A week later, the gambling floor was under water, in the city's worst flood in 30 years.
Harrah's public relations gaffes have compounded the bad luck. For many proud residents, no episode was so emblematic as the company's confrontation with Joan of Arc, the Maid of Orleans and the city's patron saint.
A gilded statue of her astride her horse, holding her banner high, has become a beloved landmark. Problem was, Harrah's Jazz planned a wide driveway for buses right over the same spot. One day late in 1994, frantic callers told preservationists and politicians that the company's bulldozers were ramming over trees around the statue's plaza, in preparation for moving the statue itself. "It was symbolic of how the casino interests have pushed their way into the city," said James R. Logan 4th, president of the Louisiana Landmarks Society.
The landmarks group got an immediate court order to halt the bulldozers. Early last year, the courts ruled that because this was Federal property, only the Secretary of the Interior could budge Saint Joan for the buses. The Secretary and the saint both stood their ground. Mr. Reed put the cost of delaying the whole project and redesigning the entrance at $30 million or more, not counting loss of face.
SOON, however, Harrah's Jazz had even more costly worries. To obtain its license, Harrah's had assured state and local officials that visitors would wager $33 million a month at the temporary casino, with 25 percent of the take going to the state. But actual wagering averaged only $13.1 million a month.
"Somebody miscalculated; maybe a lot of somebodies miscalculated," said Timothy P. Ryan, dean of the University of New Orleans College of Business Administration. "It's not a case of 'build it and they will come.' "
Sixty percent of the casino customers were local. The tourists Harrah's expected never showed up. Even New Orleans residents wanted to work in the casino -- the pay and benefits were attractive -- but not necessarily gamble there. It didn't help that the temporary casino was right across the street from a housing project.
Soon, analysts were challenging Harrah's projections for its permanent casino. The value of the bonds began falling. From early September to mid-November, Harrah's stock fell from $33.125 to $22.125.
Not that Harrah's Jazz would publicly acknowledge any doubts. Having already spent more than $600 million fixing up the temporary casino and building the permanent one, the company went on the offensive. "Harrah's New Orleans Is Here to Stay. Bet on It," said full-page newspaper ads last Nov. 20. Denying reports of financial troubles or bankruptcy preparations, the ads noted that Harrah's Entertainment had provided a written completion guarantee.
At about 3 A.M. on the day before Thanksgiving, two days later, the gambling and the construction stopped. Harrah's Jazz let go about 1,600 construction workers and 2,500 casino employees, and filed for bankruptcy protection.
Tax payments to the state and city also stopped. Both the city, days from passing its budget, and the state cut hundreds of jobs. Harrah's Entertainment contended that, because Bankers Trust, the project's primary bank lender, had canceled its $175 million commitment, the completion guarantee had lapsed.
Harrah's Jazz antagonists called the bankruptcy filing last Nov. 22 a stratagem to escape the company's commitments to finish the casino and pay the promised taxes. "I still have a great sense of bitterness," said New Orleans's Mayor, Marc Morial. "Why shut it down? And at 3 A.M.?"
Bondholders, led by Fidelity, claimed the right to take control, as the bankruptcy reorganization will probably allow them to do. The bondholders have pressured Harrah's for favorable terms by asking Hilton Hotels and the ITT Corporation's Caesars World to consider taking over the project.
SOME analysts say that even the reorganization plan is too rosy. Having initially forecast that the new casino would take in $600 million annually, Harrah's says that a scaled-back project can still reap $300 million to $350 million the first year and $450 million the second. The company argues that a gleaming new casino, safe and convenient to the major hotels, can still prove to be a powerful tourist draw.
While Harrah's Jazz bonds were still trading at a sharp discount last week, Harrah's Entertainment stock has recovered, on takeover speculation and continued expansion elsewhere. It closed Friday at $33.625.
Meanwhile, instead of having the world's largest casino, New Orleans has the world's largest tombstone to the gambling industry's ambitions.
The casino was to include five vast courtyards, each with its own theme, ranging from the Mardi Gras Court, its florid decor borrowed from the annual parades and the city's ancient clubs, or krewes, to the Smugglers Court, a historical tribute to crooks who operated at sea.
Visualizing this right now takes some imagination. From the outside, it is tough to tell whether the building is going up or coming down. One end boasts classical columns, cornices and a pediment. The other is all scaffolding, girders and beams.
Having decided to cut back the casino space, Harrah's Jazz and the city are hunting for other tenants -- perhaps a jazz museum. Creditors are refusing to restore financing until after the November vote, delaying the casino's completion until at least the middle of next year.
If Orleans Parish voters withdraw permission, Harrah's Jazz might never obtain the needed cash. The company has already threatened to challenge the referendum and defend its 30-year casino license in court.
With plans for a gradual opening, in stages, and more modest ambitions, Harrah's executives say they can win the vote and finally salvage the project.
"A high-quality casino in that location has still never been tested," said Mr. Reed of Harrah's. "When that casino opens, it will be a financial success for us and the city and the state."

When gaming was approved, it was hoped that New Orleans's significant tourist trade would provide the high rollers, but the take at a temporary casino set up by Harrah's has largely come from local pockets.

 BODY:

CHINA RELATIONS
 
Ex-Im Bank Won't Back Dam
Accepting a recommendation from the Clinton Administration, the Export-Import Bank refused to finance a large dam in China that is planned as the centerpiece of the country's hydroelectric system. The Administration and the bank expressed concern about the environmental impact of the Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River. American companies are free to pursue contracts on the $25 billion project, but without Washington-subsidized loans. Caterpillar, Rotec and other companies with high expectations for the project expressed dismay.
 
TRADE
 
Warnings on Cuba
In a move unlikely to please many of its allies, the United States notified some companies in Canada, Mexico and Italy that they might face American punishment because their operations in Cuba are based on properties confiscated from American companies. In March, Congress authorized sanctions, including denying visas to corporate officers and shareholders.
 
INVESTING
 
Rolling the Dice
Reversing a trend of recent months, more Americans are putting their mutual-fund money into aggressive growth, the riskiest category. Aggressive-growth funds took in more than a third of the $20.6 billion that domestic stock funds recorded in April, the Investment Company Institute reported, up from 29 percent in March.
 
TAXES
 
Born-Again Supply Siders
They're steering away from the "supply side" label of the 1980's, because of the widely held perception that the tax cuts of that decade contributed to the huge increase in the nation's deficit. And most of them no longer argue that tax cuts pay for themselves by generating economic growth. But Republican theorists who believe that large tax cuts are needed are pushing to the fore, taking center stage from G.O.P. deficit-cutters. But to what extent they will shape Bob Dole's campaign strategy remains uncertain.
 
THE ECONOMY
 
Inflation Jitters, Again
The week's economic reports, including new-home sales and jobs creation, pointed to stronger growth in the second quarter, and that set off inflation early warning systems around the country. Some people looked ahead to Aug. 20, when the Federal Reserve holds its midsummer meeting, as a time when monetary policy might tighten.
 
POLLUTION
 
Huddled Masses, Yearning To Breathe Free
As the debate continues over how best to regulate toxic air pollutants, the Environmental Proection Agency and a number of companies are close to agreement on a contract under which the companies will put into effect their own pollution-control plans, free of existing Government rules, so long as the result surpasses current environmental standards. Among the participants are Intel, Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing and Hadco, which makes circuit boards.
 
LABOR
 
You Have Nothing To Lose but Your Chains
Fearful that the growth of managed care has eroded their control over working conditions and treatments as well as incomes, some doctors are contemplating enlistment in the ranks of organized labor. Among the nation's nearly 700,000 medical doctors, only a handful have organized, but in Florida and California, two hotbeds of managed care, organizers expect a wave of disgruntled physicians to sign up with affiliates of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.
 
LABOR (II)
 
Harvest of Peace
At the other end of the pay scale, one of the nation's longest-running labor disputes was settled in the Salinas Valley of California as the United Farm Workers reached agreement with Bruce Church Inc., one of the largest lettuce growers. The pact calls for a minimum wage of $6.62 an hour in the first year, rising to a minimum of $7.23 by the fifth year.

HEALTH CARE
 
New Jersey Blue Cross Merges
Adding financial muscle to compete with the nation's managed-care companies, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of New Jersey agreed to merge with Anthem Inc., a large Midwestern insurer. The new company hopes to grow even bigger by acquiring some of the other two dozen managed-care companies in the state.
 
BROADCASTING
 
If It Ain't Broke, Break It
Fox is shifting its wildly popular "X-Files" to Sunday night from Friday; CBS is moving its "Touched by an Angel" to Sunday from Saturday, and those are only the most striking changes in the networks' fall lineups. In all, nearly 60 percent of the lineups involve new or moved programs. What's driving all the changes? Some CBS executives say that for the first time they are counterprogramming against cable television as well as their traditional rivals.
 
LEADERS
 
Jerry R. Junkins, 58
Rising from the factory floor at Texas Instruments to the chairman's seat, Jerry R. Junkins turned around an ailing chip maker and demonstrated that American companies did not need to abandon memory-chip making to the Japanese. Under his leadership the company's sales rose to $7.8 billion last year from $2.7 billion in 1990. Mr. Junkins was an active lobbyist for free trade in corporate and government circles and in 1994 served as head of the Alliance for GATT -- now a lobbying group. Mr. Junkins died on Wednesday after suffering a heart attack while visiting customers in Stuttgart, Germany.

HEADLINE: Insuring Mental Health Has Been Cost-Efficient

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your call for a commission to study insurance coverage for mental illness ("Mr. Dole's Health-Care Task," editorial, May 30) is not a compromise, it's a cop-out. 
 The Senate Committee on Appropriations commissioned one study during the first attempt at health-care reform in 1993. By releasing this issue to a commission, Congress would continue to perpetuate discrimination against five million Americans whose illness affects the wrong part of the body -- the brain.
Concern that providing this coverage would create "major economic problems" is not supported by data. In Rhode Island, Maine and New Hampshire, which have parity for severe mental illnesses, costs have risen only modestly. In states where parity laws existed, 66,000 new jobs were created in a year.

The Return of the City-State

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS

 BODY:
IN antiquity, before the rise of powerful nation-states, there were city-states whose names identified a civilization -- Athens, Edo, Rome and Alexandria among them. Some experts are now suggesting that in the future, cities, and not nations, will once again define who we are and how we live.
The new megalopolises are not the city-states of old, with their largely homogeneous populations and restricted views of citizenship. Today they are vast, polyglot and sprawling. Richard Sennett of New York University, who has written extensively on urban life, calls them "cities without a center or an edge." 
 But like the cities of old, they are gateways to the rest of the world. New York is perhaps the archetype -- a city that even in the 19th century was still cultivating its own personality, partly drawn from the immigrants and international traders. Today such cities flourish all over the world -- connected by a global economy, computerized communications, easy air travel, shared tastes in fashions, food, music and film. At some moments, their ties to each other seem to transcend their ties to their own rural hinterlands. And English in all its zany varieties is rapidly becoming the common trade language of their mobile populations.
A large population, however, hardly guarantees an easy future; in most cases too many people strain mass transportation and food supplies. United Nations projections show that by 2015, metropolitan Bombay will have 27 million people; Lagos 24 million; Shanghai 23.5 million; Jakarta 21 million; Mexico City 18.7 million; Beijing and Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, about 19 million each, and Cairo 14.5 million. In the first quarter of the next century, these cities will grow five times faster than metropolitan areas in the developed nations, where populations are often leveling off or declining.
Regardless of size, many of these cities are drifting away from their national moorings, establishing their own political, economic and diplomatic identities. Take Seattle, which fascinates Wally N'Dow of Gambia, who will preside over Habitat II, which is the second United Nations conference on urbanization in 20 years. It opens in Istanbul tomorrow.
 
 
 
Birds Alighting
 "Seattle is no longer just an American city," Mr. N'Dow said in an interview in his United Nations office. "It belongs to Canada. It also belongs to the Pacific Rim. It belongs to Asia in ways that are real -- in economic, financial ways, in commerce and the diplomacy of commerce." Much the same could be said of Vancouver, with its ties to the Pacific, or Miami, with its ties to Latin America.
Success or failure in a global economy is directly linked to the efficiency of cities, says Mr. N'Dow, who takes that message to the urban centers in poor countries. "When cities function, investment comes in," he said. "When there is peace, social cohesiveness, a good transportation structure and communications, the bird of investment will alight on that city. The minute that city misfunctions, that bird will pick up and fly away again. The economy will never function -- no matter what the leadership, no matter how much in resources they have -- if the city is not functioning."
After a recent tour of shantytowns and downtowns in poor African and Asian countries Robert D. Kaplan, the author of the recently published book "The Ends of the Earth" (Random House) returned pessimistic about the ability of cities in the third world to prosper under the weight of overwhelming population growth. They soon become "public relations nightmares" for the countries they come to symbolize, Mr. Kaplan said.
"Show me a place where urbanization rates are high," he said, pointing particularly to sub-Saharan Africa and the Arab world, "and I'll show you a place where everything else is bad. The countries that are really configured well for the 21st century are places like Germany, which has always had a tradition of a lot of regional cities."
China would like to emulate Germany's pattern, says Mr. N'Dow. Its planners want to create up to 500 smaller urban centers as a means of taking pressure off both people and resources like food and water.
Mr. Sennett, who attended the first Habitat conference two decades ago, now thinks the concept of the city has changed significantly. It has supplanted ideas on the place of the countryside in national life, particularly in the poorer nations with colonial pasts.
"What struck me then at the first conference was this concern for balancing the countryside and the city among planners in the developing parts of the world," Mr. Sennett said. "Today that's a kind of nostalgic hope, not a possible hope, because people are leaving the countryside rapidly, especially in the third world, and rural development has become very industrial, part of the global economy." Food-processing factories are now built in the fields and vegetables grown in the slums of tropical nations.
"The hatred of the city as a colonial place was very strong among planners 20 years ago," Mr. Sennett said. "It was evident in the Cultural Revolution in China. The Khmer Rouge is another good example: send them out of the cities, depopulate the cities; that's how you start over. In a nicer way, a sweeter way, democratic planners had the same thought."
The cities fought back and won, however. So much so, said Mr. Sennett, that city citizenship is becoming more important than allegiance to a nation. But, he asks, what kind of citizen, what kind of society will evolve in vast, choked, polluted, urban conglomerations more populous than most countries and less beholden than ever to old boundaries? "How do you make a citizen -- create a sense of being a citizen and belonging to a place -- when it's this kind of smush of territory?"

Joseph Mitchell's Oral Histories, in Writing

 BODY:
JOSEPH MITCHELL, who died on May 24 at the age of 87, wrote a series of pieces for The New Yorker magazine about one Joe Gould, who went around town telling people he was writing "An Oral History of Our Times" which ran on for millions of words.
As it turned out, Mr. Gould's book existed only in his own mind. But Mr. Mitchell's careful listening and elegant writing -- about New York haunts, and the characters who haunted them -- made his magazine pieces oral histories in their own right. 
 Here is a short selection, culled from "Up in the Old Hotel" (Pantheon, 1992):

"MCSORLEY'S WONDERFUL SALOON" (1940)
Most nights there are a few curiosity-seekers in the place. If they behave themselves and don't ask too many questions, they are tolerated. The majority of them have learned about the saloon through John Sloan's paintings . . . . To a stranger, attracted to the saloon by a Sloan painting, Kelly will say, "Hey, Mac, if you want to see some real art, go look at the naked lady in the back room." The nude is stretched out on a couch and is playing with a parrot; the painting is a copy, probably done by a Cooper Union student, of Gustave Courbet's "La Femme au Perroquet." Kelly always translates this for strangers. "It's French," he says learnedly. "It means 'Duh Goil and duh Polly.' "
McSorley's bar is short, accommodating approximately ten elbows, and is shored up with iron pipes . . . Down the middle of the room is a row of battered tables. Their tops are always sticky with spilled ale. In the centre of the room stands the belly stove, which has an isinglass door and is exactly like the stoves in Elevated stations. All winter Kelly keeps it red hot. "Warmer you get, drunker you get," he says.

"THE BOTTOM OF THE HARBOR" (1951)
On some beds, the clams are crowded as tightly together as cobblestones. They are lovely clams -- the inner lips of their shells have a lustrous violet border, and their meats are as pink and plump as rosebuds -- but they are unsafe; they sometimes contain the germs of a variety of human diseases, among them bacillary and protozoal dysentery and typhoid fever, that they collect in their systems while straining nourishment out of the dirty water . . . Quite a few people in waterfront neighborhoods in Staten Island, Brooklyn, and Queens have never been fully convinced that the clams are unsafe. On moonless nights and foggy days, they slip out, usually in rowboats, and raid the beds. In the course of a year, they take tons of clams. They eat them in chowders and stews, and they eat them raw. Every once in a while, whole families get horribly sick.

"JOE GOULD'S SECRET" (1964)
Joe Gould was an odd and penniless and unemployable little man who came to the city in 1916 and ducked and dodged and held on as hard as he could for over thirty-five years. He was a member of one of the oldest families in New England ("The Goulds were the Goulds," he used to say, "when the Cabots and the Lowells were clamdiggers"), he was born and brought up in a town near Boston in which his father was a leading citizen, and he went to Harvard, as did his father and grandfather before him, but he claimed that until he arrived in New York City he had always felt out of place. "In my home town," he once wrote, "I never felt at home. In New York City, especially in Greenwich Village, down among the cranks and the misfits and the one-lungers and the has-beens and the might've-beens and the would-bes and the never-wills and the God-knows-whats, I have always felt at home."
Gould looked like a bum and lived like a bum. He wore castoff clothes, and he slept in flophouses or in the cheapest rooms in cheap hotels. Sometimes he slept in doorways. He spent most of his time hanging out in diners and cafeterias and barrooms in the Village or wandering around the streets or looking up friends and acquaintances all over town or sitting in public libraries scribbling in dime-store composition books. He was generally pretty dirty. He would often go go for days without washing his face and hands, and he rarely had a shirt washed or a suit cleaned. As a rule, he wore a garment continuously until someone gave him a new one, whereupon he threw the old one away. He had his hair cut infrequently ("Every other Easter," he would say), and then in a barber college on the Bowery. He was a chronic sufferer from the highly contagious kind of conjunctivitis that is known as pinkeye. His voice was distractingly nasal. On occasion, he stole. He usually stole books from bookstores and sold them to second-hand bookstores, but if he was sufficiently hard-pressed he stole from friends.

Where Strange Dogs Roam and Cars Go to Die

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS 

 BODY:
WILLETS POINT Industrial Park, it could be said, is one continuous accident.
Its geography is that of a crater, formed by various urban unnatural acts into a vague triangle edged with jettisoned tires, chemical drums and vinyl-covered passenger seats. Its chief industry is car repair, and evidence of four-wheeled mortality rolls in every minute: the dented, dowdy minivan; the squealing, hard-driven import with the punched-out lights; the flattened onetime sports coupe. There is the occasional motorboat, propped on a trailer, and caravans of cars just passing through, including a bright yellow school bus and a taxicab with its light on. Chance dog pairings have produced strange-gaited mongrels that pad silently along the street. Jets streak back and forth overhead, the No. 7 train rumbles to the south, and the Van Wyck Expressway roars to the east like some gasoline-fed sea. 
 It seems like the end of the world. To walk here is a life-threatening exercise, a crunching along on shattered glass and shards of chrome, enveloped by clouds of dust and sand and grit. One must dodge cars approaching from numerous directions, triple-parked trucks, a whimsically planted coco-helado vendor, a man in a tight white T-shirt pushing a grocery cart loaded with tailpipes and bits of paneling, someone else inquiring whether you have come in search of parts, and an idling forklift, its driver nowhere to be seen, from which a half-stripped dark-blue Chevy -- a Celebrity -- dangles from a height.
Yet somehow the place strings along in perpetuity, despite repeated threats on its life by developers' dreams and the great municipal juggernaut known as eminent domain. There was the plan to build the 1964 World's Fair, as well as Shea Stadium, which went up nearby with the help of a lawyer named Mario Cuomo, who was hired by the local property owners. There was the idea of a domed football stadium in 1984, endorsed by the city and underwritten, until it got too complicated, by Donald Trump. Three years ago, the Borough President's office put out two development plans for the area, which it said would "transform the site's appearance into one which befits its location," namely with lots of commercial activity.
And most recently there has been a proposal for a new baseball stadium for the Mets, along with a massive entertainment complex that would gobble up Willets Point as we know it. But last month, the entertainment complex part of the idea was quietly reeled in.
Still, that doesn't mean the people who daily do business there rest easy. Sardar John, the owner of Kabul Auto Repair, fears that a move could cut into the profitable business he started six years ago. It was then that he, his wife and their eldest son, smuggled out of Afghanistan by mujahedeen in 1979, arrived in New York. "If they take my place, I lose my business," Mr. John said, his brow wrinkling. He now has four children and his wife to support. "I take care of my family," he said.
Despite the city taxes he and other business people pay, there are no sidewalks here, nor storm drains nor sewer pipes. There is no line painted down the middle of the main street, the pretentiously titled Willets Point Boulevard, envisioned by early 20th-century planners as a grand concourse across the borough. (The flourish ends abruptly after a half-dozen despondent blocks, although it resurfaces about a mile away, near Flushing Airport.) When Hollywood decided in 1994 to make a movie, "Kiss of Death," about a sordid world of car theft, gunfire and general brutishness, its craftsmen came to Willets Point to do six weeks' worth of filming.
On the northern fringes of the boulevard, in a pseudo-Georgian red-brick warehouse, Anne Fodera Rosengarten says she worries constantly about the future of the Fodera Food Company, a bakery supplier started by her grandfather, which moved to the neighborhood 23 years ago.
"This is such a wonderful location for distribution, and it's perfect for what we do," said Mrs. Rosengarten, the treasurer of the Willets Point Property Owners Association, an organization that takes credit for having held off development. "But it's difficult for us to make efficient, valid business decisions. How do you make a plan if you don't know if you'll be here in five years?"
She said that the property owners in Willets Point were usually the last to hear about plans to alter it, and that her organization represents but a handful of the businesses, which have turned over, subdivided and been assumed by immigrants from every corner of the globe. She has been struggling to rent a building she owns there. "I've lost three or four prospective tenants," she said, "because they look out of the window and they don't like what they see."
The local community board, Board 7, says that although there is a steady hue and cry from Willets Point, nothing seems to improve. "It's been a problem for at least the last 15 years," said Regina Colletta, the district manager. "They're paying taxes but they don't have streets to speak of. All of them are flooded very badly. There's no sewer system to speak of." She was called recently about a section of a side street that reportedly had been closed off by someone to use for auto repair. She drove over to look at it, she said, became overwhelmed by water lapping at the sides of her car and left without ever finding the street in question.
There are others here who think change could be a relief. Everyone complains about the potholes, the floods that follow every rainfall and the general disrepair that prevails, quite apart from that of the automobiles in their midst. There are mutterings about petty crime, about illegal businesses, about people secretly living in one or more of the scrap yards.
"There's too much competition, too many garages that open," said Jorge Tirado, a Colombian who launched Joy Auto Repair in 1987. His palms black with grease, he said he had made just $25 in a long, hot day of work. "We pay taxes here, and get nothing," he said. "It's better to move. It's too expensive here." He pays $3,000 a month for his 4,000-square-foot garage, he said. He has no hot water, no heat. He has to go home to use the bathroom, he said, or run to the yard behind his garage.
It is decidedly a community in transition. When Richard Musick, president of the property owners' association, still worked here at the Exxon station his father owned, lunch was a hamburger from Joseph's, a diner. Now people also flock to the Embassy, a cafe operated by Alirio Ortiz, who is from Colombia and sells chunks of yucca, chorizo sandwiches and avena fria, a drink made of oatmeal and milk served on the rocks.
Willets Point began as a salt marsh. Its present form owes itself to ashes, poured into the damp and immortalized by F. Scott Fitzgerald as the smoking, depressing "valley of ashes" where Tom Buchanan's mistress lived (over a garage) in "The Great Gatsby," said Vincent Seyfried, vice president of the Queens Historical Society. A layer of garbage followed, then a business or two. When the Jets played at Shea, fans used to pack Joseph's bar on Sundays, and people found extra work parking cars during football games and the U.S. Open tennis matches, Mr. Musick said.
Today no one seems to know how many businesses are operating there, and certainly the garbage seems out of control, too. "It's like the Wild West out here," said one man, who gave his name only as Jerry. Many of the auto-repair places are legal, while others spring up and disappear almost overnight.
"We had all kinds of ethnic groups then," Mr. Musick said, recalling the salad days of Willets Point, circa 1985, "but back in those days, people were here most of their lives. They spoke English. They toed the line. Changing a windshield in the middle of the street was unheard of then."
As for getting some infrastructure improvements anytime soon, it's improbable, Ms. Colletta said. A 1993 report estimated the cost of putting in streets, curbs and a sewer system at $25 million to $35 million, she said. "The cost is so tremendous that to support it the city would need development in there," she said. And if the past is any guide, that isn't likely to happen.

HEADLINE: Looking for Volunteers;
Yeltsin's American-Style Army

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: MOSCOW

 BODY:
IT was the political equivalent of a sneak attack. With virtually no warning, President Boris N. Yeltsin this month stunned his opponents in the presidential election campaign, and many in Russia's armed forces, by announcing that conscription would be abolished by the year 2000.
Though less dramatic than his signing of a cease-fire last week in the unpopular and grinding war in Chechnya, Mr. Yeltsin's promise potentially has far-reaching consequences: Russia's much-vaunted military tradition would be put aside, and its maligned, cash-strapped but still sizable armed forces would become an all-volunteer military. 
 Coupled with his order that Russian soldiers no longer be sent to trouble spots without their permission, Mr. Yeltsin's move looked like a brazen ploy to exploit the war-weariness of Russians at the polls two weeks from today; the President himself, after all, contributed to the malaise by starting the Chechen war in the first place. But he has put the complex question of the Russian national character on the table in a politically shrewd way.
Seeking to outflank his nationalist opponents and hard-line generals, who extol the virtues of selfless service to the state and say Russia needs a large force of conscripts, Mr. Yeltsin is instead appealing to anxious, draft-age Russian youth and their parents, who care less about losing Russian glory than losing Russian lives in support of costly, embarrassing adventures in Chechnya, Afghanistan and elsewhere.
"This move is not supported broadly by the generals," said Alexei Arbatov, a military expert with the liberal Yabloko party and member of Parliament. Rather, he said, "this move is directed at the youth."
The Communists, playing to Russia's military-industrial complex, have assailed Mr. Yeltsin's moves, though this appears to have done him little good with the voters.
But many Western experts and Russian reformers believe a professional Russian army is long overdue.
The American military underwent a transition to professional armed forces after the Vietnam war. Senior American officers say a well-trained cohort of volunteers is best suited for the increasingly complex challenges of high-tech warfare.
France, where obligatory military service dates to the days of the French Revolution, recently announced that it was ending conscription, saying it would reduce its 500,000-member military to an all-volunteer force of 350,000 by 2002.
In the aftermath of the cold war, Russia's military, once more than five million strong, has been reduced to 1.7 million, according to official Russian figures (some Western experts say the real number may be closer to 1.2 million).
With most conscripts declining to re-enlist after their mandatory two-year tours are up, the Russian military has found it difficult to retain qualified and experienced soldiers -- a serious liability contributing to its embarrassing setbacks in Chechnya. It has supplemented the use of conscripts by signing contracts with 270,000 volunteers, but they are often poorly paid, and many have been reluctant to make a career out of the military.
An adequately paid professional force would presumably overcome both problems, but Russian reformers say Mr. Yeltsin needs to do much more than issue politically palatable decrees.
They say the establishment of a volunteer military should be part of a broader effort to restructure the armed forces, reducing them to fewer than one million while substantially increasing the military budget. The budget is now $16 billion, according to specialists on Parliament's budget committee.
 
 
 
Money Woes
 In fact, much of the military grumbling over Mr. Yeltsin's initiative reflects not only unhappiness over the prospect of diminished status for the armed forces, but grave skepticism over whether the Russian Government, which already has trouble paying back wages to its workers, will come up with the necessary funds.
"It is purely a populist decree and nothing will be achieved," Aleksandr I. Lebed, the retired general and presidential candidate, said, reflecting the view of many in the armed forces. "In order to have a professional army, one must have a powerful economy. Our economy is half alive, semi-collapsed and standing on its knees."
Dmitri V. Trenin, a former Army officer and military expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, disagreed. He said that a volunteer force was a goal worth striving for, though he asserted that Mr. Yeltsin's plan to create a professional military by the year 2000 was wildly unrealistic.
"Sure, building an all-volunteer force is a costly proposition," Mr. Trenin said. "But there is no sense in delay. The longer you delay the more difficult it will be at end of day, and the degradation of Soviet military establishment continues at a high rate."
Ultimately, however, the fate of Mr. Yeltsin's plan may turn less on professional disputes over the structure and purpose of the armed forces than on the military's self-image.
Will the Russian military cling to its old traditions or seek a new relationship with the rest of Russian society?
Though many officers resist such a change, Boris Gromov, the general who led Russian forces out of Afghanistan and who has been prominently mentioned as a potential successor to Gen. Pavel Grachev, the unpopular Defense Minister, is four-square behind the move.
The Russian military needs "professionals rather than kids," he declared in a recent television interview.
With a professional military, he added, there would be "less mothers' tears."

Prison: Where the Money Is

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD 

 BODY:
CAN society afford to eliminate crime?
No, on two counts, says Mark A. Cohen, an economics professor at Vanderbilt University's Owen Graduate School of Management. "Society cannot afford a zero crime rate," he said. "We would bankrupt ourselves, and we'd also have a society we wouldn't like." The society created, he said, would resemble the old Soviet Union. 
 Yet Mr. Cohen's own studies, which estimate that crime costs this country roughly $500 billion a year, including costs to victims and the price of running prisons, leave a nagging question in a campaign year when the issue has already been injected into Presidential politics: Ideology aside, what is the most efficient way to reduce crime? Mr. Cohen's calculations have ignited a debate among academic experts, law enforcement officials and politicians.
"Whether his estimate is exactly right or is off by $100 billion doesn't matter because we know the number is so big," said David Rasmussen, a professor of economics at Florida State University who has evaluated crime costs for the Florida Legislature. "The real question is not the exact dollar figure, but how we could use it to run our prison system more effectively or establish more crime prevention programs."
Important results might be gleaned from economic studies of the most effective way to reduce crime, said Jeffrey Roth, a principal research associate at the Urban Institute. "The real question is where will you produce the most crime reduction for a dollar spent," Mr. Roth said. "This is not a liberal versus conservative question. It's a bang for the buck question."
The stakes in this argument are high because a number of states find themselves squeezed between an angry public's demand for getting tough on crime and the escalating costs of building more prisons. This year, for the first time, California is spending more for building and operating prisons than for its vaunted public colleges and universities. Prisons are the fastest growing item in almost all state budgets.
But is $500 billion a realistic figure? Some criminologists not only criticize such estimates as excessive but say economists like Mr. Cohen use arbitrary and inconsistent calculations. Mr. Cohen's recent report, prepared for the Justice Department, included intangible factors like pain and suffering and reduced quality of life, which he based on jury awards; he calculated that the annual total came to $450 billion.
Another $40 to $50 billion came from the costs of running state and Federal prisons and local jails, bringing the total close to $500 billion. This figure excludes the losses in poor, high-crime neighborhoods from depressed property values, disinvestment and shuttered businesses.
 
 
 
Cost Analysis
 Franklin Zimring, director of the Earl Warren Legal Institute at the University of California at Berkeley, who calls the $500 billion estimate a "phony number" and "junk science," is worried that by fixing the cost of crime so high, the building of prisons look like a cheap and therefore more politically palatable answer to crime.
Most earlier studies of this issue have merely attempted to look at whether prisons pay for themselves. John J. DiIulio Jr., a professor of politics and public affairs at Princeton University, has concluded that prison does pay after surveys of inmates in New Jersey and Wisconsin state prisons. Mr. DiIulio found that inmates there had committed 12 or more crimes in the year before their incarceration, excluding drug offenses. Given the cost of $25,000 to keep a prisoner behind bars for a year, he said that for every dollar spent to keep a prisoner locked up, "society saves at least $2.80 in the social costs of crimes averted."
The conventional wisdom these days is to keep criminals in prison longer. Mr. Cohen, who has studied the cost benefits of prison terms, said that while a longer sentence would be economically efficient in reducing rape, assault and automobile theft, it would not be in diminishing burglary and larceny. The cost of added time for these two crimes, he said, would be greater to society than the price of the crimes committed.
A forthcoming study by Peter Greenwood of the Rand Corporation attempts to measure the relative cost efficiency of prevention versus prison. An examination of four prevention programs in different states, including Head Start, a parent training program, a program to keep high-risk juveniles in high school and an experimental program with 12- and 13-year-old delinquents, found that these programs "would be twice or three times as cost effective as just putting people in prison," he said.
In a study soon to be published, Mr. Cohen estimates that preventing a high-risk youth, so called because he comes from a troubled family and a bad neighborhood, from becoming a career criminal would save society $1.5 million to $2 million.
Mr. Greenwood and Mr. Cohen acknowledge that prevention is a long-term policy, and that the public and politicians want immediate benefits. Another difficulty is that Americans appear to be willing to tolerate government if it means more prisons but not new social programs.
Mr. Greenwood, however, believes: "If we can afford to build prisons, we can afford prevention. It would save prison cells later."

HEADLINE: In the Tradition of Bigfoot and Elvis, the Goatsucker

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY

 BODY:
THE goatsucker is rampaging across Mexico, leaving dread and panic as it goes. Dozens of attacks have been reported: farmyard goats, sheep and turkeys have turned up dead and drained of blood, their flesh punctured by strange tooth marks. Lately the flying fiend has begun to assault humans as well.
Or so go the reports, which are being lapped up here the way North Americans sometimes seize on tales of kidnappers descending in U.F.O.'s. 
 "It was an animal that was hitting me in the head with something like wings," recounted Benjamin Zamarripa, a farmer from the arid wilds of northern Mexico, explaining the gouges on his cheek. "Then I felt talons ripping open my face. I felt the blood on my face."
 
 
 
Puerto Rican Origins
 The goatsucker (or chupacabras, in Spanish) first appeared late last year in Puerto Rico, where it was said to have laid waste to the livestock of dozens of farmers. It made a pass through south Florida, preying mainly on chickens and ducks and causing hysteria in Hispanic communities.
But in Mexico the vampire has taken on a new and more hideous form, and the way it is being depicted may say a lot more about Mexico than about the likelihood that the land is being ravaged by something supernatural. The Puerto Rican goatsucker was a bristly, bulge-eyed rat with the hind legs of a kangaroo, capable of escaping after its crimes in high-speed sprints. In Mexico the creature sprouted claws and black membranous wings. It descends at night, from the sky.
Mexico has many claims to modernity. It has cellular communications, streetside cash machines that work most of the time, free trade with the United States. But, as the goatsucker would indicate, in some ways part of Mexico is a folk society in a business suit.
Level-headed Mexican authorities have pooh-poohed the threat and offered scientific explanations. The Ministry of Agriculture summoned a news conference to propagate the results of autopsies on a turkey, a duck and a chicken believed by their terrified owners to be goatsucker victims. The forensic examination showed that in each case the killer was a "carnivore, probably a coyote or dog, not a bloodsucker."
Wild dogs have probably been driven to raid farm corrals because a severe drought in northern Mexico has killed off the rabbits and rodents they normally eat, the officials said. Human victims like Mr. Zamarripa probably got in the way of a flock of bats. The Environment Secretary, Julia Carabias, pleaded with people to stop lighting fires in caves to smoke out the goatsucker, because they were hurting rare panthers instead.
Though the goatsucker's depredations began in Mexico's rural north, the loathing spread in no time to the cities. It took off after Televisa, Mexico's giant national television network, carried a report recounting several apparent attacks and leaving ominously open the question about what the assailant could be.
After that, civil defense forces were called repeatedly to homes in Mexico City where the creature was said to have touched down. (In one episode, where the deceased was a dove, a neighbor came forward to confess that his cat had telltale feathers in its whiskers.)
Educated Mexicans have delighted in flirting with goatsucker fears. They eagerly read and chat about the latest sighting on the chupacabras home page on the Internet (http://www.princeton.edu/accion/chupa .html), managed by a Princeton University student. Scholars at a leading Mexico City university organized a goatsucker symposium. The columnist Guadalupe Loaeza said she got the willies after a long debate about the goatsucker over a dinner with intellectual friends. She raced home in her car, reciting a rosary the whole way, and before turning in peeked under her bed to make sure there was no little black thing lurking there.
If Mexico has embraced the goatsucker as its own analog to the U.F.O., it is a distinctly low-tech model: there is no titillating mystery or promise of unexplored horizons associated with this unidentified flier. Instead, hard economic times seem to have only increased Mexicans' longstanding sense -- dating as far back as the defeat of the Aztecs by Hernan Cortes -- that they are being stalked by some rapacious, unseen predator.
 
 
 
Co-Opted Already
 Finally, however, Mexicans are bringing the menace down to earth. There are two popular goatsucker radio tunes, a rap song and a merengue, a dance from the tropics. A television wrestler took the goatsucker name.
The emerging consensus is that the real goatsucker is former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who is blamed by most Mexicans for draining the economy of its lifeblood. Led by a vanguard of cartoonists, who have portrayed Mr. Salinas with his unmistakable bald head and a fresh set of bat wings, Mexicans have raised a shield of irony, which has often been their best defense against outbreaks of national paranoia.

. . . And One Man Voted Twice

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
In the coming weeks you will read many analyses of the Israeli election, but for my money you can reduce the outcome to four words: The bad guys won. No, I'm not talking about those Israelis who voted for Bibi Netanyahu. They are entitled to their choice. I'm talking about the Jewish and Muslim extremists, whose actions during the last nine months transformed Israeli politics and made Mr. Netanyahu's victory possible.
I'm talking first and foremost about the one Israeli who got to vote twice. His name is Yigal Amir and he is the religious extremist who assassinated Yitzhak Rabin. Under Israeli law, even an assassin gets to vote. So last Wednesday, at the Ohalei Kedar Prison, Mr. Amir trudged out of his cell in shackles and cast his vote -- no doubt for Mr. Netanyahu. What poetic injustice. First Mr. Amir voted with a bullet and then he voted with a ballot. Having murdered the one Labor Party leader who would have certainly beaten Mr. Netanyahu, Mr. Amir finished his work with an absurd legal flourish, sealing his ballot under the watchful eye of prison guards. 
 In killing Mr. Rabin, Mr. Amir deprived the Labor Party of its only leader who embodied both a vision of reconciliation with the Palestinians and the hard-headed toughness to persuade a majority of Israelis to follow him. Try as he might, Shimon Peres just couldn't bring together those two attributes. But Mr. Amir did something else -- something more subtle and paralyzing. By pumping two bullets into Mr. Rabin's back, he raised the terrifying specter of civil war in Israel, if the peace process went any further. In the wake of the assassination, many Israelis, subconsciously, wanted to remove the divisive peace process from the public agenda, and that too worked against Mr. Peres. Said an Israeli political theorist, Yaron Ezrahi: "I was in a cab after the election and my driver was so happy that Likud won. I said, 'Why?' He said: 'Because peace divides us. I'm not afraid to quarrel with the Arabs. But I am afraid to quarrel with my son.' "
What Yigal Amir began from the Jewish fringe, the Palestinian suicide bombers finished off from the Muslim fringe. The suicide bombers wiped out Mr. Peres's 16-point lead in the polls, by creating a sense among Israelis that the peace process equaled insecurity. Logically, many Israelis understood that the extremists were acting in order to stop the peace process -- precisely because it was working and rendering their extremist visions obsolete. But fear always trumps logic.
I know. I was just in Israel. Instead of staying as usual at the King David Hotel in Jerusalem, I stayed at a more low-profile, out-of-the-way place, which I thought would never be a target. Instead of walking to my appointments, I avoided the center city, for fear of being on Jaffa Road when the next suicide bomb might go off. Instead of waiting calmly at traffic lights, I got nervous until the light changed and my taxi moved away from any potential bus bombs. If I, as a visitor, felt that sort of anxiety, what about Israelis? Who can blame so many of them for reaching out to the tempting, but illusory, appeal of Mr. Netanyahu -- that he will bring "peace with security," and without any further concessions to the Arabs.
But the forces that made Mr. Netanyahu a winning candidate will make him a disastrous Prime Minister, unless he can break free of them. No Likud leader has ever inherited what Mr. Netanyahu is inheriting: two implemented peace accords with the Palestinians and a pathway to a final settlement, a full peace with Jordan and Egypt, low-level negotiations with Syria, diplomatic relations with Morocco, Qatar, Oman and Tunisia, unprecedented support from the U.S., plus a booming Israeli economy, thanks partly to the benefits of peace. Mr. Netanyahu has promised that, in his own way, he will preserve and nurture this inheritance, while also bringing more security. That is what he will be judged on.
Both Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres are casualties of their historic decisions in 1993 that produced this inheritance. These two old war horses came together at the end of their long political careers to form one of the most unique and creative leadership teams in Jewish history. Their successes derived from their willingness to face the cruel truth that the long-term security of Israel lies in decisions that will cost some Jewish solidarity. They did not shrink from those decisions. Mr. Rabin paid with his life for his courage. Mr. Peres paid with his career.
Now comes Mr. Netanyahu, riding in on the slogans that Israel can have peace without concessions, security without Palestinian partners and solidarity without costs. Of course, there is no such thing, and soon Mr. Netanyahu will confront that truth. Only then will we know what he is really made of. Only then will we know whether he is capable of making the wrenching decisions vital for Israel's long-term survival. Israel can't afford anything less in its leader.

HEADLINE: Adoption, the Campaign;
Candidates, Yes. But for Parenthood?

BYLINE: By JAN HOFFMAN 

 BODY:
AND now word comes that the First Couple has been thinking for a while about a second child, most likely through adoption. But when Hillary Rodham Clinton shared the news with Time magazine last week, she added an important caveat: the Clintons wouldn't seriously consider adopting until after the November election.
Good answer: Mrs. Clinton shows appropriate sensitivity to needs of adoptee. 
 The First Lady had just cleared a hurdle that a social worker might raise about her suitability to adopt. For if the Clintons are earnest about their family expansionist plans, they, like the parents of the 50,000 children adopted in America each year, will have to submit to a social worker's scrutiny and more on their way through a long obstacle course.
First stop, the home study: every state requires a licensed social worker, who is supposed to represent the best interests of the child, to visit the home. "You can't play head games with these people," cautioned Debra Harder, a spokeswoman for Adoptive Families of America, an adoption information center in Minneapolis. "The social workers are the ones with all the power."
 
 
 
An Odd Couple
 Their application would resemble that of many couples -- older, well-educated, well-to-do, with one biological child from the marriage. But the application might also present a few unique problems. Like: what sort of quality time can you give a young child while you are President of the United States?
If the Clintons think scrutiny by the press or by Kenneth W. Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel, has been excessive, they have yet to be interviewed by an adoption social worker. They might want to consult the kind of list drawn up by Merle Bombardieri, an infertility counselor in Lexington, Mass., consisting of questions that prospective parents are likely to be asked in a home study.
The dwelling itself would be examined, noted Ms. Bombardieri (social workers have been known to whip out tape measures to measure rooms). If Mr. Clinton prevails in November, certainly the child would have his or her own bedroom in a really, really big house for the next four years. But what if Mr. Clinton is suddenly unemployed? The Clintons do not have another home.
Social worker consults checklist, shakes head. Frowns.
In that event, the follow-up questions would undoubtedly be: What would be Mr. Clinton's source of income? Would Mrs. Clinton resume her career as a lawyer? Couple nods eagerly.
Ominous silence. Then: Does that mean Mrs. Clinton would not stay home with the child for at least six months?
Are any legal actions pending against either of them? A Ms. Jones?
A social worker would probably interview the Clintons several times, together and separately, about what they admire about each other and what they would change about each other they could, about their criticisms of how they were raised, their domestic habits (who does the dishes?), their use of contraceptives (why not? you're not secretly hoping to have a baby the other way, are you? do you consider adoption second-best?), work hours, religious commitment, opinions on spanking.
And whose idea is it to adopt? Is this a mutual decision, or is one spouse just going along because the other is adamant?
Ms. Bombardieri said the Clintons would also be asked: why now? "What has changed about your life?" Ms. Bombardieri continued, hypothetically. "You have a 16-year-old daughter. Are you adopting as a way of running away from empty-nest syndrome? Are you denying your own aging? Do you feel that by holding a 4-month-old on your shoulder, you'll look and feel younger and more vibrant?"
Chelsea Clinton would also be interviewed, said Kathie Stocker, an adoption social worker with Holt International Children's Services, based in Eugene, Ore.: "I would ask Chelsea what kind of rules there are in her family, what happens when she doesn't follow them, and what she likes and doesn't like about living under such a tremendous amount of public scrutiny."
 
 
 
Be Flexible
 The Clintons would be asked about backgrounds of children who might be placed with them. The likelihood is slim that an agency would place a healthy white infant with the Clintons: their ages (she is 48, he 49) are a barrier. There are so many thousands of couples who want to adopt from the scarce pool of white infants, said Ms. Harder, "that agencies use age as a subtle case-management technique." Most agencies require that adoptive parents be 40 or under.
Unless, of course, the Clintons would be willing, in the delicate euphemism used by social workers, to be "flexible." Translation: willing to take a mixed-race baby, an older child who has languished in foster care, or one with disabilities.
"The policy makes absolutely no sense," said Ms. Stocker. "That means that people who are older or who are single have to take kids that might be harder to care for."
Their age also bars them from adopting a child from many foreign countries. They meet the limit for a baby girl from China -- their combined ages are less than 100 -- but because they already have a child, they might be offered a daughter with a medical problem like rickets or crossed eyes.
Thousands of Americans over 40 do adopt healthy white infants every year through private channels, said Ms. Stocker, by hiring a lawyer to do the search or placing their own classified ads in small-town newspapers. ("Loving Christian couple wants to make a home for your special baby: large white house, cat, big sister. Call 1-800 . . . .") Under such circumstances, the birth mother would decide whether to place her baby with the Clintons or another couple.
Jean Grumet, a New York-area lawyer who with her husband, after years of tribulations, adopted when she was in her 40's, is rooting for the Clintons. "I'd say follow your heart and go for it," she said. "It's worth all the aggravation. And there is aggravation."
 
 
 
Time Out
 Although most of the questions that would face the Clintons as adoptive parents are of a profoundly private nature, one lingers that is in the national interest. Soon after taking office in 1993, Mr. Clinton signed the Family and Medical Leave Act, guaranteeing workers 12 weeks of unpaid leave for personal matters, including adoption.
Inquiring Americans want to know: how much time off would the First Father take?

Chart: "What We're Really Looking for..."
Common mistakes made by prospective adoptive parents in home interviews.
 
To admit that you are still trying for a pregnancy.
 
To admit that one of you was dragged in by the other and has no interest in adoption.
 
To use the home study as a forum for your doubts and fears about adoptive parenting.
 
For husband and wife to say conflicting things in their individual sessions or for your answers in your applications not to match your face-to-face answers.
 
To talk too much, thereby revealing informatin you wish you hadn't.
 
To be angry rather than confident, persuasive, assertive. Few people get through a home study without getting furious at somebody or something.
 
To be apologetic, defensive, rather than confident, persuasive, assertive.
 
To mention problems that your worker never asked about.
 
To pretend that infertility didn't hurt. It was no big deal, there was nothing to grieve over.
 
To assume that honesty is the the best policy.

HEADLINE: Think About the Port of Brooklyn

 BODY:
New York's harbor, favored by nature and location, has long been a key to the prosperity of the city and region. Through economic ups and downs the Port of New York and New Jersey has managed to grow in trade and traffic but has been losing its once-predominant share of Eastern seaboard commerce, raising concerns, even alarm, over its ability to compete in new shipping environments.
Ever-larger container ships haunt the future. Already they challenge existing facilities on the New Jersey side of the harbor, where the Port Authority invested heavily three decades ago. Unless the harbor gets deeper channels, the ships will choose Baltimore, Norfolk, Va., and Halifax, Nova Scotia. Losing out to those cities could threaten New York's status as a shipping power in the 21st century. 
 Representative Jerrold Nadler, whose district includes parts of Brooklyn and Manhattan, proposes a revitalized Port of Brooklyn. He calls for exploiting its deeper waters, building and improving rail links to the west and New England, and letting the Jersey piers continue to handle standard-size vessels.
The idea is attractive and merits the study the city's Economic Development Corporation has authorized. Indeed, it was alluring before worries about competitiveness and deep-draft requirements began to mount, but political leaders have failed to give the idea its deserved attention. Mr. Nadler's scheme would please his Brooklyn constituents, but he started pushing it years ago when he was a West Side Assemblyman. To be sure, it has the potential for inciting local rivalries for Port Authority attention and resources, but the concept need not die from jealousy or stalemate. Depending on what the studies show, it could be part of a comprehensive plan to put the bustle back in a once-great port.
The Nadler plan is indeed grand. It entails extensive dredging, state-of-the-art storage for the mud and landfills at the Brooklyn shore, to say nothing of new warehouses and transportation connections. The most impressive and daunting of these would be a rail tunnel across the harbor to connect with New Jersey's gateways to the west and south.
Moving mud and rock are the plan's big tasks. The Jersey waterways must be dredged for mud, and they must be drilled for rock at great expense, since the Newark Bay and the channels of Kill van Kull and Arthur Kill hit solid rock at 35 to 40 feet. Brooklyn's waterways, 60 to 65 feet deep before hitting rock, need only be dredged for mud to accommodate deep-draft ships.
The Port Authority leans against this plan, admitting that the Jersey rock-drilling is costly but warning that Brooklyn's development is replete with questions over public and private investment and the environment. All of these issues need expeditious study and the vision of industry and officials on both sides of the harbor. Meanwhile, credit Mr. Nadler for some intriguing ideas.

HEADLINE: A.F.L.-C.I.O. Tries to Reach All Workers in Town Meetings

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
For more than a month, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. has been putting on a road show -- town meetings from coast to coast at which workers tell of meager wages, long hours and oppressive bosses.
The A.F.L.-C.I.O. brought the show, its first such gathering in years, to New York last week in an attempt to spread its message that workers are getting a raw deal. 
 Workers from half a dozen fields told wrenching tales of being paid $3 an hour and working 70-hour weeks.
But the labor federation was not able to fill the house on opening night, and the event failed in another important way: no television stations broadcast the message.
For the A.F.L.-C.I.O., which all but ignored public relations and contacts with grass-roots organizations for more than a decade, the town meetings it is organizing in 28 cities are a form of experimental theater in which the rejuvenated movement is struggling to get its message across.
To labor leaders, these town meetings, with the theme "America Needs a Raise," are a way for rank-and-file workers to tell their tales not only to labor leaders but also to business and political leaders.
The meetings, union officials say, have another aim: to show the nation that the long-dormant A.F.L.-C.I.O. is alive again and heeding the concerns of all workers, not just union members.
At a meeting last Thursday night at the Community Church on East 35th Street -- the first of five such meetings, one in each borough -- sweatshop workers, waiters, grocery clerks and other workers from Manhattan told their stories of exploitation.
Domingo Ayala, a Dominican immigrant, told of earning $200 for working a 72-hour week as a security guard at a Washington Heights supermarket. Sheng-gang Deng said that he was paid 70 cents an hour at a Chinatown restaurant and that his boss illegally kept 30 percent of his tips. Jimmy Owens, a trumpeter, described how jazz musicians often retire penniless and pensionless.
Sounding a theme heard throughout the meeting, Brian McLaughlin, president of the New York Central Labor Council, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s arm in New York, said, "While corporate America is experiencing the highest salaries and compensation packages in the history of America, working families are losing ground every day."
Kenneth McNutt, a laid-off construction industry executive, reached across class lines and roused the audience by saying that something is awry with the economy when high-salary managers like him are tossed out of jobs while chief executives who order downsizing receive multimillion-dollar bonuses.
"There's something in the middle here that's not working anymore," Mr. McNutt said. "There is a huge body of people that's afraid about what's happening with downsizing and the rest of the economy.
"We can't deny any longer that there is a huge change in the market economy and how it drives us. We have to discuss what are we going to do. And what are our children going to do who are in their 20's and 30's? They can't all be Wall Street brokers."
The stories seemed to underscore that even after decades of union struggle, many New York workers are hardly better off than those of a century ago.
One thing that was clear about the meeting was that the A.F.L.-C.I.O. could use help from a shrewd promoter and producer like David Merrick. In a city renowned as a bastion of labor, with more than one million union members, the meeting attracted barely 400 people.
"These meetings are a good idea because anything labor unions can do to make themselves more visible is terrific," said Daniel Walkowitz, a labor historian at New York University. "But they have a publicity job to do. I follow these things, and I hadn't even heard about these town meetings."
Denise Mitchell, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s chief spokeswoman, said that the meetings in Chicago, Nashville and Columbus attracted crowds as well as television coverage and brought to the public's attention how hard it is for many workers to get by.
She said the New York meetings would culminate with a labor rally on Thursday on Wall Street at which John J. Sweeney, the federation's president, would speak.
Mr. McLaughlin said holding town meetings in each borough would generate more interest than one big citywide meeting. Such meetings, he said, strengthen labor's ties with community groups and the clergy and generate more enthusiasm from union and nonunion workers.
"We're not saying only unionized workers need a raise," said Nicholas Unger, an official with the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees who helped organize the Manhattan meeting. "We're saying all American working people need a raise, and unions will be in the middle of making that happen."

HEADLINE: A Capital Rally Attracts Groups From Across the Nation to Focus on Children's Needs

BYLINE: By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 1

 BODY:
An army of children, parents, teachers and religious leaders converged on the nation's capital today for a rally intended to focus public attention and political power on the economic and social needs of young Americans.
Under a hot blue sky, a crowd estimated by the United States Park Police at 200,000 gathered for the Stand for Children rally, principally organized by Marian Wright Edelman, president of the Children's Defense Fund, which lobbies for Federal assistance for children. 
 "Each of us can do more and better to protect and improve the quality of life for our children," Ms. Edelman said from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. "We can be a better America."
The rally combined elements of a Baptist revival, a grade-school field trip, pledge week on public television and a political demonstration from the 1960's. Choirs sang, preachers preached, children recited speeches. Thousands of teachers and their students came, as did organizations ranging from the Gray Panthers and the Hollywood Women's Political Committee to the Young Men's Christian Association and the Girl Scouts of the U.S.A. Unions, including those representing teachers and health and hospital workers, were heavily represented.
"This right here is e pluribus unum for everybody to see," said Michael B. Curry, a priest at St. James Episcopal Church in Baltimore, referring to the patriotic motto, "Out of many, one."
The first groups to arrive walked sleepy-eyed this morning past homeless vagrants across the street from the White House, down onto the cool green grass by the Washington Monument. Thousands marched over the Memorial Bridge from Virginia to join them at midday. Their ranks reached for a half-mile east of the Lincoln Memorial, flanking the reflecting pool beneath it.
Some carried signs of protest -- "Build Schools, Not Prisons," one sign said in a poster-paint scrawl. Others picnicked beneath the shade trees beside the pool, pushed baby carriages built for four, and sported T-shirts denoting their religious denominations, political affiliations and personal beliefs.
"We're excited to come down here and have the opportunity to scream a little," said Kathy Simons, 42, of Salem, Mass., who works at the Parents' Resource Center at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, providing child care for faculty, students and employees. "There is such an overwhelming frustration in the compromises you have to make every day in quality and availability" of child care, she said.
Destiny Taliaferro, 15, who rode in on an chartered bus from her home in Cleveland, Ohio, said "the march is a starting step to where children will get the rights they deserve," which include "getting the services that everyone should have -- like vaccinations, medical attention, even clothes and food and shelter and housing for some."
No politicians were invited, as the organizers sought to strike a non-partisan tone. "This is a nonpolitical day," said Cristi Carambula, 43, who drove all night from Kalamazoo, Mich., where she directs Childcare Resources, a nonprofit agency. "We as a country are making short-term decisions that will hurt our children in the long term. Reverence for our children has died. That part of our culture is gone."
But nothing is apolitical here in Washington, and the implicit message of the march was that an increasingly conservative Federal Government has slighted children. Not all the marchers shared that precise perspective. Peggy Beavin, a pediatric nurse from Dayton, Ohio, whose daughter, Elizabeth, works on health-care issues for Rep. J. Dennis Hastert, an Illinois Republican, said she hoped the march would "change the way people think," not necessarily the way politicians vote.
Conservatives, seeing a thinly disguised liberal agenda in the march and well aware that Hillary Rodham Clinton was chairwoman of the Children's Defense Fund from 1986 to 1992, blitzed reporters with faxes arguing that the rally was nothing more than an upraised begging bowl from liberal welfare lobbyists and poverty bureaucrats.
"I really think that this march should actually be called 'the march of the social service administrators,' " said Kenneth Weinstein, director of the Government Reform Project for the Heritage Foundation, a conservative Washington research organization.
The organizers and the participants either ignored the criticism, wondered aloud what kind of person could question children's needs, or marshaled statistics showing that the rate of poverty and infant mortality among children in the United States is one of the highest in the developed world. A smaller proportion of poor families with children receive Government aid, and the assistance provided is generally less than in many developed countries, the Census Bureau says.
The march is "about all of America living up to its creed, that all children are created equal," Ms. Edelman said before the rally. Ten million children lack decent health care, she asserted, and Congress is debating Medicaid and welfare proposals that she said would adversely affect millions more.
"We can balance this budget at the same time that we can take care of our children," she said, "but it requires different values and different priorities, and that's what we seek."
In his weekly radio address, President Clinton said today that thousands of children could lose some of their health-care coverage under Republicans' Medicaid proposals. "This could amount to child neglect for a whole generation," he said. Representative Jim Leach of Iowa, in his radio response for the Republicans, did not address the issue.
The rally's leaders want gun-control laws, school vouchers, a $500-per-child tax credit and an adoption tax credit, and oppose cuts in Government benefits for children that have been passed or proposed by Congress. They contend that government -- or the lack of it -- has contributed to the misery of needy children. Twenty-one states across the country are operating their child welfare systems under court mandates, ordering a minimum level of services.
"We've got to focus attention on the needs of children and on child welfare assistance across the country, because we've neglected them for too long" said Nicholas Scoppetta, Commissioner of the Administration of Children's Services of New York City, who was in Washington for the rally.
Mr. Scoppetta's agency, established in February, has a $1.38 billion annual budget and is responsible for 43,000 children in foster care, as well as adoption services, child protection services, child-support enforcement, preventive services to keep children out of foster care, Head Start and, starting in September, day care programs.
"There are certain responsibilities that are the responsibilities of government, and protecting children is one of them," said Mr. Scoppetta, who grew up in a children's institution and has long experience in criminal-justice issues. "The City of New York handled 47,000 child-neglect and child-abuse complaints last year. I don't think that anyone but government can take on that responsibility."

HEADLINE: 2d Suspect Surrenders as New Account of L.I. Attack Is Given

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN 

 BODY:
A second suspect in the nearly fatal beating of a black man outside a Long Island nightclub over the Memorial Day weekend surrendered to authorities in Suffolk County yesterday, and his lawyer gave a new, sharply different version of what has been portrayed as an unprovoked and racially motivated attack.
While officials had characterized the incident as a brutal attack by a white New York police detective who shouted racial slurs as his companions held the victim's friends at bay with a gun, the lawyer said yesterday that several white men had been acting in self-defense against a larger group of menacing blacks in the confrontation at Westhampton Beach, L.I., last Sunday. 
 The developments added a new layer of complexity to a case that has outraged many blacks, left the victim's family in anguish, raised questions about police officers and alcohol, prompted statements by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and some members of the New York's City Council and generated a Federal investigation of possible civil rights violations as well as an intense criminal inquiry.
The man, Austin Offen, 25, of Floral Park, L.I., described by the police as an unemployed construction worker and a student at Nassau Community College, arrived with his lawyer at the Riverhead, L.I., offices of District Attorney James M. Catterson Jr. shortly after 9 A.M. and entered without comment.
"Not one word," Mr. Offen's lawyer, Dominic Barbara, said as he escorted his client past a crowd of reporters and television crews. No charges were filed immediately against Mr. Offen, and Mr. Barbara later said that "negotiations" with the prosecutor were under way. Mr. Catterson had no comment.
In the late afternoon, Mr. Offen was taken to the police headquarters in Southampton, L.I., ostensibly to appear in a lineup before witnesses. It was unclear if such a lineup was held, but in the early evening, Mr. Barbara and Mr. Catterson returned to the prosecutor's office in Riverhead.
"We're going to chat some more," Mr. Catterson said.
At the Suffolk County Jail in Riverhead, Constantine Chronis, 34, a New York City police narcotics detective, was being held in a $1 million bond on a charge of assaulting Shane L. Daniels, 21, of Riverhead in a parking lot outside the Club Marakesh in Westhampton Beach, just after 4 A.M. last Sunday.
Mr. Daniels, who suffered severe head injuries, remained in a coma and in stable but critical condition yesterday at University Hospital in Stony Brook, L.I. Doctors have said that he may have suffered permanent damage to his eyesight.
Since the detective's arrest on Wednesday, police officials, quoting black eyewitnesses, have called the case an apparently unprovoked and brutal attack by the white off-duty detective, a 10-year police veteran who is attached to the Manhattan North narcotics squad and lives in Hicksville, L.I. He has been suspended without pay.
These accounts said the detective, after a night of heavy drinking with white companions, confronted the victim in a parking lot, shouted racial slurs at him and his friends and clubbed him repeatedly with a car's steering wheel lock while another white man held the victim's friends at bay with a gun.
A man who declined to give his name but said he was a friend of Mr. Daniels and had seen the beating confirmed much of the police account in an interview on Friday, but said that he and other blacks had thrown punches in self-defense when attacked by whites. He said he and his friends backed off when one of the white men drew a gun, and that Mr. Daniels was then struck down and savagely beaten as he lay unresisting on the ground.
But Mr. Barbara, in a series of interviews Friday night and early yesterday, portrayed the events outside the nightclub last Sunday in a sharply different light. He said there was a clash between four white men and 15 others, most of them black, and suggested that the white men had been acting in self-defense.
Mr. Barbara acknowledged that his client had been with Detective Chronis at the time of the confrontation and that they left the scene together in Mr. Chronis's car, but he said Mr. Offen had never met the detective until Sunday, when they went out drinking with a mutual friend.
The lawyer also said Mr. Offen had himself been injured in the altercation. "My client has a hole in his head the size of a quarter," said Mr. Barbara, a promient Long Island lawyer whose clients have included Jessica Hahn and Joey Buttafuoco.
Other published reports yesterday quoted Mr. Barbara and Mr. Offen as saying there had been no racial confrontation provoked by whites, and that Detective Chronis, Mr. Offen and two other white men had left the club at 4 A.M., were surrounded by about 15 men, most of them black, and fought in self-defense.
The police said they were searching for well-built white men with short-cropped hair who had been with Detective Chronis on the night of the confrontation.
Mayor Giuliani, who had condemned the beating, pledged a thorough investigation in the case and spoken out strongly about the responsibility of police officers to behave properly, even when off duty, visited the victim's family in Riverhead on Friday.
Last night, more than 200 demonstrators from New York City and Long Island, led by the Rev. Al Sharpton, staged a silent one-mile march through Westhampton to the Club Marakesh to support the victim and his family and to protest what they called the mishandling of the case by the authorities.
"No matter what happened in this club last week, no one deserves to be beaten that way," Mr. Sharpton said at a rally outside the club to a crowd that shouted "Yessir," and "Amen." In calling the rally, he had asked why Detective Chronis had not been charged with attempted murder.
Flanked by three men and a young woman described as eyewitnesses to the beating, Mr. Sharpton said: "It would seem strange to me that law-enforcement people pointed guns at children, ran like fugitives and fled from the scene of a crime, and now they want you people to print that this was a fair fight."

Boldon Wins 100, And Has Big Plans

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN 

DATELINE: EUGENE, Ore., June 1

 BODY:
Ato Boldon of U.C.L.A. was disqualified last year for a false start in the 100 meters. This time, he waited calmly in the blocks at the national collegiate championships, too calmly by his standards. But if his start was tentative today, his finish was not.
He accelerated powerfully, finding some propulsive internal gear, and finished first in a searing 9.92 seconds, the fastest time in the world this year. In winning so formidably, Boldon must now be considered a favorite to win the Olympic gold medal for his native nation of Trinidad and Tobago. 
 Tim Harden, the defending champion from Kentucky, finished a distant second in 10.10 seconds. The only collegiate runner to have posted a faster 100 meters was David Ezinwa, a Nigerian who ran 9.91 while competing for Azusa Pacific in 1992. Before the season is out, Boldon said, he wants to lower Leroy Burrell's world record from 9.85 to something exquisitely uncharted.
"This, too, was an ugly race," Boldon said, referring to the 9.93 seconds he ran last month, the previous fastest mark in the world this year. "Hopefully if I have an ugly race on July 27, I'll have a gold medal."
This is not just wishful thinking. Boldon, a garrulous 22-year-old senior, won a bronze medal at the 1995 world track and field championships in Goteborg, Sweden. He ran 9.92 today with a slight tail wind, hours after the current Olympic champion, Linford Christie of Britain, could muster only 10.04 in Madrid.
Boldon said he considered three 100-meter runners to be the favorites in Atlanta: Donovan Bailey, the 1995 world champion from Canada; Carl Lewis, the two-time Olympic champion, and himself, "the new kid who is not smart enough to be more scared than he is."
"I want to be the future of sprinting," said Boldon, who will also run the 200 meters at the Summer Games. "I don't want Michael Johnson to walk away with his medal. Only a select few can beat Michael. I want to be one of the few."
In the women's 100 meters, D'Andre Hill of Louisiana State defended her title today with a victory in 11.03 seconds, propelling L.S.U. toward its 10th consecutive women's national championship. The men's champion also was familiar: Arkansas won for the fifth time in a row.
The men's 100 lost some of its intrigue Friday night when Obadele Thompson of Texas-El Paso withdrew after straining muscles in his groin and hamstring during semifinal heats of the 100 and 200. On April 13, Thompson ran the fastest 100 meters ever recorded under any conditions -- a wind-aided 9.69 seconds. He, Boldon and Harden figured to provide one of the most tantalizing collegiate 100-meter races in years.
The fact that Thompson hurt himself while attempting to run two races in two hours on Friday renewed questions about whether collegiate athletes leave themselves vulnerable to injury by competing in too many events. Bob Kitchens, the Texas-El Paso coach, said he advised Thompson not to run the 200 after the sprinter strained a groin muscle in the 100 semifinals. Thompson ran anyway, and he pulled up after pulling a hamstring.
"Now you see why I didn't want my guy running both events," said John Smith, Boldon's coach at U.C.L.A.
Last season, Boldon won the collegiate 200, but he decided to skip the half-lap race this year. Today's 200 final was scheduled only 35 minutes after the 100 final, and Boldon did not want to risk pulling a muscle.
Boldon is the latest splash in a wave of sprinters and jumpers from Caribbean and Atlantic island nations that has pounded ashore at American universities. Fourteen of the 15 athletes from island countries who won medals at the 1995 world championships were educated in the United States. The foreign influence is so pervasive that only three American-born men won running events at these collegiate championships.
"Caribbean people are not so much lacking, but when you come here and so much is offered, you want to reach out and grab it," said Debbie Ferguson, a Bahamian-born sprinter at the University of Georgia.
This summer marks the 20th anniversary of Trinidad's last victory in the Olympic 100 meters, the 10.06 run by Hasely Crawford at the 1976 Montreal Games.
"Trinidad is suffering economically," Boldon said. "The people need a lift. I've embraced that need as my goal. It's important to have people excited about Trinidad again."

The Lettuce Truce

BYLINE: By CAREY GOLDBERG 

 BODY:
The two men who started the great lettuce war 17 years ago are dead. But last week, their successors signed a contract that ended the bitter chapter of farm labor history the two men wrote.
The fight over a labor contract was begun by Cesar Chavez, the farm labor organizer, and Ted Taylor, whose company, Bruce Church, Inc., grew Red Coach lettuce. Starting in 1979, Mr. Chavez's United Farm Workers of America organized strikes and supermarket boycotts, and Mr. Taylor kept farming and filing law-suits. 
 But last February, both sides decided that enough was enough. Mr. Taylor's son, Steve, and Mr. Chavez's son-in-law, Arturo Rodriguez, signed a five-year contract for more than 400 workers last week at a festive ceremony in Salinas featuring -- naturally -- display boxes of fresh-picked lettuce.

HEADLINE: Whitewater Verdict Didn't Taint the Clintons;
Hot Springs Reborn

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re Maureen Dowd's slicing comments about the Clintons in "Hot Springs Eternal" (column, May 30): 
 In the 1930's and 40's, Hot Springs, Ark., could possibly have been described as a "hangout of gamblers and roues." By 1952, when Bill Clinton arrived there as a small boy, change was already under way, and by the late 1960's the town was shut tight and has been strictly on the up and up ever since.
To any child there, Hot Springs made a lovely little case study of how government can work: an economy can be overhauled, and the law enforced, when the people have a mind to do it. Too bad more of our politicians (and columnists) didn't grow up there.

HEADLINE: I-287: Extend It and They Will Drive on It;
A New 20-Mile Stretch Has Changed Traffic Patterns in Unintended Ways

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: WANAQUE, N.J.

 BODY:
Here in northern Passaic County, development is starting to push at the edges of once-remote forests. Sixty miles to the southwest, a sleepy country highway has become a major truck route. And over in Westchester County, booming traffic has led to plans to widen the east-west interstate.
Each is a chapter of the same story, ripple effects from the opening two and a half years ago of a new, 20-mile stretch of Interstate 287, from Montville, N.J., to Suffern, just across the New York border. The new road has changed traffic patterns across the region. It has openedan environmentally sensitive watershed area to a potential construction boom. And it serves as a primer on the consequences, intended or not, of highway construction. 
 In the 1940's and 1950's, as Robert Moses was building highway after highway through New York City, Long Island and areas upstate, planners learned that it is all but impossible to build one's way out of highway congestion. More roads encourage more driving. They make remote areas accessible, which leads to development, which brings in more drivers. This is now conventional wisdom to many transportation analysts, and they point to Interstate 287 as proof.
"It's as if we hadn't learned anything in the last 50 years," said David Bernstein, a professor of civil engineering at Princeton University who has studied the phenomenon. "The rule is this: If you build it, they will come. It's called induced demand. Every mile of road you build induces people to drive."
To some degree, state highway officials agree. "We're not trying to build out of congestion anymore," said Sharon L. Landers, deputy transportation commissioner. "We don't even have that option anymore. There's no room."
Still, she argued that the final piece of Interstate 287 was needed because it was a missing link in the region's web of highways. The simple fact that the highway is used by more than 50,000 vehicles daily shows, she said, that it is needed.
 
Mission Accomplished
Long-Haul Drivers Can Bypass City
The highway has, in part, done what it was supposed to: enable long-distance motorists, particularly truckers, to swing wide of New York City. Drivers headed from Boston to Baltimore who used to take the Cross-Bronx Expressway, the George Washington Bridge and the New Jersey Turnpike can now take a less-direct but less-congested route, the Cross-Westchester Expressway, Tappan Zee Bridge and Interstate 287, picking up the turnpike south of the worst traffic areas.
The slightly longer trip may actually be faster for truckers and can lower shipping costs. In the two years after the highway opened, truck traffic on the Tappan Zee rose 70 percent.
But there has been no reduction in the traffic on the old route. It is as if legions of cars and trucks just materialized. At the same time, enterprising truckers have found that with the Interstate 287 link, they can avoid the turnpike and its high tolls altogether by taking secondary highways through Mercer and Somerset counties. As a result, truck traffic on those roads has soared.
"None of this comes as any surprise; this is what highways do," said Jeff Zupan, a transportation consultant to the Regional Plan Association, a nonprofit group that advises governments on development.
The new, six-lane stretch of Interstate 287 completed a beltway around the metropolitan region, like half a giant circle with New York City at its center. The last segment, a 20-mile stretch through Morris, Passaic and Bergen counties, was fought by residents, environmental groups and some elected officials for 20 years. But they lost the battle in the 1980's, and the new road opened in November 1993. An interchange in Suffern, linking Interstate 287 to the New York State Thruway, opened the next year.
"It was needed because it makes the movement of goods around the region easier," Mr. Zupan said. "If it's difficult and expensive to move things from one place to another, if every truck headed to New England has to go through the Bronx, then the region is not going to stay competitive."
At the same time, many local officials say that Interstate 287 will spur a population explosion in the region it passes through. To date, however, the boom has been slow to materialize, muted by a sluggish economy and also by the region's hilly topography.
"Highways bring suburban sprawl out here, bring industry out here, and suddenly this area is a job center," said G. Thomas Donch, Mayor of Franklin Lakes. "How do people get here to work? There's no mass transit, so they drive. So more highways, more traffic."
 
Building Welcomed
Montville's Mayor Cites Tax Revenue
Some municipal officials, like Montville Mayor Robert C. Auriemma, welcome the new construction, or ratables, because of the property taxes it brings in. "The highway brought us ratables we really needed," he said. Montville saw $75 million in construction in 1994 and 1995, nearly all of it residential, he said.
New housing and retail and office buildings have already sprouted along Interstate 287, and opponents of development predict that each off ramp will become a "can opener," punching a hole for development and traffic to pour through. In Wanaque, Passaic County is about to build a much wider Route 511 to carry the expected increase in traffic.
It is up to local officials and local zoning laws to determine just how much construction to allow. Those who supported the highway, like Richard A. DuHaime, a Passaic County freeholder, say there is nothing to fear. "Our officials are not going to allow heavy development, and we have very strong environmental laws," said Mr. DuHaime, who is seeking the Republican nomination for United States Senate. The highway was needed, he said, "for people who live here to get around."
Some building and population growth are inevitable, he said. "The bottom line is, the U.S. population keeps growing," he said. "You can't put your head in the sand and pretend it's not happening. You have to keep building."
But Jeff Tittel of Ringwood, a vocal opponent of development in the region, said the highway would almost certainly mean uncontrolled sprawl. Mr. Tittel, who runs a political mailing business, said elected officials and zoning laws could change. "They're going to ruin this place," he said.
Interstate 287 cuts through the Ramapo Mountains less than a mile and a half from the Wanaque Reservoir, part of a crucial watershed area that supplies water for two million people downstream. More than 7,000 acres of privately owned forest around the reservoir, land once so remote that it had little prospect for development, is now within reach of a major highway. Local officials note that much of the land is owned by developers and say that proposals for large-scale development are inevitable over the next few years.
Tim Dillingham, state director of the Sierra Club, said: "The opening of 287 was the single biggest threat to the New Jersey highlands. Watershed land, particularly land around a lake or reservoir, has to be kept undeveloped to protect the water supply."
The Wanaque Reservoir and the mountains around it are part of the same watershed area as Sterling Forest, in neighboring Orange County, N.Y. In fact, much of the forest drains into the reservoir. But while state and Federal officials, including Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey, want the Government to buy Sterling Forest to prevent its development, they have said little about protecting land around the reservoir.
Except in some communities along Route 17, which has seen a sharp decline in truck traffic since Interstate 287 opened, residents of this region seem almost uniformly unhappy with the traffic and noise of the interstate. On its grooved concrete surface, which state officials say is safer than asphalt, tires make a high, whining sound, so the highway is louder than most.
Edith and Anthony DiOrio's home in Franklin Lakes once looked out on a wooded hillside. Now, it is less than 50 feet from the interstate, and the growl and fumes of engines are their constant neighbors. Friends no longer drop by to use their pool and boccie court.
"This is hell," Mrs. DiOrio said. "It's entirely changed our lives. We can't hear ourselves think. I can clean my windows one day and the next day you can't see through them."
Last year, in Suffern, a tanker truck careened off the interchange and leaked propane, forcing the town to shut its water wells.
"We realized how vulnerable we were," Mayor George J. Parness said. "One serious spill, and our water supply could be ruined forever."
What is happening alongside the new stretch of Interstate 287 was widely predicted, but what is going on in Pennington, a small town 60 miles away, was not. Pennington, five miles north of Trenton in Mercer County, straddles Highway 31, a winding, hilly two-lane road flanked by residential drives, small shops, stands of trees and fields.
 
Unintended Change
Once-Pastoral Road Now Truck Route
Interstate 287 transformed this pastoral road into a truck route, and every diner along it has become a de facto truck stop. In 1991, when New Jersey Turnpike tolls were doubled, the trickle of trucks here became a steady stream. The opening of Interstate 287 made it a torrent.
In 1993, 250,000 to 300,000 heavy trucks used Highway 31, according to the State Department of Transportation. Last year, there were about 1.3 million -- equal to the truck traffic on some six-lane highways. According to state officials and the truckers, most of those trucks were on their way to or from Interstate 287.
Truckers heading north or south generally take the New Jersey Turnpike. But with the completion of the Interstate 287 loop, many truckers found they could use Interstate 95 in Pennsylvania, Highway 31, Highway 202 and Interstate 287 instead, while losing little or no time. In the process, an 18-wheeler would avoid the $18.20 toll on the turnpike, and pay $10 to cross the Tappan Zee rather than $20 for the George Washington.
"No way I'd pay those tolls if I could avoid it," Herbert Marsh, an independent trucker hauling tomatoes from North Carolina to Massachusetts, said on a recent day at the tiny Amwell Valley Diner on Highway 31 in Hopewell Township.
John Addalia, owner of Addalia's Country Florist on Highway 31 in Pennington, said many of his customers fear venturing onto the road. "We're in the country here, but lately it feels like I'm in the middle of an eight-lane highway," he said.
Yet despite the huge shift of trucks to Interstate 287 and various secondary highways, there has been no decline in traffic on the traditional route through New Jersey.
The number of trucks crossing the Tappan Zee Bridge leapt to 2.9 million last year from 1.7 million in 1993. In the same period, truck crossings on the much busier George Washington Bridge fell by just 170,000, to 7.1 million.
About 1.3 million trucks a year use the new stretch of Interstate 287, according to a state study. But since it opened, rather than fewer trucks on the turnpike, there have been more -- 16.3 million last year, up from 15.5 million in 1993.
So where are all the trucks on other routes coming from?
"Trucking competes better with freight rail than it did a couple of years ago," said Sam L. Cunninghame, executive director of the New Jersey Motor Truck Association, an association of trucking companies. "With guys bypassing the tolls, it became more economical."
Ms. Landers, of the State Department of Transportation, said that the state was looking for ways to entice truckers back to the turnpike, but that, if traffic there was worse than ever, it was questionable how attractive that would be. She said the authorities could make Routes 31 and 202 less appealing through more aggressive law enforcement.
The state is not considering widening Routes 31 and 202, she said.
To accommodate growing traffic, New Jersey is widening older segments of Interstate 287, south of Route 80, and New York is planning to widen Interstate 287 through Westchester County. Transportation planners say the growth in traffic through Westchester is almost entirely due to completion of the Interstate 287 beltway.
"You could have roads begetting roads, and once you start that way, it never ends," said John Orcutt, executive director of the Tri-State Transportation Campaign, a nonprofit transportation policy group. "If you increase highway capacity, your traffic will increase to fill it."

 CORRECTION:
An article on Sunday about the effects of the opening of a 20-mile stretch of Interstate 287 in New Jersey misstated the given name and title of an official from the Tri-State Transportation Campaign. He is Jonathan Orcutt, not John, and he is the group's associate director, not executive director.

HEADLINE: A Few Bright Spots for Young People Seeking Summer Jobs

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
At 18, Antoine Joyce is a veteran of New York City's summer jobs market. Having been employed for four summers in the Federal Government's largest employment program for teen-agers, he has been cast off this year to fend for himself.
"You just have to go for it," said Mr. Joyce, of Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, who finished his sophomore year at John Jay College for Criminal Justice in May and has landed summer employment as a producer for the All Star Talent Show Network, a not-for-profit Manhattan company that stages talent shows in poor neighborhoods. 
 "I like new experiences, and you can't rely on the government to find them for you," he said.
Such pluck will be required this year of summer job seekers across the New York region, from Hartford to Trenton, where job opportunities for teen-agers have always been scarcer than in most of the country. The summer of 1996 promises to be as tough as ever.
According to business executives, economists and job seekers, the market for summer jobs is at best a mixed bag in which increases in hiring, mainly at suburban malls and in resort areas, are being offset by deep cuts in the Federal Summer Youth Employment Program for youngsters from poor families.
Those cuts promise to take their biggest toll in New York City, where the Federal program has paid the salaries of more than 30,000 young workers during each summer for the last decade, and where financing has been slashed by $10.5 million, to $24.5 million, this year.
At a news conference scheduled for Tuesday, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani is expected to implore upon private companies to not only offer young people summer employment, but also to contribute money to create other summer jobs at city agencies and not-for-profit organizations.
"We are asking the private sector to step up," said Ninfa Segarra, the Deputy Mayor for Education and Human Services and a member of the Commission on Youth Empowerment Services, created by the Mayor in April.
The city's chief inducements are two "challenge grant" programs, to be administered by the commission, in which the city itself has pledged $1 million and United Way of New York City has pledged $400,000.
City officials hope that money will be matched by private donations.
But no one expects corporate support to fully make up for the cutbacks in Federal money, which have been shrinking each year since 1991.
Economists say the result has been a widening disparity between the job opportunities available for young people in the New York City region and elsewhere in the country.
The experts say New York City youngsters are handicapped because jobs in manufacturing and agriculture -- large sources of summer employment elsewhere in the nation -- are in short supply.
Young people in the city face the added problems of intense competition from immigrants for entry-level jobs, and, for many, of living in neighborhoods that are far from the employment centers of Manhattan.
"The region has always lagged," said John Weiting, the New York Regional Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Now, he added, because the regional economy is sluggish, "the gap for young people has gotten wider."
According to Federal data, 75 percent of the people 16 to 24 years old in New York and New Jersey who sought summer jobs last year found them. That compared with an 86 percent success rate the previous summer, Mr. Weiting said.
Still, prospects have brightened for youths in some parts of the region since a surge in tourism and a rise in retail sales has left some employers scrambling for summer help.
"This is a place any kid would want to work, and we still have jobs to fill," said Denise Putlock, director of marketing at Jenkinson's Pavilion, a large seashore resort in Point Pleasant, N.J.
She said that Jenkinson's plans to hire 2,000 youngsters this summer and that it visited nearby colleges last month to recruit workers.
Elsewhere in the region, business people said demand for summer workers has picked up at shopping malls and along suburban main streets.
"You see signs in lots of windows for part-time clerks, for baggers, for the kinds of jobs that youngsters can fill," said Barbara Stracka, manager of marketing for the Workplace Inc., a job placement agency in Bridgeport that works with young job seekers in southwestern Connecticut.
"I'm not sure that there as many jobs as there are kids looking for them, but things look much better than last year," she said.
New York City's largest summer-jobs program that places young people with private companies -- and without government subsidies -- is sponsored by the New York City Partnership, the social service arm of the city's Chamber of Commerce. It said it expected to fill 3,000 jobs at 200 companies, the same as last summer.
The partnership has for years offered some of the best jobs available to young people in the city, since its members do the hiring, and youngsters lucky enough to be selected work in such diverse settings as advertising agencies and banks.
But this year, the partnership must work harder than ever, said Paula Gavin, president of the Y.M.C.A. of Greater New York and managing director of the summer-jobs program.
"Although the economy has turned up a little, companies are being very, very cautious about every expense," Ms. Gavin said, adding that many large Manhattan companies that have been laying off adult workers are now reluctant to hire as many young people as they have in past summers.
"Many of these companies are in a period of transition where they are looking inward," she said, "and the partnership has to be creative if we are going to inspire them to take on young people."
Such complex cross-currents of economic growth and corporate cutbacks, and of reduced government support, have not been lost on young job seekers, many of whom said they have knocked on more doors, sent out more applications and pulled more strings than in previous years.
"There aren't enough places hiring," said Jennifer N. Silveira, 17, of Bridgeport, who will graduate from Notre Dame High School in Fairfield on Saturday, and has yet to line up a summer job. Although she has worked part time at several stores, making no more than $5.25 an hour, Miss Silveira said she is determined to make more money to help pay her bills at Fairfield University, where she will enroll next year.
"This is getting serious," she said, adding that she is pinning her hopes on an application she has submitted for a job in the credit card department of the People's Bank in Bridgeport, paying $9.35 an hour. "My friend works there and she is going to try to get me in," she said.
In New York City, Shantae Ridley, a 17-year-old junior at Manhattan Village Academy, is looking for her first summer job. On the advice of a Y.M.C.A. counselor, she has applied through the partnership program with Audits and Surveys, a Manhattan market research company.
That would be her first choice. But she has also applied to the city or a job through the Federally financed summer jobs program.
"This is hard," she said. "I just hope one of my applications is accepted."

HEADLINE: U.S. Getting Public Housing Closer to the Ground

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR 

DATELINE: NEWARK, June 1

 BODY:
Flexing the toe of her sneaker, Sheila Ingram digs through the patchy baldness of the lawn in Oscar E. Miles Village, a new public town-house project in the heart of Newark. Every few minutes she unearths an inch-long broken glass vial with a tapered blue, red or green plastic screw top and displays it triumphantly.
"This place is a drug haven; they sell just as much here as they did in the towers," she says, scoffing at a neighbor who argues that the low-rise developments have brought nothing but good. 
 "Your son sells drugs," Mrs. Ingram yells.
"My son does not," the woman answers. After another outburst from Mrs. Ingram, she slightly tempers her denial. "He does not sell from my house," she says.
The 150 units in their village represent an emerging face for public housing, around the country and particularly in Newark, where officials hope an ambitious program will not only replace monolithic towers with small, grassy squares and low buildings, but will also foster a sense of community among residents. Rather than feeling isolation and the stigma associated with a high-rise public dwelling, residents may be more inclined to exert control over their surroundings to combat the drug deals and crime that have gripped housing projects for years, housing experts say.
"The history is clear that the high-rises just don't work and we have to replace them," said Henry G. Cisneros, Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. "This has the potential to change American cities because so many are damaged by the out-of-control conditions in public housing."
After 12 years of destroying 22,000 apartments, HUD is in the middle of an eight-year plan to spend more than $2.5 billion to tear down 100,000 apartments in high-rise buildings nationwide. In total, about 10 percent of public housing constructed in the building boom of the 1950's and 60's will be knocked down.
The pace of change has accelerated over the last year because of new Federal legislation pushed by both Democrats and Republicans giving local housing authorities more autonomy and streamlining legal guidelines on how tenants are chosen, managed and evicted.
But advocates for the poor say the Government is putting too much stock in just reducing the scale of its housing, that many problems remain to be tackled. They also regret the mass destruction of the older units, arguing that some roof overhead is better than none at all, given the slow pace at which the units are replaced and the extent of homelessness. Residents like Mrs. Ingram are skeptical that enough is being done to change the mentality of the people transferred into the latest developments.
"Sure it is better living conditions, but if you don't change the environment, do something about the drugs, these places will eventually look like the rest," Mrs. Ingram said.
"They want to sugarcoat it like it is so much better," she said, referring to a nearby upscale town house development. "They want to make out like this is Society Hill. This is no Society Hill. This is still a hellhole."
In Newark, with the dynamiting of the last two of eight towers at Columbus Homes scheduled for Sunday, the city will have brought down 15 of 45 towers slated for demolition. At least eight high-rise buildings are expected to remain. Having already built 700 low-rise units, Newark is ahead of most cities in changing its public housing largely because of a lawsuit by housing advocates in 1987.
But except for New York City, almost every major city in the country -- including Los Angeles, San Francisco, Houston, St. Louis, Kansas City, New Orleans, Atlanta, Boston, Detroit, Denver, San Francisco and Washington -- will be tearing down infamous apartment towers.
 
New York City Bucks a Trend
Baltimore plans to raze about 40 buildings in four public housing projects, becoming the first city to eliminate all its public high-rises. Philadelphia has destroyed eight buildings in its Raymond Rosen houses, and Chicago plans to transform its notorious Cabrini-Green and Henry Horner projects.
"This will change the skyline of many American cities and change the fabric of many cities," Mr. Cisneros said. No towers are coming down in New York, considered a national anomaly in public housing. It has almost 3,000 buildings in five boroughs with about 600,000 residents.
Only 392 of those buildings are three stories or smaller, but housing experts point to several factors that have contributed to less decay in New York's high-rises than in those of other cities. First, the buildings were rarely set apart from the rest of the city. Second, the tenants include a heavy percentage of working families, providing the income mix considered a necessary anchor for sound apartment complexes. Third, the city's tight housing market combined with rent controls meant there was very little turnover in renters.
Newark, on the other hand, left the list of troubled housing agencies only in 1993. Its complexes like Columbus Homes, visible to commuters passing on Route 280, became virtual synonyms for urban cankers.
"When people wrote about Newark or when they talked about Newark, they talked about Columbus Homes, they talked about vacant high-rise units, they talked about the crime that infested these units," said Harold Lucas, the director of Newark's Public Housing Authority. "The bad things in Newark became identified by this image of failed public housing. We believe that Newark's image will certainly be improved, but more than that, the failure of public housing will be corrected."
 
More Greenery, Fewer Fears
Tenants often accuse the housing authorities of deliberately ignoring maintenance problems to force them out of the towers. But despite a certain nostalgia for the apartments where they were reared, most residents who were interviewed said their doorstep view was now more likely to be fresh greenery than a comatose junkie.
"It was just wild, wild, all that shooting and stuff," said Helen Goines, the 55-year-old president of the Tenants Association at Oscar E. Miles Village. "You don't have to worry about stepping over people in the corridors anymore. You don't have to worry about the police running into the building. You can send the children out into the backyard to play. It is comfortable, relaxing. You feel you are responsible."
Unlike the hulking towers ghettoized within dangerous, barren parks, the town houses are built within the normal grid pattern of city streets. The roofs come in varied heights and colors, while steps and balustrades lead to each door. It is sometimes difficult to distinguish between public housing and new private developments, which proponents say might increase the number of local shops and other investments.
"Critics think of Newark as this horrible, dysfunctional place," said Joel Freiser, the deputy executive director of the Newark Economic Development Corporation. "But the sheer size of the demolitions and the investment is creating new neighborhoods."
In Newark, the Federal Goverment plans to spend $300 million to convert 3,500 units in five complexes to rubble and to replace them with 2,400 apartments scattered over 50 to 60 sites. The Newark Coalition for Low Income Housing sued in 1987 to try to force Newark to obey one-for-one replacement laws, but an agreement brokered by Judge Dickinson R. Debevoise of Federal District Court here set the number of apartments to be built at 1,777 or more.
It was one of the first such lawsuits, and once Newark residents saw the suburban-like town houses going up, they were more willing to give up high-rises. (Public confidence did suffer a setback after the frames for the first development blew down in a windstorm, forcing the resignation of a previous director for incompetence.)
But Mr. Lucas said occupied units would actually increase to 10,000 from 7,000, because so many high-rise apartments were deemed uninhabitable. HUD officials say that they expect a similar shift nationwide and that any decrease in the number of apartments will be offset by subsidized rent vouchers.
The Federal one-for-one replacement law has been suspended for two years and is likely to be rescinded. In another change accelerating the destruction of the towers, HUD no longer subsidizes the nation's 3,400 autonomous housing agencies for empty apartments. And Republicans and Democrats ceased wrangling three months ago over paying for the current demolitions.
In June, the House and Senate are expected to work out their differences over bills intended to change housing laws enacted 60 years ago. The new law would leave up to local agencies the decisions on rents and who is eligible for housing. The laws would also push privatization in construction and management as well as finding alternative housing through subsidized vouchers.
HUD officials say the House bill, written mostly by Representative Rick A. Lazio, a Republican of Long Island, goes too far in loosening rent restrictions, although both sides want to change rules that automatically set rent at 30 percent of income. The current law is seen as discouraging employment because a higher income means paying a higher rent.
HUD officials say further changes are planned. Aside from the destruction and construction phase, the department is taking over the worst-run agencies, expects to open more housing to working families and is to enforce tougher rules so drug dealers, gang members and other criminals can be evicted quickly.
Critics fear the changes, especially those allowing locally set rent increases, could increase homelessness. They say that low-rise developments will not automatically solve management lapses or housing shortages. There are two million people on waiting lists nationwide.
"Even with low-rise there are complaints about the construction and crime," said Richard Cammarieri, a board member of the Newark Coalition for Low Income Housing. "It is management, and not the style of the housing, that ultimately determines the quality of the housing."

HEADLINE: Hope, and Pragmatism, for U.N. Cities Conference

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

 BODY:
Twenty years ago the United Nations held a conference in Vancouver to talk about a worrying world trend toward urbanization, especially the uncontrolled growth of cities in some of the poorest countries.
That conference, held during the height of the cold war, swiftly descended into ideological bickering between industrialized nations and the third world, backed by the Soviet bloc. It ended with a statement of grandiose demands, almost none of which were fulfilled. 
 Today, the second United Nations Conference on Human Settlements opens in Istanbul. In the 20 years since the first conference, the problems -- and size -- of cities have grown enormously. But the atmosphere surrounding this meeting is markedly different, and delegates sound more pragmatic, businesslike and sober in their hopes of what can be achieved.
For the first time, experienced city mayors may play a more prominent role in discussions than national government officials. Business leaders, scientists and hundreds of private organizations will be represented on national delegations or will hold their own meetings in the shadow of the conference, which runs to June 14. There will be a World Business Forum, a World Cities Assembly for mayors and a symposium of scientists from 72 national academies to discuss ways to use advanced technologies to make cities more livable and efficient.
The central message of the conference may turn out to be that governments alone can no longer cope with urbanization -- and should not try.
Many cities, and not just in poor countries, cannot supply basic public services. That has prompted the World Bank to advise city administrations to turn more of the job of security, sanitation, water and transportation to neighborhood groups or private enterprise.
By 2010, the World Bank says, 1.4 billion people will live without safe water and sanitation, and in countries including Indonesia, Ghana and Guatemala it has begun programs to support community involvement in developing basic services.
Federal governments are also being told to stand aside and reduce subsidies to cities, which often only further impoverish rural areas, sending more people to cities in search of livelihoods.
"Our own struggle with centralized intervention in cities has been a history of profound failures," said Melinda L. Kimble, a Deputy Assistant Secretary of State and a member of the United States delegation, led by Henry G. Cisneros, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. "We are increasingly learning that people, not governments, solve problems."
In the next century, there will be many urban areas without any services to turn over to private management, Ms. Kimble said. She pointed to the "revolutionary" growth in Africa and elsewhere of urban conglomerations that are in effect "villages of 200,000 to 300,000 people."
Mayor Gregory S. Lashutka of Columbus, Ohio, a member of the United States delegation, said cities in the United States were learning that they too have to look for new ways to help themselves.
Speaking from Israel, where he was leading a business delegation before going to Istanbul, Mr. Lashutka, a Republican, said, "The reality is we're going to have our own Federal budget challenges, and we're going to have to fend for ourselves as we shape policy."
He said he welcomed the decision by the United Nations to hold a conference that brings together mayors, academics and business people to talk about cities and regions rather than nations. Two other Mayors, Gene D. B. Roberts of Chattanooga, Tenn., and Kurt L. Schmoke of Baltimore, are also in the 42-member United States delegation.
"As you look at this changing world, cities will become increasingly dominant players," Mr. Lashukta said. "Each of us is at a different stage of this evolution. But in a shrinking world, there is no place that is not reachable even by inland cities like Columbus. There are a number of things we can talk about. We can learn from each other."
The conference caps five years of United Nations meetings on social concerns: conferences on environment in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, human rights in Vienna in 1993, population in Cairo in 1994, poverty in Copenhagen in 1995 and women's issues in Beijing the same year.
"If we follow the Rio message of thinking globally but acting locally, no conference is more important," Ms. Kimble said, adding that all social pressures "are incubated and magnified in cities."
For centuries, politicians and poets alike have looked for a country's pulse in its heartland, and the roots of its people in rural soil. Even if that was mostly a romantic myth, it was based on fact: Only 50 years ago, less than a third of the world's people lived in cities.
But by early in the next century at least half the world's people will live in urban areas. By 2025, five billion people, two-thirds of the world's expected population of 8 billion to 9 billion, will be in cities, most of them in poor countries where local governments are usually underfinanced and badly run.
The consequences are staggering in almost every field, say dozens of experts who have issued reports before the Istanbul conference.
The environment goes first. Ninety percent of raw sewage from urban areas in the developing world is pouring into streams and oceans, the World Resources Institute says in a new report. The world's second most populous country, India, has more than 3,000 towns and cities, but only 8 have full treatment plants.
Land available for staple grain crops is shrinking as urbanization and industrialization -- as well as the building of recreational amenities like the ubiquitous golf courses in Asia -- encroach on rural areas, Worldwatch Institute says in its latest report.
Cities are increasingly populated by young, unemployed men, creating a climate for rising crime, political violence and the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, including the virus that causes AIDS, several United Nations agencies report.
Of the world's 5.8 billion people (increasing by 86 million a year) more than 600 million are homeless or living in inadequate, unsafe and unhealthy housing, about one-sixth of them women and their children. Every year, more women are driven to migrate, as men traditionally were, by worsening poverty and shortages of food in overpopulated farming villages reaching the limits of their productivity.
The ranking of cities is rapidly shifting. The New York metropolitan area was the world's largest in 1950 and third-largest in 1995. According to United Nations projections, it will drop to 11th place by 2015, behind Tokyo; Bombay, India; Lagos, Nigeria; Shanghai; Jakarta, Indonesia; Sao Paulo, Brazil; Karachi, Pakistan; Beijing; Dhaka, Bangladesh, and Mexico City.
Unlike most Latin American, Asian and Middle Eastern countries, where old cities remain the main population centers, the United States has an unusually large number of "new" cities that are growing. In the 1980's, the metropolitan areas of Dallas-Forth Worth, Houston, Miami, Seattle, Atlanta, San Diego, Phoenix and Tampa-St. Petersburg all grew by 20 percent or more.
"Over the last few decades, both the United States and Canada experienced a much more rapid and fundamental reordering of their population and urban systems than Europe," says a United Nations document prepared for the conference. "The North American continent and its cities are clearly in flux; its urban systems, metropolitan forms and suburban landscapes are still in the making."

HEADLINE: Surveys Rate Nigeria as Most Corrupt Nation for Business

 BODY:
Nigeria tops the list of countries that international business people consider the most corrupt, according to a ranking published yesterday by a Berlin-based independent organization, Transparency International.
Fifty-four countries involved in international business are ranked by Transparency International in its second annual corruption index. The rankings are based on results from 10 surveys made by management and risk-analysis organizations as well as on information volunteered by representatives of international companies through the Internet. 
 After Nigeria, business people ranked Pakistan, Kenya, Bangladesh, China, Cameroon, Venezuela, Russia, India and Indonesia as the most corrupt countries.
The 10 least corrupt countries this year were New Zealand, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Canada, Norway, Singapore, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Australia.
The United States was judged the 15th-least-corrupt place, with a slightly worse reputation than Israel but better than Austria.
The findings, stored and analyzed at Gottingen University in Germany, report perceptions of people in international business, mostly from industrialized nations, who deal regularly with foreign companies and governments.

HEADLINE: Chinese Pirate Factories Have Roots Abroad, U.S. Study Says

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 2

 BODY:
A detailed study by the Clinton Administration of Chinese factories that are pirating billions of dollars worth of American software, music and videos shows that almost all the operations are partly owned by foreign companies, some of them working from nations that are close allies and trading partners of the United States.
The list has been circulating in recent days among American companies with enormous stakes in the outcome of the latest confrontation between Beijing and Washington. 
 The United States has warned China that it will impose 100 percent tariffs on $2 billion to $3 billion in Chinese goods on June 17 unless the factories are shut down and other steps are taken to enforce a 16-month-old agreement on the protection of American intellectual property that is being copied and exported by Chinese factories.
A small team of American negotiators headed to China over the weekend, after officials there indicated that they wanted to reopen talks. A session is scheduled for late in the week.
While the threat of American sanctions has been directed at Beijing, the Administration's sanctions list raises the question of whether China bears sole responsibility for the theft of the American-made goods, which range from recordings of Michael Jackson's music to copies of Windows 95 and other popular American software.
And although China is the site of the pirating operations -- which are often partly owned by the Chinese military or by other Government agencies -- the foreign investors in those operations come largely from Hong Kong and Taiwan. Two of the factories appear to be part-owned by interests from Singapore or Japan.
The acting United States trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky, said on Friday that her office was working with Hong Kong and Taiwan to bar the shipment to any factory in China of key equipment that enables the copying of disks. The participation of outsiders, she argued, did not relieve Beijing of responsibility to stop the pirating.
"One cannot excuse Chinese inaction simply because there are foreign investors," Ms. Barshefsky said. "They should be closed down because the Chinese committed to closing them down, and because they are in violation of Chinese laws."
None of the United States' allies has agreed to join the sanctions against China, even though the piracy also costs Japanese and German companies millions of dollars. A few, including Japan, have made it clear that they consider the American threats of sanctions against China unwise. Canada and Mexico have expressed similar views on the tightened American embargo of Cuba.
The detailed list of the 31 factories and scores of companies said to be involved in piracy was prepared by the United States trade representative's office, Administration officials say, to try to give China a road map of what it must do in the next two weeks to avoid the imposition of sanctions.
"We didn't want to hear the excuse that they couldn't find the offenders," a senior official said. "By handing them the list, we are doing everything but picking their officials up and taking them to the factory door."
In recent days Chinese authorities have announced another crackdown on the plants that illegally copy tens of thousands of disks each day, but they have closed only a handful.
Under a commonly discussed scenario for a settlement, China will close 13 or so of the most egregious violators in the next two weeks and agree to a schedule for closing the rest. It would also step up enforcement and inspections at the border to stop export of illegal goods.
American officials say they assume that China wants to avoid a confrontation at a time Congress is considering the annual renewal of China's broader trading benefits, known as most-favored-nation status. President Clinton has notified Congress that he wants to renew the preferential trading status, which the United States extends to virtually all its other trade partners. Congress has 60 days to reject that request.
An unknown factor is who in the Chinese leadership is making the decisions. Some Chinese officials have said that it is time to stand up to American economic muscle, meeting sanctions with counter-sanctions against American goods or companies operating in China.
While sanctions could lead to a further deterioration of United States relations with Beijing, signing a partial deal to get the plants closed could prove politically tricky for Mr. Clinton. He has entered into an agreement with China that called for the closing of all the plants by last July, and that deadline was ignored.
If a new deal produces little result, the Administration will be open to further criticism from Senator Bob Dole, the presumed Republican Presidential nominee, along the lines that Mr. Clinton has been a paper tiger with the Chinese, threatening harsh action but failing to follow through.
Recent charges that state-owned Chinese companies have exported nuclear material to Pakistan and tried to smuggle automatic weapons to the United States "puts more pressure on us to show that any deal we reach is really airtight," an Administration official said recently.
The American list of pirate factories includes the names, locations, and phone and fax numbers of each of 31 plants -- most of them in Guangdong province in south China -- that Washington says are the sources of the majority of counterfeit compact disks and CD-ROM software. Frequently, the high-capacity CD-ROM's are stuffed with many different programs worth thousands of dollars; such compilation disks are often sold on the streets of Shanghai or Hong Kong for $5 to $20. China has recently begun exporting the disks aggressively, chiefly through Southeast Asia.
Among the names of foreign companies on the list are some that sound as if they have a link to the United States -- the "U.S.-Sino Foreign Development Company," an investor in a large factory in the Shenzhen special economic zone near Hong Kong, or the "American Yinyun Company" But officials say that so far, they have found no connections to owners in the United States. The Government list does not include any of the underground factories that are not registered with the Chinese Government, but that also appear to be active in copying American products.
Some corporate executives who have reviewed the list say that many of the names are familiar, and involve Chinese companies that are fronts for Beijing Government agencies or the military. Some of the foreign investors, they assert, have been involved in other piracy activities.
"We've seen cases where factories had been operating in Taiwan, stealing our video games," said Lynn Hvalsoe, general counsel of Nintendo of America, the United States subsidiary of the Japanese game manufacturer. "When things got too hot, they disassembled the factory and rebuilt it in China."
Ms. Hvalsoe said in a recent interview that a few weeks ago Nintendo persuaded the Chinese authorities to raid a factory that was illegally reproducing video games, saturating the Chinese market with fake Game Boy machines. Soon after the raid started, she said, a factory manager informed the investigators that the factory was partly owned by the Chinese military. The factory is still operating.

HEADLINE: Mackinac Island Journal;
At a Tourist Resort, Us vs. Them Sentiments

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: MACKINAC ISLAND, Mich., June 2

 BODY:
For anyone accustomed to the sharp-edged wit of big cities, last week's humor column in the local newspaper of this quaint resort was pretty tame.
Stu Stuart, the columnist and a stand-up comedian working here this summer as a porter at the local ferry docks, listed a series of questions asked endlessly by summer tourists. He then provided sarcastic replies that weary islanders in their T-shirt stores and renowned fudge shops could offer in the future. 
 "Do you have much crime on the Island?" was one question, for which the suggested, inaccurate answer was: "Bike-by fudgings are, unfortunately, all too common on the Island. Gone are the days when you could stroll down the street without getting thwacked on the back of the head with a fudge clod."
But while the humor may have been mild, the reaction of local residents on Mackinac Island (pronounced MACK-ih-naw) was not. The column stirred resentment against the small army of young summer workers like Mr. Stuart who show up in their traditional community each year. Residents have complained to Mr. Stuart, who is 32 years old, and to the newspaper, and are still fuming in their stores.
"Tourists are our bread and butter, and I don't think we should be making fun of them," said Melanie A. Hagenbaugh, a lifelong resident who runs a 70-year-old family drug store here. "I don't like these young pipsqueaks who come here for the summer and leave and we never hear from them again."
Margaret M. Doud, the island's Mayor for 21 years, said that she spoke for most of the permanent residents in disapproving of the column. "The bottom line is, if people can't say something nice about Mackinac Island, they shouldn't say anything," said Ms. Doud, whose father, grandfather and great-uncle all served as Mayor before her.
"We have to be tourist-oriented because that's our industry and that's our living," added Ms. Doud, who owns the Windermere Hotel here.
The island's economy has evolved over the last two centuries from fur trading to fudge making. A large and wealthy fur-trading post was established here in 1780, and its fort, which still stands, was the scene of fighting early in the War of 1812. During the late 19th century, the island turned into a freshwater version of Cape May, N.J., full of Victorian inns and homes with big porches, long wood balconies and a few conical turrets.
But this three-mile-long island, located nearly 300 miles north of Detroit, goes even further in nostalgia than Cape May.
Cars and trucks were banned in 1896, after lobbying then by carriage operators, so residents and visitors must walk, bicycle or ride in one of the numerous horse-drawn taxis.
Even top automobile company executives at a conference here this weekend were delighted by an island without cars. "I think it's neat," said Robert Eaton, the chairman and chief executive of the Chrysler Corporation, after a horse-drawn carriage brought him from the air strip to the sumptuous Grand Hotel here. "I lived in Europe for four years with pedestrian areas where you don't drive, and I don't have any problem with that -- I like it."
But as the annual tide of tourists visiting the island has grown to nearly 1 million people, tensions have developed that are common to many of the beach resorts that Americans will flock to this summer. The 500 permanent residents here who brave the blizzards and isolation of winter now hire 3,000 or so young men and women each summer to wait on the tourists, make their beds and even sweep up after the horses. The permanent residents, while profiting from the tourist tide, are reluctant to admit the summer workers into their fairly conservative community.
Rosemary L. Lounsbury, the 52-year-old owner of the Indian Drum, a store that sells rainbow-hued Indian blankets, brown peace pipes, daggers and other collectibles, said that in her 35 years on the island, the local weekly had never published a more offensive piece than Mr. Stuart's column. "I don't think he meant it to be offensive, but it was," she said.
By contrast, some summer workers were amused by the column. Brian M. Russell, a 23-year-old in a black leather jacket and blue sweat pants who has come here for three straight summers to rent bicycles, pinned the column up in the tiny rental office. "It was funny, just all-around funny," he said.
Mr. Stuart has a handful of fans here even among full-time residents, like Leonard V. Trankina, the 55-year-old executive director of the local chamber of commerce. But Mr. Trankina moved here only 15 years ago, which makes him a newcomer by local standards, and his bluntness makes some of his neighbors uncomfortable.
"It's true we're a little weird here," he said, leaning forward in his chair and pulling up his dark blue cotton trousers to reveal that he was wearing a blue ankle sock and a brown one. "See, I don't wear matching socks."
The controversy comes at a time when the island's permanent residents are trying to discourage the use of the slightly derogatory nicknames that they and summer employees have applied to tourists. The sunburned, brightly clad masses in the streets have long been known as "fudgies," for example, for their propensity to gobble down huge chunks of the chocolate goo.
Visitors from south of the Mackinac Bridge, which connects lower and upper Michigan where Lake Huron meets Lake Michigan, are known as "trolls," because they live below the bridge. But discouraging the use of the term is difficult because many visitors proudly adopt it.
"I'm a troll, too," said Gov. John Engler, a Republican. Like Mr. Eaton, Governor Engler came to the island this weekend for the annual conference of the Greater Detroit Chamber of Commerce.
As for Mr. Stuart, whose legal name is Ford L. Stuart 3d, he claims to be unrepentant about disturbing the town's elders. But this week's column is a tame account of the local Boy Scout troop's overnight visit to a nearby lighthouse, where they ate too much chili before going to sleep.
The column makes no mention of tourists.

HEADLINE: Summer Village Regrets a Chilling Event

BYLINE: By DAVID STOUT 

DATELINE: WESTHAMPTON BEACH, L.I., June 2

 BODY:
Amid all the voices on the sun-splashed streets and sidewalks of this village by the ocean, the most eloquent words today were silent ones.
"God bless Shane Daniels" read signs in the windows of a dozen shops and stores. And nowhere, it seemed, was that sentiment felt more deeply than in Joan Boyce's jewelry store. Her business is practically across the street from the bar where Shane L. Daniels, 21, was nearly beaten to death a week ago in what investigators say was a fight with a New York City police detective and several other white men. 
 "This is a wonderful community," Mrs. Boyce said, taking time out from waiting on customers who pay $3,000 and up for her jewelry. She felt strongly enough about the goodness in the community, and bad enough about the beating that nearly killed the young black man, that she started a fund to help pay for Mr. Daniels's medical expenses.
In a real sense, there may be no one in Westhampton Beach better able to talk about what kind of community it is, and how the people feel about what happened. Mrs. Boyce has run her jewelry store for 22 years, much longer than many merchants in the village. And though she is reluctant to talk much about it, she acknowledged today that, yes, she is probably in as good a position as anyone to talk about bigotry.
Mrs. Boyce is Jewish and is married to a black man. Her husband, Allan, was a junior high school principal in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, for more than three decades. Mrs. Boyce was a junior high teacher before starting her jewelry business.
And she is not one to believe the worst about a police officer without knowing all the facts: she has a close relative on the New York City force.
Today, Mrs. Boyce insisted that she was not thinking much about her own life, but rather about that of Shane Daniels. The fund she set up through Home Federal Bank on Main Street has already collected several thousand dollars, she said.
As for outsiders, those who go to Westhampton Beach only for the fast-burning summer season or out of curiosity now that the village has had a brush with the headlines, Mrs. Boyce said, "They should not hold it against the community."
And what kind of community is it? Does it belong to Mrs. Boyce's customers, or to the 16-year-old black girl who spoke freely but would not give her name? "Mostly friendly," the girl said, looking back on the three years she has lived in the village. She hopes to leave the village for nursing school in a year or two and hopes to forget the time someone in a passing car yelled a racial slur.
Murray Sell has lived in the village since 1960, long enough to see some changes he does not like. Too many "day trippers" visit to show off their money and make noise, in his view. "There, that's part and parcel of it," Mr. Sell said as a long black limousine drove by.
A moment later, three motorcycles driven by bearded young men went by in an ear-splitting roar of vengeance. "We never had that before, either," Mr. Sell said.
Mr. Sell, an architectural consultant, traced much of the change to tourism, the village's blessing and bane. There is no doubt in anyone's mind, in the real estate offices or in the trendy ice cream shops, cafes and boutiques, that the money from beachgoers drives the local economy.
It also drives up the population, from some 1,500 in the off-season to perhaps twice that between Memorial Day and Labor Day -- "people who come to get away from the city," one real estate agent put it.
Last weekend, a bit of the kind of violence that most people here would associate with "the City" came to this little village. Mrs. Boyce and others know whom they blame: the owners of Club Marakesh, where a night of drinking preceded the near-fatal encounter in the parking lot.
In recent months, a group of business leaders and others prominent in village life had been pushing to have Marakesh closed down (as it was today, in honor of Mr. Daniels, a sign on its door said).
But one problem that Mrs. Boyce and other merchants have often linked to Marakesh, under-age drinking, was apparently not a factor in the beating of Mr. Daniels. While club officials could not be reached to comment on the allegations of underage drinking, the State Liquor Authority has issued two citations to the club for serving alcohol to minors.
And what of the young people who flock to Westhampton Beach, with money and exuberance to spend? "It's wonderful to look at them," said Margaret Shapiro, who spends the warm months in the village, then goes to Florida with her husband, Nathan, a retired lawyer. "They're delicious to see."
This is still a village where the police officers smile behind their sunglasses even as they refuse to talk about the events of a week ago. The big problems this time of year: "Traffic, U-turns, wearing bathing suits on the streets," one officer said. Oh, yes: late at night, there is occasional public urination, he added.
On the streets today, several black teen-age youths had a friendly conversation with several white teen-age girls. The only tension between them seemed to be about how to spend a lazy Sunday afternoon.
In Joan Boyce's jewelry shop, a woman was arguing with herself over whether to buy a $4,200 or a $3,900 necklace. Mrs. Boyce said she had nothing personal against the owner of Marakesh, that she and her husband used to go there years ago before the crowd became rougher and younger.
And what of her feelings about Shane Daniels? "He's anybody's child."

HEADLINE: POLITICAL STAKES INCREASE IN FIGHT TO SAVE MEDICARE

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 2

 BODY:
The political war over the future of Medicare, a cannonade of oratory and statistical rotten tomatoes that has already thoroughly spattered both parties, is about to resume. And with near-religious fervor, for this time, control of both Congress and the Presidency could turn on the outcome.
On Wednesday, the trustees of the $200 billion-a-year Medicare system are expected to confirm warnings by the Congressional Budget Office that the program is going broke faster than ever. 
 Republican leaders in Congress say they plan to blame President Clinton, who vetoed legislation last year that would have restrained Medicare spending.
The White House will accuse the Republicans once more of trying to decimate health care for retirees to raise money for tax cuts for the rich, leading Democrats say.
Lost in the fight are the two serious proposals that Republicans and Democrats have offered this spring to halt Medicare's fiscal slide. Outside experts say the plans offer a basis for a compromise that would stabilize the program.
Virtually nobody expects such a compromise to occur. One reason is unalloyed politics. Officials on both sides believe that their positions are politically advantageous, and that a compromise would cost them their edge.
The Democrats' strategy is aimed at tightening their hold on the majority of the 33 million potential voters who are 65 or older, and their plan is more generous to the aged. Republicans have cast their appeals in terms of the young, and their plan restrains more spending now in the name of saving for future generations.
But the two plans, while close enough in accounting terms, use opposing methods to reach their mutual goal. The Republican proposal would stabilize Medicare by imposing strict limits on its spending, sometimes in ways that the White House and even some Republicans say could be onerous.
Mr. Clinton would stabilize the program by effectively moving $55 billion in medical expenses out of the Medicare trust funds, and covering them instead with money from the Treasury's general fund.
His mechanism is a tactic that Republicans in the House proposed last year: shifting a substantial portion of the cost of providing home health care out of Medicare's hospital trust fund. The cost would ostensibly be picked up by Medicare's other trust fund, which covers doctors and other patient care outside hospitals. But in fact the Government would use general revenue to pay for it.
The Clinton move is shrewd politically, in that it would prolong Medicare's solvency with fewer unpopular restraints on spending and without a tax increase. Whether it is perfectly sound fiscal policy -- or flagrant fiscal flimflam, as critics charge -- is almost entirely a matter of budgeting ideology.
Republicans tilt toward the flimflam explanation. "More gimmickry," said Senator Spencer Abraham, a Republican from Michigan. Some private experts are skeptical, but less blunt. "You may call this a solution," said Robert D. Reischauer, the Brookings Institution scholar who ran the Congressional Budget Office when Democrats controlled Capitol Hill. "I'd call it a rearrangement of the books."
Others, like Stuart H. Altman, a longtime student of Federal health policy at Brandeis University, are more positive. "The crisis is the Medicare trust fund going bankrupt, and the problem is the long-term deficit," he said in an interview. "I can handle the crisis by making the problem a little worse, and that's what the President did. You can call that gimmickry. I wouldn't."
In the budget debate earlier this year, the two sides attacked each other's proposals in the bluntest of terms. Senator Paul Wellstone, a Minnesota Democrat, indicted the Republicans for "recklessness," while Senator Robert F. Bennett, a Utah Republican, shot back that his party was the only one with the "courage to recognize that Medicare, to be handled as business as usual, is headed for disaster."
But to make any judgment at all about the two plans requires some grounding in the $200-billion-a-year Medicare budget.
Medicare costs are borne by two separate trust funds. The first covers so-called Part A expenses, for all hospital care, and is largely fed by a payroll tax. Over the years, the fund has run up a surplus approaching $126 billion.
The second trust fund, which covers Part B services, like visits to private doctors, gets a quarter of its money from a $42.50-a-month premium paid by everyone enrolled in the program. The other three-fourths comes from the Treasury's general fund, the account that pays to keep most of the Government running.
By definition, the Part B fund never runs a deficit. The Part A fund is another matter: annual expenses began to exceed annual income for the first time in the fiscal year 1995, and the imbalance is accelerating.
A year ago, the trustees of the Medicare system predicted that the Part A fund would go bankrupt in 2002. In April, the Congressional Budget Office said the fund was headed for a 2001 deficit of $25 billion.
The Republicans and the White House have little disagreement over what to do with the Part B trust fund. Each of their six-year proposals for Medicare would reduce projected spending by roughly $44 billion.
It is over Part A that they part ways.
The Republicans would reduce the projected growth of Part A spending by $123 billion through 2002. That total, they say, reflects experts' estimates of the six-year savings needed to fend off bankruptcy of the trust fund until 2007, rather than 2001.
The White House proposal would cut projected spending for Part A services by only $72 billion or so, a full $51 billion less than the Republicans. Even so, it claims to keep the Part A trust fund solvent roughly as long as the Republican plan.
The White House uses ingenuity to make its $72 billion in savings do the work of the Republicans' $123 billion. It would shift much of the cost of one fast-growing Medicare benefit, home health care, out of Part A. The hospital fund would pay for the first 100 visits by home-health-care workers to people who have been discharged from hospitals. The rest would be paid out of the Part B trust fund.
That move would reduce the hospital trust fund's expenses by an additional $55 billion over six years, raising the total savings to $127 billion, or $4 billion more than the Republican plan.
Administration officials say shifting the cost of most home health care to Part B makes both fiscal and practical sense: Most home health care has nothing to do with hospitals. But the shift is largely an accounting device, for the service itself remains unchanged. Beneficiaries would not pay the 20 percent co-payment or the 25 percent premium extracted for other Part B services.
The practical effect would be to make home health care a new class of Medicare: basically free, and largely financed by general tax revenue. As a set of ledger entries, experts say, the plan is unassailable. Paying for home health care from a different Government pocket would ease the trust-fund crisis and free money for hospitals.
The plan also bows to what most experts say is the fiscal truth about Medicare: that trust-fund dollars look and spend exactly like ordinary tax dollars, and that where the money comes from is irrelevant.
"It is arbitrary where you put home health care," said John Rother, the legislative director for the American Association of Retired Persons. "In some respects, this sky-is-falling rhetoric about the Part A trust fund is misplaced. The real question is what we can afford as an economy and what portion of health care we want to pay for."
Yet even some experts, like Mr. Reischauer, who shares that view, say they have qualms about the White House's solution.
They agree that paying for home health care out of general taxpayer revenue would not increase the overall budget deficit. But accounting logic aside, they say, the plan dismisses in one stroke some $55 billion in costs that will remain part of Medicare's overspending problem. Moreover, they say, the plan saps Washington's will to do anything about it.
For while trust funds are only accounting devices, they are effective ones: the looming crisis in Part A has given politicians an excuse to rein in hospital spending and raise Medicare taxes. And the prospect of higher co-payments and insurance premiums has spurred politicians to press for restraints on the cost of outpatient services.
Mr. Clinton's plan would place outside those corrals much of a home-health-care program, whose cost to the Government -- now $17.5 billion a year -- will rise by 17.7 percent in fiscal 1996.
The White House notes that its plan does propose policy changes to slow that explosive growth, even as it frees the program from the trust fund's fiscal contraints.
Mr. Reischauer said he agrees that the program needs an overhaul. But he still wonders whether the Administration's plan would achieve it. "That is less likely to occur," he said, "unless there is some pressure on the Congress to address it."

HEADLINE: Essay;
Netanyahu's 'New Way'

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
"What a landslide!" was President Clinton's telephoned greeting to Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli candidate he worked so hard to defeat.
Though the "landslide" joshing was intended as ironic, in one sense it was true: Among Jewish Israelis, Bibi (the short nickname, like Ike, will stick because headline writers need it) scored a decisive 55 percent victory. 
 Clinton assured the newly elected Prime Minister that he had read his recent book, "Fighting Terrorism," and was recommending it to all his friends. To get right with the Jewish right, he invited the Israeli to Washington this month and Netanyahu accepted; we can expect the Israeli to dine with Bob Dole and Congressional Republicans as well.
To cheering fans last night, Bibi struck the right unity note, declaring that "peace must begin at home"; assuring non-Jewish citizens that he would be "Prime Minister of all the people" (a paraphrase of James Polk's 1845 Inaugural); and extending a hand toward Arab states and Palestinians. And with "the battle is behind us," he wouldn't let partisans shout down his gracious salute to Shimon Peres.
But the Likud leader was not elected to run the country from dead center, or as Peres with a sterner face, or as Begin with TV skills. Netanyahu spoke of " a new way." He will spell out that theme in his acceptance speech to the Knesset, but here are what I believe are its outlines:
1. A new way of governing. As the first P.M. elected not by the parliament but directly by the voters, Netanyahu has the political mandate and executive freedom of action never before possessed by an Israeli leader -- at a time when the Knesset has become both more representative and more coalescable.
Some faces will be familiar: Moshe Arens, Bibi's principled mentor, will be the second most important figure in Israel. Others will come from outside the system: Connecticut-born Dore Gold, 42, emigrated to Israel 18 years ago, is the new P.M.'s foreign-policy alter ego and may set up a national security council staff to coordinate bureaucratic fiefdoms. Don't expect a major crossover as in the days of Dayan.
2. A new way of securing a peace. With Syria, the old way -- offering Assad the Golan in return for a treaty and restrictions on military deployment -- is a nonstarter. Netanyahu is developing an approach to offer Assad security without Israel's departure from the heights. Combined deterrence and negotiation requires patience, as the U.S. learned with the Soviets, but time is not on Syria's side.
Jordan's king welcomed Bibi's win because it means Jerusalem stays undivided under Israeli sovereignty, with control of Islamic sites in Jordan's hands. Reality must lower Palestinian expectations of immediate statehood, but self-governing Palestinian enclaves, accompanied by economic incentives, could co-exist productively with Israel's protected settlements -- if the will can be found to join in overcoming terrorism. And figure Netanyahu to come up with a surprise on the peace front.
3. A new way to close the gap between rich and poor. The only time he said "Listen well" last night was when he pledged emphasis on a free-market economy. I know it's what all new leaders say about Israel's system now barnacled with socialism, but if this one means it, freed enterprise could, as he believes, "loose the genius of our nation." Combined with requirements for equal opportunity in education and hiring, capitalism offers a new way to prosperity for Israel and out of poverty elsewhere in the Middle East.
The newly elected leader is surrounded by what he calls eitses-givers, a combination of Yiddish and English meaning "offerers of advice." The eitses to Bibi from this corner: Accept unpopularity in your first year. By keeping your campaign promises, you'll get bad press but make good history.
A personal word. For 20 years, the policies of Shimon Peres have been criticized in this space, but not once did he refuse me an interview or duck a difficult question. He's a consistent loser of elections, but a genuine political pro. (Now that the job of Secretary General of the U.N. is coming up for grabs, how about an Israeli dove?)

HEADLINE: A Quicker Pace Means No Peace in the Valley

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF 

DATELINE: PALO ALTO, Calif.

 BODY:
Silicon Valley, held in the Internet's thrall, has found a new religion. Its symbols are everywhere -- including the slide that David Hancock recently used to illustrate a sermon to his management team.
"Speed is God," read the slide, as Mr. Hancock, chief executive of the Hitachi Corporation's new portable computer division, began preaching the need to rush out the group's first product. "And time," Mr. Hancock said for emphasis, "is the devil." 
 The frenetic pace of business in the nation's leading high-technology region has become downright fiendish, propelled by the explosive growth and implacable demands of the Internet.
For a variety of reasons, the Internet has severely compressed the business cycle for the chip makers, computer developers and software designers of Silicon Valley. Chief among the causes is the high-speed product development that comes from exchanging ideas and research over the network. But that has also been aided by the dissemination of each incremental new version of software by means of the World Wide Web, and the subsequent hunger for new hardware finetuned to use that software.
The resultant tumult, opportunities and risks are being shared by suppliers, customers and investors throughout the information-technology industry.
"We are now living on Internet time," said Andrew Grove, chief executive of the Intel Corporation. His company, which rose to power in an earlier, more measured high-technology era, is now scrambling to adapt to life at warp speed. "It's a new territory," Mr. Grove said, "and the cyber equivalent of the Oklahoma land rush is on."
Some instigators of this switch in time have been Internet software newcomers like the Netscape Communications Corporation, which set the standard in the industry with its handling of its Navigator browser program. It established the model of giving away unfinished versions of its software to anyone who wants to download it from the Internet.
Software companies -- including the giant Microsoft Corporation -- that once issued new versions of their neatly boxed and shrink-wrapped programs every 18 months to two years now send out raw, untested software three to four times a year via the Internet, just to keep pace.
For the Internet's sibling industries, the pulse has quickened as well. Computer hardware and peripheral companies -- from established players like Intel to start-ups like Mr. Hancock's Hitachi division -- now design business plans so that most of the profit is wrung from a product within its first three months on the market. After that, executives say, so many competing products will have flooded any given niche that no one can make any money.
And venture-capital firms, the financial lifeblood of Silicon Valley, are now interested primarily in start-up companies that plan an 18-month life cycle. Within that span, the idea is to move from concept to first product to an exit strategy -- either by going public with a stock offering, a la the Web-search company Yahoo's $38 million I.P.O. in April, or by selling out to a bigger company, as Surfwatch Inc., a developer of Web-filtering software, did in a $12.6 million buyout by Spyglass Inc.
At Sun Microsystems, a Silicon Valley old-liner that has found a new career in Internet products, progress is now measured in "Web weeks," said Eric Schmidt, Sun's chief technology officer. The company now estimates that 20 percent of its in-house technical knowledge becomes obsolete each year.
But new knowledge can quickly flourish. It was only about a year ago that Sun introduced Java, an entirely new computer language designed specifically for the Internet. Since then, Java has become a runaway hit for Sun, helping raise the company's value in the stock market by more than $6 billion to a market capitalization of more than $11.5 billion.
Chances for a big payoff, of course, have long motivated the engineers and entreprenuers of the Valley to work 16-hour days for months on end to get a new product out the door. But as traditional product cycles give way to an endless stream of upgrades, many people here say that Internet time has removed any semblance of boundaries between home life and work life.
"More people are working at home late into the night even after they come home," said Lenny Siegel, director of the Pacific Studies Center, a non-profit community advocate group in Mountain View, Calif., who is one of Silicon Valley's most vocal gadflies. "It places even greater strains on people who are trying to have lives outside of work."
There is little choice, however, for people working for companies caught in a competitive cycle in which a lost week or month can prove to be a business disaster.
"Stop for lunch and you are lunch," said Paul Saffo, an industry consultant and director of the Institute for the Future in Menlo Park, Calif. "I think software engineers now understand what it's like to be an options trader on Wall Street."
And yet, according to one executive, Scott Love, the constant start-up mode can mean "you have more control over your time, even if you're working longer hours -- nobody asks you why you weren't in by 8 A.M."
Mr. Love has gone through three start-ups in five years, including the Netcode Corporation, a Java software tools developer that he sold to Netscape earlier this year just six-and-a-half months after founding it.
Electronic mail helps him control when and where he works, said Mr. Love, who is now a product marketing director for Netscape. And he helps balance work and family life by making sure his driving commute is "less than 10 minutes each day."
For big corporations, adopting the new, truncated timetables can require a little shock therapy.
When Mr. Hancock of Hitachi agreed to run the new portable PC company in January, he decided to shoot for a new generation of computers every six months -- not every two years, as was the PC-industry norm as recently as 1994. So he traveled to Japan soon after to begin planning new products for the 133-megahertz version of the Pentium chip that Intel was set to introduce.
"How long would it take for Hitachi to have a complete computer designed around the chip?" Mr. Hancock asked the team of engineers he met there.
"By early May should be possible," the team leader answered.
Mr. Hancock, a British citizen and former Apple Computer executive who approaches his work with the zeal of a rugby player, began swearing at the group, before countering, "How about by next Wednesday?"
The demand stunned the engineers, Mr. Hancock said. But by the following week, he had his new computer and Hitachi was able, along with such elite players in portable computers as I.B.M, Compaq and AST Research, to announce its new system in time for the new Intel chip.
The race is even more frantic in software.
Microsoft, whose software development, testing and marketing cycles sometimes stretched over two years, is now sprinting to keep up with Netscape, whose Navigator leads the Web-browser sector.
"This market obsoletes itself every few quarters," said Eric Hahn, senior vice president of enterprise technology at Netscape, which has introduced three completely new versions of Navigator, since the company's founding in late 1994.
"Today, a product that takes two years to develop is probably irrelevant," Mr. Hahn said.
And useless to customers, in all likelihood. Even now, the earliest versions of Netscape's Navigator cannot interact with some Web sites that are based on the latest versions.
Trying to catch up, Microsoft in the past year has introduced three versions of its competing software, Internet Explorer. The latest, a "beta" or test version, was released just last week -- with a more complete beta version to be available later this month.
"It's like they just opened the border to Oklahoma and we're running in as fast as we can to get that choice piece of land by the river," said John Ludwig, the Microsoft vice president in charge of the company's Explorer Web-browser development. So far, though, Netscape controls most of the waterfront property.
For Mr. Schmidt, of Sun Microsystems, the struggle between Microsoft and Netscape is evidence of a new economy and a new set of rules.
"Market-share capture is now the leading measure of whether you're successful or not," he said. "This is different from classical markets in economics because of the nature of the medium of the Internet. You can make a million pieces of software for the same cost as one copy. It is that difference that distinguishes what we do from traditional manufacturing industries. They can't play this game."
No one is certain, of course, how the game will end. Some experts believe the Internet boom is simply the latest phase for Silicon Valley, which will inevitably be followed by a crash and the emergence of the next business model. But some argue that the Internet has brought profound and lasting change to the Valley.
"This is as an intense time as I can remember," said Bill Duvall, an Internet pioneer who once was a programmer at SRI International and Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center.
Sixteen months ago, Mr. Duvall, with his wife Ann and their friend Jay Friedland founded Surfwatch, a developer of Internet software for screening out pornographic material on the Web. In April, they sold the company to Spyglass.
Mr. Duvall, a long-distance runner when he has the time, described those 16 months as the intellectual equivalent of running a marathon. "You can't eat enough," he said, continuing the analogy. "You start burning muscle."
At Intel, Mr. Grove is still staying the course. But he says that living on Internet time is nothing like the comparably leisurely early days of the the PC industry in the late 1970's and early 1980's.
"There is a remarkable amount of ferment in Silicon Valley now," Mr. Grove said. "It's wonderful -- but it's also bewildering."

HEADLINE: 'Real Peace With Security': Parts of Netanyahu's Speech

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, June 2

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from a speech by Benjamin Netanyahu, Prime Minister-elect of Israel, to his supporters today, as translated from the Hebrew. 
 My friends, the state of Israel is going a new way: a way of hope, a way of unity, a path of security, a path of peace. The first and most important peace that should be made is the peace within Israel, the peace between us.
This is the most important challenge at this time. In the last few years, the division in Israeli society has widened, and the tensions have increased between various parts of society.
My dear friends, I see my first mission as Prime Minister to reunite the people, to reduce the tensions and to strengthen the unity of the people. And I want to say to you this evening that the peace must start at home. . . .
I call on the citizens of Israel, the non-Jewish citizens of the state of Israel. I want to say to them, I see you as part and equal in everything that goes on in the state of Israel.
I call on all the public in Israel, those who voted for me and those who didn't, and I say to you, I plan to be the Prime Minister of everyone without any exception.
The peace that we will bring will not be the peace for the Likud voters, but for everyone. The security will be for everyone. Wealth will be for everyone. The economic prosperity will be for everyone. . . .
My friends, I said that the peace begins at home, but we must continue it outside of Israel. And we plan to advance the peace and the negotiating process with all of our neighbors in order to get a stable peace, a real peace, peace with security. . . .
This evening I stretch out my hand in peace to all the Arab leaders and all of our neighbors, our Palestinian neighbors. I call on you to join us on the road to real peace with security. Let us go in a way of security for everyone, for all the nations of the region. The government we will form in a few days, with God's help, will strengthen the peaceful relations that have already been established with the Jordanian kingdom and with Egypt, and will continue negotiations with the Palestinians, and we also try to advance the negotiations with other Arab states. I call on those states to join the peace process.
I see our friend, the United States, as part of the peace process. The relations between the United States and Israel are strong as a rock, and I am sure that they will continue in the coming four years. . . .
We believe every citizen in Israel should have equality so that he can fulfill his utmost. We will -- and listen well -- we have been saying it for a long time but listen very well to what I'm saying. We are planning to finally implement a free market economy that is not controlled by large bodies and not by bureaucrats, an economy that does not hold up the country. . . .
Only if there is a strong economy can you worry about the poor people, and we will help the poor people, and we will close the gap between the rich and the poor in this country.
I was in Tamra a few days ago with a number of my friends here. There was a small child, and I saw him, and I told him to come near me, and I put my hand around him. This child should get all opportunities that my son, Yair, should get. This Arab child should get the same opportunities that my child, Yair, has. . . .
There will not be two Israels or a third Israel. There will be one, united Israel with opportunity for everyone -- equal opportunity for everyone.
The Jewish past is not only for us; it is also the basis for our future. And it is also the basis for our existence and for our connections and ties with the Diaspora Jews, and therefore we will work to strengthen our history and our connection with the land of Israel, and we will work to safeguard Jerusalem, a united Jerusalem under Israeli sovereignty.
I declare this evening in Jerusalem, the eternal capital of the Jewish people and the city that will never be divided again. . . .
I want to express a special thanks to Prime Minister Shimon Peres.
Ladies and gentlemen, my friends, this battle is behind us. Now we are in a new era of unity. This means in every part of society.
I want to say of Mr. Peres: We were deeply divided, but no one should forget Mr. Peres and the contributions he made for Israel in the last 50 years. Mr. Peres, the nation of Israel will know to thank you.

HEADLINE: Accounts Put Only One Officer at Scene of L.I. Beating

BYLINE: By N. R. KLEINFIELD 

DATELINE: WESTHAMPTON BEACH, L.I., June 2

 BODY:
A man who was with a New York City police detective accused in the beating of a young black man outside a nightclub here said through his lawyer today that there were no other police officers in their group of four. He has also agreed to testify without immunity before a grand jury.
As the man, Austin Offen, laid out considerable new details about the beating, the detective, Constantine Chronis, also contended in an account he related to a jailhouse visitor that no other officers were among the people he was with that night. 
 With the assault case against the detective expected to come before a grand jury tomorrow, Mr. Offen's account veers markedly from what has been depicted by other witnesses as an unprovoked racial attack. He maintains that there were two simultaneous scuffles that evening.
Eight days after the May 26 beating, the narrative of precisely what happened early that Sunday morning has gotten steadily murkier rather than clearer. Each new piece of evidence, rather than moving the puzzle toward completion, seems to confirm just how multidimensional the puzzle is. But the unanswered question of whether more than one police officer was embroiled in the beating is a crucial one for the New York City Police Department.
Police officials said yesterday that they had not ruled out the possibility that other officers were there that night, but that there was still no solid evidence or leads linking any officers other than Mr. Chronis. Internal affairs investigators said they have shown more than 100 photographs of possible police companions to witnesses, but have not produced any leads. A spokesman for the Suffolk County District Attorney's office declined to comment on the case.
At a press conference this afternoon in Garden City, L.I., Dominic Barbara, a lawyer representing Mr. Offen, who acknowledged spending that Saturday evening with Mr. Chronis, said his client would testify without immunity before the grand jury.
Mr. Barbara gave this account of the events: Mr. Offen, 25, of Floral Park, L.I., an unemployed construction worker and a student at Nassau Community College, was friends with a man from Staten Island whom Mr. Barbara identified only as "Vinnie." Mr. Offen had met Mr. Chronis for the first time the day before, playing basketball at a friend's house. Then, on Saturday, Mr. Offen, Vinnie and a friend of Vinnie's whom Mr. Offen did not know and whom Mr. Barbara called "Frank" traveled in Vinnie's car to Detective Chronis' house in Hicksville.
In two cars, the four men drove to Westhampton. Mr. Barbara said that neither Frank nor Vinnie was a police officer.
After stopping at -- but not entering -- two other clubs, he said, they went to Club Marakesh. There, they mixed with others who were drinking champagne and smoking cigars; Mr. Barbara said that the men may have known this group "from body-building." They left the club and as Mr. Offen got into Vinnie's car, it was surrounded by several black men. Two fights erupted virtually simultaneously, one pitting Mr. Offen and one of the other white men against a group of black men, and the other pitting Mr. Chronis and the fourth man against a separate group of black men. Mr. Barbara said he does not know what touched off the fights or who started them. "There is no doubt that this is an incident that occurred between two races," he said. But he said Mr. Offen uttered no racial slurs.
As Mr. Offen got out of the car, Mr. Barbara said, he was beaten to the ground and struck with a tire jack. "He was bleeding profusely," Mr. Barbara said. He noted that Mr. Offen was a "big, tough kid" at 6-foot-1. He said Mr. Offen was unaware of what transpired in the second fight. "There was another incident to his left," he said. "He's not there, he can't see it."
He said that the men clambered into Mr. Chronis' car, leaving Vinnie's car in the parking lot, and then drove away. The four men -- some of them bloodied -- then drove together to Queens. Mr. Barbara declined to say what was discussed on the hour-and-a-half ride there. Mr. Offen then got out and went to North Shore Medical Center, Mr. Barbara said, where he received 17 stitches over his eye. He said Mr. Offen also has a gouge in his head.
"As far as my client is concerned, he was in a fight," Mr. Barbara said. "He was injured and he was bruised. These were no kids. This was all adults. This was not a kids' fight; this was a serious brawl."
Mr. Barbara also confirmed that Mr. Offen is on probation for an assault that took place in Queens more than two years ago.
Mr. Barbara's account represents the first insinuation that the white men opposed a group as large as 15. While members of the group that included Shane L. Daniels, the 21-year-old Riverhead man who was beaten, have not specifically said how many of them stood in that parking lot, they have mentioned only six black men and one white woman.
Mr. Chronis has said nothing publicly beyond pleading not guilty. However, a person who visited him in jail, and who talked on the condition of anonymity today, gave the first suggestions of Mr. Chronis's version of the evening, which were similar to those of Mr. Offen's. This person said that Mr. Chronis conveyed this brief account: He was in the Hamptons with civilian friends for the Memorial Day weekend because he was having domestic problems. He lives in Hicksville, L.I., with his wife and two small children. He and these friends went to Marakesh, where they met some other men, who were drinking champagne, and joined them. None of them was a police officer. Out in the parking lot, according to this version, they were set upon by a group of black men, and Mr. Chronis was hit in the head. He denies that he struck Mr. Daniels.
With these bits and pieces of fresh details starting to appear, investigators apparently are still unsure of key elements at the very foundation of the case that has drawn such widespread attention. The authorities have heard colliding accounts of whether Mr. Chronis is the one who actually used an anti-theft bar to beat Mr. Daniels into unconsciousness, or whether he displayed a gun to hold friends of Mr. Daniels at bay while an accomplice clubbed him. Conflicting stories have also emerged over what triggered the assault, who hit whom first and what the numerical dimensions were of the two sides in the confrontation.
Part of the reason that a case in which there are ample witnesses remains so clouded is the fact that thus far, most of the witnesses have said little or nothing publicly about what happened in the parking lot. And what little they have said has not yet coalesced into any consistent picture.
Five black men and a white women have acknowledged being with Mr. Daniels at Marakesh on the night of the beating, and all of them have said that they witnessed the episode. Two of them have given brief sworn depositions. One has elaborated somewhat beyond the deposition and one of the others has spoken on the condition of anonymity. The others have remained silent on the advice of their parents and the authorities, and they and their parents have indicated that they have passed through their own grueling anguish over the past week.
All of the witnesses with Mr. Daniels are being jointly represented by a New York lawyer, and they were at a rally here yesterday that was organized by the Rev. Al Sharpton. However, none of the witnesses spoke.
The Daniels group has depicted the unfolding of the events quite opposite to what Mr. Barbara asserted. One of them said that members of the two groups had exchanged some harsh words inside the club and then, out in the parking lot, the white men goaded and then attacked them. Several of them asked why the white men fled and vanished, including a police officer, if they were in fact the victims.
Both Mandel Pettus, 22, who works at a home for the mentally ill and depicts himself as Mr. Daniels's best friend, and Vincent Briggs, 21, a landscaper and friend of Mr. Daniels, said in sworn depositions that as they made their way to their cars in the parking lot across from Marakesh, the Chronis group began taunting them with racial epithets and then attacked them.
Mr. Briggs said that a man who tore off his shirt took a swing at him, but he ducked. Both of them said that someone drew a gun and held their group at bay while a man without a shirt repeatedly clubbed Mr. Daniels on the head with the anti-theft bar. The two friends picked Mr. Chronis out of a line-up and identified him as participating in the attack, and they said in their depositions that he looked like the man who beat Mr. Daniels. Furthermore, Mr. Briggs has described the man who was wielding the gun as having a blondish mustache. When he was arrested, Mr. Chronis did not have a mustache.
Neither deposition mentions any punches being thrown by the members of the black group.
The one other account that has come forth is from a member of the black group who spoke on condition of anonymity. He said that a fistfight erupted between the two groups, but it was instigated by the white men, who called them racial slurs and began hitting them.
He also said that he was certain that Mr. Chronis was the man with the gun, not the shirtless man who did the beating.
Witnesses have said that the white men were drinking heavily throughout the night at Marakesh, and were acting rowdy toward others. The authorities said the men were involved in two smaller mishaps inside the club. Witnesses said the group consumed a number of bottles of champagne, were smoking expensive cigars and were behaving in an emphatically macho manner.
Mr. Daniels' friends believe that what incensed the white men was the fact that a 19-year-old white woman was accompanying them. She is Jamie DeGregorio, who is Mr. Pettus's girlfriend. Before the fight began, Mr. Daniels walked a white woman who works at the club, Lisha Jones, to her car. But she was parked in a different lot across the street from where the beating occurred, and it is unclear if the white group was even aware of that cordiality. Ms. Jones said she left the scene before the fight broke out.
During a commencement address at St. John's University Law School yesterday morning, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani defended the conduct of New York City police officers who he said had performed admirably during recent racially charged incidents in Crown Heights and on Staten Island. Asked about reports that other police officers may have been involved in the Long Island beating, the Mayor said that he did not know all the facts since Suffolk prosecutors were handling the investigation.
"It doesn't really matter if it's one or more than one," he said in a news conference after his speech. "One person allegedly acting like that is too many. And the Police Commissioner and I pledge ourselves to try to eliminate any action like that by police officers. You can't absolutely achieve that but you have to keep trying. One police officer who acts in a way that is brutal to someone, allegedly based on a person's race, is one police officer too many."
Mr. Daniels began to come out of a coma today but remains in stable but critical condition at University Hospital in Stony Brook, L.I. In the days since he was beaten, his friends who witnessed the beating said that they have been emotionally wrung out by the crime and the spotlight that has been shone on them. Several of his friends have said that they are having trouble sleeping, eating and working.
Curtis Daniels, the father of the victim, said today that he did not believe there were any wider conclusions to be drawn about blacks and officers from this single incident. He added that his son would not want the episode to be wrapped in racial politics, for he did not see the world in terms of race.

NEW YORK
An Unraveling Crackdown
The United States Immigration and Naturalization Service has recently declared war on illegal employment in New York City's garment industry. The agency's raids on garment factories have inspired a stream of news releases heralding the number of factories hit (86) and workers caught (1,228). But the news releases do not describe what immigration officials, economists and workers themselves say happens after the raids. Most of the workers are released the same day and are usually not deported. Some go back to the very factories where they were picked up; others move to other factories or to industries in which there is no crackdown. [Page A1.]
 
New Accounts of L.I. Beating
A man who was with a New York City police detective accused in the beating of a young black man outside a nightclub in Westhampton Beach, L.I., said through his lawyer that there were no other police officers in their group of four, and he has agreed to testify without immunity before a grand jury. The account of the man, Austin Offen, veers markedly from what has been depicted as an unprovoked racial attack. The detective, Constantine Chronis, also contended to a jailhouse visitor that there were no other police officers among the people he was with that night. [B1.]
 
Shane Daniels, the victim in a beating outside a bar in Westhampton Beach, opened his eyes and began moving his arms and legs. [B3.]
 
The most eloquent words in Westhampton Beach were silent ones. "God bless Shane Daniels" read signs in the windows of a dozen shops and stores. [B3.]
 
Long Trek Through High School
The percentage of New York City high school students graduating on time has reached a five-year low, according to the Board of Education. And as schools encourage students not to drop out, there are more 19-, 20- and 21-year-olds in classrooms. These students, according to a report from the board, have confronted a variety of obstacles to finishing high school in four years. [B1.]
 
From Welfare to a Diploma
Like most people, Kimberli Rothwell has mixed feelings about welfare. She considers it demeaning, and thinks it fosters dependency and is riddled with fraud. She also knows something else about welfare. She knows it made it possible for her to be what she is today: a member of Phi Beta Kappa, winner of a scholarship for her doctoral studies in sociology, graduating with honors from Queens College. An exception, absolutely. But in a society debating the future of public assistance, and in a city where stricter rules are making it more difficult for welfare recipients to go to college, Ms. Rothwell's experience is worth pondering. Metro Matters by Joyce Purnick. [B1.]
 
H & H Bagels Co-Founder Killed
Hector Hernandez was on his way to achieving his American dream when he and his brother-in-law bought a bagel shop on the Upper West Side in 1972. But Mr. Hernandez sold his share in H & H Bagels before it grew into one of the city's best-known bakeries. He had been working as a livery cab driver when he was killed Saturday in what the police called a hit-and-run accident. [B4.]
 
Prosecuting Sex-Abuse Cases
New York State legislative leaders have agreed on a bill that would make it easier to prosecute abusive pedophiles and give their victims more time to bring charges against them. The legislation would eliminate the requirement that children in sex-abuse cases remember exact dates of the alleged attacks. Attorney General Dennis C. Vacco said that that requirement had led to the dismissals of up to 70 percent of child sex-abuse cases. [B6.]
 
CONNECTICUT
 
Landscaping Outrages Town
When Dr. Paul I. Dantzig moved from Utica, N.Y., to Greenwich, Conn., he bought an $825,000 home, had it torn down and began work on another. Then he tore 95 trees down to make room for his vision of flowering magnolias, fruit trees and rhododendrons.Dr. Dantzig now knows he should have stopped with the house. The clear-cutting turned an old New England wood lot into a lunar landscape, shocking his neighbors and horrifying the town. And as word spread of what he had done, so many patients stopped coming to his dermatology office that he had to close his practice. [B1.]
 
NEW JERSEY
 
Turbulence Marks Primaries
As New Jersey voters prepare to go to the polls in a primary election, the most interesting contests in the state are those that have opened up as a result of the race for the seat of the departing Democratic Senator, Bill Bradley. Two Congressmen -- a Democrat, Robert G. Torricelli, and a Republican, Dick Zimmer -- are vying for the seat. All of the state's 13 House seats, in addition to Mr. Bradley's Senate seat, are up for election. But the most contentious primary contests are in the two districts being vacated by Mr. Torricelli and Mr. Zimmer. [B5.]

HEADLINE: RAID AND RELEASE -- A special report.;
A Tattered Crackdown on Illegal Workers

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER 

 BODY:
Walkie-talkies in hand, Federal immigration agents guard possible lines of escape from the garment factories while another contingent spreads through the rows of sewing machines, handcuffing workers believed to be in the country illegally and leading them to government vans.
The raids have inspired a stream of press releases heralding the number of factories hit (86) and workers caught (1,228), a running body count in the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service's newly declared war on illegal employment in New York City's garment industry. The crackdown is a test case of a new strategy the agency hopes to use nationally. 
 But the press releases do not describe what immigration officials, economists and workers themselves say happens after the raids. Most of the workers are released the same day and are usually not deported. Some go back to the very factories where they were picked up. Many move to other factories and sweatshops, or to industries in which there is no crackdown.
The immigration agents generally do not return to the sewing rooms to see if owners have replaced arrested workers with legal hires until after employers have paid their fines, which can take more than a year.
Immigration officials say it is too soon to determine whether their eight-month-old strategy for the garment industry is working. "If we work in an industry long enough and impose enough serious fines, we'll get people's attention and that will provide deterrence," said T. Alexander Aleinikoff, executive assistant commissioner at the immigration service. "That's what we're testing, and we'll see after a year of operation."
But many immigration and garment industry experts say that so far the New York City pilot program appears to be an expensive and futile election-year exercise that is having little effect on employment of illegal immigrants.
"What I see them doing it for is the headlines," said Irwin Kahn, a professor of manufacturing, management and marketing at the Fashion Institute of Technology and chairman of the New York State Garment Industry Advisory Committee. "I don't see them doing it to really accomplish anything."
Despite the threat of heavy additional fines, even some of the small number of factory operators unlucky enough to have been raided in a city with more than 6,000 factories do in fact just hire more illegal workers, who willingly toil for low wages, enabling the businesses to compete with foreign companies that often pay less than 50 cents an hour.
"I can't hire all legal people," said Jane Lee, whose factory, Jane Productions at 341 West 38th Street, was raided in December. "Who wants to work in this dirty job? American people? No."
Ms. Lee, who said she sold her business after the raid but still works there as a manager, called over a prized worker, Felipe Garcia, who said he was a Mexican immigrant here illegally who cuts fabric.
Mr. Garcia said that American workers want sick days and health benefits. "For this work there's a lot of competition," he said. "No boss is going to pay."
"Whatever work there is, I'll do it," said Mr. Garcia, who sends part of his wages home to his parents. "They depend on me."
 
Federal Offensive
New Enforcement Of an Old Law
The crackdown on illegal employment in the garment industry is part of a high-profile offensive by the Clinton Administration to enforce the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, which most researchers agree has never been seriously applied. It prohibits employers from knowingly hiring undocumented workers and authorizes fines of up to $2,000 for each illegal hire.
Last month, the Administration announced the expansion of a pilot program in California in which employers volunteer to verify the legal status of job seekers through a computerized data system.
The pilot program in New York's garment industry began in October. The immigration agency's theory is that by using virtually all its enforcement resources on a single industry known to rely heavily on illegal labor it can help dry up jobs that are the magnet for illegal immigrants.
For the pilot program, the immigration service has increased the number of agents in New York to 45 from 17. The agency has $63.5 million in new funds that will pay to more than double the number of agents in the country, to 700, still a small number to police the millions of businesses in the country for illegal workers.
"We will measure success by jobs freed up for American workers, by wages freed up," Mr. Aleinikoff said.
The New York office does not verify that the employers have legalized their work forces until after it collects fines from them. So far, the agency has issued notices of $215,390 in fines on 18 companies and expects to fine dozens more. Typically, less than half the fines are collected, in part because they are negotiated down.
Are legal workers filling the jobs of those who have been arrested? "I don't know," said John J. Byrnes, chief of the employer sanctions unit in the immigration service's New York office. "We can sit around and guess all day."
Most of the raids so far have taken place in the midtown Manhattan garment district. Illegal workers and employers in Chinatown, which has the largest concentration of garment factories, remain untouched. Professor Kahn said the reason is simple: the agents do not speak Chinese.
Mr. Byrnes acknowledged that with only one Chinese-speaking agent, operating in Chinatown is more difficult, though he said it could be done with translators. He and other authorities also said that because of the large stream of legal Chinese immigrants, Chinese garment workers often have proper documents.
Critics of the program say it is driving illegal workers further underground, making them more vulnerable to unscrupulous employers and more willing to accept even lower wages. Paradoxically, they say, that undermines the Administration's own goals by making it even tougher for legitimate businesses to compete.
"It's a gift to the employer," said Muzaffar Chishti, director of the immigration project at the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees, which represents about 40,000 garment workers in the city. "It looks like we're cracking down on them. But we have terrorized the immigrant community. The employer can pay anything he wants. The workers are afraid to complain. They're afraid to be picked up. They're essentially a hostage work force."
And the way the immigration laws are enforced makes illegal workers especially fearful to report substandard wages and dangerous working conditions, experts say. An agreement between the Federal labor and immigration agencies requires labor inspectors to report immigration law violations to the I.N.S., which workers fear could lead to their arrest.
It is for that reason that the New York State Department of Labor does not collaborate with Federal immigration authorities. "We want illegals to complain if they're not paid," said Thomas Glubiak, who heads the Apparel Industry Task Force at the State Labor Department. If they are afraid to come forward, for fear of being deported, employers can pay them even less, he said. "That makes it even tougher for American workers."
Mr. Aleinikoff of the Immigration and Naturalization Service pointed to that issue as a possible area of contention between the Federal labor and immigration agencies. He said the agreement between them may be modified to address that concern. Still, he said, "The immigration service cannot ignore its mandate to remove illegal workers."
Illegal workers looking for jobs in the garment industry now say they are feeling the pinch caused by the immigration service's crackdown. Maria Aguirre, an illegal worker who labored in the sweatshop that produced blouses under a clothing line named for the talk show host Kathie Lee Gifford, said as she stood at a protest last week outside the factory that she has had a hard time finding a decent job since she was laid off.
"All week, I've been looking for work," she said. "Everywhere they ask for papers, papers, papers. Without papers, they pay $3, $2.75 an hour."
 
Unenforceable Law
Arrested Workers Are Soon Back
The rhythmic beat of salsa and the buzz-saw hum of sewing machines drifted into the hallway where 13 arrested workers lined up politely like moviegoers waiting to buy tickets.
The workers who moments before had been making little A-line minidresses with a swirly 60's print, showed no sign of fear. Middle-aged women were neatly attired for the workday, puffy feet stuffed into low-heeled pumps. One stylish, dramatically made up young woman, her long dark hair in a ponytail, smiled reassuringly at an older woman whose hand was cuffed to her own.
"Senores y senoritas, por favor," said an agent, directing the workers to an exit.
The workers, all Spanish-speaking immigrants employed by Monami Fashion at 555 Eighth Avenue in Manhattan, were taken to an immigration office for "processing."
More than 80 percent of all the workers arrested since October are from Mexico or Ecuador. Most of them have been released simply because there is a shortage of detention space. More than 90 percent of illegal immigrants who are ordered deported while not in custody fail to show up to be sent back to their homelands, immigration officials say.
Only in the month of March did the New York office have enough detention space to hold the workers arrested in the garment industry project, Mr. Byrnes said. For the first eight months of the project, only 270 of the 1,083 arrested workers were detained, he said.
Mr. Aleinikoff, in the immigration service's Washington headquarters, said that judges probably would have eventually ordered the workers released on bond.
"Yes, removal of aliens is crucial," he said. "But the penalties on employers have a more important deterrent function."
By day's end, all but one of the 13 Monami workers had been released on their own recognizance, pending a hearing several months hence. The 13th, who had already been ordered deported, was detained.
Employees like the dozen released from Monami Fashion are not supposed to work while their cases are pending. But asked where some of them could be interviewed, immigration officials themselves suggested a reporter return to the factory where they had been apprehended.
Sure enough, the morning after the raid, the young woman in the ponytail was back at her sewing machine under a dangling fluorescent light. Asked why she had been put back to work, a manager at the factory said, "I cannot answer that question."
 
Owners' Alternative
Acting Illegally Or Going Under
Some employers in the garment district said they hire illegal workers, despite the threat of fines, because it is the only way they can make a profit. If they get hit with heavy fines, they say, they will just go out of business.
While those explanations are clearly self-serving, experts say that surviving in New York's garment industry has gotten tougher. Under pressure from overseas competitors, the industry has been in decline for decades, and that slide has accelerated. From 1990 to 1996, the number of apparel manufacturing jobs in factories registered with the state fell 22.5 percent, to 73,300.
"The retailers squeeze the manufacturers, the manufacturers squeeze the contractors and the contractors squeeze the workers," said Emanuel Tobier, a professor of economics and planning at the Wagner School of Public Affairs at New York University.
In Jae Yoo, the manager of a factory on West 38th Street where 20 workers were arrested in February, said garment shops in Indonesia, India or Taiwan could make virtually the same clothes, but that "the worker is cheap there." If a firm like his complains about the low prices manufacturers offer for a job, he said, "They go overseas."
In a spot check of the 15 factories that the immigration service had raided on West 38th Street through April, 5 could not be found at the addresses listed, and were apparently no longer in business, at least not at the original sites.
Two employers said they had become more careful to check workers' documents and that they now try to employ only the legal ones. Chon Song of Sense 21 Fashion at 325 West 38th Street said she sees it as her duty to abide by the law. "I'm not saying I'm perfect, but I'm trying," she said.
Steven Lee has opened a new business in the factory once operated by Spring and Soon Fashion at 262 West 38th Street, which closed after the I.N.S. raid. Mr. Lee, wearing the Ralph Lauren polo shirt that seems to be de rigueur among factory operators, said he is a small businessman caught between immigration laws and larger economic forces.
After working for six years as a manager in a garment factory, he said, he scraped together the money to start his own factory with a partner. "This is the only business I can start with $50,000," he said. "If I want a grocery store, how much do I need? $200,000."
If immigration agents raid his factory, he said, he is finished. "If I have 15 illegals and the fine is $2,000 per person, I'd have to shut my factory."
On the other hand, he said, "I have to make a profit. I don't want to lose money all year round. I have to cut the labor costs down. The manufacturers are cutting the prices down because business is getting worse.
"Let me tell you honestly. I think I have to hire illegal people because I don't want to pay $7, $8 for work that illegal people can do for $4.25. That's honest."

HEADLINE: Advocates of Sustainable Mahogany Harvests Counter Boycott

BYLINE: By LES LINE 

 BODY:
THE mahogany tree, with its dark and beautifully grained wood, has become a lightning rod for environmental activists committed to saving the tropical forests of Latin America. The Rainforest Action Network, based in San Francisco, says the bigleaf mahogany, which grows from southern Mexico to Brazil, is in danger of extinction, and it has called for a boycott of mahogany products by American consumers and international action to restrict the mahogany trade.
But finding new ways to grow and harvest mahogany under natural conditions may be the best means of saving both the tree and the rain forest, say researchers at the Manomet Observatory for Conservation Sciences in Manomet, Mass. In cooperation with the Belize Forest Department and the nonprofit Program for Belize, they have begun experiments aimed at creating profits for native loggers while protecting forest biodiversity. One project uses intensive thinning to simulate the sunlit forest openings that are caused naturally by hurricanes, floods and fires because mahogany needs such clearings to reseed. 
 "A boycott is a bad idea," said Dr. Nick Brokaw, a tropical forest ecologist at the observatory. "We should be buying tropical timber so that it remains valuable. If there's no market for the wood, the forests will be mowed down and the land turned to agriculture."
Dr. Brokaw said Belize was the perfect place to create an ecology-based tropical-forest industry. Despite widespread clearing for plantation crops like sugar and citrus, about 55 percent of Belize, a small Central American country with 8,800 square miles, is still covered with natural tropical forest, and nearly half of that is reserved for conservation and sustainable forestry. He also noted that Belize had impressive populations of big animals that are threatened or have been eradicated elsewhere in the region, including the jaguar and tapir.
But the long-term survival of Belize's forests and wildlife is in jeopardy, the ecologist warned, because logging has depleted the most valuable tree, mahogany, and markets for more abundant "secondary species" are poorly developed. While Belize's economy once depended on logging, forest products now account for only 3 percent of the gross domestic product, and thousands of acres of forest reserve lands have already been converted to agriculture.
"Biologists and foresters must work together to restore a strong economic incentive for conserving the forest," Dr. Brokaw said.
Manomet Observatory's Belize experiments, he said, could have important implications throughout Central America. Forests in the Peten region of northern Guatemala are still rich in mahogany, and a tract of 2.5 million acres has been set aside in a nature reserve, Dr. Brokaw said, but new ideas about how to harvest the forests in a sustainable way are needed to prevent deforestation.
Bigleaf or Honduran mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla) is the quintessential tropical rain forest tree. In undisturbed primary forests, it grows to a height of 130 feet, with a buttressed trunk and a crown that spreads over the canopy of lesser trees. International trade in mahogany for shipbuilding, fine furniture, cabinetmaking, musical instruments, coffins and other uses has been intense since the 1500's, and the supply of another type called West Indian mahogany, found on Caribbean islands, was exhausted early in this century. Trees of marketable size are now scarce or inaccessible in Central America, and the vast forests of Brazil and Bolivia are the source of much of today's mahogany lumber.
The Rainforest Action Network estimates that mahogany is being logged at an annual rate of nearly 140,000 trees; an average tree is said to be worth about $1,500 wholesale when the wood is exported to the United States. The network contends that most of the mahogany on the world market is logged illegally by "outlaw timber companies" that invade parks, conservation reserves or indigenous areas, causing irreparable damage to the ecosystem with logging roads.
Temperate North American forests are dominated by two or three kinds of trees, but mahogany occurs only sporadically in tropical forests. A two-and-a-half-acre stand of Belize forest will have 45 to 60 tree species but only one or two marketable mahogany trees, Dr. Brokaw said.
Selective cutting of legal-size trees, leaving the forest canopy intact, might seem to be the best way to preserve both mahogany and biodiversity, he said, under the assumption that the mahogany would be naturally replenished.
But mahogany seedlings need light to grow, and selective cutting leaves only small holes in the canopy. Moreover, most of the large seed-producing trees are removed, Dr. Brokaw said.
Manomet scientists point out that mahogany is a successional species adapted to exploit the natural disasters that remove the trees competing with it for sunlight. At the Rio Bravo Conservation and Management Area in northern Belize, they are using a variety of tactics, including patch and strip cuts downwind of fruiting mahoganies, to create disturbances big enough to grow marketable trees without degrading the environment. Populations of birds and butterflies, both sensitive to forest disturbances, will be monitored to determine if the clearings adversely affect native and migratory wildlife.
Rio Bravo is a 228,000-acre reserve acquired through the efforts of the Massachusetts Audubon Society and managed by the Program for Belize. The forest has not been clear-cut since the time of the ancient Maya, Dr. Brokaw said, but most of the mahogany was removed by the tract's former owner, a British timber company. The only significant new mahogany growth is along major roads, where the canopy is open.
"We're saying that if Rio Bravo is to support active forestry," Dr. Brokaw said, "we have to intervene to disturb the forest more than would occur naturally or with selective logging. We can't just wait around for a hurricane." Under good conditions, a mahogany tree needs 40 years or more to grow to harvestable size, he said. "But in three to five years, we should know enough about the ecology of mahogany to make confident management suggestions."
But Dr. Frank H. Wadsworth, a research forester at the International Institute of Tropical Forestry in Puerto Rico, is skeptical about the Manomet experiment. The future for mahogany is in plantations, he said. "We're growing mahogany to maturity and larger on plantations in Puerto Rico," Dr. Wadsworth said. "Indonesia has 300,000 acres of mahogany plantations. My answer is to go into secondary forest land and underplant mahogany in rows or use abandoned agricultural lands. We don't have to barge into the old growth."

HEADLINE: Russia's Election: Expect the Extremes

BYLINE: By Stephen Sestanovich; Stephen Sestanovich is vice president for Russian and Eurasian affairs at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Is Boris Yeltsin a democrat or an autocrat? Do Russia's Communists intend to re-Stalinize the country, or have they learned their lesson?
Ask many experts what the presidential election on June 16 is likely to produce, and one hears a lot about continuity: Whatever their deepest desires, it seems the Communists, if victorious, will be held in check by the economic transformation that has already taken place. They know that they can't turn back the clock without bloodshed. As for Mr. Yeltsin, whatever promises he makes now, his re-election will only bring the final petering out of reform, along with cronyism and corruption on a vast scale. 
 These predictions treat inertia as the most powerful force shaping Russia's future. Yet the past decade -- the past century, for that matter -- should make us wary of such forecasts. Russia is in flux, politically, economically, socially, culturally. No matter how the voters choose, they may get something quite different, either much better or much worse than what we see today.
Start with a Communist victory. In the short run, the main reason to think that it could produce real turmoil is, paradoxically, the very reason the experts invoke as their best hope for stability: the strength of the market. Yes, many Russians now own property, and this is a barrier of sorts to the quick restoration of a command economy. But the standoff between a Communist government and Russia's new capitalist class would be precarious at best and under certain circumstances completely unmanageable.
Consider how easily the value of Russia's currency could be destroyed. Over the past year, the ruble has held steady at around 5,000 to the dollar. This has been a substantial achievement of Government policy, but it could quickly evaporate if people with money conclude that a Communist victory will put in doubt the future value of their rubles.
As it happens, the Government has kept the ruble so strong that some sort of slide is probably inevitable, no matter who wins. A Communist victory could turn this slide into an avalanche, with extreme implications. If the ruble suddenly drops in value to, say, 20,000 to the dollar, the Central Bank is not likely to be either willing or able to prop it up. Once the national currency has become worthless, the real issue will be the largest one of all: how to run the economy. Soon enough, and far sooner than any of its members ever expected, a restored Communist government will be fixing prices, wages, interest rates -- everything.
For many party members, such control will seem merely the natural order of things, but it will not produce the stability they claim to remember from the past. Instead, the old black market will revive; corruption, protection rackets and extortion will be still more widespread; enterprises and industries that won't cooperate with the new order or can't survive the upheaval will be renationalized.
Turmoil in Russia will also do important damage to other former Soviet states, like Ukraine, whose economies are still joined at the hip with their large neighbor. (So much for the cheerful view that the worst the Communists can do is weaken Russia itself.)
After almost five years of effort, the Russian Government is only now stabilizing the economy. Against this background, to expect continuity if the Communists regain power is to ignore one of the main ways in which markets can destabilize governments -- by panicking. When a half-reformed Russian economy meets a less than half-reformed Communist Party, there will be many reasons to panic.
As for those who say nothing will change in the event of a Yeltsin victory, they discount the most important source of dynamism now operating in Russian politics -- the electoral process itself. They treat all the most dispiriting features of the current regime as permanent: the behind-the-scenes influence of the President's buddies at the expense of serious and capable officials; the dangerous autonomy of the military, police and K.G.B.; the fact that constructive policy so often sinks in a sea of intrigue, special favors and incompetence.
Until the election campaign began, it was hard to refute the claim that this was the true and final form of Mr. Yeltsin's rule. Yet the campaign itself has made the balance of power inside the Government look far more fluid. Real reformers have gained influence; those whose main skill is barking orders in the Kremlin are on the defensive.
The first hint of this reversal has been the return to favor of Anatoly Chubais, once the capable overseer of all economic reform policy. After the Communists did well in last December's parliamentary elections, Mr. Yeltsin made Mr. Chubais the fall guy and publicly vilified him. Now he has brought him back as a pivotal figure in the campaign. (Meanwhile, the man who embodies the new cronyism -- the head of the presidential guard, Gen. Aleksandr Korzhakov -- has been openly repudiated by his boss for proposing to cancel the election.)
Even more revealing has been the public (though still hesitant) negotiations between Mr. Yeltsin and Grigory Yavlinsky, his most formidable democratic rival. At the beginning of the year, both men were widely expected to lean far to the left in competing for Communist votes. Instead, each has adopted anti-Communist rhetoric and acknowledged the logic of an alliance between them.
A united front has not materialized and probably cannot be consummated until after the first round of voting. But Mr. Yeltsin's eagerness for Mr. Yavlinsky's support shows the impact of electoral competition. To win, the President needs precisely those voters who won't back the Communists but have to be reassured that they are choosing something better than the tawdry status quo.
These stirrings are giving life to what seemed, at the outset of the campaign, the least likely of all possible results: the revival of reform. Not since Mr. Yeltsin won a national referendum in April 1993 has a Russian election produced a reformist victory. Two subsequent parliamentary elections, in December 1993 and December 1995, taught the President that his reformers were a political liability. And each time he responded by dismissing the most prominent among them.
The current campaign may teach Boris Yeltsin a different lesson. His return from the dead -- the near-certainty that he will now make it into the runoff -- has been achieved almost entirely through the support of pro-reform voters. If, between rounds, he is propelled further by an alliance with Mr. Yavlinsky and wins, Russian politics will be different.
Society will be no less divided, Parliament will be no less Communist, the state bureaucracy will be no less corrupt and enfeebled. But political momentum may, even if only briefly, be on the side of those with a progressive vision of their country's future. They are already maneuvering to make sure that they can use it.
Americans should not be mesmerized by either of the possibilities sketched here. But we should see that they are possibilities. And because they are, it is not enough to be prepared only for continuity. The Clinton Administration favors Mr. Yeltsin but says it will do business with whoever is elected, a position that will look foolishly complacent if things go badly. By contrast, those who insist that Mr. Yeltsin is little better than the Communists will find it harder to see, or support, a reformist opening if it materializes.
It always seems safe to bet on continuity, until things change. For anyone who is sure they won't, Russia's election may be storing up surprises.

HEADLINE: Herman Starobin, 75, Ex-Aide Of Garment Workers' Union

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS 

 BODY:
Herman Starobin, a former research director of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union and a critic of free-trade policies, died on Saturday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. He was 75 and lived in Great Neck, L.I.
The cause was heart disease, his wife, Carol Fijan Starobin, said. 
 After a career as a corporate economist and a manufacturing executive, Mr. Starobin became research director of the union in 1984. He became an expert on international trade and advised Congress and the United States trade representative.
Speaking out against free-trade policies, which he contended had led to the loss of many jobs in the garment industry, Mr. Starobin wrote in an article on imports and the garment industry in 1985: "We have a third world in this country. We are sacrificing that third world for some esoteric ideology of free trade that bears no relationship to reality."
He worked for the I.L.G.W.U., which recently merged with the Amalgamated Textile Workers Union to form the Union of Needle Trades Industrial and Textile Employees, or Unite, until a month ago.
Mr. Starobin grew up in New York and became involved in left-wing politics when he was a student at City College. After graduating, he spent several years as a freelance correspondent in Europe in World War II. When Mr. Starobin returned in 1946, he took over his father's business, manufacturing steel doors. He also studied economics at New York University, from which he received a doctorate.
He joined Harman Industries, a maker of high-fidelity equipment, in 1969 as corporate economist and became its president. He left in 1984 after Beatrice Industries bought the company.
In addition to his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Christina Starobin of Manhattan.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Rebounds as Traders See More Economic Strength

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar rose yesterday against the German mark and the Japanese yen as traders expected strong American economic data and dismissed warnings by a prominent economist of a financial crisis in Brazil like the one that struck Mexico a year and a half ago.
After reaching a three-week low against the mark and easing against the yen early yesterday, the dollar rose above its levels of late Friday after traders bought the dollar, speculating that a strong report on Friday about employment in the United States might prompt American interest rates to rise. 
 "If rates in the U.S. continue to move higher this week in anticipation of a strong number," said Seth Cohen, director of foreign-exchange sales at Merrill Lynch, "that generally will have a positive impact" on the dollar.
The dollar rose to 1.5279 marks yesterday from 1.5233 on Friday and to 108.37 yen from 108.05.
Mr. Cohen said that the dollar would tend to rise against the mark if American interest rates continued to increase relative to those in Germany. Investors seeking greater returns would need dollars to buy higher-yielding United States securities.
Also yesterday, Rudiger Dornbusch, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a former adviser to President Clinton on Latin American debt, suggested that the current international investment climate in Brazil was unstable.
His remarks, which were reported in The Wall Street Journal, briefly eroded interest in buying the dollar as traders recalled the Mexican investment crisis, which roiled markets in late 1994 and early 1995, affecting the dollar, in particular.
But as the market pondered Mr. Dornbusch's remarks, the parallels with Mexico seemed more remote and traders became more comfortable about taking back dollars they had sold earlier.
"If something did blow up in Brazil, the direct effect on the U.S. would be much less than we saw in Mexico," said Win Thin, an international economist at HSBC Midland Bank. "I don't think it would be the same sort of negative for us as people saw with the peso."
The dollar also got a slight lift when the yen sagged on news of the failure of a Japanese financing company.
The bankruptcy filing yesterday by the company, Shinkyoto Shinpan, raised speculation that the Bank of Japan would be unlikely to raise interest rates while Japan's banking sector was still struggling under bad loans from the 1980's.

HEADLINE: PRIVATE HOSPITALS IN NEW YORK SIGNAL A DEEPENING CRISIS

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
At least a dozen of New York City's private hospitals are planning large-scale layoffs next month or are late in paying significant bills, concrete signals that the long-predicted financial crisis for the region's private hospitals has finally arrived.
Squeezed by sharp Medicaid cuts and the rise of health maintenance organizations, a handful of private hospitals this month notified the city's principal hospital workers union that they intend to lay off 517 union members July 1, a huge increase from the usual rate of 50 a month. And many other hospital workers will lose their jobs as well. St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan will eliminate hundreds of positions from its work force on July 1, including 160 from the hospital workers union, 34 registered nurses and more than 100 supervisory jobs. 
 At the same time, some hospitals, mostly those in poor neighborhoods, have fallen hundreds of thousands of dollars behind in paying bills for services like business consulting and health insurance for their employees. Interfaith Medical Center in central Brooklyn owes $11 million to the union fund that provides pensions and health insurance for its workers, a bill so large that paying it could force the hospital into bankruptcy. Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center and Brookdale Hospital Medical Center in Brooklyn also owe millions.
"Hospitals will close," said Dennis Rivera, president of Local 1199 of the National Health and Human Service Employees Union, with 117,000 members. "It is happening in front of our eyes." Mr. Rivera called the number of planned layoffs and delinquencies on payments "just extraordinary," adding: "Not a day goes by without a call saying, 'How about we don't pay workers for two weeks?' Or, 'Don't cash that check for the next three hours.' I never got calls like that before."
Kenneth E. Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, an industry group, called the layoffs and the piles of unpaid bills "early warning signs" of hospitals in jeopardy and agreed that some of the city's 80 private hospitals could close in a matter of months.
But Dr. Barbara A. DeBuono, the New York State Commissioner of Health, said that most if not all of the hospitals sending out distress signals would survive, either by allying with stronger hospitals or reinventing themselves as other types of medical centers, such as outpatient clinics.
"I don't think any hospital is likely to close soon," Dr. DeBuono said. "In other states there have been lots of mergers and conversions and I think that will happen here."
Virtually everyone, including the hospital trade association, agrees that there are more hospital beds than are needed in the metropolitan area, and that drives up costs. But while some health economists predict increased efficiency as a result of consolidation, others worry that if the market is allowed to decide which hospitals survive, some poor neighborhoods will be left without either hospital care or outpatient care, since the clinics where patients go for routine doctor visits are often located within hospital buildings in the inner city
Dr. DeBuono said the state would monitor the fate of troubled hospitals to make sure that people in poor areas of the city continued to have access to primary care, hospitalization and emergency rooms.
 
Fewer Beds By a Third
Hospitals in the state, both public and private, are suffering for a variety of reasons, including two years of $100 million in Medicaid cuts and the rapid growth of health maintenance organizations, which demand deep discounts for care. Public hospitals in New York City have recently announced 1,800 union layoffs for next month.
Earlier this year two studies predicted that the state would lose a third of its 37,000 hospital beds in the next four years, with up to a dozen private hospitals closing. Now, the state, which has for years swept in to rescue troubled hospitals, plans to deregulate the industry on July 1, allowing market forces to have far greater sway in their rates and fates.
"Everyone always cries wolf, but the pressures are of a different magnitude now," said William Bernstein, a partner in Kalkines Arky Zall & Bernstein, a law firm with a large health care practice. "In the past everyone wanted to preserve the viability of hospitals, but that is no longer the operating assumption of the market or the government."
While it is difficult to measure exactly how budget and staffing cuts affect patients, health experts say that at some point the quality of services if not medical care itself must fall. Rooms might be dirtier, meals served cold and attendants harder to summon.
In a number of other cities, private hospitals in poor neighborhoods have succumbed to the combined pressure of government cuts and the rise of managed care. In Chicago, for example, more than a dozen hospitals have closed in the last five years, and some are now skeletons, empty buildings with locked doors.
Shock waves from failures in New York are certain to reach Capitol Hill. Sixty-four hospitals in New York have a combined $4.5 billion worth of mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration, a branch of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. If a hospital goes into default, taxpayers will be left with the bill.
"We are very concerned about what is going on in New York and we are monitoring the situation very closely," said John U. Sepulveda, director of the hospital mortgage insurance program at the Federal Housing Administration. A recent General Accounting Office report said that the stability of the housing administration's hospital program is at risk because more than 80 percent of its hospital business is in New York.
 
Steps To Failure
Failing hospitals go through a fairly predictable series of steps, health economists say: First they lag in paying bills; second they have buyouts and layoffs; then they miss or are late with a payroll, or drop a service -- like kidney dialysis -- that is a money loser. Mortgage payments and taxes are the last to go.
Many of the city's troubled private hospitals are, like Interfaith, old hospitals in poor neighborhoods that have been racked by Medicaid cuts. But other troubled medical centers, like St. Luke's-Roosevelt, have modern buildings in well-to-do neighborhoods. St-Luke's-Roosevelt was slow to prepare for the world of managed care and is carrying a $400 million mortgage insured by the Federal Housing Administration.
Many hospitals have notified the hospital workers union that they intend to lay off members as of July 1. Those who are to lose jobs include 36 staff members at Brookdale Hospital Medical Center, 182 at Flushing Hospital Medical Center and 160 at St. Luke's-Roosevelt. The workers include housekeepers, nursing attendants, receptionists and deliverers of food trays.
St. Luke's-Roosevelt plans to eliminate 500 jobs, including nonunion workers, from its staff of 6,000, according to Mr. Rivera, who is notified of all layoffs planned by a hospital if union members are involved. In the last three years, the hospital has cut more than half its beds, to 600 from 1,300.
"The sense around here is very bleak," said one employee who spoke on condition of anonymity. "People wouldn't be surprised if they showed up and there was a padlock on the door." The hospital declined to comment.
A survey by the Greater New York Hospital Association found that private hospitals eliminated well over 4,000 jobs last year through layoffs, buyouts and attrition.
"We believe that is considerably more than in the previous year," said Barbara Green, whose office conducted the study, which was performed for the first time in 1995.
 
Paychecks, So Far, Still Arriving
Although no hospital has reported missing a payroll, some have come close. Mr. Rivera said that two months ago the management at Bronx-Lebanon, a crucial health care provider to the poor neighborhoods of the South Bronx, asked to delay a paycheck by two weeks, a request Mr. Rivera denied.
Union officials also listed 11 hospitals and nursing homes that were late in payments to cover their employees' health benefits and pensions, in one case threatening workers' health coverage.
"Delinquencies have increased dramatically," said Eleanor Tilson, director of Local 1199's health and pension fund, "and that is an indication of hospitals running out of cash."
Interfaith Medical Center owes more than $11 million to the fund, Mr. Rivera said, and has not made a payment in over a year. A court decision gave the benefits fund the right to claim money from the hospital Medicaid check, although it has not done so yet.
"We are Interfaith's largest creditor, and if we call those debts they won't meet payroll and we'd force them to close," said Mr. Rivera, describing the union's bind.
Interfaith, which routinely lost over $20 million a year in the early 1990's, has been under new management since 1993 and now more or less breaks even. It has courted managed-care contracts, streamlined billing and improved primary care. But it is more than 70 years old, in need of renovation and also feeling the legacy of its deep losses.
"Our old losses translate into cash-flow issues," said Corbett Price, the chief executive officer of Interfaith, who spent 15 years as an executive in a for-profit hospital chain. "But I believe with rebuilding we will be in good position to compete." Interfaith has been waiting to renovate for several years, but the state has not approved the necessary financing.
Mr. Rivera said that a number of other hospitals are delinquent. Bronx-Lebanon owes $2.5 million and is three months overdue. Brookdale owes $1 million and is also three months overdue. Mount Vernon Hospital owes more than $1 million and is behind by a year. St. Luke's-Roosevelt was $1 million behind in its payment last week, but has since caught up.
"One of the first warning signs you have that a hospital is in trouble is that payments are stretched out -- for medical supplies, for food, for fuel, for utilities," Mr. Raske, the hospital association president, said. "That phase lasts until the vendors start playing hardball and threaten to turn the lights off."
Mr. Raske said that in the last year he had had to intervene when a utility threatened to shut off service to a member hospital for nonpayment of bills, and that in the last six months, there had been a markedincrease in the number of hospitals failing to pay the association for services it sells, like bill collection and consulting advice.
While some of the troubled hospitals may be able to reorganize so that they can compete for managed-care business, health experts say that others will never survive without state investment and intervention, particularly those that need rebuilding.
Health care experts and Federal officials said that if the state allowed hospitals to fail, particularly those with large Government-insured mortgages, the Federal Housing Administration would be far more reluctant to back mortgages in the state, making it difficult for many of the city's hospitals to borrow money.
Dr. DeBuono noted that Gov. George E. Pataki had allocated $52 million to help hospitals make the transition into the free market. But she said the state would no longer routinely "shepherd hospitals through difficult times."
"We want to help, but I don't think that the future is necessarily building -- in new bricks and mortar," she said. "For some hospitals it may be seeking new partners, or converting to a new purpose. That may be their way out."

HEADLINE: Study Rethinks Relationship Between Welfare and Work

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 3

 BODY:
As state and Federal lawmakers seek to overhaul welfare and move more people into jobs, a respected child advocacy organization reported today that the number of children living in poverty while their parents work has sharply increased over the last generation.
The report, released today by the Annie E. Casey Foundation, said the number of children of the working poor rose to 5.6 million in 1994 from 3.4 million two decades ago, a 65 percent increase. 
 Drawing on census data, the Baltimore-based foundation said children of the working poor were the fastest-growing segment of the country's population of children living in poverty. In contrast, the number of children supported by Aid to Families with Dependent Children, the country's main welfare program, increased by 25 percent in the same period, to 9.6 million from 7.8 million, according to the Department of Health and Human Services.
The foundation said its research also called into question some traditional perceptions of the children of the working poor. It notes that in 1994, the most recent year for which data were available, 14 percent of the children were born to teen-age mothers and that half lived with two married parents, one of whom -- generally the father -- worked.
The foundation's report comes as debates are taking place in Washington and state capitals about overhauling welfare and requiring recipients to take jobs, often low-skilled positions paying the minimum wage. As they pare the welfare caseload, lawmakers should be careful not to make the plight of the poor worse, foundation officials said.
"If we are not careful doing the right thing, moving families from welfare to work may do as much to compound the numbers and problems of children in working poor families as it does to solve them," said Douglas Nelson, executive director of the Casey Foundation.
For the purposes of the study, the researchers defined a working poor family as a family of three where at least one parent worked at least 50 weeks out of the year and whose income in 1994 was less than $11,821.
The report's authors said children of the working poor were prone to the same types of problems that plague children growing up on welfare: higher rates of juvenile delinquency and teen-age pregnancy, higher school dropout rates and less likelihood of attending college. But they also said there had not been much research comparing the problems of the children of the working poor with children on welfare.
Officials at the foundation say that in some respects, children of people on welfare have certain benefits, like health insurance, unavailable to those children whose parents work but remain poor.
Today's report by the Casey Foundation bolsters a growing body of research by social scientists and economists on the stagnation or decline in real incomes, especially among people with few skills and little education.
"If you look at men with less than a high school degree and you compare 1979 to 1993, you have a 22 percent decline in their income," said Rebecca Blank, an economics professor at Northwestern University. "That's a quarter of their income."
But Casey Foundation officials and others note that when it comes to poverty issues, much of the debate has been about moving people off of welfare, and there has been little attention paid to what might happen to them after they leave the dole.
"I don't want to minimize the issues that get a lot of attention -- teen-age pregnancy and the problems of the inner city," said Sheldon Danziger, a professor of social work and public policy at the University of Michigan. "But they tend to neglect the large number of working poor."
And the foundation's officials and others note that while welfare rolls have shown cyclical tendencies -- rising during tough economic times and falling during recoveries -- the growth in the number of working poor appears more chronic.
"The problem of being a working poor parent seems to be a more durable problem today," Mr. Nelson said. "People are earning less and there is less likelihood of them being able to climb out of their situation."
Like a number of other researchers, the Casey Foundation officials blame the growth of the working poor in part on the globalization of markets and advances in technology that do not reward the poorly educated and the unskilled.

HEADLINE: F.T.C. Issues Guidelines for Mergers

BYLINE: By BARRY MEIER 

 BODY:
The Federal Trade Commission proposed yesterday that antitrust regulators considering a merger give greater weight to cost savings and other efficiencies gained both by companies and consumers.
But in the same long-awaited report, the F.T.C. also indicated that it would more closely scrutinize how a proposed merger might affect product innovation and competitiveness in high-tech fields like biotechnology and computers. 
 The report drew upon two months of public hearings last fall that explored the role of the trade commission in an economy increasingly marked by global competition. The report's suggested changes in agency guidelines were largely anticipated by antitrust lawyers and in, most cases, represented an effort to codify current agency practices rather than overhaul its mission.
The commission chairman, Robert Pitofsky, said the agency already took cost savings into account in analyzing a merger requiring Federal approval. But he also said that by developing guidelines on the issue some mergers currently opposed by agency staff might be approved.
"We thought it was time to take a more generous view of the efficiencies that a merger might yield in areas like reductions in unit and production costs," Mr. Pitofsky said.
Companies seeking Federal approval of mergers have often argued that combining their operations would be more efficient. But that argument has often failed legally because a decades-old Supreme Court decision expressed skepticism about that argument.
James Loftis, an antitrust lawyer in Washington, said the effect of the proposed change could be important. "This could prove to be significant for manufacturing industries and have broad implications for other companies as well," he said.
But Kevin Arquit, an antitrust lawyer in New York, said the main effect of any change would be to insure consistency in decisions by F.T.C. regulators. "This is going to mean that more staff decisions are realistic and even-handed," he said.
Mr. Pitofsky said there were several practical questions to be resolved by guideline changes, including how to determine whether cost savings claimed by industry would be passed on to consumers. The report proposes that the F.T.C. and the Justice Department, which also has antitrust oversight, establish a joint task force to consider the issue.
In an era marked by fast-moving technological change, the F.T.C. report also proposed giving greater scrutiny to the effect a proposed merger would have on product innovation and competition, a procedure that it is already beginning to follow. Such a review would include not only the competitive impact of products that two companies may already have on the market but also those products in the research-and-development phase.
Mr. Pitofsky said the proposal meant that in merger reviews the agency would take a closer look at such issues as patents, cross-licensing agreements and research-and-development joint ventures. "If we wait until the research reaches the product stage, we may have missed the boat," he said.
In its report, the F.T.C. said it had decided not to broaden the guidelines under which it would approve mergers involving a distressed company. Mr. Pitosky, however, said that such companies might be able to improve their chances for obtaining merger approval by being able to argue successfully that a deal would provide cost saving both for itself and the public.
"The failing firms that you really care about are those that through combinations can increase their likelihood for success," Mr. Pitofsky said.

Belle Straddles Line Of Intimidation Tactics

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
With an unintended touch of irony, the commissioner's office (the one without a commissioner to fill it) released yesterday the first results of the fan voting for next month's All-Star Game, showing Ken Griffey Jr. well ahead of all American League players. Seattle's Griffey gets the votes; Cleveland's Albert Belle gets suspended.
The All-Star vote is simply another validation of Griffey's popularity. The suspension is another validation of Belle's villainy. 
 Most hitters of Belle's ability, like Griffey, attract attention with their batting exploits. Belle was third in total All-Star votes, but his escapades often overshadow his hitting exploits and make people forget what a good hitter he is.
Now comes Albert the base runner. Yesterday he had baseball people and fans alike debating the propriety of a play last Friday night in which he hit Fernando Vina, the Milwaukee Brewers' second baseman, with a vicious forearm as Vina tagged him between first and second. The verdict among a small group of former players, all intimidating base runners in their time, was split.
Frank Robinson, currently unemployed after a lengthy front-office tenure with Baltimore, was credited in his playing days with being the man who, when the Cincinnati Reds traded him to the Orioles 30 years ago, introduced the National League style of hard, aggressive base running to the American League.
"What you have to look at is what Albert Belle intended," Robinson said by telephone from Los Angeles. "My thinking is, he didn't go in there to hurt Vina or to hit him with a forearm in the face. Here's a big man going into a little man. He wanted to hit him in the chest area and knock him down or back to keep him from making the double play. His forearm came up and hit him in the face. I don't think that was his intention. I think people are looking at it harshly."
When he played, Robinson said, if the fielder fielded the ball in the baseline, he was "fair game."
"You didn't go in to hurt him," he said, "but you do what you have to do to prevent the double play."
Joe Brinkman, the chief of the umpiring crew that worked Friday night's game, said Belle's play was legal. But can a play be both legal and improper at the same time?
Don Baylor, the Colorado Rockies' manager, who was another of that band of players who sacrificed their bodies on the bases, suggested an answer of yes.
"That's where you draw the line," Baylor said of the forearm. "It's a cheap shot. A forearm is not part of it. If he had run over him, knocked him down, no one would have said a thing. A forearm is different."
Belle was at first base because he had been hit with a pitch. "When I got hit with pitches," Baylor said by telephone from Pittsburgh, "I'm thinking, 'Now I have to get a middle infielder.' But I didn't think about hitting a guy in the throat with a forearm, just sliding hard."
Baylor offered a test to determine Belle's intent on the play and the reaction it should have provoked.
"It depends on who the person is," he said. "If he was an aggressive slider into second base breaking up double plays, Frank Robinson or Curt Blefary or Hal McRae or myself, it probably would be no big deal. But he is not a guy known to break up any double plays. Albert Belle does not have the reputation for running down there and sliding into guys. If he did, he wouldn't be criticized for some of the most routine things."
Belle, Baylor noted, had an opportunity to break up a double play earlier in the same game in the very same circumstance and didn't run into Vina.
"The mistake he made is he didn't do it the first time," Baylor said. "Any time I slid into a guy hard to break up a double play, I did it in the first or second inning, so when you come back the second time he's going to get out of there."
McRae, a coach with the Reds and as intimidating a base runner as baseball has had in the past 25 years, was reluctant to criticize Belle.
"In Belle's case, his job is to attempt to spin the second baseman around so he can't throw to first," McRae said from Cincinnati. "That can be very aggressive. But he sort of gave him a forearm shiver."
Pressed for an opinion on the forearm shiver as an acceptable technique, McRae said: "I don't want to be critical in that respect, but I thought he was maybe overly aggressive. I think the play was legal, but yes, you can go too far."
McRae will be remembered as the base runner who threw a cross-body block on Willie Randolph in the second game of the 1977 A.L. Championship Series between the Yankees and the Kansas City Royals. He not only broke up the double play, but also kept Randolph pinned to the ground long enough for Fred Patek to score from second. "At the time it was legal," McRae said of the block.
Marty Springstead was the second-base umpire in that game. "The rule was changed as a result of that play," said Springstead, now the A.L. executive director of umpiring.

An unusual security helps people like Eli Broad cash out.

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris 

 BODY:
LI BROAD has become rich twice by anticipating the needs of the Baby Boomers and trying to meet them. Now he is moving to cash in a substantial part of his profits, on terms that could give him about $194 million tax free.
The securities being sold this week on behalf of Mr. Broad, the chairman of SunAmerica Inc., are part of a trend on Wall Street that uses an unusual type of security to get cash. Just as if he had sold the 3.45 million shares of SunAmerica underlying the transaction, Mr. Broad will get the cash now and will not suffer if the market value of the shares falls later. 
 But he will not have to pay capital gains taxes for years, if at all. And if the underlying stock soars, he will get part of the profits. In return, he agrees to pay a low rate of interest on the money for the next three years. The shares being put up represent about a third of his stake, including shares he has the right to purchase with options.
The securities, being underwritten by Merrill Lynch, give investors less upside potential than if they simply bought the stock. But they also get, for a few years, a modest stream of income that is not available to stockholders.
They should also realize that their gain, if any, comes at the expense of a man who knows far more about the company than they ever will.
Mr. Broad is a founder of Kaufman & Broad, a home builder that became rich filling the housing needs of the Baby Boom and then spun off Sun America, an insurance company that has specialized in selling annuities to Baby Boomers investing for retirement. SunAmerica has been a phenomenal stock market success. A $1,000 investment in the stock in late 1990 would now be worth more than $25,000, and that does not include substantial dividends that have been paid. Wall Street analysts generally like the stock.
The exact terms of the new security will be announced in the next few days, but it appears that they will be something like the following. Each security will cost the same as the current price of a share of SunAmerica stock, which closed yesterday at $56.50. They will pay interest of about 6.75 percent for three years.
At the end of the period, or possibly earlier, the holder will get a payoff that varies with the price of SunAmerica stock. If the stock falls, or rises less than 35 percent, they will be paid back with one share of SunAmerica stock, or with the same value in cash. Should SunAmerica rise more than 35 percent, the payoff would be capped at 35 percent, or $76.11 if the issuing price is the same as yesterday's closing stock price.
During that three-year period, Mr. Broad will continue to own the stock, collect dividends on it and vote the shares at annual meetings. But he will not suffer if it falls. And under the tax laws, he will not have to pay capital gains taxes until he delivers the shares. If he delivers cash instead, he will not have to pay capital gains taxes even then.
Although details differ, a number of other shareholders have issued similar securities or are planning to do so.
Sam Zell, the Chicago investor, disclosed plans last week to issue similar securities to monetize a stake in IMC Global held by a company he controls. Mr. Zell's company got the stake when a company in which it had a large stake was acquired earlier this year by IMC Global, which makes plant nutrients. Merrill Lynch is also handling that deal.
Those securities would have a five-year life -- delaying the need to pay capital gains taxes at least that long -- and would pay an interest rate not yet specified, but perhaps about 6 percent. In this case, however, the buyer would get the first 20 percent of the upside in the stock and share the rest, if there is any. The downside, if any, will go strictly to the buyer. The plan is to monetize 6.5 million shares worth about $237 million.
A similar deal was done last month for U S West, which monetized its holdings in Financial Security Assurance, a bond insurer, through a Salomon Brothers issue.
The securities, which are traded on the New York Stock Exchange, go by a variety of names, depending on the underwriter. Merrill Lynch calls its notes Strypes (for structured yield product exchangeable for stock). At Salomon, the name is Decs (for debt exchangeable for common stock).
For the sellers, the deals seem to offer the best of all worlds: cash without taxes and some upside potential with no downside risk. For the buyers, the lure is income for a few years that is better than in the underlying stock, while getting a large part of the stock's upside potential.

Bond Prices Finish Lower In Wake of Economic Data

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities traded in a narrow range yesterday before finishing moderately lower, as mixed readings of three separate economic reports kept investors off balance.
The price of the 30-year bond dropped 9/32 of a percentage point, to 87 16/32; its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, rose to 7.01 percent, up from 6.98 percent on Friday. The yield was the highest for the long bond since May 9, when it was 7.02 percent. 
 Traders considered the National Association of Purchasing Management's index for May weaker than expected -- it fell to 49.3 -- but they noted that its prices-paid component jumped to 50.8.
However, the Commerce Department reported that April construction spending rose 1.4 percent, a sign of a strengthening economy, and the Conference Board's index of leading indicators managed to eke out a gain of three-tenths of 1 percent in April, the third consecutive month the index has risen.
Despite the weak manufacturing sector as reported by the purchasing managers, the economy still appears to have been fairly strong in the spring. But the focus of market participants is already seen to be shifting to the payroll data that are scheduled to be released on Friday. Those figures will either raise the market's anxiety a bit or allay market fears of a resurgence of strong economic growth that would likely trigger inflation and force the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates to slow a rapid expansion.
Bond prices popped in early trading on rumors of a large hedge fund buying $500 million of bonds. But, traders said, if true, the fund was probably covering a position, not going long. Another rumor had a Washington advisory group quoting an unnamed Fed official as saying that the market's perception about tightening was overblown.
Still, "prices finished marginally lower," said David Ader, managing fixed-income analyst at Technical Data in Boston, "but we really have to wait for Friday's employment data before making any big decisions. Characteristically, with these marginal price changes came marginal volume, about 70 percent of a normal day."
Of the data released yesterday, Anthony Chan, the chief economist at the Banc One Investment Advisors Corporation in Columbus, Ohio, said that "the index of leading indicators failed to provide the credit markets with a clear indication of whether this growth will move into an overheated phase."
And of the April figure that construction spending rose 1.4 percent, Mr. Chan said that "the strength in this number, which came above expectations, was really overstated in lieu of the significant downward revision logged by the prior month's figures."
The purchasing managers' data, the one report that indicated a slowing economy, should have been more supportive of bonds, but was not because the price component surged, snuffing the market's enthusiasm.
"We should realize that inflation remains one of the market's hottest flash buttons," Mr. Chan said, "which means that any disappointment in this area is certain to rattle the nerves of most credit market investors. Markets are likely to move into a high sense of alert as the countdown towards Friday's release of the employment report proceeds."
At yesterday's weekly auction of Treasury bills, the average rates for the three- and six-month maturities were 5.09 percent and 5.21 percent, respectively. Rates were slightly higher than last week's auction, with the three-month bill considered a little on the weak side, with a bid-to-cover ratio of 3.79, and the six-month about average, with the bid-to-cover ratio at 4.07. The bid-to-cover ratio is the total dollar amount of all bids for the issue divided by the size of the auction.
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three- and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: Stocks Are Modestly Lower on More Interest-Rate Fears

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Stocks fell for a second session yesterday amid concern in some quarters that rising interest rates could limit corporate profit. Leading the decline were interest-sensitive utility and bank shares.
Stronger-than-expected vehicle sales at Chrysler, coupled with a report showing that manufacturing prices rose in May, led some investors to conclude that inflation could accelerate and force up rates. 
 "The market is very skittish about its principal fear -- that growth is too strong," said Wayne Nordberg, equity partner at Lord, Abbett & Company.
The Dow Jones industrial average slid 18.47 points, to 5,624.71, bringing its two-day drop to 68.70 points, or 1.2 percent. The blue-chip index, which reached a record close of 5,778.00 on May 22, was hurt as the shares of International Business Machines and American Express lost ground.
Broader markets also fell yesterday. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 1.44 points, to 667.68. And the Nasdaq composite index dropped 4.70 points, to 1,238.73.
At 317 million shares, trading on the New York Stock Exchange was the slowest since Feb. 15. Declining issues exceeded those advancing, 1,323 to 1,007.
The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 3 basis points, to 7.01 percent, after Chrysler's sales report. The auto maker said that its United States car and truck sales increased 17 percent in May, apparently unsettling those who think that economic growth is detrimental even for the stock market. Chrysler shares, though, rose 1 1/8, to 67 3/4.
In the broader market, telephone companies led declining issues. AT&T fell 3/4, to 61 5/8, and BellSouth retreated 1, to 39 5/8. Also falling in price were shares of electric utilities, whose dividends look less attractive next to fixed-income securities when interest rates rise. Among electric companies, People's Energy dropped 3/8, to 31 5/8, and the Southern Company fell 3/8, to 22 3/4.
Financial stocks declined on concerns of higher borrowing costs for lenders and slackening demand for new loans. American Express lost 3/4, to 45, MBNA fell 7/8, to 29 3/4, and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation lost 7/8, to 81 3/4.
Allstate, a property insurer, bucked the trend among stocks that are interest-rate sensitive. It rose 7/8, to 43 1/8, as Smith Barney reiterated a buy recommendation.
The shares of cyclical and consumer companies rose, after the National Association of Purchasing Management reported that its index of manufacturing activity dropped to 49.3 in May from 50.1 in April. A reading below 50 indicates that manufacturing industries are contracting.
Drug and beverage shares, which perform better than many other stocks when the economy slows, improved. So did chemical makers and retailers. Shares of Melville Corporation jumped 1, to 41 5/8, after the specialty retailer announced plans to streamline its operations. The company, which is based in Rye, N.Y., said it would sell its This End Up stores and spin off its CVS pharmacies faster than it had originally planned. It will also separate the operations of some units.
Anheuser-Busch rose 2 1/2, to 73 3/4.
Compaq Computer, the country's largest maker of PC's, rose 7/8, to 49 1/2, after it introduced a project with the Intel Corporation to enhance a line of servers powered by Intel's Pentium Pro microprocessors. Gateway 2000, a mail-order PC producer, rose 7/8, to 38 3/4.
Some other computer companies did not fare as well. I.B.M. fell 1 3/8, to 105 3/8, Hewlett-Packard lost 1 1/8, to 105 3/8, and Digital Equipment gave up 1 3/8, closing at 50 3/4.

HEADLINE: U.S. Seeking to Strengthen Nuclear Agency

BYLINE: By RAYMOND BONNER 

DATELINE: VIENNA, June 3

 BODY:
After the Persian Gulf war, when international inspectors got a better opportunity to look around a defeated Iraq, they discovered that President Saddam Hussein had secretly been developing nuclear weapons.
To deter such an ominous possibility from threatening the world again, Washington wants to strengthen the powers of the International Atomic Energy Agency, which is responsible for guarding against the diversion of nuclear material to bomb-making. 
 But the effort has run into determined resistance, not from rogue states bent on acquiring nuclear arsenals, but from two allies -- Germany and Japan -- that fear a new burden on their flourishing nuclear power industries.
While expressing commitment to nonproliferation, diplomats from each country, in separate interviews today, said the expanded powers that Washington is seeking for the atomic energy agency would place unfair economic and financial burdens on the owners of nuclear power plants.
Next week, the atomic energy agency's 35-member board of governors will meet in Vienna, where a majority of the nations will seek to persuade the Germans and Japanese to change their positions. The board operates by consensus, and the determined opposition of any member could scuttle the changes.
In broad terms, the new powers would require nuclear installations to provide more detailed reports about domestic nuclear activity and about the imports and exports of material that can be used to make nuclear weapons. Agency inspectors would also acquire more sweeping search authority.
"I'm in favor of it," said Gary Milhollin, director of the nonprofit Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control, about the agency's proposed new powers. But, he added, "there are some simple things the agency could do now on its own, to increase their credibility and effectiveness." Foremost, he said, the agency should make public much of what it now keeps confidential, such as the amount of nuclear material a country has.
Currently, the agency inspectors have authority to inspect only the nuclear plants that a government has declared exist. The agency strives to safeguard against the enrichment of uranium or production of plutonium, which can be used in nuclear warheads.
In Iraq, which is a member of the atomic energy agency, the inspectors had access to President Hussein's declared installations. But within the same compound, Iraq was developing nuclear weapons, in "undeclared" installations, which were off limits to the inspectors.
More recently, in North Korea, the Government had no problems with allowing the atomic energy agency to inspect declared sites. But when inspectors sought to look at sites the Government had not declared, but which American intelligence said were nuclear installations, the North Koreans balked, effectively confirming that they were developing their own nuclear weapons.
In principle, the German Government agrees that steps must be taken to stop these nations from getting nuclear weapons, said a senior German diplomat here.
But he said the expanded powers as now being sought for the agency would give inspectors from the international agency more legal rights to search private property than a German police officer has.
Concern about the economic and financial burden on operators of the nuclear installations is also at the foundation of Japanese objections to expanding the atomic energy agency's power, said Makoto Yamanaka, a senior diplomat at the Japanese mission to the United Nations organizations in Vienna.
Mr. Yamanaka said the burden of atomic energy inspections is already greater on Japan than on other countries, because of its large nuclear industry.
The American representative to the United Nations here, John B. Ritch 3d, agreed that Germany and Japan will bear a greater burden than other countries, including the United States.
But, he added, "the enormous benefits to global security from deterring, or at least detecting, a future Saddam Hussein, overwhelm the modest burdens involved."

HEADLINE: Union Pacific's Plan to Merge Hits Resistance At 3 Agencies

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT 

 BODY:
The Justice, Transportation and Agriculture Departments said yesterday that they were against a proposed $3.9 billion merger of the Union Pacific Corporation and the Southern Pacific Rail Corporation.
While the Justice Department's word can often make or break mergers, it has carried less weight in the railroad industry, which has seen steady consolidation since it was deregulated in 1980. 
 The opinions of the three agencies -- which are only recommendations -- are among many being submitted to the Surface Transportation Board, which will make its final ruling next month on a merger that would form the nation's largest railroad, linking about 35,000 miles of track from the Midwest to the Pacific and from Canada to Mexico.
The Justice Department said that denying the merger was "the most certain, effective and expeditious way to preserve competition." It said, for example, that reduced competition could cost shippers as much as $800 million a year in higher prices.
For its part, the Agriculture Department said it was concerned that the merger would reduce farm income, and the Transportation Department said it feared a lack of competition and higher prices for consumers.
Scott Flower, a railroad industry analyst at Paine Webber, said that the Cabinet departments' opinions were not surprising, and that the opinions of shippers would probably be more influential with the Surface Transportation Board. For example, the board's predecessor, the Interstate Commerce Commission, routinely disregarded Justice Department advisory opinions and approved rail mergers.
"I still think that at the end of the day, the merger will be approved," Mr. Flower said.
The merger has been opposed by the National Industrial Transportation League and the Texas Railroad Commission. But a Union Pacific spokesman said that it had received letters of support for the merger from 1,321 shippers representing 42 percent of the combined revenue of the two railroads. Union Pacific officials, however, did not know how many others among its customers were indifferent or opposed to the merger.
"This merger proposal is overwhelmingly pro-competitive," said Richard K. Davidson, Union Pacific's president. "We feel confident that the S.T.B. will be able to separate the wheat from the chaff."
The proposed Union Pacific and Southern Pacific merger is the latest example of a broad trend toward consolidation among railroads that has reshaped the industry since deregulation.
Since then, the number of major railways in the United States has declined to 10 from 26. In an effort to cut costs, many railroads have merged to achieve economies of scale and more efficient operations that cover vast swaths of the country.
Union Pacific, for example, has said that savings achieved by merging the two operations could exceed $500 million a year within three years, through plant and equipment consolidations, among other measures.
Although being biggest is not necessarily the most important goal of railroads, their customers are increasingly demanding that rail companies offer as broad a range of services as possible. In addition, mergers are seen by railroads as perhaps the best route to new levels of profitability.
But Federal agencies like the Justice and Transportation Departments see the threat of decreased competition in the effort by Union Pacific and Southern Pacific to merge. They said, for example, that major parts of their route networks would have to be sold by the railroads to receive approval, including routes in Texas and California.
The Surface Transportation Board is scheduled to rule on the transaction on July 3.
The departments' recommendations were made after the stock market closed. Earlier, shares of Union Pacific rose 87.5 cents, to $71, on the New York Stock Exchange; Southern Pacific shares rose 12.5 cents, to $24.50.

HEADLINE: Sales Climbed 17% in May For Chrysler

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: DETROIT, June 3

 BODY:
Chrysler and General Motors reported unexpectedly strong sales for May.
Chrysler's sales in the United States jumped 17 percent in May to a monthly record, helped by big rebates on cars and a better supply of mini-vans. G.M.'s sales rose 7.2 percent from last May, about double what analysts had expected, on rapid sales of Chevrolet Cavalier cars and Tahoe sport utility vehicles. 
 Chrysler's car sales, which have not been as strong as its light-truck sales in almost a year, rose 20 percent in May from May 1995. Meanwhile, mini-vans, in short supply last year as factories changed to a new model, helped push Chrysler's light-truck sales up 16 percent.
"Chrysler continues to be extremely well positioned; the company can do very little wrong and that will continue into '97," said Paul Ballew, chief economist for J. D. Power & Associates. Chrysler shares closed up $1.125, at $67.75.
General Motors' car sales rose 6.6 percent, while sales of light trucks, the category that includes mini-vans, pickups and sport utility vehicles, rose 8.1 percent. G.M. shares rose $1 to $56.125. Analysts expect overall industry sales for May to rise 5 percent, to an annual selling rate of about 15.1 million vehicles.
While industry sales through May were at an expected annual rate of 15 million to 15.1 million vehicles, industry executives say sales for the year could be as little as 14.8 million vehicles, or up just slightly from last year's 14.7 million.
In an indication that Chrysler itself is not terribly confident the economy will be strong enough to sustain car sales, the company today extended an incentive program that has chopped the prices of most of its cars by $1,000 to $3,500. However, in response to strong demand, Chrysler eliminated a $300 rebate on its V-8 powered regular-cab Ram pickups. Chrysler sold 89,344 cars last month and 155,945 light trucks. The Ford Motor Company and several Japanese auto makers are expected to release their May sales Tuesday.
Among Japanese auto makers that reported sales results, the Nissan Motor Company disappointed analysts with a 16 percent drop in May sales. Analysts had expected a small gain. Nissan said a deliberate reduction in its sales to fleet buyers caused the decline. Nissan's domestic car sales fell 14.3 percent, its domestic truck sales fell 25 percent and its import car sales fell 17.7 percent.

HEADLINE: Reports Show More Strength In Economy

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 3

 BODY:
More signs of economic strength appeared today, as a major forecasting index showed its third straight gain and the Government reported a sizable, broad-based rise in new construction.
A gauge based on a poll of purchasing managers, who buy goods for factories, eased slightly in May, but analysts said the report implied at least a steady pace of manufacturing in coming months. And new orders from foreign customers, which are not included in the main purchasing index, were particularly strong, the report said. 
 "It does look like the economy has a lot of momentum behind it," said James F. O'Sullivan, an analyst at the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company.
Because of the risks of overheating, he said, the Federal Reserve is likely to tighten monetary policy during the summer, probably at the meeting in August of the Federal Open Market Committee.
But Michelle C. Laughlin, the chief economist at Sanwa Bank, said she thought the Fed would "skate by" without having to raise rates, even if gross domestic product surged at a 3.5 percent annual rate in the quarter that ends on June 30, as she said she expected.
In the bond market, interest rates, which are sensitive to signs of economic strength because of traders' worries about inflation, rose modestly today.
A report by the Conference Board, the economic research group, showed that its index of leading economic indicators had climbed three-tenths of 1 percent in April. This duplicated the March gain and, combined with a 1.3 percent surge in February, meant that the index has risen for three months in a row for the first time since late 1993.
Seven of the 11 components of the index rose in April, the significant contributors being higher new orders at factories for consumer goods and materials, a rise in prices of items especially sensitive to business conditions and a lower number of first-time claims for unemployment benefits.
The price of sensitive materials is by far the most heavily weighted part of the index, accounting for 40.5 percent of the overall figure. Its rise for April is likely to be reversed in May, analysts said, because of an easing of oil prices.
The chief items holding down the index for April were a decline in orders and contracts for plant and equipment, a reduction in consumer expectations and a decline in the M-2 money supply.
The companion indexes of coincident and lagging indicators showed increases of three-tenths of 1 percent and two-tenths of 1 percent, respectively. The Conference Board, which is based in New York, took over the compilation of the indexes from the Government last year.
The Commerce Department's report on construction spending showed a 1.4 percent rise in April, spread equally between the public sector, which includes projects like sewers and schools, and the private sector.
Within the latter, home building climbed 1.4 percent despite higher interest rates, while business and other nonresidential construction jumped 2.1 percent, nearly double the gain in March.
The purchasing managers' overall index eased to 49.3 points in May from 50.1 in April, a reading somewhat weaker than expected.
The decline was mainly a result of an inventory drawdown that may set the stage for a possible rebound in production if demand quickens.
Ms. Laughlin calculated that if lower inventories were counted as a plus instead of a minus, the National Association of Purchasing Management's index would have risen.
Other elements of the report showed fractional increases in production, employment and supplier deliveries.
New export orders climbed to 56.9 points from 51.4, a favorable omen for an economy that expanded at a solid pace in the first quarter with little help from trade. Prices paid by purchasing managers rose to 50.8 points from 40.1, a development that aroused little concern, Mr. O'Sullivan said, because the April figure was abnormally low and the May number reflected a temporary surge in oil prices.

New York Places Campaign in Review

BYLINE: By Edwin McDowell 

 BODY:
The New York State Department of Economic Development said yesterday that it had placed in review its travel and tourism account, known as the "I [Love] New York" campaign. The account has been handled by Ogilvy & Mather New York since January 1995. Though the 1997 spending has been estimated at $11.5 million, the department said it would entertain proposals to parcel projects out to various agencies.
Linda Wohlers, deputy commissioner for advertising, marketing and tourism at the department in Albany, confirmed a report of the review this week in Adweek. She said, "We like Ogilvy's work, but we are just reviewing our options and seeing what's out there." Ms. Wohlers said the department was also "relooking at the way we generally do tourism advertising," adding that the department wanted to add fall, winter and international advertising to its traditional summer and spring campaigns. 
 The department has sent out more than 1,000 requests for proposals, including inviting Ogilvy, a unit of the WPP Group, to compete in the review. A decision is expected by the end of June, Ms. Wohlers added.

DATELINE: CAMDEN

 BODY:
After more than a year of negotiations, the state agreed yesterday to allow Camden to set up an Empowerment Zone, a move that will eventually bring the economically depressed city $21 million in Federal money. To win the state's support, Camden had to agree to set up a nonprofit organization to run the program and establish specific goals and schedules for what the city expected to accomplish, said Robert W. Friant, a spokesman for the State Department of Community Affairs. 
 "We intend to monitor the money and make sure it is spent wisely," Mr. Friant said. State officials have been highly critical of the way Camden is run.

HEADLINE: Japanese Chips May Scramble U.S. Export Ban

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 3

 BODY:
The Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation has quietly begun selling a powerful data-scrambling chip set that is likely to undermine the Clinton Administration's efforts to restrict the export of the fundamental technology for protecting secrets and commerce in the information age.
The existence of the two-chip set, which will have broad potential application for local computer networks, the Internet and telephone switching networks, was disclosed here in a speech today at a public policy workshop by the chief executive of RSA Data Security, a Silicon Valley-based company that has frequently dueled with the Administration over its export-control policies. 
 The executive, Jim Bidzos, said that his company was negotiating with N.T.T., the giant telecommunications concern, to resell the chips in the United States. Mr. Bidzos also said that N.T.T. had already made sales in 15 countries, including in the United States to I.B.M.
"N.T.T. has done a lot of research and development work on this product," he said. "There is clearly going to be a lot of demand for their chips."
An executive at NTT America said that although there were no restrictions on the export of cryptographic hardware or software from Japan, his company was still anxious to obtain software from RSA Data to use in its chips. That software is still controlled by United States export law, he said.
"We'd like to use this technology," said Junichi Kishigami, director of NTT America, which is based in Mountain View, Calif. "It is important to employ good international standards."
Mr. Bidzos has been a vocal and longtime opponent of United States export laws that prohibit the sale, without a special license, of products that have powerful data-scrambling capabilities. The Government's policy is directed at limiting the spread of systems that could make it more difficult for American intelligence and law-enforcement agencies to conduct electronic surveillance.
Such restrictions have been bitterly opposed in recent years by American computer and telecommunications companies; they have argued that the technology is already widely available internationally and that manufacturers and software developers in the United States are in danger of losing markets to foreign competitors. The N.T.T. technology would seem to support those contentions.
"The United States export controls are at risk from Japanese competition," said Stewart Baker, a Washington lawyer who is the former general counsel for the National Security Agency.
The N.T.T. device also underscores fundamental differences that exist between Japan and the United States on the issue of privacy in the information age.
While United States officials have struggled to maintain their ability to conduct electronic surveillance, Article 21 of Japan's Constitution specifically forbids wiretapping.
"It's very interesting that the Japanese regard for privacy in their Constitution translates into better cryptographic technology," said Marc Rotenberg, director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a Washington public policy group and an organizer of today's workshop on data scrambling.
Mr. Bidzos said that N.T.T.'s chips, which have been developed and manufactured by a subsidiary, N.T.T. Electronic Labs, were far more powerful than the so-called Clipper chip, a data-scrambling system that the Clinton Administration proposed for the nation's telephone system.
While the Clipper system has a built-in "back door" intended to permit the F.B.I. to gain wiretap information, the N.T.T. system has no such surveillance feature. It also uses much stronger data-encryption algorithms than United States export laws permit.
Those laws restrict the export of encryption systems which employ digital "keys" of more than 40 bits in length. The new N.T.T chips, however, are based on the United States data encryption standard, which has a 56-bit key, and actually triples the strength of that standard. Such a scrambling system is believed to be beyond the capability of the most powerful code-breaking system.
In addition to the "private" key system for scrambling data, N.T.T. uses RSA Data's "public" key method to permit computer users who have not previously exchanged information to swap private key information safely. The N.T.T. system uses the RSA Data key, which is 1,024 bits in length, also far stronger than the United States export regulations permit.
"If there is anyone in the Government who hasn't already seen the writing on the wall, here it is," Mr. Bidzos said.
He said that RSA Data had set up a small subsidiary in Japan last year and that he was now negotiating with N.T.T. to make a minority investment in that subsidiary in exchange for N.T.T.'s gaining access to the RSA Data public key technology.
The N.T.T. technology is at least partly the result of an initiative by Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry, which 18 months ago made a $120 million national commitment to develop products to facilitate electronic commerce.
"This is a major business opportunity that the Japanese see clearly," said Deborah Hurley, an official at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the Paris-based international group.
RSA Data was acquired in April by Security Dynamics Technologies Inc., a computer security company based in Cambridge, Mass., in a stock deal valued at $250 million. Mr. Bidzos said that the two companies had continued to operate relatively independently.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: BALANCED BUDGET;
Dole Plans a Swan Song: A 2d Vote on Amendment

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

DATELINE: WARREN, Mich., June 3

 BODY:
Setting the course for his final days in the Senate, Bob Dole announced today that he would bring up the proposed constitutional amendment requiring a balanced Federal budget for what he expects to be another losing vote.
Mr. Dole, addressing a lunchtime audience of business leaders here, called on President Clinton to reverse course and endorse the amendment. But he, and Dole aides who predicted that the measure would receive fewer than the 66 votes it gained in defeat 15 months ago, also said they did not expect such a reversal from Mr. Clinton. 
 "I'm not holding my breath," the Senator said.
Had he been, he would not have had to hold it for long. At the White House soon afterward, the President rejected the call for his support, saying the process of adopting a constitutional amendment would merely put off budget-balancing decisions that could be made immediately if Republican Congressional leaders would accept his invitation to return to the negotiating table with him.
Whatever Mr. Dole's hopes for the amendment, his presenting it again, particularly at so high profile a moment -- in effect, a legislative valedictory for the departing Senate majority leader -- will put Mr. Clinton in the politically awkward position of once more lobbying against an immensely popular measure.
"If you are serious as you say about balancing the Federal budget," the Senator told Mr. Clinton in the speech here, "if you really have had a change of heart, if you truly want to stand with the American people, tell your Democratic colleagues in the Senate to vote for the balanced-budget amendment.
"Do it in public. And do it now. No winks. No nods. No behind-the-scenes maneuvers. No excuses. And do it loudly. And do it clearly. As they say in the commercial, just do it."
Even before his remarks here, Mr. Dole had been expected to schedule the amendment for a vote before his departure from the Senate. Today he said he would bring it up either Thursday or next Tuesday, the day by which he is to resign.
If all goes according to plan, the vote may prove to be one of the few successful executions of what was once his Presidential campaign strategy: to use his influence as Senate majority leader to set the agenda for the race. The vote is scheduled to coincide with a round of Republican television commercials on the same subject, Mr. Dole's aides said.
For all the difficulties Mr. Dole's move may pose for Mr. Clinton, it also highlights a continuing debate over economic policy in his own camp. Mr. Dole, an unwavering advocate of deficit elimination who first introduced a balanced-budget amendment as a first-term Senator in 1971, has been under increasing pressure from Republican advisers to offer a proposal for a broad tax cut.
Today Mr. Dole, who in his visit here was accompanied by Senator Spencer Abraham of Michigan, one of the Republicans urging a 15 percent across-the-board reduction in Federal income taxes, made clear that he was committed to some kind of tax cut, and said he did not believe that budget-balancing would have to be sacrificed for it.
"I believe we can cut taxes, reform the tax code and balance the budget," Mr. Dole said. But he did not say how all that might be done.
A New York Times/CBS News Poll shows Americans divided over whether the Government can reduce its budget deficit and cut taxes at the same time. They are also divided over which is preferable.
In the poll, conducted by telephone among 880 adults across the nation from Friday through Sunday, 46 percent of respondents said it was possible to reduce the deficit and cut taxes, the same number who said it was not possible. Forty-nine percent said they would rather cut the deficit than reduce taxes, while 47 percent chose tax reduction over deficit-cutting.
The poll, whose margin of sampling error was plus or minus three percentage points, also found that most Americans did not think their taxes would be cut no matter who was elected President. Given the prospect of a second Clinton term, 58 percent of respondents said taxes would stay the same, 32 percent said they would increase, and only 2 percent said they would decline. Offered the prospect of a Dole Presidency, 42 percent said their taxes would stay the same, 39 percent said they would increase, and 10 percent said they would decline.
Mr. Dole's talk to the business leaders took place at a community college here in Macomb County, a Detroit suburb that in political circles has become renowned as an electoral laboratory for Mr. Clinton and his advisers, who have studied voting trends to understand the defection of Democratic voters to Ronald Reagan.
Mr. Dole linked the balanced-budget amendment to his portrayal of Mr. Clinton as liberal and untrustworthy. He said the President had repeatedly "demonstrated his fundamental hostility to restraining the growth of government."
In Washington, Mr. Clinton dismissed Mr. Dole's call for a constitutional amendment. "It puts off the decision," the President told reporters covering a ceremony in the White House Rose Garden. "We can balance the budget tomorrow. All he has to do is come back to the negotiations. They walked out months ago."
In a sign of White House concern over the potency of the tax-cut issue, Mr. Clinton's aides said he would use his commencement speech at Princeton University on Tuesday to propose a tax benefit to help offset the costs of higher education. The White House said the proposal would be a tax credit to cover two years of schooling beyond high school, and would supplement Mr. Clinton's longstanding proposal for a $10,000 deduction for post-high-school education.
As for the deficit, Mr. Clinton's aides noted that it had been reduced to $164 billion in 1995, from $290 billion three years earlier. But Mr. Dole cast the President as a consistent opponent of a balanced budget, noting that Mr. Clinton had vetoed a Republican budget-balancing plan with the argument that it would gut Medicare and other social programs.
"He has fought us at every step of the way," Mr. Dole said. "He sent up a smoke screen of rhetoric. He used scare tactics and every bit of patronage and power he had to strong-arm members of his own party and keep them in line."

BOB DOLE
From a speech at Macomb County Community College in Michigan yesterday, as transcribed by the Federal News Service: 
 "Let me start by saying that in this campaign the American people's biggest challenge will be to distinguish between words and actions. That is, because unfortunately, as we have seen time and time again, the words this President speaks have very little to do with the actions he takes. Put simply, he talks right and runs left.
But I believe the American people deserve better than zigzag leadership, and nowhere is this disconnect more true than on the question of the Federal budget. And nowhere is it more pivotal. For whether or not we actually bring the budget into balance in the next few years will depend, more than anything else, on the will and determination of the President of the United States. And as things stand in the Congress and the country today, if the President of the United States wants a balanced budget, we will have a balanced budget.
But this President's action made clear that he does not. I do. I do because I believe a Federal budget that is balanced in the right way, with less spending, that permits lower taxes, is a key, a critical key, to making America better for families and to restarting America's engine of economic growth.
Now some say that, well, deficits don't matter, that the American people just don't care about them. But the fact is that the Federal budget is like a tax hike on working families. It drives up interest rates, and not by a little but by a lot. It is a stealth tax that every family with a home, every father and mother with a child in college, every young person who buys a car must pay -- and pay and pay and pay. . . .
And I say this stealth tax is wrong. It's wrong for families. It's wrong for workers. And it's wrong for our economy. . . .
If the American people vote on a balanced budget tomorrow, it would pass by an overwhelming majority: 83 percent, according to a recent Gallup Poll. In this, Washington should learn from the wisdom of the American people.
So let me say it right now. Mr. Clinton, we all know that your Democratic colleagues in the Senate will look to you for a thumbs up or a thumbs down on this vote. You are the leader of one of America's two great parties. Your leadership on this issue matters. It really matters. And if you are serious as you say about balancing the Federal budget, if you really have had a change of heart, if you truly want to stand with the American people, tell your Democratic colleagues in the Senate to vote for the balanced-budget amendment.
And, Mr. President, do it in public. And do it now. No winks. No nods. No behind-the-scenes maneuvers. No excuses. And do it loudly. And do it clearly.
As they say in the commercial, just do it. Just do it."

HEADLINE: Let's Pay U.N. Debt For Future's Sake

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 The cliche that "some people never learn" is being played out in Congress today. The issue is the severe financial crisis confronting the United Nations, due primarily to the refusal of Congress to pay the $1.5 billion America owes the world body in back dues and peacekeeping assessments.
The reference to not learning is that it was also Congress that doomed the League of Nations by refusing American membership, thus creating an international political vacuum that led to the carnage of World War II. 
 The same myopic and jingoist attitude rules Congress today; thus the abdication of our financial and moral responsibility to the United Nations. The irony, and the affront to the world community, is that the entire U.N. debt is less than the cost of a single B-2 bomber.
Surely we have the intelligence to understand that the United Nations could not be created in today's divided world. It must be maintained, as this world organization is the key to coordinating resolution of our global problems, and to creating the foundation for the emerging global village of the 21st century.
The message to Congress, and to President Clinton, is to pay the debt, honor our commitment and take the lead in supporting and strengthening the U.N. Our future generations depend on it.

HEADLINE: Singapore Journal;
Good Life Guide: To 5 C's, Like Cash, Add Clout

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: SINGAPORE, June 4

 BODY:
"Let's grow up!" scolded Singapore's leader, Lee Kuan Yew, lecturing his countrymen on what he called the facts of life in an unfair world.
Even his tailor and his shoemaker give him discounts, he said. Even the pharmaceutical company Johnson & Johnson hustled to provide an implant for his recent heart operation, eager for the publicity. 
 "I am me," said Mr. Lee, who now holds the title of Senior Minister after serving for 31 years as Prime Minister. "It's not a level playing field."
Mr. Lee was speaking in Parliament two weeks ago to defuse a crisis over his personal finances that no one here really wanted. Even opposition deputies were quick to say they saw no wrongdoing.
But a report in the foreign press that he and his son, Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, had accepted more than $700,000 in discounts for luxury condominiums touched a nerve.
The news set off an impassioned nationwide debate over the rising costs of good housing and, more broadly, over the increasing elusiveness of something called the "Singapore dream."
At its crudest, this unabashedly materialistic dream is summarized by what is known here as the Five C's: cash, credit card, car, condo and country club.
Mr. Lee framed the question in an address to Parliament: "The dream -- is it out of reach?"
Even as its economy continues to soar, Singapore is suffering a version of the American fear that this could be the first generation not to exceed the living standards of its parents. And it is the tangible symbol of enfranchisement -- a private home -- that has become the focus of busy Singapore's frisson of angst.
Scarce land in this island city-state of three million people has driven the price of private housing beyond the reach of most people, even the affluent young professionals who are its vanguard.
Real estate prices have tripled in the last six years, making it harder than ever for people to realize their goal of moving out of the Government apartment blocks -- sometimes called pigeonholes -- where 85 percent of Singaporeans live.
Always efficient, the Government has hurried to address the problem, acting to free up additional public land and revise laws of ownership and inheritance. And the Lees donated the money from their discounts to charity.
But the social contract had been shaken, and people voiced a sense of betrayal.
"In paternalistic Singapore, we are told, 'Just listen to us and keep your nose clean and everything will be all right,' " said a professional woman in her early 30's who asked not to be identified.
"I studied, I got my degree, I got a good job," she said. "I did everything right, and it looks like I'll be living with my mother the rest of my life. I didn't make any eccentric choices; I didn't go into the arts or anything like that, and where's the payoff?"
In a plaint that is widely quoted here, Phua Mei Pin, a 19-year-old intern at The Straits Times, which generally presents the Government line, wrote in the newspaper last week of her generation's increasing disillusionment.
"I am not asking for an emperor's condos and stables of Benzes, just a small place I can belong to and that can belong to me," she wrote. "Already I have friends who are drawing up blueprints of their futures in Australia and America, where they believe they can stretch the same dollar much further."
In this context, the disclosure of the Lees' discounts set off reverberations that may be an issue in parliamentary elections to be held before next April. As always, there is no question that the ruling party, the People's Action Party, will win. But questions of property, privilege and the Singapore dream may now dominate the campaign.
The election will also be held in the context of Mr. Lee's advancing age -- he is 72 -- and his two recent heart operations in which an implant called a stent was inserted into an artery. Though he seems fit, Singaporeans have been reminded of the mortality of the man who created their affluent and orderly society in his own image and still watches over it.
Thus no one in Parliament seemed eager to attack the probity of the elder statesman who embodies the character of their nation. Nobody in Asia disputes that Singapore is the region's most corruption-free state.
One of Mr. Lee's contributions is that, in contrast to some of his authoritarian neighbors, he has not clung to office but has put in place a procedure for succession. An ally, Goh Chok Tong, is Prime Minister, and Mr. Lee's son is a possible successor to Mr. Goh.
Mr. Lee told Parliament that it was his "most serious challenge" to see that the "pristine quality" of government that he created survives him. "There are no gangsters running in Singapore," he said. "You win or lose on your merit. We have formed our own rules."
But as Mr. Lee made plain, corruption is one thing; unfairness is another. "It is an unfair and unequal world," he said, in a speech that was broadcast repeatedly here. "If you want an equal world you end up with a Communist world with Mao's salaries."
As one hedge against corruption, Singapore pays its top ministers as if they were rock stars -- nearly $1.3 million for Mr. Lee last year and nearly $1 million for his son -- and they get rock-star treatment.
Perks are offered, and accepted.
"Johnson & Johnson's representative in Singapore saw the point of having a stent put in a coronary artery of someone who is well known," Mr. Lee said in the tones of a patient teacher.
"Even my tailor, my shoemaker," he said. "My tailor comes to my office. Any fitting which is not comfortable, he sees on television, he says, 'Oh, send back that coat.' His reputation is at stake. To unpick and unstitch is a very, very laborious exercise on blue sandwashed silk. But, 'No trouble,' he said. I am his walking model."
Like other prominent figures, Mr. Lee and his son were sold their apartments at a "soft sale" before bids were opened to the public. Long lines of buyers form once celebrities have been served and public sales begin. Even places in line are sold for large sums.
Mr. Lee told young Singaporean professionals desperate to achieve their dream that they must stand in line behind him.
"It's a fact of life," he said. "There is no way of me having to join a queue to buy a house, or my wife. All I need to do -- which I have not done -- is to tell my secretary to ring up Mr. Ng Teng Fong or Kwek Leng Joo," two prominent developers.
And Mr. Lee would simply say, "I like that development."
"Even if all the units were sold, they will find a unit for me, surely," he said, "or Mr. Ng Teng Fong wouldn't be Mr. Ng Teng Fong. Let's grow up!"

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Gains on Yen and Mark As Traders Bet on Foreign Rates

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar rose against the Japanese yen yesterday, briefly breaking above 109 yen, but gave up some of the gains while remaining at 28-month highs.
The dollar also rose against the German mark and most other leading currencies. 
 Traders bought dollars betting that Japan's halting economic recovery and continued sluggishness in Germany would keep interest rates from rising in those countries.
Relatively higher interest rates in the United States make investments denominated in dollars more valuable, prompting higher demand for the currency.
After peaking at 109.35 yen -- the highest since Feb. 4, 1994 -- the dollar settled in New York at 108.85 yen, up from 108.37 yen on Monday.
The dollar traded at 1.5300 marks, up from 1.5279 marks on Monday. The British pound was quoted at $1.5497, down from $1.5505.
David de Rosa, a director of foreign exchange trading with SBC Warburg in New York, said the dollar tested the 109 level several times yesterday, but fell back slightly from that peak after Martin Zimmerman, chief economist at the Ford Motor Company, expressed concern that the rally would reduce exports from Ford and other American producers.
Mr. Zimmerman said in a television interview that these concerns have been presented to the Clinton Administration, which has given assurances that it will defend specific foreign exchange levels.
"That pretty much capped the rise in the dollar-yen for the day; it was such a direct comment," Mr. de Rosa said.
Although the Japanese economy is growing, the inconsistency of the growth has convinced many market players that interest rates in Japan will be kept low so as not to endanger the recovery, he said.
Traders are expected to get their next view of Japan's recovery on Friday, when the country is scheduled to release its survey of business sentiment in the second quarter.
On the same day, the Labor Department in Washington is to issue its May report on employment. Any strong rise in jobs, beyond the 150,000 or so forecast by economists, could help the dollar, because it would increase the chance that the Federal Reserve would raise short-term interest rates.
In other currency trading, the dollar rose to 1.2559 Swiss francs, from 1.2526 on Monday, and to 5.1780 French francs, from 5.1720. The Canadian dollar slipped to 73.05 United States cents, from 73.09.

HEADLINE: April Orders To Factories Slipped 0.1%

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 4

 BODY:
Weaker sales of aircraft cut the value of orders to factories in April, the Commerce Department said today, but other goods posted gains as depleted inventories of new cars were rebuilt.
Total orders eased down by one-tenth of a percent, to a seasonally adjusted level of $309.1 billion, after an increase of 1.7 percent in March, a figure that was revised upward from the original report of a 1.5 percent gain. The decline in orders in April was concentrated in the volatile aircraft sector, in which multibillion-dollar orders tend to come in batches. 
 Orders rose for other manufactured items, especially cars, after the end of a 17-day strike at a General Motors plant in March, and also for computers and primary metals. Steeper oil prices raised the prices of orders to refineries.
Excluding transportation goods, factory orders jumped 1.9 percent in April -- the strongest gain since 2.7 percent in August 1994 -- after a decrease of one-tenth of a percent in March.
"The fact is that inventory-trimming now is behind us, and we're going to see more and more factories cranking up production to replenish inventories," said Sung Won Sohn, an economist at the Norwest Corporation in Minneapolis.
"We'll see sustained growth in orders over coming months, but I think it'll be very modest growth," Mr. Sohn said.
In April, factory orders for durable goods, which include transportation products like cars and airplanes as well as refrigerators and other hard goods intended to last three years or more, fell 1.9 percent, to $166 billion, after a 2.6 percent gain in March.
Orders for nondurables like processed food and paper rose strongly, jumping 2 percent, to $143 billion, after an increase of seven-tenths of a percent in March.
Over all, transportation orders plunged 12.8 percent, to $37.9 billion -- the biggest monthly decline since a 14.8 percent drop in July 1994 -- after a 14.6 percent surge in March.
Shipments of motor vehicles and parts jumped 12.3 percent in April, after a 6.8 percent drop in March, when many G.M. plants were idled because of the strike.
The report on factory orders fit with other recent indications of modestly increased manufacturing.
Shipments of manufactured goods, which reflect more immediate demand than factory orders do, climbed 1.7 percent in April after a rise of three-tenths of a percent in March.

HEADLINE: Ford Reports Slim Sales Gain As Some Models Lose Ground

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: DEARBORN, Mich., June 4

 BODY:
The Ford Motor Company's domestic vehicle sales rose just 1.3 percent in May, and sales of many models were lower, the company said today.
Ford's Lincoln luxury-car line posted weak results, as did the Ford Thunderbird and Mercury Cougar -- two cars Ford has told suppliers it will replace eventually with a small sport utility vehicle. Ford's car sales fell 1.6 percent, eating into the company's sales of light trucks, like pickups, sport utility vehicles and mini-vans, which edged up 3.9 percent. 
 "They are having a hard time giving away their new car models, while customers are winding up around the block to buy their trucks," David Healy, an analyst with Burnham Securities, said.
One bright spot for Ford: the Taurus regained its lead over the Honda Accord as the nation's best-selling car. So far this year, Ford has sold 162,156 Taurus cars, compared with 154,109 Accords.
For the United States industry, strong sales at the Chrysler Corporation and the General Motors Corporation more than offset Ford's lackluster performance. The industry beat most forecasts with a 7 percent rise in May, and an annual sales pace of 15.9 million vehicles. Ford sold 195,827 light trucks and 174,981 cars in May.
The auto industry is growing faster than expected, giving a healthy lift to the nation's economy. Chrysler's 17 percent jump in May sales, followed by General Motors' 7.2 percent gain, made some bond investors fear that the economy was growing too rapidly, possibly presaging a rise in inflation.
Concerns that the Federal Reserve might raise bank lending rates were allayed by the perception that bond yields have climbed enough to compensate for the risk.
Detroit's auto makers have already increased their production targets to keep pace with sales.
"The numbers keep coming in stronger than Detroit expects," Mr. Healy said. "I wouldn't be surprised to see some further small increases in their forecasts for the year."
General Motors is expected to raise second-quarter production.
Ford shares rose 25 cents, to $36.625.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Apple Plans An Offering Of 6% Notes

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER 

 BODY:
Apple Computer Inc. said yesterday that it would offer $575 million in convertible debt, in what analysts called a positive step by the troubled company to raise cash.
Apple's offering was announced as Treasury prices recovered from an early slide to end slightly higher for the first time in three sessions. 
 Treasury prices fell in early trading after a report showed that excluding transportation goods, factory orders jumped 1.9 percent in April, raising fears about robust economic growth fueling inflation.
While prices managed to bounce back, the gains came on light trading, with many market participants on the sidelines awaiting the release of May employment data on Friday.
The Treasury market has been bearish in recent weeks, held down by concerns that further signs of an economic pickup will prompt the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates sometime this year to curb inflation.
Still, the market has seen its expectations upset several times this year, increasing the anxiety surrounding the next jobs report.
"While there was not a lot going on in terms of trading today, there was a lot going on in terms of planning," said Waldo T. Best, senior economist at BZW Securities Inc.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 3/32 of a percentage point, to 87 19/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, slipped to 7 percent from 7.01 percent on Monday.
Apple's notes, due in 2001, pay 6 percent -- 62 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, less than a five-year Treasury note. The notes can be converted into shares of Apple stock at $29.205 a share, 20 percent higher than Apple's closing price of $24.1875 yesterday. The notes are rated B-, which is junk-bond status.
Analysts said that while the terms of the offering were somewhat onerous to Apple, the deal had to be generous to attract investors.
Nonetheless, they said getting the company's balance sheet in order was a positive step, and one that reflected well on Gilbert F. Amelio's efforts as Apple's new chairman and chief executive.
"This deal was designed to sell quickly and without controversy," said Daniel Kunstler, an analyst with J. P. Morgan Securities in San Francisco. "The terms are definitely good for investors, and from Apple's perspective, it removes the specter of any kind of liquidity crisis in the near term. The alternative to raising money at these rates was not to raise money."
The debt offering, which was underwritten by Goldman, Sachs & Company, will allow Apple to retire about $352 million in short-term borrowings, which have maturity dates ranging from June 28 to Sept. 30 of this year.
The notes will also help cushion Apple from its recent losses. Apple reported a loss of $740 million for its second quarter, ended March 29, which it attributed primarily to inventory write-downs of $388 million after tax for unsold products and restructuring charges of $130 million after tax.
Apple had just $500 million in cash at the end of the second quarter, down from $1.38 billion in the corresponding period a year earlier.
Apple's senior debt was recently downgraded two notches to B1 from Ba2 by Moody's Investors Service Inc., which said it expected the company's sales to decline during the next 12 to 18 months. B1 is four notches below investment grade, or in the junk-bond category.
Last week, Mr. Amelio announced a management reorganization, naming a chief operating officer and executives to lead four product groups.

HEADLINE: Refashioning NATO

 BODY:
NATO, the Atlantic military alliance spawned and shaped by the cold war, has taken an important step toward restructuring itself for the needs of a new era. Foreign ministers from its 16 member nations agreed in Berlin Monday on more flexible ways for European members of the alliance to respond to future regional crises that do not require American military might.
The new formulas, if carefully applied, can have a double advantage for the United States. They may reduce unwanted pressure on Washington to commit American ground troops when NATO forces enter a conflict. They will also permit the reintegration of French military units into NATO operations, ending the 30-year estrangement begun by Charles de Gaulle. Considerable credit is due France's current President, Jacques Chirac, a Gaullist himself, whose military reforms did much to make the changes possible. 
Larger NATO operations, like the current mission in Bosnia, will still require American ground troops. But more modest undertakings, like a possible successor mission in Bosnia, limited peacekeeping assignments or emergency evacuations, might not. Under the new ground rules, NATO's European members could initiate operations using American-supplied equipment, transport and intelligence, provided that all NATO members, including Washington, give their approval. Any military mission would be directed by NATO's commanding officer, always a United States general.
Historically, Washington wanted American troops directly involved in any NATO operation to cement Atlantic unity. It feared that if some military activities were left solely to the Europeans, Moscow and its Warsaw Pact allies would try to drive a wedge between Europe and the United States. This rejection of independent European decision-making led de Gaulle in 1966 to withdraw French forces from the NATO military command. Ever since, French governments have campaigned for a separate, purely European military force.
But Mr. Chirac has taken a different approach. The quarrel over European independence in cold-war strategy is now obsolete. Meanwhile, France risks falling behind in crucial new military technologies by prolonging its estrangement from NATO and the American military, the world leader in these areas.
Mr. Chirac also seeks a more economical approach to defense. He has announced plans to shift from France's large, conscription force to a smaller, modernized volunteer military.
By easing American opposition to European military action within NATO, the Clinton Administration has made it politically possible for Mr. Chirac to bring France back into the alliance's military structure. Washington and Paris still differ about what kind of activities European NATO members should undertake on their own. Washington has reason to worry that European allies might get in over their heads and then call on Washington to bail them out. But the basic decision-making and command structure has now been agreed on.
The new accord preserves Washington's insistence on unanimous decision-making and American command. It gives France added scope for European military action. In addition, it promises to bring French military forces back into NATO. The plan is not without risks and has yet to be tested. But it represents a constructive attempt to adapt NATO to post-cold-war realities.

Coca-Cola Enterprises Adds to Europe Stake

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, June 4

 BODY:
Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc., continuing to increase its share of the European market, said today that it would buy the British bottling operations co-owned by the Coca-Cola Company and Cadbury Schweppes P.L.C. for about $1.9 billion.
Coca-Cola Enterprises, which is owned 44 percent by Coca-Cola and is the world's largest bottler of that company's drinks, bought Coca-Cola's French and Belgian bottling operations for $915 million in May and has a three-year-old business in the Netherlands. Those operations plus the British bottling company, the nation's largest with a 23 percent market share, will account for 28 percent of Coca-Cola Enterprises' overall volume. "In those four, there are economies of scale," said Roy Burry, an analyst at Oppenheimer & Company. "You can raise their profit margins substantially." 
 On the New York Stock Exchange today, shares in Coca-Cola Enterprises rose $2.75, to $34.375, while Coca-Cola's shares rose 25 cents, to $46.50. The sale of the 10-year-old joint venture will defuse tensions that have been rising between Coca-Cola and Cadbury in the wake of Cadbury's purchase last year of the Dr Pepper/Seven-Up Companies. The acquisition made the British soda and candy maker a much stronger No. 3 in the United States, behind Coca-Cola and Pepsico Inc.
In recent months, Coca-Cola Enterprises had stopped bottling some Cadbury drinks in the United States and made overtures about buying the British bottling company.
The transaction will make Coca-Cola Enterprises the sole bottler for Cadbury and Coca-Cola soft drinks in Britain. The venture, Coca-Cola and Schweppes Beverages Ltd., had sales of 904 million, or $1.4 billion, and pretax profit of 111 million last year, which included one of Britain's hottest summers on record. Volume rose 11 percent.
Coca-Cola said the sale of its stake would raise $955 million, which it would use to reduce short-term debt. The sale, plus the proceeds from last month's sale of its French and Belgian bottlers, will result in a pretax gain of about $350 million in the third quarter, the company said.
For Cadbury, which is selling its stake for 620 million, or $960 million, the transaction frees up the cash it needs to pay for last year's purchase of Dr Pepper/Seven-Up. It said it would cancel an equity offering that was planned for the United States to raise 250 million.
Separately, Coca-Cola's main African bottling company said it would invest $100 million to build and improve factories in East Africa, part of the company's push to expand in Africa. Sabco, a Coca-Cola bottler in Johannesburg, will over the next five years build plants and service centers and purchase equipment in Mozambique, Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya, the company said.
Sabco is 84 percent owned by the Gutsche family of South Africa; Atlanta-based Coca-Cola owns the remaining 16 percent stake in the company, which bottles and distributes soft drinks.
Sabco owns and operates 16 bottling plants and 25 sales and distribution centers in East and South Africa.
In November, Coca-Cola formed a joint venture with Sabco, combining operations to cut costs and increase sales in the region and becoming one of Coca-Cola's so-called anchor bottlers, the company's cadre of primary bottling and distribution partners.

HEADLINE: Thomas Smith, 68, Ex-Jersey City Mayor, Dies

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

 BODY:
Thomas F. X. Smith, a former Mayor of Jersey City who helped revive the city's downtown area but lost in the Democratic primary when he made a bid for Governor in 1981, died on Friday at his home in Jersey City. He was 68.
The cause was cancer, said his daughter, Carol Smith. 
 Mr. Smith, who grew up in a cold-water flat near the Jersey City waterfront, was elected Mayor in 1977, after serving eight years as the city clerk. During his term, he wrote "The Powerticians," a history of Hudson County politics peppered with his own recollections.
Among his accomplishments as Mayor was the Montgomery Gateway Renewal Project, which created low-income housing in a blighted neighborhood between City Hall and the New Jersey Turnpike. One of the largest Federally subsidized projects ever undertaken in New Jersey, it helped bring about a resurgence of Jersey City's downtown area in the 1980's.
Known for his scrappiness, Mr. Smith once confronted President Jimmy Carter with demands for more urban aid, an encounter that inspired White House aides to call him "the mouth that roared." In another well-known incident, he threatened to shut off power and water to the Statue of Liberty if ferry service to Jersey City was dropped.
He also adopted a stray dog that he found wounded near the waterfront, naming it Henry Hudson and later casting it in a commercial for his gubernatorial campaign.
Mr. Smith left office in 1981 to run for Governor, hoping that the large number of former Hudson County residents spread around the state would insure his victory. He lost the Democratic primary and returned to the city clerk job, leaving in 1989. Most recently, he served as deputy executive director of the Hudson County Improvement Authority.
In 1983, he tried unsuccessfully for the position of Hudson County executive. He ran for Mayor again in 1989 but lost to Gerald McCann, who was later convicted of bank fraud and tax evasion.
The city administration was mired in a corruption scandal in Mr. Smith's first term as clerk, when Mayor Thomas J. Whelan and seven other officials were convicted of operating a multimillion-dollar kickback scheme. But Mr. Smith was not implicated in the scandal.
Mr. Smith graduated from St. Peter's College, where he studied English. He also received a master's degree in educational psychology from Fordham University. In the early 1960's, he served as director of placement at St. Peter's, helping college seniors find jobs. Later, for several years he was a vice president of Hudson County Community College.
A star basketball player at St. Peter's, Mr. Smith played briefly for the New York Knicks in 1951. While he was Mayor, he fought in an exhibition boxing match against Muhammed Ali in a benefit for Jersey City Medical Center. He was recognized by the St. Peter's Hall of Fame and the Hudson County Sports Hall of Fame.
Along with his daughter Carol, Mr. Smith is survived by another daughter, Regina Silver of Toms River, and two sisters, Florence Smith of Jersey City and Regina Quinn of Brick.

HEADLINE: The Nuclear End Run

BYLINE: By Paul Leventhal; Paul Leventhal is president of the Nuclear Control Institute.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The threat of nuclear terrorism is about to take a leap forward because of a deal now being worked out by Russia, France and Germany in which Russia will supply highly enriched bomb-grade uranium for use in research reactors. This is the kind of fuel used in the Hiroshima bomb.
The deal foils the goal of the recent nuclear-safety summit meeting in Moscow, held to improve controls over Russian nuclear materials. It is also a slap at the United States because it circumvents our embargo on exports of bomb-grade uranium. 
 The deal was prompted by Germany's decision to build a research reactor fueled with bomb-grade uranium. Since an international reactor-conversion program began in 1978, only Libya and China have broken the taboo against building such reactors. Germany is ignoring American findings that its reactor's design can be altered to use non-weapons-grade fuel.
Germany needs more than a ton of fuel. It approached Russia but pulled back after news disclosures. Scientists at the Technical University of Munich then arranged with France and Russia to avoid public scrutiny and the American embargo. Moscow would export uranium to France, ostensibly to meet its needs but actually to free up France's fuel of American origin for Germany.
Congress imposed the embargo on exports of the weapons-grade fuel in 1992 because research reactors now can be converted to run on low-enriched uranium, replacing bomb-grade fuel, which can easily be made into arms by terrorist states or groups.
Russia and France should know the danger. In 1990, Saddam Hussein used their bomb-grade uranium, imported with "peaceful" research reactors into Iraq, to build nuclear arms. The Kuwait war intervened and the uranium was recovered. But the main lesson -- the vulnerability of such exports to diversion -- has been lost on Russia and its two customers.
 The deal undermines the American-led efforts aimed at eliminating commerce in bomb-grade uranium. It is also at cross-purposes with our offer to pay Russia $12 billion to help prevent bomb-grade fuel from going elsewhere by diluting 500 tons of it into non-weapons-grade fuel for our power reactors.
 The United States refuses to use its leverage with Russia because the State Department wants to avoid frictions with Russia and Europe. This undermines President Clinton's policy of eliminating commerce in bomb-grade uranium. Compared with the $12 billion American deal, Russia's arrangement with Europe is peanuts.
If the United States fails to persuade Russia to pull back from its plans, the risks of nuclear theft in Europe will rise and less-reliable nations will be enticed to buy from Russia's stockpile.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE VICE PRESIDENT;
Taking Little for Granted, Gore Campaigns in Brooklyn

BYLINE: By IAN FISHER 

 BODY:
As his boss toured the halls of academia and privilege across the Hudson River, Vice President Al Gore went to the heart of Brooklyn yesterday, shaking hands with shoppers in the Fulton Mall and walking through a former crack house turned into a thriving day-care program.
The brief visit did not carry the frenzy of a full-blown campaign stop, but the purpose was clearly aimed at November. Even though President Clinton is far ahead in the polls in New York, Mr. Gore's visit seemed timed to dispel any notion that the Administration would take New York for granted, as several Democratic leaders here have grumbled recently. 
 Clinton strategists have acknowledged the importance of getting a high turnout among the Democrats' strongest constituencies. In New York, the black vote is especially crucial; the failure of black and other minority voters to turn out at the polls in large numbers in 1994 was a major reason Gov. Mario M. Cuomo lost his race for a fourth term.
Still, Mr. Gore played down the politics in a short news conference in the largely black neighborhood of Bedford-Stuyvesant, in front of the Bridge Street African Methodist Episcopal Church, which counts itself as the oldest black congregation in Brooklyn.
"I don't think politics really came up except in the most tangential way," Mr. Gore said after an hourlong meeting with 30 religious, educational and business leaders from the community. "I suppose there is no way to separate anything you do in an even-numbered year from politics, but that was not the principal purpose of my visit here.
"My principal purpose was to learn from the success stories that are emerging in this community."
Combined with the President's trip to New Jersey to receive an honorary degree from Princeton, Mr. Gore's visit seemed to assure a high degree of local news coverage of the two men and their campaign's early attention to the region. And the Vice President did not hesitate to take a swipe at Speaker Newt Gingrich and the Republicans' plans to revamp Medicare, saying they would cut benefits and strip some elderly people from the program.
The Vice President tartly responded to Republican complaints that the Administration had exaggerated the effects of their proposals.
"Speaker Gingrich talking about truth is a little bit like Dennis Rodman talking about hair care," Mr. Gore said, referring to the blonde-topped basketball player. "It's a little bit anomalous."
Mr. Gore began his day in New York at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel addressing the Hospitality Industry Investment Conference, a gathering of executives associated with tourism and conventions. He stumped there for what he called the Clinton Administration's successes in creating jobs, reducing unemployment and lowering interest rates -- all of which, he said, helped spur an upsurge in tourism and building of hotels and other related businesses.
In early afternoon, the Vice President traveled to Brooklyn, where he stopped for 15 minutes to shake hands on the bustling Fulton Mall, one of the borough's busiest shopping areas. In Bedford-Stuyvesant, he met leaders at the Bridge Street church, which traces its roots to 1766 and which President Clinton visited during the campaign four years ago, and toured an adjacent building that until four years ago was a crack house and brothel. With money raised by the church and businesses, and run with government money, the building is now home to the Bridge Street Head Start and serves 60 children.
Mr. Gore praised the initiative -- and several others the church has undertaken in the area to provide elderly housing and other community services -- as a model that called "into play the resources of state and local governments and private institutions in a partnership."

Excerpts From Address To Princeton Graduates

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from President Clinton's speech at Princeton University yesterday, as transcribed by the Federal News Service, a private transcription agency:
If we really want Americans, all Americans, to participate in the future that is now at your fingertips, we have got to increase the quality and the level of education not just for the graduates of Princeton and Georgetown and Yale and the state universities of this country, but for all the American people. It is the only way to achieve that goal. 
 The very fact that we have been here, or our forebears have, for 250 years is testimony to the elemental truth that education has always been important to individual Americans. And, for quite a long time, education has been quite important to our whole country. Fifty years ago, when the class of '46 was here, coming in after World War II, the G.I. Bill helped to build the great American middle class and a great American economy. But today, more than ever before in the history of the United States, education is the fault line, the great Continental Divide between those who will prosper and those who will not in the new economy. . . .
At the turn of the century, the progressives made it the law of the land for every child to be in school. Before then there was no such requirement. After World War II, we said 10 years are not enough; public schools should extend to 12 years.
And then, as I said, the G.I. Bill and college loans threw open the doors of college to the sons and daughters of farmers and factory workers, and they have powered our economy ever since.
America knows that higher education is the key to the growth we need to lift our country, and today that is more true than ever. Just listen to these facts. Over half the new jobs created in the last three years have been managerial and professional jobs. The new jobs require a higher level of skills. Fifteen years ago, the typical worker with a college degree made 38 percent more than a worker with a high school diploma. Today, that figure is 73 percent more.
Two years of college means a 20 percent increase in annual earnings. People who finish two years of college earn a quarter of a million dollars more than their high school counterparts over a lifetime.
Now, it is clear that America has the best higher-education system in the world and that it is the key to a successful future in the 21st century. It is also clear that because of costs and other factors, not all Americans have access to higher education. I want to say today that I believe the clear facts of this time make it imperative that our goal must be nothing less than to make the 13th and 14th years of education as universal to all Americans as the first 12 are today.
We have put in place an unprecedented college opportunity strategy. Student loans can now be given directly to people who need them. . . .
Now we want to go further. We want to expand work study so that a million students can work their way through college by the year 2000. We want to let people use money from their individual retirement accounts to help pay for college. We want every honor student in the top 5 percent of every high school class in America to get a $1,000 scholarship.
And we also want to do some other things that I believe we must do to make 14 years of education the standard for every American. First, I have asked Congress to pass a $10,000 tax deduction to help families pay for the cost of all education after high school, $10,000 a year.
Today, I announce one more element to complete our college strategy and make those two years of college as universal as four years of high school. A way to do it by giving families a tax credit targeted to achieve that goal. And making clear that this opportunity requires responsibility to receive it.
We should say to Americans who want to go to college, we will give you a tax credit to pay the cost of tuition at the average community college for your first year, or you can apply the same amount to the first year in a four-year university or college.
We will give you the exact same cut for the second year, but only if you earn it by getting a B average the first year. A tax deduction for families to help them pay for education after high school, a tax credit for individuals to guarantee their first year of college and second year if they earn it. . . .
Now, this program will do three things. It will open the doors of college opportunity to every American regardless of their ability to pay.
Education at the typical community college will now be free. And the very few states that have tuition above the amount that we can afford to credit, I would challenge those states to close the gap. We are going to take care of most of the states; the rest of them should help us the last little way.
Second, it will offer free tuition and training to every adult willing to work for it. Nobody now needs to be stuck in a dead-end job or in unemployment.
And finally, this plan will work because it will go to people who by definition are willing to work for it. It's America's most basic bargain. We'll help create opportunity if you'll take responsibility. This is the basic bargain that has made us a great nation.

HEADLINE: Harnessing the Sun And Selling It Abroad;
U.S. Solar Industry in Export Boom

BYLINE: By JULIE EDELSON HALPERT 

 BODY:
Jolted by the oil embargoes of the 1970's, the Federal Government has been awarding research grants to develop solar power ever since. Twenty years and $1.4 billion in taxpayer money later, solar power is still not much more than a dim light bulb in the nation's energy constellation.
But the investment is paying off anyway -- in a thriving export business that is proving, as solar proponents insisted all along, that "small is beautiful." 
 From India and Indonesia to Mexico and Brazil, solar panels made in America are sprouting on thousands of rooftops, lighting up jungles, deserts and other hard-to-wire areas of the developing world that have never been connected to conventional power grids -- and are not likely to be any time soon. The panels are also bringing communication links, powering up cellular phones as a wireless substitute for an installed infrastructure.
Mostly, these solar investments are indeed small, at $400 to $600 a house. But they add up quickly because the projects can encompass whole villages at a time. What's more, in areas that have transmission grids, huge solar plants are being designed by American companies to provide supplemental power to thousands of homes at a time, and without adding to pollution.
All this means big business at last for the dozens of small and mid-sized companies that make solar equipment in the United States. The companies, including Astro Power, Solec International and Solarex, are pulling in $300 million a year, or 30 percent of the worldwide market, making the United States the biggest center of solar manufacturing, eclipsing Japan, Britain, Italy and other major players.
To meet the growing demand -- the Energy Department predicts global sales will jump by 70 percent over the next five years -- companies here are adding plants and workers in a mad scramble that is expected to double their manufacturing capacity by the end of next year, from 1995 levels. They now export 70 percent of their products, up from 50 percent three years ago.
"It's a bullish market and there's a lot of money to be made," said Christine Ervin, who runs the Energy Department's renewable energy program.
The export market is strong enough now that it is drawing the interest of American utilities, which see solar demand abroad as a new source of revenue, with them serving as suppliers and consultants.
And as manufacturing costs continue to come down, some energy experts expect solar power to show new signs of life even at home.
The cost to the consumer has already been cut in half in the last 10 years, the experts say, with the typical residential installation in the United States now running between $18,000 and $20,000. When the price gets down to about $6,000, the initial outlay and financing expenses will become competitive with the monthly cost of traditional sources of power, according to Lisa Frantzis, a senior consultant for renewable energy technologies at Arthur D. Little in Cambridge, Mass. That could happen in about 10 years, she added.
To be sure, no one expects solar to fully replace any mainstream source of power in the United States -- for one thing, there just isn't enough sun to go around in many parts of the country. Solar now accounts for less than one tenth of 1 percent of energy use nationally. And if all the solar panels made last year in American factories were somehow wired together, they would produce just 35 megawatts of power, only enough to meet the needs of a community of 35,000 people.
Still, with the growing interest worldwide, the activity here is getting feverish.
"We have more demand than we can handle," said Allen Barnett, president of Astro Power Inc. Based in Newark, Del., the company was a tiny start-up 10 years ago. Now it has 145 employees and annual revenues exceeding $10 million, 80 percent from exports.
What is driving the solar boom is the sheer size of the potential foreign market: about one-third of the world's population, or two billion people, live without electricity.
Interest in solar energy has surged because of the growing realization that this huge gap can not be closed with conventional power sources, said Charles Feinstein, a senior environmental specialist at the World Bank.
Diesel generators, once considered the leading contender, often break down and fuel supplies are limited. Many people rely instead on smoky kerosene lamps or car batteries that frequently need recharging.
Power from the sun, an abundant resource in much of the developing world, is an attractive alternative because one solar panel installed on a house can power two light bulbs, a television and a radio. The panels contain photovoltaic "cells," made from semiconductor materials, that convert light to electricity.
"While the electric company would need to arrive with a lot of equipment, our company can arrive on a motorcycle or a donkey with a solar panel and other components very easily," said Ramon Soto, who runs an energy services company in the Dominican Republic. What's more, a solar system is virtually maintenance free.
These days, India is the biggest foreign market, having committed $400 million to solar power over a five-year period ending in 1997. In addition, the World Bank is providing $55 million in loans to bring solar power to 50,000 homes and many commercial buildings in the country.
Harish H. Hande, who manages the Solar Electric Light Company in Mangalore, India, says up to 40 percent of the people in rural areas have the means to buy the $500 systems themselves. That is a potential market of 240 million people, "a huge number, equal to the population of Europe," Mr. Hande said.
Other big foreign markets are Mexico, Kenya, Indonesia and Brazil. Those with big potential are China, Vietnam and South Africa, industry experts say.
In cranking up their export production, solar companies in the United States are hoping to achieve new economies of scale to drive prices down significantly. The panels they make, which range in size from less than 1 watt of generating capacity to 300 or more watts, now cost about $4.50 a watt at the retail level.
Stan Ovshinsky, president and chief executive of Energy Conversion Devices, has developed a manufacturing process at his new factory in Troy, Mich., that he said could send the price for his panels down to $1 a watt in three years.
That price "will drive explosive demand, not just in the developing world, but everywhere," said Eric Ingersoll, a managing partner with Environmental Advantage, a consulting firm in New York that studies the renewable-energy industries.
The existing demand has not exactly been lackluster.
Solec International Inc., the country's third-largest solar manufacturer, has more than doubled its work force, to 130, over the last three years.
"We don't even advertise and people visit us every day from foreign countries," said Joel Davidson, director of systems engineering for the company, which is based in Hawthorne, Calif., and is controlled by two large Japanese shareholders, the Sanyo Electric Company and the Sumitomo Corporation. Like Astro Power, Solec's revenues last year exceeded $10 million, and Mr. Davidson expects they will increase by 30 percent this year, with much of the gain coming from India.
The world's largest solar company is Siemens Solar, owned by the German company Siemens A.G. but with much of its operation in the United States. It produces half of this country's panel supply, exporting 70 percent of the output from its factories in Camarillo, Calif., and Vancouver, Wash.
Some of the larger manufacturers are planning enormous full-scale solar plants. The largest American-owned player is Solarex, a joint venture of two conventional energy giants -- the Amoco Corporation and the Enron Corporation. Solarex has set its sights on becoming the world's fastest-growing solar company by proposing full-scale plants. In the planning stages is a $100 million, 50-megawatt plant in Rajasthan, India, that could power 200,000 homes.
"There will be a big field in the desert full of these modules," the industry term for solar panels, said Bob Kelly, chief executive of Amoco/ Enron Solar Power Development, the sister company of Solarex that handles marketing.
Solarex is scheduled to open a $25 million factory outside Williamsburg, Va., next year and, by 1999, triple its capacity in its existing factory in Frederick, Md., where the company is based.
Tom Cross, director of First National Battery in Johannesburg, said his company had already spent $1.5 million this year on Solarex panels for rural electrification. "It's quite remarkable the rate at which U.S. companies are coming in," he said.
As domestic companies invest to meet foreign demand, niche applications of solar power are growing at home.
One domestic showcase will be at the Olympics this summer in Atlanta, where the swimming and diving competitions will be held under the world's largest solar rooftop, which will provide power for the 10,000-seat arena. Solarex is supplying the panels for the $6 million project.
More typically, though, solar is used to avoid digging up the ground to install electrical lines. It now powers everything from billboards and highway emergency phones to homes far from the electric grid.
As utilities gear up for a big solar role abroad, they are using their domestic markets to gain experience. Southern California Edison, a unit of SCEcorp for example, has a local program that allows residents without conventional electricity to pay the $500 up-front cost plus a monthly charge to have the company install a solar system. At the end of 15 years, the customer owns the system outright.
With all the new demand, solar companies are trying not to overestimate the surge in their market. While in an expansion mode, Solarex, for one, is being cautious, said its president, Harvey Forest.
"We don't want projects," he said, "that will be here today and gone tomorrow."

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE PRESIDENT;
CLINTON PROPOSES U.S. TAX CREDITS FOR COLLEGE AID

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: PRINCETON, N.J., June 4

 BODY:
Proclaiming higher education the linchpin of economic progress, President Clinton came to one of the most costly colleges in the nation today to propose a new $1,500 tax credit aimed at making the first two years of college as commonplace for Americans as high school already is.
With Senator Bob Dole and other Republicans weighing proposals for an across-the-board tax cut of up to 15 percent, Mr. Clinton used a commencement address at Princeton University to argue once again for smaller, more targeted relief to help finance post-secondary education into the next century. 
 "I believe the clear facts of this time make it imperative that our goal must be nothing less than to make the 13th and 14th years of education as universal to all Americans as the first 12 are today," Mr. Clinton told graduates. [Excerpts from Mr. Clinton's address, page B6.]
Mr. Clinton's proposal had been under consideration for months but was sped up in recent days to beat Republicans to the tax-cutting punch, and was finished only Monday night. The plan -- which would supplement the President's longstanding proposal for a $10,000 annual tax deduction for college or vocational education, an idea that has languished in the Republican-controlled Congress for 18 months -- would require Congressional approval.
Under the plan announced today, families earning up to $100,000 a year could choose either a single $10,000 deduction for the whole family or a direct $1,500 tax credit for each eligible child, available in the form of a rebate even to those whose taxes are already paid.
The Administration chose $1,500 because it is slightly above the average nationwide tuition for community colleges, but the money could be applied for any college, public or private, including Princeton, where it would cover just 5 percent of the estimated total annual cost of $29,400.
White House aides noted that the credit would be more helpful to the typical middle-class family than the earlier proposal for a tax deduction, which would disproportionately help those at higher income levels who itemize deductions.
The program would add about $8 billion to the estimated $35 billion cost of the tax deduction over the next six years. Mr. Clinton would finance it through various means: by partly closing a tax loophole on exports by multinational corporations that do business in the United States, by auctioning off radio frequencies for wireless services like paging and home banking, and by increasing the international airline departure tax by $10, to $16 per passenger.
In proposing a new tax break for education even before his previous proposal has made any legislative progress, the President showed both the limits of his power and the popular appeal of the idea. Indeed, when Mr. Dole faulted Mr. Clinton today for the revenue increases that would be used to pay for the program, the White House swiftly distributed a transcript of a statement by Mr. Dole in February praising the President's idea for tax credits.
The transcript shows that while campaigning in Iowa on Feb. 3, Mr. Dole recalled Congressional talks with the White House over balancing the budget, and said, "I must say, on the junior college level, community college level, in this, in all these 50 hours of talks we talked about, President Clinton had an idea that was pretty good, and that was credits for two-year college students."
Any student would be eligible for the credit for one year; to retain it for the second, he or she would have to maintain a B average and stay off drugs, defined as having no felony drug convictions.
Mr. Clinton modeled the program, which he called "Hope Scholarships," on a program of the same name developed by Gov. Zell Miller of Georgia. Mr. Miller came with him today to promote his idea, which guarantees free public college tuition to any student in the state with a B average.
"It's America's most basic bargain," Mr. Clinton told the graduates. "We'll help create opportunity if you'll take responsibility. That is the basic bargain that has made us a great nation."
The university's 249th commencement took place in front of Nassau Hall, the main campus building, which served briefly as the Capitol of the newly independent United States in 1783. Mr. Clinton became the third American President to address a major Princeton ceremony in the last century, and the 18th to receive an honorary degree, but the first sitting President ever to address a commencement here.
Grover Cleveland spoke at a university convocation 100 years ago, and Harry Truman did so in 1947, for the university's bicentennial.
On the university's 150th anniversary in 1896, Woodrow Wilson, then a professor, delivered an address titled "Princeton in the Nation's Service," which has since become the university's informal motto, and Mr. Clinton harked back to that theme.
"In 1996, like 1896, we really do stand at the dawn of a profoundly new era," Mr. Clinton said. "I have called it the Age of Possibility because of the revolution in information and technology and market capitalism sweeping the globe -- a world no longer divided by the Cold War. Just consider this: there's more computer power in a Ford Taurus every one of you can buy and drive to the supermarket than there was in Apollo 11 when Neil Armstrong took it to the moon."
Mr. Clinton said that expanding access to higher education would benefit not only the students who receive it, but society as a whole.
"So I ask you never to be satisfied with an age of probability for only the sons and daughters of Princeton," Mr. Clinton said. "You could go your own way in a society that, after all, seems so often to be coming apart instead of coming together. You will, of course, have the ability to succeed in the global economy, even if you have to secede from those Americans trapped in the old economy. But you should not walk away from our common purpose."

HEADLINE: Massachusetts Senate Candidates Debate Again

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY

DATELINE: BOSTON, June 4

 BODY:
In the second public debate of their Senate campaign, Senator John Kerry and Governor William F. Weld engaged in some caustic exchanges here Monday night over who would better champion the interests of working-class families in Massachusetts.
Echoing some of the same themes that dominated their first meeting in April, Mr. Kerry, the Democratic incumbent, said he supported an increase in the minimum wage. In turn, Mr. Weld, the Republican challenger, argued that an earned-income tax credit would benefit more people. 
 Mr. Kerry accused Mr. Weld of supporting cuts in a raft of Federal social programs; Mr. Weld contended that Mr. Kerry had jeopardized the future by voting against the Republicans' proposed balanced budget amendment.
And in closing, the men used almost the same words: Mr. Weld said the election was about "who can better represent the interest of working families," and Mr. Kerry asked, "Who is going to stand up and really fight for, not just talk about, the working people of this state?"
In polls of registered voters, Mr. Kerry is holding a narrow but steady lead. Democrats outnumber Republicans by about 3 to 1 in the state, where polls also show President Clinton leading Bob Dole, the Republicans' likely Presidential nominee.
The debate was held in a Boston television station, with a small audience of invited guests.
The campaign has generated unusual interest because of the broad popularity of both candidates inside Massachusetts and their reputations as party nonconformists.
Yet in projecting their moderate views, some contrary to their national party leadership, Mr. Kerry and Mr. Weld seemed at times to collide in the middle -- even crossing traditional party lines on occasion -- as they fought for the roughly 20 percent of Massachusetts voters who are undecided or independent.
Mr. Kerry, who is seeking a third term, took a sharply un-liberal position when he answered one question by saying that he supported affirmative action but that "I'm not in favor of quotas; I never have been." And Mr. Weld hardly sounded the conservative in responding to the same question: "The unemployment rate nationwide is twice as high for blacks as it is for whites. Now you ask yourself, are we at the stage where we have a race-blind, gender-blind society?"
But by blurring party lines neither candidate seemed to give voters much of a reason to change their current sentiments.
While the candidates clashed over Medicare and social welfare policy, not a word was uttered about the recent election in Israel, the coming election in Russia or any other foreign policy matter.
In the end, political analysts said neither man seemed to have landed any knockout blows. "No blood; no win," Lou DiNatale, a political analyst at the University of Massachusetts at Boston, said today, assessing Mr. Weld's effectiveness in the hourlong debate. "If I'm Senator Kerry this morning, I feel O.K."

HEADLINE: Wife of Jailed Nigerian Opposition Leader Is Slain

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: LAGOS, Nigeria, June 4

 BODY:
A wife of the wealthy Nigerian businessman who is widely believed to have won a 1993 presidential election was shot and killed today.
The wife, Kudirat Abiola, a 44-year-old businesswoman, was shot, as was her driver, as they rode along a street in Lagos. Three men in a car attacked her car, witnesses said. 
 Mrs. Abiola had been campaigning for the release of her husband, Mashood, who declared himself president on the first anniversary of the 1993 election, which was annulled by the Government. Mr. Abiola, who has several other wives, was arrested shortly afterward and has been held ever since on treason charges.
Mrs. Abiola's brother-in-law, Mubashiru Abiola, speaking for the family, said that Mrs. Abiola's driver had also died. He said her personal assistant, who was also in the car, was not hurt and had been detained by the police.
The attack by the unknown assailants was immediately condemned by the United States and by civil rights groups in Nigeria, which has been shunned by much of the world for rights abuses.
"This is a very bad omen for the nation," said Shina Loremikan, a spokesman for an umbrella group called Campaign for Democracy.
The United States, which has repeatedly criticized the Nigerian Government for its treatment of Mr. Abiola and other political figures and has imposed a series of economic sanctions, said it deplored the murder and called on Nigeria to catch and prosecute the killers.
A State Department spokesman, Glyn Davies, said it was too soon to tell whether the killing was politically motivated, "but it does appear to have been an assassination, not an intended robbery."
The police promised a full investigation. "No stone will be left unturned in unraveling the perpetrators of this heinous crime," said a statement read on state television.
Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation with about 100 million people, has been in crisis since the June 1993 presidential election deemed to have been won by Mr. Abiola. It was annulled by the military Government in power at that time.
In November 1995, Ken Saro-Wiwa, a human rights activist and writer, and eight members of his Movement for the Survival of Ogoni Peoples were hanged for the murder of four Ogoni chiefs.

Times Square Theater to Move
To make way for the latest addition to the updated Times Square -- a 25-screen movie complex -- a developer plans to literally pick up a historic 42d Street burlesque house and move it 70 feet down the street. The plan involves moving the facade and interior of the 93-year-old Empire Theater, on the south side of 42d Street between 7th and 8th Avenue. [A1.]
 
Beating Victim Found in Park
A woman was found badly beaten and unconscious in a wooded area of Central Park after an attack that apparently took place in broad daylight. The victim, believed to be in her 20's, was discovered by a woman walking her dog near West 81st Street. [Page B1.]
 
Divisions of Political Power
Blacks make up 54 percent of the population in Mount Vernon, N.Y., and that has meant political power. The Mayor and four of the five City Council members are black. But blacks have never constituted a majority on Mount Vernon's school board, in a district where 77 percent of students are black and 9 percent are Hispanic. Black candidates sum up their defeat in four words: the Italian Civic Association. [B1.]
 
Albany Feud Gains Steam
Governor Pataki said that he was "too busy running the state" to worry about charges by Lieut. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross that his aides had mounted a McCarthyite smear campaign to discredit her. Yet even as Mr. Pataki was playing down his growing rift with Ms. McCaughey Ross, one of his top aides, Bernadette Castro, was conducting a surprise attack on a radio call-in show. [B1.]
 
A Day Off (at Least for Some)
It's Thursday of the week after Memorial Day, otherwise known -- to the extent that anyone knows about it -- as Brooklyn-Queens Day. The State Legislature decreed it a holiday in 1905 to commemorate the founding of the Brooklyn Sunday School Union, closing the schools to allow children to parade through the streets of Brooklyn (and Queens, in 1959) in celebration of their Protestant traditions. In the Bronx, Manhattan and Staten Island, it's just another school day. About New York by David Gonzalez. [B1.]
 
Van in Crash Was Run Illegally
The company operating a crowded van that overturned on a Queens highway, killing two people, had lost its license to transport passengers and was operating illegally, officials said. The driver of the van, who had fled after the crash, surrendered to face manslaughter charges. It was not clear whether City Express of Brooklyn had obtained a new insurer. [B3.]
 
Court Rejects Pesticide Law
A Nassau County law regulating the spraying of pesticides, the first law passed by the county's new legislature, has been thrown out by a state judge, who ruled that the legislature had exceeded its authority. [B5.]
 
NEW JERSEY
 
Clinton Speaks at Princeton
Proclaiming higher education the linchpin of economic progress, President Clinton used a commencement address at Princeton University to propose a new $1,500 tax credit aimed at making the first two years of college as commonplace as high school already is. [A1.]
 
Vice President Al Gore visited Brooklyn, shaking hands with shoppers on the Fulton Mall and walking through a former crack house turned into a day care program. [B6.]
 
Princeton broke a graduation-day tradition as old as the college itself: the president who gave the speech in front of Nassau Hall was not the president of Princeton, but the President of the United States. [B10.]
 
U.S. Senate Race Narrows to 2
The race to fill the United States Senate seat being vacated by Bill Bradley narrowed to two contenders, as Dick Zimmer, a three-term Congressman from Delaware Township, easily won the Republican nomination. He will face Robert G. Torricelli, a seven-term House member who ran unopposed in the New Jersey primary. [A1.]
 
Judge Resigns Over Attacks
A Federal appellate judge has added his voice to the stinging political oratory over the independence of the Federal judiciary. The judge, H. Lee Sarokin, who had been singled out by Bob Dole as too liberal, resigned from the bench, saying that partisan political attacks on judges are undermining their ability to make independent decisions. [B1.]
 
Court Rules in Blood Suit
New Jersey's Supreme Court ruled that the organization that oversees the safety of the nation's blood supply was negligent in the early 1980's when it rejected tougher screening tests for AIDS contamination in donated blood. [B2.]
 
Ex-Official Acquitted in Fraud
A Federal jury in Manhattan acquitted Nicholas A. Rudi, a former official of Camden County, N.J., of charges that he was paid kickbacks for steering municipal bond business to a New Jersey bank. [B2.]

HEADLINE: A Mount Vernon Civics Quiz;
Are Schools About Jobs, Contracts or Education?

BYLINE: By MONTE WILLIAMS 

DATELINE: MOUNT VERNON, N.Y., June 4

 BODY:
Blacks make up 54 percent of the population here, and that has meant political power. The Mayor, Ernest D. Davis, is black. And four of the five City Council members are black.
The school system is another story -- one of ethnic politics reminiscent of a bygone era that has kept whites in control of a district where 77 percent of students are black and 9 percent are Hispanic. 
 Blacks have never constituted a majority on Mount Vernon's school board. And substantial gains in the last few years were eroded with last month's school board election, which will change the racial makeup of the nine-member board from five whites and four blacks to seven whites and two blacks.
Black candidates sum up their defeat in four words: the Italian Civic Association. A nonpartisan group that does not get involved in other municipal races, the Italian Civic Association has long dominated school board elections here. Critics say jobs and power, not education, motivate the organization, a charge the association vehemently denies.
Many I.C.A. members are employees of the school district, among them Schools Superintendent William C. Prattella. With 24 years on the job, he is the longest-serving superintendent in Westchester County. Responding to questions about his membership in the group, he said, "I'm not going to walk away from my heritage, and I wouldn't expect anyone else to walk away from theirs."
Another association member, Elia DeBenedictis, 53, supervises school board elections as clerk of the board -- a sore point for blacks who hope to remove elections from his purview.
Founded in 1917, the I.C.A. elected its first school board trustee in 1919. Its members, all of whom trace their roots to Italy, prod people to vote by phoning and making house calls, said its president, John Jones, whose mother is Italian-American. "We've been totally involved in school politics better than 50 years," he said. "It's been good for us."
Many blacks say too good. The Board of Education is Mount Vernon's largest employer, and the school budget, at $94 million, is about double that of the municipal budget.
"What drives the white community to want to control the school system is not the education of children," charged the Rev. W. Franklyn Richardson, who founded a political group called the Coalition for the Empowerment of People of African Ancestry four years ago to oppose the I.C.A. "They get their children educated elsewhere. What makes people get up out of hospitals on crutches and vote is jobs, contracts and the leverage derived from those things. Because that is the motivation, they are not as concerned about the quality of education."
Anthony Mosca, an I.C.A. member just elected to the school board, derides such talk. "Voting is the civic thing to do," said Mr. Mosca, a former Westchester County police commissioner. "We want to make the schools better and attract young people with children to the city, to build up the economic base, and maybe, just maybe, turn this city around."
But critics question the group's endorsement record. In its 79-year history, the association has backed only one black candidate, although it sometimes supports whites not of Italian descent. "Blacks haven't put in any resumes to be considered," said Mr. Jones, a Mount Vernon police officer. "Is that my fault?"
Similarly, the Coalition for the Empowerment of People of African Ancestry has endorsed no whites, and it offers no apologies. "We are trying to overcome an imbalance," said Mr. Richardson, pastor of the Grace Baptist Church here. "We are not on a level playing field."
Mr. Jones scoffs at the coalition's talk of equality. Inclusion, he said, is not what it wants. "Their name says it all: 'Coalition for the Empowerment.' They want total control, and they can't have total control because Mount Vernon has a lot of people of different backgrounds."
In this city of 67,000, which has the lowest median household income in Westchester County, about one-third of the electorate voted in the recent election, the largest turnout in three years. If the outcome had been different, blacks would have been a majority on the board for the first time. Voting was largely split along racial lines, and coalition candidates say that whites voted to preserve a patronage system that has served them well. Carol Ben-Reuben, a black school board member who lost her bid for re-election, said she was dismissed as a divisive radical by her opponents after she pushed for the hiring of blacks, including contractors and vendors.
But Dr. Prattella, the Superintendent, said that the district was second highest in the county in the employment of minorities. About 26 percent of the teaching staff, 30 percent of the administration and at least 35 percent of clerical, custodial and support staff are black, he said. "People say, 'But the school system is 86 percent minority, so the district should reflect that,' but that doesn't happen overnight," he said.
Ms. Ben-Reuben disputed the Superintendent's data on minority hiring and charged that the district often hired politically connected contractors who often charged more than their original bids. William Martimucci, a board member who is an I.C.A. member, dismissed Ms. Ben-Reuben's allegations as "sour grapes" and declined further comment.
Local television and the town newspaper, however, have chronicled problems: computers that were lost, then found months later; private, for-profit dance classes that were held in four elementary schools; an unauthorized full-day kindergarten that was offered at a predominantly white school but not at most predominantly black schools.
State Comptroller H. Carl McCall is auditing the district's books, although a spokeswoman for his office would not say why. Coalition candidates are also challenging the results of the recent election.
A representative of the Justice Department monitored the counting of paper ballots after the election, but a spokesman for the United States Attorney would neither confirm nor deny an investigation.
Blacks, including the school board's president, Kenneth Sylvester, have also called on the State Department of Education to appoint an impartial body to administer future elections. "Because the I.C.A. has been a powerhouse in school board elections for two decades," Mr. Sylvester said, "and the clerk of the board as well as other people running the elections are, for the most part, I.C.A. members, members of the community have a deep feeling that they can never have a fair election."
Mr. DeBenedictis bristles at the suggestion of improprieties or the idea that elections should be administered by someone else. "Maybe I shouldn't be Italo-American," he said. "I stand on the integrity of this office."
Dr. Prattella said the reason coalition candidates lost had nothing to do with voting irregularities. "They had nothing good to say about the district," he said.
The coalition has called for Dr. Prattella's removal from his $114,000-a-year post, asserting that he presides over a failing system.
Dr. Prattella disagrees, pointing out that last year a higher percentage of Mount Vernon elementary-school children passed standardized tests that measure basic reading, writing and math skills than did students in Westchester public schools as a whole and in medium-sized cities throughout the state.
For example, on a reading exam, 93.1 percent of Mount Vernon's sixth graders scored above the minimum competency level, compared with 89.9 percent of all Westchester sixth graders. Children passed in great numbers in both middle-class and poor sections of the city. "We believe that students from all backgrounds -- disadvantaged or advantaged -- can learn," Dr. Prattella said. "The results speak for themselves."
But he has had less success at Mount Vernon High School. In the first marking period of this school year, 65 percent of students failed at least one subject. Dr. Prattella said a program to increase attendance and shore up academic performance would be adopted.
Black candidates say proof the administration has little concern for black children can be found in the condition of schools that are virtually all black and those attended by a significant number of whites.
The student body at Pennington-Grimes Elementary School is 55 percent white, a larger percentage of whites than any other Mount Vernon school. On a lush verdant campus, the imposing brick structure could easily be in one of Westchester's wealthiest corners.
The place is impossibly clean. It is also awash in color. Blue and orange terra cotta tiles line the lobby, where gold fish swim in brightly lighted tanks. The gym is covered in "an experimental carpet that gives you the same bounce as a floor," Dr. Prattella explained.
Recent visits to Washington, Parker and Williams elementary schools, which have no white students, showed the disparity that has prompted complaints. Washington is the most dismal. Compared with Pennington, it is a gray dungeon. The walls are largely unadorned, the paint chipped in many places. Door windows are dirty, the floors old and scuffed.
Small pools of water settle on the floor of the makeshift lunchroom, the result of a drainage problem. Padding on pipes designed to protect children in play areas is crumbling. The lines on the gymnasium basketball court are so faded they can barely be discerned.
These conditions are striking because Washington is a magnet school that receives $2 million a year in state funds to attract white students, part of the city's integration plan.
Asked to explain the disparities, Dr. Prattella first said he did not understand the question and then denied there were disparities but eventually conceded that some custodians were better than others.
Lynn McBride, a black board member who lost her bid for re-election, had no trouble seeing the disparities nor offering an explanation. While all schools are allotted the same amount of money per pupil, $9,383.45, money for the upkeep of buildings, she said, is not distributed equally. "Some schools," she said, "were allowed to deteriorate."

HEADLINE: Sunflower Seeds Replace Ukraine's Old Missile Sites

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: KIEV, Ukraine, June 4

 BODY:
Ukraine officially completed its nuclear disarmament today with a scattering of sunflower seeds by the top defense officials of the United States, Russia and Ukraine.
The ceremony at the Pervomaisk base, where more than 80 underground silos housed SS-19 missiles aimed at the United States, marked the end of a three-year process under which Ukraine gave up the nuclear arsenal it inherited from the Soviet Union. On Saturday the last of 1,900 strategic nuclear warheads were loaded on a train and sent to Russia for destruction. 
 Defense Secretary William J. Perry, who has coaxed Ukraine's disarmament along by frequent visits here -- today was his fourth inspection of Pervomaisk -- said sunflowers instead of missiles in the soil would insure peace for future generations.
He was joined by Defense Ministers Pavel Grachev of Russia and Valery Shmarov of Ukraine. Six months ago, in the same place, the three set off a blast that demolished a concrete silo housing a six-warhead SS-19 missile. Since then, a number of the silos have been blown up and filled with soil.
The dismantling of Ukraine's nuclear weapons has been at the heart of Washington's policy to try to consolidate Ukraine as an independent nation that serves as a buffer between Russia and the rest of Europe.
In a statement on Saturday, President Clinton congratulated Ukraine on completing its nuclear disarmament and thus reducing the worldwide nuclear threat.
With the economic reforms stalled by political hesitation and widespread corruption, the dismantling of the nuclear hardware has been far more efficient. The Clinton Administration's defense officials have nurtured the disarmament process with plentiful financing.
American officials said today's ceremony marked further implementation of a agreement signed in Moscow in January 1994 by President Clinton, President Boris N. Yeltsin and Leonid Kravchuk, then the Ukrainian President.
Under the terms of this agreement, Ukraine formally acceded to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty as a nonnuclear-weapon state. In return, Washington pledged about $400 million to help dismantle the missiles and turn missile bases into areas for civilian use, like agriculture. The area at Pervomaisk, 180 miles south of Kiev, the capital, is being returned to wheat and sunflower fields.
American military contractors have been involved in draining fuel from the missiles and in destroying the concrete silos. American money has been used for building housing for the demobilized military officers who served in Ukraine's strategic rocket forces.
Russia agreed to accept Ukraine's warheads and destroy them. As compensation for the value of the highly enriched uranium in the warheads, Russia has been sending Ukraine fuel rods for the nation's civilian nuclear power plants.
Two other former Soviet republics, Belarus and Kazakstan, have also agreed to be free of nuclear weapons. Kazakstan got rid of the last of its nuclear weapons last year and Belarus is in the final stages of dismantlement, American officials said.

HEADLINE: PESO TRAIL -- A special report.;
A Mexican Mover and Shaker Got the Red Carpet at Citibank

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA with PETER TRUELL 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, June 4

 BODY:
The instructions from Citibank's New York headquarters to clerks at the bank's Mexico City office were clear: Ask no questions.
Every few weeks throughout 1993, a mysterious courier made his way to the 16th floor of Citibank's glass-walled headquarters in Mexico City, carrying a cashier's check in pesos with a value of $3 million to $5 million. The clerks accepted the checks, which were made out to a Citibank subsidiary, and converted the proceeds to dollars. Then the money was wired to Citibank in New York, which sent it to accounts in Switzerland. No questions asked. 
 Although no one in Citibank's Mexico City office knew it, the client who relied on these methods to whisk more than $80 million out of the country was Raul Salinas de Gortari, the eldest brother of Carlos Salinas de Gortari, then President of Mexico. The transactions, described by Mexican investigators and others familiar with them, are the heart of an unfolding inquiry that spans two continents and nine countries.
After saying earlier this year that Citibank was neither a subject nor a target of a Federal inquiry, the Justice Department said for the first time this week that it had opened a criminal investigation of Mr. Salinas's transactions. Carl Stern, the Department's chief spokesman, said the aim is to determine if Citibank or any others violated American laws, which prohibit banks from knowingly helping criminals hide illicit earnings.
A Citibank spokesman, Richard J. Howe, said today that the bank is cooperating with all of the investigations into Mr. Salinas's money. Citibank's own inquiry, Mr. Howe said, found "no evidence of violation of the laws by the bank or any of its employees."
Mr. Salinas, 49, is in a maximum-security prison in Mexico and has been charged with financial wrongdoing and masterminding a rival's murder.
He told Swiss investigators that in 1989, shortly after his brother took office, he opened bank accounts overseas under false names "to avoid political scandal," according to a transcript of his December 1995 interrogation made available to The New York Times.
But that was before he found his way into the secretive world of private banking, in which "relationship managers" at American and European banks cater to wealthy clients who demand both discretion and personal attention.
Once Mr. Salinas entered this exclusive world in 1993, he told the Swiss investigators, Citibank officers in New York "came up with a whole strategy" in which he did not need aliases. Instead, money was transferred to European banks and deposited under the names of untraceable Cayman Islands shell corporations set up for Mr. Salinas with Citibank's help.
His manager, Amy G. Elliott, handled every detail, he said, shifting the money from country to country in search of the best interest rates. Months after he was jailed on murder charges, Mrs. Elliott was still advising his wife on how to consolidate the family's millions in a trust account in Europe.
It remains unclear how Mr. Salinas, who as one of Mexico's best-paid civil servants never officially earned more than $190,000 a year, amassed so much money so quickly. Mexican authorities have charged that his holdings, which could exceed $200 million, stemmed from some form of illegal activity, though they have not specified what. They also said Mr. Salinas may have maintained accounts in more than two dozen American banks.
Swiss officials are weighing whether his deposits in their country should be confiscated. Initially, American officials suspected that the money was linked to drug trafficking, but no evidence has surfaced. "It is not corrupt money," Mr. Salinas declared in his Swiss deposition.
Mr. Salinas said the money came from a mix of loans, advances and legitimate business deals, but Mexican prosecutors say he has not provided any evidence that such deals ever existed.
American laws prohibit banks from knowingly accepting or turning a blind eye to deposits that stem from crimes such as drug dealing.
Citibank and most other banks require officers to make a serious effort to find out about new customers and the source of their money.
In the case of Mr. Salinas, Citibank had a client with a conspicuous taste for high living and a reputation even among ordinary Mexicans as a shady operator with unexplained wealth.
"How could anyone named Salinas using his own name deposit millions of dollars without questions being raised?" asked Ronald K. Noble, a former American Under Secretary of the Treasury who heads an international task force on money laundering.
Mrs. Elliott and her lawyer declined to comment. Neither would say what steps she took to assess Mr. Salinas's fortune or to insure that its sources were legitimate.
The Citibank spokesman, Mr. Howe, said Mrs. Elliott "continues to be an employee in good standing." Asked if senior officials were aware of Mr. Salinas's accounts in the three years he was Citibank's client, Mr. Howe would say only that "corporate management had no involvement in the opening or managing of this account in any way."
There is a larger theme, too, in the relationship between Mr. Salinas and Citibank. In Mexico and elsewhere in the region, the preference of the rich to bank their millions of dollars overseas hurts local economies and currencies by draining badly needed capital. That, in turn, raises the cost of imported goods for consumers. Interest rates rise and governments pay more to borrow, sometimes from the same banks that helped move the private fortunes out of the country. Less is left for social programs, and the rich have become richer at the expense of the poor and the middle class.
 
The Sexenio
A Six-Year Cycle Of Money and Power
The six-year administration -- sexenio in Mexico -- of Carlos Salinas de Gortari got off to a shaky start with accusations of widespread electoral fraud. But President Salinas, a young, Harvard-trained economist, quickly erased doubts about his forcefulness, ordering the arrest of the powerful head of the petroleum workers' union.
As he consolidated his power, Mr. Salinas made a very public effort to fight corruption. During his term, the Treasury Department brought its first substantial tax evasion cases in 50 years and he revamped the notoriously corrupt Mexican Customs Service. Despite his short stature and the mild-mannered appearance created by his baldness and an impish smile, he imposed his will on almost every aspect of Mexican life. But he had trouble controlling his big brother Raul.
Raul had been Carlos's constant companion when they were children and they remained close as adults.
Raul studied civil engineering and planning at Mexico's National Autonomous University. Like his father and brothers, he went into government service, but without great distinction.
He became notorious for his lavish way of life. He was often in the company of beautiful women, and he maintained an expensive stable of horses for equestrian competitions in Switzerland and the United States. His Government salary was generous: $190,000 annually in a country where the minimum wage is $3 a day. He had no record as a businessman.
The 1989 edition of the biographical dictionary of the Mexican Government lists his only nongovernment job as a "helper" at an engineering firm from 1970 to 1972.
By 1993, the London-based publication "Mexico and Nafta Report" was pondering the sources of Raul's sudden wealth. "Raul is widely supposed to have used his position to indulge in the traditional occupation of a presidential relative -- making money."
In the early 1990's, the issue of Raul Salinas's wealth was so widely discussed it began to register as an issue in the ruling party's polling of ordinary Mexicans.
Several of President Salinas' close advisers, who spoke on the condition that they not be identified, said they told Carlos Salinas repeatedly that his brother was overstepping even the generous boundaries allowed the ruling class in Mexico. In 1992, the president encouraged his brother to leave Mexico for a year at the University of California Center for United States-Mexican Studies in San Diego.
Adolfo Aguilar Zinser, a Mexican legislator investigating Raul Salinas's activities, said his voracious appetite for the good life was well known in Mexico throughout much of his brother's Administration. When the president's big brother left to study at San Diego, there was no misunderstanding what it meant, Mr. Aguilar Zinser said. He had been sent away to keep a low profile and to avoid trouble.
Western diplomats in Mexico say that when their governments' experts briefed them on the country, they learned that Raul was known in Mexican gossip as "Mr. Ten Percent," the purported price for his putting in a good word with his brother's Administration.
Raul Salinas mused on the subject in a 1990 volume of poetry he called "The Secret, One Day:"
If you rob from many 100 percent
There could be a moral offense.
A few points more, a few points less
Morality is a question of percent.
Mr. Salinas acknowledged to Swiss investigators that his efforts to move his money out of Mexico began in 1989 -- months after his brother took office.
While he declined to explain how he had earned his fortune, he acknowledged that his early efforts to deposit it in overseas bank accounts were amateurish. Mr. Salinas said he obtained a fake passport in a name similar to that of his trusted accountant in 1988.
A year later, Mexican investigators said, Mr. Salinas and his girlfriend at the time, Margarita Nava Sanchez, opened an account under the name of Maramex Corp. at Banque Pictet -- a secretive private bank in Geneva that has long catered to the world's rich.
The principals of Maramex were Ms. Nava Sanchez and Juan Guillermo Gomez Gutierrez, Mr. Salinas's new alias. In 1991, according to a Drug Enforcement Administration document, they made a deposit of $6 million.
Mr. Salinas also went on a buying spree in Mexico, purchasing dozens of properties and listing them under his alias. One elegant house in the swank Lomas de Chapultepec section of the Mexican capital was purchased that way. It became Mr. Salinas's "Casa Chica" -- the house in which his mistresses lived.
 
Citibank's Role
A Longtime Favorite Of Mexico's Elite
In his year at San Diego, Mr. Salinas wrote, with help, a 42-page monograph entitled "Rural Reform in Mexico." But he also found time to put his financial affairs in order. He opened an account with Citibank's private banking unit, a bank within a bank reserved for the very rich.
It was a natural choice. For decades, rich Mexicans wanting to turn their pesos into dollars and shield them overseas looked to Citibank, which for most of its 67 years in Mexico has been the country's only foreign-based bank.
The bank has long had close ties to Mexico's elite. Citibank's current chairman, John S. Reed, was a personal friend of President Salinas and was warmly received at the official residence "Los Pinos" whenever he visited. William R. Rhodes, one of the bank's vice chairmen, negotiated Mexico's historic debt reduction agreement on behalf of hundreds of foreign banks and was a trusted adviser to the Salinas Administration.
Mexican investigators say Mr. Salinas turned to Citibank at the suggestion of Carlos Hank Rhon, a friend and the millionaire son of one of Mexico's most powerful old-line politicians. Mr. Hank already had an account with Citibank's private banking department.
When Mr. Salinas approached Citibank for help with his finances in early 1993, it happened to be a delicate moment for the bank. The North American Free Trade Agreement, which had already been negotiated with the United States, called on the Mexicans to open up their market to other foreign banks. Those rules were being written in the spring of 1993, and Citibank was eager to preserve as much as possible of its special status in Mexico. In the end, the Salinas Administration granted the new banks only limited access to the market.
Mr. Salinas was introduced to the folkways of sophisticated money management by Mrs. Elliott, a Cuban-American who started in Citibank's human resources department in 1967. She worked her way up the ladder to head the New York-based unit at Citibank that advises wealthy Mexicans.
Private banking is a business that thrives on the fears of the rich in developing countries. Mrs. Elliott said as much in 1994, when she testified for the Government at the trial of two private bankers from American Express International who were accused of money laundering.
The clients, Mrs. Elliott told the jury, "usually come from countries that are in turmoil of some sort" and need a safe place overseas to shelter their money.
Private bankers cultivate close ties with their well-heeled customers, she said. They remember birthdays. They get to know the families. It is, she said, a "white-gloved kind of environment."
"We visit our clients 10 to 12 times a year in their country," Mrs. Elliott told the court.
At a bank like Citibank, the private banking unit is split into regions and sometimes, where warranted, individual countries. Mrs. Elliott said the Mexico unit's 10 relationship managers served 250 Mexican V.I.P.'s, many with a net worth of $5 million or more.
Mexico had a growing number of prospects for private bank accounts in recent years. From 1991 to 1994, the number of billionaires in Mexico exploded from 2 to 24 as President Salinas modernized, privatized and internationalized Mexico's economy.
Asked on the witness stand if she or her team represented "former Mexican political leaders or their families," she replied, "No." Nearly two years before, her client, Raul Salinas, had resigned from his post as a mid-level official in a large Mexican Government agency.
There are risks in private banking. Unscrupulous clients who have made their money illegally -- drug dealers or others -- might open a private banking account and use it to launder their profits into overseas accounts.
To avoid running afoul of the Federal law that prohibits banks from knowingly accepting illicit funds, Mrs. Elliott testified, private bankers take great care with each new customer. They conduct "due diligence" investigations, checking out the client's business background. " 'Know your client,' at least in our bank, is part of the culture," she said. "If you come in with a prospect and/or name of a prospect, you will be sure to be asked, 'Who is this person, what do they do, who introduced them to you,' by at least three or four people higher than you. It's just the way it is."
John Byrne, senior counsel at the American Bankers Association, said a bank opening an account for a foreign client should review his credit standing, business dealings and articles of incorporation of any business. "You're not required to let anyone walk off the streets and let them bank," he said.
Mrs. Elliott said clients opening a private banking account at Citibank were normally asked for two bank references, though this could be waived by a senior official.
Citibank declined to say what steps Mrs. Elliott took to examine the source of Mr. Salinas' millions. Mexican investigators have already learned that Mr. Salinas was allowed to open his private banking account without providing any bank references.
Mexican investigators say Citibank did not ask its office in Mexico City for help with assessing the new client. Top officials at the bank in Mexico City were told only that the New York office had carefully checked out the background of the unidentified account holder.
A Mexico City-based banker who spoke on the condition of anonymity suggested that Mrs. Elliott may have felt pressure to approve the application because of the stature of the Salinas family.
"You have this guy coming to you to open an account, he's the brother of this highly respected president, are you going to say 'I need to see if you've stolen' or 'Give me proof that you haven't put your hand in the cookie jar?' No."
 
The Money Moves
Too Many Millions To Keep Track Of
By opening the private bank account, Mr. Salinas turned most of his financial affairs over to Citibank. He kept his existing accounts under phony names, but gave Citibank broad authority to manage his new deposits. After a while, he told Swiss investigators, he could no longer keep track of his millions as they ricocheted across the world's financial markets.
The details were complex, but the basic principles for handling Mr. Salinas's money were straightforward, and intended to get his money to a safe haven without being traceable. Cashier's checks from Raul Salinas would be sent to the Mexico City office of Citibank, mostly drawn from the accounts of Banca Cremi, a local Mexican bank.
Mrs. Elliott, Mexican investigators say, would call ahead to alert the clerks. After being changed from pesos to dollars, the money went electronically to the bank's own accounts in New York, and then was routed to a Citibank subsidiary in Switzerland. Money poured into the account from other sources besides Citibank's Mexico City office, the Mexican investigators said.
The money was deposited in accounts bearing the name of companies set up in the Caymans, Caribbean islands whose secrecy laws make it possible to create corporations without disclosing their owners. One of the companies set up for this purpose was called Trocca Ltd., according to Mr. Salinas.
Mr. Salinas said Citibank, or more directly Mrs. Elliott, opened new accounts or had new corporations chartered as necessary. She transferred tens of millions back and forth from Switzerland to England when money market rates in London were at their peak.
Mr. Salinas told the Swiss some of the money in his accounts represented a venture fund to "create companies and jobs in Mexico." He declined to say more because he was afraid the information would get back to the Mexican Government, which he said could not be trusted.
 
The Unraveling
In a Swiss Bank, A Police Trap
As the sexenio drew to a close in late 1994, Raul Salinas had at least six Swiss accounts containing more than $100 million, according to a secret United States Drug Enforcement Administration document. Mexican investigators say they have information on more than two dozen other accounts in American banks.
Carlos Peralta Quintero, a Mexican telecommunications magnate, is the only person to acknowledge publicly providing Mr. Salinas with money. He said he gave him $50 million in April 1994 as part of a business deal to develop resort property in Mexico.
Because he and Mr. Salinas are old friends, Mr. Peralta said, he did not draw up any documents for the project. The figure of $50 million was fixed casually over dinner at a New York City restaurant, Mr. Salinas said.
Like many of Raul Salinas's friends, Mr. Peralta had substantial interests before the Mexican Government. He wired the $50 million to Mr. Salinas's accounts just a few months after Bell Atlantic, the American concern, bought a share in his company for $520 million.
The Bell Atlantic investment, documents show, was largely premised on Mr. Peralta's company, Iusacell, having exclusive right to compete with the existing Mexican monopoly for local telephone service. Mexican investigators are now examining the payment to Mr. Salinas. Regulators have refused to allow Iusacell to begin selling phone service outside a small number of trial homes.
Mr. Peralta insisted in an interview earlier this year that his deal with Mr. Salinas was "a gentleman's agreement," and had nothing to do with the phone concession. He has asked his lawyers to work on getting the money back.
On Nov. 30, 1994, the last day of the sexenio, Mr. Salinas and his accountants scurried around completing property transactions in Mexico, transferring ownership of millions of dollars in real estate to untraceable Caymans corporations. It typified the kind of action that Mexicans had come to expect in the last year of an administration, a year derided popularly as "el ano Hidalgo," after a word for "nobleman."
A limerick learned by every Mexican school child curses anyone who, in the "year of Hidalgo," does not steal all he can.
Those verses reflect a widespread cynicism about the impunity with which the Institutional Revolutionary Party has ruled Mexico for the last 67 years.
As the situation in Mexico grew more unstable during 1994, many Mexicans moved their money out in even greater amounts. Over the course of the year, $20 billion left Mexico, according to Rogelio Ramirez de la O, an economist and consultant in Mexico City.
"There is a very high correlation between the capital flight at the end of the sexenio and the ruling family's businesses," said Mr. Ramirez de la O. "The story is repeated every six years."
After his arrest on murder charges in February 1995, Raul Salinas moved to consolidate his holdings. The idea was to close the accounts under aliases, retrieve his phony documents, and put his money in a sophisticated trust in Liechtenstein. Mr. Salinas told the Swiss he was "counseled" to do this by Amy Elliott.
He sent his third wife, Paulina Castanon de Salinas, to Geneva. On Nov. 15 she visited Banque Pictet, which held one of the original accounts Mr. Salinas had opened himself under a false name.
Mrs. Castanon didn't know it, but she was walking into a trap. The Swiss Central Narcotics Division had been watching the account and the safe deposit box her husband had rented. Bank officials had instructions to call the police if anyone tried to get into either one.
When Mrs. Castanon walked into the bank, investigators say, she was told that, regrettably, the vault mechanism was broken, making it impossible to open the safe deposit boxes. Could she come back later, they asked?
She left, and later the Swiss police arrested her and her brother Antonio on suspicions of money laundering and drug trafficking. The next day the Swiss opened the safe deposit box. Inside, they found the original passport issued to Juan Guillermo Gomez Gutierrez. On it was a photograph of Raul Salinas de Gortari. Mrs. Castanon and her brother were released shortly afterward and no charges have been brought.
Mr. Salinas, in his deposition, said he asked his wife to go to Switzerland to retrieve the passport because he knew that the Mexican Government had found out about it and he wanted to keep them from seizing it. He suspects Citibank may have played a role in his wife's arrest.
"I suppose that Mrs. Amy Elliott was looking to clear Citibank of this problem," Mr. Salinas said. "Or she had information of the charges involving drug trafficking, or perhaps she even played a role in my wife getting caught in this trap." Citibank declined to comment on this allegation.
In fact, the stage had been set for her arrest months earlier. The Juan Guillermo Gomez Gutierrez alias came to light when Mexican investigators began checking into the 1994 murder of Mr. Salinas's rival, Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu, the secretary general of the PRI.
Mr. Salinas was implicated, investigators said, and one of the key witnesses turned out to be one of his former mistresses, Maria Bernal Romero. A car used by one of the figures in the assassination was seen at the driveway of the house that Mr. Salinas kept for Ms. Bernal. When the police checked the ownership of "La Casa Chica," they found it was registered in the name of Juan Guillermo Gomez Gutierrez. A motor vehicles check turned up a driver's license in that name, but with a photograph of Raul Salinas.
Officials then found a phony passport under the same name. Mexican investigators say they then put out an international alert for Mr. Salinas's alias, without identifying it as such. The Drug Enforcement Administration was already scrutinizing suspicious accounts in Switzerland opened under that name, and had learned only a few weeks before that it was an alias for Raul Salinas.
 
The Hunt
Global Search Begins For Salinas's Money
The arrest of Mrs. Castanon launched a worldwide hunt for Mr. Salinas's money.
At first, the inquiries focused on possible links to the drug trade. On Nov. 17, two days after the arrest of Mrs. Castanon, Mexican prosecutors sent a letter to Switzerland asking for help in investigating Mr. Salinas's participation in "crimes related to drug trafficking"
Mexican investigators say they and the Americans have since found rumors -- but no evidence -- that Mr. Salinas had relationships with known drug dealers. The inquiries now appear to have shifted to whether the money Mr. Salinas amassed came from Mexican businessmen seeking to curry favor with his brother's Administration.
In Mexico, prosecutors have already charged him with "inexplicable enrichment," that is, making more money as a public servant than one can logically account for. The charges do not identify any specific payment to Mr. Salinas as being illicit or improper. President Zedillo, who is in the second year of his term, has pledged to create a state of law in Mexico, and to go after lawbreakers no matter who they are. The prosecution of Raul Salinas is widely seen here as a sharp break not only with the past Administration, but with the time-honored tradition of the untouchability of a former president and his family.
Mr. Zedillo's own presidency so far has been marked by mixed signs of retreat from absolute power, but also a continuing willingness to impose presidential will, leaving Mexicans less than sure about his commitment to a new order, and whether Mexico has really changed or is simply in the process of completing another six-year cycle.
The next presidential election is scheduled to be held in 2000. The next year of Hidalgo.

U.S. Investigates Citibank Role in Mexican Deals
Through an elaborate series of transfers involving Citibank, Raul Salinas de Gortari, brother of the then-President of Mexico, whisked more than $80 million out of Mexico in 1993 and into Switzerland.
 The Justice Department has opened a criminal investigation of the deals involving Mr. Salinas, who is imprisoned in Mexico, to determine whether Citibank or others violated laws that prohibit banks from knowingly helping criminals hide illicit gains. [Page A1.]
 
U.S. Orders Recalls; Chrysler Balks
The Transportation Department ordered a recall of most 1995-model Chrysler Cirrus and Dodge Stratus cars, saying their rear seat belts were not strong enough. But Chrysler, defending the belts, refused to recall the cars; the Government filed suit. [A14.]
 
A $150 million award against G.M. by an Alabama jury to a man who was thrown from his Chevrolet S-10 Blazer and was paralyzed has brought calls both for tort reform and for an investigation of the auto maker's handling of faulty door latches. [A18.]
 
Insurers Continue Consolidation
The insurance industry continued to move toward consolidation, as First Colony, a major life insurance company, said it was considering a sale, and IPC Holdings, a large Bermuda-based reinsurance broker, bid nearly $1 billion to buy one of its competitors, Tempest Reinsurance. [D4.]
 
Allstate said it would reorganize its property insurance business in Florida, where Hurricane Andrew inflicted $16.5 billion of damage on homeowners four years ago, to limit its liability in future disasters. [D4.]
 
Microsoft Guns for the Internet
Microsoft said it would deploy an array of Internet software services, code-named Normandy, to establish a beachhead in the Internet market. Compuserve, which is to be the first big user of Normandy products, also will make Microsoft's Internet Explorer the main Internet software it distributes on its on-line service. [D8.]
 
Factory Orders Eased in April
Factory orders eased by one-tenth of a percent in April to a seasonally adjusted level of $309.1 billion, after a revised increase of 1.7 percent in March. Aircraft sales were weak, but other goods, notably autos, were strong. [D4.]
 
Ford Sales Increase 1.3%
Ford's domestic vehicle sales rose just 1.3 percent in May. Sales of Lincoln luxury cars and of the Ford Thunderbird and Mercury Cougar lagged, but light-truck sales were solid. [D4.]
 
Retail Issues Pace Market Gain
Stocks advanced, buoyed by retailing issues and steadying interest rates. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 41 points, to 5,665.71. The Nasdaq composite index gained 4.95 points, to 1243.68. [D8.]
 
Apple Plans Convertible Debt
Apple Computer said it would offer $575 million in convertible debt, in a move analysts termed positive. Treasury prices rose for the first time in three sessions, and the yield on the 30-year bond slipped to 7 percent. [D18.]
 
$1.9 Billion Deal For Coke in Britain
Coca-Cola Enterprises agreed to buy the British bottling operations co-owned by Coca-Cola and Cadbury Schweppes P.L.C. for $1.9 billion. The deal continued the company's European expansion. Coca-Cola Enterprises, which had a Dutch operation, bought French and Belgian units in May. [D5.]
 
BellSouth and Time Warner in Link
BellSouth and Time Warner announced a deal to allow Time Warner to offer local telephone service in the Southeast. But while the Baby Bells -- Ameritech and Bell Atlantic have also announced deals -- eagerly portrayed the links as competitive milestones, analysts saw no guarantee of real competition. [D4.]
 
Internet Guidelines Proposed
At an F.T.C. hearing, the on-line and direct marketing industries proposed voluntary guidelines to protect Internet users against unauthorized collection of personal data. Civil liberties groups were critical. [D19.]

HEADLINE: POLITICS: ROSS PEROT;
Reform Party Is Scheduling Its Convention For August

BYLINE: By ERNEST TOLLERSON 

 BODY:
The Presidential nominating convention of the Ross Perot-backed Reform Party will in all likelihood be sandwiched between the conventions of the Republican and Democratic Parties in August, Mr. Perot said today.
Mr. Perot offered details of the Reform Party's plans in an interview with reporters and executives of The New York Times. During the discussion, he declined to say when he would decide whether he would seek the nomination of the Reform Party. Since announcing plans to create the party last fall, he has encouraged other candidates to come forward but has declined to divulge his own plans. 
 In the interview Mr. Perot generally avoided criticism of President Clinton and Senator Bob Dole, the likely Republican nominee. But he said the tenor of the campaign had so far been unnecessarily negative.
In a wide ranging discussion of domestic policy, Mr. Perot warned of the possibility of a financial disaster.
Mr. Perot said the nation was "on the edge of a cliff."
"If we keep doing what we are doing, we will have a financial meltdown that makes the Depression look like a cakewalk."
He said a financial disaster "would start with Wall Street because you've got too much money chasing too few stocks."
Americans ought to care about this possibility, he said, because of pensions funds invested in stocks and mutual funds.
He discussed the need to bring spending on Social Security, Medicare and other middle-class entitlements under control. But he refused to offer specific solutions other than to say it would take an investment of millions to convene the experts to produce solutions to complex domestic policy problems.
He repeated his belief that future Federal tax increases be subject to approval by the voters.
In describing details of the Reform Party's election year plans, Mr. Perot said any candidate would have to sign a written pledge not to engage in negative politics. "If they do, they will be dropped off the ballot the next day," he said. But he did not say what would be considered a violation of the ban on negative campaigning.
Once the Federal Election Commission has clarified the fund-raising rules for the Reform Party's Presidential candidate, Mr. Perot said, fund-raising would begin. For example, he said that the party could seek contributions from the six million small business owners, whom he described as "America's forgotten heroes."
"They employ 80 million people and dwarf the Fortune 500 in terms of who they employ," Mr. Perot said. Raising the money for the fall campaign, he said, would not be a problem. Winning election commission approval to transfer the money he is entitled to as a 1992 candidate to the candidate of the Reform Party is the hurdle, he said.
"Whoever the candidate is," he said, "we will go out and have the mother of all fund-raising campaigns at the grass-roots level."
The nomination playing field Mr. Perot described appears to be one that he would run well on, given the rules he sketched out and his eligibility for about $30 million in Federal campaign funds based on his 18.9 percent share of the popular vote in 1992.
During his discussion of the Reform Party nominating process, Mr. Perot said those who do not attend the convention, which party officials say is likely to be held in a West Coast city, will be able to watch it on C-Span. All those eligible to vote will have a variety of options, including voting electronically and mailing in a paper ballot.
"All of the people who signed petitions will have a ballot that cannot be forged or duplicated," he said. "They can vote from their home, they can vote from the local auditorium. If they want to put together an auditorium, we'll satellite it down to them."
Because of the time it takes to receive and tally paper ballots, Mr. Perot said, results would probably be announced a week after the day of voting. Asked what would happen if no candidate received a clear majority, Mr. Perot said, "If we need to have a runoff, we'll have a runoff."
He said that any potential candidate would have to gather 130,000 signatures, or 10 percent of the 1.3 million people who either enrolled in or signed petitions for the party.
Mr. Perot also predicted that his party would influence the outcome of Congressional races. "We will formally endorse in each House and Senate race the candidate committed to reform," he said. "And I think in virtually 100 percent of the cases, but in a lot of the cases, we will be able to provide the swing vote to put that candidate into office."
He upbraided President Clinton and Mr. Dole, the Senate majority leader, for proposing tax decreases to win votes in November. "And there is a horse race to see who is going to give us the biggest one, right?" he said.
Mr. Perot criticized Mr. Dole's plan to call a Senate vote on the balanced budget amendment. "Believe it or not, after leaving the balanced budget amendment in the Senate like a whale on the beach for months, at one time needing one vote," Mr. Perot said, now, there is even less support because Senator Bob Packwood, one of the supporters, is gone.
Mr. Perot said that even though Mr. Dole knows that he does not have enough votes for passage, "he's going to force a vote -- isn't it interesting?
"I don't understand their logic, frankly trying to force a vote now."
Asked to assess President Clinton's plan for a tax credit for part of the expenses of a college education, the centerpiece of the President's commencement address at Princeton University yesterday, Mr. Perot said students who failed to repay their loans created problems for the college loan program.
He criticized Mr. Clinton's proposing the idea, saying: "The free candy that bothers me is going to a graduation and promising people, who said it, Lenin or Marx, coined the term 'tell the people what they want to hear.' That's what American politics is today. Take a poll, find out what you want to hear and tell you that and get elected and don't do it."
Asked whether he favored changes in another middle-class benefit, the home mortgage interest deduction, he said he had not studied it but nevertheless thought it would not "chew up our budget completely."
Mr. Perot also defended his strategy of outlining problems like overhauling Social Security and other Federal programs without proposing specific policy solutions.
"Again if you had access to all of this, it will take millions of investment to draw the blueprint for each of these, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera," he said. "I couldn't make a car just by focusing on the wheels or focusing on the roof or focusing on the engine. You got to think of the whole car as a system."
To repair the Medicare program, Mr. Perot said, the Federal Government would "have to have the time and the money and the talented team."

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE VOTERS;
Poll Indicates Stable Ratings For President

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

 BODY:
The standings of President Clinton and Senator Bob Dole remain relatively unchanged from polls of two months ago, despite events that could have roiled the Presidential race, including the convictions of Mr. Clinton's former business partners and Mr. Dole's resignation from the Senate, the latest New York Times/ CBS News Poll shows.
The survey also found that economic concerns had receded somewhat as an issue and that crime had become the most important problem for voters, even though Federal statistics show dramatic drops in many big cities' crime rates. 
 Mr. Dole's efforts to seize on the crime issue in recent weeks have not helped him blunt the President's popularity. Voters give neither man an edge in addressing crime, though Mr. Clinton was perceived as likely to do better at dealing with such root causes of crime as unemployment and poverty, while Mr. Dole was seen as better able to set a moral and religious tone for the country.
The poll is based on telephone interviews with 1,200 adults around the country from Friday through Monday and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
Several findings show Mr. Clinton continuing to display striking political resilience, to the point of enjoying slight upturns in many areas, while Mr. Dole's efforts to gain ground have thus far not been successful. Over all, Mr. Clinton's job approval rating remains steady at 51 percent, while 42 percent gave Mr. Dole such a rating, a drop of 10 points from the last Times/CBS News matchup in early April. The President even gained nine points on his handling of foreign policy, to 52 percent approval, one of the highest ratings in that area since he was elected.
If the election were held today, 54 percent of registered voters said they would back the President, while 35 percent said they preferred Mr. Dole. That is a slight improvement for Mr. Clinton since the last poll.
In another notable sign of strength for the President's party, Democratic candidates are favored over Republicans for the House of Representatives by 45 percent to 38 percent. That edge, combined with results showing Speaker Newt Gingrich is still quite unpopular among voters, could hearten Democrats in their quest to retake control of Congress in November.
In the survey, nearly a quarter of Americans volunteered that crime and drugs were the biggest problem. Americans also said they were particularly worried about teen-age violence, with more than 8 in 10 saying crimes committed by young people were on the rise nationwide. The escalation of fears about teen-age crime may be a result of concern about a rapid rise in violence among youth, and nearly 9 of 10 polled said they would support an 11 P.M. curfew on children under age 18. That idea that has drawn support from both Mr. Clinton and Mr. Dole.
Beyond his appeals on crime, Mr. Dole, the almost certain Republican nominee, bluntly criticized Mr. Clinton last week on matters of "character and credibility" in the wake of the verdicts in the Whitewater case. Still, asked specifically whether the convictions of his former partners in Arkansas affected their opinion of Mr. Clinton, an overwhelming 76 percent of Americans said it would not, while only 19 percent said it would. And while 6 of 10 Americans said the President was mostly telling the truth about Whitewater but also hiding something, that figure has not appreciably changed in months.
In follow-up interviews, several Americans who participated in the poll brushed off Whitewater. "We all have skeletons in the closet," said Carletta May, 37, a machine operator from Chicago and self-described independent. "Nobody's perfect. It was a different time, and it hasn't really affected the country."
Paul Leduc, 52, a hazardous-waste technician from Lowell, Mass., who is a Republican, put it this way: "I don't think there is anything major going on there. A lot of them do it anyway. If they found out he was lying or getting some of the money, then I would change my mind about him."
The survey showed that Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is identified even more closely with the Whitewater case, enjoyed a slight improvement in her popularity from two months ago, though her ratings remained relatively low. Thirty-six percent of Americans expressed a favorable opinion of her, while 35 percent held an unfavorable view.
Though the Clintons do not seem to have sustained any more damage over Whitewater, public attention to the case has increased. Forty-three percent said they have heard or read a lot about the Clintons' investment in Whitewater, up from 33 percent in January.
The only evidence of movement in the Presidential campaign because of Whitewater was in a question about whether the Clintons "did something wrong." Thirty percent said the Clintons did something wrong, up slightly from 23 percent last August. But a plurality of 45 percent said they were still reserving judgment. And the modest slippage could have happened even before the Whitewater verdicts, because that particular question had not been asked since last August.
Even without the Whitewater verdicts, Mr. Dole's advisers had hoped that his dramatic announcement last month that he would step down as majority leader as well as quit the Senate outright would help shake the electoral dynamics. Instead, the poll contained several signs of weakness for Mr. Dole. His favorable rating is 29 percent, down from 37 percent in April, while his unfavorable rating is steady at 35 percent.
Particularly troubling for Mr. Dole is that even as he tries to soften his image and explain his positions, he is widely viewed as being more concerned with attacking the President, while Mr. Clinton is seen as more substance oriented. This may because as the incumbent, Mr. Clinton has the advantage of casting many issue positions as driven by policy rather than politics.
Only 32 percent perceived Mr. Dole's campaign as "explaining what he would do if elected President," while 48 percent said he was devoting more time to attacking Mr. Clinton. By contrast, 53 percent perceived Mr. Clinton as explaining what he would do, while just 28 percent saw him as mainly attacking his likely opponent.
Even as he prepares to depart the Senate next week after more than three decades on Capitol Hill, Mr. Dole's links to Republicans in Congress still hurt him. Fifty-four percent said that if Republicans continued to control Congress, it would be better to re-elect Mr. Clinton "to limit the power of the Republicans in Congress." Mr. Gingrich's image remains negative, with 33 percent approving of his job performance, while 48 percent disapprove.
That Mr. Dole is 72 years old also continues to divide the public's view of him. Forty-four percent said Mr. Dole's ideas were "behind the times," while another 44 percent said he was "in step with the times."
Despite the relative good news for Mr. Clinton in the survey, the general election is still five months away, and the poll turned up some potential vulnerabilities in his quest for a second term. Notably, Mr. Clinton still draws little credit for improvement in the economy, in part because many people perceive little progress. While 46 percent approve Mr. Clinton's handling of the economy, 42 percent disapprove.
Moreover, 29 percent said the economy was worsening, more than twice the 13 percent who said it was getting better. A majority of 57 percent said the economy was staying the same.
In what Mr. Dole's advisers said might be their best hope for November, Mr. Clinton fared somewhat worse that the Senator in perceptions of honesty and integrity. Forty percent said Mr. Dole has more honesty and integrity than most people in public life, while 30 percent said that for Mr. Clinton.
Even as Mr. Clinton seeks to move to the right and seize issues once the province of Republicans, 79 percent of Americans said there were important differences in what Mr. Dole and Mr. Clinton stand for. Each candidate is viewed by a majority as having changed at least some stands in the campaign.
Most who saw Mr. Clinton as shifting said he was trying to become more conservative. But those who perceived Mr. Dole as shifting were evenly divided about whether he was trying to become more liberal or more conservative.
Some poll respondents who agreed to follow-up interviews said that while they had qualms about Mr. Clinton, Whitewater simply was not a big deal to them. "I've got to assume that he's telling the truth," said Elsie Baker, 79, a Democrat who is a retired printer in Desert Hot Springs, Calif. "We're all human. He's still the best man for the job. It doesn't affect him being the President."
 
How the Poll Was Conducted
The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Friday through Monday with 1,200 adults throughout the United States.
The sample of telephone exchanges called was randomly selected by a computer from a complete list of more than 36,000 active residential exchanges across the country.
Within each exchange, random digits were added to form a complete telephone number, thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers. Within each household, one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey.
The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to geographic region, race, sex, age, and education.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults.
For smaller subgroups the potential sampling error is larger. For example, it is plus or minus five percentage points for either Democrats or Republicans or independents taken as a separate group.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. Variations in question wording or the order of questions, for instance, can lead to somewhat different results.

HEADLINE: Don't Discriminate on Mental Health Benefits

 BODY:
To the Editor:
How disappointing it is to see you parroting the party line of the insurance industry in recommending continued discrimination against the mentally ill ("Mr. Dole's Health-Care Task," editorial, May 30). There is only one remedy that serves both justice and human need: access to treatment for mental disorders fully equal to that for other diseases.
Those who suffer with schizophrenia, depression, panic disorder, addictions, childhood disturbances and other mental afflictions will tell you that the unbearable pain exceeds anything they have known. These conditions interfere with work, school and family life. They often lead to suicide, one of the top 10 causes of death in the United States and a killer of young people. 
 You uncritically echo the insurance industry line in quoting a 10 percent cost of full parity rather than the 2.5 to 3.9 percent estimates reported by highly respected actuarial firms. The argument that employers will drop coverage has proved false in a number of states that have had the courage to mandate parity.
That the public wants full integration of treatment of mental with other diseases became clear in the hearings that led to the Oregon plan for prioritizing health-care services. That treatment of mental illness results in large cost savings in medical care and economic productivity has been proved again and again.
When you are willing to talk about "basic health benefits" for selecting which heart conditions will be treated and how much, perhaps you can justifiably recommend limited "basic benefits" for mental illnesses. Until that time, the discrimination in third-party payment for mental illness is not only shortsighted but an outrage to suffering people at a disadvantage in defending their interests.

HEADLINE: UNDER THE HOOD WITH: Lucille Treganowan;
Life's Miraculous Transmissions

BYLINE: By CAROL LAWSON 

DATELINE: PITTSBURGH

 BODY:
YOU step on the gas and turn the key: the car starts. You shift into drive: the car rolls forward.
Big deal. 
 Well, to Lucille Treganowan, it is a big deal. And more.
"It's a miracle!" exclaims Mrs. Treganowan, a Pittsburgh grandmother who, for 23 years, has been the owner and driving force, so to speak, of Transmissions by Lucille. "If you knew everything a transmission had to do to go from a dead stop and shift into gear, you would respect it forever."
Mrs. Treganowan is as car crazy as a teen-ager. A big woman with blondish-gray hair swept up in a perfect French twist, she sits behind the wheel of her new tank-size driving machine, a shiny black Cadillac Coupe de Ville. We are driving across Pittsburgh, from one Lucille auto shop to the other.
"It's just perfect," she says of her car. "It has a very peppy engine. A really economical and powerless car would drive me nuts. I want to step on the gas and zoom, go as fast as I want, with everything handling really well."
At 66, Mrs. Treganowan (pronounced TREG-ah-noun) finds her own life in peak condition. She is the star of "Lucille's Car Care Clinic," a cable show on the Home and Garden Television Network. The network says the show is broadcast in 714 cities. And next week, she goes on the road to promote her new book, "Lucille's Car Care" (Hyperion). She says that while she has been "a local legend" in Pittsburgh for years, with lots of attention from home-grown media, her forays into the wider world are still sinking in.
Of television, she says, "It's amazing how much better they can make you look."
Born in Iola, Kan., Mrs. Treganowan didn't grow up yearning to repair cars. In fact, she didn't know a transmission from a turnip when she and her husband divorced in 1960, leaving her in Pittsburgh to care for three young children. She was doing part-time clerical work at an auto repair shop, and customers would often ask her questions about their cars. Her reply, she says, was always, "I don't know, I don't know." Finally, she decided she had to know, and she began asking the mechanics questions, reading, and working on cars. She went into business for herself in 1973.
She pulls into the parking lot of her shop on an industrial strip of dirty brick buildings on the eastern edge of the city. Years ago, Mrs. Treganowan figured out how to make her garages stand out. She painted them white, with sea-blue trim, and ringed the parking lots with planters that were originally transmissions.
Inside, on the front counter, is a transmission that has been partly cut apart to expose its numerous inner parts. It is her favorite prop. "The automatic transmission is almost like the human body," says Mrs. Treganowan, who for years made side money teaching "Powder Puff Mechanic" classes for women. "The case is like the skin. The gear train is like the skeleton. The front pump is like the heart. It has to pump the hydraulic fluid."
She laughs. "If the pump fails, it's like your heart failing: you're gone."
Transmissions are more than a business for her. They are a passion. Brakes and mufflers are nothing to get excited about. But ah, the mystery, the challenge of a hopelessly broken-down, greasy transmission!
"With many car repairs, you can take a look and say, This is worn out and we'll fix it," Mrs. Treganowan says. "But with an automatic transmission, you can have a problem that can't be seen. It becomes like the most complicated of all Nintendo games. You have to trace every circuit, every pressure and electrical impulse to find the problem. The diagnostic part is what intrigued me in the beginning. That's where the fun is."
While Mrs. Treganowan knows how to repair transmissions -- she has scars from cuts and burns to prove it -- she rarely works on cars herself anymore (even though the cover of her book touts her as "America's most trusted mechanic"). She prefers the term "diagnostician" for herself, and calls the 21 men in her repair crew "automotive technicians."
Her book offers standard advice on car maintenance -- and then some. For example, she suggests that when leaning over the car to look under the hood, keep in mind that "belt buckles really do a number on your car's paint."
To test the shocks and struts, she says, "push down on the hood as hard as you can, and then step back to observe the bounce."
And car owners trying to stop rust from spreading, she says, will find that if they don't want to bother with the cosmetics of matching paint, clear nail polish is a good substitute.
Mrs. Treganowan is at work by 7 A.M., after her daily half-hour walk. She goes back and forth between her two shops and often takes cars for test drives when they come in and again after they are repaired.
"To fix something and then drive it down the street and have it shift just perfectly -- boom, boom, boom -- makes me think, 'Wow!' " she says.
Her working conditions are not enviable. Heavy tools slam and bang against metal all day long in her garages, which are stocked with about 130 rebuilt transmissions. The air is thick with the mingling odors of engine oil and burnt transmission fluid.
Mrs. Treganowan says she is oblivious to it all. "People ask, 'Why do you talk so loud?' " she says. "I guess it's because I'm always talking above the noise."
Her small office above the garage used to be her living room. Mrs. Treganowan lived there for many years before moving to Penn Hills, a suburb. Her son Kip is the shop foreman. Her other son, Todd, and her daughter, Tana, are not in the business.
"Instead of having a normal home life, my kids grew up in the garage," she says.
Just then Kip Treganowan walks by in navy overalls. He says that while he has always liked cars, he was "never crazy like some people, who just live or die for their cars."
"Oh, yeah?" his mother retorts. "Let's go outside and kick his Lincoln and see if he still says that."
Mrs. Treganowan says she was "too proud" to return to Kansas after her divorce, so she stayed in Pittsburgh even though it was a tough place for a single mother.
"Years ago, a divorced woman with children was persona non grata here," she recalls. "Some neighbors didn't want their children to play with mine because they were from a broken home. That's how bad it was."
But from the moment she opened her business, the Pittsburgh newspapers and a local television station were very friendly. Mrs. Treganowan's story -- a woman trying to make it in a down-and-dirty man's world -- had all the drama of a soap opera. She had no money for advertising, so she quickly mastered the art of self-promotion.
"I was a curiosity, so I always got freebies," she says, leafing through her newspaper clippings. "Male-owned shops would die for this free stuff, just die for it."
The publicity never stopped. Even her graduation from Chatham College in 1991 was local news.
Mrs. Treganowan credits her father, who ran a plumbing and heating business in Iola, for much of her success. "He treated me just like my two brothers," she says. "I was taught to believe that I could do anything. It never occurred to me that I shouldn't be in the transmission business because I'm a woman. That's not how I was raised."
That is the message she delivers when she speaks to groups of women who are entering the job market. "It is so ingrained in women that 'I can't do this, can't do that,' " Mrs. Treganowan says. "I tell them, 'Hey, you can do it."
Her one lingering regret is the sale years ago of her souped-up Pontiac GTO. "It was my favorite car," she says wistfully. "A muscle car." There is mischief in her smile as she recalls the one with the "ungodly power."
"It's used for drag-racing," she explains. "It was what they called a 'sleeper.' A hot car would come up alongside me, and I looked like a normal driver. They couldn't tell I was going to race. Then, zoom, I would leave them in the dust."
Mrs. Treganowan traded in the GTO for a "drudge" when her older son became a teen-age driver. She didn't want him following in her tire tracks.
It is late in the afternoon, time for me to head for the airport for the trip back to New York. My taxi rolls out of the parking lot and into traffic. The carb moves slowly at first. Then, a surge of power: the car speeds up.
It's a miracle.

HEADLINE: DESIGN NOTEBOOK;
Good Neighbors Make Good Fences

BYLINE: By PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
SEARCHING for the spirit of America? Light up the grill. Look at the fence.
Be it wood or wire (or, heaven forfend, plastic) the fence is such a ubiquitous part of the landscape that it tends to psychically disappear. But as "Between Fences," a new exhibition at the National Building Museum in Washington, points out, by their fences ye shall know them. 
 Like freckled Norman Rockwell boys peeping through a knothole, fences provide a window onto unexplored corners of American culture. "Fences are everywhere," said Gregory K. Dreicer, the show's curator, who grew up in Queens surrounded by chain-link, which now accounts for more than half of the 72,000 miles of residential fencing sold in the United States each year. "We think we know them, but we don't. They help us understand our world."
Mythicized by writers from Mark Twain and Robert Frost to August Wilson, the humble fence, be it obscured today by ivy or signs that say "Beware of Dog," comes with its own history and politics.
Since Colonial days, fences have symbolized both freedom and submission, democracy and tyranny, the thin staccato line between the public and private realm. Range wars weren't fought over roofs. In a country obsessed with property, fences stake a claim, reflecting deep beliefs about who has rights to land and resources.
And they are a form of architectural shorthand, rhythmic Rorschachs, whether a forbidding coil of urban razor wire or a bucolic Massachusetts chair rail so smooth you can run your hand across it. "Fences are essential vernacular jewelry," said the architect Jacquelin Robertson. "They are the keyboard instrument of architecture." Mr. Robertson and Robert A. M. Stern designed the master plan for Celebration, the new Disney community in Florida that prominently features picket fences.
Throughout history, Mr. Dreicer writes in the show's catalogue, published by the museum and the Princeton Architectural Press, fences have been "essential to the way we think about land, the way we behave on that land and the way we expect our land to look." Seemingly innocuous, fences have been an essential means of defining who is deemed civilized. The fact that American Indians didn't fence their property became, in the eyes of the colonists, the justification for claiming the land as theirs.
Fences were a major preoccupation on the frontier, as the show, which was financed by 61 fence companies and which runs through Jan. 5, makes clear. The abandon with which settlers used wood, especially the zigzaggy "worm fence" hewn from hickory and other durable woods stacked like matchsticks, led to a serious depletion of timber. Without the invention of wire fencing and the technology to mass-produce it (a real live chain-link machine is the show's piece de resistance), settling the frontier might have taken a different turn.
The introduction of barbed wire in 1874, known as "vicious wire," closed the open range and sounded the death knell for the "marvelous windblown sea of grass," as John Brinckerhoff Jackson, a historian of the American landscape, describes the Texas frontier. Fence wars pitted cattlemen against farmers, homesteaders against ranchers, ranchers against sheepherders. But as Professor Jackson points out, barbed wire remained an alien intruder, psychologically easy to remove. It was "used and perceived not as a means of creating a unique space," he writes, but of controlling movement.
Even the innocent-looking picket fence covered with roses, perhaps the most potent symbol of home for young G.I. families after World Ward II, did not have completely innocent origins, growing out of the fortification, or palisade, of frontier garrisons. According to Philip Dole, a professor of architecture at the University of Oregon, pointed stakes, six feet high, surrounded the Louis Bolduc house in Ste. Genevieve, Mo., to protect it from Indians and "the flow of cattle along the streets."
Early fences were primarily defensive. Penetration of fences by hogs, which squirmed sideways between the slats, was a continuing problem for Colonial Heloises.
In the 19th century, the picket fence became a symbol of individual achievement, prosperity, domestic tranquillity and small-town life. The expression "beyond the pale" literally means "beyond the fence," pale being a synonym for picket. The picket's rise and fall -- and recent mini-rise again in places like Celebration -- speaks to Americans' changing ideas about home. By the early 20th century, the picket fence was in decline, as popular landscape theorists like A. J. Downing advocated more naturalistic yards that minimized boundaries and made plots look bigger. Mr. Downing called them "an abomination among fresh fields, of which no person of taste could be found guilty." A fenceless lawn, notes John Stilgoe, a professor of environmental studies at Harvard University, "gave the illusion of a richer and more spacious neighborhood."
That ideal still flourishes today, especially in planned developments where chain-link fences are often prohibited, for esthetic reasons, and design ordinances strictly dictate allowable fence styles. In many housing developments, observes Seth Emmer, a Braintree, Mass., lawyer who specializes in community associations, "neighbors' houses and yards are so identical, and there is so much control of the environment, that you don't need a barrier." In other words, who needs a fence when the whole community is gated?
But fences, especially the picket, are on the rebound for practical reasons -- protecting dogs, children and swimming pools -- as well for more deeply rooted ones. Fences are democratic, Mr. Robertson said, "covering all levels of style, income and taste, from the cozy cottage to the great manor house." And people like them.
As the show documents, the latest trend is the development of plastic fences, including plastic picket fences. Somehow, as sacrilegious as it may initially appear, the very notion of the plastic picket fence seems inevitable and quintessentially American, perfect for contemporary Tom Sawyers bearing Handi Wipes instead of whitewash.
 
'I Gave In at the Office'
 
TO Deborah Durham, a self-described "deckonomist" (translation: a home economist who specializes in outdoor living, specifically decks), fences create an outdoor room for entertaining, a genre less "fear based" than the indoor variety. "It's an attempt to create a private oasis," she said, "especially if you can't take the summer off and go to the Hamptons."
Ms. Durham, who lives in Pacific Palisades, Calif., with her two cats, concocts outdoor entertaining hints for S. C. Johnson Wax, which, among other things, makes citronella candles to ward off stinging guests of the nonsarcastic variety.
Hint: Use a plastic shower curtain as a tablecloth, preferably one in solid teal to simulate the ocean (for added atmosphere, sprinkle sand). Or do what Ms. Durham does: order takeout ribs from Tony Roma's.
Johnson Wax recently released an "outdoor living" poll of 1,000 homeowners, which offers this tender nugget of revelation in answer to the burning question: Who do people like most to have around their backyard retreats?
 
Immediate family . . . 66 percent
Relatives . . . 60 percent
Friends . . . 20 percent
No one . . . 6 percent
Neighbors . . . 2 percent
People from work . . . 1 percent

Re "From Welfare to the Top of Her Class" (Metro Matters, June 3): As another, and earlier, simultaneous graduate of both the public welfare system and the state public education system, I salute Kimberli Rothwell, who has just graduated summa cum laude from Queens College via the SEEK program and who is bound for the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill for doctoral training in sociology. 
 Ms. Rothwell's deep-seated ambivalence about welfare and welfare "cheats" and her view of herself as "exceptional," while understandable, is disconcerting. While not all graduates of the welfare system become tasseled and hooded graduates of the university, we need to sing the praises of the ordinary "masses" (as Ms. Rothwell calls them) of welfare mothers who have succeeded in surviving the often mean-spirited American welfare system and who have contributed their share as hard-working women and mothers.
There isn't a single one among us, I am sure, who managed to escape the scorn and economic anxiety that accompanies "living off the dole" in America. Most of what gets labeled "welfare fraud" is little more than the creative ingenuity of mothers trying to overcome the odds against them and their children, still so often viewed as "surplus" populations.
In my own case I supplemented my then-$120 monthly welfare grant with occasional small earnings as a research assistant during a difficult year. I doubt that I revealed every cent of those earnings to my caseworker. I once made the error of sharing with her the information that my child's new stroller was purchased with the small birthday gift money sent me by my parents back in Queens. She immediately deducted $35 from my next month's welfare check, making that month a disaster for Jennifer and me.
Representations of the welfare mother are further distorted by the "masses" of women who, once they have left the system behind, never mention it again. Often it is quite unconscious. My own consciousness was raised more than a decade after I left the welfare rolls when, as I was teaching an introductory anthropology class, the students began to engage in a discussion of poverty that turned into a hate feast of negative stereotypes. I allowed them to play out the ugly scenario to the finish. Then I asked them if they resented having a former welfare recipient as their professor.
Virginia Woolf once suggested that poverty, ridicule and freedom from unreal loyalties were the three great teachers of women. They may also be the three great teachers of our students, colleagues, neighbors and co-workers with whom we might wish to share our experiences as former welfare recipients at this decisive moment in welfare history.

HEADLINE: A Tax Cut We Can't Afford

BYLINE: By Roger C. Altman; Roger C. Altman was Deputy Secretary of the Treasury in 1993 and 1994.

 BODY:
This is the wrong time for a giant income tax cut. The economy is sound, inflation and interest rates are subdued and the budget deficits are sharply lower. But they were brought down through a bloody political war of attrition. A sweeping cut would throw away this progress and bring back the era of soaring deficits.
Nevertheless, a group of conservative economists and Republican senators is urging Bob Dole to make a 15 percent across-the-board income tax cut, rather than a balanced budget, the economic centerpiece of his Presidential campaign. This would cost nearly $650 billion over seven years -- more than twice as much as the tax cuts that Congress recently passed and that President Clinton vetoed. 
 How strange. Senator Dole has a long and impressive record of opposing deficits. Today, partly because of his efforts, the deficit represents only 1 percent of the economy, the lowest figure in a generation.
The proponents of a tax cut don't explicitly endorse bigger deficits. Some say that lower taxes will cause so much growth that Federal revenues will rise faster than projected, and that the budget won't be destabilized -- the old supply-side nostrum. Others assert that we will reduce spending enough to pay for a big tax cut without inflating the deficit.
Both claims are unfounded. We tried supply-side cuts in the early 1980's under President Ronald Reagan -- and saw record deficits, a quadrupling of the national debt and the rate of private savings reduced by half.
As for any offsetting reductions in Federal spending, Congressional Republicans have been unable to achieve a budget that includes a $250 billion cut over seven years. The notion that $400 billion more in spending cuts is available is absurd.
Big tax cuts would deepen our overriding economic and social problem: declining living standards. The real wages of more than half of all working Americans have fallen in the last decade. The reason is that income is tied to productivity, which is driven by savings and investment, and these have lagged. To pay for the huge deficits, the Government borrowed the private savings that would have financed investment. Today, any portion of a new tax cut that would enable Americans to put money in the bank would be more than offset by the commensurate rise in the deficit and the use of that money to pay for it.
 It isn't that all tax cuts would be unsound. But we need reductions that would increase savings and investments, not consumption. Expanded I.R.A.'s and incentives for greater pension contributions by corporations should be encouraged, and, yes, the capital gains tax should be lower.
It would be astonishing for Senator Dole, a steadfast advocate of sound fiscal policy, to embrace a giant income tax cut. He rightly described similar cuts proposed by Steve Forbes as snake oil. Let's hope he chooses consistency over hypocrisy.

HEADLINE: Good Call on Credit Cards

 BODY:
In a ruling involving billions of dollars, a unanimous Supreme Court this week upheld the right of national banks to charge late fees on overdue credit-card accounts -- in addition to charging interest -- even if a card-holder lives in a state that prohibits such fees. This was a clear victory for banks with interstate credit-card operations. But the outcome also stands to benefit consumers.
The opinion, written by Justice Antonin Scalia, rejected a class-action lawsuit against Citibank by California residents who contended that late charges assessed by Citibank on their overdue Visa and Mastercard accounts were "unconscionable" and, further, illegal under a California consumer-protection law. Citibank, the nation's biggest issuer of bank credit cards, conducts its business from South Dakota. 
 South Dakota and Delaware were the first states to repeal limits on the interest rates banks may charge for credit. To stay competitive, other states, including New York, have been forced to lift their own restrictions. Essentially, the question before the Court boiled down to a choice of which state's law -- California's or South Dakota's -- applied.
Under the National Bank Act, a nationally chartered bank may charge its loan customers "interest at the rate allowed by the laws of the state" in which the bank is situated. The statute was enacted during the Civil War, long before there was a Diners Club to join. But in another case two decades ago, the Court interpreted that provision to apply to a bank's out-of-state credit-card operations.
At issue was whether the word "interest" in the statute encompasses late fees. Ruling in favor of Citibank, the Court deferred to a reasonable regulation issued in February by the Comptroller of the Currency. It defined "interest" to include late payments and other fees "connected with credit extension or availability." The Court found that the Comptroller's definition was rational and thus warranted respect. But to count late fees as "interest" also makes good policy sense since it is part of the cost of using someone else's money.
The decision comes as a relief for federally regulated banks. They had fiercely contested the case, understandably concerned about the possibility of losing about $2 billion in late-payment fees that the banks now collect, and having to refigure interest rates to make up the money.
Some have expressed fear that the decision will hurt consumers. But their concerns seem overwrought. The main effect of the decision is to keep current law in place. That leaves consumers free to shop among hundreds of banks in search of the lowest interest charges and other fees, a competitive market that provides a check against gouging. Had the decision gone the other way, consumers in California would no longer have had the option of using a credit card with the terms offered by those currently issued out of South Dakota.
Moreover, by retaining the ability of banks to impose late fees on customers who fail to pay the minimum due on their bill, the decision allows banks to continue to offer credit to less-well-off customers and to preserve better interest rates for consumers who pay their credit-card bills on time.

HEADLINE: Dollar Rises Despite Remarks Made by Ex-Chairman of Fed

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar ended slightly higher against most leading currencies yesterday, despite a suggestion from a former chairman of the Federal Reserve that the United States and Japan might curb the dollar's rise against the yen.
The former Fed chairman, Paul A. Volcker, said late Tuesday night in Washington that he expected the two countries to take unspecified steps to prevent the dollar from moving to more than 110 Japanese yen. The dollar initially fell yesterday against the yen in Asian trading. 
 "The comments have made people more cautious," said Richard Koss, currency strategist at MFR Inc., a money management and consulting firm. "They probably indicate a struggle is ahead for the dollar."
The comments by Mr. Volcker, now chairman of James D. Wolfensohn Inc., an investment bank, followed remarks by the Ford Motor Company's chief economist, which suggested that the White House might lose enthusiasm for a stronger dollar should it rise much further.
"We're at significant levels," said Jim Phoenix, a currency salesman at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. "Comments like these will continue to have weight."
In trading in New York late yesterday, the dollar rose to 109.02 yen from 108.85 yen on Tuesday. The dollar rose to 1.5308 German marks from 1.5300 marks. The British pound slipped to $1.5475 from $1.5497.
The dollar's recent gains have come amid expectations that interest rates in Japan will hold at record lows until an economic recovery takes hold there. Japan's rates make some investments there less attractive and reduce demand for yen.
Economic growth in the United States, by contrast, may prompt the Fed to raise key interest rates to curb inflation. Signs of the strength of both economies will come tomorrow, when Japan releases its survey of business sentiment and the United States Labor Department reports on May employment.
The dollar was further supported after Japan said its trade surplus shrank in the first 20 days of May. Japan posted a trade deficit of 179.80 billion yen, compared with a 155.15 billion yen surplus in the same period a year ago, confirming that Japanese exporters have less foreign currency to sell for yen.
The dollar also held steady against the mark, even as a report showing a jump in German industrial production in April reduced expectations for lower interest rates there.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bond Prices Rise Ahead Of Jobs Data

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities turned higher in light trading yesterday, getting a lift from falling commodities prices.
Many market participants were busy positioning themselves yesterday for tomorrow's employment report for May. 
 "We're holding our powder dry for Friday," said Stuart G. Hoffman, chief economist at the PNC Bank Corporation in Pittsburgh.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 16/32, to 88 3/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 6.95 percent from the psychologically important level of 7 percent on Tuesday.
Jack Regan, chief investment strategist at Josephthal, Lyon & Ross, described the market as being in a state of suspended animation for most of yesterday's session, not moving more than a quarter of point until late in the afternoon. The Septmber bond futures contract traded between 107 16/32 and 107 24/32 for most of the day, before settling at a price of 108 6/32.
Mr. Regan said short-covering bolstered bond prices heading into the close of the market, as investors who had bet on a drop in prices moved in to buy to limit their losses. The short- covering was prompted by sharp drops in the prices for a number of commodities, especially crude oil and copper.
"People were looking at the falling commodity prices, as copper fell almost 9 cents, which is a big move," Mr. Regan said. Copper prices are a barometer of the strength of the manufacturing sector since it is used in construction, home building and in automobiles. The Commodity Research Bureau index of 17 commodities fell 2.60 points, to 247.45, and has now dropped about 5 percent for the month.
"Tomorrow we have the weekly job-claims data," Mr. Regan noted, "and it will likely not have an effect on trading since everyone in the market is on hold until the witching hour on Friday at 8:30 A.M. when the Labor Department releases the employment estimates for May."
Mr. Regan said he expected that the market has priced in a May report showing a gain in payrolls of between 150,000 to 175,000. A handful of analysts, however, are estimating a gain of more than 200,000.
Mr. Hoffman of PNC Bank said that after pricing in a rate cut by the Federal Reserve earlier this year, the market has reversed itself and has been pricing in a rate increase over the last weeks. "The Fed's next move will be to tighten, not ease, and barring a superstrong number on Friday, the Fed will not have a case to move on rates" at the July meeting of Fed policy makers, he said.
Doug Burtnick, senior fixed-income analyst at Technical Data in Boston, said his company's most recent survey of portfolio managers showed many investors who had not believed that the move to higher rates would continue were now growing more cautious. "It would only take one bad piece of data to convince some of them to throw in the towel," he said.

HEADLINE: Amos Tversky, Expert on Decision Making, Is Dead at 59

BYLINE: By KAREN FREEMAN 

 BODY:
Dr. Amos Tversky, a cognitive psychologist who changed the way experts in many fields think about how people make decisions about risks, benefits and probabilities, died on Sunday at his home in Stanford, Calif. He was 59.
The cause was metastatic melanoma, said Stanford University, where he was the Davis-Brack Professor of Behavioral Sciences. 
 Dr. Tversky (pronounced TUH-VER-skee) once said he merely examined in a scientific way things about behavior that were already known to "advertisers and used-car salesmen," and much of his work has indeed had an economic slant, shaping the way economists look at decision-making by consumers and business executives. It also influenced statisticians and other researchers interested in how decisions involving risk are made in fields like medicine or public policy.
His research showed that people do not always behave rationally when they make decisions, that they generally put more emphasis on risk than benefits and that there are many more quirks in the human reasoning process than many earlier economic and psychological theories had contended.
Dr. Tversky began his work with decision-making in Israel with Dr. Daniel Kahneman, now of Princeton University. When they were instructors at Hebrew University in 1968, Dr. Kahneman said, they became fascinated by how fighter-pilot trainers, taking classes at the university, decided whether to use rewards or punishments to motivate their pilot trainees.
Even though the trainers were told that rewards were more effective, they argued against that idea. The trainers said that when a student was praised for a good flight, he was more likely to do less well the next time. When a student was berated for a poor flight, he tended to do better the next time. Drs. Tversky and Kahneman recognized that the trainers were being misled because they did not recognize that the law of averages would predict that an unusual performance, good or bad, would be likely to be followed by a performance closer to average.
That led them to experiments in the early 1970's showing that people could depend on things other than logic to make decisions, said Dr. Frank Yates, a psychologist at the University of Michigan. In these experiments, for example, two bookbags would be filled with the same number of poker chips; in one bag, two-thirds of the chips would be red and the rest white, with the opposite proportion in the other bag. A sample of chips was drawn from each bag, and the task would be to determine, based on the samples drawn, whether a bag was more likely to have mostly red chips or white chips.
If 5 chips were pulled from one bag and 4 were red, while 30 chips were taken out of the other and 20 were red, most people would say that the first bag was more likely to have mostly red chips because 80 percent of the 5 chips were red -- even though the larger sample size meant that the results for the second bag would be more reliable.
Dr. Barbara Tversky, Amos Tversky's wife and colleague in the Stanford psychology department, said the researchers showed that people tended to see patterns and make connections that were not really there and to base decisions on that.
People were given this scenario: Suppose you pay $10 for a theater ticket but you lose the ticket on the way in -- will you return to the ticket window and buy another ticket? Or, suppose you arrive at the ticket window to buy your $10 ticket but find that you've lost $10 from your wallet. You still have enough money to buy the ticket -- do you go ahead? People would generally refuse to buy a second ticket, but, in the second set of circumstances, would tend to see the loss of the money and the purchase of the ticket as unrelated, so they would buy the ticket. In both cases, of course, the net outcome would be the same.
Dr. Tversky got a lot of attention in 1988 when he released a study during the basketball playoffs showing that contrary to popular belief, a basketball player who had just made a shot was no more likely, and even a little less likely, to make the next one. There is no "hot hand" in basketball, he showed by analyzing every shot taken by the Philadelphia 76ers in a year and a half.
One part of Dr. Tversky's work with particular application to economics and policy making looked at how much importance people place on risks and benefits. If people were asked to choose between a public health program that might save 600 lives or might lose them all and a program that would be guaranteed to save 400 of the 600 lives, they would choose the second program. But if the choice was framed as between a program with a 50 percent chance of saving 600 lives against one that would definitely lose 200 lives while saving 400, the tendency was to choose the first program.
Dr. Tversky was not averse to taking personal risks himself, Dr. Kahneman said. Dr. Tversky was born on March 16, 1937, in Haifa in what was then the British protectorate of Palestine. He fought in three Middle East wars, in 1956, 1967 and 1973, winning Israel's highest honor for bravery in a 1956 border skirmish.
Dr. Kahneman said Dr. Tversky rescued a soldier who had gone forward with an explosive charge to blow up some barbed wire and frozen, lying down on top of the explosive after lighting the fuse. He said Dr. Tversky reached the man and threw him to safety but was wounded.
Dr. Tversky got his bachelor's degree from Hebrew University in 1961 and his doctorate from the University of Michigan in 1965. He won many awards, including a MacArthur Foundation fellowship in 1984.
In addition to his wife, he is survived by two sons, Oren, of San Francisco, and Tal, of Stanford; a daughter, Dona, of Stanford, and a sister, Ruth Ariel, of Jerusalem.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
A new rating of economies holds some surprises.

BYLINE: By Robin D. Schatz 

 BODY:
INDIVIDUALS compete. Corporations compete. But do whole economies compete? Writing in Foreign Affairs magazine two years ago, Paul Krugman of Stanford University labeled the idea "a dangerous obsession" used to rationalize government intervention on behalf of special interests and, more specifically, to justify trade protectionism.
He was not the only mainstream economist to reject the competition metaphor. And the World Economic Forum, a Swiss-based foundation underwritten by big business that has published an annual "competitiveness report" since 1979, took the criticism to heart. The organization dropped its association with the Institute for Management and Development in Lausanne, Switzerland, and turned to Jeffrey Sachs, director of the Harvard Institute for International Development, for a make-over. "We wanted to take a second look at the competitiveness debate, as well as to give our members more practical information about investment opportunities," said Lobna Freih, a spokeswoman for the forum. 
 While "The Global Competitiveness Report 1996," just published, is unlikely to silence all the skeptics, it does bend the idea of competitiveness to fit modern growth theory. Most intriguing, of course, is the new, improved list showing which countries have the right stuff.
In previous competitiveness reports, economies were ranked by a blizzard of criteria, with some (gross domestic product, foreign capital inflows) looking suspiciously like the effect of whatever was meant by competitiveness rather than the cause. In the latest, Mr. Sachs formally defines competitiveness as "the ability of a nation's economy to make rapid and sustained gains in living standards." This fits the common-sense Darwinian concept of capacity to thrive in a global economic environment, yet avoids the misleading "zero sum game" aspect of the competition metaphor in which one county's success must come at the expense of others.
Next Mr. Sachs pruned away the most subjective inputs in the "competitiveness index," putting more weight on such objective measures as average tariff rates, savings as a percentage of G.D.P. and numbers of telephone lines per capita. Where objectivity was not possible, the report used the findings from surveys of international business executives so that assessments of the "security of property rights" and "international experience of senior management" were at least grounded on the perceptions of many, rather than on the hunches of a handful of researchers.
And the winners? Singapore ranks first, with Hong Kong, New Zealand, the United States, Luxembourg and Switzerland following. Russia is the caboose of the 49 economies rated, with Brazil, Venezuela, Hungary and India helping to pull up the rear.
A number of patterns are evident here. First, with the exceptions of the United States and New Zealand, the top-ranked countries have "small and very open economies that specialize in providing trade and financial services to the world."
Another group, "Anglo Saxon" economies -- New Zealand (ranked No. 3), United States (4), Canada (8), Australia (12) and Britain (15) -- do far better than one might expect. Mr. Sachs attributes this to their flexibility, not to mention their resistance to the bear hug of social democracy and the accompanying inclination to solve every problem with state intervention.
The Asian miracle economies rank highly, but perhaps not as well as their last few decades of supersonic growth would suggest. Taiwan (9), is followed by Malaysia (10), Thailand (14) and South Korea (20). Many affluent economies do relatively poorly: Japan (13), the Netherlands (17), Germany (22) and France (23) are clustered in the middle. "This relatively low ranking reflects in part the fiscal, financial and employment problems now confronting the social welfare states of Europe," the report concludes.
The key to these new rankings is remembering that they are driven by a strong theoretical vision. The index is intended to predict future capacity for growth, not celebrate past success. In effect, the Sachs researchers are betting that long-term growth largely turns on openness to trade, commitment to free markets, investment in technology and human skills, rule by law and stability. From this perspective, some economies that have done relatively well in recent years will either have to shape up or eventually accept mediocrity. At the top of this warning list is China (36). Indonesia (30), the Czech Republic (35) and Italy (41) would presumably share China's fate.
Those who want a second opinion can, fittingly, turn to the competition. The Institute for Management and Development is churning out its own ratings, with the United States first, Japan fourth and Germany 10th. For more, check the institute's website (http://www.imd.ch).

HEADLINE: County Says Sale of Bonds Is Successful

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE 

 BODY:
In a deal that will lift it from bankruptcy, Orange County, Calif., sold nearly $900 million in bonds yesterday to a forgiving market -- but at a price.
The bonds were priced at a premium of as much as one-fifth of a percentage point over prevailing interest rates and were offered with insurance to enable them to attract buyers. While the bonds' sellers declared the sale a rousing success, others said that the premium would be costly to the county. 
 The bonds are being issued to pay holders of Orange County notes and vendors who have been forced to wait to get repaid after the county's bankruptcy filing nearly 18 months ago. The filing, the biggest municipal bankruptcy in history, came after the county suffered a $1.6 billion loss after making risky investments with municipal funds.
"Over all, its's been a huge success," Michael D. McCarthy, a partner at Goldman, Sachs & Company, said of yesterday's bond sale. "The county is very happy with the results and is thrilled to be headed out of bankruptcy." The deal was managed by Goldman and by A. G. Edwards & Sons.
Still, the market extracted its price. "I think that the premium is large for an insured bond," said William Fitzgerald, a portfolio manager at John Nuveen & Company, a mutual fund company. "Clearly the market is penalizing the county for its past transgressions and for the risk that the county will act without integrity in the future."
Part of the attractiveness of the bonds, in fact, was that they offered buyers a rare combination of insurance and high returns. The sale was a sign not only of market forgiveness, but also of the strides Orange County has taken in straightening out its tangled finances.
"It's not only the insurance but the perception that Orange County is a sound county, even with its problems," said Richard Visconti, a trader with W. R. Lazard Laidlaw & Mead Inc., a New York municipal bond broker. "And basically people see this as an opportunity to pick up bonds at a better level than they normally would have."
The insurance for the debt securities -- $756 million in tax-free bonds and $123 million in taxable bonds -- was provided by MBIA Inc. The insurance cost the county about $29 million. It has been estimated by some analysts that the extra yield on the bonds and the insurance would cost the county $40 million to $45 million extra to bring the deal to market.
The bonds also drew interest because they were backed by a unique repayment structure. Sales taxes and motor-vehicle license fees will be diverted from Orange County and given to the State of California for distribution to the bondholders. The funds will be automatically intercepted by the state and cannot be touched by the county.
Orange County plans to emerge from bankruptcy on Wednesday, after using proceeds from yesterday's sale to pay off its remaining creditors. The bankruptcy-related debt was cut in half -- to about $800 million -- by a decision of many municipalities in Orange County to forgive repayment on money they lost in the county investment pool.
Chris Varelas, a Salomon Brothers banker who serves as financial adviser to the county, said yesterday that county officials were pleased with the bond sale.
"The prices reflect the fact that we have an overall solution to the bankruptcy," Mr. Varelas said. "Of course, there were buyers who refused to participate. But we knew that certain buyers wouldn't partake of this issue. But the county was fortunate that there were enough investors who realized the strength of the county's credit and the way that this deal was structured to protect Orange County bondholders from any future fiscal stress."

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Kmart offers convertible stock, but only the brave need apply.

BYLINE: By Jennifer Steinhauer 

 BODY:
THE Kmart Corporation has been struggling for months to get its retail act together while easing its nettlesome debt obligations. And now it is hoping that investors will make that job even simpler.
Next week, Kmart is expected to go to market with a $750 million convertible bond issue priced at $50 a share. But while the company has much to gain from the sale, investors should consider the deal soberly. 
 Convertible securities are bonds that can be exchanged for the issuer's common stock at a set ratio. After 12 painful quarters of losses, Kmart decided to sell the securities to raise to pay off outstanding debts, buy Christmas inventory and get its balance sheet in better shape.
Knowing that the consistently weak performance of its common stock would engender little appetite for yet more, it decided to go the convertible way, offering investors entree into Kmart equities without all the risks, and a little bit of cash in the form of interest.
Further, the convertible offering gives the company a break at tax time, as the interest payments are deductible, while giving them the advantage of having a security that the rating agencies consider an equity. That means it will not get the below-investment-grade rating that the agencies have given to all of Kmart's bonds.
They have made the deal look tasty: the interest rate is expected to be around 7 3/4 percent, which is an attractive rate for convertibles. In addition, the bonds can be converted to Kmart stock after the stock price rises 18 percent to 20 percent, which analysts consider a good conversion rate.
Kmart, based in Troy, Mich., has further incentive to offer a blue light special -- it became obligated to sell $750 million in securities last month as part of its agreement with Chase Manhattan, which provided $3.7 billion in credit to the ailing discount chain.
The loan, which replaced all other previous Kmart bank lines, is backed by liens on assets owned by the company. The liens will disappear only when Kmart pays back roughly $1 billion and meets certain financial targets, or when its credit ratings are increased to investment-grade levels.
Here is where things get sticky. If Kmart does not meet the performance targets, which include a tightening of its capitalization and earnings ratios and a limit on some of its spending, Chase can can pull the plug. And in the event of a bankruptcy, bond holders would be subordinate to Chase.
Not only that, but bond holders must also get in line behind Kmart's vendors, who were given priority as a means of comforting the nervous among them who do not want to be burned in the event of a liquidity crisis.
During previous hard times, banks that had made unsecured loans tended to give Kmart extra breathing room, so that they would not be left holding the bag. But as the secured creditor under the new loan agreement, there is less incentive for Chase to do so.
Kmart's prospectus also says that the company has the right to defer interest payments on the convertible by extending the payment period "at any time, from time to time."
The deferral alone would be annoying. But in addition, under the terms of the offering, investors would be obligated to pay taxes on money that they were in fact not touching. Kmart executives say they have every intention of paying their interest, but if they should ever stop, that clearly will not have a positive effect on the price of the bonds.
All of this would sound like Cassandra's wails if Kmart's turnaround strategy were guaranteed. But while the new management team has set the company on a better path, earnings continue to disappoint, the competition in the discount business remains as fierce as ever and Kmart's increased sales have been at the expense of margins, a trend that is likely to continue as more low-cost goods are trucked to the stores in an effort to build traffic.
Indeed, several holders of Kmart's other debt have been quietly selling it off to secondary markets.
"I wouldn't touch this deal," said Warren Bree, the senior portfolio manager at WHB/Wolverine Asset Management in Stamford, Conn. "It would take a modern miracle to turn this whole company around."
So for those enticed by the yummy rates, this could be a sweet buy. But it is not for the weak of stomach. As Carol Levenson, the editor of the bond newsletter Gimme Credit, put it: "This is where we let the gamblers take over."

HEADLINE: Disney Plans To Open Store In Harlem

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
The Disney Company, lending its clout and world-famous name to a plan for an entertainment and retail project in the heart of Harlem, said yesterday that it would open a store in the long-delayed Harlem USA complex.
Disney, which has been expanding rapidly in New York City with several new Disney Stores and its renovation of the New Amsterdam Theater on 42d Street, said the complex at 125th Street and Frederick Douglass Boulevard was a logical site for its next new Manhattan venture. 
 The developers of Harlem USA plan a multiplex cinema, a health club, a rooftop skating rink and several other stores, making it the largest retail complex and biggest commercial employer in Harlem, with 500 workers.
"Harlem USA's diverse demographics, along with its plan to combine retail and entertainment, make it a natural," said Thomas A. Heymann, president of the company's retail division, The Disney Store Worldwide. "Opening a store on Harlem's main commercial thoroughfare is a win-win situation for both the Disney Store and the community."
He added that the company would recruit its store managers and staff from Harlem.
Still, even with its commitment from Disney, Harlem USA, with an estimated cost of $56 million, has not received bank financing that will be necessary before construction begins. As in other large commercial projects, banks have refused to extend loans to the Harlem complex until tenants commit to more than half its space. But officials involved in the project said they hoped Disney's commitment would help attract both private and public financing for the project.
"Every time we sign on another tenant we move closer," said Drew Greenwald president of Grid Properties, the Harlem USA developer. He said Disney's announcement would prompt other retailers to commit themselves to the project.
Bank financing should be obtained by the fall, with construction beginning by the end of the year, Mr. Greenwald said.
Disney's announcement yesterday came two months after Cineplex Odeon, the theater chain, said it was planning to operate a multiplex theater in Harlem USA, giving the project the imprimatur of a large entertainment company for the first time.
Although Cineplex Odeon has not completed its final negotiations and signed a lease for space in Harlem USA, Mr. Greenwald said yesterday that he expected the company to do so -- for a theater with 10 to 12 screens -- within 30 days.
The Disney Store planned for the project, with 6,000 square feet of space, would be far smaller than others the company has opened or has under construction in Manhattan. A store it opened in May at Fifth Avenue and 57th Street has 40,000 square feet, making it the largest of 480 Disney Stores around the world.
Despite the relatively small size of the store, New York State officials said yesterday that Disney's announcement was a important endorsement of the project that would help it qualify for a $5.6 million state loan.
Harlem USA is the largest of more than a dozen proposed commercial developments in Harlem and other low-income neighborhoods that have applied for low-interest loans to be made available from $25 million in state funds. That money was set aside a year ago when the state withdrew its support of the International Trade Center, another project had been planned in Harlem.
"Disney is a very important factor in this project," said Charles Gargano, chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, which will determine which projects get the state financing. "It looks like a project we will fund."
Nonetheless, he added that Harlem USA's application to the state will not be approved until it has obtained commitments from more tenants and for bank financing.
Although Disney said it was planning its store in the Harlem complex without any tax or other financial incentives that the city and state have used to lure or retain other companies, it does stand to benefit from Federal subsidies.
That is because the site of Harlem USA is included in a Federal Economic Empowerment Zone, created a year ago, that covers sections of Harlem and the South Bronx.
Under that program, Disney or any other company that leases space in Harlem USA would receive Federal tax credits worth up to $3,000 a year for each employee that it hires who lives in Harlem.
The Harlem USA project, which has been planned by Mr. Greenwald's company for four years, has prompted a mix of excitement and skepticism in the neighborhood since its inception, with some Harlem residents fearing that it would displace small businesses.
Interviews yesterday with people on 125th Street suggested that Disney's announcement did little to bridge the differing opinions.
"People would like to see redevelopment, but I still want it to be Harlem. Know what I am saying?" said William Hamer, who lives on 145th Street. "I don't want to see Disney World or Epcot Center here."
But Jimmy Booker, a columnist for The Amsterdam News, said Harlem USA had gained widespread support among residents of Harlem who are under 50 years old.
"We are a different generation, the baby boom generation, and we want a first-class store here," he said. "Of course, we want there to be black-owned business, but Harlem has never been all black."

HEADLINE: Stocks Gain In Late Rally Tied to Bonds

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Stocks staged a late rebound yesterday, sending the Nasdaq index to a record close as bonds climbed on short-covering and commodity prices slumped.
"Any kind of news suggesting inflation is indeed not a problem would cause short-covering in bonds," said Thom Brown, a managing director of Rutherford Brown & Catherwood. "The bond market picked up and stocks tagged along." 
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 31.77 points, or nearly six-tenths of 1 percent, to 5,697.48. Broader indexes were also higher.
The Standard & Poor's composite of 500 stocks rose 5.88 points, closing at 678.44, just shy of the record 678.51 set May 24. The Nasdaq composite rose 5.47, to 1,249.15, topping the previous high of 1,248.65 set May 23. But the Dow remained well off its record closing high of 5,778, set May 22.
Late stock buying was stoked by firmer Treasuries prices. The 30-year Treasury bond rose nearly half a point, knocking its yield to 6.95 percent from the psychologically important 7 percent level at Tuesday's close. Bond prices were bolstered by a decline in crude oil and copper prices on commodities markets. The drop in crude oil prices dragged shares of some oil companies lower.
Shares of Chevron slipped 3/4 to 58 7/8, Atlantic Richfield fell 1 5/8, to 118 5/8, and American depository receipts of British Petroleum, with each A.D.R. representing 12 ordinary shares, slid 3/8, to 105 3/4. But Texaco edged up 1/4, to 84 1/4.
Gold prices were also lower yesterday as gold for August delivery fell $1.90, to $388.90, on the Commodity Exchange of New York. Among gold stocks, Barrick Gold was off 1 3/8, to 29 3/8, and Newmont Mining was down 3 1/4, to 54.
Despite the active stock buying in the last hour of trading, Bill Meehan, a market analyst at Prudential Securities, said investors were "loath to take aggressive positions ahead of Friday's May jobs report." He expected an even quieter session today.
Mr. Brown said drug stocks were among the strong points in yesterday's trading. Merck added 1, to 66 1/8, Eli Lilly rose 7/8, to 66 1/4 and Pfizer was up 2 1/8, to 74 1/4.
But shares of the drug makers Cephalon and Chiron fell after Smith Barney repeated concern that the two companies' drug for treating Lou Gherig's disease might be rejected by a Food and Drug Administration advisory panel Friday. Cephalon shares fell 3 11/16, to 23, and Chiron fell 5 7/8, to 97 7/8.
U.S. Surgical lost 2 1/2, to 32. The company said it had received a warning letter from Federal regulators on its newly introduced ABBI biopsy system.
America Online lost 5 3/8, to 47 5/8, after Montgomery Securities cut its rating to hold from buy, apparently determining that prospects for the company were diminished as Internet access became easier.
Wackenhut Corrections surged 6 1/2, to 44 3/4, after the company announced its second new contract in two days.
Registry, which provides information technology consultants to companies with complex information systems, soared 12, to 29, in its market debut.
Another initial public offering, Titanium Metals, rose 2 3/4, to 25 3/4.
Lam Research, a maker of semiconductor manufacturing equipment, warned that earnings in the quarter ending June 30 would be about 4 percent to 5 percent below analysts' estimates because of a slowdown in sales. Its shares fell 3 1/4, to 34.

HEADLINE: Census Plan For 2000 Is Challenged On 2 Fronts

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 5

 BODY:
Three months after it introduced revolutionary plans for improving the nation's head count in the year 2000, the Census Bureau is being challenged by minority groups and some Republicans.
The minority groups say the new technique planned by the bureau would worsen, not lessen, the problem of undercounting the nation's black and Hispanic population, and the Republicans say this technique would result in improperly drawn legislative districts. 
 Last week Representative Carrie P. Meek, Democrat of Florida, who is black, introduced a bill that would forbid the Census Bureau to proceed with its plan: to count at least 90 percent of the households in each county and then use statistical sampling methods to estimate the number missed. She proposed an alternative statistical method for estimating the nation's uncounted population.
And today Representative Tom Petri, Republican of Wisconsin, introduced legislation that would prohibit the Census Bureau from applying sampling techniques of any kind to determine a population count. Mr. Petri said the bureau should do whatever it takes to obtain an accurate count without relying on sampling.
The twin challenges to the bureau's plans add to the burdens on an agency that is under pressure to increase the accuracy of the next census, hold down costs and at the same time respond to concerns of lawmakers who control its budget, who generally have little understanding of statistical methods and whose districts are drawn on the basis of its work.
The Census Bureau has acknowledged that the 1990 census left many Americans uncounted, particularly members of minority groups who live in central cities. In that census,the number of blacks uncounted was six times greater than the number of uncounted whites, the largest undercount differential since 1940.
It was to correct such undercounts that the bureau decided to use a sampling method for the first time to determine the nation's official population. But critics of the proposal say it could result in an even larger minority undercount.
Ms. Meek, for one, argues that under the bureau's plans, census takers in a county containing a minority-dominated city and predominantly white suburbs might reach the 90 percent threshold by counting virtually all the white suburbanites but a much lower percentage of the minority inner-city dwellers. Should that occur, statisticians agree, there will be a greater chance for error in estimating the missed minority population than in estimating the uncounted whites.
Ms. Meek's bill, which has been endorsed by 34 of the 37 Democratic members of the Congressional Black Caucus, would require the Census Bureau to count 90 percent of the households in each census tract -- a geographical unit that is much smaller and tends to be more nearly homogeneous ethnically than a county -- and then use statistical sampling methods to estimate the missed population within the tract. Such a change would add $100 million to the cost of the 2000 census, already estimated at $3.9 billion.
Officials of the Commerce Department, the Census Bureau's parent, have responded to Ms. Meek's bill by saying they can accept census tracts, rather than counties, as the basic statistical unit. But in an effort to hold down costs, the Administration is also considering a reduction, to below 90 percent, in the proportion of each tract's households that census takers would have to count before shifting to scientific sampling.
"We're investigating how that trade-off looks," said Everett C. Ehrlich, the Under Secretary of Commerce for Economics and Statistics Administration. "We're investigating what the trade-off would be for accuracy at the national, state and Congressional district level."
But it is an open question whether counting fewer people, and estimating the number of more of them, will gain acceptance from Republicans and rural-district lawmakers in Congress, who have generally looked askance at the use of any sampling to determine the nation's population.
In 1990, Census Bureau officials tried to use statistical sampling to adjust its official count and so lessen the undercount of minorities. But that effort was blocked by Robert Mosbacher, who was then Secretary of Commerce.
In March, the Supreme Court rejected a challenge, brought by New York and other big cities, maintaining that Mr. Mosbacher had exceeded his constitutional authority. Among those defending Mr. Mosbacher's action was the State of Wisconsin, Mr. Petri's home, which would have lost one Congressional seat had the adjustment to the 1990 census been made.

HEADLINE: Aid Plan That Inspired Clinton Is a Success

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, June 5

 BODY:
In proposing a $1,500 tax credit for college tuition on Tuesday, President Clinton cited as his inspiration an ambitious Georgia scholarship program that is so popular many political analysts view it as the reason Gov. Zell Miller won a second term.
What is subject to debate is how much Mr. Clinton's plan borrows from the Georgia program, the most ambitious of its kind in the nation, and how much it reflects merely the name and politics. 
 Financed entirely by a state lottery and known as the Hope Scholarship Program, the Georgia arrangement offers a free college education to all Georgia students who earn a B average in high school and choose to attend a public college, university or technical institute in Georgia.
Those who choose a private institution receive an annual $3,000 scholarship. Since the program's inception in 1993, 191,300 students have taken advantage of it. For the 1996-1997 school year, $159 million in lottery revenue has been appropriated for 124,000 scholarship recipients.
Mr. Miller, a political ally of Mr. Clinton, said that he and the President had long discussed ways to make college affordable and that Mr. Clinton's initiative was a classic case of a government program to address fundamental voter concerns.
"Sure, it's been politically popular here and the reason it has is that it's something that families and parents can see and touch and understand," Mr. Miller said in a telephone interview today. "When families sit around the kitchen table, they're not talking about gays in the military or prayer in school. They're talking about things like whether they can afford to send Junior to college."
But some Georgia Republicans, while acknowledging the enormous popularity of Mr. Miller's program, say Mr. Clinton has embraced only the symbolism of the program.
"President Clinton's plan bears no resemblance to Governor Miller's, despite representations to the contrary," said Whit Ayers, a Republican political consultant. "It's classic Clinton. He says, 'I have in my hand two apples,' and you have to say, 'No, sir, you have an apple and an orange,' and then it comes down to, 'Is so. Is not. Is so. Is not.' "
Mr. Clinton proposed what he called Hope Scholarships, which would provide two-year $1,500 tax credits for the families of college students. For the first year of college, a tax credit would be available to the families of all students. But the students would need to maintain a 2.75-grade-point average and stay free of felony drug convictions to earn the second-year credit.
The Georgia program had its genesis in Mr. Miller's successful 1990 gubernatorial campaign, managed by James Carville, the consultant who was a prime architect of Mr. Clinton's 1992 campaign. Mr. Miller's overriding issue was a state lottery to finance educational programs. The main element became the Hope Scholarship Program.
In the current academic year, the program paid for the education of 43,150 students at public colleges and 43,840 at public technical institutions and provided stipends for 29,640 at private colleges. Students must maintain a cumulative B average to keep receiving the scholarship.
About 35,000 of nearly 60,000 high school graduates had B averages last year, officials said. A change in the program that goes into effect next fall says all courses counting toward the B average must be academic courses like English, math or science. A recent study found that 44 percent of last year's freshmen would not have qualified if their grade point average had been based only on core academic subjects.
The program was popular from the start, and most political experts say it could have easily swayed enough Republican-leaning suburban voters to have meant the difference in Mr. Miller's 120,000-vote re-election victory 1994.
Merle Black, a professor of politics and government at Emory University, said Mr. Miller's program was a political masterwork.
"He'll go down in history with this," Professor Black said. "He figured out a way to finance the education of talented youngsters, and he's paying for it without directly taxing the citizens of the state."
The lottery, he said, was largely paid for by lower-income people who tend not to vote, while the scholarships overwhelmingly went to high-achieving students and better-educated residents who tend to be reliable voters.
But there has been little controversy over who pays for the program and who benefits. Of 16,376 freshmen at public institutions last year, 76 percent were white or Hispanic and 20 percent were black. Whites make up 71 percent of the state population, blacks 27 percent and Hispanics 1.7 percent. Median household income for the Hope recipients was $44,876. For the state it was $29,021.
Mr. Black said Mr. Clinton could not hope to duplicate a program offering as much at so little perceived cost as Mr. Miller's program. But he added that he thought Mr. Clinton's program had considerable appeal.
"I think this is a winner for the President," he said. "It addresses a tangible economic issue in terms of using government funds as an investment rather than simply as a subsidy, much like the G.I. bill."
Mr. Ayers, the Republican consultant, said that unlike Mr. Miller's program, Mr. Clinton's plan was "a tax increase in disguise."
"I think resistance to tax increases is so great among middle-class families and all Americans that any program that relies on a tax increase is a loser," he said.
Education experts were generally split on Mr. Clinton's plan. Most agreed that it was an attempt to address widespread and realistic worries about the affordability of higher education. But some were skeptical that broad-based tax credits were the way to approach it.
"If there's $25 billion to invest in addressing this problem," said Lawrence Galdieux, executive director for policy analysis at the College Board in Washington, "I would put it into student aid programs, direct expenditure programs."

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE HOUSE;
In a Volatile District, a Battle for the Center

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON 

DATELINE: EVANSVILLE, Ind., May 30

 BODY:
 Here in the middle of small-town America, sudden moves and loud styles tend to raise eyebrows. And that seems to go for politics, too.
"These are people who don't like extreme anything," said Don Freeman, who has taught political science at Evansville University for the better part of three decades. "They want sane, sensible, Everyman, middle-of-the-road." 
 Just who stands for the hallowed mainstream, and who can be unmasked as an extremist, will surely frame the debate in November between Representative John Hostettler, a freshman Republican, and Jonathan Weinzapfel, the Democrat challenger.
Mr. Hostettler, who has strong support among evangelical Christians, won the seat two years ago after painting the Democratic incumbent, Frank X. McCloskey, as being far too liberal for the everyday Hoosier.
This time around Mr. Hostettler faces criticism as being on the fringe himself -- more conservative even than Speaker Newt Gingrich.
Earlier this year Mr. Hostettler defied the Speaker, and then publicly disavowed Mr. Gingrich's support by voting against a compromise with the White House to end the shutdown of part of the Federal Government.
Even now, five months before Election Day, organized labor has been running television advertisements that portray Mr. Hostettler as hostile to the interests of the elderly.
One television station here, WEVV, pulled the advertisements, saying they were inaccurate in accusing Mr. Hostettler of voting to cut Medicare spending. In fact, under the Republican plan that Mr. Hostettler supported, spending for Medicare would increase, but at a slower rate than would be necessary to maintain current services, given inflation in medical costs and the increase in beneficiaries each year.
Mr. Weinzapfel, a former aide to Mr. McCloskey and now a public relations manager for an Evansville bank, has accused Mr. Hostettler of supporting policies that Mr. Weinzapfel said would "divide us into a nation of haves and have-nots."
For his part, Mr. Hostettler, 34, has vowed to continue a relentless attack on the Federal debt, which he has said amounts to "theft from our children."
Although Mr. McCloskey held office for 12 years, it was never deemed a safe seat. Indeed, the 1984 vote ended with a recount that failed to clarify the outcome. Ultimately, he was seated by a Democratic-controlled task force in Congress as Republicans shouted foul.
Indiana's Eighth Congressional District, sometimes called the Bloody Eighth, is one of the most strongly contested districts in America. In the 1970's, voters here elected four different Congressmen in four different elections, the only district in the nation to do so.
At least part of the reason for the volatility, Indiana political experts say, is the unusual mix of voter backgrounds. Despite its rather monochromatic look, this is a district with large voting blocs that have broadly diverse views.
The district, which covers most of southwestern Indiana, includes labor union populists at the big Whirlpool factory in Evansville, Christian conservatives who oppose abortion and support school prayer, alternative-minded Indiana University professors in Bloomington, and back-country farmers, some of them barely eking out a living and some more wealthy than any merchant on Main Street.
"It's going to come down to good old-fashioned politics," said William Blomquist, an associate professor of political science at the Indianapolis campus of Indiana University. "You identify your supporters, round them up, get them to the polls and hope you win."
The Bible Belt influence is as strong in this part of the Midwest as anywhere in the South. Professor Freeman, a native of North Carolina, described the southwestern corner of Indiana as "more Southern than anywhere in the South."
Christian conservatives have tended to rally round certain issues, like school prayer, homosexuality and abortion, rather than candidates. But Mr. Hostettler, an evangelical Christian himself, attracted strong support among these voters in 1994, perhaps enough to make the difference in his victory over Mr. McCloskey.
As many as 40 percent of voters in southwestern Indiana identify themselves as Christian conservatives, according to Professor Freeman. And many of these voters have volunteered as foot soldiers in a Hostettler re-election campaign that is formidable for its organization.
"We're able to turn out lots of people," said Mr. Hostettler's campaign manager, Chris Crabtree. "At a Labor Day rally in Boonville during the last campaign, we had 200 supporters, all wearing red Hostettler T-shirts. That's unprecedented in a small town."
Both sides say they will be assiduously courting the Roman Catholic vote, which has historically leaned Democratic but has been drifting to Republicans in Presidential campaigns for the last 20 or 30 years.
Socially conservative but more moderate on economic issues, the Catholic vote is heaviest in Evansville, the district's largest city. Mr. Weinzapfel, a Catholic, has clearly tried to reach out to more conservative voters.
Indiana is so solidly Republican that Presidential candidates rarely campaign here. Democrats have been much more successful in Congressional races, especially in the southern part of the state. In the Ninth Congressional District in southeastern Indiana, Lee Hamilton, a Democrat, has held his seat for 30 years -- although he had a scare in 1994, when he was re-elected with only 52 percent of the vote.
For television advertising, Mr. Weinzapfel will need financial help from the national Democratic Party. But he will also need to show some ideological distance between himself and his party leaders in Washington, who are perceived here as being too liberal.
As a neophyte taking on an incumbent, Mr. Weinzapfel must be rated as the underdog. But he demonstrated no little measure of political savvy in winning the Democratic nomination over the party leadership's favored candidate, State Representative Richard McConnell. Mr. Weinzapfel also succeded in toppling the party chairman of Vanderburgh County.
"You don't very often fool with party leaders in Indiana, or you come back with busted kneecaps," Professor Freeman said. "But he took them on, and won."

HEADLINE: G.M. Names An Executive For Saab Unit

BYLINE: By MICHELLE KREBS 

DATELINE: DETROIT, June 5

 BODY:
In a further sign of its eagerness to capitalize on the lessons learned at its Saturn division, the General Motors Corporation is set to appoint another Saturn executive to a ranking position.
Joel K. Manby, a regional manager for Saturn in the Midwest, will be named president and chief executive of Saab Cars USA Inc., effective Thursday. The unit is the United States importer and distributor of cars made by Saab Automobile A.B. of Sweden, in which G.M. owns a half- interest. Mr. Manby will replace James P. Crumlish, who has been Saab's top executive in the United States for six years. G.M. said Mr. Crumlish would be assigned to another corporate post. 
 Mr. Manby, who is 36, was an early employee of Saturn, which G.M. started in 1985. He left the company in 1987 to run Saturn dealerships for Team Management, a $400 million chain of automobile dealerships based in Grand Blanc, Mich. He returned to General Motors in 1994, and to Saturn last year.
Mr. Manby joins the roster of Saturn executives who have moved to key positions within G.M. Most visible is John Middlebrook, a vice president of sales, service and marketing at Saturn, who was recently promoted to general manager of the Chevrolet division. David Krysiek, now Saab's director of marketing, once worked for Saturn as well.
Saturn executives have also been placed within G.M.'s new brand-management structure, at its British subsidiary Vauxhall Motors Ltd. and in the company's manufacturing and engineering operations.
John Orth, Saturn's director of consumer marketing, will join Saab on Monday as vice president of sales and retail network development, a new position.
Mr. Manby said his goal was to replicate Saturn's successful sales, marketing and distribution methods at Saab, which returned to overall profitability in 1994 after a six-year slump. Saab sales in the U.S. this year are off by about 8 percent while other European makers, most notably BMW and Mercedes-Benz, are setting records.
"As a whole, Saab's distribution network is not a strength," Mr. Manby said.
Analysts were encouraged by the move. "Clearly, if they can Saturnize the Saab franchise, it can only do positive things for Saab," said Joseph Phillippi, an analyst at Lehman Brothers.
Saab has been rated below-average in customer service surveys conducted by J. D. Power & Associates, an automotive market research firm. Mr. Manby said Saab customers would get the kind of pampering that earned Saturn its reputation.
Saab may also adopt Saturn's flat-rate price policy. And Saab will examine "dualing," the practice of putting more than one vehicle marque in a single showroom, which Saturn does not allow.

HEADLINE: GLOOMY FORECAST TOUCHES OFF FEUD ON MEDICARE FUND

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 5

 BODY:
An official Government report today confirmed that the Medicare system was running out of money faster than ever, setting off a new round of political backbiting.
Republicans used the annual report of the trustees of the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund to attack President Clinton anew for vetoing budget legislation last year that would have put the program on a sounder financial footing. 
 "That Medicare is going bankrupt is not the news of the day," declared Haley Barbour, the Republican Party chairman. "That Bill Clinton has allowed it to happen is."
Democrats responded that Republicans wanted to gut the Medicare program to raise money for a tax cut for the wealthy. "Their goal," said Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic leader in the House, "has been to raid Medicare, not to save it -- to lavish more tax breaks on the very people who don't need them."
The trustees -- three members of the Clinton Cabinet, the Commissioner of Social Security and two nongovernmental experts on the subject -- reported that unless the law was changed to raise more revenue or hold down costs, the trust fund that pays the hospital bills for the elderly and disabled would go into the red in 2001, one year earlier than they forecast last year.
The finding came as no surprise, having been telegraphed by Administration officials at a Congressional hearing in February and documented in a recent assessment by the Congressional Budget Office.
The hospital insurance trust fund, Part A of Medicare, is financed by a 2.9-percent payroll tax divided equally between workers and their employers. Part B, which covers doctor bills and other outpatient expenses, is financed in part by monthly insurance premiums but mostly by general Government revenues. Its solvency is not now in question.
The latest figures show expenditures under Part A are growing so rapidly that the trust fund, which now has a surplus of $121 billion, will be almost depleted by 2000 and will run a deficit of $53 billion in 2001 unless changes are made.
Donna E. Shalala, Secretary of Health and Human Services, said the forecast had become worse in the last year because of higher costs than expected for home health care, skilled nursing and hospices; because hospitals were performing more expensive procedures and because revenues were lower than expected.
But the immediate financial condition of the program is not nearly so dire as it might seem. Competing proposals for a short-term fix by the White House and Congressional Republicans are similar in their basics. A compromise could be reached if the two sides found it in their political interest. Politicians and scholars have no doubt that a solution will be found before the trust fund is exhausted.
"The differences between the Democrats and the Republicans are not that great," said Stuart H. Altman, an economist at Brandeis University who specializes in health policy. "I'm sure they will be dealt with quite quickly next year no matter who is elected."
The real problem in the view of Mr. Altman and many other students of the situation -- one that few politicians in either party are addressing -- will arise in about 2010. That is when the baby-boom generation will begin to retire. Without fundamental changes in the Medicare system or onerous taxes on younger workers, there will not be enough money to finance health care for retirees.
But even though the findings released today were expected, the partisan bickering was unallayed.
Representative Bill Archer of Texas, the Republican chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, called a news conference to say the new numbers showed that the financial status of Medicare had seriously deteriorated in the last year. "Medicare is going broke, and the cost of last year's veto is profound," he said.
The White House strategy was to try to appear reasonable. President Clinton urged Republicans to sit down with him and work out a bipartisan agreement. "We have the ability right now to put 10 years on the life of that trust fund, and we ought to just do it," he said. "The differences in our numbers are not that dramatic."
But the President's supporters refused to concede that the program must undergo basic changes. Asked at a news conference whether retirees might be facing fewer services or higher costs under Medicare, Dr. Shalala replied, "Absolutely not."
In a separate report, the trustees found that the Social Security Trust Fund, which finances retirement and disability benefits, will be solvent without changes until 2029.
After examining the two reports, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, observed that next year, for the first time, the total amount the Government spends for Social Security and Part A of Medicare would exceed the amount of revenue raised from payroll taxes.
In addition to Dr. Shalala, the trustees are Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich, Social Security Commissioner Shirley S. Chater and two experts from outside the Government, Stephen G. Kellison, an actuary, and Marilyn Moon, an economist who specializes in health policy.

4 Doors and Air, but No Heat

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: TOKYO, June 5

 BODY:
Though the Honda Motor Company's new City subcompact is priced to fit the pocketbooks of Asia's emerging middle class, is designed to withstand the pounding of Asia's muddy roads and is being assembled in Thailand, the company refuses to call it an "Asia car." Engineers who utter the forbidden words have to contribute money to the office coffee pool.
Why is Honda being so coy? Simple: it does not want buyers in the world's fastest-growing car market to think they are being short-changed with a stripped-down version of the Civic or other cars that Honda sells to more affluent customers at home and in the West. 
 The company took pains to give the City the fashionably squared contours of its fancier cars. "We don't want it to look cheap," said Tomoyuki Sugiyama, Honda's executive chief engineer. "In some ways, it looks better than the Civic."
Whatever Honda calls it, however, others call the City an "Asia car." And such vehicles are the latest weapons in the battle among the world's car makers for a region that is shaping up to be the most promising market of the late 1990's and early 21st century. From Bombay to Beijing and all across Southeast Asia, exploding economic growth is creating legions of first-time car buyers. Excluding Japan and South Korea, two relatively mature markets, sales of new vehicles in East Asia surged 17 percent last year, to four million.
That is only about one quarter the size of the United States market and a little more than half the size of Japan's. But while sales are stagnant in the richer countries, they are expected to double by the year 2000 in Asia, making it the land of opportunity and a gateway to the rest of the developing world.
So far, most companies continue to sell their existing models to Asia. But some, like Honda, are trying to gain an edge by designing a car tailored to the region's social habits and geographic traits -- a car cheap enough for $3,000-a-year salaries, roomy enough for families with several children, sturdy enough for rocky mountain roads, practical enough to eliminate unnecessary features like heaters and yet sleek enough to look like it belongs in a suburban American driveway.
Japanese companies are leading the way, hoping to cement their dominance in a region they regard as their backyard. "With the Asia cars, you have first-time buyers, and you know how important that is" for building brand loyalty, said Michael J. Dunne, the president of Automotive Resources Asia, a consulting and market research firm based in Bangkok, Thailand.
Besides Honda, whose City went on sale in Thailand in April, the Toyota Motor Corporation is developing what it calls the "affordable family car," which it will produce in Thailand starting next year; the Mitsubishi Motors Corporation plans a car that will double as a passenger carrier and delivery van, and the Nissan Motor Company already makes a wagon especially for Asia.
Though Japanese companies hold a 90 percent market share in some Southeast Asian nations, American, European and South Korean companies are in hot pursuit, as witnessed by the General Motors Corporation's decision last week to build a $750 million factory in Thailand. And Asia cars figure in the strategies of many of them.
The Chrysler Corporation is considering producing a mini-vehicle, priced at less than $7,000, to sell in China and India. And one reason the Ford Motor Company took effective control of Mazda recently was to exploit the Japanese company's expertise in designing small cars for Asia.
Success in Asia could open up markets elsewhere. Low-priced vehicles built to Japanese standards by cheap Asian labor could ultimately be big sellers in Africa, the Middle East and Latin America and perhaps even in wealthier Europe and North America. Mitsubishi, eager to escape the cost burden of the strong yen, is shifting all production of pickup trucks to Thailand; it will export them to the rest of the world.
But the race to Asia has risks. Horrendous congestion and air pollution in cities like Bangkok could hamper sales sooner than industry executives expect. Most Asian countries are trying to build up their own automobile industries, and many are requiring local manufacturing by foreign car makers. As a result, the factories in Asia are often small, economies of scale tend to be limited and profits are usually low -- and the possibility of oversupply is high.
Taiwan has 11 automobile assemblers, the same number as Japan, even though production is less than 5 percent of Japan's level. And Chrysler is shying away from an earlier plan to assemble vehicles in Vietnam because a dozen companies will be getting permission to serve a market of only 10,000 to 30,000 vehicles a year. "How do you go and produce 500 or 1,000 or 1,500 units?" said Denis Root, general manager of Asia-Pacific operations for Chrysler.
The definition of an Asia car is fuzzy. It can be a vehicle designed from the ground up for Asia, like Honda's City, or simply an existing model modified for Asian needs. Either way, the basic idea is to make a low-cost, no-frills machine that can take a lot of punishment from poor roads, floods and people crowding in. "It has to be designed to be overloaded pretty excessively," Mr. Root said. In India, he said, he once saw a three-wheel vehicle with a tiny, 200-cubic-centimeter engine carrying 19 people.
The Honda City is slightly smaller than the Civic, has a simpler suspension and has eliminated air bags, antilock brakes, heaters and rear-window defrosters. It does, however, have an extra air-conditioner vent to blow cool air into the back seat and provide relief from Southeast Asia's torrid climate. As a result of all this, the City sells for about $16,000, compared with the $23,000 price tag on a Civic in Thailand.
In addition, the City's ground clearance is higher than the Civic's because the roads in Southeast Asia are often rougher, and its engine-control computer is mounted higher to prevent flood damage.
Not all the adjustments for the Asian market make a car cheaper. Mitsubishi plans to give its Asia vehicle more interior space than a similar Japanese vehicle, in part to accommodate mothers getting in and out with their children, said Kohya Okamoto, managing director in charge of Asia and Oceania.
Similarly, Toyota's new Asia car -- based on its subcompact Tercel -- will be designed to carry a whole family. It will have a bigger engine and more luggage space than the Japanese model, and it will come only with four doors, instead of offering a choice of two doors or four, as in Japan.
The makers of Asia cars face the possibility that consumers will shun models if they suspect that the maker has cut corners on quality. "If they can afford a car in that society, they are middle class, and the middle class has an aspiration for the best and not yesterday's products," said Henry D. G. Wallace, who will become president of Mazda soon. Yet another concern for manufacturers is that any car tailor-made for Asia might deny them the economies of scale that could be gained by making a car with a broader appeal.
For all the risks, American companies are rushing into Asia. In addition to its planned factory in Thailand, G.M. last year won a contest for the rights to make passenger cars in China -- potentially the world's biggest market, and one where the Japanese are not entrenched. G.M. also operates small assembly plants in Indonesia and Taiwan. Ford is building a factory in Thailand with Mazda to make pickup trucks and perhaps also passenger cars. Ford is also constructing a big plant in India to make Fiestas and Escorts.
Though they are latecomers to the region, the Americans can hope to make inroads against the Japanese for historical and economic reasons. Most Asian countries restrict or even ban car imports to favor domestic manufacturing, often also requiring a certain percentage of parts used in the assembly to be locally made. Malaysia, for example, limits imports of G.M. cars to 80 a month. But the Japanese, having built cars in the region since the 1960's, have been largely insulated from competition by such protectionism.
Now, though, Asia's markets are starting to open, just as the strong yen is hurting the competitiveness of Japanese companies. While Japanese auto makers control virtually all of Thailand's truck market, for example, their share in passenger cars dropped to 71 percent last year from 83 percent in 1991.
And to the extent that Asian governments still meddle in markets, their goal now seems to be to dilute the influence of the Japanese. The Prime Minister of Malaysia, Mahathir Mohammad, has long complained that Mitsubishi had not been providing enough technology to Proton, a Malaysian car company in which Mitsubishi owns a stake, for example. And now there are two new car makers in Malaysia, one affiliated with the Daihatsu Motor Corporation of Japan and the other with Citroen, part of Peugeot S.A. of France.
Indonesia, also acting partly in response to a perceived lack of technology transfer by the Japanese, recently decided to start its own national car project. It is offering significant tariff and tax advantages to a joint venture between a son of President Suharto and Kia Motors of South Korea. Tokyo and Washington have complained that the move violates international trade laws.
American auto parts suppliers are also moving into Asia. Delco, a division of G.M., plans to make electronic components in Singapore, and the Dana Corporation will build axles in Thailand. But here, too, the Japanese are far ahead, setting up supply networks in which factories in different countries specialize in different parts and export them throughout the region. Mr. Dunne of Automotive Resources Asia said he believed that such supply systems and dealer networks gave them an almost unbeatable edge against American and European interlopers. "I think that for the next five years, the Japanese will be very strong," he said.


GRAPHIC: Honda has created a car for the Asian market similar to the Civic. The new car -- the City -- is one of several designed by world auto makers for cities like Bangkok, above (Agence France-Presse), where streets are often poorly built and congested. Here are some differences:
 
ROAD CLEARANCE
Chart: "Civic vs. City"
 The City's clearance is 6.8 inches, about an inch more than the Civic, because of Asia's bumpier roads.
 
ENGINE COMPUTER
The City's engine control computer is positioned higher than the Civic's to protect it from flooding.
 
ENGINE SIZE
 Poor road quality and congestion mean lower speeds, so the City is built with a smaller engine.
 
SUSPENSION
 The City's strut system is simpler than the Civic's wishbone system, which can handle higher speeds.
 
TURNING RADIUS
 The City has a tighter turning radius to better negotiate the narrow, twisting roads of Asia.

HEADLINE: NBC to Get Subsidy Package To Expand a Cable Network

BYLINE: By LAWRIE MIFFLIN 

 BODY:
NBC and Microsoft announced yesterday that their new 24-hour cable news network, MSNBC, will move down the road from Fort Lee, N.J., to expanded headquarters in Secaucus in November, taking advantage of a hefty package of financial incentives offered by the state.
Under terms of legislation signed by Gov. Christine Todd Whitman last month, as much as 80 percent of the personal income tax revenue generated by each new employee brought on New Jersey's tax rolls by the cable network will be returned to the companies, for up to 10 years. 
 The New Jersey Economic Development Authority will also issue up to $150 million in bonds to provide money for NBC and Microsoft to buy money and equipment, Governor Whitman said at a news conference at the Fort Lee studios of CNBC, NBC's business-news cable channel. MSNBC, which will begin operating on July 15, will share space with CNBC in Fort Lee until the Secaucus building is ready.
NBC and Microsoft will invest $500 million in the new cable news network, and expect it to generate 400 new jobs in New Jersey, according to Bob Wright, the president and chief executive officer of NBC, who also spoke at the news conference.
MSNBC will appear on cable channels reaching 20 million homes, as well as on the Internet. NBC's America's Talking channel is being converted into MSNBC.
Governor Whitman said the cable news network was one of the first companies to benefit from the new employment incentive program.
"This is a way to encourage high-income jobs to locate in New Jersey," she said. "We give the businesses money up front when they most need it, when they're starting a new enterprise."
Gualberto Medina, the State Commerce Commissioner, described the incentive package as "a very large carrot." He said the formula for the percentage of income tax to be returned and the number of years would be determined by a complicated formula based on the number of new employees MSNBC hires and when they are hired.
Mr. Wright said NBC had signed a 15-year lease with Hartz Industries, owner of the 110,000-foot Secaucus property.
"We're moving toward a totally computer-based system that will help us coordinate with our friends in Redmond, Wash.," Andrew Lack, president of NBC News, said, referring to Microsoft headquarters.
Mr. Lack also said much of NBC's assignment operations would be conducted in Secaucus because "as a 24-hour news service, MSNBC will be playing a major role in our news gathering."
James Hughes, dean of the School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University, said New Jersey's incentive plan was like those some other states have developed.
"By giving some or most of the personal income tax back to the company," the dean said, "you're still getting some revenue and you're not reducing existing tax revenue. And you're creating new jobs that might not be there otherwise."

HEADLINE: State Panel to Announce Riverfront Plan

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
Breaking a stubborn bureaucratic logjam, state officials are to release a long-awaited plan today for construction of a five-mile-long park on the West Side of Manhattan, and will recommend to the Governor that the state help pay for it.
The action is an important step toward building the park, which has languished even as construction began in April on a new roadway that was to be built in tandem with the narrow riverfront park between Battery Park and 59th Street. 
 "The outlay of funds is the most important thing," Charles Gargano, chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, said.
For many months, city officials had expressed anger at the state for not making a firm commitment to match the city's contribution of $100 million to build the park, and park advocates were despairing over the slipping away of an opportunity to cut costs by building the park together with the roadway.
Although aides to Gov. George E. Pataki would not say whether the Governor would approve the state contribution, advocates for the park were optimistic that today's announcement would put the plan back on track.
"This means the state has endorsed the concept, which is critically important," said Tom Fox, an opponent of Westway and the former president of the Hudson River Park Conservancy, which manages the park.
"In the last year, you never knew whether the Governor was going to say yes or no," he added.
The park and roadway are the descendants of the Westway project of the 1970's. The original plan, in 1975, called for the road to be an underground superhighway built through landfill dumped in the Hudson; atop the buried road was to be a sweeping green space. But fierce opponents and hard economics have shrunk the road to a six-lane boulevard with traffic lights and the park to an emerald sliver.
When construction of the road began on April 4, park advocates began to fear that the park might be forgotten amid the construction rubble. Ann L. Buttenweiser, chairwoman of the Parks Council, suggested that without the park, there would be nothing to draw people to the banks and piers of the Hudson.
Yesterday, she made it clear that she would not consider the problem solved until park construction actually began. "We now have to push to make sure the park starts to get built along with the first phase of roadway building," she said.
Deputy Mayor Fran Reiter also expressed caution along with approval for the state's action. "I see it as a first step, and if it is, I'm very pleased," she said. "I've been calling for this for a long time."
The park as envisioned by the plan includes a four-and-a-half-mile waterfront esplanade, with 13 former shipping piers converted to ballfields, playgrounds and boating facilities, with gardens, fountains and public gardens included.
The plan was prepared by the landscape architecture firm of Quennell Rothschild Associates after more than 90 meetings with residents of riverfront communities. The goal is for the park's operations to be paid for with rent from commercial development at three locations. Those sites would be the only ones where businesses would be allowed.
"Unfortunately, too many times, projects are built and left to die," Mr. Gargano said. "And we knew we could not ask the taxpayers for funding."
Mr. Gargano said that release of the plan cleared the way for an environmental impact statement to begin, to be followed by the drawing of detailed construction plans. Groundbreaking for the first park segment, in Greenwich Village where the first section of road is being built, is expected in the spring of 1998, with park completion by 2005.
Mr. Gargano said the Governor was committed to refurbishing Manhattan's West Side, particularly its decrepit riverfront where piers are rotting and where parking lots and razor wire have become constants in a dreary and monotonous landscape since shipping died in the late 1960's.
"This is the greatest city in the world, and we have the worst-looking waterfront," he said.
But Mr. Gargano said he expected opposition. "People will oppose anything whether it's good or bad nowadays," he said.
Indeed, some environmentalists, including some of the toughest opponents of Westway, hate the park as proposed, considering it a boondoggle for developers in the form of an unaccountable state authority. The park conservancy is a subsidiary of the Empire State Development Corporation, the principal state economic development agency.
"It's building pyramids in the river," complained Marcy Benstock, who as chairwoman of the Clean Air Campaign has fought development on the Hudson River for nearly a quarter of a century, usually successfully.
Even more ominous to the park is opposition by Greenwich Village residents to plans for Pier 40 at West Houston Street, which is currently used as a 2,000-place car park. These foes demand that the pier be a large green park and nothing else. Park planners insist they need to use about a quarter of the pier to make money from such things as restaurants, to enable the remainder to be a self-sustaining park space.
But residents have vowed war to get the park they want, and say they are willing to use the courts and elections to stall the rest of the park to get what they want on Pier 40. "We're ready to go to the mat," said Ben Green, chairman of Community Board 2.
But other environmentalists are starting to worry that the result may be no park at all. Environmental groups including the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Environmental Defense Fund have been meeting among themselves, and occasionally with state officials, to develop a more pragmatic view, although few are willing to criticize Ms. Benstock's position.
"The more we argue, the more we're going to lose," said Andre Mele, environmental director of the Hudson River Sloop Clearwater Inc. "We're just going to lose the whole thing piece by piece."

Asia in the Village
The hardest thing to like about Cafe Asean is the name. Asean (pronounced AH-see-ehn) stands for Association of South-East Asian Nations, an unaccountably bureaucratic burden for a charming little cafe that combines the vogue for pan-Asian menus with a pleasantly spare, rustic American look and an eager-to-please staff. 
 That earnest quality is characteristic of somebody new to the restaurant business. Simpson Wong, the co-owner and manager of Cafe Asean, has held many jobs in New York, but his restaurant experience is limited to a stint as a waiter in a Japanese restaurant. So he tours the restaurant, not only making suggestions but also asking what you really thought about the food. "Honestly," he said. "We want feedback."
So here it goes. I love the fresh, direct quality of many of the dishes. Bun tom ($7), the Vietnamese standard of rice vermicelli served cold with grilled shrimp, is wonderful as a main course or for sharing as an appetizer, perfectly cooked and fragrant with mint. Goi tom and goi bo ($5), fresh salads of lettuce, basil and mint topped by either grilled shrimp or slices of grilled beef, are simple and satisfying, with the pleasing contrast between the cool greens and the savory topping augmented by a slightly sweet dressing. Goi cuon ($5) -- or summer rolls -- shrimp and rice noodles wrapped in soft rice paper and served cool with a sweet peanut sauce for dipping, are also refreshing.
The menu is mostly Vietnamese, with a scattering of Thai and Malaysian dishes, and if it sounds as if I gravitated toward the Vietnamese, it's because the restaurant was out of its other specialties, like deep-fried whole fish with chili sauce, and curried squid. One entree that I especially liked was chicken sauteed with lemongrass and chilies ($10). The ethnicity of this deliciously spicy dish is muddled with the addition of piquant anise-flavored Thai basil and a Chinese mixture of vegetables that included onions, peppers and broccoli. Vietnamese beef rolls ($11), thin slices of grilled beef rolled around garlic and onions, are remarkably pungent. Pork chop marinated with lemongrass and honey ($9) is pleasant, and though it's tame, it's better than "chicken chop" prepared the same way.
Desserts are hard to come by. On one occasion none were available. On another, the only choice was coconut flan ($3.50), not too sweet and full of coconut flavor.
The inviting little dining room is outfitted with simple distressed wood tables that have been carefully antiqued, and flea-market chairs. Mirrors adorn a brick wall, the other is sponged yellow, and the mullioned bay window in front glows with candles at night.
Cafe Asean is housed in what was once Flavor-Cup, a coffee store that was a Village institution until the last owner died in 1995. Mr. Wong says his hope is to be as much a part of the neighborhood as his predecessor.

 
 
New Faces
 A few years ago, when I first wrote about MERIDIANA, an Italian cafe with an unusual Roman-ruin decor, the food was very good, but the service was not. Now, after a change of ownership, the service has greatly improved, and the food is better than ever. Among the excellent dishes I've tasted there recently were spaghetti with white clam sauce ($11), fennel sausages and roasted peppers in white wine sauce ($11), and a plate of mixed grilled seafood ($17) that included succulent baby octopus and was so big it could have served two.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Surprise British Rate Cut Hurts Pound vs. Dollar and Mark

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The British pound fell against the dollar and the mark yesterday after the Bank of England suprised currency traders by cutting interest rates.
The central bank lowered bank- lending rates by a quarter percentage point to 5.75 percent, the fourth reduction since December, citing moderate economic growth and slowing inflation. 
 "The British rate cut has knocked a little bit of the wind out of sterling's sails," said John McCarthy, manager of foreign exchange at ING Capital Markets.
The pound fell as low as $1.5390 against the dollar before recovering in New York to $1.5425, down from $1.5475 on Wednesday. The pound fell as low as 2.3525 marks before recovering to 2.3604 marks, down from 2.3711 marks on Wednesday.
The dollar held steady against the yen and mark, as traders awaited important economic reports from the United States and Japan today.
The dollar traded at 109.21 yen, compared with 109.02 yen on Wednesday. During the day, the dollar climbed as high as 109.52 yen, the highest level since Feb. 4, 1994, when it was quoted at 109.60 yen. The dollar fell to 1.5296 marks from 1.5308.
Britain was not alone in cutting rates. France and Denmark also surprised investors by reducing interest rates. But trading was thin in Europe yesterday, with markets closed in Germany, Austria and Portugal.
The key event for the yen, traders said, will be today's release of Japan's quarterly survey of business sentiment, known as the tankan. Economists, on average, forecast that the outlook for major manufacturers would rise to minus 6 for the second quarter from minus 12 in the first quarter.
That would suggest that while the economy is improving, it is probably still too weak to prompt the Bank of Japan to raise interest rates, and could benefit the dollar, traders said.
"Japanese officials would play down that kind of increase," said David Tankin, international bond portfolio manager at the Saudi British Bank in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. "They wouldn't want to raise rates because the economy is still kind of weak."
Signs of the direction of the United States economy and of interest rates will come today, when the Labor Department reports on May employment. Economists predicted that the economy added 153,000 nonfarm jobs in May, after a rise of 2,000 in April.

HEADLINE: 30-Year Bond Up Sharply For 3d Session

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities posted strong gains yesterday for the third consecutive session as market participants braced for today's employment report.
Buying was bolstered by comments by two Federal Reserve officials in an article in The Washington Post yesterday. The officials, Janet L. Yellen and Susan M. Phillips, indicated that they thought economic growth remained steady, suggesting to many in the market that the Fed would not soon change monetary policy despite recent remarks from other Fed officials that indicated a growing concern over inflation. 
 As fears of an imminent interest rate increase eased, speculators who had set up bets that prices would fall ahead of the employment report, scrambled to buy to cover their short positions. The market largely held on to the gains made in the morning.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond settled up 22/32 , to 8825/32 . The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 6.89 percent from 6.95 percent.
"Today was more a day of position squaring, with a number of large players buying securities and not necessarily more paper but moving around the yield curve," said Tony Crescenzi, head of government bond trading at Miller, Tabak, Hirsch & Company, a New York brokerage firm.
Mr. Crescenzi noted that the market was better prepared for the previous two monthly employment reports, based on options activity.
Options activity signals how people are positioning themselves. "Call volume in the week preceding the employment report up through yesterday is exceeding put volume by 130 percent above normal," he said. "In the week prior to the week to the last two reports, the call volume was only 75 percent of normal.
"What it suggests is that maybe the market has dropped its guard this time, since the yield on the long bond is up around 7 percent, a level that portfolio managers find attractive. And the way people are positioning themselves shows me that they may have more of a willingness to participate in the market than expected."
David A. Levy, director of forecasting at Jerome Levy Economics Institute, said the economy was on more solid footing now than it was six months ago, but its strength was overrated.
There is real strength in the residential building market, and auto sales and high technology, he said.
Still, he said, "This is not an economy that will overheat, nor experience a huge inventory buildup."
Mr. Levy said he expected that the economy would continue to expand through the year, but at a more sluggish pace.
"I think the inflation fears that ran rampant in the bond market, among other things, will prove to be unfounded," he said. "Concerns about labor inflation flaring are also exaggerated. When you get into a period of tight labor and wages do increase, it doesn't happen in one explosive burst, but rather gradually. So even if we were getting to that point, we'd be talking about a small impact on inflation this year."

HEADLINE: Heresy at Fed: Calls for Cuts In Interest Rates;
Greenspan Critics Say War On Inflation Has Been Won

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 6

 BODY:
Few here were surprised in February when Alan Greenspan won renomination as chairman of the Federal Reserve, given the success of his nine-year war on inflation. But three months later Mr. Greenspan's confirmation remains stalled in the Senate over questions of whether he has carried that war too far.
Even Senator Tom Harkin, the Iowa Democrat who has single-handedly blocked a vote, concedes that Mr. Greenspan will eventually be confirmed for a third term, in a vote that could come as early as next week. If nothing else, though, Mr. Harkin's stubborn opposition to Mr. Greenspan has focused attention on a contrarian movement that contends the time is right for Mr. Greenspan to change his focus. 
 Liberal politicians like Mr. Harkin, joined by a growing number of prominent business executives and a handful of economists, argue that instead of maintaining a single-minded concentration on price stability, Mr. Greenspan and his colleagues at the nation's central bank should recognize that inflation is no longer as great a threat. With prices restrained and the economy growing at rates that are sluggish by historical standards, they say, the Fed should move to reduce interest rates in hopes of stimulating job creation and faster growth.
"I believe very strongly that the Fed should be leaning more forward toward growth, and not be so concerned with the threat of inflation," said Dana G. Mead, the chief executive of Tenneco Inc. and the chairman of the National Association of Manufacturers, an influential lobbying group. "A change in monetary policy is not the only thing we need, but it's a necessary condition to get started."
Mr. Harkin, who is using the generous rights of delay the Senate grants individual members to block the nomination, wants Republicans to agree to a three-day Senate debate on monetary policy as the price for allowing a vote on Mr. Greenspan and two other Fed nominees, Alice M. Rivlin and Laurence H. Meyer. He has not budged yet despite a personal visit from Mr. Greenspan, a phone call from President Clinton and repeated pleas from other Administration officials. (Senate leaders are expected to push for a vote on the nominations in a way that allows a limited debate.)
"The Fed today is not concerned about the threat of inflation, nor even about the shadow of a threat, but about the reflection of the shadow of the threat," Senator Harkin said. "To keep our economy in a harness when there is all this potential for growth does all of us a disservice."
There has always been pressure on the Fed for "easy money," and the case that the inflation risk should be downgraded in favor of more monetary stimulus remains very much a minority view, at least among economists. Moreover, mainstream economists warn that when the Fed tried to "fine tune" the economy in an effort to stimulate growth during the 1970's it helped set off an inflationary spiral that was brought under control only after a long and painful recession in the early 1980's.
"If printing money could create real output and wealth, then all the world's problems would be solved," said Paul L. Kasriel, the chief domestic economist at the Northern Trust Company in Chicago.
Mr. Greenspan and his colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board are equally dismissive of the pro-growth advocates, saying that those who are calling for lower rates misunderstand the economy's problems and the role of monetary policy, and overstate the Fed's ability to influence long-term growth. In any case, they add, there is little evidence that the economy can chug along right now any faster than it already is.
"It's a very confused set of arguments," said Janet L. Yellen, a Fed governor.
Yet the increasingly vocal debate over Fed policy is coming at a time when the broader question of how to get the economy growing faster is becoming a big issue in this year's Presidential campaign.
"Slow economic growth is America's No. 1 economic problem," said a draft report prepared for Senator Bob Dole's Republican Presidential campaign several weeks ago by his economic advisers. "America desperately needs new pro-growth policies to raise wages and secure the incomes of workers, now and in the new century."
Some of Mr. Dole's advisers strongly support Mr. Greenspan's anti-inflation focus, arguing that what is needed to spur growth instead are deep tax cuts. President Clinton has been more ambivalent about the Fed's role, calling early this year for further study on whether the economy is capable of higher rates of noninflationary growth. But Mr. Clinton stopped short of advocating a looser Fed policy, and he later renominated Mr. Greenspan.
Despite some ups and downs, the economy in recent years has been growing on average between 2 and 2.5 percent, compared with 4 percent during the 1960's and better than 3 percent in the 1970's.
Most economists believe that the nation's underlying problem is a low rate of increase in productivity, or output by each worker, which the Fed can do practically nothing about. Unless that is overcome, these economists say, the economy will not be able to grow over the long run any faster than about 2.5 percent a year without sparking a rise in inflation.
There is no argument about the benefits of higher noninflationary growth. Adding even half of a percentage point of growth a year, economists said, would allow the economy to create jobs at a faster pace. Wages and living standards would rise. Additional tax revenues would make it easier to balance the Federal budget and to finance troubled programs like Social Security and Medicare.
Those who think the answer begins with an easing of monetary policy are drawn largely from the ranks of liberal politicians and economists, including Senator Harkin, Senator Byron L. Dorgan of South Dakota and a number of other Democratic lawmakers; Felix G. Rohatyn, the New York investment banker, and James K. Galbraith, an economist at the University of Texas.
But these critics of the Fed have now been joined by a less ideologically driven group: business executives like Mr. Mead of Tenneco and John F. Welch Jr., the chairman of General Electric. They argue that the Fed does not understand how the economy has changed in the last 10 years.
"There is no inflation," Mr. Welch said, adding that G.E.'s experience indicates that the economy remains weaker than recent statistics would suggest. "There is no pricing power at all."
The Fed's critics argue that global competition has permanently reduced the ability of producers and retailers to raise prices, and that fear of layoffs has broken the expectation of workers that they can count on hefty annual raises. With prices and wages under such downward pressure, they said, inflation has a much smaller chance of taking root than it did even a few years ago.
"We have a tremendous amount of competitive pressure in the outside world which diminishes the inflationary risks," Mr. Galbraith said.
At the same time, sweeping changes in the business world have made the economy more flexible than ever before, allowing it to respond more quickly to changes in demand and to run with greater efficiency, advocates of lower interest rates say.
"The notion that we must choose between growth and inflation is a false choice," Mr. Rohatyn wrote in Time magazine last month. "Global competition as well as new technologies has set new parameters on every aspect of the economy. A 3 to 3.5 percent growth rate is not only an achievable national objective; it is an economic and social necessity."
Those pressing for lower rates have also attacked the Fed for apparently concluding that policies which would pull unemployment under its current level of 5.4 percent will inevitably lead to inflation.
The unemployment argument revolves around a concept that economists call Nairu, or the nonaccelerating inflation rate of unemployment. It holds that there is an unemployment rate below which labor shortages will create upward pressure on wages, kicking off an inflationary cycle.
Until a year or two ago, the general consensus was that the Nairu was around 6 percent. But unemployment has been below 6 percent for more than a year and a half -- and there are no consistent signs of rising wages or of inflation in general.
"Nairu is to economics what the Nehru jacket is to fashion," Mr. Mead said. "Outdated."
Fed officials and other defenders of its inflation-fighting policies said that advocates of rate-cutting fail to understand how the Fed -- and the economy -- operate.
The Fed, they said, does not really set a ceiling on growth. Similarly, they said, the Fed does not simply look at the unemployment rate and dictate that it can go no lower. Indeed, some officials said a number of Fed policy makers, including Mr. Greenspan, had expressed reservations about relying on Nairu as a predictor of inflation.
Instead, the officials said, the Fed looks deeper into the economy for signs of strain that could lead to inflation. Before a round of rate increases that began early in 1994, for example, Fed officials noted little evidence of actual inflation but saw a number of indicators suggesting that inflation could appear down the road unless they tapped on the brakes.
Among the indicators were delays in lead times for raw materials, delays in deliveries of parts, increases in the number of overtime hours worked and capacity shortages in trucking. Officials said that based on evidence from those indicators, they began raising rates without even having a clear sense of how fast the economy was then growing.
The arguments in favor of reducing rates assume that the Fed "is setting a speed limit on the economy that is wrong and then sitting around not doing anything about it, costing us jobs and improved living standards," Ms. Yellen of the Fed said. "It doesn't work that way. As long as the Federal Reserve keeps its eye on the inflation ball, the economy will grow as fast as it can."

Graphs: "The Limits of Growth"
Many economists say that inflation will swell if growth is allowed to exceed a 2.5 percent annual rate. And under Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve often has seemed to adjust interest rates with that formula in mind.
 
Some critics say the Fed's policies ingnore changes in the economy that make inflation less of a threat. They note, for example, that prices have been stready even as the unemployment rate has fallen below 6 percent, a level thought to signal inflationary pressures on the economy. Graphs show Federal funds target rate, annualized change in the U.S. gross domestic product, U.S. jobless rate and the change in consumer prices from 1987 to 1996.

History Channel Cancels Plan For Series on U.S. Companies

BYLINE: By LAWRIE MIFFLIN 

 BODY:
Abashed by criticism of their plan to produce a series of television profiles of American corporations with those companies, executives of the History Channel decided yesterday to scuttle the project.
The History Channel, one of the fastest-growing new cable channels, had envisioned that the series, "The Spirit of Enterprise," would take an inside look at major American companies by using corporate archives and cooperation. The companies would have underwritten production costs and bought advertising time, and each company would have been given editorial control over the content of its profile. 
 News of the project first appeared in Advertising Age magazine last week, prompting a flurry of other news coverage.
In a prepared statement yesterday, Daniel E. Davids, senior vice president and general manager of the History Channel, said that because of "recent concerns expressed which suggested the appearance of a lack of objectivity surrounding this work in progress, we felt it was in the best interest to abandon the idea."
A spokesman for the channel said Mr. Davids would have no further comment. Another executive, who asked not to be named, said that the channel had intended to label each program so that viewers would be aware of the corporate role in the production but that "any whiff of a perception about our integrity" being compromised was not tolerable.
A somewhat similar project at CNBC, the business-news cable network owned by NBC, a unit of the General Electric Company, will proceed as planned, a spokesman for CNBC said yesterday. It is called "Scan" and will report on new technology and how it affects people's lives, and it will be sponsored exclusively by the International Business Machines Corporation, which will also be a co-owner of the rights to it. Starting in September, "Scan" will be seen on NBC's cable networks in Asia, Europe and Latin America, as well as on CNBC in the United States.
While CNBC executives say they have final editorial control, I.B.M., as sole sponsor, could veto a program by withdrawing. And program topics will be discussed in advance by an advisory board consisting of representatives of CNBC; I.B.M.; the producer, an independent company called Globe TV, and the advertising agency for I.B.M., Ogilvy & Mather. As a result, no program is likely to be produced if there are serious objections from I.B.M. or the others.
The History Channel, an 18-month-old service offering documentaries, movies and mini-series about history, has about 18 million subscribers. It is part of A& E Networks, which is jointly owned by ABC, a unit of the Walt Disney Company, and by the Hearst Corporation and NBC.

HEADLINE: Deal Comes as Atlantic City Is on a Roll

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
With its deal to acquire Bally Entertainment, Hilton Hotels is buying a place at the table in Atlantic City, the East Coast's largest gambling center, just as the Boardwalk rolls toward a major expansion of its ambitions.
The city's plans are buoyed by growing revenue and the sense that casino gambling will not be legalized in nearby states. 
 But, analysts say, Hilton's move also puts it in a market that shows signs of becoming intensely more competitive. Las Vegas giants like Mirage Resorts and Circus Circus Enterprises are planning new properties there that could raise the risk and the stakes for Atlantic City's 13 existing casinos.
Boardwalk casino operators are already planning or building nearly 4,000 new hotel rooms -- a 40 percent increase over the 10,000 they now have, at costs of more than $700 million. Plans announced by Mirage, Boyd Gaming and Circus Circus in recent months would add 6,000 to 8,000 more rooms as part of a $2 billion investment in the Atlantic City economy. MGM Grand Inc. also has a license application pending before the New Jersey Casino Control Commission and is shopping for a site on which to build.
"A lot of the reason casinos are expanding is to meet the pending competition," Bradford S. Smith, the chairman of the commission, said. "There's just a lot of activity and a lot of interest."
Until fairly recently, Atlantic City had been perceived as a tired corner of the gaming world, hurt by competition from successful casinos owned by Native American tribes -- especially Foxwoods in Ledyard, Conn. -- and by the prospect of expanded legalized gambling in Pennsylvania and New York, two key states from which it draws its customers.
Analysts said, though, that the political winds that had seemed to be pointing toward a proliferation of casinos on the East Coast appeared to have shifted and that an improving economy in the Northeast has created more gaming customers who have more money to spend.
"It's put the focus back on Atlantic City and Las Vegas -- they will be the Super Bowls, east and west," said Marvin B. Roffman, a casino industry consultant and the president of Roffman Miller Associates, a Philadelphia money-management firm.
But Hilton, by taking possession of Bally's Atlantic City properties -- the Park Place and the Grand -- will enter the market competing for more than just the next busload of slot players.
Mirage, Circus Circus and Boyd, all of which would build their casinos in a marshy area known as the marina district, have said their plans depend on the state building a $300 million road spur -- including a tunnel -- to the area. The city also gave Mirage the land, on which all three projects would be constructed.
Analysts and casino officials said that such concessions could make it difficult for the existing casinos at the other end of the Boardwalk to compete against the newcomers who would be entering with lower operating costs.
Lower costs could allow the new casinos to offer better odds or better payouts on some games, and that could siphon gamblers away from the older casinos.
The president of the Casino Association of New Jersey, Nicholas R. Amato, said Hilton's purchase showed that the market in Atlantic City was so strong that financial inducements were not needed.
"Hilton is coming in without concessions," he said. "They're coming whether you give them a tunnel or not."

Don't look for tonight's Oscar De La Hoya-Julio Cesar Chavez fight on pay-per-view television. A bout like this, so natural for pay-per-view, where five friends can split a $40 tab, will be carried the closed-circuit way, in arenas, theaters, bars and race tracks, where those five friends will pay $40 each.
The return to closed circuit is the economic brainchild of Bob Arum, De La Hoya's promoter. Arum hopes to change the fight fan's pattern of buying pay-per-view because, he said, cable companies have not clamped down on widespread use of "black boxes" to steal pay-per-view signals and have refused to pay him upfront guarantees for his promotions. And with cable companies not taking 50 percent of the pay-per-view gross, and distributors taking zip, Arum makes more money faster. 
 To hear Arum tell it, he is a warrior entrepreneur, fighting evil cable companies like Time Warner and Tele-Communications Inc. and returning boxing to the dandy days of closed circuit. (By the way, Arum is a partner in TVKO, the pay-per-view arm of HBO Sports.) But eschewing pay-per-view means losing high-powered media and cable system promotion usually poured into a matchup like this. So far, Arum's closed-circuit promotion has not overwhelmed anyone.
In brief, here is Arum's tale: De La Hoya and Chavez are guaranteed $18 million. Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, Nev., has put up a $7 million site fee. Determined to freeze out pay-per-view, Arum took the closed-circuit route, which has been untraveled for a major bout since Sugar Ray Leonard met Marvin Hagler in 1987. But with $11 million left to go, he needed more money.
"What was I supposed to do, put up my portfolios?" Arum said.
So he raised $9.5 million from the entities that cobbled together major market closed-circuit venues, and made a separate deal with Madison Square Garden. With this ad hoc network in place, he approached cable companies looking to make pay-per-view deals where closed circuit was weak. Most balked. Cablevision did not and will show the fight on Long Island and in Cleveland for $39.95.
"Talk about monopolists!" Arum thundered over the phone earlier this week from Las Vegas. "Talk about hardball. These cable companies said if they couldn't carry the fight nationwide, they wouldn't carry it at all. What about their shareholders? They're passing up money. Talk about antitrust violation."
When Arum approached Time Warner Cable of New York City, Richard Aurelio, the president, told the promoter "to go to hell." Why the rancor? As Aurelio described it, Arum wanted to sell Time Warner pay-per-view rights in some pockets of its systems, but not others. "It would be a nightmare to market it to some areas he's cherry-picked and black out the others," Aurelio said.
Aurelio added: "He'd call me and say he'd made a deal with Time Warner systems in upstate New York. I said, 'Oh, yeah, really?' And he said: 'No, no, I didn't actually sign a deal. But I can give you Manhattan.' I said, 'You've already got the Garden, and the Garden says it would violate their contract if I put it on in Manhattan.' It's impossible doing business with him."
Hugh Panero, president of Request Television, a major pay-per-view distributor, said: "He's doing this to squeeze more out of cable operators. And while he's found he can resurrect the closed-circuit network for this fight, it'll be enormously difficult to resurrect it again."
One resurrected closed-circuit player is Lou Falcigno, president of Momentum Enterprises, who left the game in 1988 when pay-per-view subsumed the business. Venues in his 200-site market include the 2,500-seat Beacon Theater. "It's heating up," he said. "I made six new deals this morning."
Arum expects a gross between $60 million and $80 million. He has three million seats in closed-circuit sites under contract in the United States and still more in Mexico. He says nearly 800,000 tickets already have been sold for an average $35 each. Various venues have sold out, especially in areas with strong Hispanic bases. Madison Square Garden has sold 3,871 of 15,000 seats, for $40 to $100 each.
Arum admits that taking the closed-circuit path is not consumer-friendly, but he knows that tonight's matchup pairs a pay-per-view perennial in Chavez and a boxer gaining renown in De La Hoya. Hard-core fans will pay.
"There's been an outcry," he said. "In many places, people chant, 'Pay-per-view!' But what am I supposed to do? This isn't about greed."
Well, then it's about taking advantage of consumers, who must dig deeper for a marquee bout in a boisterous facility where the announcers are not likely to be heard. Poor fans might be better off reading about the fight, then waiting for HBO's expected replay next week.
It also seems to be about revenge on the cable companies Arum will surely deal with in the future. When he rails about the Time Warner senior vice president who gave a final "no" on a cherry-picking pay-per-view deal, he said, "The most gratifying part of all is the Fred Dresslers of the world will get nothing!"

HEADLINE: Council Panel Backs Higher Minimum Wages

BYLINE: By VIVIAN S. TOY 

 BODY:
A City Council committee unanimously approved a bill yesterday that would require some city contractors to pay higher minimum wages to their employees, affecting about 3,500 workers and increasing the city's contracting costs by about $15 million a year.
The bill, which the full Council is expected to approve later this month, would require contractors in four areas -- security, cleaning, food services and temporary office work -- to pay workers what is known as the "prevailing wage," or the standard wage that private-sector workers receive in each of those industries. 
 The measure, approved 8 to 0 yesterday by the Council's Committee on Contracts, is far less sweeping than the original proposal, which would have required a minimum wage of $12.10 an hour as well as health benefits for all private-sector workers employed under city contracts. But Council officials said narrowing the focus and the range of the bill was the only way to insure passage.
It was unclear yesterday whether Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani would veto the compromise bill. He has opposed earlier versions of the bill, saying he believed they would cost the city too much. But with 39 co-sponsors, including the Council's Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, the bill has more than the 34 votes needed to override a mayoral veto.
Deputy Mayor Rudy Washington said that while no decision had been made on whether to veto, the administration continued to oppose setting wage standards, arguing that the regulations would drive businesses out of the city and ultimately would hurt the city's economy. In an exchange with Council members that grew increasingly testy, the Deputy Mayor responded to members who said they hoped to expand the prevailing-wage bill eventually to other industries by saying, "We might as well dust off the Communist Manifesto."
But Council members argued that the city should not pay wages lower than the going rate in the private sector. They said the proposed law would help lift people who work under city contracts above the poverty line by providing enough money so they do not need welfare, food stamps or housing subsidies.
Councilman Sal F. Albanese, the Democrat from Brooklyn who proposed the original bill, called the vote "a moral victory for workers" that would help put "money in the pockets of middle- and working-class families."
Under the proposed law, the prevailing wage for the four industries would be determined by the City Comptroller. Council officials said the new wage levels would range from a minimum of $7.25 an hour for unarmed security guards up to $12 an hour for janitors. Food workers would earn about $9 an hour and temporary office workers would make at least $11.25 an hour.
The city now spends about $200 million a year in those industries, which is just a fraction of the $3 billion the city spends on contracts annually. (The $3 billion does not include construction contracts, for which the city is required by state law to pay union scale wages.)
The Council proposal was championed by a coalition of nearly 100 labor unions seeking to increase wages for workers who have been paid as little as the minimum wage -- $4.25 an hour -- and who have received no benefits from city contractors.
John J. Sweeney, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., praised the bill, but he urged the Council to expand it to all other city contracts. "While the Living Wage Bill represents a step in the right direction," Mr. Sweeney said, "this leaves thousands of additional workers at peril of being forced to work at city-funded positions at substandard wages."

HEADLINE: Claims for Jobless Benefits Increased 9,000

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 6

 BODY:
New claims for jobless benefits unexpectedly shot up by 9,000 last week, but analysts said they remained at a level consistent with modest employment growth.
"We're not talking boom-time numbers," said Robert G. Dederick, economic consultant for the Northern Trust Company in Chicago. "Rather, they're in line with steady, moderate growth." 
 First-time applications for unemployment insurance totaled a seasonally adjusted 354,000, up from 345,000 a week earlier, the Labor Department reported today.
It was the first gain in three weeks and larger than many analysts had expected since the week included the Memorial Day holiday, and thus fewer days to file claims.
The unexpected increase in new claims for jobless benefits brought to an end a series of eight straight weekly declines in the four-week moving average. The average notched up 3,500, to 349,000, after falling from 394,250 in March.
Many analysts consider the less-volatile four-week average to be a more accurate measure of labor conditions because it smooths out the spikes in the weekly reports.

HEADLINE: $1.5 Billion Bond Act Sought By Pataki for Environment

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki proposed a $1.5 billion bond act yesterday to attack environmental problems that he said have dogged New York State for decades.
"Only an immediate and massive infusion of capital" can solve these problems, Mr. Pataki said on the Hudson River waterfront in Battery Park City, his Manhattan stop on an all-day hopscotch helicopter tour to promote the plan across the state. 
 Administration officials said the bond issue would cost each New Yorker less than $5 a year over the next 40 years, and they insisted that the cost would be far outweighed by the payoff, both in immediate construction jobs and long-term environmental and economic benefits.
Some critics, however, said the proposal looked less like a far-reaching plan than a cobbled-together list of environmental issues that have presented political problems for Mr. Pataki and Republicans from New York City to the Adirondacks. Others said the plan, which includes money for building and improving sewage treatment plants across the state, could also be read as a recipe for doling out substantial political pork.
Still, representatives of environmental groups praised the proposal for its unusual commitment of money to finance projects aimed at cleaning drinking water and waterways, reducing air pollution and closing bulging landfills, including the Fresh Kills dump on Staten Island. Mr. Pataki also proposed a state research center for designing electric vehicles and money to begin converting New York City buses from sooty diesel to less-polluting natural gas.
Some environmental lobbyists were as impressed with the plan's political design as they were with its environmental content. John Sheehan, a spokesman for the Adirondack Council, a private group that has been a frequent critic of Mr. Pataki, said that $50 million for fixing rural landfills, with particular emphasis on the Adirondacks, would likely win the Governor the critical support of upstate Republican senators.
"It contains money for nearly every problematic Republican Senate district," Mr. Sheehan said.
Altogether, the potential benefits of the bond plan would stretch from Long Island to Buffalo, as Mr. Pataki pointed out on his all-day promotional tour, which was carried out a day after budget negotiations in Albany collapsed. The failure of those talks made it likely that Mr. Pataki would preside over the tardiest budget agreement on record, and he has been using events like this one to distance himself from the fray.
The bond proposal, which requires the Legislature's approval by Aug. 5 if it is to appear on the ballot in November, was carefully drafted to avoid the fate of a $1.98 billion environmental bond act proposed by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo in 1990. That act, which focused mainly on land purchases, was sharply attacked by upstate politicians -- particularly in the Adirondacks -- who feared it would result in condemnation of thousands of acres of private land.
Mr. Cuomo's plan was also attacked by some environmental groups, which contended that its weaknesses were a result of his failure to consult them. That bond act lost by 20,000 votes, in stark contrast to the record for past bonds for environmental programs or land purchases -- with the six previous efforts from 1960 to 1986 -- passing handily.
Mr. Pataki suffered in that defeat; as an Assemblyman, he was a sponsor of the legislation that put the Cuomo bond act on the ballot. He had supported the Cuomo plan because his Hudson Valley district would have benefitted from the money. To avoid a similar mistake, Mr. Pataki held a monthlong series of meetings with environmental groups.
He asked, "What do I have to do that wasn't done in 1990?" John Cronin, an environmental patrolman for the Hudson Riverkeeper Fund, said. "I said, 'You've got to be willing to go down in flames to support this.' And he swore he'll be twice as committed on Election Day as he is now."
Mr. Pataki may not have to press too hard, given the proposal's broad sprinkling of cleanups, jobs and money for towns across the state.
The biggest single element would be a $300 million revolving loan fund for municipalities to use to improve drinking water supplies. The plan would also provide $100 million in direct grants for poor communities seeking to improve their water supply systems.
For New York City, the plan would provide money to eliminate sources of pollution that have contaminated New York Harbor and also put up $75 million toward the cost of closing and sealing the Fresh Kills landfill.
Cities around the state would also share $200 million to clean up industrial sites that are not dirty enough to qualify as toxic waste sites, but lie fallow because they are too tainted to find any willing buyers.
Mr. Pataki also proposed $200 million to improve sewage treatment plants whose wastewater enters Long Island Sound, so that nitrogen wastes that rob the waters of oxygen are eliminated. Syracuse's Onondaga Lake, long fouled by pollution, would get $75 million for environmental projects.
Business groups and environmental groups both cheered the inclusion of $100 million aimed at developing a research center in New York, buying natural-gas buses to begin replacing New York City's aging diesel vehicles and building or refurbishing several city bus depots to supply gas to the new fleets.
Mr. Pataki said the bond issue would not shake his commitment to fully finance the state's Environmental Protection Fund, a pot of money for environmental projects created in 1993 and financed with revenue from a real-estate transfer tax. That tax has this year produced a $90 million surplus, which administration officials said would be used to make the first interest payments on the bond issue.
The bond act will likely go through changes in the Senate and the Assembly, administration officials said. Yesterday, it appeared that Mr. Pataki would have a broad range of allies as he pushed the Legislature for support. The plan, which would generate hundreds of construction-related jobs, is likely to gain the support of unions. Ever since the 1965 Pure Waters Bond Act of Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller, the unions have supported most bond acts.
At the Manhattan news conference in Battery Park City, the Governor was flanked by environmental groups and representatives of the business community.
A conspicuous participant was Daniel B. Walsh, president of the New York State Business Council, which had fought the Cuomo environmental bond issue.
Mr. Walsh highlighted the plan's environmental benefits, but was quick to gush about the prospects for new jobs.
"This program will help local governments meet their obligations to reduce pollution and protect clean water supplies," he said. "In the process it'll produce construction jobs in the short run and enhance the state's economic attractiveness in the long run."

HEADLINE: Profit Taking Puts an End To a Rally

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Stocks ended lower as an early rally fizzled after ferocious profit-taking in the technology sector bloodied some investors and pressured the overall market.
Speculators in some technology issues "are getting their heads handed to them and that's put a damper on the entire market," said Michael Metz, chief investment strategist for Oppenheimer & Company. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 30.29 points, or five-tenths of 1 percent, to 5,667.19. I.B.M. and Aluminum Company of America accounted for a little more than half of the Dow's drop.
"Technology stocks, from blue chips to story stocks, were taken down on nervousness about earnings momentum," said Marty Kearney, a trader at PTI Securities.
The Standard & Poor's composite of 500 stocks fell 5.41 points, to 673.03.
The Nasdaq composite index, laded with technology issues, tumbled 16.63 points, to 1,232.52. The index set a record high on Wednesday.
Mr. Metz said cooling speculative fervor would aid market sentiment later. "They're bloodied now and don't have the guts to take a licking and buy something," he said. " Serious investors are waiting to get the jobs report out of the way."
The Labor Department reports today on employment in May. Previous monthly employment reports have roiled the stock and bond markets.
Stocks were also bolstered by a drop in interest rates as bond prices, which move in the opposite direction from their yields, rose. Bonds were helped by growing confidence that the Federal Reserve would keep monetary policy on hold in July.
The decline in the Dow was led by I.B.M., which tumbled 3 3/8, to 101 1/2. Traders and industry analysts said Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette made negative comments on the stock, saying its revenues were under pressure in the current quarter. Donaldson Lufkin officials declined to comment.
Digital Equipment shed 3 1/4, to 46 3/8. Goldman, Sachs cut fiscal 1996 and 1997 earnings estimates, citing weakness in personal computer sales. SoundView trimmed its 1996 estimates.
Other computer makers fell in sympathy, with Hewlett-Packard off 1 3/4, to 104 1/4 and Sun Micro down 2 3/4, to 63 7/8.
Stocks recommended by the Cabot Market Letter tumbled sharply yesterday, a day after the investment newsletter said it was involved in a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation of a stock it promoted.
On Wednesday,the newsletter's co-editor, Timothy Lutts, said the commission had asked his newsletter to hand over materials related to comments it had made on Presstek Inc.
Presstek fell 31 1/2 yesterday, to 77 1/2.
Iomega fell 1 7/8, to 37 7/8, America Online lost 1 1/4, to 46 3/8 and Checkpoint Systems was off 2 1/8, to 35. The stocks have benefited from Cabot recommendations in recent months.
Mr. Lutts, commenting on the drops in stocks that his newsletter recommended, called the factors "psychological and technical."
"None of it relates to the company's business," he said of Presstek's fall in particular.
Another focus of attention was Bally Entertainment, up 2 7/8, to 28 3/8, and Hilton Hotels, off 3/4, to 113 3/4, after they announced that Hilton would buy Bally in a stock deal valued at $2 billion. A deal had been rumored in recent weeks.
Declining issues led advances by a margin of 1,391 to 1,021 in the broader market on heavy volume of 464.8 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange. The session was the busiest since May 8, when 493 million shares changed hands.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE DEMOCRAT;
Clinton Has a New Gift for the Middle Class

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 6

 BODY:
In another appeal to the middle-class, President Clinton moved today to lower closing costs by $200 for first-time homebuyers who use Government-backed loans financed by the Federal Housing Administration.
By itself, the move was modest; it will cost the Government only about $20 million a year, made up through savings in other F.H.A. operations. But it was the final step in lowering the average closing cost to $3,400, from $4,400 in 1994, and Mr. Clinton can do it without Congressional approval. Perhaps 100,000 first-time buyers might qualify for it, officials said, and it is the kind of popular issue the White House loves to embrace. 
 On Tuesday, Mr. Clinton proposed a new $1,500-per-child tax credit to help finance the first two years of college for families earning up to $100,000 a year. By contrast, that would require legislation and would cost about $8 billion over the next six years, but today's announcement was part of a similar theme.
"It's been American dream week: college educations and home ownership," said Michael D. McCurry, the White House press secretary.
Republicans were quick to seize on the announcement as politically inspired, and Senator Bob Dole's spokesman, Nelson Warfield, dismissed it as "chump change" compared with how Mr. Clinton "has raised costs on all homebuyers this year by refusing to sign a balanced budget."
Since talks on a balanced budget stalled in January, Mr. Warfield said, mortgage rates have risen so that the average homeowner now faces an extra $918 a year in interest.
But Mr. Clinton said the Republicans had "walked away" from negotiations and that the two sides should "pass the savings we have in common" to balance the budget now.
"If we did that," he said, "we'd get interest rates down some more," and more Americans would be able to buy homes.
Mr. Clinton used the occasion of a national conference on home ownership organized by the Department of Housing and Urban Development to announce the proposal and to brag about a 15-year high in homeownership, just over 65 percent of households last year, and to pledge a goal of 67.5 percent of households by 2000, or 8 million new homeowners.
"I want to have eight million Americans able to say two of the most beautiful words in the English language, 'Welcome home,' by the year 2000," Mr. Clinton said.
Representative Rick Lazio, a Republican from West Islip, L.I., countered, "Hard work and a good economy help Americans buy their own homes, not White House speeches. This is just another example of election-year posturing aimed to mislead voters."
The President's directive calls on the Federal Housing Administration -- a Depression-era lending insurance agency -- to reduce its up-front mortgage insurance premiums by 11 percent, which would save an average homebuyer $200 in closing costs.
That would be the second such reduction since Mr. Clinton took office; the first cut, of 25 percent, saved an average of $600 in closing costs, while agency streamlining produced another $200 for homeowners, for an overall total of $1,000 in savings. The typical mortgage through the F.H.A. is for $80,000.
Housing Secretary Henry G. Cisneros said the reduction should be effective by the beginning of the new fiscal year, on Oct. 1.
Mr. Clinton was joined for the announcement by Spencer and Lisa Kasten, a wholesome-looking couple of 25 and 24 years old from Holland, Mich., who recently bought their first home for $57,000 with the help of an F.H.A. mortgage. They rode with Mr. Clinton in the Presidential limousine from the White House to the Omni Shoreham Hotel for the conference, where Ms. Kasten introduced him.
Mr. Clinton recalled that the first home he bought 20 years ago, when he and Hillary Rodham were teaching law in Fayetteville, Ark., before their marriage, had cost $20,500 for 1,100 square feet, and carried a monthly mortgage payment of $174. As he has many times, he recounted how he bought the home to persuade Mrs. Clinton to marry him.
Asked by reporters if it wasn't about time for him to buy a new one, the President laughed and replied: "I hope not. I hope I've got a little time on that."

HEADLINE: Bronx Factory, Lacking Farberware Label, May Close

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
The 700 workers at the Farberware cookware factory in the South Bronx had been hoping that the plant's new owner would do right by them, but this week they got the news they did not want to hear.
They learned that the squat red-brick plant on Bruckner Boulevard was likely to be next on the long list of New York City factories to close. 
 At a news conference yesterday, factory workers, state officials and union leaders said they felt betrayed by the factory's new owner, the Syratech Corporation, which had indicated that it might market the cookware after selling the Farberware name and plant to an employee-owned company.
Workers expressed shock when Syratech informed them that it had licensed the Farberware name to another manufacturer. The company's name was not disclosed, but union officials say they think it is foreign. Syratech told the workers that it would still lease them the factory's equipment to continue making cookware. But shorn of the famous Farberware name, the pots and pans might also lose their market, workers said.
"I'm pessimistic about the plant's chances," Wilson Flores Jr., a foreman on the nonstick cookware line, said. "It would be different if we still had the Farberware name."
With the sale of the name, workers say, they feel as if Leonard Florence, Syratech's chief executive, had snatched the heart out of their factory.
"What he is doing is un-American," Mr. Flores said, adding that he had no idea how he would support his wife and two children if the plant closed. "He's trying to make a few million dollars more by stepping on the backs of 700 people."
Closing the plant, which has a $300 million annual payroll, would be a major blow to the Bronx, because the factory has 5 percent of the 14,000 manufacturing jobs in the borough.
When Syratech threatened to close the plant after acquiring it two months ago, city, state, borough and union officials tried to persuade the Boston-based company to work out a plan under which Farberware could continue being made there. In an interview yesterday, Mr. Florence said that the officials had not come up with a package that made economic sense to him.
"The consumer in America will only buy a product that's a quality product for a price," he said. "The problem is, they have not been competitive, nor have they been making money. If they're not going to make it at a competitive price, then the American market is not going to buy it."
Mr. Florence said the city had offered to reduce electricity fees and cut trash removal costs to $500,000 from about $750,000.
"That still means $10,000 a week for trash removal," he said, "and that's not acceptable." Syratech, which had revenues of $170 million last year, sells tableware and giftware under the names Towle, International Silver and Wallace Silversmiths.
The workers said they were convinced that through tax breaks, productivity increases and cuts in electricity, water and other costs, Syratech could have made a profit by keeping production in the Bronx -- although perhaps not as large a profit as it would make by obtaining cookware from overseas.
"We're dealing with a very, very cold, calculating individual," said Ben Camadeco, president of the teamsters' local representing plant workers. "He is in my opinion a liquidator."
Teamster officials said that if they could not somehow persuade Syratech to allow the plant to continue producing cookware under the Farberware name, they might begin a nationwide boycott of Farberware products.
"They won't sell any Farberware in the U.S. if they try to take this offshore," said Chris Silvera, a teamster official.
At the news conference yesterday, teamster leaders joined state and borough officials in pledging to fight to keep the plant open somehow. They said they would examine whether it could make cookware for another well-known company or perhaps start a brand.
"The loss of the Farberware name certainly hurts," said Frank Mahoney, executive vice president of the Empire State Development Corporation, the state agency that had worked on the incentives to keep the plant open. "The probability of success at this point is significantly lower than before. Still, we will do everything we can."
Mr. Florence sounded far more upbeat about the plant's prospects than the workers did. "Maybe a Martha Stewart or Julia Child would put their name on cookware made there," he said.
But the workers and their financial advisers said that new lines normally catch on slowly, and that such a new line would certainly not provide enough work for 700 people.
Mr. Florence said he felt bad about the prospect of hundreds of workers' losing their jobs. But he added, "I'm not looking to subsidize them. I have a fiduciary obligation to my stockholders."

HEADLINE: Hospital Says Cash Problem Delays Payroll

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
Interfaith Medical Center, a financially troubled hospital in central Brooklyn, failed to pay its employees yesterday, their scheduled payday.
The hospital said a delay in its Medicaid check from the state had temporarily left it short of cash. The paychecks are scheduled to be issued today. 
 Many hospitals in New York City have been on the brink of such failures, experts said.
Interfaith's inability to pay its employees on time illustrates the precarious nature of hospitals in New York, particularly those that serve the poor. Health economists say that missing a paycheck reflects a dire cash shortage and is often a steppingstone to bankruptcy.
"This is the first time I've gotten notification that salaries just wouldn't be paid," said Dennis Rivera, president of Local 1199 of the National Health and Human Services Employees Union.
A spokeswoman for the hospital, Melissa Krantz, emphasized that a delay in Medicaid checks had led to the problem. The state issued the checks 24 hours late this week because of an impasse between Gov. George E. Pataki and the Legislature over a temporary spending bill. "This is a one-day delay in payroll," Ms. Krantz said in an interview.
The president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, Kenneth E. Raske, said other member hospitals had called to say they were at risk of missing their payrolls. "A number of our hospitals are so cash poor," Mr. Raske said, "that they have someone physically wait for the Medicaid check at the Department of Social Services office each week -- literally wait there -- and then run to the bank to deposit it."
Hospitals usually pick up Medicaid checks on Wednesday afternoons. Many hospitals are struggling because of deep Medicaid cuts and the inroads made by health maintenance organizations, which demand discounts for care. Interfaith could be a poster child for the problem. Despite initiatives to make it more competitive like improved computers and expanded primary care a cash shortage plagues the hospital.
More than 60 percent of its patients are covered by Medicaid, and with buildings dating from the 1920's, the hospital is not physically suited to attract H.M.O. contracts. The hospital has had renovation plans, but the state has not approved financing.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE CAPITOL;
Congress Is Moving On Political Issues, Not on Legislation

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 6

 BODY:
For the second time in 15 months, the Senate failed today to approve a proposed constitutional amendment that would require the Government to maintain a balanced budget. No one expected otherwise.
The 64-to-35 vote, 2 short of the 66 votes needed for passage, ratified what everyone already knew: that the amendment's backers had lost ground when a supporter, Senator Bob Packwood of Oregon, resigned last year and was replaced by an opponent of the measure. 
 But this has not been a week of surprises in Congress. To a degree that even some longtime students of the institution find remarkable, the House and Senate have shelved their customary agenda to seize on another plate of issues: the ones that Senator Bob Dole is likely to wield against President Clinton in this fall's race for the White House.
And so viewers of C-Span have been treated to a Senate debate on anti-ballistic-missile defenses, although it has long been clear that Republicans in the chamber lack the numbers to force a vote on the issue.
They saw the House order Mr. Clinton today to let Wisconsin try out a radical new welfare-to-work program, even though he effectively said two weeks ago that he planned to do just that.
And on Wednesday, both ends of the Capitol were consumed with news conferences and speeches about the looming bankruptcy of Medicare, something the Clinton Administration testified about last February and an assessment that Congress's own budget office repeated last month. Both political parties have plans to forestall bankruptcy by a few years, but the odds that they will compromise and pass such a fix this year are widely regarded as remote, at best.
Democrats have been grousing all week that the tactic has turned the august chambers into "nothing more than an extension of the Presidential campaign," as Representative David R. Obey, a Wisconsin Democrat, put it today.
Balderdash, say the Republicans. Or as Senator William V. Roth of Delaware said on the Senate floor, shortly after lambasting Democrats for their position on Medicare spending, "Now is the time to put partisanship aside."
Were Republican leaders being partisan, it would hardly be unprecedented, much less one-sided. Democrats have relentlessly hectored Mr. Dole and Republicans in general all spring with an election-year desire to raise the minimum wage.
Nor do Republicans have a lock on issues that the Government cannot or will not do much about. Mr. Clinton has lately stumped the country with a campaign agenda that draws heavily on his support of nighttime curfews for young people and uniforms for schoolchildren and opposition to teen-age smoking.
Still, the rolling roadblock of campaign issues in the House and Senate raises some eyebrows, particularly because so few of the matters at issue stand any chance of being settled before a new Congress is seated next year.
"I haven't seen it quite like this before," Norman Ornstein, one of the deans of Congress-watchers, said in an interview. "I really did expect the that the Republicans who are running Congress would be increasingly nervous about their own re-election bids and would want to start cranking out legislation. The group dynamic just hasn't worked that way."
The purpose in delaying more pressing measures for chats about doomed constitutional amendments and stale Medicare news is obvious. Each highlights one of the infrequent issues on which Mr. Dole and Mr. Clinton vigorously disagree. For Mr. Dole, it also offers a final opportunity to force his Democratic opponents onto the record before he resigns next Tuesday to campaign full time.
The Senate debate on the balanced-budget amendment, a condensed version of last year's battle, did that, obliquely: Mr. Dole called the amendment "the single most important thing we can do to ensure the nation's economic security and to protect the American dream." Mr. Clinton replied by urging Republicans to return to budget talks that broke down in January and "pass the savings we have in common."
"Take the differences between us and then take that to the voters in November," he said.
At the debate's end, 52 of the 53 Senate Republicans voted for the measure, with Mark O. Hatfield of Oregon voting no as he did in March 1995. Only 12 of the 47 Democrats voted yes. Senator Claiborne Pell, Democrat of Rhode Island, did not vote.
Today's House vote on Wisconsin's experiment was the latest tit for tat in the battle over which Presidential candidate is tougher on welfare.
The Wisconsin program -- a five-year experiment referred to as Wisconsin Works or W-2 -- was devised by Gov. Tommy G. Thompson, a Republican often mentioned as a possible running mate for Mr. Dole. It would replace the Federal Aid to Families with Dependent Children program with one that required all parents to work, either in a Government program or in private business, before they could receive benefits.
Republicans have long promoted it as one of the toughest and most radical proposals by any state. But Mr. Clinton pre-empted them some two weeks ago by praising Governor Thompson's program in a radio address, calling it sweeping, bold and encouraging, and broadly suggesting that he would allow it to proceed.
The House bill passed today would pre-empt Mr. Clinton's pre-emption by mandating Federal approval of the Wisconsin plan before Government officials have had a chance to consider it. Sixty Democrats joined all 229 Republicans who voted to approve the measure.
But as a practical matter, the legislation carries more political than legislative importance. Its chances of passing the Senate are dim, legislators say, and Mr. Clinton's aides have indicated that they planned to approve the experiment with but minor changes anyway.
Representative Scott L. Klug, the Wisconsin Republican who led the support of the bill, acknowledged as much. "Obviously there are politics involved," Mr. Klug said after the vote. "We've told the President to lay his cards on the table."
The week's debate eats up lawmaking time when Congress faces a monumental list of bills that it either wants to or must pass. It includes 13 spending bills for the fiscal 1997 budget, proposals to overhaul Medicaid and welfare, campaign finance reform and tax cuts.
Other important bills have been passed but still must weather conference committees, where the House and Senate try to meld their versions into a single law, and then pass both chambers again. Among them are a bill that would let many workers keep their health insurance when changing jobs, and a proposal to toughen laws on illegal immigration.
Congress now has only about 35 days to legislate before its members flee town for a long August recess and some serious campaigning. The rump session after their return in September will be shortened by more campaigning.

CORRECTION-DATE: June 8, 1996, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about Congress's pace in approving legislation referred incorrectly in some editions to the number of votes needed for passage of the balanced-budget amendment in the Senate. The Senate voted 64 to 35, short of the required number by three votes, not two.

HEADLINE: Fears of Debt Have Brought Rejections of Recent Bond Acts

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

DATELINE: ALBANY, June 6

 BODY:
By proposing a $1.5 billion environmental bond act today, Gov. George E. Pataki hopes to win the support of a public that appears to have turned against such measures in recent years because of fears the state has already amassed too much debt.
Voters in New York have endorsed 13 of 21 bond acts since 1958, officials said. The acts authorized the state to spend billions of dollars on various projects, from roads and bridges to commuter railways to water purification plants. But the two most recent bond proposals were both defeated, a fact that was clearly on Mr. Pataki's mind today as he traveled around the state announcing the environmental bond act. He repeatedly described it as fiscally responsible, insisting that the money would not go toward pork-barrel projects. 
 That is a criticism that opponents of earlier bond acts had raised.
In 1992, an $800 million act advocated by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo to finance job creation went down by a heavy margin amid complaints that the state should not take on more debt to reduce unemployment.
And in 1990, voters narrowly rejected the most recent environmental bond act, a $1.98 billion measure that Mr. Cuomo had pushed. Mr. Pataki, a State Assemblyman then, strongly backed that act, cosponsoring the legislation in the State Assembly that put it on the ballot.
The act failed partly because of opposition upstate, where some people feared that the state would use the money to acquire large amounts of land and turn it into parks, stifling development and removing property from local tax rolls. Despite that failure, six other environmental bond measures passed easily between 1960 and 1986. The 1986 act authorized $1.45 billion to close hazardous-waste sites. Voters also supported a $3 billion bond act in 1988 to build roads and bridges and a similar one for $1.25 billion in 1983.
Upstate residents, who tend to be more fiscally conservative, have historically voted against bond acts. But in recent years, as the state's fiscal condition has seemed more dire, opposition has cropped up elsewhere.
New York has among the lowest bond ratings of any state, and a state budget has not been passed on time for 12 straight years. Fiscal monitors have also criticized state leaders for borrowing billions of dollars over the years through public authorities, which often operate with little accountability to the voters.
"People's concerns about the finances of the state make them more skeptical now about borrowing money," said Gerald Benjamin, a historian of state government who is interim dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences at the State University at New Paltz. "There is a negative context toward giving resources to politicians."
Mr. Pataki, a Republican who was elected with strong support upstate, said today that despite the recent misgivings of voters, he believed that he would be able to persuade people around the state that this new act was a wise investment.

In Edgewater, N.J., luxury apartment construction is reviving on the Hudson shoreline.

BYLINE: By Rachael Garbarine 

DATELINE: EDGEWATER, N.J.

 BODY:
By August, work will begin on transforming a patch of the Hudson River shoreline here into a luxury apartment enclave, ending an eight-year dry spell in new residential construction.
The $40 million project, the River Club, will also be the first rental to rise amid the condominium and cooperative developments that dot the 3.5-mile-long old industrial waterfront of this Bergen County borough at the base of the Palisade cliffs, south of the George Washington Bridge. Plans call for 266 one- and two-bedroom apartments in seven brick-and-stucco buildings of three stories. The buildings will be clustered into two groups, framing a courtyard and open space. 
 The Bellemead Development Corporation in Roseland, N.J., a subsidiary of the Chubb Corporation, the insurer and one of the state's larger commercial builders, will develop the River Club with Metropolitan Residential Communities Associates of Englewood Cliffs, N.J. Completion of the project, which has all its local permits but is still awaiting state approval, is set for spring 1998.
It will take shape on 10.7 fallow industrial acres that will undergo an environmental cleanup. The site is sandwiched between the nearly complete 430,000-square-foot Edgewater Commons Mall, which Metropolitan is building, and Independence Harbor, a 520-apartment condominium complex that Hartz Mountain Industries of Secaucus is reshaping from a former Ford Motor assembly plant set on a pier. Hartz once owned all the land where the three projects are rising. Hartz had planned to redevelop the 109 acres into a mixed-use complex, with offices and a hotel, but it sold all but the condominium site.
The River Club illustrates a trend toward rental housing along the Hudson waterfront that could produce thousands of apartments. Over the last 18 months projects have been completed, started or planned in other riverfront communities like Jersey City, Hoboken and West New York in neighboring Hudson County.
Now the activity is spilling into the Bergen County portion of the Hudson's west shore with the Edgewater project. The vacancy for rentals in Edgewater and surrounding towns in Bergen County is about 5 percent, according to the Fort Lee office of Weichert Realtors.
"It's hard to predict what will happen down the road but right now the market is strong and rentals make economic sense," said Robert T. Lapidus, a Bellemead vice president. And with consumer concerns over job security still prevalent "it is less risky," he added.
Other factors, he said, are a borough ordinance that exempts new rental construction from rent control for five years and the site's proximity to Manhattan and mass transit links, including ferry service to New York City from Weehawken. Also the widening of River Road, which parallels the river, is under way after decades of delay to help make the site more accessible.
The River Club is expected to bolster Edgewater's effort to continue its waterfront's revival, which began in the 1980's but was stalled by the recession and sewage and road issues. The revival will help "replace the tax base lost when industries left," Mayor Bryan Christiansen said.
Other riverfront projects are also moving forward, although on a less grand scale than originally conceived. One calls for 36 town houses on a site once planned for a 16-story condominium of 101 apartments. At another site, approved for two 16-story condominium buildings with a total of 240 apartments, as well as 44 town houses, work is starting on just the town houses.
"The lesson learned from the 1980's," Mayor Christiansen said, "is that intense high-rise construction does not work here."
At the River Club, designed by Nadasky-Kopelson of Morristown, the one- and two-bedroom rentals will have 800 to 1,150 square feet of living space. The majority of the larger units will be duplexes. One-third of the units will have direct river views. And following what the National Multifamily Housing Council in Washington calls a growing trend, they will have features often associated with town houses, like fireplaces and washers and dryers.
Monthly rents are expected to average $1,400 to $1,950, with larger apartments near the water costing more. The rents are on par with others in the area, but less than those for similar rentals in Manhattan, and for the condos and co-ops still renting in high-rise buildings in Fort Lee.
Among the recreational features planned are a swimming pool, health club, jogging paths and a public riverfront walkway, the last a state requirement for projects close to the water. There will also be a garage below the buildings. Leasing will begin next fall, Mr. Lapidus said.

South Bronx: Despite Hype, Hope Builds

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ 

 BODY:
TRINITY AVENUE and East 158th Street in the Bronx was once littered with castoffs: charred skeletons of stolen cars, mounds of illegally dumped debris, skinny prostitutes who plied their trade in an abandoned school.
Deserted in the 1970's by many landlords and tenants, this area of Morrisania and Melrose symbolized the South Bronx that the country came to know and loathe. 
 Those streets were abuzz last Saturday as new residents chatted amiably at picnic tables during a celebration to mark the completion of 512 beige and brown private homes and condominiums. Some people tended their tidy green lawns, where statues spouted sparkling trickles of water, while children scooted about, including one giggling tyke on a trike who weaved through an obstacle course of adults.
Recently, the public relations firm of Dan Klores Associates sent out a letter touting a public school program that teaches investment skills to students at a local junior high. The pitch was classic old-school South Bronx, describing the area as being so "poverty stricken" that the chances "anyone could 'beat the street' are slim, and in most cases none."
Please.
"That is such a defeatist attitude," said the Rev. Bert Bennett, an Episcopal priest who helped South Bronx Churches amass $3.5 million in a construction loan fund for the new Nehemiah homes. "Where they see blight, we see potential and opportunity. This was rubble, where nothing could be done. South Bronx Churches organized people and dollars with the community's assistance and said this can change."
THE fact that Bernard Beal, an investment banker, put up the money and the time to help a school in his old neighborhood is commendable. He -- unlike his publicist -- knows the area has rebounded. So it rankles the people who stuck out the bad times to have their community and their neighbors described in stark, hopeless terms. Do good deeds feel better if the beneficiaries are hopeless ragamuffins mired in unbeatable poverty? Must progress be imported, or can it be home-grown?
Felix Santiago was told it was a dangerous place when he moved to the Bronx in 1980. His mother warned him to stay at home. Instead, he went outside and joined South Bronx Churches' nascent organizing effort. He remembers standing on the grim corner of Eagle Avenue and East 156th Street, sweet-talking incredulous neighbors into signing up for the houses that were planned for the site.
He lives on that corner now, inside a $73,000 home he bought on his $20,000 custodian's salary. "I believe that now my family can breathe free," he said. "I don't have to live on Park Avenue to see the Empire State Building. I can see it from my house. It's incredible. Today, everybody breathes respect."
Marjorie Hood, who commutes from the nearby McKinley housing project to her clerk's job on Wall Street, wants to buy a house in Nehemiah's next phase. While the new homes have been a boon to the area's appearance and safety, she said that even in the projects there were tenant leaders working to improve the area. "I can take you to so many families whose children all went to college," she said. "We're just holding on and hanging in there to bring about gains. We're still going on."
BUT so, too, are the images of the South Bronx that have been a backdrop to Presidential campaign stops and more parachuting journalists than the Normandy invasion. While a publicity firm's eagerness to spotlight a good deed may be excused as hype, what explains the poverty of serious accounts?
The Rev. John Grange wondered about that when he read Jonathan Kozol's "Amazing Grace," a relentlessly bleak picture of several South Bronx neighborhoods. Father Grange grew up in Mott Haven, where he is now the pastor of St. Jerome's Roman Catholic Church and involved with the building of new housing.
"I said, 'I'm closing this book because it just ain't real,' " Father Grange said. "It's too melodramatic."
Mr. Kozol concluded in his book that he had no answers for the area's social ills. Perhaps he didn't ask the right questions. Pity isn't the same thing as compassion.
"The structures are not as oppressive as he makes them out to be," Father Grange said. "People are more resilient and able to handle reality than he makes it out to be. I feel good things here."
Like the new homes in Morrisania and Melrose, reclaimed from garbage heaps. Yet the dumping continues. This time, it's liberal guilt that's piling up.

Dollar Advances on U.S. Report Of Solid Job Growth Last Month

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar rebounded from early weakness to end higher yesterday after the Government reported solid job growth in May, pointing to higher interest rates in the months ahead.
The dollar's strength was notable because the strong economic numbers initially alarmed the stock and bond markets, which tumbled over fears that the data portended higher inflation. Such selloffs have weakened the dollar in the past. But the stock market recovered later in the day. 
 Indeed, there was some initial dollar-selling when the Labor Department said the economy created 348,000 jobs last month, more than double what had been forecast.
But dollar buyers emerged, seeing little sign of inflation in the Labor Department's report. Rather, they said the report showed economic stamina and increased the likelihood that the Federal Reserve would soon raise interest rates.
"Certainly the dollar is taking the route that it historically has taken: very good data on the economy as the basis for a stronger dollar," said Cynthia Johnson, managing director of CIBC-Wood Gundy in New York.
In trading in New York late yesterday, the dollar stood at 109.23 yen, up from 108.60 yen earlier in the day and higher than 109.21 yen on Thursday. The dollar rose to 1.5366 marks from 1.5296 marks.
The British pound, which weakened on Thursday after a cut in British rates, fell further yesterday, settling at $1.5380, down from $1.5425.
The dollar weakened as the trading day began, after the Bank of Japan's quarterly business survey showed signs of economic recovery in Japan. The survey aroused speculation that the central bank would soon raise interest rates.
But the dollar began to recover after Masayuki Matsushima, director of the Bank of Japan's research and statistics department, told reporters in Tokyo that it was premature to say Japan's fragile economy was healthy again.
The dollar was under pressure later in the day after Germany's Economics Ministry reported a strong gain in German manufacturing orders for April, suggesting the country might be emerging from an economic slump. The report helped to strengthen the mark, which has been under pressure because of speculation that interest rates in Germany will fall.
But the mark's gains were muted after the president of the Bundesbank, Hans Tietmeyer, was quoted by the financial news agency VWD as saying that a "steady hand" was needed on interest rates.

HEADLINE: Foes Intent On Ousting Colombian

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO 

DATELINE: BOGOTA, Colombia, June 7

 BODY:
Expecting that the Colombian Congress will clear President Ernesto Samper of charges that drug dealers financed his election, the opposition appears to be coalescing and discussing stronger measures to force his resignation.
The Congress, heavily packed with supporters from Mr. Samper's Liberal Party, clearly hopes to end his political turmoil -- and its own -- with a vote to exonerate him. But exoneration by Congress would mean that all constitutional measures to unseat President Samper have been exhausted. 
 Opposition members are said to be weighing economic and political steps to force him to resign, and the threat of violence is never far away.
On Monday the Supreme Court ruled that the congressional vote on the President's fate could not be taken in secret. The court decision, while it is not expected to change the outcome of the vote, will force some degree of public accountability, and probably anger at the Congress. In public opinion surveys, more than 60 percent of Colombians say they believe the President is guilty.
The public vote also leaves legislators vulnerable to prosecution for "neglect of duty," according to an earlier Supreme Court ruling, if they judge the President on political expediency rather than on the weight of the evidence.
The court ruling did not spell out how this would be determined, but it is no idle threat. Heyne Mogollon, chairman of the congressional panel investigating Mr. Samper, is recommending that he be cleared. In the meantime, Mr. Mogollon himself is being prosecuted for dropping a related charge against Mr. Samper.
Hours after the court ruled that the vote must be public, more than 4,000 business leaders -- nearly twice as many as expected -- gathered at a downtown hotel for a meeting of the Movement for National Reconstruction.
Speaker after speaker demanded the President's resignation, and in a final statement the group did not rule out "civil resistance," which has taken on the meaning of a nationwide strike by the business sector to unseat the President.
The meeting, a sequel to earlier ones in Cali and Medellin, came as Washington renewed the prospect of imposing economic sanctions on Colombia. These were permitted when the country was decertified on March 1 as a partner in the fight against drug trafficking.
The Clinton Administration is considering denying landing rights for Colombian planes in the United States and selectively raising tariffs on some products whose export is covered by the Andean Trade Preference Agreement.
A State Department official said on Tuesday that the United States was certain to revoke more visas of Colombians whom American officials consider linked to drug dealers.
Mr. Clinton is likely to expand a list of companies censured last October as being owned by drug dealers. The companies had their United States assets frozen, and were barred from doing business with American concerns.
An expanded list would impose the same restrictions on companies that are being used by drug dealers to launder money or perform other transactions.
"If the Colombian Congress absolves the President," said one United States Congressional source, "there will be very little sympathy in Washington for extending assistance of any kind."
With the tension rising, Mr. Samper, who once held out the possibility of a "dignified exit" after his name was cleared, is now vowing to remain in office.
He has widened divisions between workers and business leaders, his critics say, by taking a populist stand and maintaining that those who wanted him to step down were opposing his commitment to poor and working-class Colombians.
Last month his Labor Minister warned that if business leaders carried out their threat of a nationwide strike, the workers would still show up. The statement was taken as a threat that labor unions would occupy companies whose owners opposed the President.
Some business owners interpreted the statement as suggesting they could lose their businesses, but Pedro Nel Ospina, an economic analyst, said that Colombian law protects their properties and does not allow for unions to take over businesses.
"It's more of a threat in terms of who can mobilize more people, and it opens the way for violence," Mr. Ospina said.
Some businessmen said retired military officers were approached informally to act as go-betweens to sound out the prospects for a "technical military coup." The goals would be to escort Mr. Samper out of the country, install Vice President Humberto de la Calle as head of state and hold congressional elections within 90 days.
The idea has also been pitched by the former Defense Minister, Fernando Botero, in his weekly newsletter, "From My Cell," published in prison.
But these sources said the military had ruled out intervening for the moment, and if soldiers should chose to enter the conflict, it is unclear which side they would serve.
Mr. Botero, once Mr. Samper's campaign manager, is now his most formidable accuser. At the meeting of the business group, guests wore necklaces of plastic elephants, which have become the symbol of Mr. Botero's argument that the donations from drug dealers are too huge to be ignored.
The guests seemed seized by euphoria, like the crowd in a revival tent. Beyond the determination and resounding applause, however, lay trepidation at the prospect of a final clash with the nation's head. Many said they favored a national strike as a last resort -- one that would, to some extent, depend on the severity of any United States sanctions and Mr. Samper's actions if he is exonerated by Congress.
"We can have a strike, but I hope it doesn't turn into a bloody situation," said Sonia Uribe, who works in textiles. "The country is very polarized. It could turn into a bloodbath."
People spoke of reversing a tide of corruption that had seeped into the country over many years, and of which Mr. Samper was, for them, the most obvious product.
"The country has finally taken the lid off a rotten pot that can no longer be covered up," said Alberto Schlesinger, a lawyer. "This is a unique opportunity to correct our sins of the past 25 years."
Rafael Garcia, 39, a surgeon, said: "It's the moral part that's so bad. It's the way you see your country sinking lower every day. There has to be a stop somewhere."

HEADLINE: Israeli Executives Urge Moderation on Netanyahu

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, June 6

 BODY:
Israeli business leaders, who overwhelmingly supported Shimon Peres in the race for Prime Minister, are now urging the more hawkish winner, Benjamin Netanyahu, to show moderation on security issues in an effort to avoid scaring away potential domestic and foreign investors.
Whatever sharp differences Israelis have over how to achieve lasting peace in the region, it is clear that the last few years -- in which peace agreements were reached with Jordan and the Palestinians -- have been golden ones for the economy. And most business people think that is no coincidence. 
 In the last four years, Israel's gross domestic product has risen by 6 percent a year and now stands at $15,500 per person, a figure better than Spain's and just behind Britain's. The extra cash is evident in the 100,000 new cars a year crowding Israel's roads and the cellular phones that seem fastened to almost every ear.
Foreign companies like Volvo, Unilever, Motorola and Intel, enticed by a stable, well-educated Israel and no longer deterred by the Arab boycott, have poured in tens of millions of dollars, multiplying investment at least threefold in the four years that the Labor Party controlled the Government.
And Israeli business people, now peddling computer technology instead of citrus fruit, have seen once-bolted doors opening to them in Southeast Asia and the Middle East.
Nine months ago, for example, Benjamin D. Gaon, president of Koor Industries, Israel's largest holding company, was able to open an office in Indonesia to explore the selling of pesticides. "Being an Israeli was not anymore a liability, it was an asset," said Mr. Gaon.
Given the impact of the lively economy, business people like Mr. Gaon and Ram Caspi, who operates one of Israel's largest commercial law firms, are hoping that Mr. Netanyahu will not carry out to the letter his provocative pledges to keep the Israeli military in the West Bank city of Hebron and close down the Palestinian political office in East Jerusalem called Orient House.
Such actions, sure to provoke an aggressive Palestinian response, would harm the Israeli economy, Mr. Caspi said. Mr. Gaon wrote a letter to shareholders reminding them that "even while catering to his right-wing support block, Netanyahu expressed his intention to respect all outstanding agreements."
Mr. Gaon said in an interview: "You can make statements but at the end of the day people from both sides should feel they are benefiting from improving the state of life because of the peace. The main thing is that there is no problem of uncertainty because the business world hates uncertainty and instability."
An informal business lobby will do its best to rein in Mr. Netanyahu's actions, if not his words. Zalman Shoval, a former Ambassador to the United States who is now chairman of the Bank of Jerusalem and a foreign relations director for Mr. Netanyahu's Likud Party, said the lobby has "egg on its face" because most corporations publicly backed Mr. Netanyahu's opponent, Prime Minister Shimon Peres.
Nevertheless, business people say they will be comfortable with Mr. Netanyahu, a cosmopolitan man who was educated at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and spent many years as a diplomat in the United States. They also like his policy of ridding Israel of its costly vestiges of socialism through more aggressive privatization of companies like the airline El Al.
There are also economic realities that will keep Mr. Netanyahu's strategic policies in check. The incendiary promise he made to spend tens of millions of dollars on expanding Israeli settlements on the West Bank will have to be balanced by the demands of the 700,000 recent immigrants from the former Soviet Union for more housing.
And both those outlays will have to be weighed against the country's need to cut the state budget, which by some calculations consumes 60 percent of the gross domestic product of $87 billion, and to reduce the nation's $10 billion deficit in its international balance of payments.
Clearly, Mr. Netanyahu, whose campaign slogan was "making a secure peace," will not imperil Israel's security just to mollify investors. The Golan Heights, for example, will not be returned to Syria unless there are ironclad safeguards to prevent the artillery shelling from the heights that made daily life unbearable for the Galilean kibbutzim below. And he cannot divide up Jerusalem because the city is sacrosanct in the Israeli consciousness.
But economic experts like Ben-Zion Zilberfarb, a professor of economics at Bar-Ilan University near Tel Aviv, think that Mr. Netanyahu will sidestep some promises, like closing Orient House, that could inflame the Palestinians needlessly.
"He will not do something so provocative as to endanger the political standing of Israel worldwide because this would have implications for trade, which is something we all want," Professor Zilberfarb said.
Mr. Shoval, the head of the Bank of Jerusalem, plays down the role of peace in invigorating the economy, contending that the bigger lift came in the late 1980's with Russian immigration. And he vows that modifications in Mr. Peres's vision for peace will have to be made because Israeli voters, unhappy with the persistent insecurity and terrorism, chose Mr. Netanyahu over Mr. Peres.
"Mr. Netanyahu is going to continue the peace process with or without economic benefits," Mr. Shoval said. "But if you ask me whether he will backtrack on major aspects of his policy because of economic considerations, the answer is no. We don't believe that a policy that could hurt Israeli security in the long run would be helpful to its economy."
Still, Mr. Shoval, too, praises the peace effort and is forthright in saying that it has given foreign investors the solid belief that Israel "could be a good venue from which to do business in the Middle East in general."
Mr. Netanyahu has already shown his concern about business, emphasizing greater privatization in a conciliatory speech to Likud supporters. When the Tel Aviv stock market tumbled after his election, Mr. Netanyahu calmed investors by issuing a statement that the political stability essential to foreign trade was important to him. The market quickly bounced back.
The next indication of how responsive Mr. Netanyahu will be to business concerns will come in his choice of a finance minister. If he appoints a militant like Ariel Sharon, who is passionate about enlarging the settlements, business people will worry about reviving Palestinian tensions. If, however, Mr. Netanyahu appoints a man with true business credentials, like his patron, Moshe Arens, or a moderate like Dan Meridor, former Minister of Justice under the last Likud Government, then business people say they will feel that Mr. Netanyahu's campaign promises were dictated by politics, not by the realities of an increasingly prosperous Israel.
"I believe he understands that the essence of the economy is the peace process," Mr. Gaon said.

HEADLINE: The Unfair War on Alan Greenspan

 BODY:
Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa has single-handedly blocked a vote to confirm Alan Greenspan's reappointment as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. Mr. Greenspan will no doubt be approved, eventually. But the annoying delay could grow worse if, as is now threatened, his confirmation is tied to that of a number of controversial judicial nominations.
The truth is that Mr. Greenspan's record, by testimony of liberal and conservative economists alike, deserves high praise, not Mr. Harkin's thoughtless barbs. 
 Mr. Harkin accuses Mr. Greenspan of needlessly shackling the economy, and there are some economists and businessmen who agree with him. But the record says otherwise.
The economy has grown during seven of the eight years that Mr. Greenspan has led the Federal Reserve Board. Unemployment has steadily declined. So has inflation -- an unusual combination of good outcomes. What Mr. Harkin criticizes is the fact that the steady growth rate has, by comparison with the 1950's and 60's, been relatively slow -- about 2.5 percent per year. Mr. Harkin wants growth of 3 or 4 percent.
The sobering fact is that the Fed has no say over long-term growth and employment. Growth is limited to about 2.5 percent a year because of slow population growth and productivity growth, two trends over which the Fed has almost no control. What the Fed does control is the amount of money circulating through the economy, which determines how fast prices rise. The best way the Fed can make sure the economy grows as fast as possible is to remove the fear of inflation from the decisions to work and invest that are made by ordinary citizens. On that score, Mr. Greenspan's record has been very good.
It is true that the Fed can, when the economy is in a temporary lull, bring down interest rates in an attempt to spur investment and boost economic activity back up to capacity levels. But there are fairly strict limits on how far the Fed can go. At some point -- economists disagree where -- unemployment falls so low that wage and price inflation begin to soar.
Mr. Harkin asserts that the economy could operate without threat of inflation at an unemployment rate well below the current level of 5.6 percent. That may be true. But even if the Fed turned activist, and Mr. Greenspan's critics turned out to be right about inflation, the impact on the economy would be modest and temporary. If, for example, the Fed nudged unemployment down to 4.5 percent, it would mean only that the economy could grow a bit quicker, around 3.5 percent, for about two years. Then growth would slip back down to its long-run potential of 2.5 percent.
A case can be made, in hindsight, that the Fed has erred in the direction of caution the past couple of years. But the errors have been slight and the impact small. The important fact is that Mr. Greenspan has kept the economy on a steady course through turmoil on Wall Street and a war in the Persian Gulf. Mr. Harkin's carping is not just annoying. It is wrong.

HEADLINE: Caught in Milosevic's Web

BYLINE: By Morton I. Abramowitz; Morton I. Abramowitz is president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
When the United States and its partners pulled together the Bosnian peace accord, they tried to ensnare the region's warmongers in a web of peace. Six months later, it's hard to tell who ensnared whom.
The Dayton accord is a tangled web. The President of Serbia, Slobodan Milosevic, who incited and sustained ethnic cleansing and the partition of Bosnia, made the accord possible, but he has not fulfilled his important promises. Last Sunday, he reportedly told Secretary of State Warren Christopher that he cannot remove the Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and Gen. Ratko Mladic, indicted war criminals who foil progress at every turn. 
 Mr. Milosevic has not just damaged Bosnia, he has reduced Serbia to a backwater. The country's gross domestic product has dropped by more than half since 1989, and unemployment is estimated at 30 to 50 percent. He props up the costly state sector and recently dismissed the head of the national bank for refusing to inflate the currency to finance the vast deficits.
Mr. Milosevic has only one interest: staying in power. He has straitjacketed the independent media and oppresses the political opposition. He sees Washington as the arbiter of what happens in the former Yugoslavia. He needs a relationship with us for legitimacy and economic benefits. But he doesn't play the supplicant. He understands the Clinton Administration's political stakes in the Dayton agreement. Emboldened, he has turned aside our paltry efforts to encourage greater freedom -- for example, he closed the Soros Foundation's Belgrade office, which promoted an open society.
Historically, Serbia has been central to Balkan stability. But only a Serbia that promotes democracy and economic reform can insure stability. And stability also requires defusing Serb-Albanian tensions in Kosovo. Mr. Milosevic is not likely to do any of that, except if it is necessary to save his own skin.
Political change could bring someone even worse to power. But it also could help more constructive leaders emerge. While Washington cannot determine Serbian politics, it can start treating Mr. Milosevic differently. The Clinton Administration and the West should stop sending high-level officials to see him. We can condition normalized relations on better treatment of the media and the opposition. We can give far more financial and moral support to struggling democrats. And we can block Serbia's access to international financial institutions until it cooperates with the war crimes tribunal.
Sooner or later, we must face the fact that Mr. Milosevic is poison to the Balkans. Instead of returning the Spiderman's kiss, we better start planning to kiss him off.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE REPUBLICAN;
Dole Attacks The President On Plagiarism And Honesty

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

DATELINE: NASHVILLE, June 7

 BODY:
Bob Dole called President Clinton everything but a liar today, saying the President had "plagiarized" Republican ideas, had given the country "zig-zag leadership" and that voters were "looking for someone to tell the truth."
"The citizens of the greatest nation on earth deserve nothing less than 100 percent honesty from their President," the likely Republican Presidential nominee told a rally of about 300 supporters at the state Capitol here. He said he was resigning from the Senate in part because "telling the truth about Bill Clinton's record is a full-time job." 
 Mentioning a balanced budget and changes in the welfare system, among other issues, Mr. Dole said, "Bill Clinton's promises are like the tape on 'Mission Impossible': they self-destruct in 10 minutes."
Saying again and again that his campaign was "about telling the truth," Mr. Dole gave one of his most stinging speeches against his Democratic rival. His aides believe that "character" is their trump card against Mr. Clinton, who leads Mr. Dole in nationwide public opinion polls, and today's attacks were designed to deliver that message to voters who might not have paid much attention to the race so far.
But it was also laced with humor and phrasing that indicated his speech writers have been working hard to provide the often inexpressive Mr. Dole with some oratorical oomph on the campaign trail.
In homage to this capital of country music, Mr. Dole referred to the President as he quoted a country tune: "You gotta stand for something or you'll fall for anything."
Calling Mr. Clinton the "me-too" candidate for aping his positions, the Kansas Republican said, "You can run down the list of ideas that Bill Clinton has plagiarized from Republicans," citing support for curfews, opposition to same-sex marriage and support for tax credits for adoptions. "If I didn't know better," Mr. Dole said, "I'd think he's trying to be my running mate."
Noting that Mr. Clinton's campaign headquarters in 1992 had displayed a sign saying, "It's the economy, stupid," Mr. Dole said the slogan had lately taken on a new meaning: "Bill Clinton is hoping we're so stupid we won't notice what a mess he's made of the economy."
Even while the President was boasting about the latest jobs numbers in the White House Rose Garden, his Republican rival maintained that the economy had grown 50 percent faster under President George Bush than it had under Mr. Clinton who, Mr. Dole said, had "slammed on the brakes" by signing the largest tax increase in the nation's history. Mr. Clinton's legacy, he added, was "slow growth, high taxes and stagnating wages."
As for his own economic plans, Mr. Dole said he saw nothing incompatible about balancing the budget and cutting taxes. "Make no mistake about it -- we can cut taxes and balance the budget at the same time," he said.
But in the 1980's, when he was chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Mr. Dole did see that approach as inconsistent. Still, he gave no hint about what he might propose when he presents his own economic plan sometime around the Republican convention in August.
Mr. Dole, who is leaving the Senate next week, came to Tennessee a day after saying that he would seek a "declaration of tolerance" in the Republican Party platform on abortion. He made no mention of abortion in his speech today, but he told reporters later that he had issued the statement in an effort to remove the divisive issue from the convention.
"We don't want the convention dominated by the media talking about one issue," he said. "Some of them -- I'm not suggesting you -- like to divide Republicans. They like to spend all their time on that issue."
Mr. Dole, who is lagging behind the President in polls in Tennessee, where Vice President Al Gore, a Tennessean, remains popular, nonetheless told his audience today, "Everywhere I go, I can feel the tide turning." And he told reporters later: "The numbers look pretty good in Tennessee. We're going to win."
Senator Bill Frist, a freshman Republican from Tennessee, said, "People still don't know who Bob Dole is." He said that was because voters here were just coming out of their "bereavement" for the failed Presidential bid of former Gov. Lamar Alexander.
Support for Mr. Alexander "slowed down any movement toward an organization and held in place people who otherwise would have come over," Senator Frist said.
He said Mr. Dole's call on Thursday for a "declaration of tolerance" had already proved to be an important signal to female voters. Senator Frist, a medical doctor who opposes abortion, said that three women's groups he had been working with on health issues had contacted him overnight to express their support for Mr. Dole's statement.
"They said, 'Thank goodness we've had tolerance put on the table,"' Mr. Frist said. "It was just like a sigh of relief," he added, quoting them as saying, "All we've heard is extremism and rigidity."
In line outside the rally here, Brian Harris, 28, carried a sign that said, "Pro-Life, Pro-Dole." He said he was pleased that Mr. Dole had made it clear that Republicans were tolerant of those with different views.
Mr. Dole was to fly from here to Chicago, where he planned to attend the second game of the National Basketball Association finals between the Chicago Bulls and Seattle Supersonics. Mr. Dole, an all-star basketball player in high school who also played in college, said he hoped to meet Michael Jordan, the Bull's superstar. The Senator got a ticket to tonight's sold-out game through Gov. Jim Edgar of Illinois.

HEADLINE: In a Swirling Storm, the Fed Governors Stay Calm

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 7

 BODY:
By 9:15 this morning, when the Federal Reserve Governor Lawrence B. Lindsey arrived at his office, the bond market had already rendered its judgment on the news, released 45 minutes earlier, that employment growth in May was stronger than expected: It sent long-term interest rates sharply higher in the expectation that the Fed would soon tighten monetary policy to cool down an economy at risk of overheating.
By the end of the day, the price of the 30-year Treasury bond was down 112/32 , its biggest decline in two months, driving the yield up to 7.02 percent from 6.89 percent on Thursday. The stock market initially plunged, falling nearly 87 points, then recovered, with the Dow Jones industrial average finishing at 5697.11, up 29.92. 
 But if the financial markets were in a tizzy, Mr. Lindsey, as one of those who will actually set policy when the Fed next meets to consider raising interest rates on July 2 and 3, could afford to be more measured and upbeat in his assessment of the same numbers.
Walking back into his office this morning after returning from a one-day trip to Salt Lake City, he looked at the employment numbers and the market reaction on his computer screen, then scanned the news release from the Labor Department for some of the details. Although the number of jobs created in May was higher than most economists expected, the index of hours worked remained slightly below where it had been in February and March, he noted.
"Not shocking," Mr. Lindsey said. And while he said he would not study the employment report in depth until Monday, he went on to deliver a sanguine analysis of the economy, similar to those of other Fed officials in recent weeks, concluding that the most likely outlook was for a continuation of "sustained moderate growth."
Whether the Fed will raise rates next month remains an open question, and it is unclear whether Mr. Lindsey's assessment means that he would not support a tightening. But a visit with Mr. Lindsey today made clear that if nothing else, there is a big gulf between the way financial markets respond to economic statistics and the way the Fed digests them.
In the markets, the monthly employment report has become the single most important indicator of economic strength, potential inflation and Fed strategy. Over the last few months in particular, traders have been almost fixated on the reports as they seek to discern the inflation outlook and the Fed's policy intentions.
Today's report, showing that the economy created 348,000 payroll jobs in May, prompted an emphatic and nearly instantaneous response in the bond market. News wires and television screens were filled with economists opining that the Fed would almost certainly have to respond, either in July or August, with at least a quarter-point increase in the Federal funds target rate to keep inflationary pressures from taking root.
But for Mr. Lindsey, the employment report was just "one piece of a puzzle," as he put it, and not one that by itself should be the basis for a policy decision.
"To believe that anyone here is going to stand up and say, 'The May employment was such and such, so we're going to have to raise rates,' that's just preposterous," Mr. Lindsey said.
Mr. Lindsey ticked off a series of reasons to be optimistic that the economy would neither overheat nor lapse into recession. The banking system is healthy. While labor markets are tightening somewhat, they don't yet signal any significant inflationary pressures.
Consumer spending, while remaining relatively robust, is unlikely to grow at a strong rate because of high consumer debt levels. Investment by business, which has been running at double-digit rates in recent years, seems unlikely to grow at a faster pace this year and probably will grow considerably more slowly. Government outlays are roughly flat, and net exports seem to be inching down.
"The pieces of the puzzle fall in place best for sustained moderate growth," Mr. Lindsey said.
Trying to divine the Fed's intentions is an industry unto itself, but not a very scientific one. Last week the bond markets tumbled after reading comments by J. Alfred Broaddus Jr., the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, as a signal that the Fed would raise rates. Mr. Broaddus had said the Fed needed to be especially vigilant about inflation with the economy operating near its capacity.
This week, Mr. Broaddus made a series of statements that the markets interpreted more positively. In one, he said that while the risks of the economy overheating had become "more pronounced," there was a roughly equal risk of the economy softening later in the year.
Despite some suspicion in the markets that Fed officials coordinate their public statements to influence the markets deliberately, thereby moving long-term interest rates up and down without making any formal policy decisions, Mr. Lindsey said Fed governors almost never talk to each other about policy between meetings.
"This is the most independent-minded group of curmudgeons assembled in any given place," Mr. Lindsey said. "Curmudgeons don't conspire."
Mr. Lindsey said that it is to be expected that the markets and the Fed would respond differently to economic statistics.
"As an economist I believe that people follow the incentives provided to them, and the incentive provided to traders, who in the short run move the markets, is a trade," Mr. Lindsey said.
"That means exaggerating the importance of any given number. Our incentives here are different."

HEADLINE: A Surge in New Jobs Sends 30-Year Bond Into Tailspin

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Although the bond market was bracing for a strong employment number yesterday, it had not prepared for so large a number, and prices plunged.
The Labor Department reported that 348,000 jobs were added to the economy, nearly double market expectations of 165,000, leaving little room for market participants to argue that the economy was not as strong as it appeared, an argument that the Fed would have to accept to keep interest rates low. 
 By the close of the New York market the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond, down more than 2 points during the session, dropped 1 12/32 to a price of 87 10/32 , sending its yield to 7.02 percent, from 6.89 percent on Thursday.
Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, said the data showed clear-cut broad-based growth.
"Thus far this year the average monthly payroll gain has been 222,000, and over the past three months it has been 223,000," Mr. Fine said. "In my view this clearly puts us in Fed-tightening territory, and the market certainly agrees with that. But there are two issues -- timing and extent."
If the Fed is to tighten, and that is what is called for, Mr. Fine said, then why wait? Recent history has indicated that when the Fed changes direction in its monetary policy its first move is usually by a quarter of a percentage point.
"It's not a matter of making forecasts about future economic activity," Mr. Fine said. "It's the Fed's job to insure that inflation does not accelerate." Consequently, based on yesterday's data, he added, the Fed should tighten, pushing up rates.
Before the release of the latest labor statistics, economic numbers had been somewhat mixed, indicating moderate growth, but in no way suggesting a boom.
"At first glance these numbers looked as if they were for another country," Mr. Fine said, "but after all the revisions, the market has come to view the economy as more to the strong side. The veil has been lifted from the market's eyes. The probability of a future Fed tightening at the next F.O.M.C. meeting in early July is certainly a possiblity."
Jack Regan, chief investment strategist at Josepthal, Lyon & Ross, said the strong number was forcing many people to rethink their positions.
"However, I wouldn't be surprised to see the market get oversold and perhaps bounce back ahead of more economic data due next week," he said, even though the bounce could be short-lived.
"This could allow for some bottom- picking in both bonds and stocks as prices cheapen," he added.
The data raised market expectations that the strong second quarter would carry over into the second half of the year, analysts said, possibly pointing toward a 4 percent rate of growth in the second quarter.
Mr. Regan noted that next month's Federal Open Market Committee meeting will be on July 2 and 3, just before the Fourth of July holiday. The market may get its answer about how the Fed will respond as early as the morning of July 3.
Ken McCarthy, founder of the Economic Intelligence Company, a New York based research and analysis firm, said he thought the financial markets were overreacting to an economy that is experiencing a revival in growth without any significant inflationary pressures. In fact, he said, "since it is inflation that drives the Fed's decisions and should set the levels of interest rates, the lack of inflationary pressure indicates to us that the Fed will not act to raise rates any time soon."
Mr. McCarthy contends that the sharp increases in rates that the financial markets generated in the first six month of 1996 just about assure that the economy will slow in the second half of the year.

HEADLINE: A Surge in Jobs Shows Strength In the Economy

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 7

 BODY:
Employers added twice as many workers as had been expected to their payrolls in May, Government figures showed today, giving new signs that the economy has been picking up momentum. The report sent interest rates soaring and raised fears on Wall Street that the Federal Reserve might move soon to slow growth to prevent a jump in inflation.
Business activity was so strong that economists were increasing their growth forecasts for the second quarter. And more than a half million additional people were drawn into the labor force. But since only two-thirds of them promptly found jobs, the unemployment rate edged up to 5.6 percent, the midpoint of the narrow range in which it has drifted since late 1994. 
 Statistics like these generally attract most notice in the financial markets, but the report was issued as the Presidential campaign turned to a debate over which candidate was more competent on economic matters.
The Clinton Administration hailed the report, the first broad view of economic performance for the month, as further evidence of good stewardship, noting that 9.7 million jobs were created since President Clinton took office. And the President said there should be no need for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates.
"We have been given fresh evidence that the American economy is growing steady and strong," he said in briefing reporters in the Rose Garden. "When we make tough choices, there is absolutely no limit to what the American people can do to create jobs and opportunity."
Senator Bob Dole, who has the Republican nomination locked up, ignored the good news and bitterly attacked the President's economic programs. Noting that Mr. Clinton's campaign slogan in 1992 had been "It's the economy, stupid," Mr. Dole said that slogan had lately taken on a whole new meaning. "Bill Clinton is hoping we're so stupid, we won't notice what a mess he's made of the economy," he said.
On Wall Street, the surge of 348,000 jobs added to nonfarm payrolls set off volatile trading. Bond prices tumbled and the stock market also fell sharply as long-term interest rates surged over 7 percent in early trading. But after falling nearly 87 points, the Dow Jones industrial average rebounded, in part because strong growth could translate into better corporate profits. The Dow closed up nearly 30 points and bonds recovered a little, with the yield on the 30-year bond finishing at 7.02 percent.
Today's labor report was the latest in a now substantial list of data indicating that the economy's near-stall early this year had turned into robust growth -- except for manufacturing. Though that sector is no longer shedding jobs, it is not adding them either.
Housing has been surprisingly strong in the face of rising interest rates, and confident shoppers have depleted stores to the point that production will probably need to be stepped up to replenish them. Some analysts have already raised their estimates of economic growth for the second quarter to a rate of 4 percent or more, compared with 2.3 percent in the first three months of the year.
Another sign of strength has been a steady weekly decline this spring in the number of people making first-time claims for unemployment benefits.
The Labor Department's monthly job surveys were bolstered by a poll conducted by the National Federation of Independent Business, whose members reported a big jump in hiring last month and a record high percentage of companies reporting at least one opening they have been unable to fill.
The 348,000 payroll expansion last month was not only about twice as large as expected by most economists but it came on top of a sizable upward revision of figures for April. The revised figures lifted the April gain to 163,000 from a scant 2,000.
This job expansion "increases the likelihood that the Fed will be tightening sometime this summer," the Morgan Guaranty Trust company told clients.
Nearly all the May job gains were in services, with 48,000 new jobs in temporary help, 46,000 in department stores and other retail trade, 39,000 in health services, 22,000 in engineering and management services, 20,000 in finance, insurance and real estate and 10,000 in what had been a flat food-store sector.
Most of a 43,000 expansion in local- government jobs, however, represented people hired for the day as poll watchers for primary elections.
Factory jobs inched up 6,000 after having dropped 282,000 from their most recent peak in March 1995. Construction employment rose 28,000, about the same as the average increase since October. The index of aggregate weekly hours edged up just two-tenths of a point, to 135.4, slightly below its February and March readings, reflecting lackluster factory activity.
Included in the overall payroll expansion were 143,000 jobs assumed to have been generated at new companies or otherwise not yet picked up by the data collectors.
Average hourly earnings, which in April unnerved analysts by rising 7 cents, to $11.75, were unchanged, the result of a 3-cent downward revision for April and an offsetting 3-cent increase for May.
Today's payroll figures also include the annual benchmark revision in which Federal survey estimates are reconciled with actual counts of state unemployment records, a process that raised the March 1995 reference month by 542,000 jobs. Revised seasonal adjustment factors were also incorporated as well as new methodology, accounting for about 20,000 May jobs, which now adjusts for the fact that about four times a year the survey period covers five weeks instead of the usual four weeks.
The Labor Department's survey of households uncovered an exceptionally large 549,000 surge in the civilian labor force, probably reflecting greater optimism about the chances of finding a job.
But while 367,000 of these re-entrants, school-leavers and others, found work, 182,000 did not and this nudged up the unemployment rate to 5.6 percent from 5.4.

HEADLINE: HEALTH CARE BILL FAILS OVER DISPUTE BETWEEN PARTIES

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 7

 BODY:
Health insurance legislation, hailed six weeks ago by Senator Bob Dole as proof that Congress could overcome election-year stress to help ordinary Americans, foundered today on sharp disputes among Republicans and between Republicans and Democrats.
The unpredictability of late-session Congressional behavior means that the measure is still barely alive. But today's developments appeared to doom the first serious effort at the kind of incremental health care change that politicians of both parties proclaimed would be preferable to the sweeping changes President Clinton proposed and Congress killed in 1994. 
 Mr. Dole intervened personally today for the first time in discussions on the bill, whose central purpose is to make it easier for American workers to keep their health insurance coverage if they change or lose their jobs.
When he was finished, Republicans still wanted to include the creation of tax-deductible medical savings accounts, a provision that many Democrats have all along said would doom the measure.
Mr. Dole, the majority leader and apparent Republican Presidential nominee, has frequently insisted that he wants the bill passed before he resigns from the Senate on Tuesday, and his desire to exit on a note of triumph has been counted on to help it. Mr. Dole himself told reporters on Thursday, "I'm afraid if I leave and it's not done, it might not happen."
This afternoon Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat who co-sponsored the bill with Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum, Mr. Dole's fellow Kansas Republican, told the Senate that by keeping a broad provision or medical savings accounts in the bill, "Dr. Dole is prescribing a poison pill for this consensus legislation," which the Senate passed 100 to 0 on April 23.
Mr. Kennedy's attack today came after he had bottled his complaints about Mr. Dole on Wednesday and Thursday at the request of Mrs. Kassebaum, who pleaded with him not to raise the temperature of the debate because she still had high hopes for a compromise.
Mr. Kennedy and the Clinton Administration argue that savings accounts, which provide tax-free savings to pay for ordinary medical expenses for people who buy policies with high deductibles to cover catastrophic illness, would appeal chiefly to well-off, healthy people and who would leave traditional insurance plans, raising rates for those who remain.
Supporters like Mr. Dole contend they would give consumers more choices and help stem the medical inflation by making patients more cost-conscious. Despite his support, medical savings accounts were not included in the Senate bill, but the House bill adopted them and Mr. Dole said he hoped they would be included by a House-Senate conference committee.
As a compromise, the Administration and Mr. Kennedy have proposed various pilot projects for the savings accounts to test whether their fears or the proponents' hopes have merit. But today Ari Fleischer, spokesman for the House Ways and Means Committee, said any such geographic limits would be "silly and arbitrary."
Senator Kassebaum left Washington this afternoon after the Dole meeting. Her press secretary, Mike Horak, who is as gently spoken as she is, offered a soft but recognizable echo of Mr. Kennedy when he said: "It's unfortunate that we cannot reach agreement on a bill that can pass the House and Senate and be signed into law. We are not there yet."
White House officials insisted the Republican plan was excessive. "It simply goes too far," said George Stephanopoulos, senior adviser to the President, "It is certainly not a demonstration project."
The House measure would allow immediate establishment of the savings accounts. As a compromise, Republicans have offered to limit them, for now, to people working in companies with 50 or more employees -- an estimated 80 million workers -- and then allow anyone to have such an account.
John Hilley, assistant to the President for legislative affairs, said, "Our requirement is that the M.S.A.'s be tested in a demonstration project before they are allowed to go forward." He said: "It's not a matter of numbers. It's a matter of testing a new program."
But Republicans argued that it was Mr. Kennedy, and not the Clinton Administration, who was fighting the savings account plan.
"Ted Kennedy does not run the world," Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, Mr. Dole's deputy leader, said today. "We can never pacify him."
He said he hoped that Senator Kassebaum would agree to the proposal next week, because "If she can accept it, then we can pass it, and hopefully the President can sign it."
He continued: "He needs to give it up and support the language in that bill. We can get portability, we can get pre-existing conditions. We can get the beginnings of M.S.A.'s."
Mr. Kennedy said, "President Clinton will veto any bill that tries to impose this untried and dangerous approach on the country."
He attacked Mr. Dole for what he said was a caving in to "the intransigence of House Republicans." But Mr. Dole himself has advocated the savings account plan, and lost narrowly, 52 to 47, when he tried to put it into the Senate bill. He said the accounts would enable anyone "to tailor his or her own health care to his or her own needs."
Still, if the measure languishes, Democrats are sure to make it an issue against Mr. Dole in the Presidential campaign, for on April 18 he praised it, telling the Senate: "Common sense has finally prevailed. For nearly a decade now, Republicans have been trying to pass an incremental health insurance bill that would solve many of the problems with the availability and affordability of health insurance."
"Passage of this bill will not only improve our health care system," Mr. Dole said then. "It could very well restore the faith of the American public that the work of Congress is not just a series of political stalemates. Even in an election year, we can work on a bipartisan basis to pass legislation that will improve the lives of so many Americans."
House Republicans like Representative Bill Archer of Texas, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, and Speaker Newt Gingrich himself are very enthusiastic about medical savings accounts, but when the House passed the bill on March 28, Mr. Gingrich said: "If the President sends up a veto signal, we are not going to risk vetoing coverage for all Americans in medical savings accounts, but we want to make the case. We want to try to convince him that he ought to be willing to sign it."
When Tony Blankley, Mr. Gingrich's spokesman, was asked if that was still the Speaker's view today, he would not say yes or no.
Instead, Mr. Blankley said, the President should just sign the bill.

HEADLINE: Russia Vote Is a Testing Time For a Key Friend of Clinton's

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 7

 BODY:
Nelson Strobridge Talbott 3d, Deputy Secretary of State, Russia expert, renowned journalist and graduate-school classmate of Bill Clinton, stopped dead in front of a television.
With the June 16 first round of the Russian election approaching fast, the puffy face of Boris N. Yeltsin was on the screen. 
 "What's that?" Mr. Talbott asked urgently. Mr. Yeltsin, it turned out, was fine, simply making another campaign pledge.
Victoria Nuland, the very organized executive assistant to the chronically disorganized Mr. Talbott, laughed and asked sweetly, "Are we tense?"
It is a testing time these days for Mr. Talbott, who goes by the name Strobe.
He is wholly identified with the Clinton Administration's policy toward Russia, the reason President Clinton brought him into government. While Mr. Yeltsin may win re-election, a victory by the Communist Party leader, Gennadi A. Zyuganov, would be a huge blow to the Administration's reputation for foreign-policy management, and to Mr. Talbott personally. In a debate about "who lost Russia," Mr. Talbott, fairly or not, would be a favorite culprit.
The Administration's policy has shifted as conditions in Russia have changed, and it now concentrates more on managing Russia than trying to reinvent it on the Western model. There is more emphasis on security issues and NATO expansion.
But Mr. Talbott and Mr. Clinton have put their bets regularly on Mr. Yeltsin, much as Mr. Clinton invested his prestige in the failed re-election campaign of the Israeli Prime Minister, Shimon Peres. They have tried not to undermine Mr. Yeltsin, supporting him with American and International Monetary Fund loans, advice and patience, despite economic swings, policy shifts, tank attacks on Parliament and the war in Chechnya.
Officially, American policy supports "democratic and market reform," not personalities, and the Administration has had contacts with nearly all Russian opposition movements. But Washington has decided that Mr. Yeltsin is the only "reformer" with a chance of beating Mr. Zyuganov.
While Mr. Talbott has become "more hard-headed" about Russia's difficulties, "he is still a romantic at heart about Russia," a department critic said. "The problem is, he has no deep sense of real life and real interests. It's all romance with him. It's less now, but that's the main problem with this Russian policy."
In the State Department, among Secretary of State Warren Christopher's small inner circle, there is much more disagreement about Russia and its intentions. There is also more internal criticism about the Talbott line of steady support for reform in Russia and patience with its messy transition from Soviet Communism.
Other branches of the Government, especially the Pentagon, are concentrating more on what may be required to "contain" a neo-Communist Russia if it gets aggressive, and a willingness to confront Moscow on issues ranging from compliance with treaties on biological and chemical weapons to Russian arms sales and nuclear cooperation with Iran and China. There is less concern with market reform and democratization, which Mr. Talbott and Mr. Christopher still regard as crucial for Russia's external behavior.
As "the ground of Russia has changed, Strobe's views have changed, too," said a colleague, who like others requested anonymity.
 
An Early Love Of Russian Culture
With a love of the Russian language and literature that began at prep school, Mr. Talbott arrived at Yale already fluent, and only later got into the politics of bureaucracy and arms control.
There are two kinds of Russian experts, said Angela Stent, professor of government at Georgetown University, who like nearly every American in Russian studies knows Mr. Talbott. One group believes that "Russians are genetically incapable of taking political and personal responsibility." This group has "already written off Russia, saying it's all gone wrong, and they call themselves realists," she said, adding: "So what we do is defend ourselves and don't try to engage them and don't really care what happens inside."
Then there are those like Mr. Talbott "who believe that despite all the difficulties, you should engage with the Soviets, encourage the best features of the society and try to work out the best relationship you could," she said.
Mr. Talbott's bottom line, she and others agree, is to stand "for engagement at a minimum and partnership wherever possible." The charge of romanticism stems largely from overly optimistic predictions, which Mr. Talbott was not alone in sharing, about how smoothly and quickly Russia might make its transition.
"We developed a kind of paternalistic feeling and treated them as teen-agers, and to the extent they followed our guidance, we became overly protective," said Dimitri Simes, president of the Nixon Center. "We should tell the truth to ourselves and themselves about some of the more disagreeable aspects of Russian foreign-policy conduct."
"I think his self-confidence was a little misplaced," he said of Mr. Talbott. "And the combination of his 'I know it all' phenomenon and his closeness to the President and his bureaucratic skills undermined the normal analytic procedure of policymaking."
Even now, Mr. Yeltsin's Russia is less friendly toward the United States, more nationalistic and rhetorically aggressive -- "there's more scratchiness in the relationship," in Mr. Talbott's words. It is unclear what a Yeltsin victory could mean for American policy in Russia, particularly if he keeps his election promises and re-ignites high inflation.
What Russia would be like in a second Yeltsin term, let alone what a Communist presidency might mean, preoccupies Mr. Talbott and his high-ranking, inter-agency Policy Steering Group, which he has headed since the office of Ambassador to the Newly Independent States was created for him. Meeting regularly, the Rump Group, as it is called, works out the operational details of policy on the former Soviet Union, from what stance to take on an issue to what reaction should be given to the press.
After becoming Deputy Secretary in December 1993, handing the Newly Independent States job to his deputy, James Collins, Mr. Talbott has kept "the Russia account." Given his closeness to Mr. Clinton, one of Mr. Talbott's critics suggests, it is no accident that in the whole term there has only been one meeting of the President, Mr. Christopher and his Cabinet-level colleagues on Russia policy, and that was in February, to discuss the possibility of a Communist presidential victory.
Some in the Government say they think that his new job of Deputy Secretary, as Mr. Talbott and Mr. Christopher have defined it -- with responsibility for Bosnia, Haiti, Latin America, Africa and other matters -- means that Mr. Talbott cannot keep up as before with Russia and the other former-Soviet states.
On the issue of enlargement of NATO, vigorously supported by would-be members in Central Europe but viewed by Russia as an intolerable threat to its security, Mr. Talbott has shifted, through an on-going internal debate that he largely lost.
In 1993, he agreed with NATO expansion in principle, but wanted it to move very slowly, with a prime emphasis on a deep partnership with the emerging Russia. "Over time," said a colleague who is less sympathetic to Russian discomfort, "it became clearer and clearer to Strobe how central expansion of NATO is to European security, and he's become much more outspoken about it."
Richard C. Holbrooke, the former Assistant Secretary of State and a close friend of Mr. Talbott's, said that once Mr. Talbott's portfolio was enlarged beyond Russia, he quickly understood the value of NATO in stabilizing Central Europe. "As the former Time bureau chief for Eastern Europe, he was the only one on the seventh floor who had ever actually lived there," Mr. Holbrooke said.
Moreover, Mr. Holbrooke said, the rising profile of the Communists and nationalists in Russia convinced Mr. Talbott that it was better to have a methodical NATO expansion under way now rather than react abruptly if Russia turned more menacing.
 
Loss of Control On NATO Is Seen
Stephen Sestanovich of the Carnegie Endowment, a former National Security Council aide to President Reagan, saod he believes that Mr. Talbott "lost control of the NATO policy" in 1994. Mr. Sestanovich regards rapid NATO expansion as bad policy, throwing out of whack the "very risky" Clinton effort "to balance policies that don't go together very well: partnership and containment."
Some officials say Mr. Talbott was slow to recognize the importance of a full range of relations with key non-Russian nations, especially Ukraine, because of Moscow's sensitivities. But the same people give him the credit for a lasting success in getting Ukraine to agree to give up nuclear weapons and sign on to an International Monetary Fund program.
On Russia as well as Haiti and Bosnia, Mr. Talbott is described as a strong proponent of steadiness and keeping to long-term policy goals despite the swings of daily events.
While he was criticized for caution on military intervention in Bosnia out of concern for Russian reaction if NATO should use force, he is also described as steadier than some others, urging the use of American air power and troops there as well as in Haiti, "while others were flapping around, not so attractively," an official said.
 
The 'One Person The President Calls'
Mr. Talbott, who is 50, attributes his position in large measure to what he calls the "particularly bizarre biographical accident" of being Bill Clinton's housemate at Oxford University.
Thomas E. Donilon, Mr. Christopher's chief of staff and a proponent of rapid NATO expansion, once said of Mr. Talbott to a colleague: "I may fight with him over Russia, but there's only one person in this building the President calls Sunday night to see how he's doing, and that person isn't Warren Christopher."
But according to colleagues, a large part of his strength in the bureaucracy comes from his journalistic skills -- his fierce curiosity, his analytical talent and his knack for that underrated weapon of bureaucratic influence: the concise, well-worded memo.
"Everyone focuses on two things about Strobe -- Russia and his roommate," said Mr. Holbrooke, himself a former reporter. "They forget what he really is: He's a journalist."
Mr. Talbott says one of his biggest adjustments from journalism is to understand how thoroughly collaborative policymaking is. "I disagree with myself three times a day," he said. "So it's hardly surprising that I disagree with half-a-dozen colleagues on a fairly regular basis. But we end up with better policies."
Even one critic of Mr. Talbott describes him as "the most accessible and most decisive person up there," one who will clear his desk, if necessary, to solve a crisis or get a memo read. Mr. Christopher, by contrast, keeps to a more rigid schedule giving him little time, he says, for "ruminative conversations."
One of Mr. Talbott's bureaucratic innovations has been a weekly luncheon meeting of deputies of his rank to coordinate policy. It includes one of his closest friends in Government, Samuel R. Berger of the National Security Council; John White of the Pentagon; Leon Furth of Vice President Al Gore's staff, and John M. Deutch, the Director of Central Intelligence, a holdover from his days as Pentagon deputy.
These meetings are an indication of the way that Mr. Talbott has used personal contact and discussion to make himself an important policy player and insure its coordination.
 
Consensus-Building And Note-Writing
He is also a writer of personal notes of the kind beloved by President George Bush, another well-reared child of Republican parents and an education at prep school and Yale.
"Strobe writes a lot of notes," an official said. "He passes notes to people in meetings -- not snide ones, but 'great job three days ago' or 'come talk to me.' He invites people to dinner, he calls them, he shows deep solicitude.
"He works very hard to reach a consensus," the official continued. "He works hard to bring people in, and he doesn't let them stray. He values consensus, and he hates it when consensus breaks down, when some go to Christopher or Lake or the President with a different view." Anthony Lake is Mr. Clinton's national security adviser.
Still, he is described by Mr. Christopher and even his critics as a loyal deputy and a scrupulous presenter of others' views, making him, in some eyes, a perfect candidate for national security adviser for his President friend in a second term. That is one reason Mr. Talbott has an edgy relationship with Mr. Lake, who has widely expressed his desire to remain in the job.
Whatever Mr. Talbott's ambitions, he has avoided competing with his boss.
"He's been scrupulous about his loyalty to me," Mr. Christopher said. "He's not tried to supplant me. He has been rigorous in coming around and making sure he's following my lead. Some people thought he would be a mixed blessing, but I've not found him so."

HEADLINE: Connecticut Q&A: Leslie N. Corey Jr.;
Saving the Land When Money Is Scarce

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON 

 BODY:
THE executive director of the Connecticut chapter of the Nature Conservancy for 10 years, Leslie N. Corey Jr., is leaving the job this month to take over as head of the organization's Arizona chapter.
The last decade has been one of the most intense periods of growth in the Connecticut chapter's history. It has almost doubled its holdings, adding 11,266 acres of land in more than 300 transactions, and membership has grown to 17,752. 
 Mr. Corey, 46, a vice president of the national organization, has been involved in New England land preservation issues for more than 20 years. He holds a master of forest science degree from the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, and did his undergraduate work in environmental biology at Southern Connecticut State University -- where he helped organize the first observance of Earth Day in 1970.
During a recent interview at his office in Middletown Mr. Corey discussed the Conservancy's accomplishments, and what remains to be done. Here are some excerpts from that conversation.
Q. What was the Conservancy's main achievement in your 10 years?
A. Embracing a project the scale of Tidelands of the Connecticut has been a major accomplishment. The work we did in Tidelands has been sort of a community-based approach to conservation, which we are very proud of. Let's face it, enlightened self interest is a very powerful motivator, so if we can ignite that spark, bring good science and a practical approach to balancing economic development and conservation, we've done our job.
We've also examined how we go about our conservation work. Historically, we created preserves, and managed them. Now we recognize that if we're going to be successful in preserving habitats and species, we've got to go beyond the individual preserve approach, we've got to look at the communities and the landscapes within which those preserves exist. Really it's taking a holistic approach to conservation.
 Q. How else have the Conservancy's goals changed in 10 years?
A. The other thing that has changed is the scale on which we plan our work. Instead of planning on a state by state basis, we're planning on a whole ecological-regional basis: the New England maritime province, the Appalachian corridor. We're looking at larger contexts that scientists have defined based on geography and geology. Across the United States there are 60 some-odd ecoregions that have been identified, and we're going to be using them to plan our conservation agenda, so we're using the boundaries of nature for our planning efforts.
Q. Are there any of those ecoregions in Connecticut?
A. One place we're going to be doing more work in is northwestern Connecticut, the northern highlands, working in partnership with the Massachusetts and New York State programs. The region spills into the Berkshires and into the Taconic Range. We'll be doing more in terms of mapping and scientific surveys, the way we did with Tidelands.
Q. The Connecticut chapter has several very small preserves, some just a couple of acres. How do those fit in with the new strategy?
A. We've worked to nurture local land trusts, and we've identified some preserves that weren't essential to the Conservancy; they didn't have critical habitats or rare species, and can be adequately managed by local land trusts. Where we can, we've been transferring those properties to land trusts. We have done that with more than 60 preserves.
Now when a piece of land is made available to us that doesn't fit our criteria, oftentimes it will go directly to the land trust. It allows for the preservation of local farmland or scenic areas that are important to the rural nature of a community, but it's done by a land trust.
Q. What type of land would you most like to see added to the Connecticut inventory?
A. We have identified several thousand acres of habitat. One of the things we have to address is the need to put together large blocks of habitat in places, for example, like the Falls Village and Robbins Swamp in Canaan Mountain, where there is the opportunity to bring together several thousands acres. We're struggling to bring together the money now to do it. It's some of the most important inland wetlands in the state.
There are several sites along the Connecticut River that we would really like to see protected, but either the landowners have set unrealistic prices or they're not on the market.
Q. How long can the Conservancy sustain the growth rates of the last 10 years?
A. I don't have a crystal ball in terms of institutional growth, but as long as the Nature Conservancy remains flexible in its approach, and constantly re-evaluates how it pursues its mission, as long as we can be resilient, we will continue to grow. If we become a stodgy bureaucracy, resistant to change, we won't.
Membership is still less than a half of a percent of the population. I'd like to believe there's more than a half-percent of Connecticut residents who subscribe to our mission and the philosophy of the organization, but it's very hard to reach out to them. It takes time.
Q. What kind of goals should be set for 10 years from now?
A. Much bigger than I've set, I hope. I think the chapter is uniquely positioned to have an impact not just in Connecticut, but around the world. We can help major Conservancy projects outside our borders, and it should be part of our objective to encourage that. There are some tremendous conservation challenges outside of the United States that are really important.
Q. But do you run the risk that people will become more interested in saving the rain forest than a mudwort along the Connecticut River?
A. What I find is just the opposite. It sort of enriches people's feelings towards conservation. People tend to invest here first, and then make an additional investment elsewhere, especially in countries where they don't have the resources we have.
Q. Are there any opportunities you feel you've missed?
A. I wish that we could have had more of an impact on the political leadership of Connecticut. We've worked very hard to get about $60 million in bond funds over the last 10 years for preservation. The State Department of Environmental Protection has added more than 11,000 acres to its holdings over the last 10 years.
But D.E.P. has a longstanding goal of protecting about 10 percent of the land in Connecticut, 300,000 acres, and they're only at about 220,000 acres now. The need, determined by an independent task force, was for about $20 million a year. We never were able to get to that level of funding. And now the program is being shrunk down to, basically, nothing.
I understand the tremendous competition for funding, for human service needs and all of the other demands. But to me it's prudent to be investing a few million dollars a year in the heritage of the state.
Q. Is the public as serious about environmental issues as it was during the first Earth Day in 1970?
A. Yes and no. I think people understand that the environment needs to be a priority, right up there with education and health care. But when it absolutely translates into getting appropriations for this or that, I don't think the urgency is there.
The urgency is there if you've got a toxic waste dump in your backyard. But when you're talking about preserving important habitat or important pieces of our landscape heritage, I don't think there's the same sense of urgency.
What we need here is some leadership at the top. I think people would support it. Wherever I go in the state, people ask me, "Why isn't the state doing more?" I think there are a lot of people who would support a larger investment, but they're not out there writing letters every day, or screaming at public hearings.
Q. You've done some extensive, expensive biological inventories in Fairfield County and along the Connecticut River. Were there any surprises that came out of them?
A. There weren't too many surprises. What we're getting a better handle on is not just the location of species, but updating records for species occurrences and describing natural communities. We're not just about saving species, although that's one way you can measure your progress. The real emphasis has to be investing in the landscapes that have the highest concentrations of biological diversities.
When you have scarce resources, you ought to be getting the most biological bang for the buck. Working at that ecosystem level gives us more leverage in protecting not just individual species, but evolutionary processes, and the health of the entire ecosystem.

HEADLINE: PRACTICAL TRAVELER;
Hotels a Little Like Home

BYLINE: By BETSY WADE 

 BODY:
ALL-SUITE hotels are springing up like beanstalks. They are designed for travelers who stay a while -- for sales conferences, for training courses or while house-hunting after a job change. The most common version has one bedroom, but studios and two-bedrooms are also available.
The hotel industry sees this as an area of growing demand; both established companies such as Marriott of Washington and new ones such as Platinum Suites in Florida are building suites. One company, Homestead Village of New Mexico, has 27 properties operating and 53 under development. 
 These lodgings also have advantages for families on vacation who are concerned with both saving money and getting a little privacy after the children's lights-out.
These families are in the majority of travelers, according to the Travel Industry Association of America. The association's new survey, made jointly with the Automobile Association of America, shows that 54 percent of vacation travelers will be taking children along this summer, a rise of seven points over last year, and although families will be taking longer trips, they will limit their spending pretty much to last year's level, meaning there will be many economies. A telephone shopping trip among all-suite hotels may turn up a good opportunity, even if the location is not the one of your dreams.

 
 
New Chains Coming
 All-suite properties nationwide totaled 337 with 40,400 rooms in a recent count by Smith Travel Research of Gallatin, Tenn. About 12 new chains are on the way. Suite hotels are often in the suburbs, particularly around malls and office-industrial parks. While such sites may not be historic, scenic or quaint, all-suite hotels are likely to have swimming pools and health-club facilities where families can relax after sightseeing or visiting relatives. And kitchens are a given.
Most places have been built for this specific purpose, but a few have been converted and may contain irregular layouts. Because of this possibility, families should ask at reservation time about features they want, particularly a foldout sofa in the living room area. Where the price is very low, it usually means few amenities, such as maid service only weekly. Here is information on five leading all-suite chains.
Homewood Suites are franchised or owned by the Promus Company of Memphis. There are now 33 properties, mostly franchised, and there will be 45 by year's end, according to Jim Holthouser, a spokesman for the company. The properties are scattered, with more than one each in Florida, Georgia, Indiana, North Carolina, Ohio and Texas.
Homewood Suites have bedrooms with doors that shut, plus convertible couches in the main living area. The kitchens include stovetops. There are no restaurants, but a free breakfast buffet is set out in the common area and refreshments are provided during a social hour in the afternoon. The properties include convenience stores, fitness centers and swimming pools. Free local transportation is provided. This chain's price is near the upper end: an average of $83 a night. The price is not discounted for a longer stay although Mr. Holthouser said that in a competitive area, the weekend price might be lower. Homewood Suites reservations: (800) 225-5466.
Studio Plus is a low-cost brand. The company, in Lexington, Ky., has 26 properties, and expects to have 35 by the end of the year. The company owns all its properties, which are in Lexington, Indiana, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina and Tennessee, usually on the periphery of a residential area.
The suites do not have a separate bedroom, but a bed in an alcove off the main room. There is also a foldout couch. The kitchen includes a full stove. The properties have pools, laundry rooms and fitness areas, but no stores or restaurants. "There is no free breakfast," said Rick Bubenhofer, director of marketing. "We're about saving money."
However, Studio Plus has benefits for the leisure traveler, since it does offer swimming pools. Homestead Village, another economy property, rents by the week only and has no pools.
Mr. Bubenhofer of Studio Plus said that 90 percent of hischain's guests stayed a week or longer, and the price is offered on a weekly basis, with the rates representing nightly averages of $35 to $50. On the weekend, a nightly rate might be $48 to $51. Studio Plus reservations: (800) 646-8000.
Amerisuites are owned by the Prime Hospitality Corporation of Fairfield, N.J. According to John M. Elwood, the executive vice president, the chain is designed for business travelers, but not those making long stays; his guests stay an average of two to three nights. There are 25 properties, widely scattered, with a large number opening this year.
The Amerisuite bedroom is partitioned, but does not have a door; there is a foldout sofa in the living area. The kitchen has a microwave but no stovetop. All the sites in the South have heated pools; in the North, the pools are indoors. The average nightly rate is $75, lower on weekends. Amerisuites reservations: (800) 833-1516.
Summerfield Suites, with headquarters in Wichita, Kan., owns 24 properties, a number of them in California. According to Tina W. Gunderson, a spokeswoman, all have pools and fitness centers; a free buffet breakfast is provided and from Monday to Thursday, a social hour.
The bedroom has a door that shuts, and the kitchen includes a stovetop. Suites with two bedrooms are also available. The typical stay is five nights, with an average weeknight rate for one bedroom of $89 to $119; two bedrooms, $99 to $149. On the weekend, a one-bedroom suite averages $79, Ms. Gunderson said. Summerfield Suites reservations: (800) 833-4353.
Residence Inns, a pioneer in the field, is now owned by Marriott, which generally franchises the properties. There are 205 across the country, according to Geary Campbell, a spokeswoman. All have exercise rooms, and all but two have outdoor pools. The bedrooms have doors that shut, and the newer places have sleep sofas. The kitchen includes a full stove.
The average stay is five days, Ms. Campbell said. The weeknight rate averages $75 to $110, and weekends, $59 to $89. Residence Inns reservations: (800) 331-3131.

 
 
Question of Demand
 Mark Lomano, executive vice president of Smith Travel Research, says he is not persuaded there is enough business-travel demand to absorb the prospective fivefold growth in the number of suite hotels. If this is the case, he said in an interview, a hybrid will develop, marketed to both business travelers -- especially relocating workers, a particular target of this hotel segment -- and vacationing families.
If he is right, suite hotels will increasingly become havens for vacationers, particularly what the travel industry calls the V.F.R.'s -- people Visiting Friends and Relatives. For those who have lined up outside a brother-in-law's bathroom, this is good news.

HEADLINE: Songs to Make People Laugh, and to Think

BYLINE: By JACKIE FITZPATRICK 

 BODY:
LES JULIAN stood there for just a minute and stared out at the 300 children sitting in the gym at the Stanley T. Williams School in Northford and they stared back waiting to see what this tall, bearded guy in the brightly colored flower shirt and tie was going to do. And then he started to sing. 
 Of all the kids in Ms. Doo-a-Lottes class
I colored the best by far.
I always stayed between the lines.
I always got a star.
But I was getting kinda bored
And Ms. Doo-a-Lotte must have known
Cause she gave us a page with a couple of lines
Sayin,' 'Class you're on your own.
Grab your crayons and let's color, color outside the lines.
You never know what we'll discover or what new worlds we'll find.
Imagination will unwind when we color outside the lines.'
. . . Green horses jumping over stars, wheels on people, feet on cars.
Dancing houses wearing skirts, gorillas riding geyser squirts.
Butterflies and bumblebees need room to dance --
More paper please!
His audience laughed, giggled, chuckled and smiled, and then their shoulders started to move and shimmy, their toes tapped. They wriggled and clapped. Their heads bobbed.
"It was like magic, really, the minute the music started, they were moving," said the principal, Robin Blaschke. "Our P.T.O. tries to find really high quality programming for our students and this was one of the best we've ever had."
Mr. Julian encouraged the kindergarten through second grade crowd to sing and they did. He gathered several of them to play percussion instruments. Then he asked three teachers to sing a background chorus on one song and a gym teacher, Ray Torpey, took it a step further, starting a Rockette-like kick line that caused the whole place to erupt in laughter.
"When the teachers danced, that was the best part," said Jackie Pireaux, 7. "It was so funny."
"And he kept encouraging us to use our imagination," said Jamie Mikolinski, 8. "He said you can do anything with your imagination and he's right."
Mr. Julian sang many of his original songs, written either solo or with partners, songs like "Chocolate Is My Favorite Vegetable," which was a hit among members of the audience who had loud yucks and eeeough's when he mentioned "brussels sprouts" but loved the idea of chocolate as a vegetable.
The songs come from "Color Outside the Lines," a collection of Mr. Julian's children's songs that he recorded in the studio in his New Haven home and released on his own label, "Jump Right Over the MooON Records.
Some of the songs are wacky, some offer subtle messages, like "Donkey in the Ditch," the tale of a donkey who is picked on by all kinds of animals because he's stuck in a ditch. Later, after the donkey gets out, he comes upon a sheep stuck in a fence and has to decide to help him or hurt him.
Mr. Julian leaves the ending open on purpose "to give kids something to think about, to put the question out there." "Do you hurt back or do you help?" he asked. "I'd like a kid who might feel backed in a corner to consider using his imagination to get out of the situation, to think of ways to resolve problems without violence."
One student, Casey Galligan, 8, thought it was a "sad and sweet song."
His songs are made up of many different kinds of music -- folk, jazz, blues, scat, Middle Eastern, Brazilian -- all sounds Mr. Julian himself likes and plays. "Color Outside the Lines" recently won two awards, the Parents Choice 1995 Award and the American Library Association's Best Children's Recordings of 1995.
Mr. Julian -- who performs at schools, festivals, hospitals and nursing homes all over the state -- is now getting calls from around the country. (His telephone number is 389-5862; people can write to him at Post Office Box 3488, New Haven 06515.) He's written a study guide for schools to accompany his "Color Outside the Lines" performance and he also often conducts workshops for teachers and has run song-writing classes for students.
He smiles widely whenever he's singing to children and he said he always enjoys it, particularly when he knows he has connected to his young audience. That is, of course, the point. Letters from students and principals at schools across the state make it known that his rapport with them was warm and instantaneous.
The funny thing is, though, just a decade ago he would never have figured himself a children's performer. When he first started performing, as a folk-blues singer in the early 1970's when a student at Quinnipiac College, for the first two years he had to sing with his eyes closed.
"For the longest time I just couldn't open my eyes or make eye contact with the audience," he said. "But when you're working the bars, sometimes that's not such a good thing; you can't see the tomato someone's about to throw."
Although he graduated with a degree in economics, Mr. Julian found it "like soap powder in the mouth, that dry" so he kept with his music by night, working by day in crisis intervention at a psychiatric clinic at Griffin Hospital. He couldn't make music his full-time occupation then, "it wasn't working; it was starving."
So he stayed at the clinic for nine years and quickly learned "about the healing powers of music." He played for his patients and he started to realize that there was a larger audience beyond the people he was playing to at the clubs.
Always, he said, there had been childlike qualities to some of his music and he started to think about performing for children after his nieces and nephews were born. He and his wife, Noreen Julian, a school psychologist do not have children, but they spend a great deal of time with their nieces and nephews. He says her work and her insight helped him as he started writing children's songs.
"How can you not be affected by children? You are an uncle and then suddenly this little girl is 2 years old and you say, 'Wow, look at everything she's doing, that kind of thing,' he said. One of his songs is appropriately titled "Baby Stuck in the Terrible Two's."
By the mid-1980's, his club work was doing so well he left his psychiatric clinic job and after a long time of not being able to define himself as a musician, he finally could. He started writing more children's music and defining his act, taking his show to schools, eventually giving up the clubs all together.
He calls his children's shows, "a work in progress." But Sara Querfeld, a language arts specialist at the Stanley T. Williams School, said everything that Mr. Julian did was applicable to what her students were learning. "The one song he sang about planting a garden was perfect because we have a learning garden right here at our school," she said. "The songs were so wonderful and so appropriate."
In addition to singing for the young set, he has also developed a show of cabaret and Broadway tunes for people at nursing homes, hospitals and hospices.
"I've done a lot of work at the hospice in Branford, singing at people's bedsides and it is so powerful," he said. "If you ever want to get your life back into perspective, spend some time there."
His hope is that his tape will take off to such an extent that a big record label will take note and sign him on. The music business being as competitive as it is, he was compelled to start his own label and promote his work himself.
Now, he said, he makes a pretty good living at what he does, which also happens to be something that he loves. He is currently writing songs for another children's recording and also plans to release a recording of instrumental music and one for older listeners. "How many people do you know who are really doing what they love to do?" he asked. "Everyone should try to reach that crossroads where you are doing what you love and where it makes the greatest contribution."
"Kids often tell me they get a lot from my performances," he said. "But I take so much from them."

HEADLINE: What Makes Jesse Run?

BYLINE: By Alan Brinkley; Alan Brinkley, a professor of American history at Columbia University, is the author of "The End of Reform: New Deal Liberalism in Recession and War."

 BODY:

JESSE
The Life and Pilgrimage of Jesse Jackson.
By Marshall Frady.
Illustrated. 552 pp. New York:
Random House. $28.50.
To his many detractors (almost all of them white), Jesse Jackson is a man of insatiable ego and enormous appetites for power and fame -- a purely political being, at times a dangerous demagogue. To his millions of admirers (who include not only the overwhelming majority of African-Americans but also countless people of all races around the world), he is one of the great moral leaders of our time, the true successor to Martin Luther King Jr., an American Gandhi. One of the many virtues of "Jesse," Marshall Frady's powerful (if occasionally somewhat overheated) biography, is the way it reconciles these two images of the man and makes clear that both are in some measure correct. 
 Mr. Frady is a talented reporter who has made something of a career for himself writing books about the contemporary South, including biographies of George Wallace and Billy Graham. This study shares both the intelligence and the florid, vaguely Faulknerian prose style of his earlier works. But it is more intense and more personal than they were, in part because Mr. Frady had extensive and intimate access to Mr. Jackson over many years and in part because he obviously admires and likes his subject. Perhaps for that reason, he has managed to reveal something of the inner character of this complicated man and to make clear both how familiar and how unusual a type he is.
American history is richly peopled with political figures who have risen from modest backgrounds to the highest levels of public life through ceaseless striving and unbounded ambition. In one sense, Mr. Jackson joins a long line of such leaders, a line that in this century has included Huey Long, Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton. Like them, he has spent his life on a perpetual quest for recognition and respect, struggling to "be somebody." Like them, he is often shameless in his search for publicity, courting the news media with an insistence unusual even in politics. And like them, he seems to be perpetually in motion, only fully alive in a public setting, restless and uncomfortable when outside the limelight.
Even though he has a comfortable home, a durable marriage and devoted children, he is not truly a part of any private life into which he could comfortably retreat if his public career were to go awry. "They all go back home sooner or later," he once said of conventional politicians. "That's the difference between me and them. I have no home to go back to." The public world, he explained, "is my home." But in other senses Mr. Jackson is quite different from other contemporary political figures. That difference is most evident in the unusual starkness of his origins and the distinctive way he rose above them.
He was born in Greenville, S.C., to an unwed teen-age mother and an imperious married father -- who for a time lived next door to Mr. Jackson with his legitimate family and barely acknowledged his furtively conceived son. During much of his youth, he was even separated from his own mother, who left him with his grandmother while she began another family. Eventually, her new husband, a loyal, hard-working man, adopted Jesse (and gave him his name). But Mr. Jackson has spent much of his life, according to Mr. Frady and many others, searching for the recognition and respect his real father denied him, and struggling to escape the sense of rootlessness and despair that enveloped much of the community in which he grew up.
A diligent student and notable high school athlete, Mr. Jackson won a football scholarship to the University of Illinois. (Greenville's own Furman University -- the alma mater, ironically, of Marshall Frady -- was still rigidly segregated and would not have him.) But Mr. Jackson felt isolated and out of place at Illinois and after a year transferred to North Carolina A & T, a black college in Greensboro. Once again he became an athletic star, and also a campus leader. He was slow to join the civil rights ferment of the 1960's, which students at his college had helped begin with their famous 1960 sit-in at a local Woolworth's. But once he allowed himself to be drawn into it, he developed a thirst for the movement that nothing could slake.
First in North Carolina and then in Chicago, where he attended divinity school for several years, Mr. Jackson not only joined the movement but immediately thrust himself into the center of it, with an almost obsessive determination to dominate and to lead. He soon attracted the attention of an impressed (if always slightly skeptical) Martin Luther King Jr., who recognized Mr. Jackson as a young man of extraordinary gifts and equally extraordinary ambition and who drew him into the inner circle of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.
But after the trauma of King's death, which Mr. Jackson witnessed from a few yards away, relations between Mr. Jackson and the S.C.L.C. rapidly deteriorated. Mr. Jackson moved on to run his own, exceptionally aggressive community organizing effort in Chicago -- known first as Operation Breadbasket and then, after the final break with S.C.L.C., Operation PUSH. From that platform, he gradually began to gain national, and even international, attention -- particularly with the exhortatory lectures he delivered around the nation to minority students, urging them to take responsibility for their own lives. Long before Ronald Reagan and the right began to do so, Mr. Jackson was preaching a message of family values and social conservatism to his own embattled constituency.
Mr. Jackson's long, dramatic, wholly unconventional and unexpectedly successful campaign for the Presidency, which spanned the 1984 and 1988 elections, was at first an extension of his efforts to lead what was left of the movements of the 1960's. His candidacy, he argued, would draw attention again to the problems of race and poverty in America and force the established powers to address them. But as the response to his candidacy grew and grew, exceeding even his own expansive expectations, he began to consider himself -- and began to be considered by others -- a bona fide aspirant to the Presidency and, at times equally important to him, a viable candidate for Vice President.
It is an article of faith to Mr. Jackson, and to many of his admirers, that the only reason he fell short of those goals in the end was that he is black. To a degree, at least, he is certainly right. He has indeed been judged by standards different from those applied to other politicians. Conservative political leaders can pander to Pat Robertson and similar figures on the right whose anti-Semitism and bigotry is barely concealed and pay a relatively small political price. Mr. Jackson enjoys much less latitude where his own errors and accommodations are concerned. He is photographed in an awkward, and unsought, embrace with Yassir Arafat, makes a thoughtless reference to New York as "Hymietown," refuses to repudiate Louis Farrakhan (even while denouncing Mr. Farrakhan's anti-Semitism) and emerges with his reputation seriously and permanently damaged, a man forever beyond the pale of conventional political forgiveness.
But in attributing his failure to win acceptance into mainstream Democratic politics to racism alone, Mr. Jackson is actually underestimating himself and his relationship to conventional political life. This, at least, is the principal message of Mr. Frady's sympathetic, and ultimately persuasive, analysis of Mr. Jackson's career. Because unlike the many other upwardly mobile politicians whose excesses Mr. Jackson so often, and so unattractively, shares, his own career has been strikingly consistent in its commitment to a few broad principles -- and in its coupling of politics to a pointed moral message. Mr. Frady calls him a populist, but that is in fact an inadequate description of a figure whose invocation of the wisdom of the people -- and his conspicuous identification with the plight of what he calls "the least of us" -- is not the whole meaning of his public life.
Mr. Jackson is, in the end, less a populist politician than a moral evangelist. He is convinced that there is sympathy and goodness somewhere within even the most hardened soul, and he believes it is his job to reach down and unleash it. That helps account for what many call his naive effort to find accommodation with such unpopular figures as Mr. Arafat, Hafez al-Assad, Saddam Hussein and even Louis Farrakhan. It also explains the remarkable empathy he is able to display toward poor, desperate people all over the world -- and the response he evokes from them with his plea that they "keep hope alive" in what must often seem hopeless surroundings.
Mr. Jackson is certainly not averse to tactical maneuvers, as his sometimes brilliant, sometimes eccentric Presidential campaigns made clear. But it is the overall consistency of his public life, the absence of a conventionally pragmatic approach to politics, the aversion to compromise on basic principles, that most decisively separates Mr. Jackson from most other public figures of his time. In a sense, Mr. Frady argues, Mr. Jackson's movement into partisan politics in the 1980's -- as he himself seems at times fitfully to sense -- was an aberration (even if perhaps a permanent one) from the trajectory of his earlier adult life, an aberration that could only bring disappointment.
It is not simply, perhaps not even mainly, because Mr. Jackson is an African-American that his Presidential candidacies were somewhat quixotic in the end. The broad enthusiasm for Colin Powell suggests that it may well be possible now for a black man to be elected President. Mr. Jackson has been marginalized by conventional politics because he identifies so conspicuously with the black community, because he keeps the plight of the inner-city underclass so central to his message, and perhaps most of all because he does not play the game by the conventional rules.
American politics rewards pragmatism and compromise, not moral witness. And Jesse Jackson, perhaps the most gifted orator and magnetic public figure of our time, now moves uneasily between a political world in which he has never found a wholly secure place and a broader public culture that is, for the moment at least, largely without the passion for social justice that Mr. Jackson -- out of both soaring ambition and deep conviction -- strives so mightily to tap.

THE WEIGHT OF THE YEN
How Denial Imperils America's Future and Ruins an Alliance.
By R. Taggart Murphy.
352 pp. New York:
W. W. Norton & Company. $25.
One day in 1985, when I was living in Tokyo and running the Asian investment banking operations of Shearson Lehman Brothers, I was visited by James D. Robinson 3d, the chairman of American Express, our high-flying parent company. Mr. Robinson asked us to figure out how high up in the rankings of Japanese corporations -- as measured by size -- Amex could get if we had a virtually limitless budget and bought whatever financial companies could conceivably be for sale. Three months later, after feverish research on our part, Mr. Robinson returned for the answer. Making wildly optimistic assumptions, I said, we could be the 47th largest financial company in Japan. My boss was not happy. 
 Those were the days when the value of the land in Tokyo and its three surrounding prefectures was estimated to exceed the value of all the property of the United States. The Industrial Bank of Japan -- the country's classiest bank -- was valued at 18 times that of J. P. Morgan, its closest American counterpart. Japan was becoming the largest lender to the world, and its stock market value was approaching 40 percent of the combined value of all stock markets around the world.
Today, of course, the landscape looks a lot different. The Japanese economy has been on the ropes for most of the 1990's. The banking system is in shambles, mired in bad loans and scandals and requiring a bailout on the order of $400 billion. Many of Japan's trophy investments, like the purchase of Rockefeller Center, have turned sour. The once-revered civil service mandarins who directed Japan's amazing rise to power are demoralized and in disarray. Not long ago, the riot police were seen in the halls of Japan's Ministry of Finance protecting employees from an angry public.
This riches-to-rags story is the subject of "The Weight of the Yen," by R. Taggart Murphy, an investment banker living in Japan. He starts with a description of the unique features of the Japanese political and economic system that created such enormous surpluses of money for Japan to lend or invest abroad. Mr. Murphy reports, as one example, how the Government discouraged consumer purchases at home with high prices and strangling regulations. At the same time, it pushed companies to make up for lack of Japanese demand by exploiting markets overseas. The combination resulted in anemic levels of imports, enormous amounts of exports and mountains of cash to lend to other countries.
The most interesting part of the story, however, is why the Japanese economy tanked. Mr. Murphy's central point is that Tokyo's civil service drove the country into crisis out of an unwillingness to recognize that the Government's ability to control the economy was no longer feasible in a world where Japan's international trade and financial links had grown so extensive. When Japan's economy began to sag, Mr. Murphy says, the bureaucrats propped up the stock market by ordering Japanese companies to increase purchases of shares. Such purchases were made easier because the Bank of Japan -- Tokyo's Federal Reserve -- flooded the economy with low-cost money. Then the Government allowed banks to cook their books to avoid huge write-offs on old debts gone bad. It all worked for a while, but, under the glare of international scrutiny, especially from nervous investors around the globe, the house of cards collapsed. A far better course, Mr. Murphy implies, would have been to change Japanese economic fundamentals by, for example, deregulating the economy and releasing consumer demand, and by disclosing the banking crisis earlier and addressing it before the pressures became so severe.
Mr. Murphy's single biggest culprit in this sad story is Japan's civil service, particularly the Ministry of Finance. He explains how this unbelievably powerful department -- combining as it does the functions of our Treasury Department, Securities and Exchange Commission and Office of Management and Budget, and often having a
de facto veto over even the prime minister's decisions -- arrogantly misused its clout. The author is quite emotional on the subject, with descriptions of "rampaging bureaucrats" and analogies between the Ministry of Finance and the uncontrollable Japanese military of the 1930's. One of his policy prescriptions is a dismantling of the ministry itself, a highly prescient recommendation given that serious high-level debate on this very course of action has begun in Tokyo in recent months.
For the most part, "The Weight of the Yen" is a fast-paced account of an important part of the late 20th century. While its cursory advice for everything that ails Japan and America, thrown in at the end, detracts from the story, the book does provoke the question "What happens now?"
Mr. Murphy implies that current problems notwithstanding, Japan is still a powerhouse. In this he is dead right. These islands still account for two-thirds of East Asia's economic activity. Economic growth is stirring again. Companies like Toyota and Fujitsu are strategically investing outside of Japan, particularly in the highly dynamic emerging markets from Seoul to Jakarta. And a new prime minister has recently been put at the helm, one whose vast experience and powerful personality could well provide the leadership for Tokyo to turn the corner fast.
The challenges to America are every bit as daunting as they were in the 1980's, and they will continue to center on finance and commerce. Japan will still be a major lender to us and to the world. Confrontations over trade are sure to continue into the next century, about everything from intellectual property rights to aircraft landing rights. But compared with the last decade, Japan will be more preoccupied with its own internal affairs than with Japan-United States relations. It will focus on modernizing its political system, on deregulating its economy and on defining its interests without its traditional deference to American views. It will loom very large in our foreign policy because of its global importance, but also because of its lack of responsiveness to American goals. On several occasions, Mr. Murphy bemoans the way Tokyo and Washington mishandled their alliance these past 10 years. His account is likely to be a prologue to the even greater turbulence in the Washington-Tokyo alliance in the years ahead.

HANDS OFF
Why the Government Is a Menace to Economic Health.
By Susan Lee.
253 pp. New York:
Simon & Schuster. $23.
 Susan Lee calls herself a "mild libertarian" but it is hard to find much that is mild in "Hands Off." She just barely stops short of arguing that any and every government action designed to alter the unfettered workings of a free-market system inevitably makes things worse. Both an economist, with Ph.D. credentials, and a journalist, a former member of the editorial board of The Wall Street Journal and a former deputy editor of The New York Times Op-Ed page, Ms. Lee is a generally clear, and always spirited, writer. Her lively examples and her analysis of what she perceives to be the failed economic theories of the past 35 years may well make "Hands Off" a valuable source book for today's conservative Republican politicians as they seek election for themselves and others of like mind. 
 Ms. Lee is not herself a partisan in the party sense, however. She praises President Carter for the steps he took toward easing regulation of transportation, communications and financial markets. And she reserves her harshest criticism for President Bush, who talked no-new-taxes and deregulation and smaller budget deficits, but largely presided over the opposite. In other ways, however, her tack is less evenhanded.
 Ms. Lee uses the 10 percent "luxury tax" of the early 1990's as a good example of the harm that can be done by government intervention in specific sectors of the economy. Instead of raising the hoped for revenues, it produced a buyers' strike that caused unemployment and business bankruptcies, especially among yacht builders. But while attacking targeted tax increases like these, she virtually ignores tax breaks for favored industries and even single companies, which are far more prevalent. Ms. Lee mixes her discussion of relatively narrow interventions (including health and safety regulations, which she tersely acknowledges have "offsetting benefits") with analysis of the more broadly aimed efforts of recent administrations and the Federal Reserve System to speed growth and reduce unemployment -- or the reverse, to rein in growth and control inflation. In each case, her judgment is unqualified: "An activist government does not work."
 Ms. Lee devotes much of the book to explaining why she thinks that statement is true by critically examining the various economic theories -- supply-side, monetarism and so on -- that had influence in Washington since the mid-1970's and, at times, seemed to have the theories of John Maynard Keynes on the run. But her main target is Keynes. She is unequivocal: "Keynesian theories are just plain wrong," she says, dismissing any of their seeming successes as having been caused by other, natural factors. It was, for example, expanding trade with other booming economies and the increasing application of technology during the Kennedy and Johnson Administrations, not the stimulus of their tax cuts, that caused the long boom of the 1960's.
 In the end, Ms. Lee associates herself with the views of a relatively new group of economic theorists whose guiding principal of "rational expectations" she describes as "a better idea." Exactly what they believe is never clearly explained by Ms. Lee (nor, it should be noted, by the theory's originators, either). Their bottom line is that government efforts to alter the course of the economy in the short run are bound to fail, though long-term efforts, such as improving education, may be O.K. To this, Ms. Lee adds her own view that insuring the best possible economic performance also requires low taxes, low government spending, less regulation, free trade and a steady but slow increase in the money supply.
 What "Hands Off" never gets to, and it is a serious omission, are the theories of modern economists who have modified Keynes's prescriptions somewhat but who still believe that free markets will, from time to time, develop afflictions that can be cured by governmental action. The economists who run the Federal Reserve today plainly agree with this (whether they are right or wrong in thinking the economy needs a hand on the anti-inflation reins right now), and economists of a Keynesian persuasion hold high positions in the Clinton Administration. But to read an explanation of why they have arrived at their views will require some other book. For those who are interested, "Peddling Prosperity," by Paul Krugman, another felicitous writer, would be a good choice.

HEADLINE: The View From: Milford;
Old Station Is Reborn as an Arts Hub

BYLINE: By LIZ BARZDA 

 BODY:
THE railroad station in Milford has found new life. The handsomely restored 1881 station (formerly a lamp factory as well as an art gallery) near the green is the home of the Milford Fine Arts Center. Now an arts hub, the building has been included in the Register of Historic Places by the state.
Since the 70's, Milford's cultural groups had been searching banks, churches and government buildings for display and performance space. After years of bureaucratic frustration, fund-raising events and a campaign, art and craft shows, recitals, workshops and dance performances are finally taking place in the 114-year old building. 
 The center with its 900 members was described as "the most active arts center in Connecticut" by its executive director, William Meddick, who is an artist. He said that support from the Connecticut Commission on the Arts and the National Endowment stayed within the center to produce programs in house, rather than parceling the money out to various organizations.
Since 1988, the council has been housed in a tiny one-room office of the Victorian-style Taylor building on the green. Files and papers were stacked nearly to the ceiling in the cubicle. "We have long sought larger quarters," said Mr. Meddick.
"The eastbound railroad station was the only vacant city building in Milford available to a nonprofit organization," he continued. "The site, owned by the state of Connecticut, has been subleased by the local transit district to the center for $1 a year since 1990."
A stipulation of the contract was that the lobby and bathrooms continue to be open to commuters when the center is operational; it is a Metro-North Commuter Railroad station as well as being used by Amtrak.
Using the railroad station was only a thought tossed around at many council meetings; years of planning and painstaking growth preceded the reality.
The center's president, Mim Mills, who is also an artist, said that "when the economy soured, the council would have an event, raise money and then spend it for a designated project." "This growth process seemed to take forever."
As part of their commitment to the restoration, the council pledged to raise $150,000. A third of the pledge was realized from the 1990 "Buy a Brick Campaign"; blue flagstone plaques were sold for $50 or $100, with the donor's name inscribed, to be placed in the center's courtyard.
The rest of the money was contributed by the city of Milford, businesses and individuals, Ms. Mills said.
John and Barbara Streicker of Manhattan, who have been summer residents of Milford for many years, donated $20,000 to the building fund because they said they wanted to give something back to the community.
Mr. Meddick said a questionnaire was sent to 28,000 families in Milford, asking them "what they wanted from their Arts Council and from the Arts Center."
He said they asked for more performing arts, more music and more activities for children.
"The questionnaire was a way of educating the community of our existence," Ms. Mills said. "It publicized our commitment to bring art to the community -- our membership shot up to 800."
The center was on its way when it succeeded in raising $160,000, which was added to $640,000 awarded in 1994 under a National Transportation Grant meant for "improving structures and facilities" near mass transit.
"We did this by reactivating the 'Buy a Brick Campaign' and soliciting from corporations, businesses and individuals," Mr. Meddick said.
As supporters started sending money in, securing the building began. Work started on the roof to stop the leaks, rotted eaves were replaced and the outside of the building was "depigeoned." Excavation of the cellar followed, concrete was poured, main floor beams and floors were redone.
"Money for the center's interior work went for seating, stage lighting, sound equipment and general furnishings," Mr. Meddick said. "The second floor over the gallery area was removed. Exposed beams were refinished." He said that his office overlooks the gallery and a conference room is next to his office.
The main hall has a gallery for art as well as a 135-seat theater; there is also a balcony for lights and sound equipment.
The basement contains a kitchen for catered events, workshops where artists will give demonstrations, and space for after-school projects for children.
The courtyard next to the building, which has an elevator and a ramp entry, now includes space for benches and landscaping.
Roads and sidewalks from River and Broad Streets leading up to the railroad station were resurfaced. Lampposts, iron fencing and flowers were installed.
"The National Endowment for the Arts and the Connecticut Commission on the Arts have given us a lot of guidance and direction in terms of developing the railroad station into a home for the center," Ms. Mills said. "They taught us how to do our cultural assessment; consequently, we were then in touch with the community and their needs. And they gave us money to carry it out."
The Connecticut Commission on the Arts taught the council how to do long-range planning, in addition to contributing $5,000 to $6,000 yearly for operational support. And the city of Milford has increased its support each year with outright operational grants. Next year it will be up to $40,000. "We also learned how to raise money," acknowledged Mr. Meddick.
As the railroad station's $800,000 restoration neared completion, a gala opening reception was held last fall for 400 guests.
"Now that we have the building, we need money to equip it and to run all the planned programs. Revenue has been realized from several concerts, art and photography shows, and an art auction," said a volunteer, Kay Barrett, of Madison.
A retrospective of the work of Roger Van Damme, a local artist, was held recently in the new gallery; national juried art shows and craft exhibitions are planned. Future entertainment ideas include old movies being shown on Friday nights, a monthly coffeehouse cabaret with music, jazz nights and recitals for children and adults.
"The Eastbound Theater took off, once the building opened," said Mr. Meddick. The community theater group's three productions so far have been sold out. The fourth one, "The Four Poster," rounds out the season on June 21-29. The council has also received requests for children's shows, he added.
Ms. Mills says the center plans "to first fill our own needs, scheduling activities, then rent the building for meetings and receptions because we're nonprofit."
The Milford Hospital rented the building in December for a Christmas decoration fund-raising event. A show open to all Connecticut artists is scheduled for July.
Ms. Mills also points out that the station art complex "is central to downtown and is part of the revitalization plan for Milford center. It will add activities to the city in conjunction with Milford's harbor renovation project, which will attract tourism." She says that the city will benefit financially.
With 200 volunteers pitching in, the center has come alive with visual and performing arts. As one volunteer, Harriet Racz said, "The Milford Fine Arts Center has brought culture into the community."

HEADLINE: TELEVISION;
A Perilous Journey in a Prime-Time Sea

BYLINE: By BETSY SHARKEY 

 BODY:
IT WAS, BY ANY DEFINITION, AN unusual concoction. At its heart were a couple named Noah and Jesse Beckett and their unlikely menagerie of children and animals. A scene that looked as if it had been plucked from "Lassie," with kids trailing animals through verdant fields, might dissolve into a moment of "Thirtysomething" angst, with Noah weeping in front of his computer as Wagner played in the background.
The series, on Monday evenings at 8, was almost unsettling in its egalitarian construction. The eight children, who ranged in age from 2 to 17, were all adopted. Two were Hispanic, one was black; all had been either abandoned or abused, as had the family's 37 animals. Jesse (Betsy Brantley) was a veterinarian at a wildlife park in Tampa, Fla. Noah (Daniel Hugh Kelly) was a coach turned best-selling author. Nevertheless, the family was in many ways traditional -- they laughed, they fought, they loved. And when the hourlong drama was slipped into ABC's schedule in February, it reinforced values like honesty, loyalty and responsibility. 
 ABC scheduled "Second Noah" in a time slot once known as the family hour. But now, for various reasons having to do with production costs and changing life styles, "the family hour" is almost devoid of network dramas aimed at both parents and children. Would "Second Noah," with its modest but slightly improving ratings, be granted a second season? As the May date for a decision approached, the question of the show's survival seemed to be a question about the survival of an entire kind of prime-time programming.
"This is the only drama about a contemporary family, an intact family, that was developed and picked up by a network in the last three years," Pam Long, the executive producer of "Second Noah," said in April. "People in Hollywood are watching very closely. A lot of them have family-oriented shows that they're sitting on. If 'Second Noah' goes down, they're going to put those ideas in a drawer and lock them away, and it's going to be years before we get another shot at a show about a family."
Less than 24 hours before the network announced its fall schedule on May 20, the producers of "Second Noah" learned that ABC had renewed the series for the fall.
Family dramas like "The Waltons" and "Little House on the Prairie" were once sprinkled liberally across the network landscape, but they have largely disappeared despite a loud protest by politicians, educators, religious leaders and parents. Given the success of adult-oriented sitcoms and the loss of much of a young audience to cable giants like Nickelodeon, justifying a place for family dramas in prime time has become a difficult task.
"If you study the numbers hard, the amount of time the family is watching television together is less and less these days," said Ted Harbert, president of ABC Entertainment. "However, that doesn't mean we should give up."
The fact that "Second Noah" made it into prime time and is, for the time being, staying there won't result in a flood of family dramas, but many people in Hollywood believe that the show has at least opened the door to a few more. In the fall, WB will introduce a family drama, "Seventh Heaven," which it describes as " 'Eight Is Enough' with a minister dad," on Sunday nights at 7.
Although "Second Noah" is remaining on the air, everyone involved realizes that it is hanging on by a thread. ABC has ordered only 13 new episodes, which means that the series has roughly half a season in which to prove itself. But the network is giving it some immediate help. On June 1, ABC began to show reruns of "Second Noah" at 8 P.M. on Saturdays, the time slot that will be its new home in the fall.
BRANDON TARTIKOFF, chairman of New World Entertainment, the company that produces "Second Noah," likens the show's journey to prime time to the biblical Noah's ordeal: "40 days and 40 nights." Actually, it took a lot longer.
In 1994, Mr. Tartikoff, who once oversaw hits like "Cheers" and "Hill Street Blues" as president of NBC Entertainment, was at a breakfast meeting with Jerry Katzman and John Mass of the William Morris agency. Anheuser-Busch, a new William Morris client, was interested in developing a television show that would be set at one of the company's 16 theme parks.
"I started rattling an idea around in my head," Mr. Tartikoff said. "What if there was a couple and one of the parents was a veterinarian and took care of the wildlife at one of these theme parks, and, like adding another layer to the cake, what if she and her husband took in all these children that nobody wanted?"
Eventually, Mr. Tartikoff had a premise brimming with ingredients. But the executive producer, Ms. Long, was at first reluctant to sign on.
"Brandon said, 'I want you to write a family show with kids and animals,' " recalled Ms. Long, who had been a supervising producer of the CBS dramatic series "Christy," about a teacher in the Old West. "I thought, 'Oh, great, the two things they always warn you about.' But my husband, Stephen Brackley, who's my favorite writer and also a producer on 'Second Noah,' said: 'What are you hesitating for? Our whole life is about kids and animals.' " The couple have two sons, 10 and 13, and four dogs, two of which the family rescued.
The creative demands involved in constructing and writing a show like "Second Noah" are sizable. It is no easy task to tell stories that will be compelling to diverse ethnic and economic groups across the country, and it's perhaps even harder to tell ones that will appeal to entire families.
"To create a show that will appeal to young children, 13-year-old boys and 18-year-old girls and not make their parents' eyeballs roll back in their heads because it's so mind-numbingly silly or simple is quite a plateful," Ms. Long said. "What I think is the right combination, and what I promised ABC I would do, is make them laugh a lot and cry at least once."
The Becketts may be a traditional family, in which love and a firm hand guide the children in a way that recalls "Leave It to Beaver." But its story lines are very much of the 1990's: Ricky, the oldest child, is a teen-age father who has kept his son; the 13-year-old twins, Danny and Ranny, use the Internet to search for their birth mother.
TO MS. LONG, THERE ARE basically 10 stories to tell. "It's the Ten Commandments," she said. "You break them and you've got a problem, and that's dramatic."
During the season, critics tended to overlook the show, but those who did discuss it had mixed opinions. John J. O'Connor, writing in The New York Times, said the pilot showed promise, but he predicted trouble down the line: "One can almost feel the poking fingers of network executives," he wrote. Ken Tucker, writing in Entertainment Weekly, characterized the show as " 'Daktari' for the kids of 'Thirtysomething' fans: As drama, 'Noah' is slowah."
The letters that families have sent to Mr. Harbert have a different sort of emphasis. "I got a letter from a 10-year-old girl who said, 'Thank you for putting on "Second Noah" because it's the first TV show my father has ever watched with me,' " said Mr. Harbert, who added that his office had been deluged with similar letters. "It gives you hope that if it can happen in her house, maybe it can spread."
"Second Noah" is patently emotional, and Ms. Long is unapologetic about that. She won't leave the editing room, she said, until she has been moved to laughter and tears by a particular episode. That the Beckett clan seems to be created with a nod to cultural diversity was not intentional, Ms. Long said. She based the characters on people she knew when she was growing up in Alabama; her motivation, she said, was to be neither politically correct nor commercial but to create a family that felt true to her.
In the spring of 1995, there was good news: ABC bought the pilot, which tested extremely well in audience research. Later in the year, however, there was bad news: the pilot would be broadcast on Feb. 5, 1996, at the start of the February sweeps, one of the high-competition periods during which advertising rates are determined.
And the competition on Monday night from 8 to 9 was stiff: "Melrose Place" on Fox; "Star Trek: Voyager" on UPN; "Fresh Prince of Bel Air" and "In the House" on NBC, and "The Nanny" and "Dave's World" on CBS. There were well-established shows in virtually every demographic group that "Second Noah" might appeal to.
So Mr. Tartikoff set out to find an audience for "Second Noah," mainly young parents and people across the political spectrum who had been vocal about family values. Mailings were sent to ministers, priests and rabbis. The cast spent hours chatting on the Internet. And Mr. Tartikoff, Ms. Brantley and Ms. Long spent hours on talk radio shows, fielding calls from listeners.
"I had an astonishing number of young mothers call in wanting to know if they could watch 'Second Noah' and put down the remote control," said Ms. Brantley, who has a 5-year-old daughter. "I know from hoping to be involved in my child's life that if I can watch something with her that I'm going to get something out of, that's the best of both worlds."
In March, "Second Noah" faced a pre-emption because of ABC's Academy Awards broadcast. "When we came back on, I knew I would be fighting for the show's life," Mr. Tartikoff said. "I came up with this scheme to take four of the episodes we'd already run and do a sort of marathon on the Disney Channel."
Geraldine Laybourne, who had been conducting research for the Disney Channel, which she oversees along with Disney's other cable interests, told Mr. Tartikoff, "You're a hit with female teen-agers." The "Second Noah" marathon ran on the Disney Channel, which is affiliated with ABC, on March 29.
The series ended the season getting a 13 percent share of the audience. Among teen-age girls, its share rose to 19 percent. Among children ages 2 to 11, it was the second-most-watched show in prime time; only "Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman" drew more.
"You can look at the ratings; they weren't fantastic, but they weren't terrible either," Mr. Harbert said. "It was doing better at the end than it did at the beginning, and that's the sign you look for."
LAST MONTH, AS ABC BEGAN TO decide which of its series it would renew, "Second Noah" was on the bubble. There were scores of new pilots in development that could be considered surer bets.
It is common practice for producers to give network executives a summary of why they believe their shows should be renewed. Mr. Tartikoff took that notion and created "Second Noah: A Second Season," essentially a book in a three-ring binder.
First, Mr. Tartikoff analyzed the ratings and offered a case study of two other family-oriented shows, CBS's "Touched by an Angel" and Fox's "Party of Five." Both started slow, but in their second seasons they increased the number of households they reached: "Party of Five" by 37 percent, "Touched by an Angel" by 49 percent.
Then he discussed plans to improve the show, by quickening the pace and following four plot threads in an episode instead of three. Mr. Tartikoff also analyzed where "Second Noah" might best fit into ABC's schedule and argued that "Second Noah" would do best on Saturday night at 8, where its main competition would be CBS's "Dr. Quinn: Medicine Woman," which has recently been attracting an older audience.
Finally, the recent Congressional pressure on the networks to provide more family programming, may have played in the program's favor.
On May 15, five days before ABC was to announce its fall schedule, Ms. Long and Mr. Tartikoff flew to New York for a final meeting with network executives. On May 19, Mr. Harbert called Mr. Tartikoff to tell him that "Second Noah" would be picked up for the fall.
"I'm not saying every show on television has to be 'Second Noah,' " Ms. Long said. "There should be at least one."

HEADLINE: Even the Love Stories Couldn't Save Cambodia's Cinema

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: PHNOM PENH, Cambodia

 BODY:
FILMING HAS SLOWED drastically on the set of the television mini-series "Full Moon Ghost." The producer has just acquired clip-on microphones from the United States, and the actors must now take time to memorize their lines.
"Everything used to be dubbed, and it didn't matter if the actors made mistakes," said the producer, Noy Rauv. "Now everybody is complaining that we are taking too long to film." 
 But the rest of the process is still quick. The series is being shot, like all Cambodian film, with little more than a VHS camcorder and a couple of reflector boards. Editing and post-production are minimal.
Today, a handful of television dramas like this one, along with occasional music videos, are virtually all that is left of the Cambodian movie industry, which over the past decade has experienced what is probably the fastest growth and quickest death of any in the world. From a high of 167 films produced in 1990, the number dropped to 110 in 1991, 66 in 1992, 35 in 1993 and 31 in 1994, according to The Phnom Penh Post. In 1989, 200 film companies were registered with the Government Cinema Department; last summer there were just 6. No theatrical films are being produced and marketed today, according to people in the film world.
During Cambodian film's brief moment at the beginning of this decade, 50 movie houses were each packing in up to 800 people a day in the capital city alone. But too many of the films had similar love-story plots. Then along came video pirates, an influx of films from other Asian countries and a proliferation of television sets. In May 1993, when the Phnom Penh Cinema screened "Black Lady," the last Cambodian-made film to be shown in the city, only 20 people came to see it.
The tragicomic saga is one of artistic and entrepreneurial energy brought low and of the difficulty of rebuilding a culture in a country whose arts, economy and legal system were devastated by four years of mass killings by the Communist Khmer Rouge.
During the 1960's and early 70's, Cambodian cinema was known primarily for the vanity productions of King Norodom Sihanouk -- who starred along with his relatives, retainers and invited diplomats. But by 1975, Cambodian film making had been annihilated by the mad agrarian reformers of the Khmer Rouge.
From 1975 to 1979, that radical Maoist regime caused the deaths of more than a million people, targeting in particular the educated classes and killing off 90 percent of the country's artists, actors, musicians, dancers and teachers.
Starting in 1979, and for the first years of freedom, people starved for entertainment gathered under the stars for all-night productions of local dramas called "lakhon bassac," their children sleeping beside them on mats.
Then the video camera arrived.
Around 1988, well-to-do refugees began returning for visits from the United States and leaving VHS camcorders behind with their relatives. Enterprising amateurs went wild, turning out hundreds of nearly identical movies, and small movie theaters in which patrons sat on rows of benches opened all over the country.
The film makers, inventing scripts as they went along, worked as fast as the cameras could roll, on budgets of $2,000 or $3,000 and on schedules measured in weeks.
"It was like community-access programming run amok," said John Eli Shapiro, a Los Angeles-based screenwriter who has written about Cambodian film making for American trade journals.
NO MORE THAN 16 people would provide all the voices, dubbing two or three characters per story. Mae Moen, one of the busiest performers, claimed to have been in 80 productions in two years, her voice changing from video to video. Such well-known names had more work than they could handle, and they quickly became stars.
"They would contract with about 10 productions at the same time, and then they would choose which one they would go to," said Phin Chanda, one of the industry's failed entrepreneurs, who made only one film. "So my film took one year to finish because the stars were not available."
Mrs. Phin emerged from the ordeal chastened. "It is not so easy to make money," she said.
Her experience was typical. When she began, the movie business looked like fast money. But by the time her film was done, audiences had lost interest, and video pirates were undercutting the market.
"Even my poor film was stolen," Mrs. Phin said.
Meanwhile, audiences had grown tired of seeing the same story over and over. (Political films, like Ivon Hem's 1989 movie about Pol Pot, leader of the Khmer Rouge, were an anomaly; what audiences craved were romances.)
"There was only one subject: love, love, love," said Dy Soknath, deputy director of TVK, a Government-run television station. "They fall in love with each other, they walk across the garden, and then they suffer. That was the only subject of Cambodian films."
Mrs. Phin agreed. Her film, "Oh! The Legacy of Love!," was exactly like all the others. By the time she was ready to distribute it, at the end of 1990, television sets were spreading, bringing large audiences in homes and cafes. Even in villages without electricity, people were watching small battery-powered black-and-white sets. And films from Thailand, Hong Kong and Taiwan had captured the national fancy.
The collapse of the Cambodian film industry was rapid. Most actors, directors and crews returned to their lives as teachers, waitresses, clerks and government workers. But some struggled on. The most popular personalities now tour on stage in the United States, France and Australia, where Cambodians refugees have become more affluent than the relatives they left behind and have more money to spend on entertainment.
These actors and actresses can also be spotted today in parks in Phnom Penh, pantomiming to the sounds of cassette players and making music videos that are sold here and in Cambodian neighborhoods abroad. The cost for the one-day shoot might be $20 each for an actor, actress and camera operator, plus lunch and transportation.
With copyright laws weak and mostly ignored, Mrs. Phin said, the music videos often pirate popular songs without compunction. But the weakness of those laws also means that the video makers themselves soon lose control of their product.
So far, American films have found little place in the Cambodian television market, which remains entranced by productions from neighboring Asian countries. Him Suong, a department director at TVK, said that his station had screened only occasional American films -- James Bond, Rambo, a vampire movie -- and that they were viewed as curiosities. "People like them because they are something unusual," he said.
Asked to name the most popular American actor in Cambodia, he apologized, saying he could not remember any names.
"Schwarzenegger?" he was asked.
"Schwarzenegger?" he replied.

Landlord's Appeal On Rent
 
Q In 1992 the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal ruled that my landlord was charging me more than the legal rent for my rent-stabilized apartment. It ordered the landlord to pay compensatory and punitive damages, but the landlord appealed that ruling by filing a petition for administrative review. Now, nearly four years later, D.H.C.R. has yet to rule on the appeal and says the matter is still pending. I wonder if D.H.C.R. has lost the file? How long does it take for them to rule on appeals? . . . Melvin Schechter, Manhattan.
 
 A "The D.H.C.R. has not lost the file," said Marcia Hirsch, deputy counsel of the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal. "The matter is still pending."
In most cases, Ms. Hirsch said, petitions for administrative review are processed on a "first come, first served" basis. Currently, the division is processing administrative reviews on overcharge cases from 1992. 
 Gerry Garfinkle, deputy bureau chief of the division's overcharge bureau, said that appeals may be expedited in certain situations -- but only on a case-by-case basis and for good cause. Among the considerations that may warrant expedited processing, Mr. Garfinkle said, are situations where a court proceeding has been commenced and a tenant is threatened with imminent eviction. In addition, he said, expedited processing is also available in cases of extreme hardship (terminal illness, pending foreclosure or pending bankruptcy on the part of any of the parties) or where tenants are exposed to dangerous conditions in a building.
Expedited processing is also available when a court order requires such processing, or when a determination is needed to resolve a matter pending before another governmental agency, or when a determination of the subject matter is needed to resolve a companion or related matter before a governmental agency.
If a party involved in a petition for administrative review fits any of those criteria, Mr. Garfinkle said, he or she can request expedited processing by writing to the Director of the Overcharge PAR Bureau, 92-31 Union Hall Street, Jamaica, N.Y. 11433. Included in the letter should be the docket number of the case and the reasons underlying the request.
"In the meantime," Mr. Garfinkle said, "Mr. Schechter should be paying the reduced rent as set forth in the Rent Administrator's order." Mr. Schechter said that he was, indeed, paying the lower rent.

 Trust Deed Vs. a Mortgage
 
Q What is meant by trust deed financing? How is it different from mortgage financing? . . . Tatsuya Haverhurst, Manhattan.
 
 A Michael Schlesinger, a Manhattan lawyer, said that the differences between trust deed financing and mortgage financing generally related to who holds title to the property while the loan is being repaid and what happens in the event of a default.
With mortgage financing, he said, a borrower retains title but pledges real estate as security for a loan. That pledge, evidenced by the mortgage document, creates a lien on the property. If the borrower fails to pay the loan in accordance with the agreed-upon terms, the lender can start a court proceeding -- a foreclosure action -- to force the sale of the property to satisfy the loan.
With trust-deed financing, however, instead of signing a mortgage, a borrower executes a deed of trust conveying title to the property to a third party, called a trustee. The trustee -- usually chosen by the lender -- then holds title to the property "in trust" as security for the lender.
When the loan is repaid the trustee conveys title back to the borrower. However, in the event of a default by the borrower, the trustee is empowered by the terms of the trust deed to sell the property and apply the proceeds of the sale to the loan.
Accordingly, the major distinction between the two types of financing is that while a foreclosure sale of a mortgaged property always requires court action and judicial approval, the foreclosure and sale of a property secured by a deed of trust can often occur without court approval.
In most cases, Mr. Schlesinger said, the type of financing available in a particular state is governed by whether that state views financing of real estate as a contract or a lien. Georgia and Alaska, for example, are contract states and permit trust-deed financing. New York, New Jersey and Connecticut are lien states and do not.

HEADLINE: Advice About A Noisy Fan

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The lawyer Eric Davis's advice to a tenant who complained of his neighbor's noisy fan contained several errors.
Mr. Davis suggested filing an action with the "city's Rent Control Board." To my knowledge, there is no such agency. If Mr. Davis were referring to the Rent Guidelines Board, its mandate is to determine rent increases for rent-stabilized apartments, but in no way does the guidelines board adjudicate disputes between landlords and tenants. 
 Mr. Davis then suggested that the tenant might file a complaint with the "State Department of Housing Preservation and Development." H.P.D., however, is a city, and not a state, agency, and it does not involve itself in the type of "L&T" dispute about which the tenant wrote.
Mr. Davis may have intended to refer to the Division of Housing and Community Renewal ("D.H.C.R."), which in fact is a state agency and which does involve itself in various types of landlord/tenant disputes.
Based upon that Manhattan tenant's allegations, the most appropriate avenue for redress probably would be through the city's Housing Court at 111 Centre Street. One notes, though, that perhaps the only major issue on which landlords and tenants agree is that the Housing Court system is too usually frustrating and in desperate need of overhaul.
Thus, I suggest that the tenant follow Mr. Davis's advice and (1) buy a rug, and (2) ask his neighbor to be a bit more considerate.

HEADLINE: New Views of Old Friends Along the Seashore

BYLINE: By STEWART KAMPEL 

 BODY:
FOR centuries lighthouses have stood as the seafarers' beacons, the prime notification of danger ahead. Long Island's lighthouses have also served as a welcoming sign to whalers and others in search of safe land.
Because of their prominence and their perpendicular stance, the lighthouses have always been a favorite of photographers. Now, a Long Island photographer, Margaret Casella of East Williston, has put a twist on her photographs of the lighthouses and, at the same time, she said, her work has brought her in closer contact with their historical significance. 
 "So many of the lighthouses are in a sorry state of neglect," she said. "Historical societies have taken up the slack in some cases to preserve and protect the lighthouse, but the need is great for public awareness.
In the New York area, the "lights" reflect the growth of shipping to and from the principal port of New York City via routes northeast of the city where Long Island Sound meets the East River. The lighthouses relate, as well, to the more general history of local Long Islanders, who have had a long history of participation in seagoing activities.
"The threat of vandalism and decay from the sea is great," Ms. Casella said, noting that automation has taken over the role of the lighthouse keeper and economy has necessitated the installation of steel towers instead of the traditional masonry houses.
To achieve the photographic effect, Ms. Casella uses the technique of emulsion transfer, altering the traditional Polaroid method.
Emulsion transfer, she explained, is a process in which the thin layer of emulsion of a Polaroid photograph is transferred to another surface. She uses 8 by 10 Polaroid No. 889 film and 4 by 5 Polaroid No. 59.
Working directly from a studio camera, she makes the photograph, lets it dry for a few days and then proceeds with the transfer process. She floats the photograph is a tray of water that is just under the boiling point. When the emulsion begins to float away, she transfers it to a tray of cool water that has a piece of acetate on the bottom to catch the emulsion. She catches the emulsion on the acetate and moves it around to achieve the image, which appears as a reverse image. Then she presses the emulsion and the acetate onto a damp surface, peels away the acetate and lets it dry.
Depending on the amount and thickness of folds the photographer has added to the emulsion, the surface will need to be protected by spraying with a protective coat of plastic.
There are 16 lighthouses on Long Island. Montauk Point Light was the first, constructed in 1796. The Huntington Harbor Point Light, constructed in 1912, was the last.

HEADLINE: Squid Popularity Aids Fishermen

BYLINE: By RAMIN P. JALESHGARI 

 BODY:
ONCE only caught for bait, squid, a mollusk that has long been popular on Mediterranean, Asian and southern European menus, was little more than an overabundant throwaway for Long Island fishermen..
Even up to 15 years ago squid fetched fishermen barely 10 cents a pound. Today the price is more that $1 a pound, and squid, or calamari, as it is increasingly being called, has become fancy fare at gourmet restaurants and seafood markets. 
 To help fishermen tap into consumers' changing tastes, the Cornell Cooperative Extension Division in Riverhead has begun a program to encourage fishermen to remain in business by going after underexploited and underfished species.
"Local fishermen have taken a hard hit in recent years," said an agent at Cornell Cooperative Extension, Emerson Hasbrouck. "The marine stocks traditionally depended upon flounder and cod, for example, but these are greatly reduced in numbers. So there has been much legislation to prohibit their overharvesting.
"To literally stay afloat, it has become imperative for those dependent on the Long Island fishing industry to change their approaches. With this in mind we've been working on a program to help commercial fishermen and those in the processing sector survive."
The Long Island Fisheries Assistance Program, the name of the extension division project, aims to encourage fishermen to remain in the business by turning away from depleted varieties. The program, which also plans to aid processors to modernize, is financed by the Empire State Development, a state agency, and the Economic Development Administration of the Federal Commerce Department. More than $1 million has been appropriated for the assistance program.
In 1994, sales of squid nationwide totaled 215 million pounds, according to the American Institute of Food Distributors Inc. In 1989 the total was 127 million. Because the statistics group the Long Island catch with the mid-Atlantic region, Cornell said, there was no way to know the total for Long Island fishermen.
In addition to expanding sales nationwide, the fishermen are being encouraged to sell more squid abroad.
"Traditional North and Mid-Atlantic harvests such as haddock, cod, and flounder have been overexploited," a senior scientist at the National Marine Fisheries Services, Dr. Emory Anderson, said. "At this point even previously underutilized fish like squid, monkfish and shark are fully exploited, and if aggressive harvesting continues, will become overexploited within a few years. Right now the two most abundant species in the Mid-Atlantic area, of which Long Island is a part, are herring and mackerel, neither of which are very popular in U.S. markets."
Dr. Anderson said 28 percent of the 200 species in American zones were overexploited, 35 percent fully exploited, 22 percent unknown and 15 percent underexploited.
Changing ethnicity on Long Island may be a factor for the local increase in popularity. Asian immigrants, one of the fastest growing group of newcomers, use squid widely, including in soups and entrees. And squid is finding favor among local residents as well as other immigrant groups.
At Bairrada's, a Portuguese market in Farmingville, two customers, Mark Sanchez and his wife, Gilda Lopes dos Santos, bought calamri to barbecue.
"We don't just get squid here," Mr. Sanchez said. "I've noticed fresh squid for sale at Pathmark, as well."
Mr. Sanchez also said most of the Portuguese restaurants that he had visited on Long Island offered many squid dishes.
"Our squid sales have doubled in the last five years," said Kenny Homan, president of the George Braun Oyster Company, a 68-year-old business in Cutchogue that supplies 750 restaurants on the Island.
The demand for squid and other seafood is increasing on menus at chains like Long John Silver's and at small hometown restaurants like the Steam Room in Port Jefferson.
At Long Island Seafood Export Inc. in Greenport, the president, Richard Lofstadt, said: "We realized that in order to make money we had to move into exporting what was available and at the same time in demand. Squid turned out to be the most plentiful. Through the assistance program we got money to buy a state-of-the-art squid-skinning machine. We used to be able to skin about 300 pounds a day by hand. that was with 10 to 15 people working. With the machine we skin about 3,000 pounds of squid for daily packaging."
The company sells most of the squid frozen, for domestic and export use. The assistance program also helped Mr. Lofstadt and his partner, John Scotti, buy a new freezer.
"Thanks to the program," Mr. Scotti said, "we were also able to upgrade to Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point standards, which is a stringent sanitary-condition control method. It required that we reoutfit our plan with all washable surfaces and monitor our freezers with a temperature-control log."
All European buyers follow the standards. American processors that do not follow them cannot sell to Italy and Portugal, for example.
A survey by the National Restaurant Association indicates that more than half the American restaurants that were questioned have experienced increases in orders for fish. In 1950 the world consumed 20 million tons of seafood, according to industry figures. The numbers increased steadily, until reaching a high of 100 million tons, or 42 pounds a person, in 1989.
Since 1989 consumption has decreased. Projections by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization put consumption rates at 24 pounds a person by 2030.
A troller captain from Mattituck, James Kaminsky, said he hoped to expand to grow oysters with the help of the assistance program. "For me," Mr. Kaminsky said, "trolling seemed to be falling apart, mostly because New York State laws are so restrictive.
"There are size restrictions on what they call weak fish, fish with reduced numbers. In New York you can only keep weak fish above 16 inches. But by the time they reach that size they migrate to New Jersey, where there are no size restrictions on the catch. After being a fisherman my whole life I had to look for something else. I decided to try and grow oysters."
With an $8,000 grant Mr. Kaminsky will try to establish indoor tanks for 300,000 oysters with a two-year maturation goal. "If it all works out," he said, "I hope to enlarge the operation and make it a lot bigger. I'd like to have a stable business I can pass on to my son."
Mariculture Technologies of Southold received the largest grant, $450,000. That company is setting up pens for open-ocean aquaculture of flounder, the first in the nation.
"I was a fish salesman for 22 years," the head of the company, Robert Link, said, "and I learned the hard way about the consequences of overexploiting ocean stocks of popular fish. It got to the point that I had nothing to sell to buying customers. So I looked into fish farms. There were plenty of catfish farms, but none for flounder. And my clients wanted flounder. That's when I got the idea for Mariculture Technologies."
Under the grant Mr. Link has to share information about the seafood industry with the public. He has a site on the Internet at http:// www.javatown.com that has registered more than 30,000 visitors. The site offers educational and product information.
Other participants in the assistance program have gone other routes.
One, Chris Gagagiva, of K&S Fisheries in Montauk, a long-line fisherman his whole career, is outfitting his boat with tanks to hold live fish to sell to Asian restaurants.
On the average live fish bring prices 200 percent more than iced fish. The higher prices can help make up for decreased volume.
"There aren't much fish to be caught anymore," Mr. Gagaviva said. "And with nothing to sell you can't make a profit. These live tanks are a brand spanking new angle for me, and I'm really enthusiastic to see how far it can go."
Another project involved training fishermen to respond to hazardous-waste cleanups. The assistance program intended to help fishermen find alternative training and income.
Classes were given by the National Response Corporation of Calverton, which works on oil spills globally, including a 40,000-gallon spill on May 9 by a tanker in Delaware Bay.
"We trained 25 active fishermen through a 40-hour course that qualified them to be used by us or any other company as a cleanup-augmentation crew," an instructor, Art Major, said.
More than 100 fishermen responded to an advertisement for the 25 slots in the course.
"It was great to be part of the program, because I got to stay on the water," said Mario Carrera, a shellfisher who has moved into aquaculture. "Most importantly the program trained us to be proactive in protecting the marine environment, which is absolutely crucial if we, as fishermen, want to stay in business."
Mr. Carrera was first in the hazardous waste training class and works part-time for National Response. He trains Consolidated Edison Company employees to drive boats and deploy cleanup booms.
More than 15 fishermen and processors have reorganized. But larger problems continue. Mr. Carrera said none of his fellow trainees had been called. Others in the program have been unable to refit their boats.
Mr. Carrera said he would like to see additional long-term training. "It would be great to get some acquaculture training going or, maybe, school programs where fishermen could teach kids or even companies about the importance of the sea," he said. "We have a lot of life experience to offer."
A former fishermen, Martyn Randall of St. James, said he was glad to see such programs. "It's a hard business being a fisherman," he said. "For one thing you need huge capital outlay to be successful, and then there's the danger factor. I've had buddies die, drown or go overboard and get caught in the lines. There should be more programs like this to help fishermen get on their feet, because I think Walter Scott said it best when he said: 'It's not fish you're buying. It's men's lives.' "
