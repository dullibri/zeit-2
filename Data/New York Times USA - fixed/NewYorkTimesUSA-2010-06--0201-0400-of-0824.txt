HEADLINE: In Iowa, Other Issues Crowd Out Gay Marriage

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY

 BODY:
DES MOINES -- When Iowa became the first Midwestern state to legalize same-sex marriage a year ago, opponents said the issue would drive future political races, and some even pledged to work to remove the State Supreme Court justices behind the decision. 
 With Iowans going to polls on Tuesday, same-sex marriage has been a matter of debate among the Republican candidates for governor, but the issue appears to have been overtaken by voters' worries about jobs, the economy and the state's budget misery.
 ''Too many other things are upsetting people,'' said David A. Yepsen, director of the Paul Simon Public Policy Institute at Southern Illinois University and a former political reporter for The Des Moines Register.
 Mr. Yepsen said the race for governor had essentially been transformed into a referendum on the performance of Gov. Chet Culver, a Democrat seeking his second term.
 At least 2,020 same-sex couples have married in Iowa since the State Supreme Court unanimously ruled in April 2009 that a state law barring such unions was unconstitutional. The ruling set off a flurry of efforts to take the matter to voters, but any such referendum on a constitutional amendment requires the approval of two consecutive General Assemblies, and the Democratic-led legislature has resisted the notion.
 Mr. Culver is unopposed in Tuesday's Democratic primary, but three Republicans -- including former Gov. Terry Branstad -- want to replace him. All three say they favor allowing a vote on a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage, but one of the candidates, Bob Vander Plaats, has gone further, calling for an effort to remove the three justices on the State Supreme Court, who are all on the ballot this November. 
 Mr. Branstad, who departed a dozen years ago after four terms and who, as governor, signed the state law banning same-sex marriage that was struck down last year, holds a 28-point lead in the latest poll by The Des Moines Register.
 Some of the strongest opponents of same-sex marriage, including the Iowa Family Policy Center, say the issue remains crucial here (The Register's poll found that 77 percent of Republican voters said the issue should be brought to the voters).
 The policy center's political action committee has endorsed Mr. Vander Plaats and taken the unusual step of announcing that it will not support anyone in November if Mr. Branstad is the Republican nominee. 
 Bryan English, a spokesman for the center, acknowledged that efforts to remove Iowa's justices had gained little steam, but said that his group intended to single out state legislative races in the fall in an effort shift the partisan balance there. 
 Supporters of same-sex marriage say Iowans are mostly tired of the issue. 
 ''They want to move on,'' said Justin Uebelhor, a spokesman for One Iowa, a gay advocacy group. ''They want elected officials to focus on jobs, the economy, improving schools.''

HEADLINE: Obama Gives Students a Principle to Guide Them

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

 BODY:
KALAMAZOO, Mich. -- President Obama has been telling the nation that he takes responsibility for cleaning up the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. On Monday, he imparted his buck-stops-here philosophy to an audience of high school graduates, telling them: ''Don't make excuses. Take responsibility not just for your successes. Take responsibility where you fall short as well.'' 
 Mr. Obama spent the morning in Washington meeting with cabinet officials to discuss the oil spill. Hours later, he was standing in a university gymnasium before about 280 graduates and their families as the commencement speaker for Kalamazoo Central High School, which won a nationwide competition to promote his Race to the Top education initiative.
 Mr. Obama, whose 17-month-old presidency has had its share of ups and downs, warned the graduates that they would have their share, too. 
 ''The truth is, no matter how hard you work, you're not going to ace every class,'' he said. ''You're not going to succeed the first time you try something. There will be times when you screw up, when you hurt the people you love. There will be times when you make a mistake and you stray from the values that you hold most deeply.''
 The Kalamazoo speech was Mr. Obama's first high school commencement address as president; his predecessor, George W. Bush, delivered the 2008 commencement address in Greensburg, Kan., a small town that was practically wiped off the map by a deadly tornado.
 The White House said Mr. Obama wanted to spotlight a school that was striving to achieve.
 The school is ethnically and socioeconomically diverse; half the students are African-American, more than 70 percent qualify for federal lunch assistance, and many find it difficult to afford college. In choosing Kalamazoo Central from more than 1,000 applicants, the White House cited a privately financed program, Kalamazoo Promise, backed by anonymous donors, that guarantees scholarships covering 65 percent to 100 percent of the cost of tuition for every graduate. 
 In his advice to the graduates, Mr. Obama evoked memories of his own youth, telling the students he did not truly understand the value of perseverance when he was their age.
 ''Sometimes I was rebellious. Sometimes I partied a little too much,'' he said. ''But after a few years, after I was living solely on my own, and I realized living solely for my own entertainment wasn't so entertaining anymore -- and it wasn't particularly satisfying anymore.''
 Mr. Obama has spoken often of the importance of personal responsibility, especially in urging parents to be more engaged in raising their children. He returned to the responsibility theme in Kalamazoo, paired the message with a lament about Washington finger-pointing, when he said, ''It's the easiest thing in the world to start looking around for someone to blame.''
 In urging the graduates to take on the challenges facing the country, he circled back to the oil spill in the gulf, which has gotten him caught up in that blame game. 
 ''We've got an economy to rebuild, children to educate, diseases to cure,'' Mr. Obama said. ''We've got threats to face; we've got an oil spill to clean up.''

HEADLINE: The Golden (State) Mean

BYLINE: By JILL STEWART. 
Jill Stewart is the deputy news editor at Los Angeles Weekly.

 BODY:
Los Angeles
 BARRING a major upset in today's primary, Meg Whitman, the former chief executive of eBay, will be chosen over Steve Poizner, California's insurance commissioner, as the Republican nominee for governor. 
 If this comes to pass, it will show once again California's ability to defy -- or maybe set? -- national trends. While fringe candidates and extreme positions are winning races nationwide, in California, the gubernatorial primary this year has been about wooing and holding the center.
 The two wealthy candidates -- Ms. Whitman's fortune is well known, Mr. Poizner earned his from digital mapping and G.P.S. innovations -- have spent a cool $105 million since the beginning of 2009. In a state where only about 31 percent of voters are registered Republicans, Ms. Whitman drove straight for the center with a saturation campaign highly focused on jobs, schools and government overspending. She soon attracted enough Democrats and ''decline to state'' independents to beat the presumptive Democratic nominee, Jerry Brown -- the former governor, Oakland mayor and now attorney general -- in ''what if'' polls about the general election in November. 
 In March, Mr. Poizner fell by as many as 50 percentage points behind Ms. Whitman before he began spending heavily. Then he hammered her special stock deals from Goldman Sachs and took a hard-right stance on illegal immigration, claiming that Ms. Whitman's views on the issue were indistinguishable from Barack Obama's. It worked for a time and Mr. Poizner, a dull speaker but one who holds a black belt in Shotokan karate, drew within single-digits of his opponent.
 To her campaign's credit, Ms. Whitman remained focused on her three-prong message about jobs, schools and government overspending. When immigration became a weakness for her, she quickly made her ''absolutely no amnesty, period'' stance a key element of her campaign ads. Within weeks, she regained a solid lead. 
 The twist here is that until this race, Mr. Poizner represented the pragmatic wing of the California Republican Party -- one that is largely focused on state government issues like the public-employee pension time bomb, heavy business regulations, the state's woeful lack of job creation and the government's inability to fix the schools.
 But when Ms. Whitman, ultrapragmatic business czar, snatched that ground away from Mr. Poizner, he tacked right. And it was then that the race started to mimic the familiar Republican struggle between those who want the party focused on economic issues like high taxes, and those who want it focused on social issues like immigration.
 Mr. Poizner could still eke out a victory, but his moderate baggage as a Silicon Valley Republican makes it hard to imagine the far right rushing to the polls to save his hide, and most state voters polled have said they would not select candidates based solely on the immigration brawl.
 Against the backdrop of Republican mudslinging, Jerry Brown is looking like a genius for refusing to spend any serious time or money -- a paltry $540,000 -- running for the Democratic nomination, which he is virtually certain to win today. 
 Mr. Brown was helped by Mr. Poizner, who ran lots and lots of ads making clear that Ms. Whitman had not been nearly enough of an immigration hardliner and reminding voters of her ties to Goldman Sachs. Polls now show Mr. Brown running slightly ahead of Ms. Whitman.
 What's next? Democrats will try to portray Ms. Whitman as a raging conservative, an effort that will intensify this week when Latino elected leaders, the rough-and-tumble California Nurses Association and other Democratic groups pump up their anti-Whitman campaigns. Whether she can withstand such an assault led by Mr. Brown, a politician far more nimble and camera-friendly than Mr. Poizner, is an open question.
 Still, despite a $21 million campaign chest and generous support from Sacramento's hard-charging government employee unions, Mr. Brown does not have the easiest of roads ahead. To win, he needs an energized left, and that might be tough given that Latino elected leaders in California are deeply suspicious of him. As the mayor of Oakland, Mr. Brown frequently refused to play interest-group politics and repeatedly angered black leaders on that count -- a history that has left urban Latino politicians uneasy and wondering if he will be willing to embrace their agenda. If he has to move left to satisfy these constituencies, will he then be forced to give up his moderate bona fides?
 California is about to see what happens when a not particularly rock-ribbed conservative Republican meets a not very hardcore liberal Democrat. In contrast to the campaigns in much of the nation, this will be a race to the center, as the nominees for both parties attempt to tar the other as the fringe candidate. Meg Whitman and Jerry Brown will both try to convince Californians -- who for many years have elected as governor the candidate, regardless of party, best able to portray himself as a pragmatic centrist -- that they are the real deal.

HEADLINE: Medicaid Cut Places States In Budget Bind

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK

 BODY:
Having counted on Washington for money that may not be delivered, at least 30 states will have to close larger-than-anticipated shortfalls in the coming fiscal year unless Congress passes a six-month extension of increased federal spending on Medicaid.
 Governors and state lawmakers, already facing some of the toughest budgets since the Great Depression, said the repercussions would extend far beyond health care, forcing them to make deep cuts to education, social services and public safety. 
 Gov. Edward G. Rendell of Pennsylvania, for instance, penciled $850 million in federal Medicaid assistance into the revenue side of his state's ledger, reducing its projected shortfall to $1.2 billion. The only way to compensate for the loss, he said in an interview, would be to lay off at least 20,000 government workers, including teachers and police officers, at a time when the state is starting to add jobs.
 ''It would actually kill everything the stimulus has done,'' said Mr. Rendell, a Democrat. ''It would be enormously destructive.'' 
 The Medicaid provision, which would extend assistance first granted in last year's stimulus package, was considered such a sure bet by many governors and legislative leaders that they prematurely included the money in their budgeting. But under pressure from conservative Democrats to rein in deficit spending, House leaders in late May eliminated $24 billion in aid to states from a tax and jobs bill that was approved and forwarded to the Senate.
 The Senate plans to take up the measure this week, and the majority leader, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, favors restoring the money, said his spokesman, Jim Manley. The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, signaled last week that her chamber was open to reconsidering the appropriation.
 But state and Congressional officials said the evolving politics of a midterm election year meant that the federal aid could no longer be taken for granted. And if it does not arrive, it will leave gaping shortages for states that are already slashing services and raising taxes to balance their recession-racked budgets.
 According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, states are relying on the money to close more than a fourth of the $89 billion in cumulative budget shortfalls projected for the 2011 fiscal year, which starts on July 1 in 46 states.
 In California, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger's proposed budget assumed $1.5 billion in increased federal aid for Medicaid. With his state reeling from $57 billion in cuts over three years and facing a shortfall of $19 billion in 2011, further reductions would be ''both cruel and counterproductive,'' Mr. Schwarzenegger, a Republican, wrote to members of Congress last week.
 In New York, which started its fiscal year on April 1 without a financial plan, Gov. David A. Paterson's proposed budget included $1.1 billion in unsecured federal financing. Mr. Paterson, who is depending on the money to narrow a $9.2 billion gap, joined Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York City at Gracie Mansion on Thursday to lobby their state's Congressional delegation.
 Governors and state lawmakers were caught largely by surprise by the House's removal of the appropriation. Over the previous 10 months, the Medicaid money had been included in separate bills passed by each chamber, and President Obama had wrapped the extension into his executive budget proposal. 
 ''There was every reason to think they'd get together,'' Mr. Rendell said.
 But in recent weeks, Republicans and conservative Democrats began to complain that the proposed spending would add to the deficit because it was not ''paid for'' with new revenue or other cuts. Their success in reducing the size of the bill reflected a deepening debate in Congress -- and on the campaign trail -- about the long-term consequences of using deficit spending to fight the recession. 
 Democratic aides in both the House and the Senate said state officials had not pressed their case forcefully enough.
 ''We may have fallen asleep at the wheel a little bit because we took it as a certainty for so long,'' said Michael Bird, federal affairs counsel for the National Council of State Legislatures. 
 Republican governors in particular, the aides said, had been reluctant to petition for relief while the party's leaders in Congress were criticizing Democrats for driving up the national debt. 
 ''Governors need to make it clear that it is vital that their states receive this money, instead of blasting Congress for 'out-of-control spending,' '' said a senior Democratic aide in the House, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk about the issue publicly.
 But the need to balance state and federal interests makes for awkward politics for some governors. Timing has made the conflict more pronounced because state budgets typically do not recover until well after a national recession fades. 
 ''I'm very concerned about the level of federal spending and what it would mean for the long term,'' said Gov. Jim Douglas of Vermont, a Republican and chairman of the National Governors Association. ''But for the short term, states need this bridge to sustain the safety net of human services programs and education.''
 A report issued Thursday by the National Governors Association and the National Association of State Budget Officers projected that state revenues would ''remain sluggish'' for two more years. State general fund spending declined by nearly $75 billion, or 11 percent, from 2008 to 2010, according to the report. But states, which unlike the federal government must balance their budgets, avoided even harsher cuts because of nearly $135 billion in stimulus grants from Washington.
 The aid included $87 billion made available by adjusting how states and the federal government share the growing cost of Medicaid, the health insurance program for the poor and the disabled. The economic downturn is expected to drive up enrollment in the program by 21 percent from 2009 to 2011, according to the report.
 Although the federal Medicaid share varies by state, the stimulus act raised it to an average of 66 percent, from 57 percent, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.
 The reimbursement increase was limited to a 27-month period that ends on Dec. 31. Almost as soon as it took effect, governors began fretting about the fiscal precipice they would face when the enhanced payments ended. In February, governors from 42 states and several territories signed a letter to Congressional leaders pleading for a six-month extension.
 But with the public alarmed about deficit spending, House leaders found that they could not muster the Democratic votes needed to pass the tax and jobs bill without jettisoning several expensive components. 
 In a conference call with bloggers last week, Ms. Pelosi, Democrat of California, took note of the changed political climate, calling the package ''too large for members to digest.''
 ''If I had all the votes that I needed in the non-Blue Dog world,'' she said, referring to the caucus of conservative Democrats, ''I would not have had to make some of the changes I made to get some of the Blue Dog support.'' 
 Many states do not have contingencies for replacing the federal money. Their options will be limited by the severity of the steps they already have taken, and by federal requirements that they maintain eligibility levels for Medicaid. 
 ''We don't have a specific list of things we would do if we don't get the money,'' said Erik Kriss, a spokesman for Mr. Paterson's budget office, ''but we are looking for the most part at the cut side of the ledger.''

HEADLINE: 'A Very Deep Hole'

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
I know the president has a lot on his mind, but the No. 1 problem facing the U.S. continues to fester, and that problem is unemployment.
 The jobs report for May, released on Friday by the Labor Department, was grim. President Obama tried to put the best face on it, but it was undeniably bad news, which is why the stock markets tanked. The private sector created just 41,000 jobs in May, a dismal performance. The government hired 411,000 workers to help with the census, but those jobs are temporary and will vanish in a few months.
 Unemployment is crushing families and stifling the prospects of young people. Given that reality, President Obama's take on the May numbers seemed oddly out of touch. ''This report,'' he said, ''is a sign that our economy is getting stronger by the day.'' 
 The economy is sick, and all efforts to revive it that do not directly confront the staggering levels of joblessness are doomed. Even the meager job growth in the private sector last month was composed mostly of temporary work. Lawrence Mishel, the president of the Economic Policy Institute, had the right take when he said, ''These new data do not present a picture of a healthy private sector and offer nothing even closely resembling the job growth we need to dig us out of a very deep hole.''
 More than 15 million Americans are out of work, and nearly half have been jobless for six months or longer. New college graduates are having a terrible time finding work, and many are taking jobs that require only a high school education. Teachers are facing the worst employment market since the Depression. 
 Entire communities are going under. A remarkable article in The Times last week detailed what has happened in Memphis, where a majority of the residents are black. It said the city epitomizes ''how rising unemployment and growing foreclosures in the recession have combined to destroy black wealth and income and erase two decades of slow progress.''
 The median income of black homeowners in Memphis has dropped to a level below that of 1990.
 It's impossible to overstate the threat that this crisis of unemployment poses to the well-being of the United States. With so many people out of work and so much of the rest of the population deeply in debt, where is the spending going to come from to power a true economic recovery? The deficit hawks are forecasting Armageddon, but how is anyone going to get a handle on the federal deficits if we don't get millions of people back to work and paying taxes?
 Some inner-city neighborhoods, where joblessness is off the charts, are becoming islands of despair. Rural communities and rust belt cities and towns are experiencing their own economic nightmares.
 There is no plan that I can see to get us out of this fix. Drastic cuts in government spending would only compound the crisis. State and local governments, for example, are shedding workers as we speak. 
 Policy makers have acted as if they are unaware of the magnitude of this crisis. They have behaved as though somehow, through some economic magic perhaps, or the power of prayer, this ocean of joblessness will just disappear. That's a pipe dream.
 Even if we somehow experienced a sudden, extraordinary surge in job growth (which no one is expecting), it would take a very long time just to get back to the level of employment that we had when the recession started in late-2007. 
 Heidi Shierholz, an economist with the Economic Policy Institute, addressed this. ''In the boom of the late-1990s,'' she said, ''the fastest year of employment growth was 2.6 percent, in 1998. If, in the event we have that extremely strong level of growth from here on out, we would still not get down to pre-recession unemployment rates until January 2015.''
 For all the money that has been spent so far, the Obama administration and Congress have not made the kinds of investments that would put large numbers of Americans back to work and lead to robust economic growth. What is needed are the same things that have been needed all along: a vast program of infrastructure repair and renewal; an enormous national investment in clean energy aimed at transforming the way we develop and use energy in this country; and a transformation of the public schools to guarantee every child a first-rate education in a first-rate facility.
 This would be a staggeringly expensive and difficult undertaking and would entail a great deal of shared sacrifice. (It would also require an end to our insane waste of resources on mindless and endless warfare.) The benefits over the long term would be enormous.
 Bold and effective leadership would have put us on this road to a sustainable future. Instead, we're approaching a dead end.

BYLINE: KATHERINE SCHULTEN


HIGHLIGHT: Here's a round-up of interesting Times stuff to celebrate this year's graduates (and those who teach them).

 BODY:
Here's a round-up of interesting Times stuff to celebrate this year's graduates (and those who teach them).
Under the heading "Read" we've listed Nicholas D. Kristof's recent "The Best Commencement Speeches Ever," but we also have archival Times articles about commencements from 1901, 1951, 1969 and 1980. Compare and contrast!
Just the opening paragraph from Russell Baker's June 12, 1969 "Observer" column alone should be enough to entice you:
Thirty years from now, which will be the year 1999, the college revolutionaries who are graduating this June will be making commencement speeches to a new generation of graduates. Unless their style changes, their speeches will sound very much like this: [...]
To "Watch" we include video of President Obama's controversial commencement speech at Notre Dame last May, as well as our only non-Times resource, a retrospective in rap called "The Last 18 Years." 
Our "Teach" category includes a handful of lesson plans on commencement addresses, college, and life after high school.
Finally, under "Do," we invite you to answer our Student Opinion question, "Whom Would You Choose As Your Commencement Speaker?"
And if you're still nostalgic about the decade in which you came of age, our "Decade That Was" Fill-In remains one of the most popular things we've ever published on this blog.

HEADLINE: Cape Cod Residents Keep the Chain Stores Out

BYLINE: By BETH GREENFIELD

 BODY:
PROVINCETOWN, Mass. -- It was a family-owned T-shirt shop that sent Barbara Rushmore on a mission to ban chain stores from this quaint and quirky seaside town.
 ''Cuffy's came to town and demolished the business of many who designed and made their own shirts in their stores,'' said Ms. Rushmore, a self-described gadfly who has also championed town bans on pay toilets and cigarette vending machines. Though Cuffy's has just two locations, both on Cape Cod, it is known for its Wal-Mart-like low prices: A recent sale at its Provincetown branch, opened in 2007, offered three hooded sweatshirts for $9.99. Its success with tourists here was instant.
 ''It occurred to me that, as bad as that is, imagine if we got a Burger King or McDonald's?'' Ms. Rushmore said. Stores like that would threaten the many independently owned businesses in town, she said, and compromise Provincetown's small-town New England charm. 
 She drafted an amendment to the town's zoning bylaw aimed at discouraging chain stores, or ''formula businesses,'' as they are legally termed. It would do this by requiring them to obtain both a permit from the Zoning Board of Appeals and site plan approval from the Planning Board. 
 Residents approved the amendment at the annual town meeting in April by a vote of 91 to 24, well above the two-thirds majority required. It immediately became law, though it can still be overturned by the state attorney general, Martha Coakley, whose decision is due by July 13. 
 The antichain store movement has been gaining momentum across the country for years, with towns like McCall, Idaho; Port Townsend, Wash.; Ogunquit, Me.; and Carmel-by-the-Sea, Calif., enacting laws that restrict such businesses. The ordinances work in one or a combination of ways: by requiring formula businesses to be approved for permits on a case-by-case basis, by not allowing such businesses to open at all in certain defined districts, by capping the number of chains allowed in the town, or by requiring chains to meet certain conditions. 
 Such laws are typically motivated by concerns about independent stores not being able to compete economically with large corporations, and about creative communities becoming homogenized and losing their appeal. 
 ''Let them in, and you could wind up killing the goose that laid the golden egg,'' said Stacy Mitchell, author of ''Big-Box Swindle'' (Beacon Press, 2006), and a staff member at the New Rules Project in Minneapolis, which advocates in favor of independently owned businesses and tracks local laws restricting chains across the country.
 In the area of Cape Cod and nearby islands, Nantucket restricted chain stores in its downtown in 2006, and since then the villages of Barnstable and Centerville and the towns of Dennis and Chatham have followed suit. In April, the state attorney general approved the bylaw in Chatham, where two residents championed the cause after a Dunkin' Donuts opened in 2009.
 ''The people in town were appalled,'' said one of those residents, Norm Pacun, a retired lawyer. Along with Gloria Freeman, Mr. Pacun examined 50 similar bylaws around the country before presenting their own via petition, with 300 signatures, at a town meeting. ''It was a combination of aesthetics and an attempt to retain the historic identity of this town,'' Mr. Pacun said. 
 The impulse to ban chain stores is not new, said Richard C. Schragger, a professor at the University of Virginia law school. In the 1930s the rapid expansion of Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company grocery stores gave rise to taxes on chains to prevent unfair competition. But today's movement, as Mr. Schragger sees it, has different motivations.
 ''In the '30s, it was about economic protectionism,'' he said. ''Today it's about aesthetics, traffic, things like that -- particularly in resort communities or in communities with a lot of wealth.''
 In her Provincetown bylaw, Ms. Rushmore said an influx of chain stores would ''have a negative impact on the town's economy'' as well as its ''historical relevance'' and ''unique character.'' It names the entirety of Provincetown as a Formula Business Regulated District, and then lays out the defining characteristics of a such a business, which must be one of 10 or more branches worldwide. In addition, a ''formula business'' would have to meet at least three of several criteria, including having a standardized menu or array of merchandise, and requiring standardized uniforms or signage. 
 The town's pre-existing formula stores -- Ben & Jerry's, Marc by Marc Jacobs and Stop & Shop currently among them -- are grandfathered in.
 Although regulations like Provincetown's would seem to raise concerns about restricting commerce, Mr. Schragger said they were legal if they were couched in terms of land-use or zoning, which local governments had the power to regulate. ''So if it's a land-use ordinance, a challenge based on the commerce clause of the Constitution will probably fail,'' he said. 
 ''What these ordinances do is limit these businesses,'' Ms. Mitchell said. ''The laws don't say 'Starbucks can't open,' which would violate the Constitution. What they say is that Starbucks would have to create a unique coffee shop that wouldn't be recognized as Starbucks. And, in general, this is a high enough hurdle to keep them out.'' 
 Opinions of the Provincetown bylaw among local business owners have been mixed.
 ''If suddenly Home Depot and McDonald's were to come in, it would be a different place. So I'm there in spirit,'' said Frank Vasello, the owner of a deli called Relish as he wiped down a display case on a recent afternoon. ''But I voted no. It didn't feel quite right to me. I'm concerned about the capriciousness of it. And the idea that I'm going to regulate away competition makes no sense.'' 
 Also of two minds was Howard Burchman, an innkeeper, a homeless-policy consultant and the chairman of the local planning board, which had formally recommended that the vote on this issue be delayed until more research could be done. ''It's a challenging situation,'' he said. ''Provincetown is a unique community district. If we have homogenization of the district, we end up losing the reason why people want to come here. But there is a difference between preserving that district and establishing protectionist barriers. And I think that's what this bylaw does.''

HEADLINE: 155 Workers, 6 Young Men, 1 Fiscal Mess

BYLINE: By JIM DWYER. 
E-mail: dwyer@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Every day brings dreadful news of some worthy cause that is going to be cut because government budgets are being hit with cannonballs.
 Today, for a change, we present some causes worthy of being cut.
 Take, for instance, a place called the Tryon Residential Center, run by the state agency in charge of juvenile justice. It is a place for children who get into trouble.
 State records show that 155 public employees are assigned to the boys section at Tryon. They oversee a total of six young men, lodged in a place that few people believe should exist anymore, and that is scheduled to be shut down by the end of the year. 
 Yet Tryon will remain completely staffed because the state is tied in a knot: two governors ago, the state promised public employee unions that it would give one year's notice before shutting down juvenile detention centers or adult prisons.
 So as of Tuesday, with six young people living there, here are some of the jobs still budgeted at Tryon: 11 cooks, 1 food manager, 6 keyboard specialists, 5 nurses, 1 motor mechanic, 7 teachers, 1 teaching assistant, 4 vocational instructors, 3 recreation specialists, 81 youth division aides and 2 calculations clerks.
 Also, one ''principal accounting clerk.''
 ''You would think common sense would say you don't need this facility, so close it,'' said Gladys Carrion, commissioner of the state's Office of Children and Family Services. ''I'm faced with the reality of having four or six kids in a facility and a full complement of staff. I have similar situations in other facilities. These beds cost $240,000 a year.''
 New York could change the state seal to an empty bed. One of the great successes of modern times has been the decline in crime, but in upstate New York, the prison economy depends on a steady supply of criminals. 
 Although thousands of adult cells are empty, it is hard to know if the state will be able to shut even the single medium-security prison that the Department of Correctional Services has said it no longer needs. 
 That prison, at Ogdensburg, has 287 employees on its roster, and 419 inmates, all of whom could be dispatched to empty cells elsewhere. But the number that weighs heaviest is not how many people are in the prison: it is how many people work there. And this prison is in a district represented by a Democratic senator, who naturally sees despair, locusts and Republicans overrunning the land should it be closed. There are 32 Democrats in the Senate, and 32 votes are needed to pass any legislation there. Every last one of them can be king or queen.
 Both the State Senate and the Assembly have stated they want Ogdensburg to stay open, even though the governor says it should be closed in January. 
 ''With all the state's fiscal problems,'' said Robert Gangi, the executive director of the Correctional Association of New York, ''this extraordinary waste should not be tolerated because of the usual reasons -- that these are important jobs in these communities, and because of the political pushback.''
 THAT pushback has taken grotesque forms. The juvenile detention system is run not by the corrections department, but by Commissioner Carrion's agency. She has been closing places like Tryon, which was cited last year for its brutality by the United States Justice Department. 
 In response, the unions representing workers in the detention centers, and various Republican legislators, have called for the commissioner to be fired. One senator accused her of permitting a near-orgy at a detention center in Goshen. Yet the evidence suggests that she has solid grounds for saying that such places are beyond reform. 
 In the Goshen case, four young men were permitted to invite four women to a social event at the center, a reward for having met goals. These eight young people were supervised by seven adults. Nevertheless, video footage shows that they were permitted to engage in intimate contact, according to a senior state official. 
 Gov. David A. Paterson has proposed legislation that would revamp how the state treats young people who get into trouble. For decades, they have been shipped far from home, into detention centers that often became a passageway to adult criminal life. A task force appointed by the governor said that under the existing system, the state was ''harming its children, wasting money and endangering its public.''
 ''This,'' the task force said, perhaps optimistically, ''cannot continue.''

HEADLINE: The Energy Debate in Congress

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''The Spill and Energy Bill'' (editorial, June 5):
 As you point out, the continuing disaster in the Gulf of Mexico provides a rallying point for President Obama to push for action on climate and energy legislation. But the Kerry-Lieberman proposal in the Senate is hardly the low-carbon vehicle needed to wean our nation off fossil fuels.
 Neither of the bill's sponsors has evinced a willingness to drop expansion of offshore oil drilling. Subsidies to coal and the dubious quest for carbon capture and storage will lock in continued use of this dirtiest of fuels for decades. Allowing polluters to purchase cheap carbon offsets will further delay America's conversion to clean energy. 
 If we're serious about ending our fossil fuel dependence, we must place a direct and steadily increasing fee on carbon. Returning the revenues from that fee equally to every American household will take the sting out of rising energy costs and build public support for the higher carbon price needed to retire fossil fuels.
 The antidote to dirty energy doesn't have to be perfect. It just has to be effective.
 Charles Komanoff New York, June 5, 2010
 The writer is director of the Carbon Tax Center. 
 To the Editor:
 You say the Senate energy bill is ''far from perfect.'' That's an understatement. You mention coddling the coal industry and write of offshore drilling safeguards that in the wake of the spill need to be revisited, but what about nuclear power?
 The Senate bill will not only allow the building of nuclear power plants, but will also weaken whatever safeguards we have in place, with its call for an ''expedited procedure for issuing combined construction and operating licenses for qualified new nuclear reactors.''
 Is this our answer to our dissatisfaction with corporate, government and expert assurances that whatever they're pushing it's safe?
 I'm beginning to think we're incapable of learning. Nuclear power plants expose us to risks far, far greater than anything we face with offshore drilling, and to make it easier to build them is reprehensible.
 Barry Rehfeld Editor, Zero Energy Intelligence.com New York, June 5, 2010
 To the Editor:
 ''You never want a serious crisis to go to waste,'' Rahm Emanuel, the White House chief of staff, famously said. The New York Times seems to agree. Your editorial tries to use the tragedy of the Deepwater Horizon spill to advance your agenda regarding cap and trade.
 We can all agree that we need to steadily decrease the percentage of oil in our nation's energy use. In fact, S. 1462, the American Clean Energy Leadership Act, which was passed by the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee last year on a strong bipartisan basis, would do exactly that. Though it has been waiting for Senator Harry Reid to calendar it for a year now, the bill doesn't rate a mention in your editorial.
 There has also been strong bipartisan agreement (including President Obama's previous statements) that command-and-control regulation by the Environmental Protection Agency is the worst form of greenhouse gas regulation. Despite this, the editorial argues against my resolution to stop the E.P.A. on the assertion that it would undercut the government's authority and reduce the anticipated oil savings from new fuel economy standards.
 In reality, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration retains full authority to increase fuel economy standards, and assertions that the resolution undercuts government authority ignore the fact that such authority comes only with the consent of the people.
 Lisa Murkowski Washington, June 7, 2010
 The writer, a United States senator from Alaska, is ranking member, Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.
 To the Editor:
 The energy bills coming out of both the House and the Senate prove yet again how utterly ineffectual our political system is at really solving the nation's biggest problems. The bills do not go nearly far enough to wean the United States off foreign oil or fossil fuels. The United States has the resources and technological capacity to do both, but we obviously don't have the will to make it happen.
 What is really needed is a John F. Kennedy man on the moon moment. Barack Obama should make the following statement to set in motion what is needed:
 ''In 15 years the United States will no longer import any more oil. The United States can become entirely energy self-sufficient using emerging and established clean energy sources, including a combination of nuclear, natural gas, solar, wind, geothermal and biofuels. To help pay for the transition, a simple yet substantial carbon tax will be implemented.''

HEADLINE: Plumes of Oil Below Surface Raise New Concerns

BYLINE: By JUSTIN GILLIS; John M. Broder and Henry Fountain contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The government and university researchers confirmed Tuesday that plumes of dispersed oil were spreading far below the ocean surface from the leaking well in the Gulf of Mexico, raising fresh concern about the potential impact of the spill on sea life.
 The tests, the first detailed chemical analyses of water from the deep sea, show that some of the most toxic components of the oil are not necessarily rising to the surface where they can evaporate, as would be expected in a shallow oil leak. Instead, they are drifting through deep water in plumes or layers that stretch as far as 50 miles from the leaking well. 
 As a rule, the toxic compounds are present at exceedingly low concentrations, the tests found, as would be expected given that they are being diluted in an immense volume of seawater.
 ''It's pretty clear that the oil that has been released is becoming more and more dilute,'' Jane Lubchenco, head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said in an interview. ''That does not mean it's unimportant -- far from it. The total amount of oil out there is likely very large, and we have yet to understand the full impact of all that hydrocarbon on the gulf ecosystem.''
 Scientists outside the government noted that the plumes appeared to be so large that organisms might be bathed in them for extended periods, possibly long enough to kill eggs or embryos. They said this possibility added greater urgency to the effort to figure out exactly how sea life was being affected, work that remains in its infancy six weeks after the Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded.
 ''I'm glad to see the levels are low,'' said Carys L. Mitchelmore, an aquatic toxicologist at the University of Maryland who was not involved in the research. ''But we're talking about a huge Gulf of Mexico here. I want to see evidence that this is one of the main plumes and there's not something way more concentrated somewhere else.''
 The announcement of test results came as the White House said President Obama would make his fourth trip to the region next week, visiting Mississippi, Alabama and Florida on Monday and Tuesday. 
 The results on the plumes came from samples taken by researchers at the University of South Florida, in St. Petersburg. NOAA helped finance the research and joined in Tuesday's announcement.
 The test results, from samples taken in late May aboard the research vessel Weatherbird II, appeared to confirm information first presented three weeks ago by another group of researchers, who found evidence of large plumes of dispersed oil droplets in the deep ocean.
 Those scientists have not yet completed their analysis of water samples, but one of them, Samantha Joye of the University of Georgia, supplied additional information at a news conference on Tuesday, including instrument readings taken on her most recent research cruise.
 Those readings suggest that a large plume, probably consisting of hydrocarbons from the leak, stretches through the deep ocean for at least 15 miles west of the gushing oil well, Dr. Joye said. The top of the plume is about 3,600 feet below the sea surface; the plume is three miles wide and as thick as 1,500 feet in spots, she said.
 The University of South Florida researchers found an even larger plume stretching northeast of the oil well, with the hydrocarbons separated into two distinct layers in the ocean. One layer is about 1,200 feet below the surface, and the other is 3,000 feet deep, the scientists said.
 The government's confirmation of subsea oil plumes is significant in part because BP, the oil company responsible for the leak, had denied that such plumes existed, and NOAA itself had previously been cautious in interpreting the preliminary results from Dr. Joye's group.
 ''The oil is on the surface,'' Tony Hayward, BP's chief executive, said last week. ''There aren't any plumes.''
 Descriptions of the plumes from the two groups of scientists are filling in details of one of the most remarkable findings to come from the disaster: the realization that much of the oil in a deepwater blowout may remain below the surface.
 The scientists say the plumes are not bubbles of oil, as many people have imagined them, but consist of highly dispersed or dissolved hydrocarbons. In some spots, enough oil is present to discolor the water, but in most places, water samples come up clear. Yet the dissolved hydrocarbons show up vividly on instruments, and they can be smelled in some samples.
 ''This so-called invisible oil, which people tend to have a hard time grasping, is detectable clearly using analytical methods,'' said Ernst Peebles, a University of South Florida oceanographer who helped carry out the research.
 Jeffrey Short, a marine scientist with Oceana, an advocacy group, said that even though the concentration of chemicals was low at any one locale, the magnitude of the plumes suggested a need for more research.
 ''We should, at a bare minimum, keep a much closer eye on how many plumes there are, how big they are, how long they last and what organisms they're affecting,'' Dr. Short said.
 As the government wrestled with the many safety issues raised by the disaster, it imposed a drilling freeze late last month that halted virtually all new oil exploration in the gulf. On Tuesday, the Obama administration announced new standards that will allow resumption of drilling in water less than 500 feet deep.
 All wells in water deeper than 500 feet remain under a moratorium for at least the next six months while a presidential panel studies the April 20 Deepwater Horizon explosion and makes recommendations on whether and how to resume such drilling.
 The new rules address some of the problems that investigators believe contributed to the blowout of the BP well, including failure of the blowout preventer and improper design or application of the cement around the well bore.
 ''Oil and gas from the outer continental shelf remains an important component of our energy security as we transition to the clean-energy economy,'' Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said Tuesday in a statement, ''but we must ensure that offshore drilling is conducted safely and in compliance with the law.''

HEADLINE: Fed Finding Status Quo In Bank Pay

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
Federal regulators reviewing the compensation policies of major banks are finding that the industry has not adequately adjusted its pay practices to reduce risk-taking.
 The Federal Reserve, six months into a compensation review of the country's 28 largest financial companies, has found that many of the bonus and incentive programs that economists say contributed to the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression remain in place, according to people briefed on the examinations.
 Officials have found, for example, that risk managers at several of the biggest banks still report to executives who have influence over their year-end bonuses and whose own pay might be constricted by curbing risk. In many cases, risk managers do not have full access to the compensation committee of the banks' boards. 
 The review also revealed that banks tend to set similar bonus formulas for broad sets of employees and often do not adjust payouts to account for risks taken by traders or mortgage lending officers. Bank executives and directors, meanwhile, are often in the dark on the pay arrangements of employees whose bets could have a potentially devastating impact on the company.
 The Federal Reserve's examination is focusing on the structure of compensation arrangements, not their amounts, and the results have not been made public. However, some preliminary findings emerged from interviews with government officials and bank executives who have been briefed on the review. 
 Last month, the Fed sent letters to the chief executives of each of the 28 banks detailing officials' concerns about their institution's pay practices. The letters ordered them to promptly make changes. 
 Bank officials are now in negotiations with federal officials over the steps they must take. The Fed is not expected to release its official report until next year, though it may provide new details when it releases a final set of pay guidelines that it has been working on at the same time. Those are expected in coming weeks. 
 The Fed's review is the latest in a flurry of federal efforts to rein in banker pay and is occurring as Congress works to reconcile bills passed by the House and the Senate that will further tighten the government's grip on the financial industry. Other agencies are also forging ahead with mixed success on compensation initiatives announced earlier this year, when it seemed that everyone in Washington was hoping to turn the politics of pay to their advantage. 
 Kenneth R. Feinberg, President Obama's pay czar for banks bailed out by the government, is combing through the compensation awarded from October 2008 to February 2009 to the 25 highest earners at each company that received bailout money. He plans to publicize the results within the next three weeks. 
 Only about 180 of the 420 companies that accepted bailout money were subject to his review, and Mr. Feinberg has no authority, other than the threat of public embarrassment, to renegotiate compensation arrangements that he finds objectionable. 
 Other government efforts have run into delays. The Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, proposed a global bank tax, partly based on executive compensation, at several recent meetings with finance ministers from the Group of 20 large economies. But that initiative has failed to attract broad support and faces resistance from Australia and Canada, whose banks generally withstood the crisis.
 Separately, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has pushed back a board vote on a controversial plan that would tie a bank's pay practices to the fees it pays to the agency's insurance fund. Under the proposal, lenders that use long-term stock to reward employees and those that adopt provisions to claw back compensation would pay less money into the fund, while riskier pay practices could lead to higher assessments. 
 The banking industry opposes the plan, arguing it could increase compliance costs and conflict with other regulatory efforts on compensation. The F.D.I.C. vote, which was expected to take place at the agency's June meeting, has been put off until at least late summer, according to people with knowledge of the agency's plans.
 The Federal Reserve's review started in early November, when senior officials informed the chiefs of the major banks and their compensation committees that they might need to change their pay practices ahead of new rules. The banks were required to respond to a four-page questionnaire, inquiring about policies like the golden parachute payouts for senior executives and the pay scales of lower-level mortgage bankers.
 The Fed, just as it did with the bank stress tests in the spring of 2009, analyzed thousands of pages of answers it received to compare the results and identify patterns.

HEADLINE: OTARIAN

BYLINE: By OLIVER STRAND

 BODY:
947 Eighth Avenue (West 56th Street), Midtown, (212) 489-3270; 154 Bleecker Street (Thompson Street), Greenwich Village, (212) 614-6834, otarian.com. 
 With sleight of hand, Otarian -- the high-concept, low-carbon-emission vegetarian fast-food restaurant that recently opened two branches in Manhattan -- serves airplane-quality food without the environmental guilt of flying.
 The tandoori mushroom paneer wrap ($7.25) is so thin and dry, it tastes like the midflight snack you find yourself eating against your better judgment because everybody else in economy is eating theirs, too.
 Still, it's good for the earth. At least that's how the packaging reads. The one for the wrap says it is ''made with sustainable and local ingredients that are never air-freighted and always minimise impact on the environment,'' and according to the menu it has a carbon footprint 0.91 kilograms smaller than that of a hypothetical chili burrito with beef.
 Everything at Otarian has an eco-narrative. (Even the name: an Otarian, according to the Australian company, is a global vegetarian.) There are ''carbon saving combo meals'' and every receipt has the motto ''Saving the Planet one Otarian meal at a time.'' There are flat-screen TVs showing cartoons that make a case for eating less meat: ashen figures representing the world's hungry look sad; adorable cows headed for a busy slaughterhouse look alarmed.
 Does that mean we need to suffer through the dense veggie patty of the Tex Mex ''burger'' ($7.95)? Even the listless spinach and potato tart ($7.45) is a punishment, the crust turned limp by a warming drawer. And if the apple and parsnip soup ($5.45 for a small) is flavorful and satisfying, the clumpy red curry noodles ($8.95) will put an end to that.
 This is focus-group food, where flavor isn't nearly as important as the idea. What a shame to hire a staff that's as warm, professional and attentive as you'll find in New York, and make them serve such joyless fare. It's not their fault. Neither is the sanctimony.
 Campaign slogans aren't allowed within 100 feet of a polling place. Maybe the city should extend the law to restaurants.

HEADLINE: Turkey, Long a Pliable Ally for the United States, Displays a New Assertiveness

BYLINE: By SABRINA TAVERNISE and MICHAEL SLACKMAN; Sabrina Tavernise reported from Ankara, and Michael Slackman from Cairo.

 BODY:
ANKARA, Turkey -- For decades, Turkey was one of the United States' most pliable allies, a strategic border state on the edge of the Middle East that reliably followed American policy. But recently, it has asserted a new approach in the region, its words and methods as likely to provoke Washington as to advance its own interests.
 The change in Turkey's policy burst into public view last week, after the deadly Israeli commando raid on a Turkish flotilla, which nearly severed relations with Israel, Turkey's longtime ally. Just a month ago, Turkey infuriated the United States when it announced that along with Brazil, it had struck a deal with Iran to ease a nuclear standoff, and on Tuesday it warmly welcomed Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, and the Russian prime minister, Vladimir V. Putin, at a regional security summit meeting in Istanbul.
 Turkey's shifting foreign policy is making its prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a hero to the Arab world, and is openly challenging the way the United States manages its two most pressing issues in the region, Iran's nuclear program and the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. 
 Turkey is seen increasingly in Washington as ''running around the region doing things that are at cross-purposes to what the big powers in the region want,'' said Steven A. Cook, a scholar with the Council on Foreign Relations. The question being asked, he said, is ''How do we keep the Turks in their lane?''
 From Turkey's perspective, however, it is simply finding its footing in its own backyard, a troubled region that has been in turmoil for years, in part as a result of American policy making. Turkey has also been frustrated in its longstanding desire to join the European Union.
 ''The Americans, no matter what they say, cannot get used to a new world where regional powers want to have a say in regional and global politics,'' said Soli Ozel, a professor of international relations at Bilgi University in Istanbul. ''This is our neighborhood, and we don't want trouble. The Americans create havoc, and we are left holding the bag.''
 Turkey's rise as a regional power may seem sudden, but it has been evolving for years, since the end of the cold war, when the world was a simple alignment of black and white and Turkey, a Muslim democracy founded in 1923, was a junior partner in the American camp.
 Twenty years later, the map has been redrawn. Turkey is now a vibrant, competitive democracy with an economy that would rank as the sixth largest in Europe. Unlike Jordan and Egypt, which rely heavily on American aid, it is financially independent of the United States. And, paradoxically, its democracy has created some problems with Washington: Members of Mr. Erdogan's own party defected in 2003, for example, voting not to allow the Americans to attack Iraq from Turkish territory.
 Ahmet Davutoglu, Turkey's foreign minister, said in an interview that economics was at the heart of the new policy. The party he belongs to, led by Mr. Erdogan, is made up of merchants and traders, who are more devoted to their business interests than to advancing Islamic solidarity.
 ''Economic interdependence is the best way to achieve peace,'' he said at his home in Ankara last weekend. ''In the 1990s we had severe tension all around us, and Turkey paid a huge bill because of that. Now we want to establish a peaceful order around us.''
 But that vision has led to friction with Washington, particularly over Iran, Turkey's only alternative energy source after Russia.
 ''They are ambitious, and this gives them a major role on the world stage,'' said a senior American official. ''But there is a risk that Americans won't understand what Turkey is doing, and that will have consequences for the relationship.''
 It is Mr. Erdogan's confrontation with Israel, which he accused of ''state terrorism'' in the flotilla raid, that raised the loudest alarms for Americans. Many see his fiery statements as a sign that he has not only abandoned the quest to join the European Union, but is aligning himself with Islamic rivals of the West.
 Yet, for years Mr. Erdogan encouraged closer ties with Israel, even taking a planeload of businessmen to Tel Aviv in 2005. While the relationship has deteriorated badly in recent years -- with Mr. Erdogan lambasting Shimon Peres, the Israeli president, over the Israeli military's tactics in the Gaza campaign -- Jewish leaders in Istanbul say that it is more about Mr. Erdogan's dislike of the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu than his view of Israel.
 ''The Jewish community in Turkey is not at all alarmed,'' said Ishak Alaton, a prominent Jewish businessman in Istanbul. The tough talk, he said, is simply Mr. Erdogan's style, an attempt to score points ahead of an election.
 Mr. Erdogan, though a pragmatist, is also a devout Muslim, a category that was once the underdog in secular Turkish society, and sympathy for the Palestinians is ingrained. He is hotheaded, with a street fighter's swagger that becomes more pronounced in crises. He took personal offense, for example, when Ehud Olmert, then Israel's prime minister, began without warning the bombing of Gaza while Mr. Erdogan was mediating talks between Israel and Syria.
 Shafeeq Ghabra, a political science professor at Kuwait University, argued that Turkey had stepped into a vacuum left by a failed peace process, and that it was trying to ''save the Palestinians from becoming desperate again and save Israel from itself.''
 That may be so, but Mr. Erdogan's tough talk eliminates Turkey's place at the table as a moderator with Israel, analysts said, and also boxes in the Obama administration, forcing it into a choice between allies that the Turks are sure to lose.
 Behind the friction between the United States and Turkey is a larger question about how to approach crises in the Middle East, argues Stephen Kinzer, author of the book ''Reset: Iran, Turkey and America's Future.'' Turkey calls for talks, while Washington seeks sanctions. ''Turks are telling the U.S.: 'The cold war's over. You have to take a more cooperative approach, and we can help,' '' said Mr. Kinzer, a former New York Times correspondent. ''The U.S. is not prepared to accept that offer.''
 Turkish and American officials play down their differences, saying they share the goal of peace in the Middle East. But certain viewpoints -- on Hamas and Israel's security concerns -- do seem to be throwing up insurmountable obstacles, and some see the Turkish stance as ignoring the realities.
 ''The world hasn't changed in 48 hours just because a boat was raided,'' said Asli Aydintasbas, a columnist for the Turkish daily Milliyet. ''Ankara thinks it is remaking the world, but in the long run this could backfire.''

HEADLINE: World Cup Is Not Just A Game, It's A Promotion

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER

 BODY:
LONDON -- European retailers are betting on the soccer World Cup to help increase sales by promising cash for goals.
 Depending on which national team wins the World Cup, which starts Friday in South Africa, some retailers have offered to repay customers for purchased television sets, cars, road navigation systems and vacation trips. Nationwide, a British bank, is even offering higher interest rates on a bond if England wins the tournament.
 ''It's a fun way to link our products to something rather topical,'' said Anthony Hua, a spokesman for Nationwide, which is the sponsor of the England team. 
 The four-year ''Football Bond'' pays a fixed rate of 4.15 percent a year, but 4.65 percent if England wins the World Cup, the company said. Mr. Hua said there was no time limit for the bond's availability so far, but ''if England gets kicked out of the tournament it may not be available anymore.''
 In France, the retailer Carrefour has offered to refund the cost of some flat-screen televisions if the national team wins. Toshiba has hired the retired British soccer player Chris Kamara to advertise the same offer for televisions and laptops in Britain, and Media Markt in Spain had a similar promotion, telling customers ''if Spain wins everything, you win everything.''
 TomTom, the maker of road navigation systems that is based in the Netherlands, is promising to refund money to customers on specific purchases in nine countries, including Germany, Mexico and Spain, if their respective team wins. 
 Most promotions end before the tournament starts and many companies hedged their risk. Rod O'Callaghan, a director at Airton Risk Management in Ireland who helps clients hedge more than 2 billion euros ($2.38 billion) in risk related to sports events each year, said demand for his service was ''very, very strong.''
 ''Many people want to surf the wave of the popularity of the event, sell more products, boost the brand and get more footfall in their stores and online,'' Mr. O'Callaghan said. Airton charges a fee to insure companies against the amount they will have to pay their customers if a specific team wins.
 Spain is seen as the team most likely to win the tournament by customers of the British sports betting firm William Hill. It leads the odds with 4 to 1, followed by Brazil with 9 to 2 and Argentina with 13 to 2. The odds for France are 20 to 1 and for the United States, 80 to 1, according to William Hill.
 Slovenia, with odds of 400 to 1, is using the World Cup to lure visitors. Its tourist board joined with some British tour operators to offer 25 percent, 50 percent or 100 percent refunds to anyone booking a trip depending on how far the Slovenian team advances in the tournament. 
 In Germany, Mercedes-Benz promises customers agreeing to a car lease a discount if Germany wins the World Cup.
 ''Our team gives us a title and we give you a rate,'' the company's Web site said. Currys, the British retailer, offered to pay $:10 ($14) for every goal England scores to any customer who spent $:599 or more on a television. England scored six goals during the last World Cup in 2006. 
 Promotions linked to sporting events are not new. In 2007, Jordan's Furniture, which is located in New England, had to repay about 30,000 customers for furniture they bought worth millions of dollars. Jordan, owned by Warren E. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, had offered clients their money back if the Boston Red Sox won the World Series, which they did. 
 In Britain, Anina Castle, a spokeswoman for Currys, said, ''Any World Cup is always as big as Christmas for us in terms of business and we wanted to stand out from the crowd and make it more fun this year. Our offer has been hugely popular.''

HEADLINE: Beneath Budget Noise in New Jersey, Some Consensus

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
TRENTON -- As lawmakers here try to hammer out the toughest state budget in decades, it has seemed a clash between political visions, pitting an unfeeling, program-slashing Republican governor against unthinking, tax-and-spend Democratic legislators.
 At least, that is how it can sound among the combatants, those in government and the interest groups trying to sway them with the June 30 budget deadline nearing. But much of the noise is about things that are not, strictly speaking, part of the state budget -- like Gov. Christopher J. Christie's urging voters to reject local school budgets in elections in April and his proposed constitutional amendment to cap property tax increases. 
 Listen closely to the actual budget debate, and there is widespread agreement that New Jersey's finances are in stunningly bad shape -- even by current woeful national standards -- making the deepest cuts in memory inevitable no matter who is in charge.
 In his first months in office, Mr. Christie has proposed a $29.3 billion budget, the smallest in five years, closing a projected $11 billion deficit with hits to municipalities, schools, mass transit, property tax rebates, tax credits for the poor, tuition aid to students and many other areas. The Democrats who control both houses of the Legislature have cried foul about some specifics but have been fairly quiet about the broad contours.
 ''A lot of what he's cutting, it had to happen,'' acknowledged Stephen M. Sweeney, a Gloucester County Democrat who is president of the State Senate. ''The state's out of whack. Everyone can see that.''
 Despite talk early this year of a showdown, Mr. Christie and legislative leaders now call it unlikely that a stalemate will leave the state without a budget at the deadline and force a government shutdown.
 Sheila Y. Oliver, the Assembly speaker, said that another governor might have chosen different cuts and some tax increases, but that ''even a Democratic governor would have had to make major cuts, one way or another.''
 In fact, a Democratic governor did: Jon S. Corzine, who lost his re-election fight last year to Mr. Christie, made the state budget smaller each of the last two years, cutting billions in spending as the recession took hold. Yet the state's fiscal condition kept deteriorating, battered by a steep downturn, a heavy reliance on the financial sector and decades of unsound policy choices.
 After Mr. Christie took office, he and the Legislature had to close a gap of more than $2 billion just to make it through the rest of the fiscal year. And state officials recently said that revenues were coming in lower than anticipated, worsening the problem.
 At a time when many, if not most, states face their gravest budget crises since the Depression, New Jersey has the third-biggest deficit, as a percentage of revenue, trailing Illinois and Nevada, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. In raw dollars, the $11 billion deficit in New Jersey for the next fiscal year is the second largest, behind California -- and larger than the $9 billion gap facing New York, a much bigger state that is rarely held up as a paragon of sound budgeting.
 New Jersey is also among the heaviest borrowers, and one of the worst performers in setting aside money to meet pension and retiree health obligations -- failings that could make budgeting more painful for decades.
 ''New Jersey has, unfortunately, a long history of pretty bad decisions by people in both parties, so even without this recession, there would be no easy, painless way of addressing it, no matter who the governor was,'' said David L. Crawford, an economist and a consultant. 
 The primary budget clash has been over whether to resurrect the so-called millionaire's tax on the highest incomes, enacted under Mr. Corzine, which expired last year. 
 The Legislature recently passed the tax, but even many Democrats were not enthusiastic about it, watching the governor brand them as people who ''believe in bigger government, higher taxes and more spending.'' Some lawmakers said that by making the tax a standalone bill that the governor could veto, which he did, they were tacitly conceding that it was more of a statement than something they intended to fight for.
 Mr. Christie has proposed cutting state aid to school districts, which his critics said would force districts to raise property taxes and lay off teachers. The governor got into a heated exchange with the teachers' unions that went far beyond the state budget, accusing teachers of politicizing classrooms, demanding that they accept a pay freeze and contribute part of their salaries to cover health benefits, and urging voters to reject local school budgets.
 Ben Dworkin, director of the Rebovich Institute for New Jersey Politics at Rider University, predicted that the enacted state budget would contain nearly everything Mr. Christie sought, with legislators of both parties voting for it and letting the governor take the heat if the cuts proved unpopular.
 ''He's made it into a fight with public employee unions rather than a fight about how to fund the schools, and a fight over restraining wasteful local government rather than the state budget,'' Mr. Dworkin said. ''It's been smart politics.''
 Mr. Christie, for his part, was optimistic during a recent radio call-in show. ''I think we're in a very good position to get it done by June 30, if not earlier,'' he said. ''We're going to have a budget that's very close to the one I submitted.''

HEADLINE: Outlook Improves for Game Maker Take-Two

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -- Take-Two Interactive on Tuesday raised its outlook for the fiscal year on strong demand for its Red Dead Redemption video game, sending shares up more than 2 percent. 
 Take-Two said the game, which hit stores in May, has sold more than five million units so far.
 As a result, the company, which has been hampered by cost overruns and game delays, raised its outlook for the 2010 fiscal year. It now expects a loss, excluding items, of 10 to 30 cents a share on revenue of $880 million to $980 million.
 Wall Street had been forecasting a loss of 38 cents a share on revenue of $914 million for the year.
 The company previously expected a loss of 40 to 60 cents a share on revenue of $725 million to $925 million.
 The chairman of Take-Two, Strauss Zelnick, said that he remained cautious about the economy and that the company continued to take a conservative approach to its outlook. But he said Take-Two's performance was improving.
 ''We're doing a better job in efficiency and execution,'' he said in an interview.
 The video game industry is still confronting a troubled economy. Video game software sales in the United States -- the world's biggest market -- sank 22 percent in April, according to the industry tracker NPD. Software sales are down 8 percent for the year.
 Take-Two also reported its fiscal second-quarter results on Tuesday, posting a net profit of $16.8 million, or 20 cents a share, compared with a net loss of $10.1 million, or 13 cents a share, in the period a year earlier.
 Excluding one-time items, the company earned 34 cents a share, ahead of the average analyst estimate of 26 cents. Revenue rose more than 50 percent, to $268 million.
 Sales in the quarter were led by BioShock 2 and strong demand for older games.
 Take-Two is best known for its Grand Theft Auto franchise, one of the top sellers of all time. 
 For the current quarter, Take-Two forecast a loss, excluding items, of 10 to 20 cents a share on revenue of $250 million to $300 million. That compares with the consensus estimate for a loss of 39 cents a share on revenue of $169 million.

Swiss lawmakers on Tuesday rejected a deal to hand over to United States authorities data on more than 4,000 wealthy Americans suspected of evading taxes with the help of the Swiss bank UBS, a move that could bring the bank a step closer to indictment, according to people briefed on the matter.
 The rejection, by the lower house of the Swiss Parliament, is the latest stumbling block to a deal reached last August with the Justice Department that requires the Swiss government to turn over the names as part of a continuing criminal investigation into UBS for selling offshore tax evasion services through its private bank. 
 A continued refusal to provide the names, if not reversed by the end of next week, when the Swiss Parliament adjourns until mid-September, would set into motion events that could lead the Justice Department to indict the bank, according to people briefed on the matter but not authorized to speak about it publicly. 
 But several steps would have to be taken before that drastic move, which would be a near-certain corporate death knell for UBS in the United States.
 Swiss lawmakers in the lower house, the National Council, rejected the deal by a vote of 104 to 76, with 16 abstentions. They also voted to send the measure to a national referendum, if necessary. The upper house, the Council of States, approved the deal last week. Both sides will begin on Wednesday to try to reach a compromise.
 ''It would be in the interest of the Swiss economy if we left this unfortunate chapter behind us,'' Justice Minister Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf said before the vote, according to Bloomberg News.
 If the entire Swiss Parliament does not approve the deal by June 18, the Justice Department, on behalf of the Internal Revenue Service, will revive a legal case against UBS in a Florida court that seeks to force the bank to turn over 52,000 names of American clients, a person briefed on the matter said. The Justice Department dropped the civil lawsuit, known as a John Doe summons, when Switzerland agreed last August to turn over 4,450 names. 
 It is not clear whether the judge in the civil case, Alan S. Gold of the United States District Court in Miami, would rule in favor of the United States authorities or UBS. 
 But if UBS refuses to comply with a future order by Judge Gold to turn over the 52,000 names, the judge could impose a fine on the bank, possibly in the millions or tens of millions of dollars for each day of refusal, said Scott D. Michel, a lawyer at Caplin & Drysdale, a law firm in Washington, who has represented former UBS clients. UBS could try to avoid complying with such an order, he said, by citing confidentiality laws.
 UBS has argued that it could not turn over the 52,000 names because doing so would violate Swiss bank secrecy laws. Swiss lawmakers opposed to the deal for the 4,450 names have adopted the same position, with some saying they will approve a handover only if a separate tax on banker bonuses is included in the measure.
 The civil lawsuit, an outgrowth of the criminal investigation into UBS, was brought by the Justice Department in February 2009, a day after the bank agreed to pay $780 million and admit to criminal wrongdoing with its private bank. That deal allowed UBS to avoid indictment and instead enter into a deferred-prosecution agreement with the Justice Department. 
 In the wake of the parliamentary rejection, prosecutors are considering whether to extend the deferred-prosecution agreement in six-month increments after it expires in August. If the bank has not turned over the 4,450 names after one or more extensions, or if it defies any future ruling on the 52,000 names in the separate civil case, prosecutors are ready to consider indicting the bank, according to persons briefed on the matter. 
 Under the unusual terms of the deferred-prosecution agreement, prosecutors must receive permission from the Federal Reserve to indict the bank. 
 Switzerland has argued that indicting UBS could roil the global economy, after the bailout on Wall Street and turmoil on Europe. 
 In a statement on Tuesday, the I.R.S. said that ''we expect that the Swiss government will continue to honor the terms of the agreement'' for the 4,450 names.
 ''We continue to monitor the events in Switzerland, and we stand ready to pursue all legal options available to us should the Swiss fail to provide the required information,'' the statement said.
 Karina Byrne, a spokeswoman for UBS, said that the bank had noted the parliamentary vote, but declined to comment further. Charles Miller, a Justice Department spokesman, declined to comment.
 The showdown over UBS, which once centered on wealthy client gatherings in Miami and Geneva, has highlighted a cultural difference between the two countries: unlike the United States, Switzerland does not view tax evasion as a crime.
 The case gained ground in recent years when Bradley C. Birkenfeld, a former UBS private banker, spilled secrets to prosecutors and described tax-evasion planning that included some of the highest executives of the bank. Mr. Birkenfeld, an American who is serving a 40-month prison sentence in the United States, is the only UBS banker or executive to go to jail, a fact that has infuriated his lawyers.
 Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, sent a letter on Tuesday to the I.R.S. and Treasury Department asking them to provide details of how they had used Mr. Birkenfeld's information.

HEADLINE: Whither Wall Street? Pick Your Indicator

BYLINE: By GRAHAM BOWLEY; Christine Hauser contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Everyone on Wall Street watches the Dow. Guy LeBas watches the Cow.
 To be precise, he watches Bessie -- the nickname of an obscure market barometer devised by Janney Montgomery Scott, an old-line brokerage firm in Philadelphia, to measure the anxiety inside the world's credit markets. Officially, Bessie is the Credit Availability Oscillator, or CAO -- pronounced ''cow,'' hence the playful moniker. 
 Like his counterparts from New York to London, Mr. LeBas, Janney's chief fixed-income strategist, is digging ever deeper for clues about the markets and economy. The financial world has turned so volatile lately, and its story moves so fast, that bankers, money managers and analysts are latching onto a variety of market indicators in an effort to see what's ahead. 
 Indicators are being continually parsed and picked over, like the prices of lumber and palladium, as well as an alphabet soup of indexes, interest rates, spreads and swaps. The big question on everyone's mind is whether the financial troubles in Europe will worsen -- and what that would mean for the United States. The stock market's recent dive only added to fears that this crisis will reach across the Atlantic.
 ''What you are really looking for is a canary in a coal mine,'' said Douglas S. Roberts, chief investment strategist for the Channel Capital Research Institute. 
 The canaries that the pros are listening to are rarely heard outside financial circles. But then, it wasn't long ago that the same could be said for collateralized debt obligations, or C.D.O.'s. As events unfold, new terms -- Libor, VIX, the Ifo index, the Baltic Dry Index -- may well join the lexicon of the Great Recession. 
 Perhaps no other banking statistic is being watched as closely as Libor -- the London interbank offered rate. It is a measure, calculated by the British Bankers' Association, of the rates at which banks borrow money from other banks in the London wholesale money market. 
 In the dark days after Lehman Brothers collapsed, the three-month Libor spiked to more than 5 percent. Today, it is about 0.5 percent. But for months now, the Libor has been creeping upward. It is already double what it was at the start of the year -- a sign, economists say, that banks are reluctant to lend money to one another. 
 The Libor-Overnight Indexed Swaps spread, another bellwether, measures the difference between the Libor and the rate that banks pay to borrow money in the swaps market. It, too, has been rising. 
 Skeptics say the Libor provides a skewed look at the borrowing costs of banks because the rate is set largely by European banks. Some analysts instead track the vast market for corporate i.o.u.'s, or commercial paper. 
 The chief financial officer of one American bank, who did not want to be named, has a computer ''dashboard'' tracking Libor, Libor-O.I.S. and a host of other market variables, including the Baltic Dry Index, which tracks worldwide shipping rates and, the thinking goes, is therefore a good gauge of economic activity. 
 Which of these indicators is most important?
 ''The answer changes over time as the underlying conditions change,'' said Mohamed El-Erian, chief executive of the bond giant Pimco. ''Right now, we are paying a lot of attention to indicators of the health of the interbank market in Europe.''
 In the credit markets, the focus is on distinguishing between Europe's weak and strong. The premium to German government bonds -- Europe's equivalent of ultra-safe United States Treasury securities -- that bond investors demand on Greek, Portuguese and Spanish debt has been watched closely for months now. Indeed, even ordinary Greeks are known to ask, ''where's the spread?'' when the markets turn turbulent. 
 Last week, the premium, or spread, on Spanish debt rose to the highest level since the mid-1990s.
 When that happens, investors start to get nervous that the borrowing costs of governments will jump, creating a vicious circle ending in some countries being unable to pay their debts. 
 ''The thing we want is a sense that government yields are not rising in some kind of nefarious way,'' said Jeffrey Palma, head of global equity strategy at UBS Investment Bank.
 Traders are also keenly watching the credit-default swap market for European debt, a mechanism for investors to buy insurance against the risk of default on bonds. One of the most-watched measures is the Markit iTraxx SovX index, which tracks C.D.S. spreads on sovereign debt. It rose sharply this year, fell back once European governments promised a $1 trillion aid package, but then recently returned to its peak of earlier this year.
 ''It is clearly flashing now,'' said Zach Pandl, an economist at Nomura Securities in New York.
 With the renewed volatility in the markets -- including the May 6 flash crash -- has come fresh interest in the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index. The VIX, as it is known, measures the implied volatility of options on the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. On Friday, it ticked up again, close to its highest level since early last year. 
 And then there is Bessie. Janney Montgomery Scott compiles the oscillator from all sorts of things -- mortgage rates, auto loan rates, loan survey data from the Federal Reserve and buy and sell messages that its traders receive via their Bloomberg terminals. It uses Bessie internally and makes it available to its clients.
 The idea of Bessie is to determine how difficult it is for consumers to get credit. Lending conditions are a central driver of consumer spending, and thus economic growth. 
 Bessie dipped into deep negative territory in 2008 and early 2009, but then it bounced back later in 2009. Worryingly, though, Bessie has started to move down again lately, Mr. LeBas said. After plunging to a reading of minus 90 in the fourth quarter of 2008, it stood at around 13 earlier this year, but is currently at around 3. 
 ''The last time there was a negative move of this magnitude was in the fourth quarter of 2008,'' Mr. LeBas said. That was just before the initial optimism over the federal rescue of the nation's banking system faded -- and the Dow began to slide. 

GRAPHIC: CHARTS: Though nowhere near the peak during the height of the financial crisis, the spread between the three-month London interbank offered rate and the rate on overnight indexed swaps -- the rate that banks pay to borrow in the swaps market -- has been rising, indicating that banks are becoming more reluctant to lend to each other.

HEADLINE: Tomlinson Relishes New Home, And New Opportunity, With Jets

BYLINE: By GREG BISHOP

 BODY:
BASKING RIDGE, N.J. -- LaDainian Tomlinson counted down his final days in San Diego: three nights left in the house he built, two meals remaining at his favorite restaurant, one last goodbye to the city that embraced him.
 He reminisced with the grandmothers who approached him at the Jack in the Box drive-through. He sat with friends in his favorite room -- nicknamed the man dungeon by his wife -- their words echoing into empty space.
 On the final March morning, he boarded an airplane and surveyed the city after takeoff. His home for the last nine seasons, the place where Tomlinson compiled Hall of Fame statistics, grew smaller by the second.
 He kept returning to the same thought: my work here is done. 
 He is now fully engaged with the Jets as they begin preparations for a new season. Last month, Tomlinson sat inside the Vine restaurant, around the corner from his New Jersey residence, emphasis on new, a short drive from the gleaming headquarters of his new team. He repeatedly used variations of the same word -- comfort, comfortable, comforting -- which seemed odd, given the doubts to overcome and the transition that awaits.
 Released by the Chargers in February, signed by the Jets in March, Tomlinson is the latest 30-year-old running back cast briefly into unemployment. But although he turns 31 on June 23, he thinks that where and how he found work speaks to forces greater than simple N.F.L. economics.
 ''I'm a spiritual person,'' he said. ''I'm looking for the storybook ending: the kid from a town in Texas with one street goes to the Big Apple and delivers a Super Bowl. I really believe that's my story, that's what's supposed to happen. That's my destiny.''
 Ollie Wilson, the Chargers' running backs coach, picked up Tomlinson at the San Diego airport before his rookie season. On the drive in, Tomlinson said Wilson told him the city was starving for a superstar.
 From 2001 on, Tomlinson fed that hunger. He became a local icon, perhaps the athlete most synonymous with San Diego, or at least approaching the level of Tony Gwynn, the baseball star. Signs read ''L. T. for Mayor'' in the stands. The Chargers hung his picture, eight feet long, larger than life, inside their headquarters.
 Tomlinson also worked tirelessly in the community, capturing the N.F.L.'s man of the year and Most Valuable Player awards in 2006. His foundation's first Thanksgiving drive fed 250 people; his last fed more than 2,100, with radio and television stations lining a local parking lot.
 ''You had people crying,'' said Mark Amado, an adviser and close friend. ''Some hadn't had turkey in three or four years.''
 Tomlinson hoped to retire wearing lightning bolts, and for years, it seemed as if he would. He led the league in rushing for a second straight season in 2007 despite severe turf toe. But even then, he said he heard whispers about his impending decline.
 In Norv Turner's second year as coach (2008), Tomlinson could sense the end draw closer. He had watched the franchise jettison Drew Brees, Junior Seau and Rodney Harrison, and that season, Tomlinson sensed a shift in offensive philosophy, away from the ground game, away, essentially, from him.
 Combine that with a series of injuries -- turf toe, high-ankle sprain, sprained medial collateral ligament, among others -- and Tomlinson said he entered last season certain it was his final campaign in San Diego.
 ''If I'm healthy and given the opportunity, I can still perform at a high level,'' he said. ''Last year, I wasn't healthy, and I wasn't given the opportunity. I'm not bitter. Facts are facts. That's what happened.''
 Tomlinson managed 12 touchdowns last season but posted career lows in rushing yards (730) and average yards per carry (3.3).
 He insisted his comments last month about the Chargers' shifting offensive philosophy were misinterpreted, but they rubbed former teammates the wrong way, and Tomlinson said he reached out to some to clarify. He also exchanged cross-country barbs with General Manager A. J. Smith, of whom he says, ''We never really had a relationship.''
 The Jets showed Tomlinson the love he once felt in San Diego. The owner Woody Johnson called and insisted that Tomlinson call him Woody. On Tomlinson's visit, the Jets left a gift basket at the entrance to his villa, filled with the baby bottles and baby outfits that instantly sold his wife, LaTorsha.
 The most important pitch, though, came from quarterback Mark Sanchez, who dropped off a gift -- Tomlinson described it as a ''crystal, with a Jets helmet that lights up from the bottom'' -- hours before Tomlinson's departure, at 7 a.m.
 That said something, about an organization that Tomlinson found more like a family than the Chargers, about a young quarterback who seemed mature beyond his years. Tomlinson came for many reasons -- including his familiarity with the offensive coordinator, Brian Schottenheimer, and his fondness for Coach Rex Ryan -- but Sanchez sealed it.
 ''He sold me,'' Tomlinson said. ''I already felt an instant connection. I felt like, if the quarterback of the team is this way, there's going to be a lot of guys just like him.''
 Tomlinson returned recently to San Diego but did not check on his house, which is on the market. Amado said that reflected Tomlinson's mind-set: moving forward.
 For all the wooing, Tomlinson arrived in New Jersey to little fanfare, certainly nothing close to the reception received two years ago by quarterback Brett Favre. The Jets did not hold an introductory news conference, indicative of Tomlinson's new standing.
 Instead, he settled into a familiar but distant role, that of underdog, as when he signed with Texas Christian as an unheralded recruit, or when he arrived in San Diego with the woeful Chargers. His voice rises, though, when detailing an ESPN commentator's recent assertion that Tomlinson's career was nearing a sad, steep decline, similar to Shaun Alexander's eventual departure from Seattle.
 ''It ticked me off,'' Tomlinson said. ''Because I don't believe that. That's not my destination, to end like that. That might have been fine with Shaun, but that's not fine for me. I won't accept that.''
 He paused, smiled, then added, ''I guess I need a cane now.''
 That is where Tomlinson finds himself this season, a proud athlete, elite even among elite, fighting to prolong his career. He said he stopped lifting weights as fervently the past three years, and to that end, he resumed college-style training this off-season.
 Each week, Tomlinson worked out twice daily, four times a week, reserving a fifth day for massages and stretching (worth repeating: during his off-season). He squatted 600 pounds recently for the first time since college, hoping to overcome what he has lost in speed with brute force.
 ''The change has motivated him,'' Schottenheimer said. ''You can see it out at practice. And when we turn on the film, we still see a heck of a football player.''
 Michael Jordan once told Tomlinson he thought he would play forever, and Tomlinson knew right then, special athlete to special athlete, that Jordan meant every word. But for all athletes, even special ones, retirement is inevitable.
 Tomlinson knows that time is passing, even if he vehemently disagrees with the notion that his time has passed. In these Jets, he sees a team built to contend for the championship he never delivered to San Diego, his only regret.
 LaTorsha is eight months pregnant with their first child (they had another child die about six months into the pregnancy in 2005). The couple stayed overnight for the first time in their new home last month. Tomlinson even found a new man dungeon, where each night, he performs his ''fire gazing'' ritual, borrowing from ancient cavemen, taking 20 minutes to decompress, staring into the fireplace.
 Thus Tomlinson embarks on his second act, comforted by his new team, comfortable in his new home, comforting his pregnant wife. Comfort all around.
 ''I've found the perfect opportunity, the perfect place,'' he said. ''Because winning a championship here will solidify who I am, as an athlete, as a person, as, you know, everything.''

HEADLINE: Wisecracks and Pasta, One More Time

BYLINE: By N. R. KLEINFIELD

 BODY:
The moment they spied one another, the needling began, the way it always did.
 Lefty Weiss said, ''Frank Levy can't remember anything but his last name.''
 Mr. Levy said, ''Lefty, will you shut up?''
 Dick Zimmern said, ''Hey, there's Lew Nick. Is he sane?''
 Mr. Weiss (his real first name: Neil) allowed how ''Lew and Red Rose came all the way from California for a cheap meal.''
 ''What do you mean, cheap?'' Mr. Nick retorted. ''I thought it was free.'' 
 The back and forth, well, it was never going to stop until they did. It had been going on for more than 70 years.
 The men who befriended one another when they were boys were back being boys -- maybe for the last time. Mortality was pressing on their heels. They were in their mid-80s. Half of them had already gone to wherever one finishes up.
 Such was the Century Athletic Club, winding down.
 In 1937, 18 boys who lived mainly in the 80s on the Upper West Side of Manhattan formed a sports and fraternal club. They played roller hockey between sewer covers, stickball, baseball in the park -- if need be, getting into fistfights with rival clubs to claim a diamond. Schor's, a local candy store, was their improvised clubhouse.
 The years clicked by. Boys became men. All but one went off to fight World War II. One didn't come back. Careers replaced carousing. Still, they remained friends, a lifelong affection for one another somehow inscribed in their DNA. Every so often, they demonstrated their unflinching fidelity by gathering for a reunion dinner. This paper chronicled their 60th reunion in 1997, when 11 of them were left.
 Now there were nine. Some were in poor health. Even the reasonably springy ones had to acknowledge they were tapping on heaven's gates. They wanted to taste one more reunion, knowing it could be the final one. As Frank Levy, who used to be in the textile business, put it: ''This may be our last hurrah. How many more of these can we survive? If we have another one, it'll be with our attendants.''
 So the other evening they assembled to reminisce and taunt one another at Montebello's Italian restaurant on East 56th Street. Some brought wives and children, siblings or significant others. Everyone brought memories.
 Dick Zimmern and Bob Schwartz -- he's called Poopsie -- came up from Florida. Lefty Weiss flew in from St. Thomas. Lew Nick and Alfred Rose (that's Red Rose) arrived from California. Dick Felix and Marty Brustein came over from Long Island, while Frank Levy made it from Westchester County. Dick Golub, not feeling well, had to send his regrets.
 Charles Evans, who founded the Evan-Picone fashion house before becoming a real estate developer, would not be here, either. He died three years ago. Late in 2008, a heart attack took Gerald Schoenfeld, the head of the Shubert theater organization. 
 So just eight. For the first time, they were at single digits.
 Looking around wonderingly, the men were jubilant to see one another. Their eyes sparkled and blazed.
 They had all done well for themselves. Two still worked. Mr. Brustein was a stockbroker, which led Mr. Levy to blame the recession on him. Mr. Nick did consulting for a furniture company. He said he had been battling vertigo lately, which had caused him to cease playing golf but not to stop working.
 ''I'll work until they put me in a box,'' he said. 
 Mr. Weiss said he had ''retired for the fourth time'' in December, selling his interest in some shopping malls, and was going to take a three-month cruise to the Orient.
 They had their fun, spinning stories of mothballed days stored in their hearts.
 Mr. Nick mentioned how he and Dick Golub stole a stop sign one night. They had no particular need for a stop sign, but it occupied time. They stashed it in Mr. Nick's room for maybe six months, then dumped it on the street.
 Mr. Weiss had a file of pictures and articles from the war days. He had been shot down and imprisoned by the Germans for 17 months. After his plane crashed, he found himself lying on the ground, unable to move. He couldn't hear. He thought he was dead. He said he didn't know what dead felt like, but this sure didn't feel like living. 
 Mr. Levy had patched together a list of a couple of dozen girls from the old neighborhood. When he got everyone's attention, he rattled them off, pausing after each name for a show of hands from those who had dated her. Whoever attested to the heaviest volume, he said, would get a prize.
 He mentioned one name. No hands. He looked hard at Mr. Nick.
 ''You married her!'' he roared.
 ''Oh, yeah,'' Mr. Nick said, and stuck up his hand. 
 No one was bothering to keep count, so Mr. Levy went ahead and declared himself the winner. He had stepped out with four of them.
 And the prize?
 A second cup of coffee. 
 ''Hey, what do you expect?'' Mr. Levy said.
 Mr. Levy had brought his significant other and one of his daughters, Jodi Collins, to the event. She had once been married to a comedian who Mr. Levy said had never made him laugh once. Walking Ms. Collins down the aisle, he said he had whispered to her, ''Keep on walking.'' He said she told him, ''Shut up.''
 No women were allowed in the Century Athletic Club, but one got awfully close. She was known as the club sweetheart. 
 Susan Kahn Rosenkranz was now her name. She was here too. She had dated many of the club members. She nearly married several of them. 
 She had been engaged to Mr. Brustein. The week before the ceremony, he broke it off. He said he wasn't ready. He said she threw the ring at him.
 ''I did not,'' she said. ''I gave it to him.''
 ''Well, maybe,'' he said.
 Was she mad, hurt, bewildered? 
 ''No,'' she said. ''I didn't want to marry him, either.''
 So it went.
 Lew Nick peered around the room, his old friends digging into steak and red snapper. ''We're the only guys 10 years younger than Methuselah,'' he said. 
 He got quiet. ''If any of these guys called me and said they needed me, I'd get on the first plane,'' he said. ''Any of us would. I get emotional when I think of this. We lived a lot together. We like each other and we love each other.''
 They posed for a group picture, guzzled more booze. 
 As the clock ticked toward 11, the old bones were feeling the heavy wear of the years. The men who once were boys got their coats to go. Goodbyes and good wishes all around. Friends into eternity, and maybe this was it. They hoped to do it again in four years, when they would be 90, but who knew. 
 No tears here, though. Nearly three-quarters of a century relishing each other's company. The way they figured it, they had had a mighty good run.

 That is the blunt message for restless queues of hungry diners at a clutch of new restaurants in New York City, ranging from Ma Peche, David Chang's place in Midtown; to the Breslin, April Bloomfield's kitchen north of Madison Square Park; to Fatty 'Cue, Zak Pelaccio's restaurant in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.
 At these places and countless others that offer distinctive food amid not-always-shabby chic, the old reservation-book exclusivity has been replaced by an equally restrictive populist no-reservations scrim. 
 Some diners hear the message as inclusive. For others, it is infuriating, often to the point of their avoiding certain restaurants entirely. 
 ''To tell you the truth,'' said Mario Buatta, the Manhattan interior designer who has heard the buzz and read the reviews, ''I can't think of a place I would go that doesn't take reservations.''
 Certainly there have always been queuing spots, like Grimaldi's Pizzeria in Brooklyn and Roberto near Arthur Avenue in the Bronx, where diners patiently -- proudly? -- brave interminable lines. But the policy is increasingly common at many of the restaurants that critics and bloggers are most enthusiastic about, and that a certain breed of New Yorker feels the urge to visit before the next hot thing comes along.
 The Zagat Survey has taken note and is considering ''establishing this as a category,'' said Tim Zagat, the company's chief executive, referring to his back-of-the book special-feature listings. The topic of reservations is now ''a lively subject of comment among our contributors,'' he said of Zagat's citizen-reviewers, whose average age is in the 40s and whose average household income, he said, is $158,000.
 At Al di La in Park Slope, Brooklyn, ''the no-reservation policy is a buzz-kill,'' wrote one surveyor, who was anonymous thanks to the Zagat nondisclosure policy.
 Many restaurateurs, though, are delighted to do away with the formidable payroll expense and heartburn that come with reservations. Some point to Mr. Chang -- with his first-come, first-served Momofuku restaurants in the East Village -- as the trendsetter driving stakes through the hearts of reservationists.
 ''There is a little bit of something going on -- maybe 'democratic' is the wrong word, but it is the closest one,'' Mr. Chang said. ''By not taking reservations, there is a certain lack of pretension. It is saying that we just want people to eat something delicious. And that people aren't there for the scene -- or anything else but the food.''
 But now, at Ma Peche, he has beamed up to the Chambers Hotel, on West 56th Street.
 Mr. Chang ''is smart and runs a smart operation,'' said Ken Aretsky, the owner of the 120-seat Aretsky's Patroon in Midtown, ''but I just don't understand not taking reservations in a Midtown hotel.''
 Mr. Chang acknowledged that there was a chance the policy might fail. But, he said: ''We're not going to change that overnight. We'll tinker with it until we find the right formula.''
 Customers at Ma Peche have varying opinions about a reservation-less Midtown restaurant. ''It wouldn't be a deterrent to coming with friends or co-workers,'' said James Blank, a lawyer who was trying the shrimp spring rolls last week. ''But you can't have a client wait an hour for a table.''
 Others were willing to suspend judgment. ''It's not a typical businessman's lunch, and I'm not a typical businessman,'' said Leah Dickerman, a curator at the Museum of Modern Art, who was waiting in the bar for both a business guest and an available table. ''I think the food trumps the wait.''
 The rise of wait-your-turn dining ''may simply be a function of the down economy,'' said Rick Camac, a managing partner of the tiny Fatty Crab/Fatty 'Cue empire. The downturn ''has dictated more casual restaurants, where people are not looking for uptight service or high price points -- and often that means no reservations.''
 Around town, check averages have deflated. Generally, no-reservations customers are younger and less affluent, and, in part, the reservation question entails ''the suits versus the shorts issue,'' as Steven Hall, a restaurant publicist, put it. 
 Still, it is decidedly premature to claim some grand paradigm shift in reservations policy. For the most part, for waiting-in-line to work, ''you need a big place and a high-traffic neighborhood,'' said Ed Brown, the Ed of the 100-seat Ed's Chowder House on the Upper West Side.
 ''Or,'' he added, ''the restaurant can be so small -- 35 or 40 seats -- that it's always going to fill up. It all depends on your business model.''
 In recent lean years, those smaller spaces, with their proportionally lower rents, have appealed to chefs who want to go out on a limb without bringing the whole tree crashing down around them.
 Fatty Crab, on Hudson Street, the forerunner of Fatty 'Cue, hasn't taken reservations since it opened in 2005. ''With our low price point, that was a necessity to stay in business,'' Mr. Camac said. For restaurateurs, there is a side benefit, he said: ''The good news is that if they want to dine at 9, they show up at 8, and we know we'll have them for an hour of drinking at the bar.''
 But what plays downtown may not be a successful adaptation to other urban microclimates. Three miles north, the Upper West Side Fatty Crab, at Broadway near West 76th Street, has been taking reservations since its debut in March 2009. ''It's an older, less adventurous demographic, and it can also be stroller town,'' Mr. Camac said, referring to parents tethered to a ticking baby-sitter clock. ''Uptown, if they're told there will be a 20-minute wait, they are walking out the door.''
 Curiously, though, Celeste, a 45-seat Neapolitan restaurant not far away on Amsterdam Avenue near West 84th Street, takes no reservations and always has a line because, explained Carmine Mitroni, an owner, ''I am willing to limit my client base.''
 The color of the reservations universe is decidedly gray. Hundreds of restaurants take reservations only for groups of six or more. Others perform a never-ending do-si-do with their reservations policies.
 ''When we opened we took no reservations,'' said Frank Christopher, an owner of the 11-year-old Smoke Jazz and Supper Club on Broadway near 105th Street. But in the first year, lines became so unwieldy that it became a reservation house. ''If people are denied admission again and again, they just stop coming,'' he said.
 No-shows became such a problem in the 55-seat boite, though, that reservations were discontinued. Then four years ago, when Smoke started serving the food of the chef Patricia Williams, reservations were reinstated to foster kitchen planning.
 Buzzy O'Keeffe, who founded the 33-year-old River Cafe, said that ''it would be impossible for me to have a no-reservations policy,'' explaining, ''Richard Holbrooke, Joe Biden and Kofi Annan are not going to come to wait around and stand in line.''
 Operationally, ''to control the reservation book is to get the right mix in your restaurant -- it's like making a great stew,'' Mr. O'Keeffe said, adding that timing the tables adroitly can keep the kitchen from being slammed.
 Not too many years ago, it was not uncommon for aggressive diners to pretend that they were celebrities, to steal names from reservation books -- and to even steal the reservation books themselves -- in the quest for seats at high-value culinary targets. Some credit David Bouley with boosting the reservation science of that era to another level with his original Bouley restaurant in the 1990s. His fanatically assembled file-card dossier of diners served as a customer-loyalty builder and ''a great vehicle for more-knowledgeably serving customers,'' he said.
 His centrality to the cosmos of reservations became transcendent when ''Fully Committed,'' a wickedly hilarious Off Broadway hit in 2000, revealed the travails of a reservations clerk beset by pecking-order snobbery and chef megalomania. The play, by Becky Mode, originally starred the actor Mark Setlock; both were former Bouley reservationists. ''I think all of us there at the time were a bunch of maniacs,'' Mr. Bouley recalled fondly.
 And then? Five years ago, Mr. Bouley, the Mozart of reservations, decided that his 40-seat Bouley Upstairs would have a no-reservations policy. ''It took me a while to learn just how a no-reservation restaurant works,'' he said.
 The easy button for many restaurateurs is OpenTable.com, which allows diners to make reservations 24/7 online. ''The average restaurant spends $1,500 to $2,000 a month on OpenTable,'' said Mr. Brown, of Ed's Chowder House, adding that restaurants like his pay a setup fee, monthly fees and a fee for every reservation.
 In addition, a serious fine-dining experience requires reservationists ''12 hours a day, seven days a week,'' Mr. Brown said, ''a minimum of three people making $30,000 apiece per year plus benefits.''
 ''Add to that yearly payments of $20,000 in OpenTable fees,'' he said. ''So by having no reservations, that restaurant saves $125,000 a year.''
 Furthermore, while no-reservations restaurants can reach as many as four table turns a night, two may be the maximum for restaurants that take reservations, Mr. Brown said. ''So for them, often the only way to cope with increasing costs is to keep charging more money.'' That, in turn, can price a restaurant out of its market.
 Despite the lingering recession, most of the haute newcomers still take reservations. At Marea, Minetta Tavern and the Mark Restaurant by Jean-Georges, to name a few, scoring that desirable table can still present a preposterous degree of difficulty.
 Ironically, diners who do gain admission may feel as if they're back in the no-reservations wait-list vortex. ''Finally we got a reservation,'' Mr. Buatta, the interior designer, said of a recent meal at the Mark, ''but when we arrived, they made us wait for 25 minutes in the lobby. Then when we got up to the restaurant, there were so many empty tables it was not to be believed.'' 
 A spokeswoman said the restaurant tries to accommodate ''all customers' requests, but reservations are not a science, but an art.''
 And a rigid no-reservations policy can provoke ill-will chill, too. Serena Bargha, formerly a repeat customer at Prime Meats in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, tried to arrange a wedding-rehearsal dinner for 10 people recently only to succumb to the restaurant's no-reservations policy. ''Their food is fantastic, but their inability to take any reservations is absurd,'' she said. ''They just wouldn't work with us. I guess the restaurant is so popular they feel they can afford to ignore us. But now I'll never go back.''
 Frank Castronovo, an owner of the restaurant, said he regretted such rejections, but a reservations operation ''costs money, and most people prefer to pay 15 percent less,'' he said.
 If the price is right, customers can be fiercely resourceful in queue-beating. ''You get to know the restaurant, so you can time the lines,'' said Sergio Flores, a creative director in a Manhattan advertising agency who was noshing at the Hudson Street Fatty Crab on a recent evening.
 Michael Burkin, an Internet advertising executive who was waiting for a table there, said that ''die-hard New Yorkers have a 30-minute rule,'' explaining, ''after that, leave it to the tourists.''
 A no-reservations rule can also draw neighbors' ire. ''Places that have lines get Nimby complaints,'' Mr. Camac said. ''So we have a 'please be respectful of our neighbors' sign, and our managers are required to keep the noise level down.''
 Only a few restaurants are diminutive and exclusive enough to achieve freedom from all such quotidian concerns. At Rao's, the phenomenally reclusive restaurant at East 114th Street and Pleasant Avenue in East Harlem, the longtime gatekeeper and patriarch, Frank Pellegrino Sr., is feared as ''Frankie No'' for turning down desperate telephone pleas for entry.
 Mr. Pellegrino described a call he received from a supplicant who had explained that he was a childhood friend of the beloved parish priest who presided over the annual Giglio di Sant'Antonio festival on Pleasant Avenue. 
 Mr. Pellegrino patiently heard him out. Then he pronounced judgment into the phone: ''Good. But not good enough!'' and hung up.

HEADLINE: Even More Twists and Turns for Aspen Festival

BYLINE: By JAMES R. OESTREICH

 BODY:
When the corporation of the Aspen Music Festival and School in Colorado, made up mostly of the board of trustees and the faculty, rendered a vote of no confidence in the festival's president and chief executive, Alan Fletcher, in April, Rob LeBuhn, then the board chairman, said, ''We will only know what the practical effects are later.'' 
 Some of those effects became clearer on Monday, at a special meeting of the board. For one, Mr. LeBuhn was voted out after a year in office and immediately stepped down. For another, Mr. Fletcher had his contract extended for two years, through September 2012.
 It was merely the latest in a series of dizzying swings of fortune for Mr. Fletcher. He was fired by the executive committee of the board last October and rehired by the full board in November.
 ''I hope this is a climactic step,'' Mr. Fletcher said from Aspen on Tuesday. ''It seems to be one. The board has always supported me. It is a curiosity that we have two governing organs, the board and the corporation.''
 But the board has the power to hire and fire, and the corporation's April vote had no binding effect. ''It was a ceremonial vote,'' Mr. Fletcher said, ''not an active vote.''
 Still, it is clear that fault lines run deep at Aspen, one of the most important teaching festivals in the country, and Mr. Fletcher's main antagonists seem to be members of the faculty. Mr. Fletcher has dealt with the 61-year-old festival's specific needs, including serious maintenance problems on an aging campus, and the general economic malaise partly by scaling down the program. The season this summer has been cut back from nine weeks to eight; the number of students has been reduced, as has the size of the faculty, with 11 jobs lost after strenuous negotiations. 
 After the simmering contention of last fall, matters came to a full boil in April when David Zinman, the music director, resigned, strongly criticizing Mr. Fletcher for the faculty cuts.
 Many board members seem to have felt that Mr. Fletcher was being castigated for steps that they found reasonable. ''There were people who felt that Alan, despite his strengths and weaknesses, was not getting adequate support from the board,'' said Mike Murray, the former vice chairman, who on Monday was named acting chairman. So a group of 18 trustees called the special meeting of the full board to address the situation. 
 Mr. Fletcher acknowledged that he had fences to mend but said that he hoped to develop support based on the fact that all parties ''love the organization.'' He is continuing the search for a new music director, and the festival season opens on July 1.
 ''We need to be very careful as we get through this season,'' Mr. Murray said. ''That's a hope.''

HEADLINE: U.N. Prepares to Vote on Sanctions Resolution Against Iran

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR

 BODY:
UNITED NATIONS -- The United Nations Security Council is scheduled on Wednesday to impose new sanctions against Iran over its nuclear program, taking aim at the financial might of the Revolutionary Guards Corps as well as Iran's military and nuclear industries with the addition of 41 enterprises to the blacklist. 
 The main sanctions seek to impede the nuclear industry, impose an embargo on heavy weapons sales and push for ship inspections. But the major powers, at odds over how strong the sanctions should be, had been negotiating the list of companies and individuals to be singled out. 
 The official new blacklist, obtained by The New York Times in the prelude to the vote, comes after months of negotiations, largely between the Americans and the Chinese over how to expand the list already included in three previous resolutions. 
 Months of haggling continued until the last moment, with the Chinese insisting that nothing -- either in the main body of the resolution or in the three annexes singling out names -- harm Iran's day-to-day economy, diplomats said. The number of entities listed is still roughly twice that on any previous resolution.
 Despite the difficulties, 12 out of 15 nations appear committed to supporting the resolution.
 ''It is strong, it is broad based, and it will have a significant impact on Iran, which is why Iran has worked so hard to try to prevent its adoption,'' Susan E. Rice, the United States envoy to the United Nations, said of the draft resolution scheduled for a vote on Wednesday. ''Our aim remains to persuade Iran to halt its nuclear program and negotiate constructively.''
 Iran called the pending resolution proof that the West does not seek negotiation.
 ''These hasty measures are merely a deviation from the path of constructive transactions and are indicative of the fact that the other parties rather prefer confrontation,'' Mohammad Khazaee, the Iranian envoy to the United Nations, said in a statement. 
 Skeptics noted that this would be the fourth round of sanctions the Security Council has imposed on Iran since 2006, and that none have succeeded in pushing Iran back into negotiations over accusations that it is defying the International Atomic Energy Agency and trying to develop a nuclear bomb. Iran denies it is trying to build a nuclear weapon.
 Despite the sanctions already in place, Iran is enriching uranium at ever-higher levels and building new centrifuges to create larger stockpiles. 
 ''That makes it hard to reach the conclusion that we have the noose around their neck and we just need to pull it a little tighter to bring them to heel,'' said Steven E. Miller, director of the International Security Program at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard. 
 In the draft resolution, just one scientist was singled out for an asset freeze and travel ban: Javad Rahiqi, 56, the head of the Isfahan Nuclear Technology Center. The resolution also strengthens the travel ban against 40 officials already blacklisted. 
 Just one bank is listed: First East Export Bank, which has handled hefty transactions linked to Iran's military establishment. The United States sought to include more banks, including the Central Bank, but settled for one reference in the introduction saying United Nations member states should ''exercise vigilance'' in dealing with the Central Bank. China and others argued that singling out banks would unfairly harm the economy. 
 The list names 23 industrial companies, many of them involved in military contracts or the nuclear industry. Skeptics of the sanctions note that is just a fraction of the Iranian economy, which has been booming. 
 In addition, 15 companies listed are linked to the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps. The I.R.G.C., as it is commonly known, is increasingly the military power that runs Iran, and it led the repression against pro-democracy protesters. 
 The most prominent company, Khatam al-Anbiya Construction, has won billions of dollars in civil and military projects, including a secret nuclear enrichment facility near the holy city of Qum.
 ''We have never gone after the sprawling I.R.G.C. commercial enterprise in quite the same way,'' said one United States official not authorized to comment publicly on the negotiations.

HEADLINE: A Few Steps Short On Jobs

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: leonhardt@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Washington
 One of the political mysteries of the last year is why the White House and Congress have not been even more aggressive about trying to put people back to work.
 It is true that President Obama and Democratic leaders in Congress favor more stimulus and have been stymied by Republicans and, more recently, conservative Blue Dog Democrats worried about the deficit. But it's also true that Mr. Obama, Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid have done less than they could have.
 The president has not wrapped his arms around teachers, firefighters and other government workers facing layoffs and dared Republicans to oppose him, much as he did with financial reregulation. He has not pushed for a big new round of tax cuts, which could also put Republicans in a bind. And the White House has been slow to fill vacancies at the Federal Reserve that could go to officials who favor the Fed's doing more to lift economic growth. 
 None of these steps would have cured the job market on their own. The aftermath of the financial crisis was always going to be long and harsh. Still, the Democrats find themselves in the position of heading into a midterm election campaign with the unemployment rate near 10 percent, knowing that they have not done everything in their power to bring it down.
 Publicly, Mr. Obama's advisers reject this description. ''Job creation and economic recovery were and remain President Obama's top priority,'' Lawrence Summerssaid recently. Mr. Obama is now lobbying the Senate to pass a larger jobs bill than the House passed two weeks ago and pushing for an energy bill that could also create jobs. 
 But when they are not speaking for quotation, some White House and Congressional officials acknowledge that they could have done more to stimulate the economy, and sooner. In part, they have been busy with other things: legislation on health care, finance and education that could shape the economy for decades to come. The bigger reason, though, is politics.
 In the face of near-united Republican opposition, top Democrats have decided that the political costs of aggressively pushing for more stimulus are too high. Any new bill will help only on the margins, and it will give Republicans another chance to blame Mr. Obama for the deficit, even though the current deficit is more of their own party's making. The Democrats may be right, too. We will never know, because we will never be able to re-run the 2010 election under a different set of circumstances.
 Yet the current circumstances bring their own political risks and their own economic costs, especially for anybody who is out of work or soon may be.
 If there was any doubt that the government could put people to work, at least temporarily, last year's $787 billion stimulus program should have removed it. 
 The bill passed in February 2009, when the economy was shedding more than 700,000 jobs a month, and it was greeted with considerable skepticism. Some economists went so far as to suggest it would hurt the economy. Michael Boskin, a Stanford professor and former aide to the first President Bush, wrote an opinion article in The Wall Street Journal on March 6, 2009, blaming Mr. Obama and his policies for the stock market's drop in previous weeks. 
 Soon, though, job losses began shrinking. The details -- a rebound in state spending, an increase in corporate investment and a spurt in home sales helped by tax credits -- suggested that the stimulus bill was a major cause. The Congressional Budget Office and private research firms estimate that the bill has added on the order of 2.5 million jobs. Since Mr. Boskin's op-ed article appeared, stocks are up 56 percent.
 But the stimulus has been lesspopular than effective, polls show. People see that the economy remains in bad shape, and they have a hard time getting excited by the notion that it could be worse.
 These lukewarm views have then been aggravated by the country's very real deficit problem. The federal government has promised to pay out vastly more in Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security over coming decades than it will collect in taxes. Any additional stimulus would only increase the deficit.
 Of course, it would have a much smaller impact on the deficit than the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, the bipartisan Medicare prescription drug program or the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan did. The bond market, for its part, remains utterly calm about the near-term deficit, based on the government's extremely low borrowing costs.
 But the political dynamic is set. Voters are wary of stimulus and worried about the deficit. Almost nobody in Congress is agitating for the ideal economic solution: a combination of short-term stimulus with longer-term spending cuts and tax increases. It's easier just to express somber concern about both the deficit and jobs. 
 Against this backdrop, Mr. Obama and his aides decided not to go all out for more stimulus. 
 The one part of their strategy that seems almost impossible to defend is their approach to the Fed. By law, the Fed's mission is to maintain low inflation and maximum employment. Over the last three months, inflation has been zero. Over the last two years, it has risen at the slowest pace in more than 50 years. Meanwhile, 15 million people remain unemployed.
 Yet the Fed has taken no recent action to spur the economy -- like buying bonds to reduce long-term borrowing costs for households and businesses, as Joseph Gagnon, a former Fed economist, has urged. And the White House and Treasury Department have allowed two of the seven Fed governor spots to sit empty since Mr. Obama took office. He finally announced nominees on April 29, and they await Senate confirmation.
 Despite all this, there is reason to think that more stimulus may finally be on the way. Last Friday's jobs report showed little private-sector job growth in May, which was a good reminder that recoveries from financial crises are usually rocky. The report has the potential to persuade Congress to expand the jobs bill passed by the House, which is now before the Senate.
 As is, the House bill would cut taxes for businesses and temporarily extend jobless benefits, among other things. By the end of the year, it would add about 170,000 jobs, Moody'sEconomy.com estimates. Expanding the bill to include extra Medicaid funds for states -- which seems politically conceivable -- could add 100,000 more jobs. Expanding it to keep teachers employed -- which is unlikely -- could add 200,000 or so.
 Will another half-million jobs make the economy feel strong again? No. Will the next round of stimulus be more popular than the last one? Probably not. 
 Is it nonetheless the right thing to do? That's another question entirely.

HEADLINE: INCUMBENT HOLDS HER SENATE SEAT IN ARKANSAS RACE

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY and ADAM NAGOURNEY; Robbie Brown contributed reporting from Lexington, S.C.., and Shaila Dewan from Little Rock, Ark.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Senator Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas survived a tough challenge from her party's left wing on Tuesday to capture the Democratic nomination in a runoff primary election, resisting the anti-incumbent wave that has defined the midterm election year.
 Mrs. Lincoln withstood a multi-million-dollar campaign against her from organized labor, environmental groups and liberal advocacy organizations from outside Arkansas as she prevailed over Lt. Gov. Bill Halter. She faces a difficult contest in the fall, but her victory challenges the suggestion that voters are poised to oust all officeholders.
 ''We proved that this senator's vote is not for sale and neither is yours,'' Mrs. Lincoln said. ''We took on the outside groups seeking to manipulate our votes.''
 In California, Republican primary voters chose female business executives to run for Senate and for governor after both crushed their opponents. Carly Fiorina, the former chief executive of Hewlett-Packard, was nominated to run for Senate and will face Senator Barbara Boxer, a Democrat. Meg Whitman, the former head of eBay, won the Republican nomination for governor and will face Jerry Brown, a Democrat and former governor. 
 In Nevada, Sharron Angle, a candidate backed by the Tea Party, defeated two establishment Republicans -- including Sue Lowden, a former state party chairwoman -- to win the nomination to challenge Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader, this fall. Mr. Reid is widely viewed as one of the most endangered Democrats, facing a strong tide of disapproval from Nevada voters.
 The nomination of Ms. Angle could provide a boost to Mr. Reid's hopes, and Mr. Reid's aides said they were preparing to seize on positions she has taken to try to portray her as out of touch with most Nevada voters. For example, she has called for the privatization of Social Security, the elimination of the Department of Energy, and cutting back regulation on Wall Street, all positions that could give Mr. Reid's well-financed campaign ammunition to use in television advertisements against her. She also does not have the organization or financial resources that Mr. Reid is bringing to the race.
 In South Carolina, Nikki Haley moved closer to becoming the first female governor of South Carolina as she strongly outpaced three Republican primary rivals in one of the most divisive contests in a series of primaries in 11 states across the country that will further shape the contours of the midterm election season.
 It was the busiest primary day so far this year, a coast-to-coast series of contests that amplified many of the existing themes that have crystallized as the parties select their nominees for governor, the House and the Senate against a backdrop of high unemployment and a sullen economy. But the results also underscored the individuality of the midterm campaign and the unpredictability of the next five months.
 California voters approved a proposition revamping the way local, state and some federal candidates are chosen in primaries, effectively eliminating closed one-party nominating contests in favor of open primaries. Under the system, primaries -- not including presidential ones -- are open to all candidates, regardless of party. The two top vote-drawers go on to face each other in a general election
 The proposal, its backers said, is intended to try to break a pattern where candidates are encouraged to appeal to the most partisan members of their party in order to win primaries.
 The victory by Mrs. Lincoln produced the biggest surprise -- even to some of her supporters -- and a significant blow to a coalition of left-leaning groups, which had spent the day arranging interviews to explain how they had toppled a two-term senator. 
 Her triumph may have been seen by some incumbents, who have been viewing the coming general election with growing fear, as a glimmer of hope on an otherwise bleak horizon. But she won after a personal intervention by one of Arkansas' favorite sons -- former President Bill Clinton, who campaigned aggressively on her behalf. 
 And for all the support that Mr. Halter drew, he was still in a position where he was trying to win an election in a relatively conservative state while running with the backing of some of the most liberal groups in the country, including MoveOn.org and labor unions.
 In South Carolina, Ms. Haley overcame accusations of infidelity and benefited from the endorsement of Sarah Palin in a contest that lived up to the state's reputation for anything-goes politics. But she fell short of claiming an outright majority, setting up a runoff against Representative J. Gresham Barrett, a four-term congressman. They were part of a four-way Republican field seeking to succeed Gov. Mark Sanford, a Republican, who confessed to an affair with an Argentine woman last year and was restricted from seeking re-election by term limits.
 ''We had the kitchen sink thrown at us,'' Ms. Haley said in an interview on Tuesday. ''We are a state of great people. We are a state of dirty politics.''
 In recent weeks, Ms. Haley, 38, had been twice accused of infidelity, which she fiercely denied. She rose in the polls by promising to break an entrenched network that has dominated state politics in South Carolina for decades and she portrayed the unsubstantiated charges of sexual affairs as retaliation for taking on special interests.
 Ms. Haley, an Indian-American, would also become the first racial minority to be elected governor of South Carolina. Democrats nominated Vincent Sheheen on Tuesday, but Republican candidates in South Carolina hold a considerable advantage in the fall.
 Last month, Ms. Haley took a sharp leap in the polls after endorsements and campaign visits from Ms. Palin and Jenny Sanford, the popular former first lady. Ms. Haley had trailed far behind her three Republican rivals in fund-raising and visibility. After she voted Tuesday, she was asked whether she wanted to be seen as a barrier-breaker politician.
 ''These stereotypes of South Carolina are very different from what South Carolina actually is,'' she said. ''If I win, I want it to be historic in the nature that South Carolina is moving forward for reform.''
 In Nevada, Jim Gibbons, the state's embattled Republican governor, lost a nomination for a second term to Brian Sandoval, a former state assemblyman. Mr. Gibbons, whose term has been marked by a series of scandals, a very public divorce and a financial crisis, became the first governor in the history of Nevada to lose his seat in a party primary.
 In Iowa, Republicans nominated Terry Branstad, who served as the state's governor from 1983 to 1999, to run again. He prevailed in a three-way primary and will face Gov. Chet Culver, a Democrat, in the fall. 
 In another South Carolina race, Representative Bob Inglis, a Republican who has occasionally broken with his party on national security and social issues, was forced into a runoff against Trey Gowdy.
 In the only contest of the night that will send a new lawmaker to Congress, voters in the northwest corner of Georgia elected a former State House member, Tom Graves, to fill a House vacancy created when Representative Nathan Deal left to run for governor. It was a low-turnout election and is expected to be the last special Congressional election before November, meaning that any new vacancies will be filled on Nov. 2.
 In Virginia, Robert Hurt, a state senator, easily won a contested Republican primary to challenge Representative Tom Perriello, a freshman Democrat, in November. Mr. Perriello is considered one of the most vulnerable Democratic incumbents because of his votes for both the Democratic health care bill and climate change measures.

HEADLINE: A Gift For Grads: Start-Ups

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
If you have a son or daughter graduating from college this year, you've probably gotten the word. When meeting this year's college grads it's best not to ask: ''Hey, what are you doing next year?'' Too many recent graduates don't have an answer. They can't find jobs even remotely related to their fields. This year's graduation theme is: ''Don't ask. Can't say.''
 We owe our young people something better -- and the solution is not that complicated, although it is amazing how little it is discussed in the Washington policy debates. We need three things: start-ups, start-ups and more start-ups. 
 Good jobs -- in bulk -- don't come from government. They come from risk-takers starting businesses -- businesses that make people's lives healthier, more productive, more comfortable or more entertained, with services and products that can be sold around the world. You can't be for jobs and against business. 
 Alas, though, relations today between the Obama administration and ''business'' are pretty strained. I'm not talking about Wall Street, which deserves Obama's lash. I'm talking about people who actually make stuff and sell it. I am talking about entrepreneurs and innovators. A surprising number of them told me they had voted for Obama, and an equally surprising number of them now tell me they're unhappy. A lot of their criticism is unfair. Obama has never gotten the credit he deserves for stabilizing the terrifying economy he inherited -- with virtually no help from Republicans. And business is never going to like anyone who raises income taxes, especially to pay for other people's health care -- even if it is in the national interest.
 That said, I think part of the business community's complaint about Obama has merit. Although there are many ''innovation'' initiatives ongoing in this administration, they are not well coordinated or a top priority or championed by knowledgeable leadership. This administration is heavily staffed by academics, lawyers and political types. There is no senior person who has run a large company or built and sold globally a new innovative product. And that partly explains why this administration has been mostly interested in pushing taxes, social spending and regulation -- not pushing trade expansion, competitiveness and new company formation. Innovation and competitiveness don't seem to float Obama's boat. He could use a buoyant growth strategy.
 What might that include? I asked two of the best people on this subject, Robert Litan, vice president of research and policy at the Kauffman Foundation, which specializes in innovation, and Curtis Carlson, the chief executive of SRI International, the Silicon Valley-based innovation specialists.
 Carlson said he would begin by creating a cabinet position exclusively for promoting innovation and competitiveness to ensure that America remains ''the world's new company formation leader.'' ''Secretary Newco'' would be focused on pushing through initiatives -- including lower corporate taxes for start-ups, reducing costly regulations (like Sarbanes-Oxley reporting for new companies), and expanding tax breaks for research and development to make it cheaper and faster to start new firms. We need to unleash millions of entrepreneurs.
 Litan said he'd staple a green card to the diploma of every foreign student who graduates from a U.S. university and push for a new meaningful entrepreneurs visa (the current one, the EB-5, requires $1 million of capital that few foreign entrepreneurs have). It would grant temporary residence to any foreigner who comes here to establish a company and permanent residency if that company generates a certain level of new full-time jobs and revenues. One of the best moves we could make, adds Litan, would be a long-term budget deal that would address the looming Social Security/Medicare payouts for baby boomers. Proving to the bond market that we have our long-term fiscal house in order would keep long-term interest rates low and thereby ''encourage private investment more than any tax cut.'' 
 Nevertheless, I'd also cut the capital gains tax for any profit-making venture start-up from 15 percent to 1 percent. I want our best minds to be able to make a killing from starting new companies rather than going to Wall Street and making a killing by betting against existing companies. I'd also impose a carbon tax and balance that with a cut in payroll taxes and corporate taxes. Let's tax what we don't want and encourage what we do. 
 ''Fortunately, this is the best time ever for innovation,'' said Carlson, for three reasons: ''First, although competition is increasingly intense, our global economy opens up huge new market opportunities. Second, most technologies -- since they are increasingly based on ideas and bits and not on atoms and muscle -- are improving at rapid, exponential rates. And third, these two forces -- huge, competitive markets and rapid technological change -- are opening up one major new opportunity after another. It is a time of abundance, not scarcity -- assuming we do the right things with a real national growth strategy. If we do not, it rapidly becomes a world of scarcity.''

HEADLINE: Anti-Incumbent Rage Bypasses Arkansas

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE; Adam Nagourney contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- On a primary election night when the heralded anti-incumbency sentiment was expected to again demonstrate its strength, Senator Blanche Lincoln proved there were clear limits to its power.
 Virtually written off as a likely victim of voter outrage at veteran politicians, Mrs. Lincoln, a two-term Arkansas Democrat, showed that an experienced office-holder with money, message and determination still had a chance to prevail even in a toxic environment.
 ''Blanche has proven once again she is a true independent voice for the people of Arkansas, but she is also a fighter for what she believes in and will never stop standing up for her convictions or for her state,'' said Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. 
 But while Mrs. Lincoln survived to fight on in the general election, incumbents in both parties could not take much solace from the outcome in Arkansas. In South Carolina, Representative Bob Inglis, a veteran Republican, was forced into a runoff election after finishing a distant second in the battle to hold on to his seat. And Gov. Jim Gibbons, Republican of Nevada, lost his primary.
 Mr. Inglis has broken with his party on occasion, and his status provided more evidence that the anger against incumbents applied to both parties heading into November. Should he lose in the June 22 contest, he would be the third House incumbent to fall this year; two of those would be Republicans.
 ''Both parties are having civil wars with their Washington establishments,'' said Joe Trippi, a Democratic strategist. ''You are seeing it on the Republican side; you're seeing it on the Democratic side. The reality is, regardless of what party you are in, if you're an incumbent and it looks like the Washington establishment is backing you, you're in trouble. It's the wrong place to be this year.''
 Mrs. Lincoln looked as if she could become the third Senate incumbent to be defeated this year, following Senator Robert Bennett, Republican of Utah, and Senator Arlen Specter, Democrat of Pennsylvania. 
 She had been unable to finish off Lt. Gov. Bill Halter in the initial primary last month. Labor unions, environmental groups and liberal activists, unhappy with her opposition to a public health insurance option and her other moderate stances, were eager to make an example of her, pouring millions into attack advertisements.
 Mrs. Lincoln had made some missteps in her bid for a third term, notably allowing herself to be painted as the deciding vote in the contentious health care debate, fueling intense criticism and news coverage of her at home. She was also saddled with ties to President Obama in a state where he fared poorly in 2008.
 But Mrs. Lincoln, recently named chairwoman of the Agriculture Committee, fought back, arguing that outside interest groups were trying to take control of the election away from Arkansas voters. And she was helped by former President Bill Clinton, who campaigned at her side as she emphasized her efforts to find solutions in partisan Washington.
 Some top Democratic lawmakers and strategists say they believe Mr. Halter would have made a stronger general election candidate against Representative John Boozman, the Republican nominee, since Mr. Halter has no Washington record and would be free to unleash attacks on Mr. Boozman for his role in Washington. Instead, it will be Mrs. Lincoln comparing her record against that of her home-state Congressional colleague. 
 Republicans are eager to paint her as a willing partner in the Democratic management of Washington. ''She faces an uphill battle explaining to mainstream Arkansas voters why she has consistently voted for the Obama-Pelosi-Reid economic agenda in Washington,'' said Senator John Cornyn of Texas, chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee.
 The strength of the anti-incumbent movement will be tested again this summer in Colorado, where Senator Michael Bennet, the Democrat appointed last year to his seat, faces a primary challenge from Andrew Romanoff, the former State House speaker. House incumbents of both parties face outsider challenges in scattered remaining primaries as well.
 But with the primaries speeding by and most Congressional incumbents appearing headed toward the ballot, the real test apparently will be conducted in November. And since Democrats have more incumbents to lose, they face the greater threat. 
 Incumbent Democrats like Senators Barbara Boxer of California, Patty Murray of Washington and Russ Feingold of Wisconsin -- not to mention Harry Reid of Nevada -- are likely to have to run the races of their careers to overcome voter resentment that has surfaced in the primaries. 
 Mr. Trippi, the party strategist, has some advice: Get as far away from Washington as possible. Even though Mrs. Lincoln dodged a loss Tuesday, that is going to be a taller task for her and many others come November.

HEADLINE: Stimulus Talk Yields to Calls for Deficit Cuts

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER and SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- At a moment when many economists warn that the American economic recovery is likely to be imperiled by prolonged high unemployment and slow growth, President Obama is discovering that the tools available to him last year -- a big economic stimulus and action by the Federal Reserve -- are both now politically untenable.
 The mood in both parties of Congress has turned decidedly anti-deficit, meaning that the job-creation programs once favored by the White House and Democratic leaders in Congress have been cut back, then cut again. It is a measure of the mood that Mr. Obama on Tuesday hailed an initiative by his administration to cut the budgets of most major government agencies by 5 percent, at a time when conventional theory would call for more government spending to lift the economy. 
 Even the Federal Reserve is pulling in its horns. No one could expect it to cut interest rates further -- they are at rock bottom. But spurred by inflation hawks in their midst, the Fed has gotten out of the business of buying Treasury securities and mortgage bonds, one of its main strategies over the last two years for pushing down long-term interest rates. 
 Over the last few weeks, the cautious optimism that the economy is on the mend has given way to more caution than optimism.
 ''My best guess is that we'll have a continued recovery, but it won't feel terrific,'' Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, said at a dinner at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars on Monday night. ''And the reason it won't feel terrific is that it's not going to be fast enough to put back eight million people who lost their jobs within a few years.'' 
 One could almost envision the winces in the White House as Mr. Bernanke observed that the unemployment rate ''will stay high for some time.'' He went on to note that even if the economy grew at 3 percent, which would be considered a healthy pace, it would do little more than keep pace with the normal rate of growth of the work force.
 Virtually every day of late, White House officials have struggled to explain how their strategies to provide economic stimulus to bring down the unemployment rate square with Mr. Obama's oft-expressed commitment to tackle a record budget deficit. They talk about spending this year -- in modest amounts -- while waiting for the prescriptions of the president's commission on debt reduction, which reports, conveniently, a few weeks after the midterm elections.
 In the next breath, they say that the only long-term strategy that will get Americans back to work and bring the deficit under control is promoting rapid economic growth. That is the elixir that allowed the Clinton administration, where many members of Mr. Obama's team cut their teeth, to briefly wipe out budget deficits. But for now, it is unclear where that growth will come from -- and how soon. 
 So rather than promoting another broad stimulus package, the White House is pointing to a series of familiar-sounding, low-cost measures to create jobs: stimulating export-oriented manufacturing, subsidizing energy-efficiency improvements by homeowners, preventing layoffs of teachers and police officers and pressing for a new (and unpaid for) highway bill that could, like the Census, create a short-term burst in hiring.
 Lawrence H. Summers, the director of the National Economic Council and the economic adviser at Mr. Obama's elbow, argued that the effects of last year's $787 billion spending program had not fully kicked in. ''Given fiscal lag, the Recovery Act is still gaining force and having increasing impact,'' he said, adding that the administration's job approach ''goes beyond spending programs'' to include mortgage relief for homeowners and expanded lending to small businesses. ''We will not let up on jobs as a priority until unemployment returns to normal levels.''
 Although Congress has enacted or is likely to pass an estimated $200 billion worth of additional spending since last year's stimulus package, the appetite for a big new fiscal boost has slackened. 
 The anti-deficit mood is not limited to Washington. Over the last two days, Britain and Germany have announced austerity plans, in contrast to what many in Europe were arguing for a year ago. Spain and France have announced similar moves. The politics of those moves vary from country to country: in Britain, it is explained by the election of a Conservative government; in Germany by the usual postwar German aversion to deficits.
 But the crisis in Greece has focused minds across Europe, especially in Spain, Portugal and Ireland. So just two weeks ahead of a meeting of the Group of 20 economic powers in Toronto, there is a widespread consensus that grand stimulus programs are a thing of the past. 
 The box that Europe, the Obama administration and Congress find themselves in today -- desperate to stimulate the economy and fearful of the political reaction -- gives new meaning to Milton Friedman's famous line from the mid-1960s. ''In one sense, we are all Keynesians now,'' he wrote to Time magazine, referring to the theories of John Maynard Keynes, who called for government spending to counter downward cycles in the economy. In a less-remembered continuation of that sentence, he added, ''in another, nobody is any longer a Keynesian.'' 
 Today they are periodic Keynesians. The Senate has taken up a jobs bill that could cost $100 billion over the next decade, a fraction of last year's historic stimulus package, but significant by the standards of other such jobs packages over the last two decades. ''Here in the Senate, jobs will remain priority No. 1,'' Senator Charles E. Schumer, a Democrat of New York, said Tuesday. ''It'll be almost an obsession to us.'' 
 Not surprisingly, the parties cannot agree on the best path to satisfy their obsessions. 
 ''The failure of this Congress to even produce a budget, let alone get spending under control, is doing direct harm to our economy,'' Representative Dave Camp of Michigan, the top Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee, said Tuesday, arguing that the $13 trillion national debt was choking off growth. 
 Although a growing number of economists now expect the Fed to start tightening monetary policy next year, rather than later this year, there is little sense that it will resume buying assets and printing money to do so -- a strategy called quantitative easing.
 Given that inflation is well below the Fed's unofficial target of about 2 percent, Joseph E. Gagnon, a former Fed economist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, argued, ''With both employment and inflation below desired levels over the foreseeable future, the case for more monetary ease is strong.''
 But Johan Van Overtveldt, an economist in Brussels and the author of a book on Mr. Bernanke, said he did not believe the Fed was ready to buy that argument just yet. ''The Fed has already carried out monetary policies never seen before in American history,'' he said. ''A second round of quantitative easing at the moment would substantially increase inflationary risks.''

HEADLINE: A Former Top Aide to Paterson Languishes as an Inquiry Moves Slowly

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM; Serge F. Kovaleski and William K. Rashbaum contributed reporting.

 BODY:
In late February, Gov. David A. Paterson asked Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo to investigate his administration's handling of a domestic violence case involving a top aide to the governor.
 Within days, administration officials were interviewed, phone records were gathered by investigators, Mr. Paterson ended his bid for election and a succession of his senior officials resigned.
 But three and a half months later, Mr. Paterson has yet to be questioned, and a date has not even been set for him to be interviewed. A lawyer for David W. Johnson, the aide accused of assaulting his girlfriend, said he had not had contact with investigators for months. A person close to one of the central witnesses in the inquiry also said it had been months since the witness had been asked for additional testimony. 
 ''I'm hopeful that the length of time the investigation has been going on means that they are being thorough, but at the same time I have not heard of any activity since the first days of April,'' Mr. Johnson's lawyer, Oscar Michelen, said. 
 ''We are waiting for their final report so that my client can get on with his life,'' Mr. Michelen added. ''He has been in limbo because he was suspended without pay and can't get new employment until this is all resolved.''
 Some people close to the case cited a number of reasons for the striking quiet: two weeks after the case began, Mr. Cuomo recused himself from investigating the administration of Mr. Paterson, a onetime political rival, and turned the case over to Judith S. Kaye, the former chief judge of New York, who is said to feel little urgency or political pressure to finish. 
 Further complicating matters, Ms. Kaye has also been tasked with investigating not only the handling of the domestic violence case, but also a perjury accusation leveled against the governor by the State Commission on Public Integrity, related to his receipt of more than $2,000 worth of Yankees tickets during the World Series last fall -- a potential violation of the state's gift ban for public officials. 
 Some Yankees officials were interviewed in April and May; others involved in the matter still have not been interviewed. The attorney general's office is said to be further along in the abuse investigation than the Yankees case, which it received later.
 ''I'm just plugging ahead,'' Ms. Kaye said when reached by phone, declining to say more. She is working on the cases with the attorney general's staff, including Ellen N. Biben, a special deputy attorney general who runs the office's public integrity division. She is also being assisted by David Meister, a partner at her law firm, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. Mr. Meister, a former federal prosecutor, declined to comment.
 John Milgrim, a spokesman for the attorney general's office, said on behalf of Ms. Kaye: ''This remains an active, ongoing investigation, and it would therefore be inappropriate to comment further.''
 Ms. Kaye, who took on the cases free, has had a full plate herself. She and Skadden were hired by the Working Families Party to do an internal review of its controversial relationship with its for-profit campaign consulting unit, Data and Field Services Inc., a review that ended this month with a 25-page report. 
 ''There's no rush,'' said Hank Sheinkopf, a top Democratic political consultant who does not work for Mr. Cuomo. ''What investigation has ever moved quickly? Most investigations take a long time and are rarely completed when people think they ought to be. Some investigations go on for years. It's no surprise that this is not being done instantaneously. The charges here are serious.''
 He said political considerations had largely diminished once the governor became a lame duck.
 The Paterson case was set into motion by a report in The New York Times about an alleged assault by Mr. Johnson on his then girlfriend, Sherr-una Booker, last Halloween at her apartment in the Bronx, an episode under the jurisdiction of the New York Police Department. Ms. Booker went to Family Court days after the alleged assault and gained an order of protection, but had difficulty serving the court papers on Mr. Johnson. She was due back in court early last February.
 Both the State Police and the governor spoke with Ms. Booker while she was seeking the court's protection. Ms. Booker complained in court that she had felt pressured by the State Police to drop the case, but was adamant that she would not.
 The case was ultimately dismissed without prejudice when Ms. Booker did not show up for the February court date. Mr. Paterson has conceded he spoke with her the day before the court date but has insisted he did nothing to intervene in the case.
 One of the central aims of the investigation is to determine the nature of Mr. Paterson's contacts with Ms. Booker. Investigators have been told he enlisted two state workers, including his press secretary, in an effort to have Ms. Booker say publicly that no violence had taken place last Halloween, according to several people with knowledge of the case.
 While it remains unclear how long the case will drag on as the Paterson administration winds down, the uncertainty has left Mr. Johnson facing financial hardship, according to people with knowledge of his circumstances. He has been out of work for more than three months and unable to collect unemployment, they said, because he is still technically employed by the state.

HEADLINE: China Says North Korean Shot and Killed 3 of Its Citizens

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG; Li Bibo contributed research.

 BODY:
SHANGHAI -- The Chinese Foreign Ministry said Tuesday that a North Korean border guard shot dead three Chinese citizens and wounded one last week in northeast China, prompting the Chinese government to file a formal complaint. 
 The shootings took place last Friday at the China-North Korea border by the Chinese city of Dandong, in Liaoning Province, said Qin Gang, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, at a regularly scheduled news conference in Beijing. The four Chinese were residents of Dandong, and the North Korean guard believed that they were engaged in illegal trade across the border, Mr. Qin added, according to a report by the Chinese-language edition of Global Times, an official newspaper.
 ''China attaches great importance to that and has immediately raised a solemn representation with the D.P.R.K.,'' Mr. Qin said, using the initials for North Korea's formal name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. ''Now the case is under investigation.'' 
 Mr. Qin gave the information in response to a question at the news conference about unconfirmed South Korean news reports on the shooting, but he did not provide more details. Nonetheless, Mr. Qin's confirmation of the shooting and his description of China's reaction were unusual, since China rarely upbraids North Korea in public.
 It was unclear how the shootings would affect relations between North Korea and China, which is North Korea's closest ally in the region. China has been the host of the six-nation talks, a series of negotiations that also includes the United States, North Korea, South Korea, Russia and Japan aimed at curbing North Korea's nuclear program. Last month, Kim Jong-il, the North Korean leader, made his first visit to China in four years, crossing the border by train and stopping in Dalian and then Beijing.
 The actions of North Korean leaders have been made more opaque and unpredictable in recent months by what analysts believe is Mr. Kim's effort to engineer a transfer of power to his third son, Kim Jong-un, 27. 
 China has come under pressure recently from the United States and South Korea to take a tough stand on what American and South Korean officials say was a torpedo attack on a South Korean warship in March that killed 46 sailors. China has taken a circumspect approach to the assault, to the disappointment of White House officials. China's overriding principle on North Korea is to avoid actions that would lead to instability there, analysts say.
 North Korea's economy is in tatters, and the North Korean government relies on aid from China to help alleviate widespread food shortages. China continues to engage in trade with North Korea, and Dandong is a hub for the transfer of goods between the countries. The Yalu River forms the border there, and Chinese tourists regularly cross into North Korea from Dandong to the North Korean town of Sinuiju and beyond. North Korean refugees also cross illegally into China in that area, often with the aid of Christian groups.
 North Korean border guards have been known to act unpredictably. In 2009, two American journalists were detained by North Korean guards near the Chinese town of Yanji. They were released after former President Bill Clinton traveled to North Korea.

HEADLINE: The Climate Majority

BYLINE: By JON A. KROSNICK. 
Jon A. Krosnick is a professor of communication, political science and psychology at Stanford.

 BODY:
Stanford, Calif.
 ON Thursday, the Senate will vote on a resolution proposed by Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, that would scuttle the Environmental Protection Agency's plans to limit emissions of greenhouse gases by American businesses. 
 Passing the resolution might seem to be exactly what Americans want. After all, national surveys released during the last eight months have been interpreted as showing that fewer and fewer Americans believe that climate change is real, human-caused and threatening to people.
 But a closer look at these polls and a new survey by my Political Psychology Research Group show just the opposite: huge majorities of Americans still believe the earth has been gradually warming as the result of human activity and want the government to institute regulations to stop it.
 In our survey, which was financed by a grant to Stanford from the National Science Foundation, 1,000 randomly selected American adults were interviewed by phone between June 1 and Monday. When respondents were asked if they thought that the earth's temperature probably had been heating up over the last 100 years, 74 percent answered affirmatively. And 75 percent of respondents said that human behavior was substantially responsible for any warming that has occurred. 
 For many issues, any such consensus about the existence of a problem quickly falls apart when the conversation turns to carrying out specific solutions that will be costly. But not so here. 
 Fully 86 percent of our respondents said they wanted the federal government to limit the amount of air pollution that businesses emit, and 76 percent favored government limiting business's emissions of greenhouse gases in particular. Not a majority of 55 or 60 percent -- but 76 percent.
 Large majorities opposed taxes on electricity (78 percent) and gasoline (72 percent) to reduce consumption. But 84 percent favored the federal government offering tax breaks to encourage utilities to make more electricity from water, wind and solar power. 
 And huge majorities favored government requiring, or offering tax breaks to encourage, each of the following: manufacturing cars that use less gasoline (81 percent); manufacturing appliances that use less electricity (80 percent); and building homes and office buildings that require less energy to heat and cool (80 percent).
 Thus, there is plenty of agreement about what people do and do not want government to do.
 Our poll also indicated that some of the principal arguments against remedial efforts have been failing to take hold. Only 18 percent of respondents said they thought that policies to reduce global warming would increase unemployment and only 20 percent said they thought such initiatives would hurt the nation's economy. Furthermore, just 14 percent said the United States should not take action to combat global warming unless other major industrial countries like China and India do so as well.
 Our findings might seem implausible in light of recent polls that purport to show that Americans are increasingly skeptical about the very existence of climate change. But in fact, those polls did not produce conflicting evidence at all.
 Consider, for example, the most publicized question from a 2009 Pew Research Center poll: ''From what you've read and heard, is there solid evidence that the average temperature on earth has been getting warmer over the past few decades, or not?'' This question measured perceptions of scientific evidence that the respondent has read or heard about, not the respondents' personal opinions about whether the earth has been warming. Someone who has had no exposure to scientific evidence or who perceives the evidence to be equivocal may nonetheless be convinced that the earth has been heating up by, say, the early blossoming of plants in his garden.
 Or consider a widely publicized Gallup question: ''Thinking about what is said in the news, in your view, is the seriousness of global warming generally exaggerated, generally correct or is it generally underestimated?'' This question asked about respondents' perceptions of the news, not the respondents' perception of warming. A person who believes climate change has been happening might also feel that news media coverage of it has been exaggerated.
 Questions in other polls that sought to tap respondents' personal beliefs about the existence and causes of warming violated two of the cardinal rules of good survey question design: ask about only one thing at a time, and choose language that makes it easy for respondents to understand and answer each question. 
 Imagine being asked this, from a poll by CNN: ''Which of the following statements comes closest to your view of global warming: Global warming is a proven fact and is mostly caused by emissions from cars and industrial facilities like power plants and factories; global warming is a proven fact and is mostly caused by natural changes that have nothing to do with emissions from cars and industrial facilities; or, global warming is a theory that has not yet been proven.'' 
 Notice that the question didn't even offer the opportunity for respondents to say they believe global warming is definitely not happening -- not the sort of question that will provide the most valid measurements.
 When surveys other than ours have asked simple and direct questions, they have produced results similar to ours. For example, in November, an ABC News/Washington Post survey found that 72 percent of respondents said the earth has been heating up, and a December poll by Ipsos/McClatchy found this proportion to be 70 percent. 
 Our surveys did reveal a small recent decline in the proportion of people who believe global warming has been happening, from 84 percent in 2007 to 80 percent in 2008 to 74 percent today. Statistical analysis of our data revealed that this decline is attributable to perceptions of recent weather changes by the minority of Americans who have been skeptical about climate scientists. 
 In terms of average earth temperature, 2008 was the coldest year since 2000. Scientists say that such year-to-year fluctuations are uninformative, and people who trust scientists therefore ignore this information when forming opinions about global warming's existence. Citizens who do not trust climate scientists, however, base their conclusions on their personal observations of nature. These low-trust individuals were especially aware of the recent decline in average world temperatures; they were the ones in our survey whose doubts about global warming have increased since 2007.
 This explanation is especially significant, because it suggests that the small recent decline in the proportion of people who believe in global warming is likely to be temporary. If the earth's temperature begins to rise again, these individuals may reverse course and rejoin the large majority who still think warming is real. 
 Growing public skepticism has, in recent months, been attributed to news reports about e-mail messages hacked from the computer system at the University of East Anglia in Britain (characterized as showing climate scientists colluding to silence unconvinced colleagues) and by the discoveries of alleged flaws in reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
 Our new survey discredited this claim in multiple ways. First, we found no decline in Americans' trust in environmental scientists: 71 percent of respondents said they trust these scientists a moderate amount, a lot or completely, a figure that was 68 percent in 2008 and 70 percent in 2009. Only 9 percent said they knew about the East Anglia e-mail messages and believed they indicated that climate scientists should not be trusted, and only 13 percent of respondents said so about the I.P.C.C. reports' alleged flaws.
 Interestingly, Americans are not alone in having their views portrayed inaccurately. A February BBC News survey asked Britons, ''From what you know and have heard, do you think that the earth's climate is changing and global warming is taking place?'' Seventy-five percent of respondents answered affirmatively, down a somewhat improbable eight percentage points from 83 percent in November. A BBC headline blared, ''Climate Skepticism on the Rise,'' when it should have proclaimed that a huge majority of Britons still share common ground with one another and with Americans on this issue.
 GLOBAL warming has attracted what political scientists dub an ''issue public'': millions of Americans who are passionate about this subject and put pressure on government to follow their wishes. For over a decade, this group has been of typical issue-public size, about 15 percent of American adults. 
 Although issue publics usually divide about equally on opposing sides -- think of abortion or immigration -- 88 percent of the climate change issue public in our survey believed that global warming has been happening; 88 percent attributed responsibility for it to human action; 92 percent wanted the federal government to limit the amount of greenhouse gases that businesses can emit. Put simply, the people whose votes are most powerfully shaped by this issue are sending a nearly unanimous signal to their elected representatives.
 All this makes global warming a singular issue in American politics. Even as we are told that Americans are about equally divided into red and blue, a huge majority shares a common vision of climate change. This creates a unique opportunity for elected representatives to satisfy a lot of voters. 
 When senators vote on emissions limits on Thursday, there is one other number they might want to keep in mind: 72 percent of Americans think that most business leaders do not want the federal government to take steps to stop global warming. A vote to eliminate greenhouse gas regulation is likely to be perceived by the nation as a vote for industry, and against the will of the people.

HEADLINE: Behind Gusts of a Military Chill: A More Forceful China

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES; Jonathan Ansfield contributed reporting, and Li Bibo contributed research.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- If anyone ever doubted it, a testy exchange at a Singapore conference last weekend made it clear: Relations between the American and Chinese militaries are in a very deep freeze. 
 What is genuinely in doubt is whether that is but a burr in the two nations' broader relationship, or a portent. 
 The verbal fusillade unfolded Saturday at the Shangri-La Dialogue, a meeting of the defense ministers of 28 Asia-Pacific nations attended by, among others, Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates and Gen. Ma Xiaotian, the deputy chief of the general staff of the People's Liberation Army. 
 General Ma laced his speech with barely disguised jabs at the United States. ''A cold-war mentality still exists'' in unnamed nations, he said, with ''the threat to use force in international relations and interference in other countries' internal affairs'' -- code language for American arms sales to Taiwan, which China regards as its territory.
 In his speech, Mr. Gates was even more blunt. Military ties between the nations are ''held hostage'' by the Taiwan issue, he said, even though American arms sales to Taiwan ''have been a reality for decades.'' China cannot change that reality, he said -- and in any case, Washington does not support Taiwan's independence from the mainland. 
 That exchange followed China's formal rejection last week of Mr. Gates's proposal to stop in Beijing during his current swing through Asia. And that followed a Chinese admiral's unexpectedly biting lecture on American ''hegemony,'' in a private session during last month's Strategic and Economic Dialogue in Beijing, that left American diplomats furious and appeared to signal divergent attitudes between China's civilian and military leaders.
 Taken separately, the episodes mean little. Experts who speak of Chinese-American military relations regularly use words like ''albatross'' and ''millstone'' to describe their impact on cooperation between Washington and Beijing. Suspicion and, at times, hostility define meetings between military leaders.
 But there is a context: an increasing assertiveness in global economic and diplomatic affairs by Chinese leaders. Advocates of a tougher and more nationalistic China have gained influence in the past 6 to 12 months, and their impact is being felt more in both foreign and domestic policies.
 To some Western analysts, that suggests that the Obama administration's fundamental approach toward China -- to make China a responsible partner in global affairs by giving Beijing a larger stake in solving international problems -- needs retooling.
 ''There has been a real sea change and hardening of attitude in Chinese government thinking about relations with the United States over the past six or eight months,'' said David Shambaugh, a leading expert on the Chinese military and the Communist Party at George Washington University. ''Under these circumstances, Washington needs to undertake a comprehensive review of its China strategy and policy from top to bottom.''
 Stephanie Kleine-Ahlbrandt, a Beijing analyst with the International Crisis Group, said the Obama administration's hopes for cooperation with Beijing ''have been more optimistic than current scenarios warrant.''
 ''China and the U.S. continue to have fundamentally different values, goals and capabilities,'' she said, citing China's reluctance to press for the truth in the sinking of a South Korean ship, an attack that an international investigation determined was the work of North Korea.
 Signs of hardening Chinese policies are easy to find. Beijing recently adopted a new, tougher stance on its claims to disputed islands in the South China Sea, telling the Philippines, Indonesia, Vietnam and other claimants that the islands are a ''core national interest'' beyond settling in regional negotiations. China's demand is to bargain nation by nation, giving Beijing a decided advantage over smaller neighbors. 
 The United States has struggled with limited success to recruit China as a partner in United Nations actions, not only against North Korea but also against Iran's nuclear program. Both American and European businesses are increasingly agitated over what they regard as unfair curbs on their ability to compete with domestic companies in China's vast and growing market, despite Chinese guarantees.
 Yet it is not clear that the Chinese military's hostility reflects China's diplomatic strategy, much less dictates it. Part of the problem is that no one outside Beijing is sure how Chinese leaders draft their foreign policy toward the United States, which, by Beijing's measure, is far and away its most important partner.
 ''Many, if not all, officials of the U.S. government believe the current situation is one in which the military has the bit in its mouth and is taking the lead on this issue,'' said Michael Swaine, a China scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. In their assessment, Mr. Swaine said, ''the Communist Party and the foreign affairs apparatus is not terribly happy about it, but is going along with it.''
 The truth is that nobody knows. Policy toward the United States -- especially military policy -- is concocted in a black box at the government's highest levels, Mr. Swaine and others said. 
 Mr. Gates may have given Chinese military officials a needed slap in the face with his remarks in Singapore. Or he may have overstepped his bounds.
 ''Mr. Gates is a great statesman and always very frank,'' said Shi Yinhong, an expert on Chinese-American relations at Renmin University in Beijing. ''But to deal with the Chinese, maybe he makes his language too frank. Chinese leaders, and especially Chinese generals, may find it quite difficult to take.''

HEADLINE: Energy and Chemical Companies Help Give the Market a Lift

BYLINE: By SUSANNA G. KIM; Sewell Chan contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Stocks were mostly higher on Tuesday as increases in energy and material shares helped to offset a down day for technology. 
 Partly in response to encouraging comments late Monday by the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, stocks started the day higher. 
 Mr. Bernanke said in Washington that the recovery would continue, ''but it won't feel terrific.'' He also said that he did not expect the economy to see a double-dip recession.
 The technology sector declined after an analyst at the Susquehanna Financial Group downgraded the shares of Intel and Broadcom.
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 123.49 points, or 1.26 percent, to close at 9,939.98. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 11.53 points, or 1.10 percent, to 1,062.00, while the Nasdaq composite index fell 3.33 points, or 0.15 percent, to 2,170.57. 
 The euro was trading at $1.1925, down from $1.1936 late Monday. Gold retreated, closing down $3.70 at $1,236.55, after setting a record high of $1,254.50 in early trading.
 In the absence of any negative developments from Europe, equity investors turned their focus to recently strong corporate earnings, ending a two-session losing streak that started Friday with a disappointing unemployment report. 
 ''With the tremendous surge in earnings that we've had, we have a situation in which this pullback has created a very attractive valuation environment,'' said Henry B. Smith, chief investment officer of Haverford Investments. 
 Crude oil rose 55 cents, to $71.99 a barrel, bringing energy companies along with it. Exxon Mobil shares rose 3.3 percent, and ConocoPhillips gained 2.4 percent. 
 Shares of DuPont rose 3.7 percent after the chemical maker reaffirmed its 2010 earnings forecast.
 Mr. Smith said he was watching to see whether the ''economically sensitive'' industrial and basic materials sectors, including companies like DuPont, would lead a rally ''once the correction has subsided.''
 Many bank shares also rebounded: Bank of America was up 2.6 percent, Citigroup rose 2.2 percent and JPMorgan Chase gained 2 percent. Goldman Sachs, however, fell 0.92 percent. 
 Interest rates were higher. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 11/32, to 102 21/32, and the yield rose to 3.18 percent from 3.14 percent late Monday. 
 The downgrade of Intel and Broadcom contributed to the Nasdaq's decline. 
 Christopher Caso of Susquehanna Financial cited a ''weakening PC environment'' because of higher prices in Europe brought on by the decline in the euro. 
 Intel shares dropped 1.6 percent and Broadcom fell 1.2 percent. Amazon was down 3.5 percent, Google fell 0.6 percent and Apple declined 1.4 percent.

HEADLINE: Clinton Seeks to Mend Frayed Ties in Visit to Ecuador

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

 BODY:
QUITO, Ecuador Venturing into one of Latin America's less friendly capitals, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton declared on Tuesday that the Obama administration was intent on having better relationships in this region, even with leftist governments like Ecuador's, which became stridently anti-American during the Bush administration.
 ''I don't know any two countries that agree on everything,'' Mrs. Clinton said after more than two hours of meetings and lunch with President Rafael Correa. ''From our perspective, we have reached out and feel very much as though we are forging a new set of relationships.'' 
 Mr. Correa who aligns himself with the Venezuela's leftist leader, Hugo Chavez, and who once said Mr. Chavez's comparison of George W. Bush to Satan was unfair to the devil seemed charmed.
 ''The new left that I represent is not anti-anything,'' he insisted. ''We're not anti-American; we love America.'' He said he was relieved that the policies of the Bush years were over, and added that his years of studying at the University of Illinois had been the happiest of his life.
 Mrs. Clinton's stopover, on the second day of a four-day swing through Latin America, was a modest effort to try to pull Mr. Correa away from his leftist colleagues. But his popularity in the region suggests he is unlikely to swear off moves like keeping ties with Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.
 Nor did the warm words from both leaders after their meeting mask real disputes between the United States and Ecuador, chiefly over an agreement with neighboring Colombia that broadens American access to military bases there to train Colombian soldiers to crack down on drug traffickers.
 Ecuador said the program poses a threat to the sovereignty of Latin American countries. Mr. Correa said that there were good reasons for Ecuador to remain suspicious, but that Mrs. Clinton had shared information about the program in an effort to settle his concerns.
 ''I want to put your mind at ease,'' she said afterward. ''This agreement between the United States and Colombia is solely intended to assist Colombia in its struggle against internal threats.''
 There were hints of steel behind Mr. Correa's smile, particularly when pressed about why the Obama administration has not been able to put relations with several Latin American countries on better footing.
 ''If you feel that Ecuador should bow to outside pressure, you will not find that in Ecuador, or Venezuela, or Bolivia,'' Mr. Correa said. Bolivia, like Venezuela, has taken an increasingly anti-American line.
 During their meeting, Mrs. Clinton also pushed Mr. Correa to improve his record on press freedom. Ecuador is debating a new media law that critics say is intended to crack down on the press. A local journalist rose to publicly warn against the new law, earning a sharp rebuke from Mr. Correa, who said the law was needed to curb abuses by powerful media owners.
 After her meeting with Mr. Correa, Mrs. Clinton delivered a speech at a museum in which she called for more economic equality across Latin America. Among a list of remedies, she called for tax reform to curb rampant evasion and to reduce the burden of taxes on the poor.
 ''It is also a simple fact that the wealthy do not pay their fair share,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ''We can't mince words about this. Levels of tax evasion are unacceptably high as much or more than 50 percent in some of this region's economies when it comes to personal income tax.''
 ''Acknowledging this is not class warfare; it is not even us-versus-them rhetoric,'' she said. ''It is a matter of recognizing that this cannot be a zero-sum game. We cannot take a winner-takes-all approach to our economic future.''
 Mrs. Clinton also cited the growth of the black-market economy, which further reduces tax receipts of overburdened governments. She praised President Correa for working to increase social inclusion in Ecuador, which still suffers from wide disparities of wealth in urban and rural areas.
 He returned the praise, saying that he admired both her and her husband, former President Bill Clinton. As for the current American president, he said people in Latin America ''loved'' Barack Obama.

HEADLINE: Focusing on Future, Premier In Japan Unveils Cabinet

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER

 BODY:
TOKYO -- Japan's new prime minister named a cabinet on Tuesday aimed at refocusing his governing party on the nation's huge political and economic problems and making a break with the financial scandals that dogged his predecessor.
 In his inaugural news conference, Prime Minister Naoto Kan vowed to regain political momentum for his Democratic Party, which lost public support after his predecessor, Yukio Hatoyama, squandered a historic election mandate with broken promises and indecisive leadership. Mr. Hatoyama was driven to resign last week by plunging approval ratings. 
 Mr. Kan also promised to tackle problems like poverty and Japan's growing national debt in creating what he called a ''society with the minimum amount of unhappiness.''
 Earlier on Tuesday, Mr. Kan, 63, Japan's fifth new prime minister in four years, was officially sworn into office by Emperor Akihito during a ceremony at the Imperial Palace in Tokyo. 
 There were also early signs that Japan's scandal-weary voters were warming to Mr. Kan, a straight-talking former civic activist. Polls have shown a bounce for his party, and T-shirts appeared in Tokyo stores with a twist on an English-language slogan, ''Yes We Kan.''
 Mr. Kan, a veteran of Japan's political opposition, kept largely the same lineup as the Hatoyama government, signaling that he would continue the party's efforts to shake up Japan's unresponsive political system. But he also added several younger members as he strives to win back voters ahead of parliamentary elections next month.
 ''This cabinet is youthful and fresh, and filled with people who love to work,'' said Yoshito Sengoku, the newly appointed chief cabinet secretary.
 One new face is Renho Murata, a 42-year-old half-Japanese, half-Taiwanese former television announcer who won attention last year when she grilled bureaucrats during an inquiry into wasteful spending. Ms. Murata, who usually goes by Renho, was named minister in charge of administrative reform, giving her a leading role in the Democrats' pledge to rein in the nation's powerful bureaucracy.
 Yoshihiko Noda, 53, a fiscal hawk, was named finance minister, in a sign that the new government will seek to restrain Japan's ballooning government debt, already twice the size of the nation's $5 trillion economy.
 Mr. Kan kept the previous cabinet's foreign and defense ministers, who helped negotiate a deal last month to relocate a United States air base on Okinawa. On Tuesday, Mr. Kan reiterated his intention to honor that agreement, while trying to find other ways to reduce the American military burden on the southern island.
 Mr. Kan said he would seek to meet with President Obama during a Group of 8 summit meeting later this month in Canada. He appears keen to keep smoother ties with Washington than did his predecessor, at a time when the region also faces increased tensions from the sinking of a South Korean warship in March, apparently by a North Korean torpedo.
 Domestic news media attention was also focused on the omission from the new lineup of one face in particular, Ichiro Ozawa, the governing party's shadowy power broker and its secretary general under Mr. Hatoyama. 
 A gifted political tactician, Mr. Ozawa is credited with engineering last summer's landslide election victory, which ended a half-century of virtual one-party rule here. But his backroom deal-making became the focus of a series of financing scandals that undermined Mr. Hatoyama, who was also investigated for misreported political contributions from his mother.
 Since his election by Parliament on Friday, Mr. Kan has reshuffled top party posts in an apparent effort to distance himself from Mr. Ozawa. He replaced Mr. Ozawa as secretary general, the party's No. 2 post, with Yukio Edano, 46, a prominent bureaucracy fighter in the Hatoyama government who has been a critic of Mr. Ozawa's influence. 
 ''From today, we will no longer accept contributions from corporations and groups,'' Mr. Edano told reporters. ''We must regain public trust in the Democratic Party.''
 Over the weekend, public opinion polls by major newspapers found a larger-than-expected bounce for the Democrats' approval ratings, which jumped to the mid-30s from around 20 percent after Mr. Kan took over.

HEADLINE: The Blog Prophet of Doom

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr.

 BODY:
BARCELONA, Spain -- For years, almost nobody paid attention to the sky-is-falling alarms of Edward Hugh, a gregarious British blogger and self-taught economist who repeatedly predicted that the euro zone could not survive.
 Living a largely hand-to-mouth existence here on his part-time teacher's salary, he sent one post after another into the Internet wilderness. It was the height of policy folly, he warned, to think that aging, penny-pinching Germans could successfully coexist under one currency umbrella with the more youthful, credit-card-wielding Irish, Greeks and Spaniards who shared the euro with them.
But now that the European sovereign debt crisis is rattling world markets, driving the euro lower almost every day and raising doubts about the future of the monetary union, his voluminous musings have become a must-read for an influential and growing global audience, including policy makers in the White House.
 He has even been courted by the International Monetary Fund, which recently asked him to fly to Madrid to assist in its analysis of the Spanish economy. 
 ''It's quite nice, actually,'' Mr. Hugh, 61, said with amusement as he leaned back in a plush town car that was taking him to his latest speaking engagement organized by the Circulo de Economia, an influential business lobbying group in Barcelona. ''I am meeting all sorts of interesting people and they are paying me to have lunch with them.''
 But in other ways, his life has changed very little. Last week, in fact, he even had to borrow money from friends to buy clothes presentable enough to allow him to address the conference of Spanish politicians and business executives. He still mostly supports himself by teaching English to locals here, where he has lived for two decades.
 ''I guess I am countercyclical,'' he said with a laugh. ''For all the years during the boom when everyone was doing well here, I wasn't doing anything. Now I am a household name in Catalonia.''
 Well, not quite. The idea of the economist as a pop celebrity in the mold of a Nouriel Roubini, whose early prediction that the United States housing market would collapse later brought him fame and a worldwide consulting brand, or a Paul Krugman, the Nobel-winning economist who writes an Op-Ed Page column for The New York Times, is still unformed in Europe and in particular in Spain.
 But as questions rise over how European governments can escape their debt trap and resume growth, Mr. Hugh, who has been pondering this topic for years, is for the first time being turned to for insights and wisdom.
 His bleak message, in newspaper columns, local television and radio appearances, and in meetings with officials, is almost always the same: since Spain and other struggling countries of the euro zone like Greece, Portugal, Ireland and Italy cannot devalue their common currency unilaterally, they have little choice but to endure what would essentially be a 20 percent internal devaluation instead. That means their public and private sector wages need to fall by roughly that amount if those countries are ever to restore competitiveness, lift exports and bring in the cash needed to pay down their debts.
 ''Why haven't these countries converged'' with the rest of Europe? he asks. ''It's demographics. As populations age, there are fewer people in their 20s to 40s to buy new houses, so they save more. The younger a country is, the more dependent it is on credit to get growth.''
 Germany, where the average age is 45 and rising even as the population is beginning to shrink, is a nation of savers, and public policy has encouraged keeping wages under control and building up export industries.
 By contrast, the younger Greeks, Irish and Spaniards went on borrowing binges, driven in particular by rising demands for new homes and consumer goods that, in several cases, turned into housing bubbles before going bust. Wages were pushed up, encouraging spending but soon making it all but impossible for their industries to compete with the thrifty Germans, Dutch and other Northern Europeans.
 Most economists, beholden as they are to their ''promiscuous but essentially useless'' economic models, Mr. Hugh rails, missed what he considers an easily predictable outcome. And that, he adds, ''is why we are in such a big mess now.''
 Mr. Hugh's demographic thesis is not airtight: in fact, it was Italy, not Greece, that attracted his early attacks.
 But Italy, perhaps because its overall debt level was already so high and its population was older, pursued a policy of greater fiscal rectitude than its neighbors and avoided a real estate bubble.
 And Mr. Hugh's main policy proposal -- that Germany leave the euro, which would almost immediately push the value of the currency down sharply, improving competitiveness for the weaker countries that remained behind -- reads better as a provocative blog post than as a practical solution.
 Still, the sudden vulnerability of the euro zone and the search far and wide for answers by policy makers, investors and economists have caused his once obscure ramblings to go viral.
 ''He is an information channel that I value a lot,'' said Brad DeLong, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, who was a United States Treasury official in the administration of President Bill Clinton and a prominent blogger in his own right.
 Mr. Hugh has also attracted a cult following among financial analysts.
 ''Edward was writing very clearly about the imbalances in Europe and the likelihood of a crisis long before it was even on the radar screen of economists or analysts,'' said Jonathan Tepper of Variant Perception, a London research firm that caters to hedge funds and wealthy investors. ''He is a thinking machine.''
 At the same time, Mr. Hugh is determined to resist some of the newfound temptations that have lately come his way. He said he had turned down lucrative offers from hedge funds to provide exclusive research because he did not want his views monopolized by any one entity -- although he said he was considering an offer to join the stable of contributors who work for Mr. Roubini.
 And when the Milken Institute -- financed by Michael Milken, a felon who managed to hang on to a fortune even after having to pay a $550 million fine for his actions during the junk-bond boom of the 1980s -- paid him $3,000 for a short report he did in a day on Eastern Europe, Mr. Hugh gave the money to a friend who was having trouble paying her mortgage, he said.
 ''I don't want to take a check from Michael Milken, thank you very much,'' he said.
 Born in Liverpool, Mr. Hugh studied at the London School of Economics but was drawn more to philosophy, science, sociology and literature. His eclectic intellectual pursuits kept him not only from getting his doctorate but also prevented him from landing a full-time professor's job.
 ''I was once described by my departmental professor as a 'thief' for accepting my doctoral grant while continuing to spend my time reading the books and attending the courses that I chose to read and that I chose to attend,'' he said.
 Seeing himself more as a European than an Englishman, he moved to Barcelona in 1990.
 His blog posts reflect his varied interests, often citing Bob Dylan, Charles Bukowski, Jean-Paul Sartre, Friedrich Nietzsche and even the sociable behavior of his beloved bonobos, the primate species that is the closest relative to humans in the animal kingdom.
 Mr. Hugh cultivates the pale and shabby look of someone who has spent 12 to 14 hours a day sitting in front of a computer for the last 10 years.
 But he is no recluse. His merry, convivial spirit and his religious adherence to the principles of reciprocity and exchange have made him a social networker par excellence. His embrace of the mores of Barcelona (he speaks fluent Catalan) has given him his own support network of middle-aged housewives as well, some of whom have provided him a place to live as he moves from abode to abode.
 He currently lives in a farmhouse in a village of 60 people in northern Spain, where he writes for a suite of blogs -- including A Fistful of Euros, Global Economy Matters and a number of country-specific blogs that focus on the Japanese, Hungarian, Latvian and Greek economies. More than anything, though, he still mostly reads and thinks. He also maintains a vibrant Facebook page
 ''In the Middle Ages, curiosity in excess was regarded as a sin,'' he said with yet another laugh. ''But with the Internet, I feel that I can do what I like. This makes me feel that I can really do something.''

HEADLINE: Israel Makes Case to China for Iran Sanctions

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS; Xiyun Yang contributed reporting from Beijing.

 BODY:
JERUSALEM -- During the many months China has wavered over whether to join the American-led effort to impose sanctions on Iran, Israeli officials have been waging their own quiet campaign to convince the Chinese that Iran should be punished for its renegade nuclear program.
 But unlike the United States, which has played on China's sense of responsibility as a member of the United Nations Security Council, Israeli officials have been making their case without diplomatic niceties.
 In February, a high-level Israeli delegation traveled to Beijing to present alleged evidence of Iran's atomic ambitions. Then they unveiled the ostensible purpose of their visit: to explain in sobering detail the economic impact to China from an Israeli strike on Iran -- an attack Israel has suggested is all but inevitable should the international community fail to stop Iran from assembling a nuclear weapon.
 ''The Chinese didn't seem too surprised by the evidence we showed them, but they really sat up in their chairs when we described what a pre-emptive attack would do to the region and on oil supplies they have come to depend on,'' said an Israeli official with knowledge of the meeting and who asked for anonymity so as not to upset his Chinese counterparts. 
 Whether the Israeli show-and-tell persuaded Beijing to join the proposed sanctions announced by the White House late last month may never be known. But the episode demonstrates how Israel -- a small country with limited influence on China -- has found ways to engage an emerging superpower whose geopolitical heft is increasingly vital to the Jewish state.
 Across the world, countries large and small have been seeking to gain the affections of China as its economic might and diplomatic swagger become harder to ignore. In recent years, Chad, Malawi and Costa Rica have switched their official allegiance to Beijing from China's longtime rival Taiwan. France, Germany and the United Kingdom frequently vie with one another to win trade deals with China, undermining the negotiating power of the European Union. And last December, 20 Uighur refugees who had sought United Nations protection in Cambodia were deported to China. The United States and human rights groups howled in protest; a day later, the Chinese vice president arrived in Cambodia with $1.2 billion in economic aid.
 Some countries have found they can engage China through gentle inducements. Norway has leveraged its influence as a bridge to NATO and though its seat on the Arctic Council, an international forum that China is eager to join. ''As a small state, we've been quite successful in engaging the Chinese on a number of issues where we have some strength,'' said Oystein Tunsjo, a research fellow at the Norwegian Institute for Defense Studies.
 Ties between Israel and China are collegial but Israeli officials have been working hard to regain Beijing's favor since a bungled arms deal in 2000 infuriated Chinese leaders. More recently, they have also had to compete against China's growing thirst for Middle East oil, which makes up half the country's petroleum imports. With its single-minded focus on securing the energy required for continued economic growth, Beijing has shifted some of its diplomatic ardor to the countries of the Middle East, some of which are Israel's sworn enemies.
 Alarmed by the shift, Israel has stepped up its soft-power diplomacy through academic, cultural and medical exchanges. ''Israel is not a great supplier of the kinds of natural resources that China can find among some of our neighbors but we do have a lot to offer them, and there is a strong sense of mutual respect,'' said Amos Nadai, the Israeli ambassador to Beijing.
 Israeli officials cite some commonalities: their histories as ancient civilizations and the transformative economic growth that has defied conventional wisdom and a yearning for regional stability. Although as vividly demonstrated in the crisis over last week's deadly commando raid on a flotilla of activists -- not to speak of Iran's nuclear program -- Israel is not afraid to threaten that stability in the face of an existential threat.
 When it comes to tangible goods, Israel sells China irrigation systems, high-tech products and telecommunications equipment. Trade between the two countries reached $4.5 billion last year, up from $3.8 billion in 2006, but three-fourths of that is Chinese exports to Israel.
 The imbalance would be less pronounced if not for the two-decade-old American-led embargo on arms sales to China that has stymied Israel's most lucrative export. In private, Israeli officials express frustration over the ban but they acknowledge that their relationship with Washington trumps the desire to do more business with China.
 Oddly enough, the close ties between Israel and the United States have become something of an Achilles' heel for the Jewish state. During the 1990s, when Beijing was diplomatically isolated after the violent crackdown on demonstrators in Tiananmen Square, the Chinese sought closer relations with Israel because they thought it might bring them closer to the United States. ''This was an illusory period during which China thought the Jewish and Israeli lobbies could open doors for them in Washington,'' said Yoram Evron, a research fellow at the Institute for National Security Studies.
 Israel's outsized allure also stemmed from China's regard for the country's military prowess and a deeply held affection for Karl Marx and Albert Einstein, cornerstones of a Chinese fascination with Jews.
 How much they value the relationship with the United States was underscored in 2000, when under American pressure Israel canceled a $1 billion arms deal, years in the making, to sell China an advanced airborne tracking system. Even though Israel later agreed to pay a $350 million penalty, the diplomatic damage was immense -- and then compounded in 2005, when Washington blocked another Israeli arms deal with Beijing involving drone aircraft.
 ''After that, the Chinese realized the Jewish lobby does not control the White House and they started to treat us like a younger brother of the United States,'' said Yitzhak Shichor, a professor of Asian Studies at Haifa University. ''We have been cut down to size. We may make a lot of noise, but we're the size of a medium-sized Chinese city.''
 During the first decades after Mao's Communist revolution, China's interests in the Middle East were largely tethered to ideology. The Chinese government saw itself as a standard-bearer for the developing world -- and a champion of the Palestinian cause. In the 1980s, when China began embracing economic reforms and a more pragmatic diplomatic strategy, China's approach to the minefield of Middle East politics involved greater equanimity -- and neutrality.
 But oil and soaring trade with the Arab states have helped shift the calculus. Last year, China surpassed the United States in exports to the Arab world. And while not a dominant factor in its foreign policy decisions, it is worth noting that China is home to more than 20 million Muslims, including a restive population of Turkic-speaking Uighurs in Xinjiang, a region that borders five predominantly Islamic countries.
 ''Chinese Muslims working as translators play a constructive role in the Middle East, which adds an extra dimension to China's relationship with the region,'' said Ben Simpfendorfer, the chief China economist at the Royal Bank of Scotland in Hong Kong. ''It's difficult for anyone to sit on the fence when it comes to the Middle East, and this is a challenge that China will increasingly face in the future.''
 Recent events provide some hint as to which way China might tilt. Last year, Beijing endorsed a report by the United Nations Human Rights Council that accused Israel of war crimes during its attack on the Gaza Strip. In recent months, the Chinese Foreign Ministry has repeatedly condemned Israeli construction in largely Arab neighborhoods of East Jerusalem. The vote and the condemnations are notable, given China's often stated aversion to measures that involve another country's internal affairs.
 In an assessment echoed by several other government-affiliated academics, Yin Gang, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Society Sciences in Beijing, said its interests in the Arab world would continue to drive Beijing's foreign policy. ''China will try to achieve a basic balance in the Middle East but Israel cannot give China much help on the international political stage,'' he said. ''The truth is, it is just a very small country.''

 ''It's quite nice, actually,'' Mr. Hugh, 61, said with amusement as he leaned back in a plush town car that was taking him to his latest speaking engagement organized by the Circulo de Economia, an influential business lobbying group in Barcelona. ''I am meeting all sorts of interesting people and they are paying me to have lunch with them.''
 But in other ways, his life has changed very little. Last week, in fact, he even had to borrow money from friends to buy clothes presentable enough to allow him to address the conference of Spanish politicians and business executives. He still mostly supports himself by teaching English to locals here, where he has lived for two decades.
 ''I guess I am countercyclical,'' he said with a laugh. ''For all the years during the boom when everyone was doing well here, I wasn't doing anything. Now I am a household name in Catalonia.''
 Well, not quite. The idea of the economist as a pop celebrity in the mold of a Nouriel Roubini, whose early prediction that the United States housing market would collapse later brought him fame and a worldwide consulting brand, or a Paul Krugman, the Nobel-winning economist who writes an Op-Ed Page column for The New York Times, is still unformed in Europe and in particular in Spain.
 But as questions rise over how European governments can escape their debt trap and resume growth, Mr. Hugh, who has been pondering this topic for years, is for the first time being turned to for insights and wisdom.
 His bleak message, in newspaper columns, local television and radio appearances, and in meetings with officials, is almost always the same: since Spain and other struggling countries of the euro zone like Greece, Portugal, Ireland and Italy cannot devalue their common currency unilaterally, they have little choice but to endure what would essentially be a 20 percent internal devaluation instead. That means their public and private sector wages need to fall by roughly that amount if those countries are ever to restore competitiveness, lift exports and bring in the cash needed to pay down their debts.
 ''Why haven't these countries converged'' with the rest of Europe? he asks. ''It's demographics. As populations age, there are fewer people in their 20s to 40s to buy new houses, so they save more. The younger a country is, the more dependent it is on credit to get growth.''
 Germany, where the average age is 45 and rising even as the population is beginning to shrink, is a nation of savers, and public policy has encouraged keeping wages under control and building up export industries.
 By contrast, the younger Greeks, Irish and Spaniards went on borrowing binges, driven in particular by rising demands for new homes and consumer goods that, in several cases, turned into housing bubbles before going bust. Wages were pushed up, encouraging spending but soon making it all but impossible for their industries to compete with the thrifty Germans, Dutch and other Northern Europeans.
 Most economists, beholden as they are to their ''promiscuous but essentially useless'' economic models, Mr. Hugh rails, missed what he considers an easily predictable outcome. And that, he adds, ''is why we are in such a big mess now.''
 Mr. Hugh's demographic thesis is not airtight: in fact, it was Italy, not Greece, that attracted his early attacks.
 But Italy, perhaps because its overall debt level was already so high and its population was older, pursued a policy of greater fiscal rectitude than its neighbors and avoided a real estate bubble.
 And Mr. Hugh's main policy proposal -- that Germany leave the euro, which would almost immediately push the value of the currency down sharply, improving competitiveness for the weaker countries that remained behind -- reads better as a provocative blog post than as a practical solution.
 Still, the sudden vulnerability of the euro zone and the search far and wide for answers by policy makers, investors and economists have caused his once obscure ramblings to go viral.
 ''He is an information channel that I value a lot,'' said Brad DeLong, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, who was a United States Treasury official in the administration of President Bill Clinton and a prominent blogger in his own right.
 Mr. Hugh has also attracted a cult following among financial analysts.
 ''Edward was writing very clearly about the imbalances in Europe and the likelihood of a crisis long before it was even on the radar screen of economists or analysts,'' said Jonathan Tepper of Variant Perception, a London research firm that caters to hedge funds and wealthy investors. ''He is a thinking machine.''
 At the same time, Mr. Hugh is determined to resist some of the newfound temptations that have lately come his way. He said he had turned down lucrative offers from hedge funds to provide exclusive research because he did not want his views monopolized by any one entity -- although he said he was considering an offer to join the stable of contributors who work for Mr. Roubini.
 And when the Milken Institute -- financed by Michael Milken, a felon who managed to hang on to a fortune even after having to pay a $550 million fine for his actions during the junk-bond boom of the 1980s -- paid him $3,000 for a short report he did in a day on Eastern Europe, Mr. Hugh gave the money to a friend who was having trouble paying her mortgage, he said.
 ''I don't want to take a check from Michael Milken, thank you very much,'' he said.
 Born in Liverpool, Mr. Hugh studied at the London School of Economics but was drawn more to philosophy, science, sociology and literature. His eclectic intellectual pursuits kept him not only from getting his doctorate but also prevented him from landing a full-time professor's job.
 ''I was once described by my departmental professor as a 'thief' for accepting my doctoral grant while continuing to spend my time reading the books and attending the courses that I chose to read and that I chose to attend,'' he said.
 Seeing himself more as a European than an Englishman, he moved to Barcelona in 1990.
 His blog posts reflect his varied interests, often citing Bob Dylan, Charles Bukowski, Jean-Paul Sartre, Friedrich Nietzsche and even the sociable behavior of his beloved bonobos, the primate species that is the closest relative to humans in the animal kingdom.
 Mr. Hugh cultivates the pale and shabby look of someone who has spent 12 to 14 hours a day sitting in front of a computer for the last 10 years.
 But he is no recluse. His merry, convivial spirit and his religious adherence to the principles of reciprocity and exchange have made him a social networker par excellence. His embrace of the mores of Barcelona (he speaks fluent Catalan) has given him his own support network of middle-aged housewives as well, some of whom have provided him a place to live as he moves from abode to abode.
 He currently lives in a farmhouse in a village of 60 people in northern Spain, where he writes for a suite of blogs -- including A Fistful of Euros, Global Economy Matters and a number of country-specific blogs that focus on the Japanese, Hungarian, Latvian and Greek economies. More than anything, though, he still mostly reads and thinks. He also maintains a vibrant Facebook page
 ''In the Middle Ages, curiosity in excess was regarded as a sin,'' he said with yet another laugh. ''But with the Internet, I feel that I can do what I like. This makes me feel that I can really do something.''

 BODY:
BARCELONA, Spain -- For years, almost nobody paid attention to the sky-is-falling alarms of Edward Hugh, a gregarious British blogger and self-taught economist who repeatedly predicted that the euro zone could not survive.
 Living a largely hand-to-mouth existence here on his part-time teacher's salary, he sent one post after another into the Internet wilderness. It was the height of policy folly, he warned, to think that aging, penny-pinching Germans could successfully coexist under one currency umbrella with the more youthful, credit-card-wielding Irish, Greeks and Spaniards who shared the euro with them.

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Wednesday about Edward Hugh, an economics blogger who has drawn attention for his misgivings about the future of the euro zone, misstated the name of a policy research organization that paid him for a short report on Eastern Europe. It is the Milken Institute, not the Michael Milken Institute.

HEADLINE: Legacy for One Billionaire: Death, but No Taxes

BYLINE: By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI

 BODY:
A Texas pipeline tycoon who died two months ago may become the first American billionaire allowed to pass his fortune to his children and grandchildren tax-free.
 Dan L. Duncan, a soft-spoken farm boy who started with $10,000 and two propane trucks, and built a network of natural gas processing plants and pipelines that made him the richest person in Houston, died in late March of a brain hemorrhage at 77.
 Had his life ended three months earlier, Mr. Duncan's riches -- Forbes magazine estimated his worth at $9 billion, ranking him as the 74th wealthiest in the world -- would have been subject to a federal tax of at least 45 percent. If he had lived past Jan. 1, 2011, the rate would be even higher -- 55 percent.
 Instead, because Congress allowed the tax to lapse for one year and gave all estates a free pass in 2010, Mr. Duncan's four children and four grandchildren stand to collect billions that in any other year would have gone to the Treasury. 
 The United States enacted an estate tax in 1916, and when John D. Rockefeller, America's first billionaire, died in 1937, his estate paid 70 percent. Since then, the rates have fluctuated, but this is the first time the tax has been repealed altogether.
 The bonanza in tax savings for Mr. Duncan's descendants is sure to be unsettling to those who have paid estate taxes on more modest wealth -- until Jan. 1 of this year, it applied to any estate valued at more than $3.5 million, taxing only the money exceeding that threshold, or $7 million for a couple's estate.
 Although the tax affects only about 5,500 estates a year, it is such an incendiary issue that when Congress unexpectedly let it lapse at the end of 2009, financial advisers warned that it might play a macabre factor in the end-of-life decisions being weighed by heirs of elderly Americans. Some estate lawyers worried that tax considerations might prompt their clients to keep an ill relative on life support through the end of 2009 to get the favorable treatment -- or worse, resist life-prolonging measures to hasten a relative's demise before the end of 2010.
 The one-year lapse in the estate tax was signed into law by President George W. Bush in 2001, an accounting quirk in his package of tax cuts. Although Democrats pledged to close that gap and reinstate a tax for 2010 when they took control of Congress, they failed to reach an agreement last December. The Senate Finance Committee is now trying to forge a compromise that would reinstate the tax, but even if that effort succeeds, it is unclear whether any changes might be retroactive and applied to those who have died so far in 2010.
 Many lawyers say Mr. Duncan's heirs have the means and motivation to wage a fierce court battle to challenge the constitutionality of any retroactive tax.
 Representatives of Mr. Duncan's family, his estate and his business interests did not return calls about the matter. Mr. Duncan's will, which is on file at the Harris County Probate Court in Houston, was written in 2006 and amended in 2008, a time when most estate planners assumed that Congress would not allow the tax to lapse. Federal law has long allowed an unlimited amount of assets to pass untaxed to a surviving spouse, and Mr. Duncan left his home and ranch to his wife of more than 20 years, Jan, along with stock valued at hundreds of millions of dollars.
 But the bulk of his estate is left to his children and grandchildren, and would have been taxable in 2009 or 2011.
 In addition to personal effects bequeathed to his descendants -- boats, jewelry, automobiles, shotguns and a 5,500-acre Texas hunting ranch stocked with wild game -- he passed on his holdings in EPCO and Dan Duncan L.L.P., two entities in the natural gas and pipeline empire he built. The stock involved includes more than 100 million shares in Enterprise GP Holdings, which closed at $43.23 the last trading day before Mr. Duncan died. That asset alone could have resulted in a $2 billion estate tax.
 The Treasury collected more than $25 billion in estate taxes in 2008, the most recent year for which data is available.
 Elaborate estate plans with sophisticated trusts are often made many years before death to reduce estate taxes owed by the richest.
 Advocates of the tax say it is unconscionable that Congressional leaders have allowed the richest Americans to reap a new tax break at a time when deficits are soaring and the income gap between wealthy and poor citizens remains near historic levels.
 ''The ultrawealthy in this country will still be able to pass on enormous wealth to the next generation,'' said Chuck Collins, who studies income inequality and has worked with billionaires like Warren E. Buffett and Bill Gates to promote an estate tax. Mr. Collins argues that the tax is a ''recycling program for economic opportunity.''
 But opponents, who label it a death tax, say it is unfair because it taxes the same income twice -- once when it is earned and again when it is passed on to heirs.
 Mr. Duncan's eldest daughter, Randa Duncan Williams, is serving as executor of the estate and is a voting member of the family trust that will now control her father's interest in Enterprise GP Holdings.
 Should the family trust sell these inherited shares, capital gains taxes would presumably be owed on the difference between Mr. Duncan's original cost, which could be quite low, and their market value when sold. Capital gains taxes are capped at 15 percent.
 Ms. Williams, who has served as a director and general partner at the family's energy businesses for years, was deeply involved in her father's philanthropic efforts and is expected to continue much of that charitable work.
 During his life, Mr. Duncan contributed to a wide assortment of wildlife foundations and community institutions like the Houston Zoo and Houston Museum of Science, and an assortment of medical institutions. The various medical centers at Baylor College of Medicine received more than $250 million from Mr. Duncan and his wife, with more than $100 million used to found the Dan L. Duncan Cancer Center.
 Mr. Duncan's will designates a handful of nonprofit groups and charitable foundations that will receive donations, all of which would have been tax-exempt even in years when the estate tax was in effect.
 An avid big game hunter -- Mr. Duncan has more than 500 entries in the Safari Club International record book for killing animals including polar bears, rhinoceroses, bighorn sheep, lions and elephants -- he made a $1 million donation in his will to the Shikar Safari Club International Foundation.
 The will also directs that any money or assets not otherwise specified for a relative or charity be deposited into two family charitable trusts, which can be used to donate to causes deemed worthy by his heirs.

HEADLINE: Questions After Political Unknown Wins

BYLINE: By ROBBIE BROWN

 BODY:
COLUMBIA, S.C -- South Carolina Democratic leaders were surprised Wednesday by the victory of a long-shot candidate for the United States Senate -- and appeared even more surprised by his reported criminal background. 
 The candidate, Alvin Greene, 32, an unemployed Army veteran, shocked observers on Tuesday by winning the primary election against Vic Rawl, a four-term state lawmaker. Either Democratic candidate would have most likely faced an uphill battle against the popular incumbent Republican, Senator Jim DeMint.
 But on Wednesday, The Associated Press reported that Mr. Greene had been arrested on charges of showing a college student lewd Internet photographs and talking about visiting her dorm room.
 The Associated Press said court records showed that Mr. Greene faces a felony charge that carries a maximum of five years in prison for the offenses. Mr. Greene could not be reached for comment.
 In a statement, the South Carolina Democratic Party chairwoman, Carol Fowler, called on Mr. Greene to withdraw from the race. 
 ''I did not do this lightly, as I believe strongly that the Democratic voters of this state have the right to select our nominee,'' she said. ''But this new information about Mr. Greene would certainly have affected the decisions of many of those voters.''
 As usual in primaries, a relatively small number of voters decided the election -- especially since South Carolina is a heavily Republican state. According to state election officials, 169,698 votes were cast for Senate candidates in the Democratic primary: 100,053 for Mr. Greene and 69,645 for Mr. Rawl. 
 In comparison, 411,706 votes were cast in the Republican Senate primary (421,256 votes were cast in the Republican primary for governor and 188,765 in the Democratic primary).

HEADLINE: Unlikely Fan of Afrobeat Pulled 'Fela!' to Broadway

BYLINE: By PATRICK HEALY

 BODY:
As a student at Phillips Exeter Academy in the mid-1960s Stephen Hendel found comfort in his old turntable, the kind that could stack six records at a time, his Paul Butterfields and Sonny Boy Williamsons. Out on campus you endured bullies by keeping your emotions in check, he believed. But lying on his bed, listening to blues and jazz and soul for hours on end, the teenager felt his first stirrings of excitement and rich imagination.
 ''From a young age I was very uptight, and music was the only way that I had an emotional life,'' said Mr. Hendel, the grandson of Eastern European immigrants who, through hard work, rose from working-class roots in New Haven. ''I would go into record stores and see what looked interesting, and there would be Duke Ellington and Ellas McDaniel and musicians who could feel. They taught me to feel.'' 
 Some 35 years later, having become a prominent commodities trader in New York, Mr. Hendel was scrolling through the music on Amazon.com when he came across an unfamiliar name: Fela Kuti, the Afrobeat artist. Mr. Hendel's love for transporting music took form with Kuti, whose dramatic life as an African nationalist -- embedded in the lyrics of his pulsing songs -- was so inspiring to Mr. Hendel that he said to his wife, Ruth, a theater producer, that they should find a way to bring his music to a wide audience.
 That endeavor -- a genial, low-key Jewish businessman from Larchmont, N.Y., championing a fiery, sexy, anticapitalist singer from Nigeria -- produced ''Fela!,'' the Broadway show that tied for the most Tony Award nominations this year, 11, and is a leading contender for best musical at the Tonys ceremony on Sunday night.
 And it has catapulted Mr. Hendel from joining his wife at her opening nights to shepherding an $11 million critically acclaimed musical of his own as lead producer, and planning Tony campaign strategy with his main ''Fela!'' partners, the investors Jay-Z and Will and Jada Pinkett Smith and the show's director and choreographer, Bill T. Jones.
 At a party he gave at the Palm in Midtown last month for scores of Tony voters and theater presenters nationwide, Mr. Hendel, 58, arrived well ahead of time to get ready to greet guests at the door. He posed a bit stiffly for a photos taken with iPhones, and he circled the room a few times to make sure everything was in order. At one point he noted that soft rock was playing in the background; he quickly borrowed a friend's iPod that had several Kuti songs and had them pumped over the sound system.
 ''This is it, Fela's music!'' he fairly shouted when the music changed. ''This is one of his most famous songs, 'Lady.' We tried but never found a way to get it into the show.''
 A half-hour later Jay-Z and his wife, Beyonce Knowles, and the Smiths had arrived, and Mr. Hendel at first had to fight his way through the crowd massing toward the celebrities. Once he made it into the V.I.P. area, he huddled with them to talk about the show and point out people in the restaurant who might be worth meeting. The celebrities, who, with their business partners, have put in $3 million, shook hands with several voters and presenters and smiled broadly for cameras.
 Mr. Smith said he was excited to be part of his first Broadway venture, and added that he was especially impressed with what a newcomer like Mr. Hendel had accomplished. 
 ''I'm new to Broadway work myself, and feel lucky to have found partners like Steve and Bill who are direct, down to earth, and just constantly enthralled by Fela Kuti's music,'' said Mr. Smith, who came on board after watching a taped performance of the 2008 Off Broadway production of ''Fela!'' At Jay-Z's suggestion Mr. Hendel had brought in the film crew in hopes of recruiting the Smiths as investors.
 The Hendels have contributed and raised the bulk of the $11 million capitalization. Mrs. Hendel, who has 24 Broadway production credits of her own, including the musical ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels'' and the play ''Metamorphoses,'' said that when her husband first asked her seven years ago if Kuti's music and story might work as a Broadway show, she said she was less certain of its potential than she was confident that Mr. Hendel could pull it off.
 ''Knowing Steve as well as I do, I just knew that he would eventually realize what he would be trying to accomplish,'' Mrs. Hendel said over dinner last month as a performance of ''Fela!'' played next door at the Eugene O'Neill Theater. ''He's just very determined and passionate about this music.''
 ''And crazy,'' Mr. Hendel volunteered between bites of salmon.
 ''I'm not going to say that for the record,'' said Mrs. Hendel, who began dating Mr. Hendel when they were teenagers; they've been married 33 years. ''But he's on the manic side. And he's what I would call a creative businessman. He has a good sense about art and a good sense about numbers.''
 A lawyer by training, Mr. Hendel spent 16 years as a commodities executive at Goldman Sachs. He left in 1996, long before the company found itself in the spotlight over its actions in the mortgage and credit crises. Mr. Hendel subsequently helped start Hess Energy Trading Company, a private, international commodities business where he is a managing director. He would not talk about his work there.
 Yet Mr. Hendel's business background would present an evident contrast to any audience member of ''Fela!'' watching scenes in which the title character -- an outspoken advocate for Africa's poor -- criticizes Western energy companies and corporate interests as exploitative. But Mr. Hendel said his professional background only deepened his appreciation for Kuti.
 ''Over the years I've learned a great deal about how financial markets can help some economies but leave others behind,'' Mr. Hendel said. ''Through my adult life I've been concerned with scenes of suffering, of poverty. And no one anywhere has been more passionate about theses matters than Fela Kuti, and he expressed it through music. How incredible is that.''
 After discovering Kuti on Amazon and then spending a couple of years telling everyone he knew that Kuti was the most important musician they had never heard of, Mr. Hendel arranged a meeting with Mr. Jones to talk about developing a show, perhaps a dance piece or a production for festivals. Mr. Hendel started coming to Mr. Jones's house, sometimes clutching Kuti CDs to share. Mr. Jones began periodically holding workshops, largely paid for by Mr. Hendel, to create numbers with dancers and musicians; there was never much of a permanent script, a point that some critics of the show's loose story have noted.
 Mr. Jones described Mr. Hendel as ''a rarity on Broadway, a totally straightforward honest broker.'' As excitable as Mr. Hendel becomes whenever he talks about Kuti's music, he is also prone to anxiety about the show's fate. Ticket sales since the opening in November have been good some weeks, quite modest in others. 
 Based on interviews with several Tony voters, ''Fela!'' faces tough competition from ''Memphis'' for the best musical award, an honor that Mr. Hendel considers essential for raising the show's profile among tourists as well as reinforcing its appeal ''to audience members of all races, including some who might see this as a so-called black show rather than what it is, a human show.''
 Speaking with one Tony voter or road presenter after another at the Palm, though, Mr. Hendel demonstrated a deft touch at the art of awards season campaigning. He listened more than he talked, and when he did offer a few words, they were about his lifelong love for music that could change lives, like his own.
 When Joan Squires, president of Omaha Performing Arts, a road organization, said to Mr. Hendel that '' 'Fela!' isn't bad for your first musical,'' the look on his face was almost bittersweet.
 ''This music has meant so much to me,'' he said. ''Fortunately or unfortunately, I'll never have a show like this again.''

HEADLINE: For Sale? Yes, No, Maybe

BYLINE: By PENELOPE GREEN

 BODY:
DURING the residential real estate boom, in the seller's market that once was -- do you remember it? -- the wildly high returns and the low inventory meant snap decisions and swifter deals. There was no dithering, no backing out; no room, really, for second or third thoughts. There were attendant stresses and ruts along the path to selling a home or buying one. But more often than not, a deal was done, for better or worse.
 Today, with credit unfrozen and prices still low, some home sellers and shoppers are having a change of heart, in many cases at the 11th hour -- a course swivel that stuns all involved.
 It might look like a failure to launch or an inability to pull the trigger. But as houses and apartments have become ''homes'' again, as opposed to ''real estate,'' all the complicated and powerful feelings people associate with their homes -- ''the place you store your memories,'' as Kit Yarrow, professor of psychology and business at Golden Gate University put it -- have space again to bloom and, sometimes, entangle. 
 Late last spring, Robert J. Russell, a real estate agent with his own firm in the Dallas area, was caught off guard by the phone call, the terse and embarrassed communication between seller and broker when said seller is about to unspool a deal. Mr. Russell, who lists properties with Realtor.com, had negotiated a full-price offer of $240,000 for a red brick two-story house belonging to a couple in suburban Dallas. All were poised to sign, he said, when the wife called to say she and her husband had cold feet. ''The buyers couldn't understand because I had no information from the sellers,'' Mr. Russell said, noting that he asked if there had been a job or lifestyle change. ''I can only assume that they either got scared or they were testing the market.'' 
 Around the same time, Jed Schwartz made a similar call to his broker, Lisa Conway, a senior vice president at Halstead in Manhattan. As he tells it, Mr. Schwartz, an information technology manager, and his wife, Lee, a retired teacher, had arrived at a familiar turning point: their daughter was at college, and they thought it might be time to shake the tree a bit.
 They'd been living in their Greenwich Village apartment for over 20 years and had the clutter to show for it. What would it feel like to live somewhere else? They had a place in the Berkshires, and a new home on the Upper West Side would shorten that commute. They had always loved Park Slope, Brooklyn, and perhaps they could have more space there. ''We were sort of opening our minds,'' Mr. Schwartz said. 
 When they met with Ms. Conway, she said she couldn't list the 925-square-foot two-bedroom apartment until it had been redone: the wall-to-wall carpeting ripped up; the floors refinished; the walls painted a crisp white. ''It was like Victorian meets early hippie,'' Ms. Conway said. ''It needed to be updated.''
 She worked hard to stage the place, shopping with Ms. Schwartz at the Door Store, directing that a sectional couch be cut in half, that the Schwartzes prune their belongings way down. And when they were finished, all three agreed that the place looked wonderful. In mid-May, Ms. Conway listed the apartment for $879,000; last week, when she called to schedule an open house, Mr. Schwartz said that he and his wife had decided to stay. 
 ''We thought we needed a broker,'' Mr. Schwartz said. ''We just needed a decorator.'' 
 Ms. Conway added: ''I did too good a job.''
 A month earlier, and farther uptown, Cornelius Dufallo and Amy Kauffman, concert violinists with a 3-year-old daughter, had been ready to sign a contract for the sale of their bright two-bedroom apartment on the Upper West Side when they, too, had a change of heart. Their broker, Francisco Menendez, a vice president for sales at Barak Realty, had brought in a professional stager who recommended accent pillows, rearranging furniture, that sort of thing. And they had committed buyers, a couple eager to take advantage of the $8,000 stimulus tax break that expired April 30. But, Mr. Dufallo said: ''We panicked. We just realized we were about to throw away a really good thing.'' 
 Dr. Yarrow, who studies consumer behavior, called the reactions ''wedding jitters,'' explaining the push-me pull-you effect of a squirrelly economy. ''People are making long-term commitments, and they have limited vision into the future,'' she said. ''That's what the market is giving us right now. Fear of loss is super powerful to consumers -- that fear of losing your house, or your money, is keeping them jittery a lot longer. It makes sense that people will think a lot longer about selling their house, even pulling out at the last minute.'' 
 By the end of last year, Amy Rea, an associate at Halstead, had four deals evaporate when the sellers (all, coincidentally, single parents with small children, three in the same Upper West Side building) realized that the homes they were in, while small, were just fine, thank you. Unfortunately, it took the process of preparing their apartments for sale for these owners to realize that the value of their homes wasn't just monetary. (In the case of one woman Ms. Rea represented on the Upper East Side, there was a full video tour, weeks of advertising and the attendant costs, in the thousands of dollars, and an accepted offer.) 
 ''It wasn't so much the market, but the economy,'' Ms. Rea said, indicating that in each case, the single parent felt pinched by work and family responsibilities, ''each one in the end figuring that there's no place like home.'' She added: ''What are you going to do? I wanted each one to be happy. After all, I'm a single parent, too.'' 
 The woman on the Upper East Side, Ms. Rea said, was living in a one-bedroom apartment with a 2-year-old and planning to move to a bigger space in a different neighborhood. She accepted an offer that was $35,000 below the asking price of $525,000, but before the contract was signed, she called Ms. Rea to say she had changed her mind. ''It was a very short phone call,'' said Ms. Rea, who learned the full story behind the decision days later. ''I think she realized her job was a dead end, and that she would have to go back to school. Better to size down and suck it in and stay where she was comfortable, and in a good school district.'' 
 Ms. Rea is philosophical. ''You have to be,'' she said, noting that in 5 years of sales (and 11 years in the business), she had never had a deal unravel before last year. 
 What really makes brokers crazy, though, are the shoppers who never pull the trigger -- and, by all accounts, they have been out in droves over the last 12 months. Social psychologists have shown that too much choice can paralyze a consumer. Certainly, the flood of inventory in the last year, the low prices and the low-interest rates have created a Chinese menu effect of too many options that can cause some would-be buyers to freeze. 
 Or make them slightly crazy. Mr. Russell, the Dallas-area agent, recalled the case of a newly divorced female client who went in and out of contract on seven houses. A standard clause in purchase and sale agreements in Texas allows a buyer ''to pull out within the termination-option period'' -- typically 7 to 10 days -- '' for any or no reason at all,'' Mr. Russell said. 
 He continued: ''Just imagine, we look at 10 houses, 20 houses, and then she says, 'Robert, I've found it, let's make an offer.' And we go back and forth with the seller, 'We can't close this day, it's got to be that day, we can't do this, please fix that.' Now imagine that scenario seven times.''
 How did he get to seven? 
 ''Well, I'm not going to give up on people,'' said Mr. Russell, who like most real estate agents is something of a fatalist.
 Ultimately, he did. ''I told her, 'You're not serious about buying a house or you would have bought one of the first seven.' She said, 'Why don't you think I'm serious?' I said, 'No one makes an offer on seven houses and backs out. If you're not sure, don't make an offer.' ''
 Her answer, he recalled, was a plaintive ''but I've liked every house we made an offer on.''
 He added: ''That's when I got my gray hairs.''
 Paradoxically, the $8,000 tax credit has confounded many would-be buyers. In March, Tom Thornton, a real estate agent in Austin, Tex., was contacted by two different 30-year-old male shoppers drawn into the market by the tax credit, but who stopped their search right before it expired.
 ''Each had six weeks on the clock, and one wrote two different offers before pulling out,'' he said. ''I think the perfect storm of low interest rates, the bumping on the bottom of prices and the tax credit brought out a lot of first-time buyers who weren't quite ready mentally or financially but felt like they had to make a move.''
 Mr. Thornton added, ''I heard from both of them later that they had some fear of loss -- financial loss, but loss of freedom, too.''
 Pity Maria Picardi-Kenyon, a RE/MAX agent in Mercer County, N.J., who showed 68 houses in the low $100,000 range to a couple who were galvanized by the tax credit. ''They were on the deadline, and at the last minute we found them the perfect home,'' Ms. Picardi-Kenyon said. ''Then they decided they didn't want to be pressured into buying because of the tax credit. They didn't want to be forced to buy! I burned more in gasoline than I would have earned in commission.''
 Ms. Picardi-Kenyon said the couple wanted to keep shopping with her, but she delivered what she calls ''the talk.''
 ''I told them we'd come to the end of our relationship,'' she said. ''I wished them the best and walked away. They still e-mail me, and I don't respond. It's all about tough love.'' 
 In Moorestown, N.J., Arleen Shabel, an artist, is practicing tough love on her husband of 48 years by gearing up to put their house on the market next month for a third time.
 She recalled the second time she and her husband, Norman, a lawyer and a writer of thrillers, listed their house about a year ago. During a showing to a ''very interested'' prospect, Mr. Shabel ran to pull the ''For Sale'' sign from the lawn.
 ''We've been here for 23 years and it is our dream home,'' Ms. Shabel said, describing a 7,000-square-foot house they designed themselves. ''So it's hard for him. But next month, if I can get it decluttered, it will go on the market for a third time. And if he backs out, I think I will kill him.''

HEADLINE: How Can We Fix Medicare Payments?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''The Doctor Payment Follies'' (editorial, June 6):
 Absurd is the perfect word for the current Medicare physician payment system. A 21 percent cut will devastate health care for the elderly and baby boomers entering Medicare.
 Medicare payment hasn't changed with the transformation in patient care. More is being done in physician offices to care for patients and keep them out of the hospital, which saves money and is better for people. 
 Savings accrue to the overall Medicare system, but physicians are penalized for doing more to keep patients healthy under the current payment formula, which cuts individual physician payments as the national volume of physician services increases. Individual physicians provide services based on the needs of the patient in front of them -- not on an obscure national formula.
 Congressional actions have delayed the cut, but put the bill on a government credit card -- making the ultimate cost exponentially higher. Congress needs to replace the formula, pay the tab and protect Medicare for the elderly.

 To the Editor:
 Doctors spend almost as much time on the subtleties of billing codes as we do on patient care. Primary care in particular is adversely affected by a fee-for-service system that stifles innovative approaches to managing complex chronic and preventive care in favor of those services insurance companies and Medicare will reimburse. A fee for every conceivable new idea simply drives up office and insurance overhead.
 Many successful integrated health systems like Kaiser Health Systems have understood for decades that paying generalists an adequate base salary with incentives for quality positively affects both physician performance and cost.
 A change in the piecework culture of medicine will take time, but why not start with primary care? Reimburse us for practice populations rather than individual services, and reward creative ideas that improve the health of patients and communities, not just the billable ones.

 To the Editor:
 You applaud Congress's refusal to cut Medicare reimbursements to doctors, because that would disastrously cause them to drop Medicare patients. Then you note, without a hint of irony, ''there could be problems with ... one key element of the new health care reform law.''
 That's putting it mildly.
 Only six months ago, Democratic leaders told us to count on such Medicare cuts for almost half the nearly $1 trillion needed to pay for the expansion of government-subsidized health care to the middle class. Now, as Democrats refuse to make those Medicare cuts yet again, it's clear that their plan all along was to buy votes with a vast new entitlement for middle-aged baby boomers, pretend to pay for it with cuts to Medicare, but actually just leave the bill behind to be paid by our children.
 Here is the heart of Tea Party outrage. With luck, voters this November will consign these cynical career politicians to the fate they so richly deserve: joining the swelling ranks of the permanently unemployed.
 Tom Adams Carmel Valley, Calif., June 6, 2010
 To the Editor:
 Physician reimbursement for Medicare patient services has been a festering problem for many years. As has been the habit, Congress steps in at the 11th hour and supplies a ''doctor fix.''
 In your editorial you advocate replacing unfettered fee-for-service payments because they encourage doctors to perform unnecessary and costly tests and procedures. Not only do you unfairly smear all of us with this crowd-pleasing canard, but you do not discuss anywhere in your editorial that most unnecessary costs are occasioned by fear of unwarranted medical malpractice litigation, not by the next payment on our yacht.
 Although retired from the wars, I still bristle when the dialectic focuses on the sideshow instead of lancing the real boil.
 Paul Bloustein Cincinnati, June 6, 2010
 The writer is a doctor.
 To the Editor:
 I am writing from the front lines of medical care to the elderly population of our country. Your editorial regarding the tremendous flaws in the Medicare physician payment system is mostly on point, but doesn't address the major problem.
 When Medicare was enacted in 1965, the calculations about its future costs and ways to finance it took into account then-existing life expectancy and technology. CT scans, M.R.I. scans, PET scans, the wonders of modern surgery and pharmacological treatments for cancer, macular degeneration and many other illnesses were not even imagined. People were expected to live to age 75 or 80. Modern medicine has been amazingly successful in extending that to 95 and beyond.
 Our society needs to decide, at the grass-roots level and not by its ''elected representatives,'' whether we choose to finance all this care for our esteemed and revered elders in a new way, perhaps by a national value-added tax, or to ration and limit this care, which would run totally against our core moral values.

HEADLINE: Disney Says It Will Close 5 ESPN Zone Restaurants

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
The Walt Disney Company is closing five ESPN Zone restaurants, saying the economics of the business became too challenging.
 Locations in Baltimore, Chicago, Las Vegas, New York and Washington will close June 16, ESPN said Wednesday. The cable sports network is controlled by Disney. 
 ESPN Zone is a sports-themed restaurant chain started 12 years ago by Disney. It will stay open in Los Angeles and Anaheim, Calif., where the restaurants are run by Anschutz Entertainment Group and Zone Enterprises, ESPN said.
 ''This was a very difficult decision to make'' Rick Alessandri, senior vice president at the cable sports network, said in an interview. ''But it was the right decision to make.'' 
 Each restaurant was split into three sections, according to Disney regulatory filings: a ''studio grill'' for dining, a ''screening room'' for watching ESPN sports coverage and a ''sports arena'' for playing interactive games.
 The restaurants averaged about 30,000 square feet, large by industry standards, Mr. Alessandri said. The 50,000-square-foot location in Times Square was the biggest, and the restaurant in Baltimore was the chain's first, he said. Disney is opening a retail store in Times Square.
 ESPN would not release revenue or other financial information about the chain.
 Shares of Disney, based in Burbank, Calif., fell 21 cents, to $32.94.

HEADLINE: New Life for Unsold Antiques

BYLINE: By SCOTT BALDINGER

 BODY:
Economic turmoil has taken a toll on antiques dealers, including those in Hudson, N.Y., the antiques retailing center two hours north of New York City. But a handful of store owners have taken advantage of the slump, using unsold stock as raw material for work that blurs the line between decorative objects and art. 
 Mark Wasserbach welds tractor-tire casings, machine-press springs, furniture and lamp parts into Duchamp-like sculptures ($1,600 to $2,800 each), left, which he sells at Mark's Antiques (612 Warren Street; 518-701-5382). Gail Peachin, of Fern (610 1/2 Warren Street; 518-828-2886), acquired so many black-and-white photo albums that she cut and pasted the images into framed collages with an appealingly macabre vibe ($25 per image). Barry Judd, of Hedstrom & Judd (401 Warren Street; 518-671-6131), makes placemats from copies of 18th- and 19th-century ornithological and botanical prints (about $10 each). ''It's difficult nowadays to survive just on the traditional retail, so we're always looking for inventive, creative product that no one else has,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Legal and Illegal Vans Fight It Out for Fares

BYLINE: By FERNANDA SANTOS

 BODY:
Anthony Henry's commuter van rolled west along Merrick Boulevard in Queens, packed nearly to capacity with nine passengers. It was 6:50 on a Friday morning, and the path ahead of him was clear until suddenly it wasn't: A van with a wobbly left rear tire, illegally plying the same route, burst in from a side street and barely cleared a car parked at the corner to pull ahead of Mr. Henry. 
 ''Look at this guy right there, picking up my passengers,'' Mr. Henry, 47, said, clicking his tongue as the van swooped to the curb and scooped up two people waiting. ''It's a war out there.''
 War is an overstatement, but it is certainly ugly: tires slashed, windshields shattered, fists thrown, insults hurled and rules ignored as drivers across Queens and Brooklyn fight over fares. 
 Battlefield tales abound. 
 David Clarke was driving along 147th Avenue in Rosedale, Queens, on a recent Monday when, he said, an unlicensed van cut him off as he was about to pick up a passenger. When he got out to confront him, the driver said, ''Watch out, I know where you live,'' Mr. Clarke, 42, said. 
 Three days later, he said, his van was stolen outside his home in Ozone Park. The police found it close by, scratched and missing its side-view mirrors and tire rims.
 Another driver, John David, recalled getting into a heated argument with the driver of an unlicensed van who twice bumped into his van as he stopped at red lights along Linden Boulevard in St. Albans, Queens. The next day, Mr. David, 41, woke up to find the van's windshield and front windows on the driver and passenger sides smashed. ''It was retaliation, for sure,'' he said.
 Commuter vans are a familiar sight in many city neighborhoods, linking parts of Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx not served by subway lines to subway stations and also to the financial district in Manhattan and to a large mall in Nassau County. The routes, which are defined by the city's Transportation Department, are meant to supplement the public transit system, not compete with it, though that is not always the case. 
 There are nearly 300 van drivers in New York who abide by the rules, paying thousands of dollars a year in licensing fees and insurance. They are outnumbered by hundreds of drivers who work the same routes, but have no permits and no insurance, and whose numbers have increased as the economy has soured.
 Beyond a financial threat, their legal competitors say the unlicensed van drivers are a growing safety menace. ''They'll run red lights, they'll drive against traffic, they'll cut you off,'' said Gregory McDonald, 43, who has been a licensed van driver in Queens for 12 years.
 Gladstone Barrett, who is 60 and has raised three daughters on the money he earns from driving a licensed van, put it this way: ''I'm scared as hell. They say we're trying to get rid of them, but we're not trying to get rid of them. We just want them to follow the same requirements that we do.'' 
 For 16 years, Norman Morris did. He had a commercial driver's license and a hack license, both of which are required to drive a commuter van. His van had a safety inspection every six months and an emissions inspection every two years. He had a sticker from the Taxi and Limousine Commission, which regulates commuter vans, and carried passenger liability insurance. In all, he paid about $12,000 a year. 
 But then Mr. Morris decided the price was too high. ''The legal guys, they have a point,'' he said as his van approached the Jamaica Center bus and subway station on a recent Tuesday morning, carrying eight passengers. ''I wanted to be licensed, too, but I just can't afford it.'' 
 Sulaiman Haqq, an owner of Brooklyn Van Lines, a company licensed to operate along Flatbush Avenue, perhaps the busiest commuter van corridor in the city, said confrontations among van drivers were becoming more frequent and more violent. Legal and illegal van drivers usually know one another in their small, mostly Caribbean community, and it is not hard to find a way to retaliate, he explained. 
 ''When one of our drivers complains to the police, these guys come around and mess up his van,'' said Mr. Haqq, who is also president of the Brooklyn Van Industry Association, an umbrella group. ''They know who you are.'' 
 City Councilman Leroy G. Comrie Jr., whose district in southeastern Queens is served largely by commuter vans, is pressuring the city to go after unlicensed vans more aggressively. Though the Taxi and Limousine Commission and the police conduct occasional sweeps, their efforts have not made much difference, Mr. Comrie said.
 ''The thing is, these legal drivers are being outmaneuvered by people that are not participating in the cost of doing business, but only reaping the benefits of doing business,'' he said. 
 David Yassky, the city's taxi and limousine commissioner, says the need for van service is undeniable, particularly in neighborhoods where public transportation is scant and at a time when the Metropolitan Transportation Authority is cutting bus service. 
 ''We shouldn't be trying to suppress a market that's giving people a service they genuinely need,'' Mr. Yassky said. ''But that all depends on people playing by the rules and our ability to force people to play by the rules.'' 
 The resources to do that are limited. The commission has 120 officers to enforce regulations that cover not only commuter vans but also 26,000 livery cars and more than 13,200 yellow cabs. The Police Department has about 50 officers whose jobs include helping enforce the rules. 
 The commuter van industry grew out of the 11-day public transit strike in 1980, when mostly Caribbean immigrants started driving vans along or near bus routes. The service evolved into a shadow mass transportation system that looks much like those many of the drivers and passengers were used to in countries like Jamaica, Haiti, Guyana and Barbados. 
 As the number of vans increased, the Transport Workers Union, wary of competition for public buses, pressured the City Council to clamp down on the vans. The Council passed tough regulations in 1994 that made it significantly harder and more expensive for drivers to license their vans. 
 Drivers are required to keep lists of every passenger they transport and are barred from following the same paths as buses. Instead, the vans can travel only within certain zones and pick up passengers whose trips are prearranged -- mandates no one seems to follow. 
 Still, the higher cost of doing business, licensed drivers say, fed the chaos that rules on the streets today. 
 A typical situation unfolds at the beginning of a route in Queens near the corner of Linden Boulevard and 234th Street in Cambria Heights. Unlicensed vans routinely line up and pick up passengers, leaving in five-minute intervals just like the licensed ones. Others wait a block ahead and pull out as a licensed van leaves the base, grabbing commuters along the way. 
 ''We don't have to tell the renegades they're wrong. They know they're wrong,'' said Michael Williams, 52, a licensed van driver who works along Linden Boulevard. ''They just keep on doing it because no one is there to stop them.''
 When officers do show up on the streets and set up checkpoints, word tends to spread fast among the unlicensed drivers, who promptly disappear, licensed drivers say. 
 They also complain about being unfairly cited by the police at checkpoints, forcing them to spend hours in court rather than working the streets. 
 Income depends on how many days and hours a driver spends on the road, with the morning rush being particularly lucrative -- one driver said he makes about $40,000 a year. The legal vans transport about 15,000 people a day, according to fleet operators, and charge $2 a ride, compared with $2.25 for a single ride on a city bus. 
 Vans are generally faster than buses because they make fewer stops, and they tend to show up more often, which pleases people like Sandra Armstrong. She catches Mr. Henry's 4:15 a.m. van out of Laurelton, Queens -- the first leg of a trip to make it to New Jersey by 7:30 a.m., where she works as a toll collector.
 ''It wouldn't be safe for me to stand at the bus stop alone at this time of the day, waiting for the bus,'' Ms. Armstrong, 36, said as she settled onto a seat in the front. 
 Mr. Henry's early run has created a small community among passengers like Ms. Armstrong; Yvonne Walters, 51, a nurse at Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan; and Michelle Norman, 41, a barista at a Starbucks in Rockefeller Center. They greet one another as they file in, find something to talk about and share successes and setbacks. 
 When Mr. Henry's father died two years ago, many of his passengers attended the wake. When Ms. Armstrong celebrated her birthday in March, Mr. Henry was among her guests.
 ''We're just trying to offer a good service and make a living,'' Mr. Henry said. ''An honest living.''

HEADLINE: A Fragrant Harvest

BYLINE: By MICHAEL TORTORELLO

 BODY:
AT some point, nearly every gardener has paused over a flower and experienced an epiphany: If I could capture the scent of that jasmine in a bottle, I'd be a millionaire. The next day the petals are gone, and the aroma with them.
 Thanks for the memories. See you next year.
 Andrine Olson, however, has a pickle jar in her refrigerator that holds the invigorating scent of jasmine blossoms from her overgrown garden. There are some 60 other scents, too, foraged and assembled from her yard on Vashon Island, Wash., overlooking the Puget Sound.
 These tinctures are a highlight of Ms. Olson's creations as a natural perfumer, making scents without any of the synthetic aromas used in commercial perfumery. Each solution comes from a laborious process of steeping plants in 190-proof alcohol, a drink that could drop a horse. Other flowers have been pressed into fats, like palm oil shortening, in an old-fangled process called enfleurage. 
 There's a witch hazel tincture from the herb garden that smells curiously sweet, nothing like the drugstore astringents used to punish teenagers with spotty skin. A tincture of smoked clamshells, gathered from the seashore down the hill, recalls a pot of Lapsang Souchong tea. Or the smell of a lover's T-shirt after a bonfire on the beach. Creating perfumes, soaps and deodorants from her four-acre grounds has not made Ms. Olson a millionaire. Or a thousandaire, for that matter. Which is too bad, because Ms. Olson, 47, left her career as a Seattle technical writer for the likes of Boeing and Microsoft, and she has started to worry about losing her home to foreclosure.
 Frankly, she wouldn't mind selling the house, a 1,000-square-foot, ''Band-Aid-pink modular home'' that she has come to think of as a beached houseboat. She'd had a mind to scrap it after she moved to Vashon Island nine years ago. But first her library of antiquarian books took over the second bedroom, and then her perfuming kit colonized the kitchen. The house put down roots, and these days she lacks the energy to dislodge it.
 At the end of 2005, Ms. Olson suffered ''a massive'' heart attack -- a blockage of the left anterior descending artery that doctors called ''a widow-maker,'' she said. She survived and decided that ''it was time to do something different.''
 Since she took up natural perfuming, Ms. Olson has discovered a fervent community of other souls exploring the craft. One of her mentors, Anya McCoy, 59, sells her original scents under the name Anya's Garden (anyasgarden.com), and runs a Yahoo group devoted to natural perfuming. The subscription list has more than tripled since 2005, Ms. McCoy said, and currently numbers almost 2,000 members.
 The great majority of these perfumers buy all their ingredients from natural scent companies, in stores or on the Web, and then blend them at home. But Ms. McCoy also uses a heady variety of homegrown scents from her lush garden in Miami Shores, Fla., a village just north of Miami.
 The desire to smell good -- without the aura of chemicals -- did not seem to wane in the flop sweat of the recent economic panic. Ms. McCoy sells her creations at $60 to $125 for a half-ounce -- not cheap. Yet ''since 2007, I'd say my sales have increased 25 percent every year,'' she said.
 Mandy Aftel, who helped spur the modern natural perfumery movement with her 2001 book ''Essence and Alchemy,'' said she has ''observed an absolute explosion of interest.''
 ''I'm an artisan, though,'' she added, referring to her perfume line, Aftelier. ''So an explosion for me isn't like an explosion for Macy's!''
 Ms. Aftel, 62, connects the popularity of natural perfumes to interest in organic gardening and local food. ''People are so often in front of their computer screens and detached from the sensual world,'' she said.
 Synthetic perfumes do a poor job of awakening that connection to green things, according to some natural perfumers. They argue that commercial perfumes can have all the subtlety of the men's room at Yankee Stadium. And that synthetic fragrances cling indelibly to the body for 12 hours or more, like a one-night stand who demands brunch the next morning.
 Jeanne Rose, 73, a natural perfumer and aromatherapy practitioner in San Francisco who has written on the subject since 1969, puts it this way: ''People are walking around in our Chinatown who smell like fermented watermelons.''
 Ms. Rose, who teaches classes nationally, and out of her four-story Edwardian home, said the students who enroll do so because ''they think people stink.''
 That opinion may seem fragrant, but Ms. Rose's spring series of courses on tincturing, distillation and perfuming has been fully subscribed for several years now. She recently added classes in June and October to accommodate more students.
 Conventional perfumers, it should be said, would not agree that they are mired in stench. ''In the '80s, perfumes were very potent, over-the-top and long-lasting,'' said Mary Ellen Lapsansky, vice president of the Fragrance Foundation, a nonprofit education and trade group in New York. Unlike the commercial perfumes of yesteryear, today's versions are ''not so in-your-face,'' she said.
 MS. McCOY, of Anya's Garden, heads a trade group called the Natural Perfumers Guild. She creates custom scents for hotel cosmetics and teaches natural perfuming online. But the inspiration for her work lives outside in the garden.
 Before she started creating natural body products in the early '90s, Ms. McCoy trained and worked in landscape architecture and urban design. ''I've turned every inch of my house lot in Miami into a fragrant production area,'' she said.
 One of the first plants to greet visitors by the front walk is a rare 15-foot-tall Chinese perfume tree. ''It has the tiniest flowers you have ever seen,'' Ms. McCoy said, ''about the size of a match head.'' Gathering these yellow blooms, by her account, sounds like it's about as much fun as picking cat hair off an angora sweater. But the bouquet is peerless: a little ''like whole warm uncut lemon,'' she said.
 There's plenty of actual citrus growing, too. The star attractions of Kaffir, a 2008 perfume, are tinctures from the leaves and fruit of a Kaffir lime tree. The supporting cast includes tinctures from eight uncommon jasmines. Two of these shrubs pour over the 30-foot-long fence in the backyard, like chest hair on a '70s sex symbol that cannot be kept under the collar.
 ''My neighbors are used to seeing me out there harvesting any time from 8 in the morning until midnight,'' Ms. McCoy said. She works on the blossom's clock, whenever the bouquet is strongest, but sees it not as obsessive labor but as a kind of ''artistic curiosity.''
 Where else but in her own garden will she find the pure, unadulterated aroma of Michelia champaca or plumeria? The enfleurage she has made out of her plumerias ''smells extraordinary,'' she said. ''Better than anything you can buy from a supplier.''
 Making jojoba oil infusions out of her flower beds is partly a matter of thrift for Diana Burrell-Shipton, a 47-year-old ''work-at-home mom'' in Hubbard, Ohio, on the outskirts of Youngstown. An ounce of wild lavender essential oil, for instance, might cost more than $20 from an Internet catalog. And a common perfuming aroma like orris butter, made from the iris rhizome, costs $200 for just a quarter-ounce.
 ''I had no extra money to be buying the organic infusions even if I could find them,'' she wrote in an e-mail message. She prefers to know the origin of all her ingredients, anyway.
 Ms. Burrell-Shipton has tired of seeing '' 'all-natural' or 'organic' claims on the front of the label,'' she wrote, ''only to turn the product over and discover the real ingredients by reading the whole label.'' And she said she is suspicious of any ''faceless company, who has the main goal of making money.''
 True to those beliefs, Ms. Burrell-Shipton doesn't charge enough to turn a profit on the solid perfumes and sewn handicrafts that she makes in a 1973 Coachmen travel trailer and sells online (at organicgiftsbydiana.mybisi.com). Her workshop is parked behind an 1825 homestead that once belonged to her grandmother. She lives there on an acre of land with her husband and two daughters.
 In economic terms, this is a captive market. Where else is her family going to buy natural perfumes? But her household is also well served. Her 12-year-old, Elaina, said that she wears her garden-grown lavender balm to relax before a big exam or a choral concert.
 Ms. Burrell-Shipton's mother, meanwhile, has her own custom blend of plum- and peach-peel infusions from the yard. It's a source of comfort, she said, as her mother copes with Stage 4 cancer.
 Natural perfuming, in some regards, is an offshoot of aromatherapy. According to Ms. Aftel, the proliferation of aromatherapy oils online in the '90s inspired new perfumers to experiment.
 Scent-makers like Yonnette Fleming, 42, of Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, continue to bridge the worlds of aesthetics and healing. Ms. Fleming, an urban farmer and community organizer who grew up among farming people in rural Guyana, planted a 40-by-20-foot herbal plot at the Hattie Carthan Community Garden at the corner of Marcy and Lafayette in Bedford-Stuyvesant. She sells her body products and scents at the Saturday farmers' market she founded there last year.
 Ms. Fleming spends ''probably about 70 hours a week at the garden,'' she said. But she creates her oil infusions and tinctures at home, in a garden-floor brownstone apartment a block away.
 She makes a ''grieving oil,'' she said, by slowly simmering white rose petals in virgin olive oil. To this, she marries vitamin E oil, a stabilizer.
 ''Someone may feel melancholy without a reason,'' Ms. Fleming said, but ''there are all these memories that come up when they use the oil.''
 Her rue-and-sage spritzer -- a blend of alcohol-based tinctures -- is more of a bummer-exorcist. Let's say a brooding ''neighbor comes over,'' Ms. Fleming said, ''and after she leaves, it still feels like she's sitting in your living room.'' That's a situation that definitely calls for the scent of rue.
 AS a teenager in her native Iran, Maggie Mahboubian started making ''kitchen cosmetics.'' Henna mixed with coffee created one hair color; henna with chamomile, another.
 Ms. Mahboubian is in her late 40s now, living with her husband and their 5-year-old daughter in a West Hollywood, Calif., bungalow. And she's still mixing up body products in the kitchen. She also has an architecture degree from Harvard's Graduate School of Design.
 This training gave her an almost-mystical vocabulary to discuss her inventions as a natural perfumer. Her twinned perfumes, Noesis and Noema, for instance, represent ''act of thought'' and ''object of thought'' in phenomenology.
 As descriptions go, this actually seems more evocative than saying the first smells a little like men's soap and the second like flowers.
 Ms. Mahboubian is not immune to a little enchantment in the garden, either. She overhauled the yard after she moved in five years ago. (The only original plant, she said, is a bird of paradise, supposedly a gift from Elvis Presley to the house's first owner, his hairdresser.) And she took up biodynamic gardening.
 According to Ms. Mahboubian, this practice involves following a lunar calendar for sowing seeds and treating the soil with herbal preparations. Periodically, she'll also create her own vortex and bury a cow's horn.
 ''There's a certain aspect of witchcraft to it,'' she said. ''It's fun.''
 In any event, there must be some sort of sorcery involved in Ms. Mahboubian's loveliest fragrance. The label on the tiny vial is plain enough: ''tincture perfume.'' Inside are preparations of native plants she has collected and flowers and herbs from the yard. California sagebrush, rosemary, bay laurel, yarrow.
 First a breath, then the scent: It's Maggie's garden, ever in bloom.
 Creating A Tincture Of Flowers
 SAMPLING some of the essential oils that go into natural perfumes couldn't be easier: just look for an herb or a blossom in the garden.
 ''If you take a leaf and fold it up in your hand and smell your palm, it's a wonderful aroma,'' said Mandy Aftel, an author and leader in the natural perfume movement. Preserving those scents is trickier -- like capturing the sublimity of a sunset with a cellphone photo. Yet it's possible to make fragrant tinctures at home with a minimum of gear.
 The first ingredient is the plant. You may be wondering, should I tincture citrus leaves or citrus blossoms? Mint or rosemary? Rose petals or rose hips? The answer is ''yes.''
 Collect plant materials whenever their scent seems strongest and the leaves aren't wet. ''Clover drying'' them -- airing them out until they're limp -- helps reduce the water content, which is as destructive to a tincture as a maraschino cherry in a dry martini.
 The next ingredient, obliteration-grade alcohol, may take a little creativity. Jeanne Rose, an author and teacher in the field of aromatherapy and natural perfumes, recommends organic neutral grape alcohol. It has a ''fruity scent,'' she said, a remarkable claim for a liquid that's 190 proof. It costs about $125 a gallon. (Some states, including New York, require industrial permits.)
 Less desirable to Ms. Rose, but typically more affordable at less than $15 for a 750-milliliter bottle, is 190-proof Everclear, a grain spirit familiar to college binge-drinkers. (Again, you're on your own with the paperwork.)
 The last two items are a square foot of fiberglass netting (available at most hardware stores) and a clean Mason jar. Can you use an old peanut butter jar? Yes, Ms. Rose says -- if you want your tincture to smell like peanut butter.
 The rest of the process is straightforward. And repetitive. Drop the whole petals or leaves into the jar and pour in just enough alcohol to cover the top. Maybe slosh it around a little. Wait a day, then strain out the petals or leaves through the netting. The alcohol level will drop, but don't add more. Instead, add new, clover-dried petals. And more petals. And do it again. And again. And again.
 Some tinctures take a half-dozen plant changes, some three dozen. And a typical natural perfume may contain 5, 10 or even 20 different scents.
 A side-pour of 190-proof spirits might seem like a way to shorten the wait. But no floral tincture will mask the smell of someone who passed out in gardening clothes.

HEADLINE: BP Concerns Drag Down Other Stocks

BYLINE: By SUSANNA G. KIM; Julia Werdigier contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Investors were shaken Wednesday by the prospect that BP might cut its dividend, pulling down the broader market. 
 In the last hour of trading, the major indexes on Wall Street -- led by energy shares -- turned lower, erasing gains of more than 120 points on the Dow Jones industrial average. 
 BP shares fell 15.80 percent, cutting the company's market capitalization in half since the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig exploded April 20. The costs of cleaning up the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico are growing, and some on Wall Street even fear the company could be forced to seek bankruptcy protection or a merger. 
 But the company has a more immediate problem: mounting pressure from Washington. Lawmakers called on BP to suspend its dividend and advertising to pay for the cleanup, and a senior official said the Justice Department was ''planning to take action.'' The interior secretary, Ken Salazar, said that BP would be asked to compensate energy companies for losses if they had to lay off workers because of the six-month moratorium on deepwater drilling.
 Iain Conn, BP's chief executive for refining and marketing, said at a briefing Wednesday in London that BP was ''totally committed to the cooperation with the administration'' and that they were ''joined together in a desire to mitigate this problem.'' 
 The uncertainty surrounding BP reverberated in the markets. Exxon Mobil dropped 2 percent, and Anadarko Petroleum, which has a 25 percent stake in the disabled well, dropped 18.6 percent. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed down 0.59 percent.
 ''The market reaction is fear of the unknown,'' Tim Guinness, chief investment officer at Guinness Atkinson Funds in London, said. ''I am dismayed by how political this has become, and I don't think the bringing in of politics helps.'' 
 The members of Congress were echoing comments by President Obama last week, when he criticized BP for spending $50 million on TV advertising while people whose livelihoods were wrecked by oil spill were reporting difficulties in getting their claims paid. 
 Thomas J. Perrelli, the associate attorney general, testified before a House committee on Wednesday that ''we are looking very closely at this, and we are planning to take action.'' And the Coast Guard is pressing BP to come up with a better plan for capturing the thousands of barrels of oil spilling into the gulf.
 Of course, with the tremors in Europe over recent months and other uncertainty, investors were already unnerved. 
 ''I just think BP shows how fragile the investor psyche is right now,'' said C. Brett D'Arcy, chief investment officer at CBIZ Wealth Management. ''Here's a situation that should not fundamentally impact the market or the Dow,'' Mr. D'Arcy said, referring to BP's slide to $29.20 a share. ''But it seemed like the market really turned on that information.''
 The Dow fell 40.73 points, or 0.41 percent, to 9,899.25 on Wednesday. The S.& P. 500 lost 6.31 points, to 1,055.69, while the Nasdaq composite index dropped 11.72 points, or 0.54 percent, to 2,158.85.
 The financial and technology sectors also fell.
 In the Treasury market, the 10-year Treasury note rose 3/32, to 102 24/32, and the yield was unchanged.
 Before the new concerns about BP, the markets were substantially higher, mostly because of more reassuring words from the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, who said the sovereign debt crisis in Europe would probably have only a modest impact on the United States if the markets stabilized. He said he expected the economy would grow at a rate of 3.5 percent this year.
 Testifying before the House Budget Committee, Mr. Bernanke said, ''The economy -- supported by stimulative monetary policy and the concerted efforts of policy makers to stabilize the financial system -- appears to be on track to continue to expand through this year and next.''
 His assessment was also reflected in the Fed's latest ''beige book'' report, which said the economy was slowly improving throughout the country.
 ''Bernanke didn't rock the boat,'' said Ryan E. Detrick, senior technical strategist at Schaeffer's Investment Research. ''But it was fairly significant that he said the European issues wouldn't affect us that much, whereas a lot of people said they will.''

HEADLINE: Oil Prices Yawn at the Big Spill

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER SWANN and JEFFREY GOLDFARB

 BODY:
Hamper oil drilling and motorists will pay, industry groupies warn. But the drop in crude prices since BP's Gulf of Mexico blowup suggests deepwater wells have a picayune impact on the market for oil. It's a reminder that America relies on imports anyway and it won't make any real difference to ban difficult drilling until oil companies prove it is safe.
 Crude prices actually fell slightly in the days after President Obama called a six-month time-out on deepwater drilling. Prices even slid soon after the failure of BP's top-kill method to stem the leak, an event that pushed a final resolution out toward August at the earliest and increased the risk of more lasting restrictions on drilling. 
 True, the leak has coincided with a financial crisis in Europe that threatens to undercut energy demand. Even so, if drilling in the United States were as central to oil prices as Congressional cheerleaders for Big Oil imply, events off the Louisiana coast should have sent oil prices higher. Americans should be skeptical the next time a lawmaker claims that curbs on the industry will lead to higher world prices for crude -- and at the pump.
 In fact little the United States does in terms of oil supply has much effect at all on oil prices. Deepwater wells in the Gulf produce around 1.3 million barrels a day, against total global output of roughly 85 million.
 A two-year moratorium on new drilling would reduce potential output by only 300,000 barrels a day in 2015, the International Energy Agency calculates -- a piffling 0.4 percent of current world production. Oil titans in the Middle East could easily pick up the slack. Saudi Arabia alone has four million barrels a day of spare capacity, PFC Energy reckons.
 The fate of deepwater drilling in the United States does, of course, matter much more to the likes of BP and Exxon Mobil, which are shut out of many of the world's biggest oil fields by national oil companies. But the United States government can afford to wait until oil majors show they know how to plug a deepwater well. America's army of auto-crazy drivers won't suffer.
 Viacom's Dividend
 Viacom's youth looks to have been wasted on its investors. The owner of the rock network MTV and kiddie-king Nickelodeon, Viacom was supposed to have been free to run when set loose from stodgy CBS. But instead of growing, Viacom has simply aged. Showing a certain maturity, Viacom declared its first dividend. Sumner Redstone's breakup logic has failed the test of time.
 A conglomerate discount can be a good reason for a carve-up. In the case of Viacom five years ago, the argument seemed at least superficially compelling. Let book publishing and broadcast TV trudge along separately from the more high-stepping cable networks and Paramount film studio. Business theory hasn't turned into reality for Viacom, however. Since the divide, CBS shares, on a total-return basis including dividends, have tumbled 32 percent. Viacom's haven't fared much better, falling 20 percent.
 Over the same span, shares of Disney, which owns a similar mix of businesses to a combined Viacom and CBS, have surged some 37 percent, and that's before factoring in dividend payments. What's more, Disney has managed to find growth-oriented acquisitions, including the superhero maven Marvel and the animation studio Pixar.
 Viacom has generated cash flow but lacked for deals. That's allowing it to finance its first dividend since the CBS separation. The payout, about $364 million annually, is a fraction of its anticipated earnings per share, which will also get a boost, thanks to a restarted $4 billion stock buyback plan. But the 15-cent quarterly dividend is on a par with the average one CBS has paid while on its own, and probably will open the door to a fresh set of yield-seeking investors.
 But that hardly seemed the point of the breakup. Combining CBS and Viacom previously failed to deliver the anticipated synergies and returns, and separating them again hasn't unlocked much value either. That said, Viacom may yet deliver some measure of shareholder return. As a stand-alone cable networks operator, it should be easier for a rival like Time Warner to buy when Mr. Redstone eventually cedes control.

HEADLINE: The Wrong Message on Deficits

 BODY:
The whip-deficits-now fever is running hot on both sides of the Atlantic. In Europe, politicians are understandably spooked by investors dumping government bonds in the wake of the Greek meltdown. But the sudden fierce enthusiasm for fiscal austerity, especially among stronger economies, is likely to backfire, condemning Europe to years of stagnation or worse. 
 The United States is running the same very high risk. Democrats have soured on job creation and economic stimulus in favor of antideficit rhetoric, which Republicans have long seen as the easy road to discontented voters in a confusing election year.
 At a hearing on Wednesday, the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben Bernanke, said job creation and financial-stabilization programs were essential to stop recession from becoming depression, but he also called for ''a strong commitment to fiscal responsibility in the longer run.'' The emphasis in that statement should be on that ''longer run,'' but we fear many politicians weren't listening for nuance. 
 The economic crisis isn't over. Nearly 1 in 10 workers is still unemployed in the United States and in the European Union. Germany, Europe's most robust economy, suffers 7 percent unemployment. In Spain, it is nearly 20 percent. Still, the German government plans to cut its budget deficit from 5 percent to 3 percent of gross domestic product by 2013. The Spanish government promised to cut to 6 percent from 11.2 percent. The new British government promised to take an ax to spending when it proposes its budget on June 22.
 The enthusiasm for budget cutting has spread beyond the United States and Europe. A meeting last week in South Korea of finance ministers from the Group of 20 large economies applauded deficit-reduction talk.
 The Obama administration has warned that the new austerity drive could undercut economic recovery and has pressed the case that stronger countries, such as Germany, should not slam on the brakes. In a letter to G-20 colleagues, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner warned that budget cutting won't work ''unless we are able to strengthen confidence in the global recovery.'' 
 Weak European governments cannot ignore investors dumping their bonds, and they will eventually have to curb their gaping budget deficits. But for everybody to slash public spending when growth is faltering and unemployment remains stubbornly high risks undercutting the goal of fiscal probity by slowing economic growth and reducing tax revenues. 
 The global recovery is already faltering. China's economy is losing momentum. The United States' is slowing. If budget cutting depressed economic growth, the reaction from investors would be no less brutal than their current attack on European bonds.
 The problem calls for a varied response. Some countries, such as Spain or Portugal, may have to drastically cut their budgets if they don't want to lose their access to capital markets. But countries such as Germany, Britain and the United States have space to spend. 
 Interest rates on German and U.S. bonds remain low. Rates on British debt also are very low, reflecting better growth prospects than those of the countries that use the euro. For them, the best policy should be to take advantage of the cheap money to spend more, not less.
 Deficits will have to be reduced once the recovery gains more traction and unemployment recedes. Right now, for the most robust economies -- the United States, Germany, Britain, Japan -- slashing budgets is the wrong thing to do.

HEADLINE: A Revolution On the Ballot

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO -- The time for tinkering is done. 
 That was the message Californians sent when they voted Tuesday to radically rejigger elections in the nation's most populous state. Under Proposition 14, a measure that easily passed, traditional party primaries will be replaced in 2011 with wide-open elections. The top two vote-getters -- whatever their party, or if they have no party at all -- will face off in the general election. 
 Supporters argue that without parties picking candidates for the general election, moderates and independents will move to the fore, and voters will pay more attention to the electoral process. 
 Critics of the measure say it will give a huge advantage to candidates who have the most money or the widest name recognition.
 That no one actually knows what the real effect of Proposition 14 will be seems almost beside the point to frustrated voters. What mattered, supporters said, is that something fundamental about politics -- anything fundamental -- had been changed. 
 As supporters celebrated, they promised to bring the so-called ''top two'' system to a state near you, with Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger leading the charge -- though his second term, plagued by budget meltdowns and plunging popularity, was, analysts said, one of the leading motivators for the measure. 
 Whether the measure will empower more independent voters -- who were already allowed to vote in Democratic or Republican primaries, provided they requested a ballot -- remains to be seen. But what did seem certain was that California was again poised to capture the mood of the country, just as it did in 1978 with Proposition 13, which distilled widespread antitax sentiment into a cap on property taxes. 
 This time, it is the anger of the electorate that Californians have bottled, experts said, even if they are not totally sure what they are doing. 
 ''I don't know that people really knew what they were voting for,'' said Bruce Cain, director of the University of California Washington Center, based in the District of Columbia. 
 Mr. Cain said the state of the state -- high unemployment, record foreclosures and a palpable anger at legislators -- had primed the pump. 
 ''When people get mad,'' he said, ''they lash out.'' 
 But just as with Proposition 13 -- which required a two-thirds majority for the Legislature to increase revenue through new taxes -- Proposition 14 could come with a raft of unintended consequences, opponents say. They cited a potential rise in fringe candidates as well as the marginalization of small parties. 
 ''Big business and big government won yesterday,'' said Christina Tobin, chair of StopTopTwo.org, a leading opponent of the measure, which was heavily outspent by the ''Yes'' side. 
 One probable impact was an increase in litigation; both major parties suggested that they were weighing how to stop the implementation of Proposition 14 before its scheduled start in 2011. 
 Proposition 14 is based on a system in place in one other state, Washington, which the Supreme Court upheld in 2008. Louisiana uses a similar open system, but requires state and local candidates to gain a majority in primaries to win election or face a runoff. 
 On Wednesday, Mr. Schwarzenegger was being hailed by backers as a political winner and an agent of change, as he trumpeted Proposition 14's promise of encouraging moderates -- who, the argument goes, are shunned by highly partisan primary voters. He also acknowledged the rising role of independents, who now make up one in five voters in the state. 
 ''We in California have said we've got to come to the center, we've got to bring everyone together in order to solve problems,'' Mr. Schwarzenegger said at a news conference in Los Angeles. ''And I think the rest of the nation eventually will find out this is exactly where the action is.''
 What is also certain is that voters liked Proposition 14; it won in 56 of the state's 58 counties, with the only two detractors coming from opposite ends of the political spectrum: Orange, the conservative bastion in the south, and San Francisco, the liberal paradise in the north. 
 Despite that mandate, Ron Nehring, the chairman of the Californian Republican Party, which opposed the proposition alongside the state's Democrats and four smaller parties, said the measure would actually take power away from the mass of primary voters and hand it instead to a smaller group of party leaders and loyalists who would decide their candidates in conventions and caucuses. A single handpicked candidate would then get support, he said, while challengers would be shunned. 
 ''Ninety-nine percent of the Republicans that were involved in choosing our candidates are now excluded from choosing our candidates,'' Mr. Nehring said. ''In the future this decision will be made by no more than a few thousand and, in most cases, a few dozen.''
 California voters may not be finished with their shake-up. The November ballot, after all, will include a measure to tax and regulate marijuana, as well as possibly including proposals to eliminate the two-thirds majority for passing a budget and further limit legislators' time in office. (California was one of the first states to adopt term limits in 1990.) 
 All of those elections will likely pivot on the ability to draw independents, who were ecstatic about Proposition 14's passage.
 ''There is now a new political force in California,'' said Royce D'Orazio, a stand-up comic who works as the Los Angeles chapter organizer for the group independentvoice.org, who spoke at the governor's side on Wednesday. ''To all our brothers and sisters in states across this country, help is on the way.''
 For his part, Mr. Schwarzenegger seemed pleased by his victory -- ''this is, by the way, national news,'' he said -- but still tried to temper expectations for an electorate hungry for anything new.
 ''It will not solve all the problems,'' the governor said. ''But it will change a lot.''

HEADLINE: In Arkansas, Battle Over, It Is Time For Another

BYLINE: By SHAILA DEWAN; Steven Greenhouse contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- Senator Blanche Lincoln can hear you, Arkansas. 
 Or so she said again and again as she fought her way through a political near-death experience, as if the state's voters were a bedside presence pulling her back from the white light of oblivion. 
 And so she said once more, for good measure, in her victory speech after besting her challenger, Lt. Gov. Bill Halter, for the Democratic nomination in a runoff on Tuesday by four points. 
 ''I have heard your message,'' Mrs. Lincoln said. ''Your message is loud and clear: that Washington -- Washington needs to work for us.''
 Mrs. Lincoln's newfound listening skills will surely come in handy as she enters the general election against a Republican congressman, John Boozman, a race sure to attract considerable interest and money from the national parties. 
 Mrs. Lincoln's critics on both sides of the ideological spectrum have long predicted that there is no way she can survive such a challenge, and Republicans are salivating to attack her for, among other things, her support of the Democrats' sweeping health care bill.
 Still, Mrs. Lincoln is an incumbent Democrat in a largely Democratic state. Her campaign has $2 million (Mr. Boozman raised less than $900,000 in his primary fight; he has not filed a finance report since.) Mrs. Lincoln has been a statewide name for a dozen years, while Mr. Boozman is not well known outside his district in conservative northwest Arkansas. 
 In 1998, when Mrs. Lincoln first won a Senate seat, her opponent was Mr. Boozman's brother, Fay Boozman.
 Jay Barth, a political scientist at Hendrix College, said the challenge from Mr. Halter had improved Mrs. Lincoln's game, forcing her to overcome a reputation for aloofness and to speak directly to the camera in her commercials.
 ''She does have a political albatross around her neck with the president,'' Mr. Barth said. ''The antipathy towards President Obama is pretty deep here, and it's not new.'' 
 Republicans in Arkansas often fare better with social than economic issues, but in his opening volley Mr. Boozman confronted economics head on.
 ''We are going to run an aggressive campaign making the distinctions clear on Obamacare, card check, cap-and-trade, job-killing stimulus legislation and the tax-and-spend initiatives that continue to plunge our nation further into enormous debt,'' he said in a statement. 
 In an appeal for donations on Wednesday, Mr. Boozman's campaign manager, Sarah Huckabee Sanders (the daughter of Mike Huckabee), called her boss ''a man of class and conscience,'' in contrast to Mrs. Lincoln, for whom she reserved epithets like ''slanderous,'' ''negative'' and whom she compared to Harry Reid, the embattled Senate majority leader.
 Mrs. Lincoln's campaign manager, Steve Patterson, offered a hint to his strategy, as well. In an interview, he said that Mr. Boozman had voted with the Republican Party the vast majority of the time, and that Mrs. Lincoln had proven that ''she's an independent voice for Arkansas.''
 Mrs. Lincoln is also the chairwoman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, a bullet point which largely disappeared from her runoff campaign (perhaps because it reminded people too much of Washington) but may now return to her repertoire. 
 Labor union leaders defended themselves against accusations that they had squandered millions of dollars in support of Mr. Halter. ''We didn't waste any money,'' said Alan Hughes, the president of the Arkansas A.F.L.-C.I.O. ''Here's an 11-year incumbent who won by only 10,000 votes in a runoff, and we had to battle President Obama and President Clinton.''
 By August, when the state's unions meet in Hot Springs to decide on their endorsements, they may be ready to reconsider their declaration of war against Mrs. Lincoln.
 ''Some union members complain, 'She's no better than a Republican on key issues,' '' Mr. Hughes said, ''while other union members say, 'We can't afford to give this seat up to a Republican.' ''

HEADLINE: A Nimble Bernanke Both Warns and Reassures

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- When it comes to the deficit, Ben S. Bernanke has a story, and he's sticking to it.
 Mr. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, warned on Wednesday that ''the federal budget appears to be on an unsustainable path,'' but also recognized that an ''exceptional increase'' in the deficit had been necessary to ease the pain of recession.
 In nearly two hours of questioning by the House Budget Committee, however, Mr. Bernanke gave potential succor to members of both parties, while refusing to side with either of them. 
 To Republicans, he offered warnings about the fiscal perils of an aging population and the potential threat of soaring long-term interest rates. To Democrats, he made it clear that persistently high unemployment was a drag on growth and said that additional short-term stimulus spending might be needed.
 All the while, Mr. Bernanke refused to endorse any particular spending cuts or tax increases, or even specify the balance between the two. And he was not subtle about his strategy. 
 ''I'm trying to avoid taking sides on this because it's really up to Congress to make those decisions,'' he told Representative Michael K. Simpson, Republican of Idaho. 
 ''But we need your expertise on it,'' Mr. Simpson pressed.
 ''Well, no,'' Mr. Bernanke replied. ''Plenty of people have that kind of expertise, including the Congressional Budget Office and others.'' 
 With inflation well below the Fed's unofficial target of about 2 percent, attention has turned to the other side of the central bank's mandate: maximizing employment. At the same time, the debt crisis roiling Europe has made deficit-cutting a potent topic.
 Mr. Bernanke suggested that the United States had a while longer -- but not much -- before it would have to pull in the reins.
 ''This very moment is not the time to radically reduce our spending or raise our taxes, because the economy is still in a recovery mode and needs that support,'' Mr. Bernanke told Representative Bob Etheridge, Democrat of North Carolina.
 In the next breath, however, he added that continuing deficits risked a ''potential loss of confidence in the markets.''
 Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, the top Republican on the committee, focused his opening statement on Europe. ''What we are watching in real time is the rough justice of the marketplace and the severe economic turmoil that can be inflicted on profligate countries mired in debt,'' he said.
 But if Mr. Ryan had hoped for similarly dire pronouncements from Mr. Bernanke, he was disappointed. 
 ''If markets continue to stabilize, then the effects of the crisis on economic growth in the United States seem likely to be modest,'' Mr. Bernanke testified. ''Although the recent fall in equity prices and weaker economic prospects in Europe will leave some imprint on the U.S. economy, offsetting factors include declines in interest rates on Treasury bonds and home mortgages, as well as lower prices for oil and some other globally traded commodities.''
 Representative Jeb Hensarling, Republican of Texas, cited the research of the economist Carmen M. Reinhart, who has found that growth tends to stall in countries where the national debt reaches 90 percent of gross domestic product. The United States is at just about that threshold.
 ''I don't think there's anything magic about 90 percent,'' Mr. Bernanke said, while noting that in the worst-case projections by the Congressional Budget Office, ''debt and interest payments are going to get explosive in 10 or 15 years.'' 
 When Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio, asked Mr. Bernanke to ''talk to me about those tax increases that we know are going to happen,'' Mr. Bernanke replied: ''We have a recovery under way now. So in the very near term, increased taxes, cuts in spending, that are too large would be a negative, would be a drag on the recovery.'' 
 But he reiterated that ''I'm not going to try to adjudicate for Congress'' between tax and spending measures. 
 Mr. Bernanke's nimbleness in navigating deficit politics reflects his position as the most visible bridge between two administrations, having been appointed by President George W. Bush in 2006 and then reappointed by Mr. Obama to a second four-year term. 
 Mr. Bernanke has seemed more optimistic, or at least confident, since the crisis peaked in 2008. ''As long as we have the confidence of the markets that we will be able to exit from this situation with a sustainable fiscal program, then I think we'll be O.K.,'' he told Mr. Simpson of Idaho.
 How long that confidence will last, Mr. Bernanke did not say.
 Only after several rounds of back-and-forth did he agree with Representative Chet Edwards, Democrat of Texas, that tax cuts do not entirely pay for themselves. And he danced around with Representative Gerald E. Connolly, a Virginia Democrat, on whether the Obama administration's $787 billion stimulus package last year was ''necessary.'' Mr. Bernanke would only say it was ''useful.'' 
 ''It must be nice to be an economist,'' Mr. Connolly replied.

HEADLINE: Hidden Misery: A Glimpse Into North Korea

BYLINE: By SHARON LaFRANIERE; Su-Hyun Lee contributed research from Seoul, South Korea.

 BODY:
YANJI, China -- Like many North Koreans, the construction worker lived in penury. His state employer had not paid him for so long that he had forgotten his salary. Indeed, he paid his boss to be listed as a dummy worker so that he could leave his work site. Then he and his wife could scrape out a living selling small bags of detergent on the black market. 
 It hardly seemed that life could get worse. And then, one Saturday afternoon last November, his sister burst into his apartment in Chongjin with shocking news: the North Korean government had decided to drastically devalue the nation's currency. The family's life savings, about $1,560, had been reduced to about $30.
 Last month the construction worker sat in a safe house in this bustling northern Chinese city, lamenting years of useless sacrifice. Vegetables for his parents, his wife's asthma medicine, the navy track suit his 15-year-old daughter craved -- all were forsworn on the theory that, even in North Korea, the future was worth saving for. 
 ''Ai!'' he exclaimed, cursing between sobs. ''How we worked to save that money! Thinking about it makes me go crazy.'' 
 North Koreans are used to struggle and heartbreak. But the Nov. 30 currency devaluation, apparently an attempt to prop up a foundering state-run economy, was for some the worst disaster since a famine that killed hundreds of thousands in the mid-1990s. 
 Interviews in the past month with eight North Koreans who recently left their country -- a prison escapee, illegal traders, people in temporary exile to find work in China, the traveling wife of an official in the ruling Workers' Party -- paint a haunting portrait of desperation inside North Korea, a nation of 24 million people, and of growing resentment toward its erratic leader, Kim Jong-il. 
 What seems missing -- for now, at least -- is social instability. Widespread hardship, popular anger over the currency revaluation and growing political uncertainty as Mr. Kim seeks to install his third son as his successor have not hardened into noticeable resistance against the government. At least two of those interviewed in China hewed to the official propaganda line that North Korea was a victim of die-hard enemies, its impoverishment a Western plot, its survival threatened by the United States, South Korea and Japan. 
 South Korea's charge that North Korea sank one of its warships, the Cheonan, in March was just part of the plot, the party official's wife said. 
 ''That's why we have weapons to protect ourselves,'' she said while visiting relatives in northern China -- and earning spare cash as a waitress. ''Our enemies are trying to hit us from all sides, and that's why we lack electricity and good infrastructure. North Korea must keep its doors locked.'' 
 Others were more skeptical of the government's propaganda, but still cast war as an inevitability. ''We always wait for the invasion,'' said one former primary school teacher. ''My son says he wishes the war would come because life is too hard, and we will probably die anyway from starvation.'' 
 They and other North Koreans spoke only on the condition that they could withhold their names in discussions largely arranged by underground churches operating in China just across the border. If they were identified as traveling or working in China illegally, they could be deported and imprisoned, along with their relatives.
 About half of those interviewed said they planned to return to North Korea; the other half hoped to defect to South Korea. 
 On many details, their accounts, given separately, dovetailed. They also reinforced descriptions by economists and political analysts of a stricken nation. 
 A Reeling Economy
 Citing aerial photos of plumeless smokestacks, economists say roughly three of every four North Korean factories are idle. The economy has been staggering badly since 2006, when Kim Jong-il pulled out of multinational talks aimed at ending his nuclear weapons program. The sinking of the Cheonan will further damage the economy: South Korea has suspended nearly all trade, depriving the North of $333 million a year from seafood sales and other exports. 
 When the Korean Peninsula was divided in 1945, South Korea was poorer than its neighbor. Now its average worker earns 15 times as much as an average North Korean, according to cost-of-living-adjusted data. The number of defectors who make it through China to South Korea has steadily risen for a decade, hitting nearly 3,000 last year. 
 Infant and maternal mortality rates jumped at least 30 percent from 1993 to 2008, and life expectancy fell by three years to 69 during the same period, according to North Korean census figures and the United Nations Population Fund.
 The United Nations World Food Program says one in three North Korean children under the age of 5 are malnourished. More than one in four people need food aid, the agency says, but only about one in 17 will get it this year, partly because donors are reluctant to send aid to a country that has insisted on developing nuclear weapons.
 The currency devaluation has only heightened the suffering. Its aim was to divert the proceeds of North Korea's vast entrepreneurial underground -- its street markets -- to its cash-starved government businesses. 
 The markets are the sole source of income for many North Koreans, but they flout the government's credo of economic socialism. Theoretically, everyone except minors, the elderly and mothers with young children works for the state. But state enterprises have been withering for 30 years, and North Koreans do all they can to escape work in them. 
 Farmers tend their own gardens as weeds overtake collective farms. Urban workers duck state assignments to peddle everything from metal scavenged from mothballed factories to televisions smuggled from China. 
 ''If you don't trade, you die,'' said the former teacher, a round-faced 51-year-old woman with a ponytail. She went from obedient state employee to lawbreaking trader, but could not escape her plight. 
 Too Hungry to Study
 She taught primary school for 30 years in Chongjin, North Korea's third-largest city, with roughly 500,000 people. What once was an all-day job shrank by 2004 to morning duty; schools closed at noon. At least 15 of her 50 students dropped out or left after an hour, too hungry to study. 
 ''It is very hard to teach a starving child,'' she said. ''Even sitting at a desk is difficult for them.'' 
 Teachers were hungry, too. Her monthly salary scarcely bought two pounds of rice, she said. A university graduate, she pulled her own child out of the third grade in 1998, instead sending her to a neighbor to learn to sew. 
 She quit in 2004 to sell corn noodles outside Chongjin's main market, an expanse of stalls and plastic tarpaulins half the size of a city block where traders mainly sell Chinese goods, including toothpaste, sewing needles and DVDs of banned South Korean soap operas. 
 But noodles were barely profitable, so she tried a riskier trade in state-controlled commodities: pine nuts and red berries used in a popular tea. That scheme collapsed in October. After she and her partners collected 17 sacks of goods from a village, a guard at a checkpoint confiscated them all instead of taking a bribe to let them pass. She was left with $300 in debt. 
 Like her, the construction worker, a rail-thin 45-year-old with a head for numbers, figured that private enterprise was his family's only salvation. But as a man, it was harder for him to shake off his work assignment.
 On paper, he said, a Chongjin state construction company employs him. But the company has few supplies and no cash to pay its employees. So like more than a third of the workers, the worker said, he pays roughly $5 a month to sign in as an employee on the company's daily log -- and then toil elsewhere. 
 Such payments, widespread at smaller state companies, are supposed to keep companies solvent, said one 62-year-old woman who is a trader in Chongjin. Even a major enterprise like the city's metal refinery has not paid salaries since 2007, she and others said, though workers there collect 10 days worth of food rations each month. 
 ''How would the companies survive if they didn't get money from the workers?'' she asked without irony. 
 Recently, the construction worker's firm has been more active. The state has resurfaced Chongjin's only paved road and built a hospital and a university for the 2012 centennial of the birth of Kim Il-sung, Kim Jong-il's father and North Korea's founder. 
 But the burst of projects bore a cost: each family was required to deliver 17 bags of pebbles every month to its local party committee. The construction worker enlisted his elderly parents to scour creek beds and fields for rocks that the family smashed by hand into grape-size stones. 
 With no state salary, he earns money by his wits. Every October, he sells squid caught from a boat he pilots in treacherous coastal waters. In other months, he bicycles about 20 miles every day looking for goods to sell, typically detergent bought from a factory that is resold by his wife at a 12 percent markup on a purple tarpaulin outside the main market. 
 The government periodically tries to rein in the markets, regulating prices, hours, types of goods sold, the sellers' age and sex and even whether they haul their wares on bicycles or their backs.
 Savings Wiped Out
 In one 2007 Central Committee communique, Kim Jong-il complained that the markets had become ''a birthplace of all sorts of nonsocialist practices.'' The Nov. 30 currency devaluation upended them. The state decreed that a new, more valuable won would replace the old won, but that families could trade only 100,000 won, about $30 at the black market rate, for the new one. The move effectively wiped out private stores of money.
 To cushion the blow, workers say, they were promised that their salaries would be restored if they returned to their government jobs. In fact, the construction worker and others say, they got one month's pay, in January, before salaries again disappeared. 
 Some with political connections skirted the worst. One woman from Hamhung, North Korea's second-largest city, said the local bank director allowed her relatives to exchange three million won, 30 times the official limit. 
 The party official's wife, hair softly curled, a knock-off designer purse by her side, boasted about her six-room house with two color televisions and a garden. In the next breath, she praised devaluation as well-deserved punishment of those who had cheated the state, even though she acknowledged that it led to chaos and noted that a top finance official was executed for mismanaging the policy. 
 ''A lot of bad people had gotten rich doing illegal trading with China, while the good people at the state companies didn't have enough money,'' she said. ''So the haves gave to the have-nots.'' 
 The former teacher gave all she had. After her creditors stripped her of all her money, she said, she walked across the frozen Tumen River at night and into China to seek help from her relatives there. Famished and terrified, she said she banged randomly on doors until a stranger helped her contact them. 
 Now safe in her relatives' home, she said, she marvels over how they enjoy delicacies like cucumbers in winter. But temporarily deserting her son and daughter, both in their mid-20s, has left her so guilt-ridden that she sometimes cannot swallow the food set in front of her. ''I don't know whether my children have managed to get some money, or whether they have starved to death,'' she said, her eyes brimming with tears. 
 For the construction worker, his sister's news of the coming devaluation unleashed a furious scramble to salvage the family nest egg. He emptied the living-room cabinet drawer that held their savings and split it with his wife and daughter, telling them, ''Buy whatever you can, as fast as you can.'' 
 The three bicycled furiously to Chongjin's market. ''It was like a battlefield,'' he said. 
 Thousands of people frantically tried to outbid one another to convert soon-to-be worthless money into something tangible. Some prices rose 10,000 percent, he said, before traders shut down, realizing that their profits soon would be worthless, too. 
 The three said they returned home with 66 pounds of rice, a pig's head and 220 pounds of bean curd. The construction worker's daughter had managed to purchase a small cutting board and a used pair of khaki pants. Together, he said, they spent the equivalent of $860 for items that would have cost less than $20 the day before. 
 His daughter tried to comfort him. ''Father, I will keep this pair of pants until I die!'' she pledged. He told her the cutting board would be her wedding gift. 
 ''At that moment, I really wanted to kill myself,'' he said. He gestured toward the safe-house window and beyond toward nighttime Yanji, brightly lighted and humming with traffic. ''It is not like here,'' he said. ''Here, it is not a big deal to make money. There, it is suffering and suffering; sacrificing and sacrificing.'' 
 He said he lay awake night after night afterward, fixated on the navy track suit his daughter had coveted. She had said it put her thick winter sweater and plain trousers to shame. He had put her off because the cheapest ones were nearly $15. When she brought it up once too often, he had cursed and shouted, ''People in this house need to eat first!'' 
 ''I cannot describe how terrible I feel that I didn't buy that for her,'' he said, his voice trembling. 
 A Profound Isolation
 Those North Koreans who have never crossed the border have no way to make sense of their tribulations. There is no Internet. Television and radio receivers are soldered to government channels. Even the party official's wife lacks a telephone and mourns her lack of contact with the outside world. Her first question to a foreigner was ''Am I pretty?'' 
 Slowly, however, information is seeping in. Traders return from China to report that people are richer and comparatively freer, and that South Koreans are supposedly even more so. Some of the traders have cellphones that are linked to the Chinese cellular network and can be surreptitiously borrowed for exorbitant fees.
 Punishment for watching foreign films and television shows is stiff. The trader said a 35-year-old neighbor spent six months in a labor camp last year after he was caught watching ''Twin Dragons,'' a farcical Hong Kong action film starring Jackie Chan. Yet to the dismay of the former teacher, her 26-year-old son takes similar risks.
 Her sister is married to a government official in the capital, Pyongyang, she said, but neither is a fan of Kim Jong-il. On her most recent visit, she said, her sister whispered to her, '' 'People follow him because of fear, not because of love.' ''
 Since the currency devaluation, she and others say, people are noticeably bolder with such comments. 
 ''Now, if you go to the market, people will say anything,'' the construction worker said. ''They will say the government is a thief -- even in broad daylight.'' 
 His wife was not among them. For weeks after the devaluation, he said, she lay on a living-room floor mat, immobilized by depression. ''I had no strength to say anything to her,'' he said. 
 Finally, he told her to get up. It was time to start over.

HEADLINE: A Call to Triple U.S. Spending on Energy Research

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The United States is badly lagging in basic research on new forms of energy, deepening the nation's dependence on dirty fuels and crippling its international competitiveness, a diverse group of business executives warn in a study to be released Thursday.
 The group, which includes Bill Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft; Jeffrey R. Immelt, chief executive of General Electric; and John Doerr, a top venture capitalist, urges the government to more than triple spending on energy research and development, to $16 billion a year. And it recommends creation of a national energy board to guide investment decisions toward radical advances in energy technology. 
 Mr. Gates said in an interview that drastic changes were needed in the way the United States produced and consumed energy to assure its security and to begin to address climate change. He endorsed the administration's goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent by 2050, but said that was not possible with today's technology or politics.
 ''Among all the swirl of different ideas of how to raise the money and how to regulate carbon,'' he said, ''there is no way either in this country or internationally you're going to come close to meeting an 80 percent reduction unless you have an immense breakthrough.''
 He said that the only way to find such disruptive new technology was to pour large sums of money at the problem, with the clear understanding that any number of ventures would fail before the eureka moment arrived.
 Mr. Gates and his fellow executives are stepping forward at what may prove a pivotal moment in American energy policy. Oil continues to spew from a crippled well in the Gulf of Mexico, the Obama administration is pushing for a new approach to energy and climate policy and the Senate is about to embark on a debate on a set of conflicting proposals that pit not only Republicans against Democrats but different regions of the country against each other. 
 There is no assurance that this latest effort will produce new ideas or bear fruit.
 The executive group, which calls itself the American Energy Innovation Council, will propose a series of measures that it hopes will transcend the politics of the moment and put the nation on a path to a different energy future.
 The group notes that the federal government spends less than $5 billion a year on energy research and development, not counting one-time stimulus projects. About $30 billion is spent annually on health research and more than $80 billion on military R.& D. They advocate a jump in spending on basic energy research because the private sector cannot provide that level of capital for unproven technologies, but do not say where the new money can be found.
 ''When our company shifted our attention to clean energy, we found the innovation cupboard was close to bare,'' said John Doerr, of the Silicon Valley venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. ''My partners and I found the best fuel cells, the best energy storage and the best wind technology were all born outside of the United States.''
 Mr. Gates said the group had not yet identified any potential breakthrough technologies, but was looking at advances in known energy sources -- nuclear power, solar and wind -- as well as in technology to store electricity and capture carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel plants. 
 The group says that the nation must put a price on carbon emissions, but does not endorse a single method like a tax or a cap-and-trade scheme. ''There are many paths,'' Mr. Gates said, ''but there are problems on every single path. What you need is a strategy that identifies those blocks -- whether it is science, economics or regulation -- and breaks through them.''
 The business group, which also includes Norman R. Augustine, the former chairman of Lockheed Martin; Ursula M. Burns, chief executive of Xerox; Charles O. Holliday, former chief executive of DuPont; and Theodore M. Solso, chairman of Cummins, plan to announce the project on Thursday morning, then meet with Congressional leaders and with President Obama.
 Jason S. Grumet, the president of the Bipartisan Policy Center and an adviser to the group, said that what set this effort apart was not only the members of the panel but the moment in American history.
 ''In the shadow of the tragedy in the gulf,'' Mr. Grumet said, ''to have people who are iconic figures in the fabric of the American economy saying it's time to choose our energy future creates the possibility of a Sputnik moment in the American political dialogue.''

HEADLINE: Day 50: The Latest on the Oil Spill

 BODY:
Center Sees Spike in Number of Oiled Birds
 The United States Fish and Wildlife Service reported Wednesday that the wildlife rescue center in Fort Jackson, La., had received more than five times as many oiled birds in the past few days than in the previous six weeks combined. The agency said that more than 400 birds had arrived at the center since the spill began -- and that more than 350 of those had been reported since last Thursday. 
 Salazar Addresses Drilling Moratorium at Hearing
 Interior Secretary Ken Salazar told a Senate hearing on Wednesday that he would ask BP to repay the salaries of any workers laid off as a result of the six-month moratorium on deepwater exploratory drilling imposed by the United States government after the spill. Mr. Salazar said he would consider lifting the moratorium early if he received recommendations from a presidential commission investigating the spill sooner than expected. Senator Mary L. Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana, said the moratorium could wreak economic havoc in the gulf region that ''exceeds the havoc from the spill itself.'' 
 Coast Guard Official Demands Transparency From BP
 In a letter to BP, Adm. Thad W. Allen of the Coast Guard, who is leading the federal response, told company representatives that the government wanted to meet with them to ensure that they were meeting their commitment to restore the region after the devastation of the spill. ''We're getting anecdotal reports, especially during the president's visits down to Grand Isle last week, that there might be some inconsistencies in the claims process,'' he said. The government wants the company to turn over more records on claims. ''They own the data,'' Admiral Allen said. ''We need the data,'' he added, so the government can ''move forward to correct any problems we might find.'' 
 EPA Lists Chemicals in Dispersants
 The Environmental Protection Agency made public a list of the chemical ingredients of two controversial products being used to disperse the oil. But it did not give a precise recipe, and the information did little to alter competing views on whether this kind of petroleum-based product has done more harm than good by threatening ecosystems.

HEADLINE: Obama Pledges New Aid For Gaza and West Bank

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER and ISABEL KERSHNER; Helene Cooper reported from Washington, and Isabel Kershner from Jerusalem.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama urged the Israeli government to loosen its blockade of Gaza on Wednesday, as the United States continued to scramble to find a way out of the stalemate in the Middle East and address the outcry over Israel's deadly raid on a Gaza-bound flotilla last week.
 Mr. Obama, meeting with the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, at the White House, also promised a $400 million aid package for the West Bank and Gaza, though only about $70 million represented a new commitment. White House officials said the money would be spent on housing, schools, efforts to provide access to drinking water and other health and infrastructure projects. 
 The details of how the aid would be used in Gaza remained unclear. Nor was it immediately clear how Mr. Abbas, who has authority in the West Bank but not in Gaza, would be able to administer it.
 Gaza has faced an Israeli and Egyptian blockade since 2007. An Israeli raid that thwarted a Turkish-led flotilla carrying aid and activists toward Gaza last week intensified international protests over the blockade, which Mr. Obama has called ''unsustainable.'' Israel contends that the blockade is necessary to prevent the smuggling of arms to Hamas, the militant Islamist organization that governs Gaza and opposes Israel's existence.
 Administration officials and their European allies have been pressing the Israeli government to partly lift the blockade to allow a freer flow of nonmilitary goods.
 ''We, and I think President Abbas agrees with this, recognize that Israel should not have missiles flying out of Gaza into its territories,'' Mr. Obama said Wednesday. ''And so there should be a means by which we are able to stop the flow of arms that could endanger Israel's security.'' 
 ''At the same time,'' the president added, ''we're doing so in a way that allows the people in Gaza to live out their aspirations and their dreams both for themselves and their children. And that's something that we're going to spend a lot of time focusing on, and we've already begun some hardheaded discussions with the Israelis in achieving that.''
 Mr. Obama said that ''there should be some ways of focusing narrowly on arms shipments rather than focusing in a blanket way on stopping everything and then, in a piecemeal way, allowing things into Gaza.''
 In the past few days, Israel has added juice and preserves to the basic supplies it allows into Gaza but has denied that this signaled any change in policy as a result of international pressure. An Israeli security official, speaking on the condition of anonymity under army rules, said the broadening of the list of supplies was ''the continuation of a process'' that had been going on for months.
 International organizations working in Gaza have warned of growing hardship. Deprived of raw materials, local industry has been severely damaged, and the Gaza economy has collapsed. 
 ''It is not enough to permit Gaza residents to purchase Israeli-made cookies,'' Gisha, an advocacy group that focuses on freedom of movement for Palestinians, said in a statement on Wednesday. ''Israel should stop banning raw materials such as industrial margarine and glucose, so that Gaza residents can produce their own cookies and restart the economy that has been paralyzed for three years.''
 Mr. Obama is trying to steer Palestinians back to the negotiating table with Israelis, while at the same time trying to persuade Israelis that the United States and his administration have Israel's best interests at heart. 
 Many Israelis blame Mr. Obama for Mr. Abbas's refusal so far to engage in direct negotiations. When Mr. Obama demanded last year that Israel freeze construction of settlements in the West Bank, a demand that Israel refused, many Palestinian officials said afterward that they could not go ahead with direct negotiations. But in the past, Palestinians had often entered direct negotiations with Israel absent such a freeze.
 Mr. Abbas is still seeking some sort of gesture, either from the Americans or from the Israelis, administration officials said, before he will enter direct negotiations. 
 ''The Palestinian position is that we've been engaged with Mitchell,'' said Ghaith al-Omari, a former negotiator with the Palestinian Authority, referring to Mr. Obama's Middle East envoy, George J. Mitchell. ''We've given position papers to Mitchell. We don't have a problem with moving to direct talks, but before that the Israelis have to present their positions to the administration.''
 Israeli officials counter that they do not want to offer their positions before direct talks begin, because that would be akin to negotiating against themselves. 
 After Mr. Obama's meeting with Mr. Abbas, the White House put out a statement that ''the president has described the situation in Gaza as unsustainable, and it demands a significant change in strategy.'' 
 The statement said that ''while we work with our partners in the Palestinian Authority, Israel, Egypt and the international community to put such a strategy in place, these projects represent a down payment on the United States' commitment to Palestinians in Gaza, who deserve a better life and expanded opportunities, and the chance to take part in building a viable, independent state of Palestine, together with those who live in the West Bank.''

HEADLINE: Democrats Seek Votes on Spending Bill

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Senate Democrats searched Wednesday for support to pass a $140 billion package of tax breaks, safety-net spending and tax increases on the affluent as lawmakers worried that a final chance to take broad aim at unemployment before the November elections could slip away.
 Increasingly caught between demands to end deficit spending and the push to invest federal dollars to create jobs, Democrats were trying, so far unsuccessfully, to find a balance that could attract at least 60 votes to advance the bill. 
 Not all Democrats were considered likely to back the measure. And a handful of Republicans who would be the most obvious prospects for supporting it were resisting, saying they were alarmed by the measure's mounting price tag and its $78 billion impact on the deficit. Both exceeded the amount approved by the House in a similar bill late last month.
 ''They are heading in the wrong direction,'' said Senator Susan Collins, a moderate Republican from Maine, who said she could not back the present measure.
 Efforts to win approval of the legislation were not helped by results from Tuesday's election reflecting a continuing frustration with Congress and the strength of appeals to pare government spending.
 ''The anger and dissatisfaction continues to be displayed in poll after poll and election after election,'' Senator John McCain, an Arizona Republican who has his own contested primary election coming up, said Wednesday.
 Republicans planned to offer their own scaled-down plan that would be paid for through a combination of unspent economic stimulus money and spending cuts. Senator Tom Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma, released a plan late Wednesday for $126 billion in savings, including a $100 million cut in Congressional budgets, a freeze on federal salaries and a $10 billion reduction in government travel.
 Democrats lamented resistance to the measure, which includes an extension of unemployment benefits for those who have exhausted their initial compensation. They said that unemployment money would be quickly injected back into the economy and that tax breaks and other provisions would spur hiring.
 ''This legislation before us will create jobs, it will increase demand for goods and services, and it will provide stability for Americans who have lost their jobs during this recession,'' said Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire, who acknowledged the budget concerns.
 ''I, too, believe we must get back on a path to a balanced budget, but the best way to do that is to get this economy moving again,'' Ms. Shaheen said.
 Democrats said they still expected to ultimately pass the measure -- though it was not likely to face a test vote before next week -- because it included provisions both parties favor, like the $40 billion extension of unemployment pay along with billions of dollars in business and personal tax breaks. 
 ''At the end of the day,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, the No. 3 Democrat, ''we will get the votes.''
 Democrats were also looking for lobbying help from governors who supported the inclusion of $24 billion sought by states for help with health care costs -- one element of the Senate bill that drove the cost higher than the price tag in the House.
 And they were calculating that Republicans would not want to be blamed if a scheduled cut in Medicare payments to doctors resulted in some older Americans being dropped by their physicians.
 The 21 percent cut, which technically went into effect at the beginning of June, would be blocked by the legislation, which would provide $23 billion for a 2.2 percent increase in fees through the end of this year and an additional 1 percent next year.
 Some Republicans said that the Medicare money was needed but that it should be offset by changes elsewhere in the budget, not added to the deficit as emergency spending.
 ''It ought not to be paid for by borrowing the money on top of all the debt we are now running up in this country,'' said Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama.
 Republicans also complained Wednesday that Democratic authors of the bill were engaging in accounting gimmicks by imposing a $15 billion increase in fees paid into a liability fund by oil producers to mask the true cost of the measure. 
 With the spill continuing in the Gulf of Mexico, lawmakers have felt free to increase the tax on oil companies; the Senate measure would charge 41 cents per barrel instead of the 8 cents now collected. The increase would lower the measure's impact on the deficit even though the oil money could be spent only on disaster cleanup, not on other elements of the bill.
 Some Congressional Democrats and party activists complain the party has grown timid about government spending at an inopportune time, arguing that federal spending is needed to sustain the economic recovery. These lawmakers sought expert backing for that view on Wednesday, pressing the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, during a House Budget Committee hearing on whether it would be wise to cut back on state aid at the moment.
 Mr. Bernanke said he did not want to judge specific elements of any fiscal plan. But, he said, in terms of the time frame, ''This very moment is not the time to radically reduce our spending or raise our taxes because the economy is still in a recovery mode and needs that support.''

HEADLINE: U.N. APPROVES NEW SANCTIONS TO DETER IRAN

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR; Mark Landler contributed reporting from Bogota, Colombia, and David E. Sanger from Washington.

 BODY:
UNITED NATIONS -- The United Nations Security Council leveled its fourth round of sanctions against Iran's nuclear program on Wednesday, but the measures did little to overcome widespread doubts that they -- or even the additional steps pledged by American and European officials -- would accomplish the Council's longstanding goal: halting Iran's production of nuclear fuel. 
 The new resolution, hailed by President Obama as delivering ''the toughest sanctions ever faced by the Iranian government,'' took months to negotiate and major concessions by American officials, but still failed to carry the symbolic weight of a unanimous decision. Twelve of the 15 nations on the Council voted for the measure, while Turkey and Brazil voted against it and Lebanon abstained. 
 The United States and Europe acknowledged before negotiations started that they would not get the tough sanctions they were hoping for, promising to enact harsher measures on their own once they had the imprimatur of the United Nations. Congress is expected to pass a package of unilateral sanctions against Iran, and European leaders will begin discussing possible measures at a summit meeting next week. 
 ''We would want to have a tough translation of the resolution,'' said Gerard Araud, the French envoy to the United Nations.
 But Iran has defied repeated demands from the Security Council to stop enriching nuclear fuel, and immediately vowed to disregard the new sanctions as well. Despite earlier resolutions, Iran has built new, sometimes secret, centrifuge plants needed to enrich uranium -- and has enriched it to higher levels of purity. 
 The main thrust of the sanctions is against military purchases, trade and financial transactions carried out by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, which controls the nuclear program and has taken a more central role in running the country and the economy. Though Iran insists that its efforts are strictly for peaceful purposes, its actions have raised suspicions in the West. On Wednesday, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton warned that Iran's leaders were actively weighing whether to develop a nuclear weapon. 
 ''Whether or not there should be a move toward a breakout capacity or toward weapons, there is a lot of debate within the leadership,'' Mrs. Clinton said, without providing evidence.
 Diplomats from Brazil and Turkey, which negotiated a deal with Iran last month to send some of its low-enriched uranium abroad in exchange for access to fuel for a medical reactor, criticized the sanctions as derailing a fresh chance for diplomacy. 
 ''We do not see sanctions as an effective instrument in this case,'' said Maria Luiza Ribeiro Viotti, Brazil's representative to the United Nations.
 The five permanent members of the Security Council issued a separate statement emphasizing that diplomacy remained an important option, and Mr. Obama, in a lengthy statement at the White House, left the door open to negotiations. 
 ''This day was not inevitable,'' he said. ''We made clear from the beginning of my administration that the United States was prepared to pursue diplomatic solutions,'' arguing that the Iranian leadership had refused to engage.
 Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, offered few indications of being swayed by the current resolution, saying during a visit to Tajikistan that sanctions are ''annoying flies, like a used tissue.'' 
 Iran's envoy to the United Nations, Mohammad Khazaee, also enumerated a long list of grievances over what he called outside interference in Iranian affairs, vowing before the Security Council that Iran would ''never bow.''
 In addition to concentrating on activity by the Revolutionary Guards, the sanctions tighten measures previously taken against 40 individuals, putting them under a travel ban and asset freeze, but the resolution adds just one name to the list -- Javad Rahiqi, 56, the head of the Isfahan Nuclear Technology Center.
 The sanctions require countries to inspect ships or planes headed to or from Iran if they suspect banned cargo is aboard, but there is no authorization to board ships by force at sea. Iran has also proved itself adept at obscuring its ownership of cargo vessels.
 Another aspect of the sanctions bars all countries from allowing Iran to invest in their nuclear enrichment plants, uranium mines and other nuclear-related technology, and sets up a new committee to monitor enforcement. 
 The United States had sought broader measures against Iran's banks, insurance industry and other trade, but China and Russia were adamant that the sanctions not affect Iran's day-to-day economy. Washington and Beijing were wrangling down to the last day over which banks to include on the list, diplomats said, and in the end only one appeared on the list of 40 new companies to be blacklisted. 
 The Chinese ambassador, Li Baodong, said his country's conditions on the sanctions were that they not harm the world economic recovery and not affect the Iranian people or normal trade. 
 ''With time, we got a resolution that we felt was very meaningful and credible and significant,'' said Susan E. Rice, the United States ambassador to the United Nations. ''But had we wanted a low-ball, low-impact resolution, we could have had that in a very short period of time.''
 In the end, both Iran's energy sector and its central bank were mentioned with somewhat tortured wording in the opening paragraphs. But administration officials said that buried in the resolution were specific phrases -- they called them ''hooks'' -- that would provide a legal basis for European and other nations to impose tougher, broader sanctions than many Security Council members were willing to adopt.
 The new sanctions also ban selling Iran heavy weapons, specifically battle tanks, armored combat vehicles, large caliber artillery systems, combat aircraft, attack helicopters, warships, missiles and missile systems. 
 ''Nobody is suggesting that these sanctions are not going to have an impact,'' said Ray Takeyh, an Iran expert at the Council on Foreign Relations. ''The question is whether they will put sufficient pressure on Iran to come back to the negotiating table in a more earnest and a more compromising mood.'' 
 Mr. Takeyh questioned whether measures like the weapons ban could have the unintended consequence of driving Iran toward developing a nuclear weapon because it could not get other arms. 
 On the economic front, studies by the United States government have cast doubt on the efficacy of sanctions, and the World Trade Organization's Web site indicates that major buyers of Iranian exports include Japan, the European Union, China and India.
 ''Not too shabby for an alleged pariah state,'' said Steven E. Miller, the director of the International Security Program at Harvard University's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs. ''It does sort of raise the question of who exactly we are persuading with our relentless campaign to isolate Iran.'' 
 Restricting a few dozen additional companies ''would seem like a thin reed on which to base a policy,'' Mr. Miller added. ''I think that by default we end up with sanctions because we don't know what else to do.''

HEADLINE: Results of Nevada Primary Set Up Senate Race of Sharp Contrasts

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
Even among the nation's most febrile political contests, few choices are as stark as the one Nevada voters will make between a circumspect four-term senator, one of the most visible emblems of Democratic power in Washington, and a largely unknown former state lawmaker with 10 grandchildren, whose fondness for weightlifting and for her .44 Magnum won the ardor of the Republican Party base. 
 Faced with the newly minted Republican Party candidate, Sharron Angle, the senator, Harry Reid, who is the majority leader, will now have to contend with a highly unpredictable electorate. It's one that handed Barack Obama an overwhelming victory in 2008, but now burdened with a protracted recession and ever-relishing its role as national political barometer, has begun this season to demonstrate its ire against incumbents.
 So far, Ms. Angle's base of operations has been limited largely to her Reno living room, where a group called the ''lick 'n' stickers'' meets each week to run her grass-roots network. And, voter registration numbers work in Mr. Reid's favor; there are 579,750 registered Democrats in the state versus 468,245 Republicans. He is also clearly counting on the aggressive Democratic political operation that helped Mr. Obama win a state that has leaned Republican in recent years. 
 Further, Ms. Angle -- the Tea Party-blessed candidate who bested her two better-financed competitors in Tuesday's primary -- is an untested statewide candidate whose positions as a lawmaker put her firmly to the right of most mainstream Nevada voters. The hot lights of national exposure can be a liability for new -- and overly loquacious -- candidates, as Rand Paul, the Republican Senate nominee from Kentucky, quickly found.
 Yet Ms. Angle is well positioned to use Mr. Reid's deep connections with the Obama machine against him in a state where the president's popularity has faltered over the last year and where the demonstration of independence is a badge of honor. 
 History would suggest that a victory in November for Ms. Angle is far from impossible. She will be aided by Mr. Reid's role as the highly visible symbol for what critics in Nevada, one of the most economically hard-hit states, see as the Obama administration's fiscal overreach. In 1982, a four-term incumbent, Senator Howard Cannon, whose power, while less than Mr. Reid's, was not insignificant in Washington, lost his Senate seat during a recession to Chic Hecht, a Republican who leaned hard to the right. 
 In this quintessential swing state, anything truly goes. 
 ''Angle can beat Reid if she can avoid being defined as too right-wing even for conservatives, which, given her history, will be hard for her to avoid,'' said Michael Green, a professor of history at the College of Southern Nevada. ''If even worse economic news came out, it presumably could help her.''
 Largely unknown outside her legislative district in Reno until she began her Senate campaign, Ms. Angle has seen her political positions come into sharp relief in recent weeks, illuminated by her votes, the legislation she sponsored and her campaigns during her time as a state assemblywoman from 1998 to 2006.
 Among her detractors and her supporters she is known as a far-right conservative and a thorn in the side of both parties, routinely voting no on almost everything that came before the Legislature. She is also a tireless campaigner. When a 2002 redistricting forced her to face off with a wildly popular Republican incumbent, Greg Brower, she went door to door nightly, won and ended his political career. 
 ''In the building we used to have a joke called 41 to Angle,'' said Sheila Leslie, a Democratic assemblywoman from Reno who served with Ms. Angle. ''She took great pride in voting no for everything. We have some very conservative people in the assembly, but she was the only one voting no on a technical cleanup bill. The lobbyists didn't talk to her, the legislators wouldn't talk to her, because when you vote no on everything no one wants to deal with you.''
 She was best known for sponsoring an unsuccessful bill that would have required the ''dissemination of information concerning the scientific link between induced abortion and increased rate of breast cancer.'' 
 Several calls to her spokesman, Jerry Stacy, were not unreturned, and then his cellphone voice-mail box shut down. The Web site sharronangle.com was broken much of the day.
 Many of her positions -- she favors the privatization of Medicare and Social Security, supported a program based on Scientology that would have offered massages to some prison inmates and did not support unemployment insurance in a state with among the highest jobless rates in the nation -- have alienated Republicans as well. 
 ''I would say there are a lot of Republicans who will find it difficult to support Sharron Angle,'' said State Senator William J Raggio, a Republican who has served in the Legislature since 1972. ''Abolishing the Department of Education, phasing out Social Security, those are pretty extreme positions. I think any incumbent is vulnerable, but you have to have somebody that is also acceptable if you're going to win.''
 Ms. Angle has long demonstrated larger ambitions. In 2006, she barely lost her primary race for Congress against Secretary of State Dean Heller, and in 2008 she tried to take on Mr. Raggio, one of the most powerful Republicans in the state, both times with scant money in her campaign coffers. 
 When the party's greatest hope for beating Mr. Reid, Sue Lowden, imploded in a sea of gaffes and split some of the vote with a third competitor, Danny Tarkanian, Ms. Angle, 60, at last found her spot on a statewide ticket Tuesday night.
 Ms. Angle's tenacious ways may give Mr. Reid a headache. 
 ''She just pounds the pavement,'' said Don Gustavson, a fellow Republican assemblyman from Sparks. ''I don't care where she goes, she is always the last one to leave the room. She has a house full of volunteers who meet in her living room every week called the lick 'n' stick group. She campaigns in that truck of hers and just works hard.''
 Frank Bushey, pastor of Fellowship Community Church, a Southern Baptist church in Reno where Ms. Angle has been a member for several years, said, ''Sharron is a great lady.''
 Mr. Bushey said that his church was ''mostly blue collar'' and that Ms. Angle's husband had been a deacon for many years, while she sometimes taught women's classes.
 ''She is a godly woman,'' he said. ''She has all the attributes of Jesus.''

HEADLINE: Where Bands Jam, but Traffic Flows

BYLINE: By BEN SISARIO

 BODY:
MANCHESTER, Tenn. -- In a warehouse next to his home, David Pennington, the mayor of Coffee County, stores enough pop-culture memorabilia to make a lesser collector gasp. There are entire walls of Gene Autry items, faded Coca-Cola signs hanging from the ceilings and rare baseball cards in a glass display case. Stashed throughout are reams of posters, tickets and magazine clippings for the Bonnaroo Music & Arts Festival, which begins its ninth season on Thursday and is the pride of this bucolic small city in central Tennessee.
 Especially dear to his heart is an unused ticket to Woodstock in 1969. Mr. Pennington, 60, keeps it to commemorate the trip he canceled to take care of his young family. But it also represents Bonnaroo's dual ambitions: to be a cultural touchstone known around the world, yet -- unlike Woodstock -- to be efficiently run, with smoothly flowing Interstate traffic. The festival found fame at the start, but after a traffic-clogged first couple of years, many people here say the goal of efficiency has largely been achieved. 
 ''They've got it down to a science,'' said Mr. Pennington, who also owns a restaurant offering a rather more congestive Bonnaroo Burger, topped with an egg and two slices of bacon. ''They've got a traffic person that knows just what they're doing. They get those people in, and everybody around here just operates as usual. You don't even know they're out there. You'll see.''
 This year Bonnaroo will feature more than 100 acts through Sunday, among them the Dave Matthews Band, Stevie Wonder, Jay-Z, Norah Jones and Kings of Leon. Past Bonnaroos have attracted up to 90,000 fans; although it has not yet sold out this year, more than 75,000 people are expected, according to Ashley Capps, one of the promoters. Tickets for the full weekend are $250. From Friday to Sunday both YouTubeand the NPR Music Web site will be streaming performances.
 Such big numbers usually lead to traffic nightmares, which is just what happened in Bonnaroo's first year, 2002. Festival organizers warned officials about a tide of tens of thousands of cars. But since a previous festival, Itchycoo Park, had been a flop, and Bonnaroo's marketing and ticket sales had all been online, with no traditional advertising, no one in town took its claims seriously. ''Bonnaroo gave us fair warning, and we just laughed at them,'' Mr. Pennington said.
 Since then the festival has worked out an extensive traffic plan with the state and local police, involving a temporary exit and dedicated festival lanes on Interstate 24, as well as a helicopter to guide the parking staff on the ground. ''We got it down,'' said Steve Graves, the sheriff of Coffee County, which includes Manchester and has a population of about 52,000.
 A 2005 study by two professors at the Middle Tennessee State University found that Bonnaroo contributed about $18 million to the local economy, and Mr. Pennington estimates that since then it has grown to more than $20 million. Signs welcoming Bonnaroo fans hang in stores throughout Manchester, and tie-dyed Bonnaroo T-shirts can be spotted underneath waitresses' aprons and Wal-Mart clerks' uniforms.
 Three years ago Bonnaroo's promoters bought most of the land on the site, a former farm, and they plan to stage more events there during the 361 non-Bonnaroo days of the year. Mr. Pennington said he hopes they will serve as an anchor to attract more music-related businesses to the area.
 ''I see the music industry as something we can tap into here in Manchester,'' he said. ''The recording artists, the recording studios, the songwriters. Not as big as Nashville, obviously, but that's the new industry that we want here. And with Bonnaroo here, that makes a difference.''
 Mr. Capps, the promoter, said that Bonnaroo's biggest challenge is maintaining a strong identity in the face of competition from other festivals around the country, like Lollapalooza in Chicago and Coachella in Southern California. They, as well as many other smaller but still significant events, are all bidding for the same acts and trying to attract out-of-town fans.
 ''It's something that we're conscious of every year,'' Mr. Capps said. ''How do we maintain the thread and be true to the core of what the Bonnaroo experience is without repeating ourselves year after year after year?''
 Bonnaroo's core might have as much to do with its audience as the music. The festival grew out of the post-hippie jam-band scene, which has traditionally been an open-minded, loyal and not terribly fickle audience: an ideal constituency for an annual festival that relies on repeat customers. Over the years Bonnaroo has served as a kind of training ground for bands to return again and again, to ever bigger crowds. Kings of Leon, for example, has played there three times before.
 By Tuesday evening the pilgrims had begun to arrive in Manchester, with drum circles forming in the Wal-Mart parking lot and teams of dreadlocked, flip-flop-wearing fans taking turns going in the store to stock up on beer, comfort food and rubber boots. (The weather forecast called for plenty of rain.)
 Steve Willis, a 59-year-old mail carrier from Manchester, shopping at the Wal-Mart, praised the festival and local authorities for keeping the traffic flowing as well as can be done. The roads, although slow at the beginning and end of the festival, are navigable. ''It's kind of hard to get around some times,'' he said. ''It's a little bit of a hindrance, but it's not a big deal.''
 His wife, Donna, 54, looked out over the Wal-Mart parking lot as the sun went down.
 ''I think it's wonderful,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Tight Credit Is Turning Franchisers Into Lenders

BYLINE: By KERMIT PATTISON

 BODY:
When Remi Tessier recently decided to open a pizza franchise, he got a big surprise: it was not going to be easy to get financing from a bank.
 Mr. Tessier had owned a liquor store for nearly a decade. He had a good credit score and a solid track record as a businessman in central Georgia. He assumed lenders would be happy to help. ''I went to several banks and they acted like they could do loans,'' Mr. Tessier said. ''But when it came down to it, it was ridiculous. Ultimately, the terms and conditions were just outrageous.''
 So Mr. Tessier turned to another source of capital, his franchiser. He financed the $250,000 cost of opening his pizza restaurant though a leasing program established by Marco's Pizza to help franchisees unable to obtain traditional loans. The case is one example of a trend that is rattling the chains of franchising: facing a $3.4 billion credit shortfall, franchisers are trying to spur growth by offering franchisees new financing approaches and incentives. 
 ''When you talk to anybody in the franchising industry, financing is the No. 1 concern,'' said Sean Fitzgerald, vice president for franchise development at Wireless Zone, a cellphone retailer that has introduced in-house financing programs to cover part of its franchise fee and opening costs. ''And it's not going to get better anytime soon.''
 Chains are facing the worst credit squeeze since the franchise model boomed in the years after World War II. This year, the franchise industry is expected to seek $10.1 billion in capital, but banks are expected to lend only $6.7 billion, according to the International Franchise Association.
 The big national companies that dominated franchise lending before the 2008 collapse have stopped or reduced financing. The remaining lenders -- often local banks -- have been more restrictive in their credit underwriting, and they have been demanding more collateral (like home equity), more cash liquidity, more experience in the industry and outside sources of income, like rental income or a working spouse.
 ''Banks have hit the reset button,'' said Reginald Heard, president and chief executive of Bankers One Capital, a company in Danbury, Conn., that specializes in financing franchises. ''They're just holding onto capital and being conservative on how they approach new deals going forward. The franchisee who left I.B.M. and now wants to open a Dunkin' Donuts or Subway, those deals are a lot more challenging to get done.''
 Robert C. Seiwert, senior vice president of the American Bankers Association, said the tighter credit standards affected first-time franchisees in particular (especially those trying riskier ventures like restaurants). Beyond the concerns about lacking collateral, experience and cash flow, lenders are often wary of franchisees who are unable or unwilling to make a large equity investment in their business. And lenders are likely to be especially cautious with newer chains that lack a track record.
 That is why the franchisers are getting involved, Mr. Seiwert said. ''Financing for franchisees has always been tough,'' he said. ''But in today's economy, it's even tougher.''
 Some franchisers have gone a step further and put their own balance sheets to work by creating captive financing programs, pooled credit support or leasing programs. Others have tried ''credit enhancement'' in which the franchiser guarantees part of a loan to encourage tight-fisted lenders to free capital. Some franchisers are submitting themselves to the bank credit report process -- essentially getting their credit-risk language translated into banking terms -- so that franchisees have a lender-friendly package ready to take to banks that might have never seen a loan application from a particular chain. 
 Besides financing, many franchises have also taken steps to help potential franchisees by reducing fees, waiving royalties or reducing square-footage requirements. Whatever the tactic, the motive is the same: playing a more active role in helping franchisees gain access to capital. ''We had to get into the financing space to be able to deliver a solution to our franchisees,'' said Peter Taunton, founder and chief executive of Snap Fitness, a national gym chain based in Chanhassen, Minn.
 Marco's Pizza is one of the most aggressive franchisers. A 200-store chain based in Toledo, Ohio, Marco's has ambitions to grow fivefold in the next five years. Those plans -- which will require $100 million in capital -- ran into a major roadblock when banks curtailed lending. So Marco's has introduced three financing programs.
 It assembled a group of investors and created a $5 million private equity fund for new pizzerias and invests up to $100,000 per restaurant. It formed a subsidiary called Marco's Assurance that provides a limited guarantee of bank loans to its franchisees and pays to relocate stores that end up in bad locations. It also has a leasing program that will finance up to $200,000 in opening costs. ''Any small businessman is going to be very challenged getting financing without franchiser assistance,'' said Ken Switzer, chief financial officer of Marco's Franchising. ''It's virtually impossible on their own, without our help.''
 That is what Remi Tessier found. After 10 years in the liquor business and four children, he had decided he wanted to switch to a more family-friendly business. Pizza seemed a good bet because he thought it was recession-proof. At least that is what he thought until he tried to get financing.
 A decade earlier, he had obtained a business loan for his liquor store with 10 percent down. When he decided to open a 1,600-square-foot Marco's Pizza franchise in Warner Robins, Ga., he assumed he was a better candidate for a loan with $300,000 in the bank, $9,000 monthly income from the sale of his liquor store and a credit score around 800.
 But Mr. Tessier said the lenders told him they had tightened policies and were willing to finance only the equipment for a five-year term. That would force him to reach into his own pocket for $150,000 for renovations, franchise fees and other expenses. ''I thought it was going to be a cakewalk,'' he said. ''I was just shocked at how tough it was.''
 So he turned to the franchisers of Marco's Pizza and applied for its leasing and assurance programs. He financed the $250,000 cost of opening his store by putting 25 percent down and will repay the rest to his franchiser over eight years. ''I was approved within a week,'' he said. In April, he opened the first of three planned locations.
 Few companies have been as aggressive as Marco's. But Darrell Johnson, president and chief executive of FRANdata, a leading franchise analysis business, predicted that the tighter lending environment would impose a new form of natural selection on franchisers. Until recently, financing has been available to both poor performers and high performers, but it will increasingly favor the latter. To survive, he said, franchisers need to ''think like bankers.''
 ''Banks are defining who can play and who can't play on the basis of risk analysis,'' Mr. Johnson said. The stronger franchisers ''are going to survive and do well because they're going to get access to capital,'' he said. ''But it's going to require the performance of franchise systems to change to meet the standards that banks are requiring. It's going to be a system-strengthening process.''

HEADLINE: How Failure Became an Option

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN

 BODY:
Needing a break from the omnipresent BP oil cam, I went back and watched the spirit-resuscitating''Apollo 13.''Oh, to revel in the days when we could fix anything with duct tape and American self-confidence! Sad to say, it looks like a time capsule.
 This is the film about the crippled lunar flight of 1970 that gave us two of the most iconic lines of our culture: ''Houston, we have a problem'' and ''failure is not an option.'' Turns out, the first line is a slight variation of the actual spoken words, and the second sentence was not part of the historical transcript. But it is part of our self-image. 
 In the real flight, as in the movie, our boys jury-rigged a lifeline to their lunar module, and then used what little power they had on a precision-shot to get their tiny craft back home.
 Watching BP's hapless attempts to contain the nation's worst oil spill - from blind reliance on a faulty blowout preventer to deployment of a useless 280,000-pound container dome to the bizarre top kill of golf balls and mud - I wondered what happened to American ingenuity. Yes, I know, they're Brits. But it's our spill, in our waters, from a well that was cemented by Halliburton, the Texas company that Dick Cheney ran before Big Oil moved into the White House.
 Here, this cancer is killing a vast and diverse marine ecosystem, and the best petroleum engineers of the day seem helpless. As ''Apollo 13'' showed, we don't do helpless. But with this spill, we are helpless - by deliberate design.
 The drilling operation in the Gulf of Mexico was supposed to represent some of the most advanced technology on the planet. It was so advanced that BP and other big oil companies were exempted in 2008 from filing a plan on how they would clean up a major spill. They had no fire department because, well, there would never be a fire, silly.
 The reasoning was, BP was too big, too advanced, to fail. Plus, voluntary regulation, the oil companies claimed, was working fine. If that sounds familiar, it was the same argument heard just before the financial crisis. The derivatives and collateralized debt obligations that Wall Street used to make unprecedented profits and then nearly bring down the economy were too big, too advanced for anyone to understand.
 But, in both cases, the stage was set for catastrophic failure, and, in both cases, you can pinpoint two likely causes.
 First, size. In the search for end-stage oil, companies have had to go deeper and further in ever-riskier gambits to pull this gooey fossil fuel from its ancient slumber. The easy oil era is long over. In the new era, monster rigs such as the Deepwater Horizon go a mile below the surface, and then reach another 20,000 feet below the ocean floor.
 The soul of this new machine is unknowable. To slow it down, as BP should have done when trouble first appeared in the line, is too costly. And because of its size and complexity, there are no easy, manual fixes in the event of a disaster. When its fail-safe device, the blowout preventer, did not work, there was no human fallback - not even a plan, as it turned out. Failure was the only option.
 Second, consider the consequence of a huge oil leak. If the crew of Apollo 13 had failed, they would have lost their lives. BP had only to look at Exxon. After the worst oil spill in American history, Exxon spent nearly two decades trying to game a legal system that should have brought them to within an inch of their corporate life.
 In the end, Exxon prevailed. The Supreme Court of John Roberts, a compliant pet of the corporate world, ruled for Big Oil. The original jury award of $5 billion ended up being around $500 million - a few days' earnings. Exxon flourished beyond its dreams, reporting in 2008 the largest annual profit for an American company in history.
 Similarly, the Wall Street titans who crashed the American economy did not go to jail, or even give up their gilded cocoons. They were rewarded with federal bailouts, and by Christmas of last year, bonuses were back, as if nothing had happened.
 It's not too late to reverse this trend. Congress could pass the Big Oil Bailout Prevention Act, which would raise liability caps in a spill from the laughable level of $75 million to $10 billion. That would sting. There is a real possibility that BP could go bankrupt. That would set off alarms in every boardroom. And somebody on Wall Street might still see the inside of a prison.
 What's needed is the return of a basic law of nature, the one used by those Apollo heroes to get home: gravity.
 This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

 Some franchisers have gone a step further and put their own balance sheets to work by creating captive financing programs, pooled credit support or leasing programs. Others have tried ''credit enhancement'' in which the franchiser guarantees part of a loan to encourage tight-fisted lenders to free capital. Some franchisers are submitting themselves to the bank credit report process -- essentially getting their credit-risk language translated into banking terms -- so that franchisees have a lender-friendly package ready to take to banks that might have never seen a loan application from a particular chain. 
 Besides financing, many franchises have also taken steps to help potential franchisees by reducing fees, waiving royalties or reducing square-footage requirements. Whatever the tactic, the motive is the same: playing a more active role in helping franchisees gain access to capital. ''We had to get into the financing space to be able to deliver a solution to our franchisees,'' said Peter Taunton, founder and chief executive of Snap Fitness, a national gym chain based in Chanhassen, Minn.
 Marco's Pizza is one of the most aggressive franchisers. A 200-store chain based in Toledo, Ohio, Marco's has ambitions to grow fivefold in the next five years. Those plans -- which will require $100 million in capital -- ran into a major roadblock when banks curtailed lending. So Marco's has introduced three financing programs.
 It assembled a group of investors and created a $5 million private equity fund for new pizzerias and invests up to $100,000 per restaurant. It formed a subsidiary called Marco's Assurance that provides a limited guarantee of bank loans to its franchisees and pays to relocate stores that end up in bad locations. It also has a leasing program that will finance up to $200,000 in opening costs. ''Any small businessman is going to be very challenged getting financing without franchiser assistance,'' said Ken Switzer, chief financial officer of Marco's Franchising. ''It's virtually impossible on their own, without our help.''
 That is what Remi Tessier found. After 10 years in the liquor business and four children, he had decided he wanted to switch to a more family-friendly business. Pizza seemed a good bet because he thought it was recession-proof. At least that is what he thought until he tried to get financing.
 A decade earlier, he had obtained a business loan for his liquor store with 10 percent down. When he decided to open a 1,600-square-foot Marco's Pizza franchise in Warner Robins, Ga., he assumed he was a better candidate for a loan with $300,000 in the bank, $9,000 monthly income from the sale of his liquor store and a credit score around 800.
 But Mr. Tessier said the lenders told him they had tightened policies and were willing to finance only the equipment for a five-year term. That would force him to reach into his own pocket for $150,000 for renovations, franchise fees and other expenses. ''I thought it was going to be a cakewalk,'' he said. ''I was just shocked at how tough it was.''
 So he turned to the franchisers of Marco's Pizza and applied for its leasing and assurance programs. He financed the $250,000 cost of opening his store by putting 25 percent down and will repay the rest to his franchiser over eight years. ''I was approved within a week,'' he said. In April, he opened the first of three planned locations.
 Few companies have been as aggressive as Marco's. But Darrell Johnson, president and chief executive of FRANdata, a leading franchise analysis business, predicted that the tighter lending environment would impose a new form of natural selection on franchisers. Until recently, financing has been available to both poor performers and high performers, but it will increasingly favor the latter. To survive, he said, franchisers need to ''think like bankers.''
 ''Banks are defining who can play and who can't play on the basis of risk analysis,'' Mr. Johnson said. The stronger franchisers ''are going to survive and do well because they're going to get access to capital,'' he said. ''But it's going to require the performance of franchise systems to change to meet the standards that banks are requiring. It's going to be a system-strengthening process.''

HEADLINE: Where Bands Jam, but Traffic Flows

BYLINE: By BEN SISARIO

 BODY:
MANCHESTER, Tenn. -- In a warehouse next to his home, David Pennington, the mayor of Coffee County, stores enough pop-culture memorabilia to make a lesser collector gasp. There are entire walls of Gene Autry items, faded Coca-Cola signs hanging from the ceilings and rare baseball cards in a glass display case. Stashed throughout are reams of posters, tickets and magazine clippings for the Bonnaroo Music & Arts Festival, which begins its ninth season on Thursday and is the pride of this bucolic small city in central Tennessee.
 Especially dear to his heart is an unused ticket to Woodstock in 1969. Mr. Pennington, 60, keeps it to commemorate the trip he canceled to take care of his young family. But it also represents Bonnaroo's dual ambitions: to be a cultural touchstone known around the world, yet -- unlike Woodstock -- to be efficiently run, with smoothly flowing Interstate traffic. The festival found fame at the start, but after a traffic-clogged first couple of years, many people here say the goal of efficiency has largely been achieved. 
 ''They've got it down to a science,'' said Mr. Pennington, who also owns a restaurant offering a rather more congestive Bonnaroo Burger, topped with an egg and two slices of bacon. ''They've got a traffic person that knows just what they're doing. They get those people in, and everybody around here just operates as usual. You don't even know they're out there. You'll see.''
 This year Bonnaroo will feature more than 100 acts through Sunday, among them the Dave Matthews Band, Stevie Wonder, Jay-Z, Norah Jones and Kings of Leon. Past Bonnaroos have attracted up to 90,000 fans; although it has not yet sold out this year, more than 75,000 people are expected, according to Ashley Capps, one of the promoters. Tickets for the full weekend are $250. From Friday to Sunday both YouTubeand the NPR Music Web site will be streaming performances.
 Such big numbers usually lead to traffic nightmares, which is just what happened in Bonnaroo's first year, 2002. Festival organizers warned officials about a tide of tens of thousands of cars. But since a previous festival, Itchycoo Park, had been a flop, and Bonnaroo's marketing and ticket sales had all been online, with no traditional advertising, no one in town took its claims seriously. ''Bonnaroo gave us fair warning, and we just laughed at them,'' Mr. Pennington said.
 Since then the festival has worked out an extensive traffic plan with the state and local police, involving a temporary exit and dedicated festival lanes on Interstate 24, as well as a helicopter to guide the parking staff on the ground. ''We got it down,'' said Steve Graves, the sheriff of Coffee County, which includes Manchester and has a population of about 52,000.
 A 2005 study by two professors at the Middle Tennessee State University found that Bonnaroo contributed about $18 million to the local economy, and Mr. Pennington estimates that since then it has grown to more than $20 million. Signs welcoming Bonnaroo fans hang in stores throughout Manchester, and tie-dyed Bonnaroo T-shirts can be spotted underneath waitresses' aprons and Wal-Mart clerks' uniforms.
 Three years ago Bonnaroo's promoters bought most of the land on the site, a former farm, and they plan to stage more events there during the 361 non-Bonnaroo days of the year. Mr. Pennington said he hopes they will serve as an anchor to attract more music-related businesses to the area.
 ''I see the music industry as something we can tap into here in Manchester,'' he said. ''The recording artists, the recording studios, the songwriters. Not as big as Nashville, obviously, but that's the new industry that we want here. And with Bonnaroo here, that makes a difference.''
 Mr. Capps, the promoter, said that Bonnaroo's biggest challenge is maintaining a strong identity in the face of competition from other festivals around the country, like Lollapalooza in Chicago and Coachella in Southern California. They, as well as many other smaller but still significant events, are all bidding for the same acts and trying to attract out-of-town fans.
 ''It's something that we're conscious of every year,'' Mr. Capps said. ''How do we maintain the thread and be true to the core of what the Bonnaroo experience is without repeating ourselves year after year after year?''
 Bonnaroo's core might have as much to do with its audience as the music. The festival grew out of the post-hippie jam-band scene, which has traditionally been an open-minded, loyal and not terribly fickle audience: an ideal constituency for an annual festival that relies on repeat customers. Over the years Bonnaroo has served as a kind of training ground for bands to return again and again, to ever bigger crowds. Kings of Leon, for example, has played there three times before.
 By Tuesday evening the pilgrims had begun to arrive in Manchester, with drum circles forming in the Wal-Mart parking lot and teams of dreadlocked, flip-flop-wearing fans taking turns going in the store to stock up on beer, comfort food and rubber boots. (The weather forecast called for plenty of rain.)
 Steve Willis, a 59-year-old mail carrier from Manchester, shopping at the Wal-Mart, praised the festival and local authorities for keeping the traffic flowing as well as can be done. The roads, although slow at the beginning and end of the festival, are navigable. ''It's kind of hard to get around some times,'' he said. ''It's a little bit of a hindrance, but it's not a big deal.''
 His wife, Donna, 54, looked out over the Wal-Mart parking lot as the sun went down.
 ''I think it's wonderful,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Tight Credit Is Turning Franchisers Into Lenders

BYLINE: By KERMIT PATTISON

 BODY:
When Remi Tessier recently decided to open a pizza franchise, he got a big surprise: it was not going to be easy to get financing from a bank.
 Mr. Tessier had owned a liquor store for nearly a decade. He had a good credit score and a solid track record as a businessman in central Georgia. He assumed lenders would be happy to help. ''I went to several banks and they acted like they could do loans,'' Mr. Tessier said. ''But when it came down to it, it was ridiculous. Ultimately, the terms and conditions were just outrageous.''
 So Mr. Tessier turned to another source of capital, his franchiser. He financed the $250,000 cost of opening his pizza restaurant though a leasing program established by Marco's Pizza to help franchisees unable to obtain traditional loans. The case is one example of a trend that is rattling the chains of franchising: facing a $3.4 billion credit shortfall, franchisers are trying to spur growth by offering franchisees new financing approaches and incentives. 
 ''When you talk to anybody in the franchising industry, financing is the No. 1 concern,'' said Sean Fitzgerald, vice president for franchise development at Wireless Zone, a cellphone retailer that has introduced in-house financing programs to cover part of its franchise fee and opening costs. ''And it's not going to get better anytime soon.''
 Chains are facing the worst credit squeeze since the franchise model boomed in the years after World War II. This year, the franchise industry is expected to seek $10.1 billion in capital, but banks are expected to lend only $6.7 billion, according to the International Franchise Association.
 The big national companies that dominated franchise lending before the 2008 collapse have stopped or reduced financing. The remaining lenders -- often local banks -- have been more restrictive in their credit underwriting, and they have been demanding more collateral (like home equity), more cash liquidity, more experience in the industry and outside sources of income, like rental income or a working spouse.
 ''Banks have hit the reset button,'' said Reginald Heard, president and chief executive of Bankers One Capital, a company in Danbury, Conn., that specializes in financing franchises. ''They're just holding onto capital and being conservative on how they approach new deals going forward. The franchisee who left I.B.M. and now wants to open a Dunkin' Donuts or Subway, those deals are a lot more challenging to get done.''
 Robert C. Seiwert, senior vice president of the American Bankers Association, said the tighter credit standards affected first-time franchisees in particular (especially those trying riskier ventures like restaurants). Beyond the concerns about lacking collateral, experience and cash flow, lenders are often wary of franchisees who are unable or unwilling to make a large equity investment in their business. And lenders are likely to be especially cautious with newer chains that lack a track record.
 That is why the franchisers are getting involved, Mr. Seiwert said. ''Financing for franchisees has always been tough,'' he said. ''But in today's economy, it's even tougher.''

''It's virtually impossible on their own, without our help.''
 That is what Remi Tessier found. After 10 years in the liquor business and four children, he had decided he wanted to switch to a more family-friendly business. Pizza seemed a good bet because he thought it was recession-proof. At least that is what he thought until he tried to get financing.
 A decade earlier, he had obtained a business loan for his liquor store with 10 percent down. When he decided to open a 1,600-square-foot Marco's Pizza franchise in Warner Robins, Ga., he assumed he was a better candidate for a loan with $300,000 in the bank, $9,000 monthly income from the sale of his liquor store and a credit score around 800.
 But Mr. Tessier said the lenders told him they had tightened policies and were willing to finance only the equipment for a five-year term. That would force him to reach into his own pocket for $150,000 for renovations, franchise fees and other expenses. ''I thought it was going to be a cakewalk,'' he said. ''I was just shocked at how tough it was.''
 So he turned to the franchisers of Marco's Pizza and applied for its leasing and assurance programs. He financed the $250,000 cost of opening his store by putting 25 percent down and will repay the rest to his franchiser over eight years. ''I was approved within a week,'' he said. In April, he opened the first of three planned locations.
 Few companies have been as aggressive as Marco's. But Darrell Johnson, president and chief executive of FRANdata, a leading franchise analysis business, predicted that the tighter lending environment would impose a new form of natural selection on franchisers. Until recently, financing has been available to both poor performers and high performers, but it will increasingly favor the latter. To survive, he said, franchisers need to ''think like bankers.''
 ''Banks are defining who can play and who can't play on the basis of risk analysis,'' Mr. Johnson said. The stronger franchisers ''are going to survive and do well because they're going to get access to capital,'' he said. ''But it's going to require the performance of franchise systems to change to meet the standards that banks are requiring. It's going to be a system-strengthening process.''

HEADLINE: Where Bands Jam, but Traffic Flows

BYLINE: By BEN SISARIO

 BODY:
MANCHESTER, Tenn. -- In a warehouse next to his home, David Pennington, the mayor of Coffee County, stores enough pop-culture memorabilia to make a lesser collector gasp. There are entire walls of Gene Autry items, faded Coca-Cola signs hanging from the ceilings and rare baseball cards in a glass display case. Stashed throughout are reams of posters, tickets and magazine clippings for the Bonnaroo Music & Arts Festival, which begins its ninth season on Thursday and is the pride of this bucolic small city in central Tennessee.
 Especially dear to his heart is an unused ticket to Woodstock in 1969. Mr. Pennington, 60, keeps it to commemorate the trip he canceled to take care of his young family. But it also represents Bonnaroo's dual ambitions: to be a cultural touchstone known around the world, yet -- unlike Woodstock -- to be efficiently run, with smoothly flowing Interstate traffic. The festival found fame at the start, but after a traffic-clogged first couple of years, many people here say the goal of efficiency has largely been achieved. 
 ''They've got it down to a science,'' said Mr. Pennington, who also owns a restaurant offering a rather more congestive Bonnaroo Burger, topped with an egg and two slices of bacon. ''They've got a traffic person that knows just what they're doing. They get those people in, and everybody around here just operates as usual. You don't even know they're out there. You'll see.''
 This year Bonnaroo will feature more than 100 acts through Sunday, among them the Dave Matthews Band, Stevie Wonder, Jay-Z, Norah Jones and Kings of Leon. Past Bonnaroos have attracted up to 90,000 fans; although it has not yet sold out this year, more than 75,000 people are expected, according to Ashley Capps, one of the promoters. Tickets for the full weekend are $250. From Friday to Sunday both YouTubeand the NPR Music Web site will be streaming performances.
 Such big numbers usually lead to traffic nightmares, which is just what happened in Bonnaroo's first year, 2002. Festival organizers warned officials about a tide of tens of thousands of cars. But since a previous festival, Itchycoo Park, had been a flop, and Bonnaroo's marketing and ticket sales had all been online, with no traditional advertising, no one in town took its claims seriously. ''Bonnaroo gave us fair warning, and we just laughed at them,'' Mr. Pennington said.
 Since then the festival has worked out an extensive traffic plan with the state and local police, involving a temporary exit and dedicated festival lanes on Interstate 24, as well as a helicopter to guide the parking staff on the ground. ''We got it down,'' said Steve Graves, the sheriff of Coffee County, which includes Manchester and has a population of about 52,000.
 A 2005 study by two professors at the Middle Tennessee State University found that Bonnaroo contributed about $18 million to the local economy, and Mr. Pennington estimates that since then it has grown to more than $20 million. Signs welcoming Bonnaroo fans hang in stores throughout Manchester, and tie-dyed Bonnaroo T-shirts can be spotted underneath waitresses' aprons and Wal-Mart clerks' uniforms.
 Three years ago Bonnaroo's promoters bought most of the land on the site, a former farm, and they plan to stage more events there during the 361 non-Bonnaroo days of the year. Mr. Pennington said he hopes they will serve as an anchor to attract more music-related businesses to the area.
 ''I see the music industry as something we can tap into here in Manchester,'' he said. ''The recording artists, the recording studios, the songwriters. Not as big as Nashville, obviously, but that's the new industry that we want here. And with Bonnaroo here, that makes a difference.''
 Mr. Capps, the promoter, said that Bonnaroo's biggest challenge is maintaining a strong identity in the face of competition from other festivals around the country, like Lollapalooza in Chicago and Coachella in Southern California. They, as well as many other smaller but still significant events, are all bidding for the same acts and trying to attract out-of-town fans.
 ''It's something that we're conscious of every year,'' Mr. Capps said. ''How do we maintain the thread and be true to the core of what the Bonnaroo experience is without repeating ourselves year after year after year?''
 Bonnaroo's core might have as much to do with its audience as the music. The festival grew out of the post-hippie jam-band scene, which has traditionally been an open-minded, loyal and not terribly fickle audience: an ideal constituency for an annual festival that relies on repeat customers. Over the years Bonnaroo has served as a kind of training ground for bands to return again and again, to ever bigger crowds. Kings of Leon, for example, has played there three times before.
 By Tuesday evening the pilgrims had begun to arrive in Manchester, with drum circles forming in the Wal-Mart parking lot and teams of dreadlocked, flip-flop-wearing fans taking turns going in the store to stock up on beer, comfort food and rubber boots. (The weather forecast called for plenty of rain.)
 Steve Willis, a 59-year-old mail carrier from Manchester, shopping at the Wal-Mart, praised the festival and local authorities for keeping the traffic flowing as well as can be done. The roads, although slow at the beginning and end of the festival, are navigable. ''It's kind of hard to get around some times,'' he said. ''It's a little bit of a hindrance, but it's not a big deal.''
 His wife, Donna, 54, looked out over the Wal-Mart parking lot as the sun went down.
 ''I think it's wonderful,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Tight Credit Is Turning Franchisers Into Lenders

BYLINE: By KERMIT PATTISON

 BODY:
When Remi Tessier recently decided to open a pizza franchise, he got a big surprise: it was not going to be easy to get financing from a bank.
 Mr. Tessier had owned a liquor store for nearly a decade. He had a good credit score and a solid track record as a businessman in central Georgia. He assumed lenders would be happy to help. ''I went to several banks and they acted like they could do loans,'' Mr. Tessier said. ''But when it came down to it, it was ridiculous. Ultimately, the terms and conditions were just outrageous.''
 So Mr. Tessier turned to another source of capital, his franchiser. He financed the $250,000 cost of opening his pizza restaurant though a leasing program established by Marco's Pizza to help franchisees unable to obtain traditional loans. The case is one example of a trend that is rattling the chains of franchising: facing a $3.4 billion credit shortfall, franchisers are trying to spur growth by offering franchisees new financing approaches and incentives. 
 ''When you talk to anybody in the franchising industry, financing is the No. 1 concern,'' said Sean Fitzgerald, vice president for franchise development at Wireless Zone, a cellphone retailer that has introduced in-house financing programs to cover part of its franchise fee and opening costs. ''And it's not going to get better anytime soon.''
 Chains are facing the worst credit squeeze since the franchise model boomed in the years after World War II. This year, the franchise industry is expected to seek $10.1 billion in capital, but banks are expected to lend only $6.7 billion, according to the International Franchise Association.
 The big national companies that dominated franchise lending before the 2008 collapse have stopped or reduced financing. The remaining lenders -- often local banks -- have been more restrictive in their credit underwriting, and they have been demanding more collateral (like home equity), more cash liquidity, more experience in the industry and outside sources of income, like rental income or a working spouse.
 ''Banks have hit the reset button,'' said Reginald Heard, president and chief executive of Bankers One Capital, a company in Danbury, Conn., that specializes in financing franchises. ''They're just holding onto capital and being conservative on how they approach new deals going forward. The franchisee who left I.B.M. and now wants to open a Dunkin' Donuts or Subway, those deals are a lot more challenging to get done.''
 Robert C. Seiwert, senior vice president of the American Bankers Association, said the tighter credit standards affected first-time franchisees in particular (especially those trying riskier ventures like restaurants). Beyond the concerns about lacking collateral, experience and cash flow, lenders are often wary of franchisees who are unable or unwilling to make a large equity investment in their business. And lenders are likely to be especially cautious with newer chains that lack a track record.
 That is why the franchisers are getting involved, Mr. Seiwert said. ''Financing for franchisees has always been tough,'' he said. ''But in today's economy, it's even tougher.''
 Some franchisers have gone a step further and put their own balance sheets to work by creating captive financing programs, pooled credit support or leasing programs. Others have tried ''credit enhancement'' in which the franchiser guarantees part of a loan to encourage tight-fisted lenders to free capital. Some franchisers are submitting themselves to the bank credit report process -- essentially getting their credit-risk language translated into banking terms -- so that franchisees have a lender-friendly package ready to take to banks that might have never seen a loan application from a particular chain. 
 Besides financing, many franchises have also taken steps to help potential franchisees by reducing fees, waiving royalties or reducing square-footage requirements. Whatever the tactic, the motive is the same: playing a more active role in helping franchisees gain access to capital. ''We had to get into the financing space to be able to deliver a solution to our franchisees,'' said Peter Taunton, founder and chief executive of Snap Fitness, a national gym chain based in Chanhassen, Minn.
 Marco's Pizza is one of the most aggressive franchisers. A 200-store chain based in Toledo, Ohio, Marco's has ambitions to grow fivefold in the next five years. Those plans -- which will require $100 million in capital -- ran into a major roadblock when banks curtailed lending. So Marco's has introduced three financing programs.
 It assembled a group of investors and created a $5 million private equity fund for new pizzerias and invests up to $100,000 per restaurant. It formed a subsidiary called Marco's Assurance that provides a limited guarantee of bank loans to its franchisees and pays to relocate stores that end up in bad locations. It also has a leasing program that will finance up to $200,000 in opening costs. ''Any small businessman is going to be very challenged getting financing without franchiser assistance,'' said Ken Switzer, chief financial officer of Marco's Franchising. ''It's virtually impossible on their own, without our help.''
 That is what Remi Tessier found. After 10 years in the liquor business and four children, he had decided he wanted to switch to a more family-friendly business. Pizza seemed a good bet because he thought it was recession-proof. At least that is what he thought until he tried to get financing.
 A decade earlier, he had obtained a business loan for his liquor store with 10 percent down. When he decided to open a 1,600-square-foot Marco's Pizza franchise in Warner Robins, Ga., he assumed he was a better candidate for a loan with $300,000 in the bank, $9,000 monthly income from the sale of his liquor store and a credit score around 800.
 But Mr. Tessier said the lenders told him they had tightened policies and were willing to finance only the equipment for a five-year term. That would force him to reach into his own pocket for $150,000 for renovations, franchise fees and other expenses. ''I thought it was going to be a cakewalk,'' he said. ''I was just shocked at how tough it was.''

HEADLINE: Aquino to Be Philippine President

BYLINE: By CARLOS H. CONDE

 BODY:
MANILA -- Benigno S. Aquino III was officially proclaimed the next president of the Philippines on Wednesday, vowing to fulfill his campaign promise to fight corruption and to immediately determine the ''true state of the country.'' 
 According to analysts, Mr. Aquino, who will become the 15th president of the republic on June 30, has to meet the expectations of Filipinos as early as he can, and can start by ensuring that fighting corruption remains on his agenda. 
 Those expectations spring almost entirely from his campaign promise to eradicate corruption, a pledge that was bolstered by his invocation of the almost saintly legacy of his parents, former President Corazon C. Aquino and the opposition politician Benigno Aquino Jr. 
 ''If he is to fulfill his promise, obviously the first thing he should do is make sure that his cabinet is not only competent -- it should not be corrupt,'' said Solita Monsod, a professor of economics at the University of the Philippines. ''If he puts in place people who don't know what they're doing, then he is in trouble.'' 
 Corruption and Mr. Aquino's promise to eradicate it were crucial to his victory. According to Pulse Asia, a pollster based in Manila, most voters wanted him to deal with corruption and the high price of basic goods, in that order. 
 At a news conference a few minutes after both houses of the Philippine Congress had proclaimed him the winner of the election held May 10, Mr. Aquino reiterated his vow against corruption, saying that going after smugglers in the Bureau of Customs was one of his priorities. He said he had already identified people who would carry out that campaign. 
 No one disputes Mr. Aquino's sincerity about fulfilling his promise to fight corruption. But he is facing not just a gargantuan problem -- it is estimated by various anticorruption groups and agencies that 30 percent of the national budget goes to corruption -- but the disillusionment of many Filipinos about such promises by politicians in the past. 
 ''Every president comes with glowing pronouncements on ending corruption, poverty and so on, but all these promises wither on the vine over time,'' said Belinda Aquino, a professor of political science at the University of Hawaii at Manoa and author of the book ''Politics of Plunder: The Philippines Under Marcos.'' The people, she said in an e-mail message, ''are tired of the same old rationalizations and excuses.'' 
 Ms. Aquino, who is not related to the president-elect, said that ''fighting corruption is always an uphill battle'' and that Mr. Aquino would have to contend with the same entrenched political elite, like the family of the dictator Ferdinand E. Marcos. 
 ''The new president should not just concentrate on the Arroyo-related corrupt activities, but revisit the hundreds of cases way back against the Marcos cronies and estate, which have been dragging for well over a quarter of a century,'' the professor said, referring to the departing president, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. 
 During his news conference Wednesday, Mr. Aquino said that he was still assembling members of his cabinet. 
 ''Their first marching order would be to know your respective departments and find out exactly the state of the nation,'' Mr. Aquino said, adding that ''there has to be an inventory of the problems.'' 
 As a senator from the political opposition, he was a critic of Mrs. Arroyo and had promised during the campaign to be the opposite of her. 
 In her nearly 10 years in office, Mrs. Arroyo, her family and her officials have been hounded by accusations of corruption and electoral fraud. The political opposition to which Mr. Aquino belonged tried several times to impeach her. 
 One of the areas Mr. Aquino will be forced to confront in his first months in office is the country's budget deficit of 293.2 billion pesos, or $6.3 billion, equivalent to 3.6 percent of gross domestic product, and the high cost of basic commodities, which affects mostly the poor. 
 Ms. Monsod, the economist, said that Mr. Aquino must institute policies that promote ''growth that is inclusive,'' referring to agricultural productivity as an immediate target. ''He has to have pro-poor policies to make sure that growth will benefit the poor,'' she said. 
 Renato Reyes, secretary general of Bayan, a nationalist group that has led many anti-Arroyo protests, said that it expected Mr. Aquino to act swiftly. ''The arduous task of reversing and undoing the many failed policies of the Arroyo regime must begin as soon as possible,'' he said. ''Many positive steps can be taken within the first 100 days of the next administration.'' 
 Mr. Aquino also faces the challenge of achieving the so-called Millennium Development Goals, a set of time-specific objectives that 189 countries, among them the Philippines, committed to during a United Nations summit meeting in 2000. ''While there has been progress in some areas, the country remains off track in more than 40 percent'' of the 21 goals, the United Nations said Tuesday. These are in the areas of poverty and hunger, deaths from pregnancy-related illnesses, and an increase in the incidence of H.I.V. infection among the young. 
 Mr. Aquino will also face a communist insurgency, an Islamist separatist movement, terrorism and a human rights situation that rights groups have compared to the abuses of the Marcos years. 
 ''I'm a little anxious, a little eager to start solving the problems that our countrymen are facing,'' he said Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Ex-C.E.O.'s Show Tech Can Play In Politics

BYLINE: By BRAD STONE

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO -- It is now officially the year of the high-tech chief executive in California electoral politics.
 The high-wattage former Silicon Valley executives Meg Whitman and Carly Fiorina won Republican primary elections Tuesday for two of the state's top jobs, governor and United States senator.
 Though neither candidate is particularly loved in socially left-leaning Silicon Valley, their political ascendancy in many ways signals the maturation of the high-tech industry and its growing interest in controlling its own fortunes by playing a political game it once rejected. 
 ''This is Silicon Valley coming of age,'' said Larry Gerston, a professor of political science at San Jose State University. ''These candidacies are sort of like the latest chapter in the industry's awakening.''
 Ms. Whitman, the longtime chief executive of eBay, soundly defeated a technology entrepreneur, and Carly Fiorina, the former chief of Hewlett-Packard, beat a former congressman.
 Both Ms. Whitman and Ms. Fiorina are, in part, pitching the magic of Silicon Valley. They say they can bring the valley's inventiveness and efficiencies to a government that is swamped by debt and partisan gridlock.
 ''People intuitively believe that executives from Silicon Valley are used to competing and making jobs in the 21st century,'' said Steve Westly, an early eBay executive who became state controller in 2003 and later lost in a Democratic primary for governor. ''The industry is about productivity, and that's appealing to people.''
 While early polls show both women trailing their Democratic opponents -- Ms. Whitman faces Jerry Brown, the attorney general and former governor, and Ms. Fiorina will run against the incumbent Barbara Boxer -- analysts expect the contests to tighten.
 The political engagement of Ms. Whitman and Ms. Fiorina, both first-time candidates, reflects a decade-long turnaround in the valley's attitude toward government.
 High-tech's pioneers once eschewed politics, preferring to focus on the wonky calculus of microchip efficiency. Even today, many valley denizens probably would not be able to place Sacramento on a map if the highway to the ski slopes of Tahoe did not pass right by it.
 ''For a long time, people here were very heads-down,'' said Josh Becker, a venture capitalist from Palo Alto, Calif., who lost a Democratic primary on Tuesday for a state assembly seat. ''They figured they would make it first, and then think about doing something in public service.''
 But over the last decade, as the valley's population of introverted engineers gave way to more sociable business people, the industry started ingratiating itself into politics. Donations from individuals and political action committees in high-tech businesses increased 43 percent between election cycles last decade, according to OpenSecrets.org, to $41.4 million in 2008 from $28.9 million in 2004.
 Google alone has quintupled its lobbying expenditures in recent years, to $4 million last year from $800,000 in 2006.
 The high-tech industry has also lobbied for causes dear to its pocketbook, like the relaxation of accounting rules for selling stock to the public and the fight against the so-called carried interest tax that would penalize venture capitalists.
 Ms. Whitman and Ms. Fiorina are also funneling their plentiful high-tech lucre into their campaigns. Ms. Whitman, whose net worth was recently estimated at $1.3 billion by Forbes magazine, spent $71 million on her own primary campaign, according to public records.
 Estimates of Ms. Fiorina's net worth, based on her financial disclosure forms, have varied but reach as high as $100 million. Ms. Fiorina gave herself loans totaling $5.5 million during the primary.
 While Ms. Whitman and Ms. Fiorina have come to embody Silicon Valley's increased electoral ambitions, neither truly represents its political sensibilities. The two women had actually become somewhat divisive figures in the business community, particularly as they leaned further to the right in their respective primaries on issues like same-sex marriage, immigration and offshore oil drilling.
 For example, at the start of the campaign, Ms. Fiorina surprised former colleagues by declaring herself an opponent of abortion rights.
 Ms. Whitman, largely respected for her tenure between 1998 and 2007 as the eBay chief during its formative years, alienated some supporters in Silicon Valley by calling for a temporary moratorium of California's greenhouse gas reduction legislation.
 Ms. Fiorina mostly draws strident reactions from the Silicon Valley cognoscenti because of her past. Though some say they believe she planted seeds for Hewlett-Packard's current success, many argue that she mismanaged the company during her five-and-a-half-year tenure, before effectively being forced out by H.P.'s board in 2005.
 Tellingly, each candidate had a victory party on Tuesday in Southern California, far from their presumptive homes and closer to the Republican strongholds of Orange County and San Diego.
 Still, some political consultants suggest their ties to high-technology are crucial to their chances against two well-entrenched Democrats.
 ''The technology community has managed to protect itself pretty well from the broader antibusiness sentiment that voters are feeling,'' said Dan Schnur, a Republican strategist and chairman of the state's Fair Political Practices Commission, which monitors political campaigns. ''Both candidates are going to need to keep reminding voters that Silicon Valley is a much different place than Wall Street.''
 But some are still eager to see meaning in what might be called the Meg and Carly moment. ''The innovation economy is not a monolithic thinker that walks in lockstep on every issue,'' said Carl Guardino, president of the Silicon Valley Leadership Group, a consortium of area business executives.
 Mr. Guardino suggests that government is simply the next ecosystem ripe for reinvention, Silicon Valley style. ''If some of these candidate are successful in November, I believe you will see this turn into a much stronger trend,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Ex-C.E.O.'s Show Tech Can Play In Politics

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO -- It is now officially the year of the high-tech chief executive in California electoral politics.
 The high-wattage former Silicon Valley executives Meg Whitman and Carly Fiorina won Republican primary elections Tuesday for two of the state's top jobs, governor and United States senator.
 Though neither candidate is particularly loved in socially left-leaning Silicon Valley, their political ascendancy in many ways signals the maturation of the high-tech industry and its growing interest in controlling its own fortunes by playing a political game it once rejected. 
 ''This is Silicon Valley coming of age,'' said Larry Gerston, a professor of political science at San Jose State University. ''These candidacies are sort of like the latest chapter in the industry's awakening.''
 Ms. Whitman, the longtime chief executive of eBay, soundly defeated a technology entrepreneur, and Carly Fiorina, the former chief of Hewlett-Packard, beat a former congressman.
 Both Ms. Whitman and Ms. Fiorina are, in part, pitching the magic of Silicon Valley. They say they can bring the valley's inventiveness and efficiencies to a government that is swamped by debt and partisan gridlock.
 ''People intuitively believe that executives from Silicon Valley are used to competing and making jobs in the 21st century,'' said Steve Westly, an early eBay executive who became state controller in 2003 and later lost in a Democratic primary for governor. ''The industry is about productivity, and that's appealing to people.''
 While early polls show both women trailing their Democratic opponents -- Ms. Whitman faces Jerry Brown, the attorney general and former governor, and Ms. Fiorina will run against the incumbent Barbara Boxer -- analysts expect the contests to tighten.
 The political engagement of Ms. Whitman and Ms. Fiorina, both first-time candidates, reflects a decade-long turnaround in the valley's attitude toward government.
 High-tech's pioneers once eschewed politics, preferring to focus on the wonky calculus of microchip efficiency. Even today, many valley denizens probably would not be able to place Sacramento on a map if the highway to the ski slopes of Tahoe did not pass right by it.
 ''For a long time, people here were very heads-down,'' said Josh Becker, a venture capitalist from Palo Alto, Calif., who lost a Democratic primary on Tuesday for a state assembly seat. ''They figured they would make it first, and then think about doing something in public service.''
 But over the last decade, as the valley's population of introverted engineers gave way to more sociable business people, the industry started ingratiating itself into politics. Donations from individuals and political action committees in high-tech businesses increased 43 percent between election cycles last decade, according to OpenSecrets.org, to $41.4 million in 2008 from $28.9 million in 2004.
 Google alone has quintupled its lobbying expenditures in recent years, to $4 million last year from $800,000 in 2006.
 The high-tech industry has also lobbied for causes dear to its pocketbook, like the relaxation of accounting rules for selling stock to the public and the fight against the so-called carried interest tax that would penalize venture capitalists.
 Ms. Whitman and Ms. Fiorina are also funneling their plentiful high-tech lucre into their campaigns. Ms. Whitman, whose net worth was recently estimated at $1.3 billion by Forbes magazine, spent $71 million on her own primary campaign, according to public records.
 Estimates of Ms. Fiorina's net worth, based on her financial disclosure forms, have varied but reach as high as $100 million. Ms. Fiorina gave herself loans totaling $5.5 million during the primary.
 While Ms. Whitman and Ms. Fiorina have come to embody Silicon Valley's increased electoral ambitions, neither truly represents its political sensibilities. The two women had actually become somewhat divisive figures in the business community, particularly as they leaned further to the right in their respective primaries on issues like same-sex marriage, immigration and offshore oil drilling.
 For example, at the start of the campaign, Ms. Fiorina surprised former colleagues by declaring herself an opponent of abortion rights.
 Ms. Whitman, largely respected for her tenure between 1998 and 2007 as the eBay chief during its formative years, alienated some supporters in Silicon Valley by calling for a temporary moratorium of California's greenhouse gas reduction legislation.
 Ms. Fiorina mostly draws strident reactions from the Silicon Valley cognoscenti because of her past. Though some say they believe she planted seeds for Hewlett-Packard's current success, many argue that she mismanaged the company during her five-and-a-half-year tenure, before effectively being forced out by H.P.'s board in 2005.
 Tellingly, each candidate had a victory party on Tuesday in Southern California, far from their presumptive homes and closer to the Republican strongholds of Orange County and San Diego.
 Still, some political consultants suggest their ties to high-technology are crucial to their chances against two well-entrenched Democrats.
 ''The technology community has managed to protect itself pretty well from the broader antibusiness sentiment that voters are feeling,'' said Dan Schnur, a Republican strategist and chairman of the state's Fair Political Practices Commission, which monitors political campaigns. ''Both candidates are going to need to keep reminding voters that Silicon Valley is a much different place than Wall Street.''
 But some are still eager to see meaning in what might be called the Meg and Carly moment. ''The innovation economy is not a monolithic thinker that walks in lockstep on every issue,'' said Carl Guardino, president of the Silicon Valley Leadership Group, a consortium of area business executives.
 Mr. Guardino suggests that government is simply the next ecosystem ripe for reinvention, Silicon Valley style. ''If some of these candidate are successful in November, I believe you will see this turn into a much stronger trend,'' he said.

CORRECTION-DATE: June 11, 2010, Friday

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Thursday about the primary election victories of two former Silicon Valley executives, Meg Whitman and Carly Fiorina, misstated Ms. Whitman's position on abortion. She supports abortion rights; she did not, at the start of the campaign, declare herself an opponent of abortion rights.

HEADLINE: Depression-Era Woes, Echoing in the Present

BYLINE: By KEN JAWOROWSKI

 BODY:
There's nothing for sale in the vacant store where ''Can You Hear Their Voices?'' is being performed. No shelves, registers or clerks, either. Yet there's constant talk of money, of business, of labor. The play, a nifty piece of agitprop from the Depression, isn't shy when voicing ideas about the American economy, and this production, as heavy-handed as it sometimes turns, doesn't have to stretch too far to find parallels to current events. 
 First staged in 1931, ''Voices'' was adapted by Hallie Flanagan and Margaret Ellen Clifford from a short story by Whittaker Chambers, who was then an avowed communist. The tale, based on real incidents, documents a group of Dust Bowl farmers and their growing frustration over the lack of a government response to their plight. 
 Throughout the play, scenes of the farmers' suffering alternate with episodes of the decadent rich enjoying lavish lives. One group debates socialism. The other denounces state-run aid. While there is never a question where your sympathies should lie, the script features a few powerful moments, including a final scene that stirs plenty of passion. 
 Rather than heightening such passion, the production, directed by Ralph Lewis and Barry Rowell, unwisely employs a detached approach, using intentionally absurd double-casting and other techniques in a Brechtian attempt to shift focus from the characters' emotions toward a larger vision. Those ill-conceived choices, however, do more to promote a theory than to support the story. 
 Still, the cast of 11, playing more than 30 characters, is capable, particularly Christopher Hurt as Wardell, a farmer whose beliefs are born of disappointment. Added effects, like live music from a small ensemble and newsreels projected onto walls, give some depth to the 70-minute show, while the retail space, in Greenwich Village, itself serves as a reminder of economic hardships, then and now. 
 Though ''Can You Hear Their Voices?'' is often more interesting than exciting, the script holds up surprisingly well.

HEADLINE: Playing Soccer, And Talking H.I.V.

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN

 BODY:
MAWEWE, South Africa -- Far from the World Cup, in this poor, rural village where there are no paved roads, no nets on the goals and no shoes for many of the players, Clement Nkala, 17, sat in a chair in his soccer uniform and held out his finger to be pricked for an H.I.V. test.
 In a country where 5.7 million people are infected with the virus that causes AIDS -- the most in the world -- the problem is particularly acute here in the Nkomazi district of Mpumalanga Province, near South Africa's eastern border with Swaziland and Mozambique.
 Medical workers estimate that 65 percent of people between the ages of 18 and 34 in this area, slightly smaller in size than Rhode Island, carry H.I.V. and that 5,000 to 8,000 children under the age of 5 have been orphaned. 
 ''I am thinking of my future,'' Nkala said Saturday afternoon. ''It is important to know your status.''
 Sarah Kate Noftsinger seemed pleased and startled. A player volunteering to be tested in the open, with his friends playing nearby, would not have happened in this remote district 15 months ago, when she started a youth soccer league that has expanded to five villages and 2,500 boys on 160 teams in under-14 and under-17 divisions. 
 In this culture, parents seldom talk to their children about sex, medical workers said. Many are afraid to be tested for H.I.V., fearing that they might get their fingers pricked one day and die the next. Denial can be more comforting than the stress of knowing. Admission carries the risk of being shunned by a family, by an entire community. Nkala was a breakthrough.
 ''This is a big step,'' said Noftsinger, 29, of Richmond, Va., who is director of sports and leadership for Triad Trust, a Boston-based charity that seeks to reduce AIDS-related deaths.
 Subduing H.I.V. in this region of 500,000 people will not happen soon, it is universally agreed. But this is another fledgling attempt, by creating a sports league and educating players, to show that H.I.V. is preventable, that medicine is available for those who are infected and that there can be a big difference between living with H.I.V. and dying from AIDS.
 ''It's a way to address something that nobody wants to talk about through a game that everybody loves,'' Noftsinger said.
 She is a small woman with the ebullient energy of a midfielder, which she was until the Women's United Soccer Association folded in the United States in 2003. 
 She first came to this area to give a two-week clinic in December 2008. Five local advocates, in their mid-20s, pleaded with Noftsinger to help them start a sustainable league that could combine soccer and H.I.V. awareness and might prevent another generation from being lost.
 Too often, said Zola Ndlovu, the league's executive liaison, well-meaning Americans put on clinics then leave without training the locals to carry on in their absence.
 ''When they are gone, we are still dying,'' Ndlovu said.
 Flying home from that first trip, Noftsinger scribbled a business plan on a napkin. She felt the empathy of a survivor, having twice recovered from colon cancer and from a broken vertebra, sustained while heading a soccer ball.
 Surgery was required in 2006 to repair the vertebra and a ruptured disk. A year and a half of lethargy followed, she said, as she healed. She quit taking classes at business school and left her job as an assistant coach for Stanford's women's soccer team. The idea of a league in South Africa shifted a stalled Noftsinger back into overdrive. She buzzes about now, carrying three cellphones, writing notes on her hand. Even her name has been compressed from Sarah Kate to Skate.
 ''Fast forward always, in Charlie Chaplin mode,'' said Themba Mahakane, the league's financial director.
 For six weeks at a time, Noftsinger travels here as executive director of the league's umbrella organization, Triad Nkomazi Rush. She believes the league will survive only if it can be maintained by local leaders. Scheduling, finances, marketing and medical education are administered by a local seven-member executive committee. Her approach is to offer advice but not to take control.
 In three years, Noftsinger hopes to make herself obsolete. She envisions the league continuing with full-time jobs for local administrators, coaches and medical workers in an area with an unemployment rate estimated at 60 to 90 percent.
 Once a week, players receive instruction about topics like H.I.V., domestic violence and self-confidence. Instruction is provided by medical workers and by an improvisational drama troupe that uses plays, songs, dance and poetry to address social situations encountered in daily life.
 Teams with perfect attendance receive uniforms provided by Rush, an American youth soccer organization. To keep the uniforms, players must continue attending the classes. A few girls from a nearby village called Block B have begun taking health lessons and have asked to join a team.
 The ultimate goal is to have each player tested for H.I.V. every 90 days, using a fingerprint-based system that keeps the results confidential.
 ''Triad Nkomazi Rush is trying to make people see that a person with H.I.V. is not the enemy,'' said Paul Makofane, the deputy director for sports advancement in Mpumalanga Province. ''And they are transferring skills, so we won't have to rely on the mother programs from the United States. We can run our own.''
 Almost everyone in this area has a relative or friend infected with the virus. The mother, father and brother of Nomsa Shabangu, the league's director of medical education, have all tested positive, she said. Among migrant farm workers, who frequently change sexual partners, she said, the infection rate may be 80 or 90 percent.
 Ignorance about sex and disease is rampant. From village to village, myths persist that men can be cured of H.I.V. by having sex with an infant less than 2 years old, or with a virgin, or even with a goat or a dog, Shabangu said. She had her own misunderstandings, giving birth at 16.
 ''I was not aware that I could get pregnant and have a baby from sexual activity,'' Shabangu, 26, said. ''Our parents taught us that you go and buy a baby from the hospital or they fall from airplanes. It's important that we start telling the truth about these things.''
 Some H.I.V. transmission results from desperate poverty in Nkomazi villages, where the most thriving business can be the local mortuary, Noftsinger said.
 A woman might trade sexual favors to buy a few extra minutes for her cellphone, so she can keep in contact with her relatives, or for help paying the grocery bill so she can feed an extended family decimated by AIDS.
 ''What do you do when you have to put food on the table for your brothers and sisters because your parents have died?'' Noftsinger said.
 The nascent league has faced inevitable advances and retreats. On Sunday, in the nearby village of Kamhlushwa, a championship tournament was completed before a monthlong break for winter and the World Cup. Trophies and medals were awarded. But the under-14 title game was suspended for more than an hour as opposing coaches tried to resolve a dispute over a red-card ejection.
 By the time the match concluded, the sun had set. Noftsinger piled one of the teams in her pickup so the children would not have to walk more than a mile home in the dark. 
 ''I think I got five more gray hairs today,'' she said.
 Some days are more heartening, like Saturday, when 14 players in Mawewe agreed to be tested for H.I.V. Nkala stuck out his finger and a drop of blood was placed in a cartridge that resembled a home pregnancy kit.
 A few minutes later, the test came back negative. Nkala said he wanted to become sexually active. Through the soccer league, he said, ''I know how to protect myself.''
 It was important that the players took the test voluntarily instead of being pushed, said Clifford Ndlovu, the league's marketing director.
 ''It shows they trust us,'' he said.

HEADLINE: First the Spill, Then the Lawsuits

BYLINE: By JOHN SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
''Oil spill damages? You May Be Entitled to Compensation,'' reads a billboard in LaFourche Parish, Louisiana. 
 It is just one of the tactics lawyers are using to sign up clients to sue BP, along with running advertisements on Gulf Coast television stations, buying Internet addresses like GulfOilSpillLawFirm.com, and holding informational seminars -- with free food and drinks -- for those who feel the oil company owes them something. 
 Lawyers across the nation have filed nearly 200 lawsuits so far related to the April 20 oil disaster, including death and injury claims for those aboard the rig, claims of damage and economic loss for people whose livelihoods are threatened by the slick, and shareholder suits over BP's plunging stock. Cases have even been filed on behalf of the oil-coated fish and birds. Lawyers also plan to file a civil racketeering action alleging a corporate conspiracy with the Bush administration.
 At a seminar on Tuesday evening at the Emerald Grande hotel in Destin, Fla., 150 residents and business owners heard a presentation by two lawyers, Robert J. McKee of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and Stuart H. Smith of New Orleans, about dealing with the BP claims process. 
 Mr. Smith, who had flown his private plane from his home in New Orleans for the event, called the continuing gusher under the gulf ''a disaster on the installment plan.''
 They introduced a team of experts they have assembled to fight BP in court, including accountants, an oceanographer, chemist and toxicologist, and explained to the audience how to gather records to improve their chances.
 Mr. McKee's advice to the group -- and it was just advice, because he had to stay on the proper side of the ethical line that bars solicitation of clients -- was blunt. Should they decide to sue, he said, ''You find someone competent who can kick their butt and take what is owed to you for full, fair and honest compensation.'' 
 Because thousands of plaintiffs' lawyers from across the country are trying to join in the kicking, consolidation of the federal suits is almost certain. The decision will be made, oddly enough, some 2,000 miles away from the Gulf Coast, by a panel of judges meeting on July 29 in Boise, Idaho, to manage what is known as multidistrict litigation. 
 The panels will almost certainly give the oil cases to a single judge or a small number of judges, who will then sort them into groups and combine tasks, like the discovery process to ferret out underlying facts for all the cases.
 Finding a judge without a potential conflict of interest in the sprawling case could be a challenge: half of the active judges in the federal judicial district in which New Orleans sits have already recused themselves. 
 The judges in Idaho may send the cases to New Orleans (where more of the plaintiffs and the damage can be found), to Houston (as the defendants wish, perhaps because of the city's ties to the oil industry) or to more neutral ground. Wherever it ends up, Louisiana's feisty lawyers are likely to play a big role in the litigation.
 Seasoned Texas litigators like Brent W. Coon, who fought BP over the 2005 plant explosion in Texas City, are likely to be deeply involved, as will experts in mass tort litigation from around the country who have taken part in enormously complex suits involving tobacco, pharmaceuticals, accelerating Toyotas and defective Chinese drywall. 
 The plaintiffs' lawyers are eager to fight the oil giant, just as soon as they get past fighting one another. 
 They are still involved in the scrum at the beginning of most multidistrict litigation, trying to get the largest number of clients and earliest filings in hopes of winning influence in steering the consolidated litigation. 
 Mass tort litigators and the specialists do not think highly of each other. Mr. Smith, an environmental litigator in New Orleans who has sued oil companies for much of his career, scoffs at the generalist approach to mass tort lawyering. ''If you need brain surgery, you don't go to an orthopedic surgeon,'' he said. 
 The mass tort litigators do not pretend to be experts in every field of law required in every case. Asked whether he had experience in the arcane maritime law involved in the spill, Stephen A. Sheller, a mass tort specialist from Philadelphia, said, ''I go on a cruise boat occasionally.'' 
 But the mass tort lawyers argue that their experience in prior multidistrict cases is essential to building the ad hoc law firm that will take on the large defense firms that the corporations retain. 
 ''That's the David-and-Goliath dynamic,'' said Richard J. Arsenault, a lawyer in Alexandria, La., who represents plaintiffs in many BP cases.
 The question that is likely to dominate much of the litigation, wherever it lands, is the extent of liability for BP and the companies it worked with. 
 The most straightforward cases are those involving direct impact -- compensation to the families of the dead and wounded on the rig, and the effect of the spill on people like commercial boat operators, fishermen and others whose livelihood could be destroyed, and landowners whose property is fouled. 
 Beyond those cases, there are shades of gray, including for businesses that have not been touched by oil, but still feel its impact. 
 The Oil Pollution Act, which governs many of the damage issues, does not spell out how far such liability extends, said Val P. Exnicios, a New Orleans lawyer. 
 The commercial fishing boat is an easy call, Mr. Exnicios said, but what about the stand next to the dock that sells snowballs, the shaved-ice treat that the fishermen might buy after a hot day on the water? What about the company that sells the ice to the snowball stand? 
 ''This case will ultimately determine where the courts are going to draw the line,'' he said. 
 Stephen J. Herman, who is serving as a liaison between plaintiffs' lawyers and a New Orleans judge who has many of the cases, said he expected BP to fight continuing claims of indirect damage though they might pay initially. 
 ''In the short term they might, for PR purposes,'' he said. ''But in the long run they won't, because it would bankrupt them.''
 The lawyers are plotting a range of strategies.
 Mr. Smith hopes to circumvent some of the restrictions on the claims process under the Oil Pollution Act for some clients by arguing that the act does not come into play at all. His point: the pollution is not coming from a vessel or rig, as the law requires. The rig, he notes, is long gone, and what is left is a hole in the ground spewing oil. 
 The pollution should fall under the nuisance claims in Louisiana civil law and other states' common law, just as a neighbor's toxic dump or feedlot might. That might provide recovery, he said, for people whose land will never get oil on it, but who will claim the smell interferes with the quiet enjoyment of their property. 
 Mike Papantonio, a Florida lawyer, has many cases involving fishermen and shrimpers, but he is also filing civil racketeering claims intending to tie the BP blowout to what he sees as close collaboration between the industry and Bush administration officials. 
 ''It's a case that helps us reflect on where we are after eight years,'' Mr. Papantonio said. The relaxation of regulatory oversight ''disconnected the hydraulic line from your brakes,'' he said.
 The lawyers, meanwhile, know that they are often viewed as predators who sue for their own profit. A person commented on the Web site of The Times-Picayune of New Orleans about an article on the lawyers' conference saying, ''The vultures are circling, hopefully some of them will get soaked in the oil.'' 
 Lisa A. Rickard, the president of the U.S. Chamber Institute for Legal Reform, said compensation efforts should reward victims, but litigation drags on for decades and ''the end result has too often left at least some victims at the back of the line.''
 Such talk riles the plaintiffs' lawyers. 
 ''Why do I need more money?'' asked Daniel E. Becnel Jr., who has worked on mass tort cases leading to billions of dollars in settlements from tobacco companies, breast implant makers and others. 
 Mr. Becnel raised his shirt to show a long scar on his left side, the mark of difficult surgery to give a kidney to his brother, which left him with lasting health problems. He has also survived grueling treatment for leukemia. 
 ''I'm living on borrowed time,'' he said. ''I should have been dead 10 years ago.''
 With these cases, he insisted, ''I want to do right.''
 Calvin Fayard Jr., a New Orleans lawyer, said the damage to the gulf and the way of life there was ''heartbreaking and gut-wrenching for me, being born and raised in Louisiana.''

HEADLINE: Mexico's Coach Feeds Passion Of a Nation

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN

 BODY:
JOHANNESBURG -- Of all the opponents that South Africa could have faced Friday in the first World Cup match on African soil, none will probably be better prepared for the noise and emotion and altitude than Mexico.
 The vast Soccer City stadium will throb like a giant beehive with tens of thousands of vuvuzelas bleating in unison. But Mexico is not likely to be intimidated. El Tricolores are regularly serenaded by buzzing trumpets in their own hornets' nest -- 105,000-seat Estadio Azteca in Mexico City -- where at 7,200 feet the air is even thinner than it is in South Africa.
 And no team has played a more exhaustive pre-World Cup schedule. Mexico has seemingly been on tour longer than the Black Eyed Peas, playing a series of matches in the United States, jetting off to play England in London and Italy in Brussels, collecting passport stamps the way some teams collect yellow cards. They need roadies as much as a manager. 
 All of this preparation was for one purpose -- to secure Mexico's advancement beyond the second round of the 32-team tournament, where it has exited from four consecutive World Cups. El Tri did reach the quarterfinals twice, in 1970 and 1986, but both times as host. Its progression was not so much applauded as expected and demanded.
 This time, far from home, playing in the same group as South Africa, France and Uruguay, a perch in the quarterfinals would afford grander validation. It is more than an objective, Mexico's Coach Javier Aguirre has said. It is an obsession. But the ultimate aim is to climb to the semifinals, a height that Mexico has never reached.
 ''I see hunger,'' Aguirre said of his players at a news conference Thursday. ''They want to write a chapter in history.''
 He is a man who inspires confidence in the calm, firm way he speaks and in the way he looks -- handsome, with a gray pompadour and a chiseled face that belongs on a coin.
 Such assurance was desperately needed in April 2009, when Aguirre was hired for his second stint as coach of Mexico's national team. Qualification for the 2010 World Cup was floundering. Coaches seemed to pop up with the randomness of lottery balls.
 Hugo Sanchez, the Mexican legend, could not reproduce tactically on the sideline what he had done on the field. Jesus Ramirez lasted four games. Sven-Goran Eriksson, a Swede who coached England at the 2006 World Cup, failed to navigate the deep channels of Mexican soccer politics or the jostling rapids that confront visitors in the North American, Central American and Caribbean region.
 When Aguirre was fired by Atletico Madrid, in the Spanish league, the Mexican federation eagerly rehired him. He had coached Mexico to the second round of the 2002 World Cup. Now an entire country looked to his self-confidence to restore pride in the national sport.
 He found players who were ''demotivated, losing their energy,'' Aguirre said. ''There was a lot of quarreling going on, a lack of order in the ranks.''
 As the spring and summer of 2009 played out, Mexico faced a dire economy during a global recession, a swine flu epidemic, and escalating and brutal drug wars. In that toxic environment, Justino Campean, president of the Mexican federation, said at the time, ''Not to qualify for the World Cup would really be devastating.''
 Aguirre gathered his players and told them that a call-up to the national team was a reward, not a punishment. The team would come before individual vanity.
 Last July at the Gold Cup, after being suspended for kicking a player from Panama, Aguirre returned to see his team defeat a reserve squad from the United States, 5-0, in the final. It was Mexico's first victory in a decade on the road against the Americans.
 Then in mid-August, Mexico prevailed again, 2-1, over the United States at Estadio Azteca, this time in a World Cup qualifying match. Its ticket to South Africa was all but punched.
 ''Today is a day to celebrate, drink a few tequilas and then get back to work,'' Aguirre said.
 Playing a possession game that can be both patient and aggressive, he has blended the youth and experience of what he calls Mexico's ''greatest football generation.''
 The speed and creativity of forwards Giovani dos Santos and Carlos Vela are complemented by the ageless probing vision of Cuauhtemoc Blanco, whose passes are still of exquisite weight even if his stocky frame is not.
 Andres Guardado, with his leonine hair, provides a threatening presence on the left wing. Javier Hernandez, the forward known as Little Pea, nearly quit soccer a year ago to pursue a degree in business administration, upset with modest playing time at Chivas Guadalajara in the Mexican league. But his career has since been revived by such scoring proficiency that he will join Manchester United after this tournament.
 ''They are the most daring team in the World Cup,'' said Carlos Alberto Parreira, South Africa's coach.
 Thursday, Aguirre seemed remarkably relaxed. His team is at a peak after 60 days in training, he said, adding, ''We are here to play football, not to make friends and do some sightseeing.''
 He would love to shake hands with Nelson Mandela, who is scheduled to make a brief appearance before kickoff. Aguirre said he had read many articles and books about the patriarch of South Africa's so-called Rainbow Nation, calling him ''a living icon, a beacon.''
 The opening match is viewed here as something more than a sporting event. Hopeful citizens want it to be a unifying moment for a country divided until 16 years ago by apartheid. Aguirre is sympathetic, but his own purpose is more ruthless. He is here to win a soccer match.
 ''For 90 minutes, I will be against South Africa,'' Aguirre said. 
 Friday's opening match, he was sure, would be ''a great day for Mexico.''

HEADLINE: Google Is No Help To These Modern Spies

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY

 BODY:
''Rubicon'' seems irresistible: a suspenseful series laced with conspiracy and espionage in the style of classic 1970s thrillers like ''Three Days of the Condor'' and ''The Parallax View.'' 
 The official two-hour premiere of ''Rubicon'' doesn't arrive until August, but on Sunday, after the season finale of ''Breaking Bad,'' AMC will offer a sneak preview of the one-hour pilot. The next day the network will offer the pilot on Hulu, iTunes and video on demand, using newfangled forms of media to promote a show that is an artful throwback to an antiquated era before Google, Facebook and iPads. 
 And the pilot, filmed in faded shades of sepia and gray, is certainly moody and intriguingly enigmatic. James Badge Dale (''The Pacific'') plays Will Travers, a brilliant, solitary young intelligence analyst who stumbles on troubling clues (some are buried in crossword puzzles) at his day job at the American Policy Institute, a government intelligence agency masquerading as a New York City research center. 
 Will begins to suspect that there is more to his agency than he thought, and that a high-level conspiracy could be manipulating world events. It's a somewhat retro anti-establishment theme, the kind that flourished back in the days when the C.I.A. was less fettered, more opaque and widely feared. It also reflects the sort of paranoia that may have fresh resonance in today's culture of Bush-era torture charges, anti-government talk-radio rants and Tea Party activism. 
 There are unexplained deaths, weird coded signals and strange behavior, but perhaps the most puzzling thing in the pilot is the ahistorical ambience. The narrative takes place in the present -- or at least after the Sept. 11 attacks -- but the sets make it look like a period piece, especially in contrast to the absurdly high-tech gadgetry of ''24.'' Much in the way that ''Mad Men'' celebrates 1960s Madison Avenue fashion and mores, ''Rubicon'' looks like a homage to high-class, low-tech 1970s think tanks. 
 The institute is a slightly clubbier version of the covert intelligence office where Robert Redford's character worked -- and narrowly missed being killed -- in ''Three Days of the Condor.'' Will's office is lined with leather-bound books, atlases, encyclopedia sets and file cabinets. There is barely a glimpse of a computer screen; he sits at his desk, reads paper reports and writes longhand on a legal pad. When he and his colleagues are given new assignments in the conference room -- decorated with framed maps and a blackboard -- the boss tosses thick bound files on the polished wooden table. 
 Will is asked by another analyst for help, and the problem is set out on hand-printed index cards pinned to a cork board. The colleague can't see a connection among four cities -- Ajaccio, Seville, Dubrovnik, Larnaca. Will can think of several right off the bat. (They are all part of the Roman Empire, they are all in countries that spend less than 5 percent of their G.D.P. on the military.) But nothing seems quite right. All of the analysts are deep thinkers, but none of them seem reliant on the Internet to prop up their thoughts.
 The office tolerates a form of workplace sexism that these days seems vintage. Nobody flinches when one of Will's more annoying colleagues, Grant Test (Christopher Evan Welch), scolds a new, low-level female analyst for not bringing breakfast. 
 ''Getting the doughnuts is the most important part of your job,'' he hisses. She looks chagrined. 
 The pilot posits high-level conspiracy but it doesn't illuminate the connections, if any, among some of the lead characters. Miranda Richardson plays Katherine Rhumor, a woman who lives in a grand estate with an important, if imperiled, husband. Mostly, the narrative follows Will's journey into confusion and intrigue. 
 It's easy to fall under the spell of the murky, paranoid world of ''Rubicon.'' It's harder to tell from this preview whether the atmospherics add up to a solid and complex mystery. The pilot isn't groundbreaking, but it is promising enough to justify waiting for the full two-hour premiere on Aug. 1.

HEADLINE: Enthusiasm for Economy Sends Markets Surging

BYLINE: By SUSANNA G. KIM; David Jolly contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The stock market roared back to life on Thursday, driving the Dow Jones industrial average firmly above 10,000, as investors latched on to hopes that maybe, just maybe, the economic scene was not quite as bleak as it seemed.
 After weeks of violent swings, driven largely by concerns over the unfolding financial crisis in Europe, bargain-hunters swooped in. The broad stock market leapt almost 3 percent in its biggest one-day gain in two weeks. 
 For a day, at least, fears that the nation's fragile economic recovery might falter were cast aside. A stream of upbeat economic reports overseas prompted some investors to reverse their bearish bets with a rush of buy orders.
 But few investors or analysts seemed convinced that the market, down roughly 11 percent from its April highs, was finally out of the woods. Indeed, some suggested the gains might prove fleeting, given the nervousness pervading the markets.
 ''Investors are spooked very easily by the smallest negative news stories now, and it won't take a lot for the Dow to be trading back to 10,000 as early as tomorrow,'' said M. Jake Dollarhide, the chief executive of Longbow Asset Management.
 Even before the opening bell sounded, it looked like a good day for Wall Street. Thursday's rally began early, in Asian markets, and then spilled over into European trading. The United States market gathered momentum into the close of New York trading, as some traders reversed short positions, or bets that stocks would decline in value.
 By the close, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 273.28 points, or 2.76 percent, at 10,172.53. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 2.95 percent, or 31.15 points, to 1,086.84, while the Nasdaq was up 2.77 percent, or 59.86 points, to 2,218.71.
 The rally was broad and swift. Energy shares led the charge. BP, which has lost nearly half its value since the disastrous oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, jumped 10 percent. Only a day before, BP had plunged nearly 16 percent after lawmakers called on the company to suspend its dividends and its advertising to pay for the costs of the cleanup.
 Driving the gains were several economic reports, mostly from overseas, that seemed to point to a sustainable global recovery. The European Central Bank slightly raised its forecast for economic growth in the euro zone this year, while the Japanese government reported that its economy grew 1.2 percent in the first quarter.
 A stronger-than-expected employment report in Australia and news that New Zealand was confident enough in its economic prospects to raise interest rates added to the sense of optimism, as did better-than-expected results on weekly jobless claims in the United States.
 Good news also came from China, in the form of surprisingly strong export figures. To some, the data -- a trade surplus of $19.5 billion in May -- suggested that China's economy remained robust, despite troubles elsewhere in the world.
 ''China has been the economic juggernaut, and at least it's not falling apart,'' said Michael Fitzpatrick, vice president for energy at MF Global.
 Others, however, insisted that the Chinese economy would ultimately slow down, posing a risk to growth worldwide.
 ''Whether it's going to be a soft landing or hard landing -- that to me is the most fundamental risk,'' said Stephen P. Wood, market strategist for Russell Investors. ''That's really the big wild card.''
 Mr. Wood said a slowdown in China was ''inevitable.''
 Indeed, many on Wall Street say they believe the economic outlook remains murky at best.
 A report showing that weekly unemployment benefit rolls in the United States fell by 255,000 to a seasonally adjusted 4.5 million, the lowest total since December 2008, provided some relief to downbeat news of late. But the report was not enough to persuade economists that unemployment would decline markedly soon.
 Scott J. Brown, chief economist of Raymond James, said the jobs numbers from Thursday and last Friday indicated a ''long hard slog'' ahead.
 ''The recovery should continue, but it may not be strong enough to push the unemployment rate down very much,'' Mr. Brown said.
 Mr. Wood said American economic data like Thursday's claims numbers were ''not bad, but not great.''
 ''Jobless rate leads to consumer confidence, which leads to consumer spending,'' Mr. Wood said. ''The key is consumption. The employment situation is the basis for consumer sentiment and behavior. And we're seeing stabilization and a modest improvement in that.''
 Mr. Wood acknowledged that risks from the oil spill and the European debt crisis could still affect the United States' growth, which the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, indicated would be 3.5 percent this year as long as the markets held.
 Mr. Fitzpatrick said the news from China was more significant than the increase in jobless claims. ''But to say they're going to carry the entire world out of a recession is out of the question if their customers around the world are mired in a recession,'' Mr. Fitzpatrick said.
 In Europe, the Euro Stoxx 50 index, a barometer of euro zone blue chips, settled 2 percent higher, while the FTSE 100 index added 0.92 percent in London.

HEADLINE: Initial Jobless Claims Fall Again, but Exports Slow

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- A picture of a steady but still sluggish economic recovery emerged from reports Thursday that showed fewer people were claiming unemployment aid while United States exports were slowing.
 The reports echo a suggestion this week from the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, that the rebound will remain intact despite high unemployment, a fragile housing market and Europe's debt crisis. But it will take time to create enough jobs to bring down the 9.7 percent unemployment rate.
 Initial unemployment claims fell by 3,000, to a seasonally adjusted 456,000, the Labor Department said Thursday. It was the third consecutive decline, but claims have not moved below where they stood in January. 
 At the same time, the tally of laid-off workers continuing to claim jobless benefits fell by 255,000, the biggest decline in almost a year, to 4.5 million. It could be because more people are finding work. But it may simply mean that they have exhausted their initial state benefits. A Labor Department analyst said state agencies didn't provide any explanation for the drop.
 A weakening in United States sales overseas could hurt the job market. The Commerce Department said the trade deficit rose to the highest level in 16 months as exports fell for the second time in three months. Exports have been a source of strength for United States manufacturers.
 The trade deficit widened to $40.3 billion in April, up 0.75 percent from March. Exports dropped 0.7 percent while imports declined by 0.4 percent.
 For April, exports slipped to $148.8 billion; demand for farm products fell by $647 million and weakness spread across a number of manufactured goods, from electric generators to industrial machinery and aircraft engines. Imports edged down to $189.1 billion. Demand for oil was basically unchanged from March, while total consumer goods imports dipped by $741 million, with the biggest decline coming in pharmaceutical products.
 First-time jobless claims have hovered near 450,000 since the beginning of the year after falling steadily in the second half of 2009. That has raised concerns among economists that hiring remains weak and could slow the recovery.
 Claims peaked at 651,000 in March 2009. Most economists will feel more optimistic that the economy is creating jobs once they fall below 425,000.
 ''The downward trend in layoffs which began in the spring of last year is clearly over, at least for now,'' said Ian C. Shepherdson, chief United States economist for High Frequency Economics. ''With claims stranded at this level, big private sector payroll gains are just not on the agenda.''
 Last week, the Labor Department said the economy generated only 41,000 private-sector jobs in May, down from 218,000 in April. Temporary census hiring added another 411,000 jobs.
 Economists also closely watch the total number of people claiming benefits. They monitor those who are initially receiving 26 weeks of state benefits, on average. But they are also concerned about the number of people who have transitioned to extended federal benefits, which can last up to 73 additional weeks.
 Nearly 5.4 million Americans are receiving extended benefits. All told, about 9.8 million people drew unemployment in the week ended May 22, the latest data available.
 That total is likely to drop in the coming weeks. The extended benefit program expired in early June, and Congress is debating whether to continue it through the end of November.
 About 325,000 people will lose unemployment aid by the end of this week due to the cutoff, the department estimates. That total could grow to 1.25 million by the end of the month if the extension is not passed.

HEADLINE: Population Shows a Racial Shift

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
Two large suburban counties flipped from having white majorities to having white minorities last year. Gwinnett County, outside Atlanta, and Contra Costa County, near San Francisco, showed the change as minorities edged closer to becoming a majority of the nation's youngest children. More than 500 of the nation's more than 3,000 now fall in that category. The census estimates released Thursday also quantified the impact of the recession on former population magnets. California recorded the largest net loss of population to other states, 98,000, followed by New York and Michigan. As of July 1, 2009, racial and ethnic groups other than non-Hispanic whites accounted for 48.6 percent of all births and 48.3 percent of children younger than 5.

HEADLINE: Spring Real Estate Sales Start Strong, Then Taper Off

BYLINE: By VIVIAN S. TOY

 BODY:
This year, the burst of real estate action that marks the spring season came early in New York. Manhattan saw a big sales spike in March, well before the market's usual busy season in May and June. But now, instead of going into the expected overdrive, some brokers say, sales have started to stall. 
 That could simply mean that spring arrived and ended early, as buyers gained confidence in the market and began to shop. Or it could mark the beginning of a slide that will lead to another dip in prices and sales activity. 
 Although many brokers will tell clients that the market has already hit bottom, some economists and real estate experts predict that prices are still falling, and will drop 5 percent to 15 percent by the end of next year.
 ''There was a bit of a frenzy in March into April, and things have leveled off in May,'' said Jonathan J. Miller, president of the appraisal firm Miller Samueland a partner in Condominium Recovery, which invests in real estate. ''The market is still high, but the edge has come off and the level of activity isn't growing anymore.'' 
 He and real estate economists predicted that sales activity would most likely fall back into more seasonal patterns, with fewer transactions going into the summer.
 The number of signed contracts for apartments in Manhattan jumped nearly 35 percent from February to March, to a total of 1,000 contracts, far more than had been typical in the previous two years, according to data provided by Streeteasy.com. In April there was an increase, to 1,063 contracts, but the number slipped slightly in May, to 1,016.
 ''There is a sense that the bottom is near for the housing market, which is why there has been increased activity,'' said Celia Chen, a senior director at Moody's Analytics specializing in housing economics. ''The biggest decline is over,'' she said. ''But we're still expecting prices to decline by another 5 percent.'' 
 The overall economy will determine to some extent whether the increase seen in the spring can be sustained. ''A lot of what happens in June is going to depend on employment trends,'' said Sam Chandan, the chief economist at Real Capital Analytics, a Manhattan company that studies worldwide real estate trends. ''There's a fair amount to give consumers pause.'' He noted that while the national unemployment rate fell slightly in May, the financial industry in New York City continued to lose jobs. 
 Mortgage rates are likely to remain low, Ms. Chen said, but foreclosures nationally are expected to increase in coming months. Manhattan's foreclosure rate has remained very low, thanks to rigorous co-op approval standards, but ''there still will be softness in prices, because there seems to be a pretty large overhang of new construction still out there,'' she said. 
 Mr. Miller estimates that there are as many as 6,500 new condominiums in the so-called shadow inventory: units not yet completed, or built but not yet on the market. ''I don't see how prices can start to rise again until we've dealt with that inventory,'' he said, adding that prices in the region might slide by as much as 15 percent more.
 Dorothy Herman, the chief executive of Prudential Douglas Elliman, said that the number of signed contracts at her agency continued to grow through May. ''There's definitely more consumer confidence and a feeling that the market has stabilized,'' she said. ''I don't think people think it's all over, though. People are leery, because it's a different world now.'' 
 Housing sales activity rose across the country in March and April, in anticipation of the April 30 deadline for the $8,000 first-time buyers' tax credit. But economists and brokers say the tax credit was probably a less powerful incentive in Manhattan, where the average sales price for an apartment is $1.4 million.
 Diane M. Ramirez, the president of Halstead Property, said that because so many people put off buying last year for fear that prices would keep falling, there was a great deal of pent-up demand -- finally released only late last year and earlier this year. 
 It was the same thing three years ago, when consumers were frantic to buy apartments, Ms. Ramirez said, ''because they wanted to beat everybody out of the gate.'' This year, she said, in a very different market, people are buying because they are worried about the potential for rising interest rates and prices. 
 Seeing another sign that the market is on the mend, Pamela Liebman, the president of the Corcoran Group, said that the average price on signed contracts at Corcoran had climbed to $1.5 million in May, from $1.31 million in February.
 ''Some brokers are telling me that things have slowed down and some buyers have put the brakes on because of stock-market volatility,'' she said. ''But I think it's a small percentage.''

HEADLINE: Lessons From Marja For Battles Yet to Come

BYLINE: By C. J. CHIVERS

 BODY:
MARJA, Afghanistan -- Each day, American foot patrols move through farmers' fields and irrigated villages. And each day some are ambushed or encounter hidden bombs. The patrols turn into gunfights in withering heat, or efforts to dismantle the bombs or treat the wounded. Casualties accumulate with the passing weeks, for Americans and Afghans alike. 
 A few months ago, Marja was the focus of a highly publicized assault to push the Taliban from a stronghold and bring Afghanistan's densest area of opium production under government control. The fighting remains raw. 
 What does it mean?
 Is the violence a predictable summer fight for an area the Taliban and those who profit from the drug economy do not want to lose; in other words, an unsurprising flare-up that can be turned around? Or will Marja remain bloody for a long time, allowing insurgents to inflict sustained losses on American units and win merely by keeping the fight alive?
 As NATO and Afghan forces flow into neighboring Kandahar Province, where for the next many months the latest high-profile effort to undo the Taliban's hold will unroll, the continuing fighting in Marja can be read as a sign of problems in the American-led surge. It can also be read as something less worrisome: a difficult period in a campaign always expected to be hard. 
 A prevailing assessment among officers on the ground is this: The outcome is too soon to call. 
 ''Right now it's gray,'' said Maj. Lawrence Lohman, the operations officer for Third Battalion, Sixth Marines, which operates outposts in northern Marja.
 Those who deem the Marja offensive a disappointment, or even a failure, point to the daily violence and to the signs that Afghans have been leaving the area, at least temporarily, to avoid the fighting. They also point to Taliban intimidation of residents, a still limited government presence, and the continued reliance of Afghan police officers and soldiers on American supervision and logistics. These, they say, are ill-boding signs.
 But the signals are contradictory. 
 Most of Marja's civilians returned after moving away ahead of the initial assault. Most of them remain. Compounds that were empty in February are inhabited. Roads once quiet are busy. Fields are thick with crops. Shops in some bazaars have reopened. Afghan units participate visibly in dangerous missions. 
 Lt. Col. Brian Christmas, the battalion's commander, noted that some of Marja's residents had begun providing information on the Taliban, including sharing the names and locations of fighters. Many civilians have been seeking aid and a few have sought contracts for small scale development projects, the early steps in engagement.
 ''I've seen good growth and good progress,'' the colonel said. He added: ''There is still a lot to be done.''
 The Marines point to what they clearly hope is a Helmand pattern, apparent in other districts, including Nawa, where the Taliban were strong and fighting was initially intense. The pattern, they said, is this: With time and resources, the insurgents' position erodes, villages become secure, and engagement and the Afghan government presence expand. 
 Pursuing this goal, Marine companies have been sending out constant small patrols. Their presence keeps the Taliban occupied and inflicts losses, the Marines say, and creates the space to allow for development or programs to gain traction. In the short term, it is also a recipe for small-unit violence -- fierce and frequent.
 ''It goes back to the very basics of what we do: gain and maintain contact,'' said Col. Randall P. Newman, who commands Marine ground forces in central Helmand Province. 
 Colonel Newman said he expected skirmishes to decline in frequency in the months ahead. ''I don't think the guys who are shooting now are committed enough to keep doing this a long time,'' he said.
 More Western troops have died in Helmand Province than in any other, and the sight of medevac helicopters over Marja each day is a reminder that the area has become a center of the province's bloodshed. 
 But Helmand is not uniformly violent. There are areas where fighting is regular -- Marja, Sangin, Nahr-e-Saraj -- and areas where the Taliban had fought hard before being marginalized as a combat force.
 Moreover, the rising casualties have complicated causes. Some are related to the combined effects of Taliban resistance and the Marines' grinding patrol tempo. Others can reasonably be attributed to a shift made last year to rules of engagement that guide American forces. 
 The shift de-emphasized airstrikes, artillery and mortars. This transferred some of the risk in skirmishes from Afghan civilians to Western combatants. In the past, American patrols in contact often quickly called for and received fire support. Not anymore. Many firefights these days are strictly rifle and machine gun fights. 
 Understanding the shift is important. It has made engagement times noticeably longer, driving up the troops' risks and amplifying a perception that Marja, fought with less fire support than what was available to American units in other hotly contested areas, is mired in blood. 
 That perception has obscured a wider view. Maj. Gen. Nick Carter, the British officer commanding NATO forces in Afghanistan's south, urged patience. ''The challenge with this campaign is that it takes time, because it's in the minds of people, and its people take time to be convinced,'' he said.
 He also cautioned against drawing conclusions by extrapolating from Marja alone. The operation, he said, opened provincial roads. Six months ago, the provincial governor, Gulab Mangal, could barely travel; now he covers much of the province.
 ''You've got a central Helmand that is linked together, and in economic terms can develop,'' General Carter said. ''So I think people tend to make the mistake of just thinking about Marja.'' 
 Meanwhile, Marines are wounded by bombs or shot each week. The violence in itself does not mean that the campaign is lost. Fighting is normal to war, a concept sometimes played down in discussions about the United States' counterinsurgency doctrine, which emphasizes developing relationships with the population and helping government agencies gain credibility and provide services. 
 Those directly involved caution that a few months of fighting is not necessarily a basis for grim forecasts, especially during the first summer in a former Taliban enclave. American commanders have been voicing frustration nonetheless, as was evident last month in Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal's description of Marja as ''a bleeding ulcer.'' 
 The remark underscores perhaps the clearest conclusion that can be drawn thus far. Even before the last troops of the Obama administration's surge arrive in Afghanistan, high-level American commanders appear pressed for time, no matter the complexities faced by troops on the ground.

HEADLINE: How Failure Became an Option

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN

 BODY:
Needing a break from the omnipresent BP oil cam, I went back and watched the spirit-resuscitating ''Apollo 13.''Oh, to revel in the days when we could fix anything with duct tape and American self-confidence! Sad to say, it looks like a time capsule.
 This is the film about the crippled lunar flight of 1970 that gave us two of the most iconic lines of our culture: ''Houston, we have a problem'' and ''failure is not an option.'' Turns out, the first line is a slight variation of the actual spoken words, and the second sentence was not part of the historical transcript. But it is part of our self-image. 
In the real flight, as in the movie, our boys jury-rigged a lifeline to their lunar module, and then used what little power they had on a precision-shot to get their tiny craft back home.
 Watching BP's hapless attempts to contain the nation's worst oil spill - from blind reliance on a faulty blowout preventer to deployment of a useless 280,000-pound container dome to the bizarre top kill of golf balls and mud - I wondered what happened to American ingenuity. Yes, I know, they're Brits. But it's our spill, in our waters, from a well that was cemented by Halliburton, the Texas company that Dick Cheney ran before Big Oil moved into the White House.
 Here, this cancer is killing a vast and diverse marine ecosystem, and the best petroleum engineers of the day seem helpless. As ''Apollo 13'' showed, we don't do helpless. But with this spill, we are helpless - by deliberate design.
 The drilling operation in the Gulf of Mexico was supposed to represent some of the most advanced technology on the planet. It was so advanced that BP and other big oil companies were exempted in 2008 from filing a plan on how they would clean up a major spill. They had no fire department because, well, there would never be a fire, silly.
 The reasoning was, BP was too big, too advanced, to fail. Plus, voluntary regulation, the oil companies claimed, was working fine. If that sounds familiar, it was the same argument heard just before the financial crisis. The derivatives and collateralized debt obligations that Wall Street used to make unprecedented profits and then nearly bring down the economy were too big, too advanced for anyone to understand.
 But, in both cases, the stage was set for catastrophic failure, and, in both cases, you can pinpoint two likely causes.
 First, size. In the search for end-stage oil, companies have had to go deeper and further in ever-riskier gambits to pull this gooey fossil fuel from its ancient slumber. The easy oil era is long over. In the new era, monster rigs such as the Deepwater Horizon go a mile below the surface, and then reach another 20,000 feet below the ocean floor.
 The soul of this new machine is unknowable. To slow it down, as BP should have done when trouble first appeared in the line, is too costly. And because of its size and complexity, there are no easy, manual fixes in the event of a disaster. When its fail-safe device, the blowout preventer, did not work, there was no human fallback - not even a plan, as it turned out. Failure was the only option.
 Second, consider the consequence of a huge oil leak. If the crew of Apollo 13 had failed, they would have lost their lives. BP had only to look at Exxon. After the worst oil spill in American history, Exxon spent nearly two decades trying to game a legal system that should have brought them to within an inch of their corporate life.
 In the end, Exxon prevailed. The Supreme Court of John Roberts, a compliant pet of the corporate world, ruled for Big Oil. The original jury award of $5 billion ended up being around $500 million - a few days' earnings. Exxon flourished beyond its dreams, reporting in 2008 the largest annual profit for an American company in history.
 Similarly, the Wall Street titans who crashed the American economy did not go to jail, or even give up their gilded cocoons. They were rewarded with federal bailouts, and by Christmas of last year, bonuses were back, as if nothing had happened.
 It's not too late to reverse this trend. Congress could pass the Big Oil Bailout Prevention Act, which would raise liability caps in a spill from the laughable level of $75 million to $10 billion. That would sting. There is a real possibility that BP could go bankrupt. That would set off alarms in every boardroom. And somebody on Wall Street might still see the inside of a prison.
 What's needed is the return of a basic law of nature, the one used by those Apollo heroes to get home: gravity.
 This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Senators Losing Patience With U.S. Policy on China

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Leading senators frustrated by a lack of progress by the Obama administration signaled on Thursday that they were willing to consider retaliatory measures to address China's policies on trade, currency and intellectual property. 
 At a Senate Finance Committee hearing, the members suggested that President Obama's strategy of quiet diplomacy was producing limited results. 
 In testimony to the panel, Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner could point to only a few accomplishments from the annual bilateral talks he attended in Beijing last month with Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
 As both economies struggle to recover from the recession, longstanding complaints have gotten louder that China gives unfair support to its export-oriented manufacturers, fails to abide by World Trade Organization agreements, permits the theft of American intellectual property and protects its domestic industries from competition from abroad. 
 Mr. Geithner said ''we want China to provide a level playing field'' and vowed, as he and his predecessors had done before, ''to engage forcefully with China.'' 
 He said China had published a draft measure to change ''some of the troubling aspects'' of a new system China used to accredit products as eligible for government procurement contracts. Mr. Geithner also said China had agreed to ''a high-level process over the coming weeks and months'' to discuss its innovation policies.
 China also agreed to submit by July a revised proposal for joining a W.T.O. agreement on government procurement, and to ease foreign investment in some areas. Mr. Geithner said the administration would ''apply the full arsenal of tools available'' to ensure that China met its trading obligations. 
 But lawmakers did not appear impressed. 
 ''We do not have a strategic, coordinated United States economic policy, that I can determine, with respect to China,'' Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana and the chairman of the committee, told him.
 Mr. Baucus said he was particularly concerned about failure to enforce intellectual property rules. With the goal of promoting ''indigenous innovation,'' China has set product standards and procurement preferences that are a disadvantage to American workers, companies and technology, many economists believe. Mr. Geithner said some progress on those areas had come out of the bilateral talks, known officially as the United States-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue.
 When Mr. Baucus said the United States was oriented toward process, while China was focused on results, Mr. Geithner replied, ''China's not going to become like the United States overnight.'' 
 He added: ''China still has a government that plays an overwhelming role in determining economic activity. As you said, there is still a broad range of practices that China pursues today that is designed to protect China's workers and firms at the expense of China's trading partners.''
 The top Republican on the committee, Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, criticized the administration's decision to delay the release of a foreign exchange report in which the United States could find that China had manipulated its currency, the renminbi, keeping its value artificially low to stimulate exports.
 The Treasury has not made such a finding since 1994, and successive administrations have avoided doing so, preferring instead to try to persuade China to let the renminbi's value fluctuate. 
 ''Is the Chinese government going to make a significant adjustment to its exchange rate, just because our Treasury Department held off on issuing this report?'' Mr. Grassley asked. ''I doubt it.'' 
 He also suggested that the time had come for the United States to consider retaliation in some areas of trade. ''If one of the major beneficiaries of the world trading system engages in a pattern of refusing to play by the same rules as everyone else, then we should reconsider the rules that we apply to that country,'' he said. 
 Mr. Geithner pointed to new suggestions of willingness by China to allow appreciation of the renminbi, as it did from 2005 to 2008. ''China has made it clear in public that they have decided to resume the reform -- that's the phrase they use -- to resume the reform of their exchange-rate policy,'' Mr. Geithner told Mr. Grassley, but added, ''As you know, they clearly have not decided when and how they're going to act.'' 
 Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, asked Mr. Geithner when he would ''stop slow-dancing'' and take stronger action. ''Our constituents are getting angrier and angrier, and that is what, of course, is fueling this protectionist drive in this country,'' he said.
 And Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said that ''if the current state of our China currency negotiations had a theme song,'' it would be Maxine Nightingale's rhythm-and-blues hit, ''Right Back Where We Started From.''
 Mr. Schumer vowed to press ahead with bipartisan legislation that would remove one of the stumbling blocks to a manipulation determination -- a finding of intent. The bill would compel the United States to take action against a country whose currency was in ''misalignment.'' 
 Senator Olympia J. Snowe, a Maine Republican who has been on occasion a crucial swing vote, told Mr. Geithner that he had offered little more than ''soothing words.'' 
 ''The test of these things is not what people say and it's not how many meetings you have,'' Mr. Geithner told her. ''The test is what actually happens to the terms and conditions that U.S. companies compete on.''

HEADLINE: Calls Mount For Inquiry Into Primary In S. Carolina

BYLINE: By KATE PHILLIPS

 BODY:
Calls are mounting for an investigation into Alvin Greene, the candidate who surprised pretty much everyone by winning the South Carolina Democratic primary for the United States Senate on Tuesday. 
 State Democratic officials have urged Mr. Greene to quit the contest against Senator Jim DeMint, a Republican, and top lawmakers, including Representative James E. Clyburn, began suggesting on Thursday that Mr. Greene was a ''plant.'' 
 Mr. Clyburn, the House Democratic majority whip, called for a federal investigation because of reports that Mr. Greene, who told television reporters and others that he is unemployed, somehow paid the more than $10,000 filing fee to run for the Senate.
 ''There were some real shenanigans going on in the South Carolina primary,'' Mr. Clyburn said on a radio show. ''I don't know if he was a Republican plant; he was someone's plant.''
 The Associated Press reported that Mr. Greene had been charged with a felony in a case involving showing pornographic images to a college student. Mr. Greene, 32, was largely silent about that as more and more news media tried to contact him. (In interviews on Thursday, he would not comment on the charge, saying he was innocent until proved guilty.) He said he would not step down.
 Mr. Greene was asked in numerous television interviews on Thursday about the cash he used to pay the filing fee, especially given the fact that he is receiving unemployment benefits and is represented in criminal court by a public defender. He said it was his own money.

HEADLINE: Surprising Immigration Crackdown Advances

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH

 BODY:
BOSTON -- Lawmakers were tangled in budget talks inside the Massachusetts Statehouse this week, but a 19-year-old college student spent even more time at the gold-domed building on Beacon Hill. 
 Andres Del Castillo, who just finished his freshman year at Suffolk University in Boston, is holding a vigil on the Statehouse steps to protest what could be the state's harshest crackdown on illegal immigrants in decades. The plan, already approved by the Senate, must survive budget negotiations with the House to become law.
 And while Arizona's tough new immigration policy seemed largely irrelevant here when it passed in April -- both legislative chambers are controlled by Democrats who typically pay scant attention to the issue, and Bill O'Reilly of Fox News has derided Massachusetts as a ''sanctuary state'' for illegal immigrants -- ripple effects hit almost immediately. 
 Five days after the Arizona measure became law, the Massachusetts House came close to passing a Republican proposal to block public benefits for illegal immigrants. A similar bill failed overwhelmingly just a year earlier. But supporters said the Arizona law -- and pockets of anger here over the case of President Obama's Kenyan aunt, who had been living in public housing in Boston while fighting a deportation order -- turned the tide.
 ''It's all part of the same stew we're in,'' said Representative Denise Provost, a Democrat from Somerville who said her office was inundated with hostile calls after she voted against the crackdown in April. ''It's partly Arizona, partly the economy, partly radio show hosts being obsessed with these issues.''
 By the time the Senate moved to tighten restrictions on illegal immigrants last month, a Suffolk University/7 News poll had bolstered the position of Republican lawmakers like Representative Jeffrey Perry, who is running for Congress on a platform of curbing illegal immigration. The poll of 500 registered Massachusetts voters found that more than half supported the Arizona law.
 The poll, which had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4.4 percentage points, also found that 84 percent want the state to require proof of citizenship before approving benefits like public assistance.
 Mr. Perry said news accounts about Mr. Obama's aunt, and about a person suspected of being an illegal immigrant who rear-ended another state lawmaker last month, helped ignite the issue here. He also pointed to last month's arrest of two Pakistani men here on immigration charges in connection with the attempted bombing in Times Square.
 ''How much more egregious can it be than the president of the United States' relative, who happens to be illegal, getting a housing subsidy?'' Mr. Perry said. ''All these stories go against the contention of folks on the other side of the issue that we don't have a problem.''
 The Senate measure passed 28 to 10, as an amendment to the chamber's budget bill, a day after the poll was released. It would strengthen or expand existing rules that block illegal immigrants from public health care, housing and higher education benefits. 
 The measure would also require the state attorney general to set up a telephone line for people to anonymously report people suspected of being illegal immigrants and businesses that hire them, and to investigate any such reports. And it would require companies doing business with the state to confirm that their workers were here legally.
 ''We never expected to have to be on the lookout for something like this in Massachusetts,'' said Mr. Del Castillo, who has barely left the Statehouse since Sunday and said he would stay until the Senate withdrew its legislation. ''It's creating anti-immigrant sentiment within our communities, our schools and our work environments.''
 Mr. Del Castillo and a small group of others conducting the vigil are especially concerned with a provision that would codify into law an existing policy that bars illegal immigrants from qualifying for resident tuition rates at state colleges. Most of them are students themselves, and their group, the Student Immigrant Movement, has also rallied for federal legislation that would allow illegal immigrants who arrived here before they turned 15 to apply for legal residency.
 Most drivers sped past the group Wednesday as it huddled on the rain-slicked Statehouse steps. A few honked in support, and one leaned out the window of his pickup truck to shout ''Get 'em out of the country!'' 
 ''Someone walked by today and said they were going to call ICE,'' said Renata Teodoro, 22, referring to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. 
 The six lawmakers charged with budget negotiations are meeting privately, and while the three senators involved all voted for the new restrictions last month, no clues have emerged about their fate. 
 Gov. Deval Patrick, a Democrat seeking re-election, has refused to say whether he would veto the measure. And but for the group on the steps with their signs, candles and blankets, there appeared to be little focus on the issue this week; a banner across the Statehouse facade cheered on the Boston Celtics, who are facing the Los Angeles Lakers in the National Basketball Association finals and are dominating public attention here. 
 Jose Palma, 22, said he felt obliged to camp out at the Statehouse and buttonhole passers-by about the crackdown to dispel a perception that it would only strengthen existing rules. 
 ''It's not just reinforcing what already exists,'' said Mr. Palma, who left El Salvador in 1998 and has temporary protected status. ''That's why some of us are sacrificing to be here 24/7 -- because we want everybody to understand what it is.''

HEADLINE: Congressional Negotiators Start Effort to Merge Versions of Financial Reform Bills

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Negotiators from the House and Senate gathered on Thursday to merge two bills representing the most comprehensive changes to financial regulation since the Depression, but the script they acted out was largely being written elsewhere.
 Republicans quickly accused Democrats of largely putting on a political show in the form of seven days of televised meetings, including debates scheduled over the next two weeks. The White House wants a final bill on President Obama's desk by July 4. 
 Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, the top Republican on the Senate banking committee, said the biggest differences between the House and Senate bills were being worked out between the Obama administration and Democratic leaders in Congress, and that Republican amendments were unlikely to succeed. 
 ''While I have no illusions about how this process is going to unfold -- some of us can count -- we should at the very least be honest with the American people about what is happening, where it is happening, and who is making those decisions,'' Mr. Shelby said.
 Soon before the start of the meeting, Democrats released a 1,974-page ''base text'' that will be the basis for the negotiations. While it was mostly modeled on the version the Senate passed last month, it included several provisions from the House bill, which was adopted in December. They related to protections of racial minorities, mortgage underwriting and oversight of savings and loans. 
 ''It appears that we are off to a rocky start because the base text before the conference was negotiated and completed behind closed doors, and without any Republican participation,'' Mr. Shelby said. ''In fact, we only received it about two and a half hours ago.'' 
 Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut and the chairman of the banking committee, nominated Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts and the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, to lead the conference.
 The committee of 28 members has 12 senators (seven Democrats and five Republicans) and 16 representatives (10 Democrats and six Republicans). The House had some additional negotiators who will work only on select portions of the bill, like the crucial sections on derivatives trading. 
 Senator Blanche Lincoln, the author of a provision that would require big banks to spin off their lucrative derivatives-trading operations, said the measure would help restore stability to the banking industry.
 ''In my view, banks were never intended to perform these activities in the first place,'' said Mrs. Lincoln, who on Tuesday narrowly won a hard-fought Democratic primary in Arkansas. ''It is this economic activity that contributed to these institutions' growing so large that taxpayers had no choice but to bail them out in order to prevent total economic ruin.''
 Mrs. Lincoln said the provision would make clear that ''derivatives dealing is not central to the business of banking,'' and would still allow banks to use swaps to hedge their loan portfolios and to enter a derivatives contract when originating a loan with a customer. 
 But another negotiator, Senator Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, the top Republican on the agriculture committee, which Mrs. Lincoln leads, said the new rules would interfere with legitimate uses of derivatives. 
 ''We need to make sure that we don't overreach, not down just to Main Street, but into the manufacturing sector, into the energy sector, and into every other sector that uses financial tools to provide quality products to consumers around the world,'' he said. 
 Along with derivatives, another area where the House and Senate bills significantly differ concerns the so-called Volcker Rule, a proposal to stop banks from engaging in proprietary trading, or making market bets with their own money as opposed to trading for their customers' benefit. The Senate bill would restrict such trading after a period of study, and give regulators significant leeway on how to set up the restrictions.
 Several Democratic negotiators, including Representative Paul E. Kanjorski of Pennsylvania and Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, called on Thursday for a far stricter version. They called for reviving some version of the Glass-Steagall Act, the 1933 law that separated commercial banking from investment banking and was watered down before being fully repealed in 1999.
 Republicans, as they have in the past, assailed the legislation for failing to spell out the future of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the mortgage finance giants that have been taken over by the government. 
 Representative Jeb Hensarling, Republican of Texas, said the legislation addressed areas like interchange fees -- which retailers pay every time a debit card is swiped -- and payday loans that did not cause the financial crisis. 
 Both sides called for avoiding a repeat of past mistakes. Representative Maxine Waters, a California Democrat, recalled that she sat on a similar conference committee for the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the milestone deregulation legislation that ended Glass-Steagall. 
 ''I feared deregulation would have serious negative consequences,'' Ms. Waters said. ''I voted no. I was right.''

HEADLINE: Senate Rejects Republican Effort to Thwart Carbon Limits

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Senate on Thursday defeated a Republican-led effort to prevent the Environmental Protection Agency from curbing greenhouse gases as lawmakers road-tested arguments for a future fight over climate change legislation.
 The Senate voted 53-47 to reject an attempt by Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, to block the E.P.A. from imposing new limits on carbon emissions based on its 2009 finding that such gases from industry, vehicles and other sources represent a threat to human health and the environment.
 Ms. Murkowski and others, including six Democrats, contended that the E.P.A. was engaging in a bureaucratic power grab and usurping Congressional authority with regulations that would stifle the economy and kill jobs. 
 ''The sweeping powers being pursued by the E.P.A. are the worst possible option for reducing greenhouse gas emissions,'' said Ms. Murkowski, who tried to thwart the agency's action using a rarely employed procedure called a resolution of disapproval.
 The resolution of disapproval, created in a 1996 law, is a vehicle to allow Congress to overturn an executive branch action and is not subject to filibuster in the Senate. It is seldom used, however, due to the likelihood of a veto. 
 Democratic opponents of the Murkowski proposal said its backers were protecting oil companies and other industrial interests at the expense of public welfare and were ignoring science that substantiated the hazards of greenhouse gas emissions. They said Ms. Murkowski and her allies wanted to prevent the E.P.A. from taking action while simultaneously stalling Congressional action, essentially protecting the status quo.
 ''This is about delay in changes in our energy policy,'' said Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, who said many of Ms. Murkowski's allies ''want nothing to do with comprehensive clean energy and climate legislation. What they want is the E.P.A. to go away.''
 The fight was mainly symbolic because the prospects for the resolution were bleak even had the Senate passed it. It would have then required a majority vote in the House and the approval of President Obama, who has already threatened to veto it.
 But it provided a showcase for a Senate fight over global warming as well as an indicator of where lawmakers could be expected to come down on legislation aimed at carbon emissions. The near-even division among lawmakers showed that a 60-vote supermajority on climate change legislation remains elusive.
 Senate leaders and the White House are continuing to explore whether to push energy legislation on the Senate floor before the midterm elections this November. Senator Harry Reid, the Nevada Democrat and majority leader, was meeting Thursday afternoon with the chairmen of the committees with jurisdiction over energy issues to plot strategy.
 Leading Democrats see the threat of E.P.A. action as an effective way to keep pressure on Congress to consider energy legislation and as a ready alternative if the House and Senate are not able to come to terms on an energy measure.
 Supporters of the plan to block the E.P.A. said they were trying to stop a backdoor attempt by the Obama administration to regulate carbon emissions without waiting for Congress to weigh in. They said the E.P.A. approach would produce little environmental reward while putting the United States at a severe disadvantage to nations that were not imposing such controls on their own industries.
 ''It would be stupid for us to do this now when the rest of the world is not coming along at all,'' said Senator Tom Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma. ''Even if it is the right thing to do, now is not the time to do it.''
 Though Mr. Coburn said the case for global warming is not settled science, several other Republicans said they accepted the scientific assessment that climate change is occurring. They said their main reason for trying to rein in the E.P.A. was concern over handing such far-reaching regulatory power on emissions to an executive agency.
 Given that several backers of Ms. Murkowski's plan said they believed climate change was a reality, senators advocating a broad energy approach that would try to address global warming said defeat of the plan to strip the E.P.A. of regulatory authority over greenhouse gases should provide momentum to their legislative efforts.
 ''Climate change is happening,'' said Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, an independent from Connecticut who is a sponsoring a main climate change bill with Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts. ''The science is convincing and the current pattern of energy consumption is just making a bad problem worse.''

HEADLINE: A Lament for the Blues in Their Backyard

BYLINE: By JESSICA REAVES

 BODY:
Buddy Guy said he was worried about the blues. 
 He worried even as he oversaw the finishing touches on the new location of his club, Buddy Guy's Legends, which is part musical venue, part museum. He is worried that his club cannot provide enough exposure for all the musical talent that comes through Chicago, and worried that young people are not exposed to the music he has loved all his life.
He is worried, in short, that the city's long, proud reign as the world's unequivocal blues capital might be fading into memory. 
 When Mr. Guy arrived here in 1957, it was the heyday of Chess Records, Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf, and there seemed to be a blues venue -- like the 1815 Club, Theresa's, the Blue Flame Lounge -- on every other corner. Some were no more than tiny rooms that could fit 35 people if no one took a deep breath. 
 There were so many clubs, Mr. Guy said, ''you couldn't count them all.''
 One reason the clubs thrived, he said, was because ''back then, everybody had a job.'' People could afford to go out, and everybody wanted to hear the famous Chicago blues.
 ''When the Beatles started, they came here,'' Mr. Guy said. ''When the Rolling Stones started, they were on 21st and Michigan, trying to find Chess Records.'' 
 Those days are long gone. The relocated Legends, which opened its doors on May 28 at 700 South Wabash Avenue, is one of the city's few remaining venues dedicated to live blues. Mr. Guy hopes his club will provide emerging blues musicians with the kind of exposure he got playing at the 708 Club and the Blue Flame. 
 ''If there wasn't a club when I came here, nobody was going to see me walking down 47th Street and say: 'There goes Buddy Guy. One day he's going to be a guitar player,' '' said Mr. Guy, an energetic 74. ''I had to go into those clubs and play.'' 
 Lincoln T. Beauchamp, known as Chicago Beau, is a musician, magazine publisher and author of a book about the city's blues history. The blues community that once flourished on the South and West Sides, Mr. Beauchamp said, fell victim to changing social and economic conditions. 
 ''Pre-integration, the black community was a lot more vibrant,'' he said. ''Along 47th Street and Cottage Grove, you had a community that was able to sustain itself, and the blues and jazz clubs were part of it, not just socially but also politically.'' 
 ''Now, as gentrification takes place and the neighborhoods crumble,'' Mr. Beauchamp said, the social fabric changes and the clubs disappear. ''You'll probably never again see the same kind of deep, soulful pulse coming from the neighborhoods, because the neighborhoods aren't there anymore.'' 
 For the most part, Mr. Beauchamp said, younger black musicians are not drawn to the blues. ''They're not completely detached from it,'' he said, ''because it's part of who we are. But it's just not what inspires them.'' 
 Bruce Iglauer, president and founder of Alligator Records, a major blues and roots record label, said he had watched the blues in Chicago become a tourist attraction -- sanitized, prepackaged music for ''middle-aged white people who discovered it during college,'' he called it. 
 Blues players and their fans are aging, Mr. Iglauer added, and they are not being replaced.
 ''Chicago radio stations don't play the blues, so young people aren't hearing it anywhere,'' he said.
 Although he gives the city credit for continuing to back the Chicago Blues Festival, the annual three-day series of free performances that begins Friday in Grant Park, Mr. Iglauer said the city could be doing ''so much more'' to support club owners. 
 The day before opening night, Mr. Guy showed off his club to Mayor Richard M. Daley, who stopped by for a tour and to pay homage to Mr. Guy.
 ''People come here and the first thing they want to do is hear the blues,'' Mr. Daley said. ''That's the big selling point. They come from all over the world -- heads of state, diplomats.'' 
 Growing up in Louisiana, Mr. Guy was a teenager when his family got a phonograph. He then saved up and sent away for the 78 r.p.m. records of the songs he heard on the radio. 
 When he came to Chicago, Mr. Guy could play the guitar -- ''one or two licks'' -- but he had chosen the city for its promise of steady work and good pay. The music, he said, was secondary. 
 At night, however, he went to blues clubs and watched his heroes strut the small stages, lamenting lost loves and hard times. One day, he said, ''they were asking me to play with them.'' 
 Five decades later, he is still playing an international festival circuit that would exhaust most people half his age. But Chicago is home. 
 ''When I got here, it was September,'' Mr. Guy said, ''and the birds were flying south, back to Louisiana and Texas and Florida. And I told the birds, 'You're smarter than I am.' ''
 Then he started working with the city's top blues players. 
 ''And now they've all left me here,'' he said. ''Someone's got to carry on.''

HEADLINE: Billions of Dollars Ride on Teams' Maneuvers for New Stadiums

BYLINE: By ZUSHA ELINSON; zelinson@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
Jed York, the 29-year-old president of the 49ers, made his way to the American Legion hall in Santa Clara on Tuesday night. 
 The lodge was draped in streamers, and filled with hundreds of fans enjoying beer and barbecued pork sandwiches while awaiting a different kind of final score.
The Niners, who have not made the playoffs since 2002, would win big on this election night, which may ultimately be remembered as the moment when 11,368 people -- well shy of the turnout for an average pre-season game -- reshaped the Bay Area sports scene.
 ''You know, I think I'm one of the luckiest people in the world,'' Mr. York told the raucous crowd after the votes were tallied. 
 Santa Clara's passage of Measure J, a $937 million stadium proposal, by 11,368 to 7,713 (as of Thursday), was the first significant move in a stadium chess game that involves a number of major sports franchises in the area. Those involved include local sports legends and Internet entrepreneurs, and the outcome will affect not only the teams and their fans but also local economies. 
 In many respects, the Niners' proposed move to Santa Clara reflects the continuing shift in economic power from San Francisco to Silicon Valley. The A's are also pursuing a move to San Jose, alienating some fans in strapped Oakland. 
 Even before Tuesday's vote, the 49ers were informally shopping naming rights to the new South Bay stadium for $200 million, according to an industry source familiar with the discussions who was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter.
 ''It's a natural migration,'' Jamie Matthews, an ebullient Santa Clara councilman, said Tuesday at the party after the vote. ''It's the wealth, it's the infrastructure, and it can't hurt that we have 300 days of sunshine a year.''
 Roger G. Noll, a sports economist at Stanford, agreed. ''Why San Jose? Follow the money,'' Dr. Noll said. ''Silicon Valley is the place to be if you want rich companies throwing money at luxury boxes and corporate sponsorships.''
 The Santa Clara vote may have a direct impact on the fortunes of other Bay Area teams. The Raiders also want a new home badly, and few observers believe there is money for two football stadiums. Meanwhile, the Warriors are for sale, and the Giants are considering buying a piece of the team as part of a larger plan to build an arena near AT&T Park.
 The wrangling has led to an inordinate amount of intrigue in the Bay Area sports world. The Niners spent $4.1 million in support of the Santa Clara measure -- more dollars per vote than Meg Whitman spent in the Republican primary for governor. And yet some officials, chief among them Mayor Gavin Newsom of San Francisco, remain unconvinced that the team will actually leave Candlestick Park, its home since 1971.
 ''When the Santa Clara plan falls apart, San Francisco stands ready to welcome its 49ers home,'' Mr. Newsom said Wednesday.
 San Francisco's relationship with the 49ers broke down long ago with John York, Jed's father and the team's co-owner, at odds with Mr. Newsom over plans for a new stadium for the city.
 Carmen Policy, 67, the renowned former 49ers president, whose teams won four Super Bowls in the 1980s and '90s, is working with San Francisco to keep the team in the city. 
 ''What happened was a personal breakdown between the City of San Francisco and John York,'' Mr. Policy said in an interview. ''Once Jed York, the son, took over, he decided to follow through with his father's plans.'' 
 The proposed 68,500-seat Santa Clara stadium, which would be built on the parking lot at Great America, would open for the 2014 season. With Measure J successfully out of the way, the team is turning to the difficult task of raising the nearly $1 billion needed to build it.
 The Niners are relying on a potentially risky financing scheme, according to local government officials and sports economists. Of the anticipated financing, $493 million would come from the 49ers and the N.F.L., and $114 million from the city and a new hotel tax. The team hopes to raise most of the remaining $330 million by selling the naming rights as well as personal seat licenses, that is, paying for the right to buy a choice seat. 
 In an interview, Mr. York said that ''one way or another'' the 49ers would get the money. He denied that the team had tried to put a $200 million price tag on the stadium naming rights. 
 Dr. Noll, the Stanford economist, predicted that financing hurdles still might sink the deal in Santa Clara, saying, ''There's only a 50 percent chance that it gets built.'' With the economy still in recovery and the N.F.L.'s fund for new stadiums currently empty, the league has encouraged the 49ers and the Raiders to build a stadium together.
 But that does not seem likely to happen soon. For their part, the Raiders say they will continue to pursue a new stadium on their own.
 ''We wish them well with their stadium-related efforts as we know they wish us well with ours,'' Amy Trask, the Raiders' chief executive, wrote in an e-mail message.
 As for the 49ers, Mr. Policy said a joint project would be impossible as long as Al Davis, 80, owned the Raiders.
 ''Let me say this,'' Mr. Policy said. ''Al Davis is a Hall of Famer, but he's not the kind of guy you want to be a partner. He's just not capable of making the kind of deal that becomes palatable to the 49ers.'' 
 Where that leaves the Raiders is anybody's guess.
 ''You don't have to be Alan Greenspan, Ben Bernanke or Tim Geithner to figure out that there aren't going be two billion-dollar stadiums built in the Bay Area in our lifetime,'' said Andy Dolich, who served as chief operating officer of the 49ers until earlier this year.
 For many fans, the teams' search for new homes has become intensely personal.
 On May 9, Lew Wolff , the 74-year-old A's owner who also owns the San Jose Earthquakes, invited Jorge Leon, a fan, and his friends to watch an A's game in a luxury box at the Coliseum. Mr. Wolff wanted to explain to them why he was trying to move the team to San Jose. Mr. Leon had been ejected from a game three weeks earlier for holding up a sign that read ''Lew Wolff lied, he never tried,'' a dig at the owner's public statements that he had exhausted all efforts to get a stadium deal in Oakland.
 That night, the owner told Mr. Leon, a San Leandro lab technician who had ''Oakland A's'' tattooed on the inside of his left forearm, that he had wanted to build a stadium in Oakland, but that the city could not come up with the land. 
 Mr. Leon and his friends talked with the A's owner from the third inning on, at first hardly noticing that Dallas Braden was on his way to pitching a perfect game. Mr. Wolff left in the seventh inning, pulling on an Earthquakes jacket as he walked out of the suite. 
 Mr. Leon said he came away from the evening unconvinced by Mr. Wolff. 
 ''I want the A's to stay in Oakland,'' he said. ''They bring so much pride to the city.''

HEADLINE: Iran Warns of 'Reduced' Ties With U.N. Inspectors

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL; William Yong contributed reporting from Tehran.

 BODY:
PARIS -- One day after the Security Council approved new sanctions against them, the authorities in Tehran threatened on Thursday to revise their relationship with the United Nations' nuclear watchdog, using familiar language that has in the past presaged moves to limit global oversight of Iran's nuclear program.
 State-run Press TV quoted Alaeddin Boroujerdi, the head of the National Security and Foreign Policy in the Iranian Parliament, as saying legislators would meet on Sunday to ''push for legislation to reduce'' Iran's relations with the International Atomic Energy Agency. 
 He did not offer details of a likely response to Wednesday's Security Council action, approved by 12 of the 15 members. Brazil and Turkey opposed the measures, and Lebanon abstained. 
 China supported the sanctions and on Thursday, Ali Akbar Salehi, the head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization, sharply criticized Beijing, saying Chinese support for the new measures would ''affect its standing in the Muslim world.''
 ''There was a time when China called the United States a paper tiger,'' he said. ''I am perplexed that China accepted the resolution against Iran in the Security Council. What name does China deserve?'' he asked, accusing China of ''two-faced behavior'' in its divergent policies toward the nuclear ambitions of North Korea and Iran.
 For their part, Turkey and Brazil had reached a contentious deal with Iran last month on an exchange of nuclear fuel that they hoped would avert a worsening confrontation with Tehran. In a speech on Thursday, Turkish prime minister Recip Tayyip Erdogan called the Security Council vote an error. 
 ''We would not want to participate in such a mistake because history will not forgive us,'' he told a meeting of ministers from the Arab League, Reuters reported.
 The sanctions are designed to curb military purchases, trade and financial transactions carried out by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, which controls the nuclear program and has taken a more central role in running the country and the economy. 
 Although Iran insists that its nuclear efforts are strictly for peaceful purposes, its actions have raised suspicions in the West that it Tehran is seeking to build nuclear weapons.
 The nuclear relationship is governed by formal agreements with the International Atomic Energy Agency that provide for inspectors to visit nuclear facilities, such as the main, publicly known enrichment plant at Natanz, and require Iran to notify the nuclear body of its plans to build new facilities.
 The agency offered no immediate comment on the Iranian threats.
 Western officials familiar with the nuclear debate, who spoke in return for anonymity because they were not authorized to brief reporters, said that I.A.E.A. inspectors were currently able to visit Iranian facilities, albeit within a ''minimal level'' of cooperation.
 In the past, the officials said, Iranian threats to downgrade ties to the I.A.E.A. have been followed by measures to curb inspectors' authority and to slow notification of its intentions. The newest threats could lead to further restrictions on inspectors' visits, the officials said.
 The officials said Western governments believed that Iran might also react to the sanctions by expanding its enrichment process at Natanz, doubling the number of centrifuges producing uranium enriched to 20 percent. 
 Currently, Iran is using a cascade of 164 centrifuges -- machines that enrich, or purify, uranium for use in bombs or reactors -- to produce uranium to 20 percent purity. But it has a second cascade of the same size that has not yet been activated, the officials said.
 In February, Iran also said it planned to build 10 more nuclear-fuel enrichment plants -- two within the next year -- and had identified ''close to'' 20 sites for such facilities.
 Earlier this month, I.A.E.A. inspectors reported that Iran has produced over 5,300 pounds of low-enriched uranium, all of which would have to undergo further enrichment before it could be converted to bomb fuel. 
 Until recently, all of Iran's uranium had been enriched to only 4 percent, the level needed to run nuclear power reactors. While enrichment to 20 percent purity does not allow Iran to build a weapon, it moves the country closer to that goal.

HEADLINE: Pressed to Show Progress, Educators Tamper With Test Scores

BYLINE: By TRIP GABRIEL

 BODY:
The staff of Normandy Crossing Elementary School outside Houston eagerly awaited the results of state achievement tests this spring. For the principal and assistant principal, high scores could buoy their careers at a time when success is increasingly measured by such tests. For fifth-grade math and science teachers, the rewards were more tangible: a bonus of $2,850.
 But when the results came back, some seemed too good to be true. Indeed, after an investigation by the Galena Park Independent School District, the principal, assistant principal and three teachers resigned May 24 in a scandal over test tampering. 
 The district said the educators had distributed a detailed study guide after stealing a look at the state science test by ''tubing'' it -- squeezing a test booklet, without breaking its paper seal, to form an open tube so that questions inside could be seen and used in the guide. The district invalidated students' scores. 
 Of all the forms of academic cheating, none may be as startling as educators tampering with children's standardized tests. But investigations in Georgia, Indiana, Massachusetts, Nevada, Virginia and elsewhere this year have pointed to cheating by educators. Experts say the phenomenon is increasing as the stakes over standardized testing ratchet higher -- including, most recently, taking student progress on tests into consideration in teachers' performance reviews. 
 Colorado passed a sweeping law last month making teachers' tenure dependent on test results, and nearly a dozen other states have introduced plans to evaluate teachers partly on scores. Many school districts already link teachers' bonuses to student improvement on state assessments. Houston decided this year to use the data to identify experienced teachers for dismissal, and New York City will use it to make tenure decisions on novice teachers.
 The federal No Child Left Behind law is a further source of pressure. Like a high jump bar set intentionally low in the beginning, the law -- which mandates that public schools bring all students up to grade level in reading and math by 2014 -- was easy to satisfy early on. But the bar is notched higher annually, and the penalties for schools that fail to get over it also rise: teachers and administrators can lose jobs and see their school taken over.
 No national data is collected on educator cheating. Experts who consult with school systems estimated that 1 percent to 3 percent of teachers -- thousands annually -- cross the line between accepted ways of boosting scores, like using old tests to prep students, and actual cheating. 
 ''Educators feel that their schools' reputation, their livelihoods, their psychic meaning in life is at stake,'' said Robert Schaeffer, public education director for FairTest, a nonprofit group critical of standardized testing. ''That ends up pushing more and more of them over the line.'' 
 Others say that every profession has some bad apples, and that high-stakes testing is not to blame. Gregory J. Cizek, an education professor at the University of North Carolina who studies cheating, said infractions were often kept quiet. ''One of the real problems is states have no incentive to pursue this kind of problem,'' he said. 
 Recent scandals illustrate the many ways, some subtle, that educators improperly boost scores: 
 At a charter school in Springfield, Mass., the principal told teachers to look over students' shoulders and point out wrong answers as they took the 2009 state tests, according to a state investigation. The state revoked the charter for the school, Robert M. Hughes Academy, in May. 
 In Norfolk, Va., an independent panel detailed in March how a principal -- whose job evaluations had faulted the poor test results of special education students -- pressured teachers to use an overhead projector to show those students answers for state reading assessments, according to The Virginian-Pilot, citing a leaked copy of the report.
 In Georgia, the state school board ordered investigations of 191 schools in February after an analysis of 2009 reading and math tests suggested that educators had erased students' answers and penciled in correct responses. Computer scanners detected the erasures, and classrooms in which wrong-to-right erasures were far outside the statistical norm were flagged as suspicious. 
 The Georgia scandal is the most far-reaching in the country. It has already led to the referral of 11 teachers and administrators to a state agency with the power to revoke their licenses. More disciplinary referrals, including from a dozen Atlanta schools, are expected. 
 John Fremer, a specialist in data forensics who was hired by an independent panel to dig deeper into the Atlanta schools, and who investigated earlier scandals in Texas and elsewhere, said educator cheating was rising. ''Every time you increase the stakes associated with any testing program, you get more cheating,'' he said. 
 That was also the conclusion of the economist Steven D. Levitt, of ''Freakonomics'' fame and a blogger for The New York Times, who with a colleague studied answer sheets from Chicago public schools after the introduction of high-stakes testing in the 1990s concluded that 4 percent to 5 percent of elementary school teachers cheat. 
 Not everyone agrees. Beverly L. Hall, who, as the superintendent of the Atlanta Public Schools has won national recognition for elevating test scores, said dishonesty was relatively low in education. ''Teachers over all are principled people in terms of wanting to be sure what they teach is what students are learning,'' she said. 
 Educators ensnared in cheating scandals rarely admit to wrongdoing. But at one Georgia school last year, a principal and an assistant principal acknowledged their roles in a test-erasure scandal. 
 For seven years, their school, Atherton Elementary in suburban Atlanta, had met the standards known in federal law as Adequate Yearly Progress -- A.Y.P. in educators' jargon -- by demonstrating that a rising share of students performed at grade level. 
 Then, in 2008, the bar went up again and Atherton stumbled. In June, the school's assistant principal for instruction, reviewing student answer sheets from the state tests, told her principal, ''We cannot make A.Y.P.,'' according to an affidavit the principal signed. 
 ''We didn't discuss it any further,'' the principal, James L. Berry, told school district investigators. ''We both understood what we meant.'' 
 Pulling a pencil from a cup on the desk of Doretha Alexander, the assistant principal, Dr. Berry said to her, ''I want you to call the answers to me,'' according to an account Ms. Alexander gave to investigators. 
 The principal erased bubbles on the multiple-choice answer sheets and filled in the right answers. 
 Any celebrations over the results were short-lived. Suspicions were raised in December 2008 by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, which noted that improvements on state tests at Atherton and a handful of other Georgia schools were so spectacular that they approached a statistical impossibility. The state conducted an analysis of the answer sheets and found ''overwhelming evidence'' of test tampering at Atherton. 
 Crawford Lewis, the district superintendent at the time, summoned Dr. Berry and Ms. Alexander to separate meetings. During four hours of questioning -- ''back and forth, back and forth, back and forth,'' Dr. Lewis said -- principal and assistant principal admitted to cheating.
 ''They both broke down'' in tears, Dr. Lewis said. 
 Dr. Lewis said that Dr. Berry, whom he had appointed in 2005, had buckled under the pressure of making yearly progress goals. Dr. Berry was a former music teacher and leader of celebrated marching bands who, Dr, Lewis said, had transferred some of that spirit to passing the state tests in a district where schools hold pep rallies to get ready. 
 Dr. Berry, who declined interview requests, resigned and was arrested in June 2009 on charges of falsifying a state document. In December, he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to probation. The state suspended him from education for two years and Ms. Alexander for one year.
 Dr. Lewis, now retired as superintendent, called for refocusing education away from high-stakes testing because of the distorted incentives it introduces for teachers. ''When you add in performance pay and your evaluation could possibly be predicated on how well your kids do testing-wise, it's just an enormous amount of pressure,'' he said. 
 ''I don't say there's any excuse for doing what was done, but I believe this problem is going to intensify before it gets better.'' 
 Cheat Sheet: Articles in this series will examine cheating in education and efforts to stop it.

HEADLINE: Horror and Injustice Play Starring Roles

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
It is one of the most stunning moments in ''Enemies of the People,'' a documentary that revisits the Cambodian killing fields of the late 1970s, and a high point of the Human Rights Watch Film Festival opening on Friday at Lincoln Center. Thet Sambath, a Cambodian journalist whose father and older brother were among the two million slaughtered by the Khmer Rouge, coaxes a Cambodian farmer who carried out its lethal orders to describe his method of execution.
The farmer recalls in a dispassionate tone how a fellow soldier would grab the bowed head of a kneeling prisoner and wrench it back so he could slit the victim's throat. After a while, he notes, his arm would tire, and instead of slitting throats, he would simply jab in the knife. 
But the movie's ultimate coup is Mr. Thet Sambath's interview with the octogenarian Nuon Chea, known at Brother No. 2, who was the chief ideologue of Pol Pot, the Khmer Rouge leader. The old man explains that the Khmer Rouge was determined to establish a form of Communism that was even purer than Chinese Communism under Mao Zedong.
For all the horrors recollected, ''Enemies of the People,'' which Mr. Thet Sambath made with Rob Lemkin and which has the first of three festival screenings on June 18 at the Walter Reade Theater, is an inspiring film. To hear people recall committing unspeakable acts while under duress is liberating for them and for us. And the story of Mr. Thet Sambath, who spent years researching and interviewing, is a testament to one man's persistent search for the truth. The faces and voices of these ordinary people forced to kill raises the age-old question: Who, in the same situation, would have acted differently?
Such issues are addressed each year by the Human Rights Watch Film Festival, a traveling program of films about injustice and courage, now in its 21st year. The New York segment of the festival consists of 30 films from 25 countries that will be screened at the Walter Reade through June 24.
Although the festival includes features, documentaries predominate. As the documentary bubble that began with Michael Moore's ''Bowling for Columbine'' and ''Fahrenheit 9/11'' deflates in today's leaner economic times, the Human Rights Watch Film Festival is one of the foremost showcases of serious nonfiction films, only a handful of which will end up on television.
After Thursday night's benefit screening of ''The Balibo Conspiracy,'' a drama set in 1975 in East Timor and based on the actual search for five missing Australian journalists, the festival begins public screenings on Friday with the New York premiere of Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady's documentary ''12th & Delaware.''
Made by the team behind the 2006 film ''Jesus Camp,'' the movie is a remarkably evenhanded exploration of the intractable divide between abortion-rights and anti-abortion advocates on a street corner in Fort Pierce, Fla. On one side of the street is an abortion clinic, from which doctors emerge covered in sheets to protect their identity. On the other is a pregnancy-care center that some women mistakenly enter thinking they are going to the abortion clinic. Pickets, mostly anti-abortion demonstrators, patrol the street and entreat the women visiting the clinic to reconsider.
For all the zealotry on display, ''12th & Delaware'' is about as far from a polemical screaming match as a movie about such a divisive issue could be. Anti-abortion demonstrators explain their conviction, usually religiously based and visceral, that abortion is murder. And the nurses and assistants inside the clinic describe their struggle to help women in the face of hostility and the risk of violence. We hear the voices (but rarely see the faces) of several patients who receive gentle, thoughtful, unpressured counseling from staff members. I can't think of another film on the subject that keeps its cool and allows both sides to be heard at medium decibel.
A gripping feature film scattered among the documentaries and set in Haiti a few years ago, Raoul Peck's ''Moloch Tropical'' is a satirically edged melodrama about the corruption of absolute power. The president, who is going mad, lives in luxury in a hilltop fortress, below which the festering misery of the populace is about to explode. A 200th-anniversary celebration of Haitian independence is being prepared, but as the unrest comes to a boil, distinguished guests and celebrities from the around the world send their regrets.
The president (Zinedine Soualem), though democratically elected, is a torturer and sexual predator. Mr. Soualem's brooding intensity evokes Frank Langella's in ''Frost/Nixon'' but amplified to demented, Shakespearean proportions. After festival screenings of ''Moloch Tropical,'' some critics called it a comedy. I'm not so sure.
''War Don Don'' examines the aftermath of the civil war in Sierra Leone and the trial for war crimes of Issa Sesay, the highest-ranking survivor of the Revolutionary United Front, which fought the government for a decade. The film, directed by Rebecca Richman Cohen, is less an investigation of guilt for war crimes than a contemplation of the viability of international courts. The film suggests that the hundreds of millions of American and British funds spent to build the court might better have been used to revive Sierra Leone's shattered economy.
The closing-night film, ''Presumed Guilty,'' directed by Roberto Hernandez and Geoffrey Smith, examines the case of Tono Zuniga, a Mexican scooped off the street in Mexico City and sentenced to 20 years for a murder he knew nothing about. The film follows the three-year crusade of two young lawyers, Mr. Hernandez and Layda Negrete, to get Mr. Zuniga a retrial. Against a background of Mexican courts and prisons, the film portrays a national justice system that tends to presume guilt and often uses torture and prolonged detention to elicit confessions.
As calamities and political conflicts around the world accumulate, and it is ever more tempting to throw up your hands, the Human Rights Watch Film Festival is fighting the tide of cynicism and despair. The Chinese proverb that Adlai E. Stevenson made famous in a 1962 tribute to Eleanor Roosevelt -- that it is better to light a candle than to curse the darkness -- applies to the Human Rights Watch Film Festival. The illumination isn't a candle but the light on a movie screen.
The Human Rights Watch Film Festival runs through June 24 at Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center; filmlinc.com or hrw.org/iff.

HEADLINE: Enthusiasm for Economy Sends Markets Surging

BYLINE: By SUSANNA G. KIM; David Jolly contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The stock market roared back to life on Thursday, driving the Dow Jones industrial average firmly above 10,000, as investors latched on to hopes that maybe, just maybe, the economic scene was not quite as bleak as it seemed. 
 After weeks of violent swings, driven largely by concerns over the unfolding financial crisis in Europe, bargain-hunters swooped in. The broad stock market leapt almost 3 percent in its biggest one-day gain in two weeks. 
 For a day, at least, fears that the nation's fragile economic recovery might falter were cast aside. A stream of upbeat economic reports overseas prompted some investors to reverse their bearish bets with a rush of buy orders. 
 But few investors or analysts seemed convinced that the market, down roughly 11 percent from its April highs, was finally out of the woods. Indeed, some suggested the gains might prove fleeting, given the nervousness pervading the markets. 
 ''Investors are spooked very easily by the smallest negative news stories now, and it won't take a lot for the Dow to be trading back to 10,000 as early as tomorrow,'' said M. Jake Dollarhide, the chief executive of Longbow Asset Management.
 Even before the opening bell sounded, it looked like a good day for Wall Street. Thursday's rally began early, in Asian markets, and then spilled over into European trading. The United States market gathered momentum into the close of New York trading, as some traders reversed short positions, or bets that stocks would decline in value.
 By the close, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 273.28 points, or 2.76 percent, at 10,172.53. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 2.95 percent, or 31.15 points, to 1,086.84, while the Nasdaq was up 2.77 percent, or 59.86 points, to 2,218.71.
 The rally was broad and swift. Energy shares led the charge. BP, which has lost nearly half its value since the disastrous oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, jumped 10 percent. Only a day before, BP had plunged nearly 16 percent after lawmakers called on the company to suspend its dividends and its advertising to pay for the costs of the cleanup. 
 Driving the gains were several economic reports, mostly from overseas, that seemed to point to a sustainable global recovery. The European Central Bank slightly raised its forecast for economic growth in the euro zone this year, while the Japanese government reported that its economy grew 1.2 percent in the first quarter. 
 A stronger-than-expected employment report in Australia and news that New Zealand was confident enough in its economic prospects to raise interest rates added to the sense of optimism, as did better-than-expected results on weekly jobless claims in the United States. 
 Good news also came from China, in the form of surprisingly strong export figures. To some, the data -- a trade surplus of $19.5 billion in May -- suggested that China's economy remained robust, despite troubles elsewhere in the world. 
 ''China has been the economic juggernaut, and at least it's not falling apart,'' said Michael Fitzpatrick, vice president for energy at MF Global. 
 Others, however, insisted that the Chinese economy would ultimately slow down, posing a risk to growth worldwide. 
 ''Whether it's going to be a soft landing or hard landing -- that to me is the most fundamental risk,'' said Stephen P. Wood, market strategist for Russell Investments. ''That's really the big wild card.'' 
 Mr. Wood said a slowdown in China was ''inevitable.''
 Indeed, many on Wall Street say they believe the economic outlook remains murky at best. 
 A report showing that weekly unemployment benefit rolls in the United States fell by 255,000 to a seasonally adjusted 4.5 million, the lowest total since December 2008, provided some relief to downbeat news of late. But the report was not enough to persuade economists that unemployment would decline markedly soon. 
 Scott J. Brown, chief economist of Raymond James, said the jobs numbers from Thursday and last Friday indicated a ''long hard slog'' ahead. 
 ''The recovery should continue, but it may not be strong enough to push the unemployment rate down very much,'' Mr. Brown said. 
 Mr. Wood said American economic data like Thursday's claims numbers were ''not bad, but not great.''
 ''Jobless rate leads to consumer confidence, which leads to consumer spending,'' Mr. Wood said. ''The key is consumption. The employment situation is the basis for consumer sentiment and behavior. And we're seeing stabilization and a modest improvement in that.''
 Mr. Wood acknowledged that risks from the oil spill and the European debt crisis could still affect the United States' growth, which the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, indicated would be 3.5 percent this year as long as the markets held. 
 Mr. Fitzpatrick said the news from China was more significant than the increase in jobless claims. ''But to say they're going to carry the entire world out of a recession is out of the question if their customers around the world are mired in a recession,'' Mr. Fitzpatrick said. 
 In Europe, the Euro Stoxx 50 index, a barometer of euro zone blue chips, settled 2 percent higher, while the FTSE 100 index added 0.92 percent in London.

HEADLINE: Big Banks, U.S. Cities, Common Space

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

 BODY:
LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- A $238 million basketball arena is rising on Main Street, financed through a bond deal underwritten by Goldman Sachs.
 At the corner of Main and Fourth sits a branch of UBS Financial Services, the brokerage arm of the giant Swiss bank. Once known as Whiskey Row, Main Street and the surrounding blocks are now lined with bank towers: BB&T, PNC, National City and Your Community Bank. 
 As Congressional negotiators begin the final stages of overhauling the financial regulatory system, with a hope of preventing or limiting economic crises, many lawmakers have portrayed Wall Street and Main Street as fiercely at odds. The Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, denounced the bill at one point, saying, ''It punishes Main Street for the sins of Wall Street.'' 
 But here in Mr. McConnell's hometown, Main Street seems to be an extension of Wall Street. At 333 East Main is B. F. Capital, an investment and venture capital firm. Actors Theater of Louisville, at 316 West Main, counts Chase bank among its leading corporate sponsors. 
 ''As Wall Street and Washington go, so goes Main Street,'' said Jack Guthrie, a past president of the Louisville Main Street Association. ''Indirectly and directly, Main Street is connected.'' 
 Louisville is not alone. Across the country, the loose rhetoric pitting Wall Street against Main Street is contradicted, in brick, steel and glass, by buildings like the Merrill Lynch Tower on East Main Street in Richmond, Va., or the Bank of America Plaza on Main Street in Dallas -- hard evidence that in the modern American financial system, Main Street scarcely exists in isolation from New York. 
 Put another way, Main Street seems less an innocent victim of Wall Street in the financial crisis of 2008 than a savvy counterparty, whose own dealings contributed to the days of easy credit and overinflated real estate prices that led to the collapse. 
 ''I don't think anybody skirts the responsibility of borrowing properly,'' said Dale J. Boden, the president of B. F. Capital. ''Certainly we saw it in some of our multifamily residential developments -- condominiums -- where those mortgage lenders out there soliciting the business were very aggressive. If you were warm and could make an X on the page, you were almost guaranteed to qualify.'' 
 In Louisville, most of Main Street sits just a block away from the mighty Ohio River, which fostered the city's growth as a major port mainly because of the Falls of the Ohio, a two-mile stretch of often impassable rapids over which the river dropped 26 feet. This made Louisville a natural stopping point on each side of the falls for ships traveling between Pittsburgh and Illinois, where the Ohio meets the Mississippi.
 Louisville is a city of about 560,000 people whose first loves are still its bourbon, its baseball bats and a yearly horse race called the Derby. Its Main Street is still home to Brown-Forman, the maker of Jack Daniels, as well as to Hillerich & Bradsby, which makes Louisville Slugger baseball bats and has a factory and museum on the block. 
 In recent years, Louisville has become a major health care center, and Humana, the big insurer, occupies several buildings on Main Street.
 And as part of an aggressive push to revive the downtown area, Main Street has undergone a major revitalization with hip bars and restaurants, new apartment buildings and businesses. For instance, Bridges Smith & Company, a paint store in Louisville for 135 years, is succumbing to competition from giants like Wal-Mart Stores. Its building and adjacent properties on East Main Street were bought by Indatus, a data and telecommunications company that is undertaking a $4.4 million renovation project. 
 Some of the connections between Wall Street and Main Street are readily apparent. In the lobby of the UBS branch, four copies of The Wall Street Journal lay on a table next to an elegant gray-green sofa, where investors can wait to see a broker. A receptionist referred questions to a central office in Weehawken, N.J. 
 Other connections are more subtle. One warning issued by Republicans about the financial regulation bill is that it would interfere with the ability of local business owners, including auto dealers and even dentists, to extend credit to their customers. 
 But at the Metro Dental Group, at 301 East Main Street in Louisville, customers needing a payment plan do not apply for a loan directly from their doctor but are directed to CareCredit, a unit of General Electric that provides health care financing through a nationwide network. 
 Despite all the interconnectedness between Main Street and Wall Street, Ballard W. Cassady Jr., the president of the Kentucky Bankers Association, which has its offices on Main Street in Louisville, warned that local banks and American consumers had serious reasons to fear the financial regulatory legislation. He said Mr. McConnell was right to oppose the measure. 
 Mr. Cassady said that banks throughout the state would face onerous regulations that could put some out of business, and that a new consumer financial protection agency could impose rules that would raise costs for businesses and consumers. Rather than focusing on the unregulated mortgage lenders who caused the subprime crisis, he said, Washington was treating all banks as the same. 
 ''Congress is painting them both with the same brush,'' Mr. Cassady said. ''Being a community bank is more a state of mind than size. Even the largest of banks in the state of Kentucky are community-minded.'' 
 Still, on Main Street, even some of the smallest businesses recognize the need to follow the wider financial markets. 
 At G&K Army Goods, a military surplus store that has been at 639 West Main Street since 1937, the owner, Julian Goldberg, 80, noted that construction had been halted on a proposed 60-story office tower directly behind his building because credit markets had dried up. 
 ''I don't know when the developers are going to be able to get financing anymore,'' said Mr. Goldberg, who has an M.B.A. from the University of Michigan and was standing amid a jumble of boots, canvas bags and camouflage gear. 
 ''Look at the three-month Libor -- what's it up to, 0.50?'' he asked, referring to the benchmark rate in London at which banks lend to each other, which has roughly doubled in the last few months. 
 Across the street, Damon Thompson, who parks cars for customers at Morton's Steakhouse, said he could not help but notice that the suit-and-tie lunch crowd constantly checked the markets on their cellphones. 
 Further down Main, Kevin O'Brien, the executive director of the Kentucky Museum of Art and Craft on West Main Street, said he found the financial regulation issue baffling. ''It's all voodoo to me,'' he said. Still, Mr. O'Brien said, Wall Street has a role even in the local arts because corporate sponsors, including banks, are crucial. 
 A few blocks from Main Street, at the offices of River Road Asset Management, the president, Andrew Beck, said he welcomed many of the provisions in the financial regulatory bill, which he said would ''level the playing field'' by requiring the hedge funds he competes with to comply with many of the rules that his company already must obey. 
 But no matter how much Wall Street seemed to encroach on Main Street, Mr. Beck said, his company was committed to its Midwestern sensibility, and that an ad slogan created after the burst of the dot-com bubble was more popular than ever.
 In the ad, his money management firm declares itself ''ideally situated, 738 miles from Wall Street.''

HEADLINE: The Message From Arkansas

 BODY:
They may not have won, but discontented Democrats sent an important message to the Obama administration on Tuesday by mounting an unexpectedly strong primary challenge to Senator Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas. For the White House to minimize the efforts of unions and others who helped support that challenge suggests a tone-deafness to the growing restlessness in the Democratic Party. 
 After Mrs. Lincoln narrowly defeated Lt. Gov. Bill Halter in the primary runoff, a senior White House official told Politico.com that organized labor had just wasted $10 million in its ''pointless'' support of Mr. Halter, money that could have been better spent against Republicans in the November general election. David Axelrod, the president's senior adviser, told The Washington Post that ''good progressive candidates around the country'' could have benefited from that money. 
 Within the cocoon of the White House, that sort of pragmatism may make sense, but the unions had every right to spend their money as they saw fit, and the White House should be paying attention to the signals that were sent, not to the ones they wish they had heard.
 Some of the anger toward Mrs. Lincoln is anti-incumbent sentiment, which we've seen in other races this year. But much of it was more specific. Many on the left were unhappy with her for opposing a public option in the health care law, for opposing bills making it easier to unionize and for being more concerned about deficits than about stimulating the economy and creating jobs. 
 Mrs. Lincoln battled back valiantly, propelled in part by her surprisingly tough stance against big banks as the chairwoman of the agriculture committee. But Mr. Halter got 47 percent of the vote in a state that, as the Web site fivethirtyeight.com points out, has the lowest fraction of union members in the country.
 Clearly, many of the voters who complained that Democratic officials had lost their phone number after being elected were also referring to President Obama. Many Democrats don't understand why the administration and Congressional leaders are giving in to trumped-up Republican fears about the deficit and not doing more to revive the economy. Rather than dismissing such concerns and ridiculing efforts at change, the White House should consider just how powerful they have become. There are virtues to pragmatism, but it should be in the service of an underlying principle.

HEADLINE: U.S. Fury at BP Stirs Backlash Among British

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL and JULIA WERDIGIER

 BODY:
LONDON -- Spewing oil and alienating Americans with its chief executive's impolitic remarks, BP may be Public Enemy No. 1 in the United States. But in Britain, where the company is a mainstay of the stock market and a favorite of pension funds, investors and politicians are becoming increasingly angry at the blistering attacks from across the Atlantic. 
 BP's share price, even after recovering some ground in New York trading on Thursday, has fallen more than 40 percent since the environmental catastrophe in April, and some analysts say the crisis could lead to the takeover or even the bankruptcy of one of Britain's most valuable and iconic companies. 
 In that atmosphere, the stream of condemnations from Washington has stirred a protective backlash, even in this closest of American allies. Boris Johnson, the Conservative mayor of London, said Thursday that he was worried about ''anti-British rhetoric'' and ''name-calling'' from American politicians. 
 ''When you consider the huge exposure of British pension funds to BP, it starts to become a matter of national concern if a great British company is being continually beaten up on the airwaves,'' Mr. Johnson told BBC radio's Today program. 
 Prime Minister David Cameron refused to criticize the United States, however, saying he sympathized with its ''frustration'' in dealing with its worst environmental disaster in memory. But the chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, signaled careful support for BP, saying that he had spoken to its chief executive, Tony Hayward, and that it was important to remember ''the economic value BP brings to people in Britain and America.''
 BP is the third largest oil company in the world, after ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch Shell, with 80,000 employees worldwide as of last December, sales of $239 billion in 2009 and a market value -- even after the recent losses -- of more than $100 billion. At a time when Britain is desperate to reduce its deficit, BP is a huge contributor to British tax revenue, paying nearly $1.4 billion in taxes on its profits last year. 
 Its reputation for reliability and its generous dividends have long made it a favorite of British pension funds. The company's dividend payments accounted for about 13 percent of the dividends handed out by British companies last year, according to FairPensions, a London-based charity.
 Some Britons are irked at President Obama's seeming determination to refer to the company as ''British Petroleum'' -- even though it jettisoned that name in favor of initials years ago. In any case, they point out, it is truly a multinational company, traded on both the New York and London stock exchanges, with British and American nationals on its board of directors. 
 BP also has extensive holdings in the United States. It merged with Amoco, the former Standard Oil of Indiana, in 1998, and about 40 percent of its shares are held by American investors. It owns a refinery in Texas City, Tex., that is one of the world's largest, and a 50 percent interest in the Trans Alaska Pipeline, in addition to a huge gasoline marketing operation. 
 But alarms went off in Britain when President Obama said earlier this week that he would have fired Mr. Hayward, BP's chief executive, if Mr. Hayward worked for him and that he was looking for ''whose ass to kick'' in connection with the disaster. The Justice Department did not help matters when it said Wednesday that it was planning to take action to force BP to withhold its next dividend payment. 
 Iain Armstrong, an analyst at Brewin Dolphin, an investment manager here, said that the situation had become ''overpoliticized'' and had confused the markets about BP's actual strength. 
 ''It's gotten completely out of hand,'' he said. ''Ironically, by being extremely strong financially, BP has become a target.'' 
 In an attempt to soothe panicking investors and dispel fears that it could face bankruptcy or be forced to put itself up for sale, BP said Thursday that it had ''significant capacity and flexibility in dealing with the cost of responding to the incident, the environmental remediation and the payment of legitimate claims.'' Speaking of its performance on the stock market since Wednesday, it said it was ''not aware of any reason which justifies this share price movement.'' 
 Many Britons are upset at what they see not just as the economic costs of American anger, but also at language they say demonizes Britain, America's partner in the so-called special relationship -- loose talk that taps into the British suspicion that Americans are insular and overly nationalistic.
 Writing on his Web site, a Conservative peer, Lord Tebbit, called the American response ''a crude, bigoted, xenophobic display of partisan, political, presidential petulance against a multinational company.''
 Comments on British message boards this week have been full of anger at the United States and disillusionment at Mr. Obama, a wildly popular president here until now.
 ''The rest of the world is fed up with the parasitic attitude of the U.S.,'' went one representative comment on the Daily Telegraph Web site. ''As a Dutch citizen, I used to be a supporter of the U.S., but not anymore. You want the oil? You clean up the mess.'' 
 Even as Mr. Obama has been attacked at home for his mild manner, so has Mr. Cameron, the new prime minister, been criticized here for not standing up more forcefully to the United States as BP's fortunes have continued to plummet. 
 ''The government must put down a marker with the U.S. administration that the survival and long-term prosperity of BP is a vital British interest,'' Sir Christopher Meyer, a former British ambassador to the United States, told the BBC. 
 But Mr. Cameron himself, apparently eager not to offend his American ally, took a mollifying tone. He said he would discuss the situation with Mr. Obama when the two next spoke, in a scheduled telephone call this weekend.
 ''I completely understand the U.S. government's frustration, because it's catastrophic for the environment,'' he told reporters during a trip to Afghanistan. ''BP needs to do everything it can to clear up the situation. The most important thing is to mitigate the effects and get to the root of the problem.'' 
 On Thursday in Washington, the Obama administration tried to play down the diplomatic tensions, saying the issue was purely between a private company and the United States government. ''This is not about the relationship between the United States and its closest ally,'' a State Department spokesman, P. J. Crowley, told reporters.

HEADLINE: Drawing Social Security

BYLINE: By THE NEW YORK TIMES

 BODY:
''Ask an Expert'' is a recurring feature on Bucks where you have the opportunity to question big-brained individuals about a particular area of personal finance or consumer affairs.
 This week, our attention is on Social Security, specifically, the optimal time to start collecting. Determining that is difficult given the many complicated rules that govern the system. So it's not surprising that ever since we wrote about the topic last summer, readers have not stopped sending us their questions. That's why we've called in Lesley J. Brey, a financial planner with expertise in Social Security, to answer them.
 Ms. Brey founded L.J. Brey Inc. in 1997 to provide personalized, fee-only financial planning and investment advisory services. The firm's clients are primarily couples and widows, though her work with multiple generations has helped her understand issues affecting all ages.
 Ms. Brey is a member of the National Association of Personal Financial Advisors, the National Association of Tax Professionals and the Financial Planning Association. She is also a Certified Financial Planner licensee, a Chartered Financial Analyst charter holder and an Accredited Investment Fiduciary designee. 
 Raised in Hawaii, Ms. Brey has a bachelor's degree in mathematics from Pomona College, a master's degree in engineering from Stanford University and a master's in business administration from Chaminade University in Hawaii. Her practical education includes 13 years in fee-only financial planning after 14 years in the petroleum industry.
 Ms. Brey has presented nationally and internationally on Social Security and retirement planning, among other topics. She is based in Hawaii. What better place than a retirement mecca to master the rules of Social Security?
 Her first set of answers can be found below. If you have a question, please submit it in the comment section of our original post.Q.I started collecting Social Security at age 62 when I had to shut down my business. I am now 66 and coming into an inheritance. How do I figure out whether or not it would be in my best interest to repay the Social Security I've received so far and begin to collect at the higher rate to which I would now be entitled? JB, NYC
 I receive a modest amount per month (began when I was 62), and I am about to turn 64. Considering withdrawing from Social Security; paying back funds received, and waiting until 66 for full benefits. But I suffer from double-dipping syndrome -- Social Security will never be a windfall for me since I already receive a pension. Is my new tactic a sound one? And since they froze our benefits (what cost of living increase?) how do I know they won't just continue to keep freezing, so benefits at the end of the rainbow (age 66) could be the same ... so might as well continue as is. PF, San DiegoA.I don't presume to be a visionary on Social Security policy but would like to clear up the comment about ''freezing'' payments from 2009 to 2010.
 Social Security benefit payments increase each year based on the change in an independent measure of inflation called the Consumer Price Index for, essentially, the year prior to the adjustment. Since the Consumer Price Index did not change in the measuring period before 2010 there was no increase in payments. If there continues to be no inflation in the future, there will be no nominal increase in Social Security benefits though your purchasing power will remain the same -- which is the goal of cost-of-living adjustments.
 The question of ''withdrawing'' from Social Security by repaying all benefits received to date (or reverting to ''eligible'' status) to establish a higher payment moving forward rests on a bit of philosophy. Unless you know when you are going to die, there is no right answer to this question. But if you want to ensure that you (or your spouse who has a lower benefit than you) have the highest possible guaranteed income if either of you live to a ripe old age, then you might look at receiving the higher payments as a form of longevity insurance.
 To see if paying back Social Security makes sense in the marketplace, you could compare the amount you would return to Social Security -- and the increased benefits you would receive -- with a high-quality, single-premium, inflation-adjusted immediate annuity for the same cost. Then, you may be able to judge if the Social Security option is a ''good deal'' in the marketplace.
 In both cases, if you die relatively quickly you will probably receive fewer dollars and if you live a good long time you will probably receive more dollars. This is the ''longevity insurance'' philosophy of maximizing Social Security retirement benefit payments. It's a guaranteed payment for life, increasing with inflation, backed by a strong financial entity and transferable at death to your spouse, if higher than your spouse's own benefits.Q.Can you please review the Social Security policy on earnings once I begin to draw at age 62? Can I opt to draw Social Security any year before age 66? MF, EmeryvilleA.Generally, you can file for retirement benefits from Social Security anytime after you turn age 62. Benefits are at a reduced level if you file before your full retirement age (66 at the moment, rising to 67 for those born in 1960 and later). There are exceptions, mostly related to disability, dependents and widow(er)-hood.
 If you wait until full retirement age or later to file for retirement benefits, then your earned income should not affect your benefit amount. The Social Security Web site is a great resource for details (http://ssa.gov/pubs/10069.html) but here's an overview:
 In the year you reach full retirement age, $1 of benefit is withheld for every $3 of earnings over $37,680 (this amount changes) until you reach full retirement age.
 In the years between age 62 and the year you reach full retirement age, $1 of benefit is withheld for every $2 you earn over $14,160 (this amount changes, too).
 You do not generally '''lose'' these benefits as long as you live long enough. The Social Security Administration recalculates your benefit at full retirement age to make up for the ''withheld'' benefit -- essentially raising your payment by an amount that pays you back over a certain life expectancy. Your benefit may also increase if your earnings in that last year were among your highest years.Q.I was diagnosed with a rare nerve disease in late 2008, after a botched blood draw. I have a hearing this summer, and if I finally receive SSD, I am worried about how to plan for the long term. I am in my mid-40's and suddenly disabled. How would you recommend I plan for the future. Unfortunately, I have no other disability insurance. Thank you kindly for any advice. C.H., CaliforniaA.Thank you for your generosity in sharing your difficult circumstances. You help all of us remember that nothing in life is guaranteed. Your question brings up many planning issues well beyond Social Security benefits.
 I recommend looking for a qualified financial planner to work through your options. Some of the sites to search for a good fit include the National Association of Personal Financial Advisors or the Garrett Planning Network.Q.Those of us still many years from collecting Social Security are understandably bearish about what, if any, benefits we will receive and how high the payroll deduction is likely to go as more baby boomers age.
 I understand you don't have a crystal ball to know which way the political chips will fall, and you can only give your opinion on what the scenario may be. However, do you think the most likely scenario is a cut in benefits, and, if so, what kind of benefit cut do you think a 30-, 40-, or 50-year-old should use for their own planning purposes? Nicole, Alabama
 I'm 26. Will there be Social Security when I'm in my 60s? --D, New York, NYA.You are absolutely right on that cloudy crystal ball! I only speak for myself, but unless someone is reasonably close to retirement (say, over age 50 with 30 years of earning history), I generally do not include Social Security retirement benefits in planning for eventual financial freedom. I also generally ask if someone wants to plan by ''counting on'' Social Security or not -- and see what the plan looks like either way.
 When we have a long time frame to work with, the additional personal savings -- or current and/or future lifestyle trade-offs -- to accomplish personal goals are not as daunting. Save early and often, avoid debt, know what is ''enough'' in your life. Live within your means, be a lifelong learner, and be willing and able to adapt to what life throws at you -- it's just about guaranteed there will be a few surprises.
 My understanding is that there were no Social Security payments before 1940, no regular cost-of-living adjustment before 1975, and at least 10 changes since then. No doubt the details will change but I would argue that there will be something resembling Social Security for decades to come.
 This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Wake-Up Time For a Dream

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA

 BODY:
Sheila Bair, the chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, began her week with a bit of honest heresy, the kind that only she, among all the bank regulators, seems willing to utter in the wake of the financial crisis.
 Deep in a speech she delivered Monday before the Housing Association of Nonprofit Developers -- a speech that got surprisingly little attention -- Ms. Bair listed her three main recommendations to ''put the mortgage industry on a sounder footing.'' The first two were the usual suspects: better consumer education and protection, and a reformed securitization market. Her third proposal, however, was a shocker, taking dead aim at one of the most sacrosanct tenets of American politics: the lofty goal of homeownership. 
 ''For 25 years federal policy has been primarily focused on promoting homeownership and promoting the availability of credit to home buyers,'' Ms. Bair said. She mentioned some of the many subsidies home buyers get, including the home mortgage interest deduction and the ability to deduct property taxes. 
 She tossed in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two ''G.S.E.'s'' (government-sponsored entities) whose role as a guarantor and securitizer of mortgages greatly expanded the ability of mortgage originators to make loans to home buyers -- and which are now, of course, in federal conservatorship, with taxpayers holding the bag for their gargantuan losses. 
 She also pointed out that during the bubble, when anyone with a pulse could get a mortgage, the percentage of Americans owning homes rose to an unprecedented 69 percent, a number that was greeted with bipartisan hurrahs, but which turned out to be ''unsustainable,'' Ms. Bair said.
 She concluded: ''Sustainable homeownership is a worthy national goal. But it should not be pursued to excess when there are other, equally worthy solutions that help meet the needs of people for whom homeownership may not be the right answer.'' Like, you know, renting. 
 The point is: the financial crisis might well have been avoided if we as a culture hadn't invested so much political and psychological capital in the idea of owning a home. After all, the subprime mortgage business's supposed raison d'etre was making homeownership possible for people who lacked the means -- or the credit scores -- to get a traditional mortgage. It's also why bank regulators and politicians were so willing to avert their eyes from the predations and excesses of the subprime companies.
 Yet even now, it is difficult for the body politic to face this truth squarely, so intertwined is homeownership with the American Dream. Which is why Ms. Bair's comments were so heretical. Maybe, she seemed to be suggesting, it's time to break that link, painful though it would be. Maybe she's right.
 The idealization of homeownership by both the public and the federal government is hardly a recent phenomenon, of course. The Federal Housing Authority has been around since 1934. Fannie Mae was founded in 1938. After World War II, the G.I. Bill included modest loans allowing veterans to buy their first homes, according to Michael D. Calhoun, the president of the Center for Responsible Lending. For decades, the savings and loan industry existed solely to make loans to home buyers. In return, the government gave savings and loans certain regulatory advantages over the banks. The mortgage-backed security itself -- which emerged in the 1980s, and made the securitization of mortgages possible -- required the passage of a handful of laws, which Congress happily provided.
 And every president, Democrat and Republican alike, trumpeted the virtues of homeownership for all Americans. Bill Clinton put numerical goals on the percentage increase he wanted to see in homeownership, and greatly increased Fannie and Freddie's affordable housing goals. (Those goals had first been in put in place during the presidency of George H. W. Bush.) George W. Bush trumpeted his ''ownership society''-- and increased those housing goals. Fannie Mae, for its part, explicitly wrapped itself in the American Dream; anyone who opposed Fannie Mae was quickly labeled ''anti-homeownership'' by the company's lobbyists. 
 Indeed, conservatives tend to view the affordable housing goals imposed on Fannie and Freddie as the central reason for the credit crisis. ''In order to increase homeownership, Fannie and Freddie were required to decrease their standards,'' said Peter Wallison, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and perhaps the country's leading critic of the G.S.E.'s. ''We made a big mistake in trying to force housing onto a population that couldn't afford housing.''
 But, to my mind, that view is only half-right. Yes, people got loans who had no hope of paying them back, and that was insane. But Fannie and Freddie's affordable housing goals -- which the G.S.E.'s easily gamed -- were not the main reason. Rather, it was the rise of the subprime lenders -- and their ability to get even their worst loans securitized by Wall Street --that was the main culprit. Fannie and Freddie lowered their standards mostly because they were losing market share to the subprime originators.
 Did government policy make the rise of the subprime lenders possible? You betcha. Over time, the federal government gradually loosened regulations and interest rate caps that allowed the business to first become viable and then to explode. And it completely bought into the idea that the subprime industry was a force for good, because it was expanding homeownership. This, of course, is something the mortgage originators encouraged. Angelo Mozilo, the founder of Countrywide Financial, was as vocal about his company making the American Dream possible as any Fannie Mae lobbyist. 
 But it was a lie. Gary Rivlin, my former colleague at The New York Times, has just published a scathing, important book, ''Broke, USA,'' which includes one shocking anecdote after another of people being conned into taking on mortgages, filled with hidden fees and adjustable rates, that they couldn't possibly afford. The companies that did these things were not the outliers -- they were the bulwarks of the industry: Household, Countrywide, New Century and a raft of others. And when state officials tried to crack down on these unseemly practices, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, instead of investigating, blocked their efforts. After all, homeownership was on the rise!
 Somewhat to my surprise, the housing activists I spoke to -- people who had been in the forefront of trying to stop the subprime lenders -- generally didn't agree that homeownership should be de-emphasized. ''Let's not throw out the baby with the bathwater,'' said John Taylor, the chief executive of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition. ''I think owning a home is the most common way for working-class people to join the middle class.'' Mainly, he said, that was because of a home's appreciation, which gave people the opportunity for wealth creation that would otherwise have remained out of reach. Others mentioned additional societal benefits of homeownership, like stable neighborhoods. And homeowners had every incentive to keep their homes up, precisely because of the equity in their homes. 
 The academics I spoke to, however, were not so convinced that homeownership offered benefits to society that were so important they demanded federal subsidies. Especially since those subsidies were so huge, and so distorting to the economy. For instance, in 2009, according to the Congressional Budget Office, government subsidies for housing amounted to a staggering $230 billion.
 ''You hear all this rhetoric about stability caused by homeownership,'' said Richard Florida, the author of ''The Great Reset,'' and a professor at the University of Toronto. ''But the communities that survived the housing bubble the best were the ones that had the highest percentage of renters.''
 Edward Glaeser, a professor at Harvard and a contributor to The Times's Economix blog, said that if homeownership had to be encouraged -- which he was not at all convinced of -- it should be through a ''flat homeowners' tax credit'' rather than a home mortgage deduction that essentially ''bribes people to buy bigger houses.'' What he says he really believes, though, is that renters offer plenty of social good themselves, helping creating vibrant cities. ''The idea that homeownership is always great and renting is un-American is an awful state of affairs,'' he said.
 Obviously, the country is too psychologically invested in the idea of homeownership to ever abandon completely the homeownership ideal, or to put renting on a equal footing with owning. Which is why I found the most appealing idea to be Mr. Rivlin's. 
 Despite having spent the last two years of his life reporting on the destruction wrought, in part, by the government's unthinking push for ever more homeownership, he still wasn't willing to abandon it completely. Rather, he thought the big policy mistake we had made as a culture was in promoting policies that encourage all home purchases, under any circumstance. ''Why should the government help me buy a second home? Why should it subsidize a refinancing?'' he asked. (I was amazed to discover that, if you qualify, you can actually get an F.H.A. loan for a refinancing.) ''We have missed the essential piece,'' he added. ''The social good is in helping qualified first-time buyers own a home. That should be our goal. After that, people should be on their own.''
 Right now, more than two years after the fall of Bear Stearns, which represented the beginning of the financial crisis, the federal government is more involved in the mortgage industry than it has ever been in its history. As wards of the state, Fannie and Freddie are insuring three out of every four mortgages. Most of the remaining 25 percent are being guaranteed by the F.H.A. As much as you might resent the fact that the taxpayers now have to pick up behind new Fannie and Freddie, the sad truth is that without them, no one in America would be able to buy a home. 
 Surely, that's the logical culmination of decades of government policy promoting homeownership. Eventually, of course, the private market will return to the mortgage business, though it is hard to know when. Fannie and Freddie will be reconfigured in some way. But unless we change the way we think as a society about the virtues of homeownership, the fundamental fact will remain: the government will always be the backstop for the mortgage business, with the taxpayers always liable for the losses. 
 Is that really what we want?

HEADLINE: Retail Sales Fall, Deflating Some Optimism

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL

 BODY:
Sales at retailers unexpectedly fell in May, raising some questions about how much consumers will be able to continue contributing to an economic recovery.
 According to a Census Bureau report released on Friday, retail sales declined in May for the first time since last fall, mostly because of a sharp plunge in purchases of building materials. 
 ''What's going to happen is a reassessment of the underlying momentum of the economy,'' said Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics. ''If the monthly numbers don't improve in coming months, we can probably expect the third-quarter growth number to look very shaky.'' 
 The decline came even as a private survey showed that consumer confidence was increasing. The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary index of consumer sentiment rose to 75.5 in June, from 73.6 in May. 
 Retail sales fell at a seasonally adjusted rate of 1.2 percent last month after growing 0.6 percent in April. The overall number was much lower than forecasters had expected. 
 Not including sales at building supplies outlets, auto dealers and gasoline stations -- three of the most volatile categories -- retail sales rose 0.1 percent.
 The biggest decline was in building materials, gardening equipment and supplies dealers, whose sales fell a larger-than-expected 9.3 percent over the previous month. 
 Economists have attributed the decline to a possible winding down of incentives like tax rebates to buy energy-efficient appliances. Sales by building material suppliers had surged more than 8 percent in each of the previous two months.
 ''Basically when the incentive was there, people bought,'' said Nigel Gault, chief United States economist at IHS Global Insight. ''When the incentive dries up because funds run out, people pull back again. And frankly the correction in building materials probably has further to go.''
 Purchases of building materials may have also been relatively high in March and April because people were completing repairs on their houses after an unusually stormy winter, Mr. Shepherdson said.
 The winding down of incentives to buy energy-efficient appliances might also partly explain the decline in sales at department stores, which sell goods like air-conditioners and kitchen appliances. Purchases at department stores fell 1.8 percent in May after declining by the same percentage in April. 
 Gasoline station purchases also helped drive the overall decline in spending. Gas stations' sales fell 3.3 percent in May, a decline that can be largely explained by a fall in gas prices. The Census's monthly retail sales report does not adjust for inflation.
 Motor vehicle and parts dealers' sales, an especially volatile category, declined by 1.7 percent in May, and had grown by 0.6 percent the previous month. On a year-over-year basis, sales from motor vehicle and parts dealers are up 11.2 percent.
 One bright spot was sales from nonstore retailers, a category that includes online purchases. These sales rose a healthy 2 percent in May, and were up 15.6 percent from the same period the previous year. 
 There were also modest gains in sales by furniture stores, grocery stores and health and personal care stores, among others. Sales at clothing stores, however, declined by 1.3 percent in April, after a decline of 0.7 percent in April.
 Economists hope that the late Memorial Day holiday and unfavorable May weather may have pushed some holiday-related spending into June. Still, several prominent forecasters have slightly lowered their expectations for the second-quarter gross domestic product, in part because the May retail sales report and a similarly disappointing May jobs report do not bode well for strong consumer spending this quarter. 
 The gross domestic product grew 3 percent in the first quarter of this year, largely on the back of strong consumer spending growth. Consumer spending represents about 70 percent of the nation's final output.
 In a separate report released Friday, the Census Bureau said that total business sales in April rose 0.6 percent on a seasonally-adjusted basis. Inventories rose 0.4 percent the same month.

HEADLINE: Japan's Prime Minister Warns That Debt Could Bring a Crisis Like That of Greece

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

 BODY:
TOKYO -- Japan's newly installed prime minister startled the nation on Friday by warning that it could face a financial crisis of Greek proportions if it does not tackle its colossal debt.
 The stark words from the prime minister, Naoto Kan, followed by just hours the resignation of his banking minister and ally in the governing Democratic Party, Shizuka Kamei -- an advocate of big spending. Mr. Kamei's departure seemed to signal that the new government would focus on reducing Japan's heavy government debt, called sovereign debt, by far the highest in the industrialized world, and cutting back on the wasteful public works projects. 
 ''It is difficult to sustain a policy that relies too heavily on issuing debt,'' Mr. Kan told the Japanese Parliament in his first policy speech. ''As we have seen with the financial confusion in the European Community stemming from Greece, our finances could collapse if trust in national bonds is lost and growing national debt is left alone.'' 
 Worried by the Greek debt crisis, policy makers around the world have increasingly raised the alarm over runaway government spending of the past two years, as the world has grappled with an economic crisis.
 This week, Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, warned that the United States budget appeared to be on ''an unsustainable path,'' while also recognizing that an ''exceptional increase'' in the deficit had been necessary to ease the pain of recession. New prime ministers in both Britain and Hungary warned last week that their nations' budget problems were more severe than their predecessors had let on.
 Japan's public debt, at $9.7 trillion, was close to twice its gross domestic product in 2009. But in contrast to Greece, most of that is held domestically, putting Japan, the world's second largest economy after the United States, on a better financial footing.
 Still, some analysts have warned that Japan's graying population may begin to retire and cash in their bonds, forcing the government to look abroad for financing. In January, the ratings agency Standard & Poor's cut its outlook for Japan's sovereign debt rating, saying that the government appeared to have no plan to start containing debt.
 The statements Friday from Mr. Kan appeared to press for an agenda he calls the ''Third Way'' for the country's economy. This would avoid the mistakes of previous governments, he has said, by limiting the enormous investment in public works that propped up the economy in the 1990s, while also stepping back from the deregulation Japan dabbled with over the last decade.
 Instead, he envisions raising taxes and investing heavily in new fields like health and the environment, a move he says will create jobs, raise incomes and bring about economic growth.
 In his speech, Mr. Kan called for a bipartisan debate on raising the 5 percent sales tax in Japan to help pay for soaring social welfare costs brought on by the country's aging society.
 ''The stagnation we are experiencing now is due in great part to a struggling economy, burgeoning budget deficit and a breakdown of trust in social welfare,'' he said. ''Instead, the new government will build a strong economy, strong public finances and a strong social welfare system.''
 Mr. Kan's new national strategy minister, Satoshi Arai, said Friday that the government would draft a mid- to long-term plan by June 22 to address Japan's debt. The government would seek to cap bond issuance below $500 billion in the fiscal year ending in March 2012.
 How aggressively Mr. Kan can pursue any agenda will depend on the outcome of nationwide elections for Parliament's upper house on July 11. Support for the Democrats, which slumped under the previous prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama, has rebounded under the new leadership.
 Mr. Kan's prospects may be buoyed further by the departure of Mr. Kamei, the banking minister and vocal head of a tiny coalition partner that has often undermined the Democrats by straying from the government line. Shozaburo Jimi, a lawmaker from Mr. Kamei's People's New Party, was named the new banking minister.

HEADLINE: South Carolina Votes First, Asks Questions (Who's Alvin Greene?) Later

BYLINE: By MARK LEIBOVICH; Robbie Brown contributed reporting from Manning, S.C.

 BODY:
 WASHINGTON -- For a few hours this week, it looked as if South Carolina might ditch its never-fail reputation for political scandal in favor of a genuine history-making event. 
 There was Nikki Haley, a lawmaker of Indian descent, beaming on election night with her husband and children after taking a major step toward becoming the first female governor of the state. It was a feel-good image to obscure the stain of a campaign marked by ethnic slurs, accusations of marital infidelity and yet more national marveling over how a single state can produce a string of political embarrassments as long as the Appalachian Trail.
 But then, the television cameras started rolling on Alvin Greene's overgrown lawn. 
 ''Yeah, it's been pretty nonstop for a few days,'' said Mr. Greene, 32, in a phone interview Friday. 
 Because everyone wants to know how Mr. Greene, an unemployed Army veteran who had been completely unknown until Tuesday, inexplicably defeated a heavily favored former legislator and judge to become the state's Democratic nominee for the Senate -- and the state's latest political circus act. 
 Mr. Greene had just a few peaceful hours to savor his victory in the tiny, ramshackle home he shares with his elderly father along a quiet highway in Manning, where he has been bunkered since election night. Then, The Associated Press reported that Mr. Greene was arrested in November and is facing a felony obscenity charge; he is accused of showing pornography to a University of South Carolina student. He had been discharged ''involuntarily'' from the Army and showed no signs of having waged an actual campaign in recent months -- no advertising, no staff, no money. 
 Mr. Greene, who declined to comment on the obscenity charge, would not say how he came up with the $10,440 to register his candidacy. Representative James E. Clyburn, Democrat of South Carolina and the House majority whip, suggested that Mr. Greene was a ''Republican plant'' and that the circumstance reeked of the ''shenanigans'' that have become the state's trademark.
 ''We have embarrassment fatigue here,'' said Dick Harpootlian, the former Democratic chairman of the state. ''If there is an embarrassment equivalent of post-traumatic stress disorder, South Carolina has it.''
 Even casual observers across the country can recite the recent litany of Palmetto State political antics. The Republican donnybrook between John McCain and George W. Bush in 2000 left more scars than any presidential primary campaign in recent memory. Gov. Mark Sanford's public swoon over an Argentinean mistress -- an affair he carried on while claiming to have been hiking the Appalachian Trail -- remains a spigot of late-night punch lines (while Mr. Sanford remains the state's governor). 
 The Republican primary campaign to succeed Mr. Sanford featured two operatives claiming to have had extramarital affairs with Ms. Haley (who strenuously denied the accusations) as well as a Republican state senator dismissing her with an ethnic slur.
 Now comes Mr. Greene, adding Democratic balance to the state's Republican-dominated scandal sheets of recent vintage. Mr. Clyburn immediately called for someone to investigate Mr. Greene's candidacy -- who paid for the campaign, who was behind it, how did he ever win? 
 Mr. Harpootlian, a former district attorney, wants to know why Mr. Greene had not filed any papers with the Federal Election Commission, and Don Fowler, a former Democratic National Committee chairman from South Carolina, said he suspected that someone tampered with the voting machines. 
 ''There is something genuinely mysterious about this whole thing,'' said Mr. Fowler, whose wife, Carol, the current chairwoman of the state's Democratic Party, has called for Mr. Greene to step aside. 
 Mr. Greene said he had no intention of doing so. He said the whole gambit has been his idea, that he paid the entry fee and that his was -- and remains -- ''a self-managed campaign.'' He said he would challenge his Republican opponent, Senator Jim DeMint, to a debate in September. ''It will be one hour. Live. On a major network,'' he proposed.
 Mr. Greene said he was determined to go through with this, which would seem to belie the somewhat shell-shocked demeanor he has projected in several interviews over the last 72 hours. ''Can I end this?'' Mr. Greene asked in the middle of a brief interview with a local television station in front of his house Wednesday. It might as well be his campaign's official motto, or wish, at least as far as leading Democrats are concerned. 
 ''Sad,'' Mr. Clyburn said, referring to the spectacle that Mr. Greene has become on the cable and YouTube circuits.
 Even in Manning, a town of 4,000 where everybody knows everybody, nobody seems to know Alvin Greene. ''He just all of a sudden shows up and -- boom!'' said L. G. Mathis, 61, the owner of L. G.'s Cut and Style, a barber shop downtown.
 It is another embarrassment for South Carolina, said Carl F. Jackson Jr, a graphic designer at a local newspaper, The Clarendon Citizen. ''Anybody who got beyond eighth grade is a little astounded by this,'' Mr. Jackson said, adding his own theory of how Mr. Greene had won. ''Maybe voters thought it was the singer, Al Green.''
 When asked in a phone interview Friday whether he was having ''fun,'' Mr. Greene quickly answered yes, before asking for clarification. 
 ''What do you mean by fun?''
 Without waiting for an answer, Mr. Greene said he was not interested in ''fun,'' or signing autographs (which he has yet to do) or indulging any of the trappings of his unlikely celebrity. He is interested in sticking to the issues that are important -- jobs, education, justice -- and to conveying why he is ''the best candidate for the United States Senate in South Carolina.'' 
 Before elaborating on why he was, Mr. Greene excused himself, saying that he had to finish another interview.

HEADLINE: Driving Past the BP Station, and Tilting at Windmills

BYLINE: By RON LIEBER

 BODY:
With each day that oil fouls the Gulf of Mexico, more drivers are weighing a choice at intersections across the United States: if BP is on the left and some other station is on the right, is filling up at BP an endorsement of the company's conduct?
 Advocacy organizations like Public Citizenurge consumers to stay away from BP stations. About 550,000 Facebook users have clicked the ''Like'' button on the Boycott BP page. And angry people have picketed at BP stations.
 This doesn't send a particularly powerful message to BP, though. After all, BP owns only a handful of the 11,000 stations that bear its brand and is trying to sell the few still on its books. So those who wish to inflict the maximum amount of pain on the company are instead putting much of the hurt on the family businesses that actually own the stations. 
 Just how little does BP gain from its gas stations, besides whatever ancillary marketing benefit it gains from the signs? The gas in its pumps may not be extracted, refined or stored by the company and may just get a spritz of BP additives right before it ends up at the service station. All of this puts a mere handful of coins in the company's pocket per fill-up.
 And the gas that people buy when they fill up elsewhere? Fuel from independent gas stations, grocery chains and big-box wholesale clubs sometimes comes directly from refineries or wholesalers that BP owns outright.
 Greenpeace has chosen not to call for a boycott. Instead, its representatives pose a different challenge: people who really want to punish BP ought to try getting Beyond Petroleum themselves.
 BP doesn't have much use for the service station business anymore. In 2007, it announced plans to sell the last 700 stations that it hadn't already sold to franchisees. The company chose to focus on finding and collecting oil.
 Once companies make a discovery, it comes out of the ground and ends up at a refinery. There, it can be mixed with oil that a variety of companies have poured into the tanks. 
 Then, the gasoline makes at least one stop at what is essentially a wholesale warehouse. BP owns some of these tank farms, but so do other companies.
 Eventually, a truck pulls up to collect and deliver the gasoline to stations. It is often only then that the ingredients that make it BP fuel get added. ''It doesn't become a brand of gasoline until it gets those additives,'' said Brandon Wright, a spokesman for the Petroleum Marketers Association of America. 
 ''What BP gets from this is probably a rounding error in terms of overall revenues or profits,'' said Jeff Lenard, a spokesman for NACS, an association of convenience stores and gasoline retailers. 
 Meanwhile, revenue for some BP station owners has declined as much as 20 percent since the oil spill, according John Kleine, executive director of the BP Amoco Marketers Association, which represents many of the owners and suppliers of the BP and Arco stations.
 And does Public Citizen truly believe that the spill's environmental damage and the resulting economic pain justify its attempts to starve service station owners of revenue? ''We're clearly not helping them, but I don't think we're hurting them,'' said Tyson Slocum, director of the organization's energy project, who added that its boycott would last only three months. ''I'm not saying two wrongs make a right, but we felt that there would be minimal collateral damage by initiating a national boycott.''
 For people who can't stomach the idea of even a penny of their money going to BP, driving by the station in search of a more palatable option creates its own problems. Kert Davies, the research director for Greenpeace in the United States, said he was pondering this recently as he was driving home (yes, he does drive). ''There was a Chevron, a Shell station, Exxon and BP,'' he said. ''I can think of really good reasons to boycott every one of those.''
 Plenty of people head to a no-name station, a grocer or warehouse club. But it's entirely possible that those drivers end up with a tank full of the very fuel that they were trying to avoid. ''Pick any one of those retailers, and you stand a good chance of filling your car up with fuel extracted by BP,'' Mr. Lenard said.
 Alternatively, BP may have stored the gasoline and supplied it to whomever delivered it to a grocer or warehouse store. David Nicholas, a BP spokesman, said that he could not identify BP's biggest wholesale fuel customers, but that he probably wouldn't disclose them even if he could. ''I think we would treat that as a commercial agreement that we would not discuss,'' he said.
 Meghan Glynn, a spokeswoman for the grocery chain Kroger, which sells a lot of gasoline, said the identity of its partners was proprietary. ''We source fuel as a commodity from a variety of suppliers,'' she said in a statement. And if one of them happened to be BP, how would the company feel about protestors picketing its fuel pumps? ''We respect the right of individuals to advocate for their point of view, but we leave purchasing decisions up to the individual consumer,'' she wrote.
 Jeff Cole, who runs Costco's enormous gasoline sales operation, did not return several calls for comment about whether it purchases fuel from BP. Sam's Club, meanwhile, offers gas at 464 locations, some of which comes from BP terminals. 
 BJ's Wholesale Club does not buy gasoline directly from BP, but a spokeswoman, Kelly McFalls, said that didn't mean it wasn't peddling BP's fuel. ''There is not a single retailer out there that can guarantee that the gas it's offering isn't mixed with some BP gas,'' she said. ''That's just the way the fuel business works.''
 These uncomfortable truths are a big part of why Greenpeace has not called for a boycott. Still, it hopes to use the spill as a rallying cry. ''We would like people to think about this as something bigger than BP,'' Mr. Davies said. ''All of these companies have us literally over a barrel. They are the dealer, and we are the addict.''
 So perhaps the best way for people to express outrage and inflict pain on oil companies is to use less fuel, thereby lowering overall demand. This is much harder than flinging brown paint at a BP sign, as many people have done. It may mean walking more or wearing sweaters indoors in the winter with the thermostat set at 64 degrees.
 People who still need a short-term hit of righteousness may continue to avoid filling up at BP stations. But it would be nice if they picked up a week's worth of milk from a BP mini-mart on the way home at night. That way, the station owners don't suffer as much.
 Then, the next morning, all of those drivers ought to go shopping for a hybrid.

HEADLINE: An Up-and-Down Week Concludes on a Positive Note

BYLINE: By SUSANNA G. KIM

 BODY:
Stocks ended a roller-coaster week with a gain on Friday, as the technology sector responded to strong results from the chip maker National Semiconductor, while a positive report on consumer confidence offset a decline in retail sales.
 Wall Street indexes fell initially after the Commerce Department reported that retail sales decreased 1.2 percent last month, the largest drop since the fall. Five of the 13 retail categories fell, led by a 9.3 percent decline in building materials, the department said.
 The report was tempered by a University of Michigan survey showing a jump in June in the consumer sentiment index, a measure of confidence, and another report from the Commerce Department that said business inventories in April rose 0.4 percent after an upwardly revised 0.7 percent gain in March. 
 ''Even though inventories have been growing, they need to continue to grow,'' Alan D. Levenson, chief economist of T. Rowe Price, said. ''They've been falling relative to sales for more than a year, so production rates will have to increase further in order to bring inventories up relative to rising sales.'' 
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 38.54 points, or 0.38 percent, to 10,211.07, and the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 4.76 points, or 0.44 percent, to 1,091.60. The Nasdaq was up 24.89 points, or 1.12 percent, at 2,243.60.
 The Dow industrials and the S.& P. 500 finished the week with gains of about 3 percent, while the Nasdaq rose about 1 percent. 
 Bruce E. McCain, chief investment strategist with Key Private Bank, attributed some of the continuing strength in technology shares to Wednesday's positive export data from China. 
 ''The extent to which a lot of the tech companies get sales overseas, many investors believed China is not as bad as it had seemed,'' said Mr. McCain. ''That suggests better sales for tech companies.'' 
 The sector was helped by Thursday's earnings report from National Semiconductor, which posted a fourth-quarter profit and forecast a better first quarter than analysts had expected. 
 National Semiconductor rose 5.03 percent.
 Microsoft rose 2.64 percent, Oracle 2.18 percent and Apple 1.19 percent. 
 Mr. McCain said that despite the negative retail sales numbers, the bounce in technology shares was a sign that prices might be reaching a bottom, because the technology sector was sensitive to the economy. 
 While the retail sales numbers left analysts trying to determine if consumers were starting to trim their spending, Mr. Levenson said May's numbers were not a sign of a double-dip recession.
 ''We had big increases in core retail sales in the beginning of this year,'' Mr. Levenson said. 
 ''Right now we're seeing a more cautious time of spending supported by growing incomes,'' he said, adding that consumers had been saving more while also trying to pay off their debts.
 Both personal income and savings have been stronger in recent months -- income rose 0.4 percent in April, while the rate of savings rose to 3.6 percent in April, from 3.1 percent in March. 
 Prices rose in the Treasury markets, a move Mr. Levenson attributed to the investors who were seeking some safety in light of the weak retail sales report. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 23/32, to 102 7/32, and the yield fell to 3.23 percent from 3.32 percent late Thursday.
 Shares closed higher in major Asian markets but were mixed in Europe. 
 In London, shares of the oil giant BP closed up 7.7 percent one day after they fell on speculation that the company would be forced to cut its dividend to help pay for the cleanup of the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. 
 The FTSE 100 closed up 0.6 percent at 5,163.68; the DAX in Frankfurt lost 0.1 percent to 6,047.83; and the CAC-40 in Paris rose 1.1 percent to 3,555.52. 
 In Tokyo, the benchmark Nikkei 225 gained 162.60 points, or 1.7 percent, to 9,705.25.
 The euro slipped to $1.2077 from $1.2095.
 Benchmark crude for July delivery was down $1.70, closing at $73.78 a barrel in New York trading.

HEADLINE: Craft Shop Family Buys Up Ancient Bibles for Museum

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT

 BODY:
OKLAHOMA CITY -- At least one example of the printed word is in great demand even in the digital age: ancient Bibles.
 With a goal of establishing a national Bible museum of great depth and size, the evangelical Christian family behind the Hobby Lobby chain of craft stores has been spending heavily to amass a collection that has set dealers buzzing in the staid world of rare books.
 Specialists estimate the family has bought illuminated, or decorated, manuscripts, Torahs, papyri and other works worth $20 million to $40 million from auction houses, dealers, private collectors and institutions, some of which may be selling because of financial pressure. 
 The man leading the effort is Steve Green, president of Hobby Lobby, a private company based here that is a favorite of scrapbook makers, do-it-yourselfers and home decorators. The company, founded by his father, David, in 1972, now numbers 439 stores and has generated a family fortune that Forbes magazine estimates at $2.5 billion. 
 With money to spare, the younger Mr. Green, 46, has found a passion to complement his vocation, and is working with specialists in deal-making and history who, using company money on behalf of the family, began buying with a flourish about six months ago. 
 ''They have caught everyone's attention because no one in recent memory has spent so much so quickly on Bibles,'' said Dr. Eric White, curator of special collections at the Bridwell Library at Southern Methodist University in Dallas. 
 The collection now includes more than 30,000 items, according to Mr. Green and his team. Some of those were shown to The New York Times at Hobby Lobby offices in Oklahoma City, including a New Testament papyrus from the second century A.D., a lavishly illustrated and illuminated Martin Luther New Testament and a Spanish Inquisition Torah. 
 ''The goal is to create a museum around the story of the Bible,'' Mr. Green explained. ''No book has been persecuted as much or loved as much. Its incredible story needs to be told.'' 
 Mr. Green is Pentecostal, but other family members worship in churches of other denominations, including Baptist and Assemblies of God. The family gives to a variety of Christian causes, Oral Roberts University and evangelical ministries among them, and adheres to Christian principles, closing its stores on Sundays, playing Christian music in them and operating Mardel, a separate chain of religious bookstores. 
 With sales last year of just over $2 billion the company has no long-term debt, Mr. Green said over a lunch of sandwiches that began with a prayer at the company's nondescript, sprawling corporate headquarters. Despite the recession, profits rose in 2009, he said, perhaps because people spent more time at home.
 For the Green family, the time seems ideal for buying religious works.
 As Sam Fogg, a London dealer of rare manuscripts, put it, ''Between 1988 and 1993, the Bible market rocketed,'' and then it languished even as the broader art market rose. 
 In addition, ''Libraries are rethinking their mission in the age of digitization,'' said David N. Redden, executive vice president at Sotheby's books department. ''They are wondering what their holdings should be: whether they are about collecting rare books or disseminating information. If the latter, do they need rare books? In some ways, it is not a bad time to be buying.''
 The Green collection aims to be one of a kind. Other Bible collections in the United States, including one at the American Bible Society in Manhattan, generally intend to inspire readership, said Dr. Scott Carroll, who began advising Mr. Green about six months ago. ''Our goal is to inspire people with the story of the Bible and its history.''
 Dr. Carroll, a former professor in ancient studies who has specialized in Biblical manuscripts, recently resigned from Cornerstone University, a nondenominational Christ-based liberal arts school in Grand Rapids, Mich., to become executive director of the museum and an adviser to Mr. Green. In the 1990s, Dr. Carroll helped another collector, Robert Van Kampen, build the private Van Kampen Collection of Bibles and related material in Orlando, Fla., and helped oversee its academic objectives, including archaeological digs.
 Some who are knowledgeable about the rare book market suggest that the group's buying has pushed up prices. The buying has also spawned some skepticism about the overall quality of purchases made in such rapid-fire style. Among the 30 objects that the Green group offered for examination recently were a silver amulet from the first or second century inscribed with a passage from Deuteronomy, also known as the Shema; the Codex Climaci Rescriptus, a manuscript originated from the Monastery of Mt. St. Catherine that was home to the earliest near-complete copy of the Bible, and the first volume of a Complutensian Polyglot Bible that was used for the comparative study of the text of Scripture. It contains the first printing of the Septuagint, or Old Testament Scriptures in Greek. 
 ''Compared to objects in the fine art market, they are not hugely expensive, but in the rare book field, they are big time, and these people appear to be spending a lot of money,'' said Stephen Massey, an appraiser experienced in ancient religious objects. Though Mr. Massey had not seen the collection, he reviewed a list of the objects that were displayed. 
 Westminster College at Cambridge put the Codex Climaci Rescriptus up for auction at Sotheby's last year. ''It is not widely used at the school, and the money will help open up the resources of the school to a broader constituency,'' said Susan Durber, the principal of Westminster. 
 The estimated auction price was $1 million. When the manuscript did not sell, the Green group bought it directly from Sotheby's, for an unspecified price. 
 The group also bought a Martin Luther New Testament with 44 lushly hand-painted and illuminated woodcuts, suggesting that the edition was made for royal use, perhaps for Luther's protector, Frederick the Wise.
 The book was sold by Jorn Gunther, a dealer who had listed the edition at $400,000 in his catalog. ''Book dealers are bibliophiles, but these men are coming at it with a strong belief that the Bible is the word of God and they want to show that,'' said Mr. Gunther of Stalden, Switzerland. ''It is like a doctor buying medical books.'' 
 Collecting work from the Old Testament and the New Testament has taken the buyers into Judaica. ''We have over 1,000 Torahs,'' said John Shipman, a venture capitalist who is the third member of the Green buying team. Mr. Shipman, whose father was an ordained minister as are his brother and brother-in-law, said he met Mr. Green, through Mart Green, his brother, about seven years ago, when Mart, the founder and chief executive of EthnoGraphic Media, was producing ''End of the Spear,'' a film about missionaries killed in Ecuador. 
 ''John talked about collecting Bibles,'' Steven Green said. ''My brother had talked about a Bible museum. That was how it started.'' Mr. Shipman brought in Dr. Carroll at the end of last year. ''He has the academic knowledge, and I negotiate the purchases,'' Mr. Shipman said. He added that several other families were also collecting with the goal of giving to the museum. 
 Because the Bible museum has not completed the paperwork to become a not-for-profit organization, the salaries of Mr. Shipman and Dr. Carroll are not yet public, and Mr. Green declined to reveal them. The plans for the museum are quite ambitious. Dr. Carroll said the three were looking for 300,000 square feet of space and hoped to attract more than a million visitors a year. 
 Dallas is the first choice to house the collection, Mr. Green said, because of the large number of people of faith in the area. He also said that the many seminaries and universities in Dallas would welcome such a museum and it would benefit from their resources.
 An offer on a former Macy's store in a mall was rejected, but Mr. Green is continuing to look for a large property while temporarily storing his trove of treasures at the company's warehouses.

HEADLINE: Those Earth-Friendly Products? Turns Out They're Profit-Friendly as Well

BYLINE: By SINDYA N. BHANOO

 BODY:
As the world's greatest soccer players take to the fields at the FIFA World Cup in South Africa, many are wearing jerseys made almost entirely from plastic bottles rescued from landfills in Japan and Taiwan.
 It is, if nothing else, good publicity for Nike, the maker of the jerseys and the official sponsor of nine teams, including the United States, Brazil and Portugal. 
 Yet what many might view as a gimmick is also part of a broadening effort by the company to incorporate sustainability, or environmentally responsible practices, into its product design. Around the globe, a growing number of manufacturers are including more recyclable or biodegradable components into products. 
 Companies making changes run the gamut -- there are furniture makers, carpet manufacturers, clothing retailers and makers of shampoos and household cleaners. And with big-box retailers like Wal-Mart joining in, industry analysts say the sustainable philosophy is no longer viewed as the province of high-end sellers like Nike or Herman Miller, the furniture maker. 
 In 2008 alone, American consumers doubled their spending on sustainable products and services to an estimated $500 billion, according to a survey that polled more than a 1,000 people by Penn Schoen Berland Associates, a market research firm that studies the green economy.
 The movement can be confusing to navigate and goes by many monikers -- ''cradle to cradle,'' eco-efficiency, life cycle improvement, closed-loop production. In its most utopian form, it envisions a world in which all products are made from natural materials and are 100 percent reusable, recyclable or biodegradable, never ending up in landfill.
 At its most pragmatic, it is mainly about cutting costs -- by reducing waste, selling recyclable components and reusing byproducts like rubber or plastic to create a new product. For a large company, this can mean millions of dollars in annual savings. 
 ''When sustainability burst onto the scene, it was in the responsibility category, something that a company should do because it was the right thing to do,'' said Beth Lester, a vice president at Penn Schoen Berland Associates. But now it is equally about saving money, she said. 
 For example, Wal-Mart attributed more than $100 million of its 2009 revenue to a decision to switch to a recyclable variety of cardboard in shipments to its 4,300-plus stories in the United States. Now it sells the cardboard to a recycler rather than paying to ship the waste to a landfill.
 The company also sells photo frames made from its polystyrene waste and recycles plastic scraps leftover from producing Wal-Mart-brand diapers into material used in building new Wal-Mart stores.
 ''It's coming from economics,'' said Marc Stoiber, vice president for green innovation at the Chicago-based business consultancy Maddock Douglas. ''If you look at the big guys like Wal-Mart, they embrace green because it's all about efficiency.''
 Matt Kistler, the senior vice president of sustainability at Wal-Mart, agreed. ''If this was not financially viable, a company such as ours would not be doing it,'' he said.
 In its most ambitious project, Wal-Mart, after surveying more than 100,000 suppliers worldwide, has embarked on a yearlong effort to tag every product it sells with information about its production and life cycle. 
 Nike first dipped its toe into sustainability in 1993, when it began grinding up old shoes and donating the material and other manufacturing scraps to builders of sports surfaces, like tracks and basketball courts. That program continues, but the company has shifted gradually from one-of-a-kind initiatives to a long-term plan to ''minimize or eliminate all substances known to be harmful to the health of biological or ecological systems.'' 
 In the last four years, the company's sustainable design group, known as Nike Considered Design, has brought shoes and athletic clothing to market that incorporate waste from the factory floor and a less toxic type of rubber. Some of Nike's clothing incorporates zippers and cords made from old shoes. 
 The company has also reduced its use of solvents, the toxic glue used to cement soles to the bottom of shoes. 
 ''Our customers expect this from us,'' said Lorrie Vogel, general manager of Nike's Considered group. ''It's not about two or three green shoes -- it's about changing the way our company does things in general.''
 As companies move to reduce waste and analyze the components of their products, many are turning to outside consultants for help. Among the most prominent is William McDonough, co-author of a 2002 book called ''Cradle to Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things.''
 He runs a consultancy that evaluates companies' policies in areas like toxicity, renewable energy, water stewardship and sustainability and awards corporations Cradle to Cradle Certification if they make the necessary changes. 
 His firm, McDonough Braungart Design Chemistry, has worked with Nike, Herman Miller and Shaw, the world's largest carpet maker. Herman Miller says that 50 percent of its revenue now comes from products that are Cradle to Cradle-compliant, and it is aiming for 100 percent. 
 Shaw has collected 300 million pounds of used carpet in the last three years and reused 85 percent of it. 
 ''I've never met one C.E.O. who said 'Give me a toxic product,' '' Mr. McDonough said. ''But they need business models that are effective for them.''
 Still, companies can be reluctant to make trade-offs when performance or aesthetics suffers.
 Method, a maker of household cleaning products, shuns chemicals like ammonia, bleach and phthalates and maintains a list of earth-friendly ones. But when it came to the design of its bottles, the company stood firm, declining to reduce the plastic content beyond a certain point because it believed that it would make them less visually attractive, according to a recent report in The McKinsey Quarterly, an online business management journal.
 Companies may also have to weigh a product's toxicity level against its longevity. The retailer Patagonia is viewed as environmentally conscious -- 75 percent of the clothing it sells is recyclable -- but it has had difficulty finding nontoxic dyes. For now, Patagonia prefers to stick with colorfast dyes, although not all are harmless to the earth.
 ''It's super-easy to find an environmentally friendly dye that will fade in three washes,'' said Jenn Rapp, a spokeswoman. ''But a garment that lasts 20 years is much more friendly than one that lasts five months.''
 Even champions of sustainability say that consumers should be wary of giving companies too much credit or accepting all of their claims. Makers of cleaning agents in particular may offer an expensive ''green line'' of offerings but leave the rest of their products untouched, some say.
 ''I think the cradle-to-cradle concept is great,'' said Wood Turner, executive director of Climate Counts, a nonprofit group that scores manufacturers of consumer products makers on their track records. ''The problem is that most companies are not as inclined to push that into all their products and all their brands.
 ''I have to ask, is this really just an example of green tokenism, or does it reflect deep thinking on a company's part?''

Credit unions have a reputation for being rather dull and conservative, and for decades, America's First Federal Credit Union in Birmingham, Ala., was no exception.
 But earlier this year, as public outrage at big banks boiled over, First Federal introduced a new and unusually biting marketing plan. In a series of commercials shown repeatedly on local television, actors posing as bankers walk into a sidewalk confessional and admit their many sins.
 ''We charge a lot of fees for nothing,'' one ''banker'' admits. ''I feel a little bad about that. How do I sleep at night? Did I mention that my bonus check had two commas in it?''
 Now might seem a perfect moment for credit unions to shout from the rooftops about what makes them different from for-profit banks. For starters, most credit unions did not engage in the type of risky lending that led to the crisis. 
 Generally, credit unions also did not charge the kind of sky-high interest rates on credit cards and exorbitant overdraft fees that fueled anger at their bigger competitors.
 Yet, despite growing antipathy toward big banks, most credit unions have stuck to their time-worn routines: gentle membership drives, bland advertising and contentment with the business they have. That slow approach makes the recent wave of cheeky, take-that advertisements from a handful of credit unions stand out all the more.
 Membership in credit unions grew a ho-hum 1.4 percent in 2009 and 1.6 percent the year before. Savings did rise by 10.3 percent in 2009, while loans increased by 1.2 percent. 
 Banks do not publicly report how many new accounts they add or subtract, and it is difficult to make an exact comparison with credit unions. However, federal records show that domestic deposits at banks insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation grew 2 percent in the first quarter of 2010, compared with the same period last year, while total loans declined 3 percent.
 Of course, membership in a credit union is no guarantee of better service or financial stability. At the beginning of 2009, there were 7,965 credit unions. That year 28 credit unions failed, and 15 more have closed so far this year. (Since the beginning of 2009, 222 banks out of 8,305 have failed.) 
 And credit unions charge some of the same fees as banks, including overdraft fees on checking accounts. Credit unions, however, tend to charge lower fees than bigger banks.
 Those who run credit unions often debate among themselves why they do not have a national advertising campaign like ''Got Milk?'' to promote their advantages over banks, said Bill Hampel, the chief economist for the Credit Union National Association, a trade group. But discussion typically breaks down over how to divide the costs. 
 There is also a more elemental problem at work. Most Americans are eligible to join a credit union, but many do not know that they are. This confusion about limited eligibility stems from the fact that until 10 or 15 years ago, credit union membership was often tied to where someone worked. Now, consumers can join many credit unions if they live in the right city or county or simply pay a few dollars to join a membership organization affiliated with a credit union. 
 But even if more people realized that they were eligible for membership, credit unions would still have a thorny branding problem, Mr. Hampel said. ''The first big problem is the word 'credit,' '' he said. ''And the other is 'union.' '' 
 ''Credit'' implies debt, after all, and bad loans have gotten a lot of people into trouble in recent years. And ''union'' makes some people think that they have to join a labor organization to become a credit union member. Discussions about other names, like ''financial services cooperatives,'' have not gone very far. 
 Even the word ''member'' poses problems. ''Consumers in our focus group say that joining sounds like it's hard,'' said Mike Wishnow, a senior vice president for the Pennsylvania Credit Union Association. 
 Also, switching to a credit union is difficult, just as it is with traditional banks. These days it means turning off automated bill payments, setting up new ones someplace else and leaving enough money in both accounts to avoid overdrafts during the transition. 
 Another obstacle to getting more consumers to switch institutions is the fact that credit unions themselves are not-for-profit cooperatives. Without the ceaseless demands of big banks to grow quickly and drive up the stock price, some credit union executives are content with a conservative, almost gentlemanly approach.
 ''We've not gotten into 'Bank vs. Credit Union,' '' said Terry R. West, president and chief executive of VyStar Credit Union in Jacksonville, Fla., one of the state's largest, whose membership grew by 0.6 percent last year. ''We try to emphasize what we do well, and that tends to work.'' 
 George Joseph, chief executive of Dade County Federal Credit Union, also in Florida, says he seeks to maintain a ''home-grown'' style that emphasizes trying to expand relationships with existing members. Membership at his credit union has declined 5 percent in the last two years.
 ''We want to maintain the status quo,'' he said. ''We are not big on going after the membership.''
 Some outsiders have taken marketing matters into their own hands. Late last year, Arianna Huffington, a founder of The Huffington Post, and some like-minded friends made New Year's resolutions to yank money from accounts at large banks and put it someplace smaller. They also created a tool at moveyourmoney.info to help people find community banks and credit unions in their area.
 Some credit unions, too, have not been able to resist a chance to slap the big banks around a bit. BECU in Washington, for one, is running an advertisement urging consumers to ''Switch Now or Pay Later.''
 In California, the SCE Federal Credit Union is running a campaign featuring the tag line, ''I wish banking were less bankish.''
 In Michigan, the Public Service Credit Union decided on an even more in-your-face approach. ''Given all of the news about the bailouts and the fees going up and the executives getting bonuses, there just seemed to be an arrogance there,'' said Amy McGraw, marketing director of Public Service Credit Union in Romulus, Mich. ''And we just said, 'We're so sick of this.' ''
 So Ms. McGraw paid $1,000 to a local producer to create a video that she hoped would go viral on the Internet. She asked a colleague to play the part of a fat cat banker getting into a tub and bathing himself in dollar bills. The tagline? ''What are the big banks really doing with your money?''
 ''I basically went up to him and asked him to get naked for me,'' Ms. McGraw said. ''And he said 'Tell me where and when.' ''

HEADLINE: A Bet on Last Century's Styles To Open This Century's Wallets

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD

 BODY:
For some clothing brands, the summer of 2010 looks a lot like the summer of 1910, and 1949, and 1957 -- basically, any time but now. 
 Eddie Bauer is reintroducing jackets that the company supplied to World War II pilots and 1950s mountaineers. Jantzen's ruffled halter bikini is modeled on a pin-up-girl style it sold in the 1940s. Sperry Top-Siders is selling white buck shoes based on archival pieces. And L. L. Bean has revised a hunting shoe that a 1914 catalog sold with the warning ''You cannot expect success hunting big game if your feet are not properly dressed.''
 Brands are combing their archives in the hope that old clothing styles with a classic feel will assuage consumer anxiety in shaky times. With some Americans feeling as if they can't trust government, Wall Street or big business, the brands are betting their heritage lines will evoke memories of better times -- and help pry open shoppers' wallets.
 ''We've been through a very unsettling time, and it's when people are discontent with the present that they really start appreciating or having a nostalgia for the past,'' said Nigel Hollis, chief global analyst for the market research firm Millward Brown. ''Marketers are seeking to tap into that.'' 
 The public has little confidence in most American institutions, particularly Congress and big business, according to Gallup polls taken over the last several years. And consumers are not spending: after months of sales growth, for example, the Census Bureau reported on Friday that May retail sales declined 1.2 percent, much further than analysts expected and the first decline since the fall. 
 That environment has made items that might draw consumer interest all the more important to the bottom line. Though the companies do not break out sales of heritage products, most say the lines are selling well above projections. And prices tend to be higher than the standard products -- L. L. Bean, for instance, charges about 25 percent more for its ''Signature'' pieces.
 ''There's something major going on right now in the American consumer market and mind-set which is leading people to embrace heritage brands,'' said Neil S. Fiske, chief executive of Eddie Bauer, which introduced heritage items last fall. ''People want to believe in things that are American and want to be part of things that have longevity.''
 Reviving yesterday's long-forgotten products can be both fun and daunting. While it has been tried here and there in the past, it hasn't been done to this degree, the brands say.
 At L. L. Bean, a clothing maker for almost 100 years, the task has fallen to Alex Carleton, the creative director for L. L. Bean's ''Signature'' collection. Housed behind Mr. Bean's old Victorian house off of Main Street in Freeport, Me., the company's archives include rooms full of clothes, lockers stuffed with boots, every catalog ever printed, letters from people like Babe Ruth, and Mr. Bean's hunting journals. 
 Clothes are hung or folded, encased in polypropylene containers, and have little tags explaining their provenance. The archivist insists that visitors put on white cotton gloves when they touch anything, and Mr. Carleton complies. 
 Some clothes he found were inspirational.
 He redesigned a women's wrap skirt, promoted in the spring 1957 catalog as ''suitable for sport and camping wear,'' as a casual chambray wrap skirt, with a slimmer fit and shorter length. For a restyling of a 1940s hunting jacket, he removed the plastic lining of the ''kill pocket'' in the back of the coat, originally meant to hold freshly shot bloody ducks. 
 Other pieces, Mr. Carleton said, did not make the cut. 
 He uncovered especially odd items from the 1970s, an era he plans to draw from for the fall 2011 collection. Some of those oddities: an angora colic band that wrapped around the torso was meant to warm the lower back and a men's Labrador parka that is ''a pull-over-the-head piece that practically goes down to your knees,'' he said. There is also a women's Tundra sweater made of thick white wool with a tiny hood and odd black-and-yellow trim at the cuffs, and a face mask made of deer skin that ''completely covers the face, including nose, chin, ears and throat.'' 
 ''We want to make sure we're not producing garments that are going to make people walking around look like they just stepped out of an ice storm,'' he said.
 Mr. Fiske, of Eddie Bauer, also turned to an archivist to assemble old items for inspiration. The company recently introduced clothes like the B-9 parka, which Mr. Bauer supplied to the Army Air Forces during World War II, and the Skyliner jacket, a quilted coat that Mr. Bauer designed after a freezing winter fishing expedition.
 At the swimwear company Jantzen, which introduced a heritage collection this spring, more updating was necessary. Take a maillot bathing suit, inspired by a swimsuit from the Twenties. Now, the bathing suit is a red one-piece number with a crystal band and a hint of a skirt. Then, it was knit from wool, weighed more than eight pounds when wet, and was meant for both women and men, said Lorraine Medici, vice president of marketing at Jantzen.
 Other brands glancing backward include Halston, which reworked designs from the Seventies to create its heritage line. Sperry Top-Siders is selling limited-edition shoes with old-school styling, like brick-colored soles. Keds is issuing two shoe designs for each decade from the last century (a 1920s sneaker looks almost like a dress shoe, with black and white details). 
 The trend extends to other industries, too. Earlier this year, General Mills sold some Lucky Charms and Cheerios in limited-edition vintage boxes. Pepsi-Cola brought back limited-edition Pepsi and Mountain Dew with retro labels late last year. And Carl's Jr. brought back a vintage menu item -- chili dogs, which Carl Karcher sold from a cart in the 1940s -- last year.
 The popularity of nostalgic items is not entirely because of the bad economy, said Lands' End's president, Nick Coe, who said he expected that the company's historically inspired Canvas line would sell well even if the economy improved. And it is not always about good memories, either; the economy for much of the Seventies, for example, was a disaster. 
 ''Buying habits have pretty seriously changed from the crazy consumption of the previous decade,'' Mr. Coe said. ''It's not necessarily about cheap -- it's about real value.''
 ''The days of frivolous spending or buying stuff that's disposable have gone away,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Nebraska Moves to the Big Ten, Pushing the Big 12 to the Brink

BYLINE: By PETE THAMEL; Richard Sandomir contributed reporting.. 
Richard Sandomir contributed reporting.

 BODY:
In another dizzying day that will long be remembered as part of the reshaping of college sports, two universities with brand-name football programs announced they were leaving their conferences. 
 As expected, Nebraska's regents voted on Friday to join the Big Ten Conference in 2011, giving that league 12 members. The decision could be the fatal blow to the Big 12 Conference, which now has 10 members and appears on the verge of collapse. 
 In a somewhat surprising move -- at least in the timing -- Boise State announced that it would leave the Western Athletic Conference and join the Mountain West in 2011. 
 Nebraska and Boise State have joined Colorado, which announced on Thursday that it was leaving the Big 12 for the Pacific-10, to form the first wave of conference realignment. 
 At least four other universities -- Texas, Texas Tech, Oklahoma and Oklahoma State -- are expected to announce they are heading to the Pac-10 in the next week, though developments late Friday made that less of an inevitability. Interference could come from both the state Legislature in Texas and from the United States Congress, possibly slowing the realignment process.
 Senator Jay Rockefeller, Democrat of West Virginia and the chairman of the Commerce Committee, said he would hold hearings in July about the realignment, and the Higher Education Committee in Texas said it would meet next week about the possible breakup of the Big 12. 
 What is the motivation of universities that abandon tradition and rivalries to change leagues?
 ''The motivator is money and the issue is TV,'' the former Syracuse athletic director Jake Crouthamel said. ''It's strictly about money. The presidents sit back there and they say that we'd like to have similar academic institutions and research institutions and it's bull. If you can play and win, that's all that it takes, and you're in a good market.'' 
 Texas is expected to announce its decision on Tuesday, and barring any last-ditch efforts to save the Big 12, it will join the Pac-10. The Texas athletic director, DeLoss Dodds, though, released a statement on Friday saying that the university hoped to keep the Big 12 together. At this point, that appears unlikely. 
 The new so-called Pac-16, which is looking less likely to include Texas A&M, is poised to become a giant player in television. (The Pac-10's television deals expire in 2011, and it would use the new teams as a strong negotiating lever for a new contract.) 
 The bold expansion move by the Pac-10's first-year commissioner, Larry Scott, is a swift and stunning departure from the Pac-10's reputation -- the league was always considered conservative and undervalued, a financial underachiever in its television deals. 
 The Pac-10's five-year deals with ESPN and Fox Sports Net for football are reportedly worth a combined $222 million, minuscule compared with the deals of other major conferences. 
 ''He's done what he was hired to do,'' WAC Commissioner Karl Benson said of Scott. ''That's to change the way that the Pac-10 has done business in the past.''
 The addition of Colorado and the expected addition of Texas enable the Pac-10 to have a larger presence in the Mountain and Central time zones, and it will be able to penetrate three more three top-20 television markets -- Denver, Dallas and Houston. 
 Although no official announcement has been made, the expanded Pac-10 is expected to start its own television network, similar to the Big Ten Network. 
 Fox, which could back the network financially, is expected to be the leading suitor for the league's television rights, with games being shown on Fox, its FSN channels and also a Pac-10 network. 
 ''If you're positive that a network can make 80 cents a subscriber in its footprint -- then all of a sudden, if your footprint is double what it was going to be, and includes the West Coast states and the state of Texas, you're talking about a considerably larger network,'' said Neal Pilson, the former president of CBS Sports and a television consultant.
 Universities are realigning and seeking millions of dollars because they and college athletics in general are under extreme pressure to generate revenue. 
 ''In light of the economic crisis in higher education and intercollegiate athletics, conferences are being looked at and expected by our membership to maximize revenues,'' Benson said. ''This is all about maximizing revenues at the top.''
 That is why the Southeastern Conference is considering adding Texas A&M, even without a logical dance partner -- Texas or Oklahoma. The Texas A&M regent Gene Stallings said in a telephone interview on Friday that Texas A&M would consider a move to the SEC without Texas. He said that it was his understanding that Texas had no interest in the SEC. It appears that the Aggies' interest in potentially following Texas to the Pac-10 has dwindled. 
 ''I would have no problem with A&M going to the SEC,'' Stallings said. ''If it's to our advantage to go to one or the other, I would vote that way. I just don't know what the options are.''
 As the dominoes in conference expansion are falling, many wonder if the pursuit of money is hurting college sports. 
 ''There is certainly an opportunity for the N.C.A.A. to exert some leadership and step into all of this and start looking at the future of intercollegiate athletics, what is best for the total enterprise and not just individual conferences and institutions,'' Sun Belt Commissioner Wright Waters said.

HEADLINE: Awaiting Holidays' Electronics (And Sales)

BYLINE: By SETH SCHIESEL

 BODY:
There is no more important annual event in interactive entertainment than E3, the Electronic Entertainment Expo. Closed to most of the public, E3 next week will attract tens of thousands of developers and journalists to the Los Angeles Convention Center, where the games and systems that will supposedly drive the industry through the fall, the holiday season and beyond will be showcased. 
 As game makers, if you are not Blizzard Entertainment (World of Warcraft) or Rockstar Games (Grand Theft Auto) -- the two quasi-independent publishers that define the industry's most exalted tier of power and popularity -- you pretty much have to be there.
 The mood at this year's E3 looks to be one of cautious confidence, judging from conversations I recently had with top executives at some of the big American game publishers. Even though software retail sales have been lackluster so far this year amid the overall recession, gaming online and on mobile devices like the iPhone is booming. 
 And the arrival of Wii competitors and the first batch of 3-D games promises more innovation. Here are the key concepts I will be keeping in mind at this year's E3:
 DOES THE HOLIDAY SEASON EVEN MATTER ANYMORE? (OR, IS MARCH THE NEW OCTOBER?)
 There has never been a first half of any calendar year that has matched the bounty of the first half of 2010. The best, most interesting games of 2010 so far have been Red Dead Redemption from Rockstar and Heavy Rain from Sony, but players have also been treated to other major titles, including God of War III, Bayonetta, Final Fantasy XIII, Nier, Mass Effect 2, Super Mario Galaxy 2, Alan Wake, Battlefield: Bad Company 2, BioShock 2 and Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Conviction, not to mention a new Pokemon.
 So can this coming holiday season, promising games like new versions of Halo and Call of Duty, possibly compete? The 2010 roster has already been so compelling that at least some executives seem to fear that the industry may be leading consumers into unrealistic expectations.
 ''No, I've never seen this before,'' said Christoph Hartmann, president of 2K Games, which released BioShock 2 in February. ''I don't even know if it's good for consumers. It's like an overflow of chocolate and then a drought of chocolate, and as a chocolate addict, I don't want that. At one level it's good, but at another level it's dangerous, because the consumers' expectation of quality is driven too high. In general it's a trend we have to watch: that we're not digging our own grave in that the expectations of people are so high that we're just not able to fulfill it.''
 My job is constantly to drive expectations of quality in video games higher and higher, so I say, bring it on. A great game will earn its due no matter when it is released.
 ''I don't think I've ever seen a lineup like this in the first six months of the year,'' said Pete Hines, vice president for marketing at Bethesda Softworks, which recently revived the classic Fallout series and whose parent company, ZeniMax Media, acquired iD Software, originators of the Doom and Quake franchises. ''I don't know if there are major implications for the holiday,'' he said, but added, ''It just means people have had a lot more to spend their money on now rather than having it to spend later in the year.''
 LOOK MA, NO CONTROLLER! (BUT CAN ANYONE MAKE MONEY LIKE THAT?)
 The most important development in gaming over the last several years was Nintendo's introduction and ingenious marketing of the Wii. At a moment when video games were in danger of being relegated to the fringe of mass entertainment and culture, a la comic books, Nintendo delivered brilliantly on the belief that people who would never pick up a traditional button-covered controller could still be attracted to gaming. It gave those people a new sort of intuitive interface: a wand that you can just wave around.
 Microsoft and Sony are now playing catch up. Microsoft's biggest push at E3 will be around Natal, an add-on for the Xbox 360 expected later this year that uses a camera to allow you to control on-screen action without holding any physical device. Theoretically, Natal lets you physically kick your leg to strike a soccer ball or wave your hand to control a virtual paintbrush. Meanwhile, Sony will be hyping Move, a new system for the Playstation 3 that involves Wii-like devices shaped a bit like ice cream cones instead of customary controllers.
 But here's the thing: almost no one besides Nintendo itself has made much money on the Wii (Disney, with its emphasis on kids' games, is one of the few). And that raises the question of whether Natal and Move will provide much opportunity for outside developers interested in making high-end games. 
 ''Natal games at 60 bucks are probably a stretch,'' said Frank Gibeau, president of EA Games, referring to the price of most big-name titles. But he added that the strength and popularity of the Xbox Live service from Microsoft made the prospect of cheaper downloadable games using Natal potentially more attractive. 
 Graham Hopper, executive vice president and general manager for Disney Interactive Studios, which has not achieved huge success on the Xbox and PlayStation in the past, would not comment on any specific deals with Microsoft and Sony. But, he said, ''When I look at Move and Natal and their motion-sensing interfaces, it gives me a lot of encouragement about the future of the Disney brand on those platforms.'' 
 THE 'AVATAR' EFFECT (OR, GET READY TO DUCK!)
 I am initially skeptical about the viability of 3-D gaming technology in the near term. But I'm willing to be convinced, and I have come to expect a lot of convincing at this year's E3. 
 Nintendo has already announced that it is developing a 3-D version of its popular DS handheld, but I expect the real surprises to come from Sony.
 There is a lot going on here. First, Sony makes fabulous televisions, while Microsoft doesn't make TVs at all. That gives Sony a unique impetus and opportunity to develop and market home 3-D technology. Second, in actually delivering 3-D content, the PlayStation 3, with its Blu-ray storage and superior silicon horsepower, would logically appear to have an advantage over the Xbox 360, with its mere DVD storage. 
 As with the motion-sensing technologies, I'll be keeping an eye on which outside publishers Sony has been able to get on board with 3-D gaming. The other big question is whether Microsoft will have any 3-D initiative of its own or whether those folks from Redmond, Wash., have put all their eggs for now in the Natal basket.

HEADLINE: To Save Africa, Reject Its Nations

BYLINE: By PIERRE ENGLEBERT. 
Pierre Englebert, a professor of African politics at Pomona College, is the author, most recently, of ''Africa: Unity, Sovereignty and Sorrow.''

 BODY:
Claremont, Calif.
 THE World Cup, which began on Friday, is bringing deserved appreciation of South Africa as a nation that transitioned from white minority domination to a vibrant pluralist democracy. Yet its achievements stand largely alone on the continent. Of the 17 African nations that are commemorating their 50th anniversaries of independence this year -- the Democratic Republic of Congo and Somalia will both do so in the coming weeks -- few have anything to truly celebrate.
 Five decades ago, African independence was worth rejoicing over: these newly created states signaled an end to the violent, humiliating Western domination of the continent, and they were quickly recognized by the international community. Sovereignty gave fledgling elites the shield to protect their weak states against continued colonial subjugation and the policy instruments to promote economic development. 
 Yet because these countries were recognized by the international community before they even really existed, because the gift of sovereignty was granted from outside rather than earned from within, it came without the benefit of popular accountability, or even a social contract between rulers and citizens. 
 Buttressed by the legality and impunity that international sovereignty conferred upon their actions, too many of Africa's politicians and officials twisted the normal activities of a state beyond recognition, transforming mundane tasks like policing, lawmaking and taxation into weapons of extortion. 
 So, for the past five decades, most Africans have suffered predation of colonial proportions by the very states that were supposed to bring them freedom. And most of these nations, broke from their own thievery, are now unable to provide their citizens with basic services like security, roads, hospitals and schools. What can be done?
 The first and most urgent task is that the donor countries that keep these nations afloat should cease sheltering African elites from accountability. To do so, the international community must move swiftly to derecognize the worst-performing African states, forcing their rulers -- for the very first time in their checkered histories -- to search for support and legitimacy at home. 
 Radical as this idea may sound, it is not without precedent. Undemocratic Taiwan was derecognized by most of the world in the 1970s (as the corollary of recognizing Beijing). This loss of recognition led the ruling Kuomintang party to adopt new policies in search of domestic support. The regime liberalized the economy, legalized opposition groups, abolished martial law, organized elections and even issued an apology to the Taiwanese people for past misrule, eventually turning the country into a fast-growing, vibrant democracy. 
 In Africa, similarly, the unrecognized, breakaway state of Somaliland provides its citizens with relative peace and democracy, offering a striking counterpoint to the violence and misery of neighboring sovereign Somalia. It was in part the absence of recognition that forced the leaders of the Somali National Movement in the early '90s to strike a bargain with local clan elders and create legitimate participatory institutions in Somaliland.
 What does this mean in practice? Donor governments would tell the rulers of places like Chad, Congo, Equatorial Guinea or Sudan -- all nightmares to much of their populations -- that they no longer recognize them as sovereign states. Instead, they would agree to recognize only African states that provide their citizens with a minimum of safety and basic rights. 
 The logistics of derecognition would no doubt be complicated. Embassies would be withdrawn on both sides. These states would be expelled from the United Nations and other international organizations. All macroeconomic, budget-supporting and post-conflict reconstruction aid programs would be canceled. (Nongovernmental groups and local charities would continue to receive money.)
 If this were to happen, relatively benevolent states like South Africa and a handful of others would go on as before. But in the continent's most troubled countries, politicians would suddenly lose the legal foundations of their authority. Some of these repressive leaders, deprived of their sovereign tools of domination and the international aid that underwrites their regimes, might soon find themselves overthrown. 
 African states that begin to provide their citizens with basic rights and services, that curb violence and that once again commit resources to development projects, would be rewarded with re-recognition by the international community. Aid would return. More important, these states would finally have acquired some degree of popular accountability and domestic legitimacy.
 Like any experiment, de- and re-recognition is risky. Some fear it could promote conflict, that warlords would simply seize certain mineral-rich areas and run violent, lawless quasi states. But Africa is already rife with violence, and warlordism is already a widespread phenomenon. While unrecognized countries might still mistreat their people, history shows that weak, isolated regimes have rarely been able to survive without making significant concessions to segments of their populations.
 For many Africans, 50 years of sovereignty has been an abject failure, reproducing the horrors of colonial-era domination under the guise of freedom. International derecognition of abusive states would be a first step toward real liberation.

HEADLINE: S.C. Strikes Again

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS

 BODY:
Alvin Greene filed for our sins. 
 Greene, an unemployed 32-year-old, is currently the most famous Democratic candidate in South Carolina. He just won the nomination to run against Senator Jim DeMint in November, overcoming major obstacles such as not having campaign staff, campaign funds, a campaign Web site, cellphone or personal computer. And then there's the felony charge pending for allegedly showing a University of South Carolina student a pornographic picture.
 I'm sorry we have to keep coming back to South Carolina. There are 50 states, and I'm sure every single one has some really peculiar political phenomena that we could make fun of if time allowed. 
 But South Carolina has definitely been on a roll. Earlier this week, it looked as if the big primary story was the two Republican political consultants who claimed to have had sexual encounters with Nikki Haley, a candidate for governor. Haley went on to finish 27 percentage points ahead of her closest rival. Having endured so many sex scandals with male candidates, we have long wondered what would happen when women running for high office started to get hit with adultery charges. Apparently, it makes them more popular.
 Now there's Alvin Greene. To get on the ballot in South Carolina, a candidate for Senate has to pay a $10,440 filing fee. By now, there are political junkies in every part of the United States who could make a list of things that Greene needed to spend money on more than he needed to be on an election ballot. The cellphone and computer would be nice. His own apartment. (He lives with his dad.) And a lawyer, since he's currently being represented by a public defender in the obscenity case.
 ''That I'm not commenting on,'' he said on MSNBC.
 Normally, hopeless candidates for high office are either dedicated to a cause or drenched in ego. Either way, they bloom under TV camera lights. Greene wilts. He haltingly ascribed his win to ''simple old-fashioned campaigning,'' which did not seem to involve any gathering featuring other people.
 Suspicious minds wondered if this was a plot. ''I don't know if he was a Republican plant; he was somebody's plant,'' said Representative James Clyburn.
 At any rate, Senator DeMint, a darling of the Tea Party set, is now getting a free ride to re-election. He's the guy who compared the United States in the age of Obama to ''where Germany was before World War II.'' He appears to be positioning himself as a future Senate Republican leader, and South Carolina Democrats have now given lots of additional free time to a person who makes Mitch McConnell look like a good idea.
 The candidate who was supposed to win the nomination was Vic Rawl, a well-spoken former judge who vastly overestimated the number of people around the state who recognized his name. 
 ''Voters seem less and less well informed,'' said Carol Fowler, the Democratic state party chairwoman.
 Or at least we're demanding more and more of them. When Greene came in to file his candidacy papers, Fowler recognized that there was something wrong. But she didn't feel it was her responsibility to get the word out. 
 ''We did research him to the extent we could,'' she said. ''For whatever reason, this business of his indictment did not come to the top.'' She pointed out that in another race the party successfully unearthed the fact that a Congressional candidate ''had served time in the pen,'' thus reinforcing my conviction that South Carolina is the best place in the world to be a political reporter.
 The state has open primaries, and it's possible that thousands of Republicans cannily crossed over to give DeMint a pathetic opponent. But voters generally aren't that sneaky. It's more likely that Democrats drew a blank, then flipped a mental coin. The exception was in neighborhoods where local party leaders passed out sample ballots with their recommended candidates, and helped people avoid voting to turn a clearly troubled guy with large legal problems into a U.S. Senate nominee.
 We've spent decades now working on the assumption that the problem with American politics is the strength of political parties. This week, California eliminated party primaries entirely in favor of a system where all the candidates run on one ballot and the two top finishers move on to the November election. We'll have to see how that works, although it's a good rule of thumb to figure that anything approved in a California referendum will make things worse.
 The alternative to parties is an every-voter-for-herself system that would inevitably leave people staring at endless choices among candidates they've never heard of. The polling places become casinos where you pull the lever and pray. Maybe the real answer is not to make the parties weaker but to make them better.

HEADLINE: More Spending By Bloomberg In '09 as Stocks Bounced Back

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO

 BODY:
After a decade of conspicuous consumption -- a town house here, a private jet there -- Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg seemed to slam on the brakes in 2008 during the recession. He bought no new property, rented out space in a vacation home and -- horrors! -- cut back on household staff.
 The year was, by billionaire standards, a hardship. 
 But as the stock market bounced back in 2009, so did Mr. Bloomberg's personal spending. Over the last year, he poured at least $500,000 into a trust fund for his former wife, Susan, and he restored the domestic staff that he somehow did without, according to his tax returns and financial disclosure forms released on Friday.
 Mr. Bloomberg not only felt flush, he was. Records show his wide-ranging investments, which lost money in 2008, turned a tidy profit in 2009. He picked up a few extra dollars for his appearances on television shows like ''Law & Order.'' And he pocketed a respectable sum, at least $40,000, from a new business: leasing out the horses he keeps on his estate in Wellington, Fla. 
 Just how much he made last year is unclear, given the highly controlled manner in which the mayor discloses his finances. For about two hours on Friday, as in years past, the mayor made his tax documents available to reporters at the offices of his accountant, but forbade them from making copies. 
 The documents were edited for the presentation, displaying earnings and losses not as dollar amounts but as ranges represented by letters A ($1,000 to $5,000) to G ($500,000 or more). 
 Once decoded, they showed income of at least $12 million from investments, which ranged from municipal bonds to European stocks. Mr. Bloomberg preaches the doctrine of diversification, and he appeared to practice it: he made money from accounts managed by Deutsche Bank, HSBC, Merrill Lynch, Charles Schwab and Bank of America. 
 Not all his investments worked out: he lost at least $6 million on various stock market funds. And, as with many investors, his financial losses from 2008 were greater than his gains in 2009.
 Mr. Bloomberg invested most of his fortune with Quadrangle, a private equity firm founded by his friend Steven Rattner, a Wall Street financier. In 2008, as the stock market tumbled, the mayor's Quadrangle funds lost millions. But in 2009, they returned to the black, which may help explain why, several months ago, Mr. Bloomberg recruited the firm's money managers to create his own investment office, to be run out of the same $45 million town house as his philanthropic foundation. 
 As usual, the mayor's tax returns are filled with telling glimpses into the world of a man worth an estimated $18 billion. They show that the horses he owned won at least four equestrian prizes, valued at as much as $55,000. (His daughter Georgina is a top rider.) They reveal that an acquaintance of the mayor, Gregory Vereschagin, has not paid him back for a loan, worth at least $100,000, that was due eight years ago. 
 The returns show that his payroll taxes on household staff rose to between $250,000 and $500,000, up from the previous year's range of $100,000 to $250,000. And they suggest that Mr. Bloomberg is an unusually cordial, generous former husband, who thought nothing of transferring hundreds of thousands of dollars to Susan Bloomberg, whom he divorced in 1993.
 Such magnanimity, it turns out, does not end with former wives. Years ago, after Mr. Bloomberg broke up with a companion, Mary Jane Salk, a writer and widow of the psychologist Lee Salk, he gave her a trust fund worth at least $500,000 and a Park Avenue condominium, which he bought in 2000 for $3.75 million.

HEADLINE: Gates Criticizes Turkey on Iran Sanctions

BYLINE: By JAMES KANTER; Edward Wong contributed reporting from Beijing.

 BODY:
BRUSSELS -- Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates expressed frustration with Turkey on Friday over its refusal to support a new round of United Nations sanctions against Iran, but he suggested that the alliance between Washington and Ankara remained robust. 
 ''I'll be honest, I was disappointed in Turkey's vote on the Iranian sanctions,'' Mr. Gates said at the end of a two-day meeting of defense ministers at the headquarters of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in Brussels. ''Allies don't always agree on things, but we move forward from here.'' 
 The Security Council on Wednesday approved its fourth round of sanctions against Iran over its nuclear program. Twelve of the 15 nations on the Security Council voted for the measure, while Brazil and Turkey, which had negotiated a deal with Iran to swap some of its nuclear fuel, voted against, and Lebanon abstained. 
 Mr. Gates's comments echoed remarks by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, who said Wednesday that she disagreed with Turkey and Brazil, but that those countries could still play a part in diplomacy with Iran. Among other things, the sanctions took aim at military purchases, trade and financial transactions by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, which controls Iran's nuclear program and has taken a more central role in running the country and the economy. 
 Iran asserts that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, but its enrichment of uranium to higher levels of purity has raised suspicions in the West that it is seeking to develop a nuclear weapon. 
 Mr. Gates said that ''we have some more time'' to increase pressure on Iran to counter its nuclear ambitions. He said that ''most people think'' it could take at least a year or two for Iran to develop a nuclear weapon, and longer to develop systems to deliver such a weapon.
 President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran, speaking Friday in Shanghai after touring the World Expo, called the Security Council's resolution ''a worthless piece of paper,'' The Associated Press reported. 
 ''The U.S. president thinks by accusing the nation of Iran he can undermine the role of our country in the world,'' Mr. Ahmadinejad said. ''I think President Obama has made a big mistake.''

HEADLINE: Day 52: The Latest on the Oil Spill

 BODY:
Gas Leak Sickens 36 on Service Vessel
 An incident on a supply vessel moored to a natural-gas riser platform and pipeline near Cocodrie, La., resulted in a release of natural gas on Friday morning, officials said. Of the 41 people on board, 36 were taken to hospitals. Symptoms ranged from scratchy throats to coughs and nausea, officials said in a statement. Two of the 36 complained of shortness of breath, disorientation and chest pains. 
 BP Stock Rises Again
 BP shares were up for a second day on Friday, despite a growing debate about whether the oil company should defer its second-quarter dividend and put the money in escrow until liabilities from the spill are determined. Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain and President Obama are expected to discuss BP's situation via telephone this weekend.
 Two Mayors Are at Odds ...
 A day after Boris Johnson, the Conservative mayor of London, said he was worried that American politicians' ''anti-British rhetoric'' might affect British pension funds' ''huge exposure'' to BP, Mayor Mitch Landrieu of New Orleans responded, urging Mr. Johnson to ''park his anger at the water's edge and redirect it towards BP.'' He continued: ''This is not America versus Great Britain. It's people, families and their livelihoods versus a negligent corporation that is responsible for the loss of 11 lives and an oil spill that threatens our coast, our environment and our economy. In fact, our entire way of life is at risk.''
 ... While Another Defends BP
 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York defended BP on his weekly radio program. ''The guy that runs BP didn't exactly go down there and blow up the well,'' Mr. Bloomberg said. ''And what's more, if we want them to fix it and they're the only ones with the expertise, I think I might wait to assign blame.''

HEADLINE: BIDS AT ISSUE IN RANGERS SALE

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR

 BODY:
Since the Texas Rangers agreed to a sale to a group led by Chuck Greenberg and Nolan Ryan for $575 million earlier this year, creditors of the team's parent company have insisted that other bidders would have paid more. 
 In a brief filed Friday in United States bankruptcy court in Fort Worth, Tex., the creditors cited correspondence from a lawyer for the Hicks Sports Group, which is selling the team, saying that a Houston businessman named Jim Crane offered a much better deal than Ryan and Greenberg.
 Glenn West, legal counsel to H.S.G., wrote last December to a lawyer for J. P. Morgan, the creditors' representative, saying, ''Crane now has a clearly superior economic deal - and may always have had based on Greenberg's current position.''
 But Major League Baseball told H.S.G. that it had ''our permission to negotiate only with the Greenberg group,'' the filing says. In response, West wrote on New Year's Eve to Thomas Ostertag, M.L.B.'s general counsel: ''It appears Greenberg is using your position to simply refuse to negotiate in good faith; and the result will be a bad one for the team and our lenders (whose consent is absolutely required, just like yours, for whatever is ultimately done here).''
 In mid-January, West wrote to the J. P. Morgan lawyer, ''It is unlikely we can recommend that we proceed forward with Greenberg,'' and that he wasn't certain further talks would narrow the gap between the bids.
 The creditors' filing says that Crane's offer was worth $13 million to $20 million more than the Greenberg-Ryan bid and that Crane told H.S.G. and M.L.B. that he would have gone still higher.
 Additionally, the brief says that in the days before the Rangers filed a petition for bankruptcy protection last month, H.S.G. made a series of maneuvers, including some shifts of assets between subsidiaries, that made it ''prohibitively expensive for a better transaction to be approved.''
 The Rangers were put up for sale after H.S.G., which is controlled by Thomas O. Hicks and owns the Rangers and Dallas Stars, defaulted on $525 million in loans in March 2009.
 M.L.B. has firmly backed Greenberg and Ryan, but H.S.G.'s creditors have balked at their deal because they feel they could recover more from a higher offer. They hope the bankruptcy judge will order a new auction.
 A memorandum of law filed with the court on Friday by Texas Rangers Baseball Partners, the entity that is being sold, does not address the statements by West, the H.S.G. lawyer. It said that the Greenberg-Ryan bid ''offered the best combination of price and least execution risk.''
 This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Spill's Long-Lasting Effects

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 ''Coast Guard Sees Oil Spill Cleanup Lasting into Fall'' (front page, June 7) implies that things could be fine in the Gulf of Mexico (and the oceans) by late fall. 
 In fact, this oil spill will diminish the health and wealth of generations of humans, destroy the food chain and habitats of generations of animals (fish, fowl and human) and irreparably harm the ocean's ecosystems.
 The dispersants used in cleanup efforts will harm all the living things they touch. These poisons will be carried by birds to faraway ecosystems on land and water and travel to all parts of the oceans via currents and fish.
 It's impossible to ''clean up'' a disaster of this magnitude.
 American energy policies currently subsidize and encourage our addiction to oil. I can only hope that the gulf oil spill makes us recognize the true dangers and costs of fossil fuels and that we act with urgency to create a renewable energy infrastructure and economy for the 21st century.
 Otherwise, shame on us.

HEADLINE: Weak Math Skills Linked to Default

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
IF you can't divide 300 by 2, should you qualify for a loan?
 That is one of the questions raised by a new study led by a Columbia University assistant business professor, Stephan Meier, who found that borrowers with poor math skills were two times more likely than others to go into foreclosure.
 Mr. Meier conceded that the results were not shocking, but he said he had not expected the connection between math skills and mortgage default to be so pronounced. 
 About 340 borrowers in Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island who took out subprime loans in 2006 and 2007 were surveyed in 2008. None were in foreclosure.
 The respondents were asked five questions, with the first requiring borrowers to divide 300 by 2, and the second to calculate 10 percent of 1,000. (Since the survey was conducted by telephone, the questioners did not know who was using a calculator.)
 About 16 percent of the respondents answered at least one of the first two questions incorrectly. Mr. Meier said that the results were consistent among all levels of education and income.
 Over all, 21 percent of the respondents whose math abilities placed them in the bottom quarter of the survey experienced foreclosure, versus 7 percent of those in the top quarter.
 Mr. Meier said the fact that the borrowers in the sample had subprime loans -- which in 2006 and 2007 were given even to those with dismal financial histories -- did not lessen the significance of the findings. A larger survey in Britain, he said, found nearly the same levels of math illiteracy among those questioned about retirement savings.
 Mr. Meier said the study had at least two implications for mortgage lenders. ''Maybe start adding math tests to the process,'' he said, ''and screen them away.''
 The other alternative, he said, would be working to help borrowers improve their financial literacy before they took out the loan.
 ''There are a lot of financial decisions you have to make as a homeowner,'' he noted, ''but some of the more difficult decisions have to do with how to rebudget if you're hit by an income shock, which a lot of people had to do during the recession.''
 Mortgage lenders, brokers and counselors mostly agree that it's difficult to gauge a borrower's math skills under the current mortgage-application system.
 ''A lot of payment numbers are discussed,'' said Richard L. Tracy Jr., the chief executive of Campbell Mortgage in West Haven, Conn., ''but by that time the computer programs have already done the math.''
 Mr. Tracy said that although he believed financial literacy and math skills were important predictors of a borrower's ability to pay, borrowers deficient in those respects would most likely also have weak credit scores.
 Jacqui Atcheson, a senior loan officer with Prospect Mortgage of Sherman Oaks, Calif., said that she worked closely on budgeting possibilities with any borrower whose credit history was checkered. She added that she would not offer a loan to a borrower she found lacking in the mathematical or financial skills needed to pay it back, even if the borrower could qualify for a mortgage.
 Eileen Anderson, a senior vice president of the Community Development Corporation of Long Island, a nonprofit housing organization, says her group counsels struggling borrowers through the foreclosure-avoidance process. ''Many of them don't understand how to do a budget -- which is basic math, I guess,'' she said.
 Borrowers who receive prepurchase buyer education are less likely to end up in foreclosure than those who do not, she added.
 ''In our programs,'' Ms. Anderson said, ''we're doing the math with them, not for them.''
 And better-educated borrowers are not exempt, either.
 ''People say they're doctors, so they don't really need it,'' she said. ''So what? We see doctors who took out loans they didn't understand, and who are in foreclosure now.''

CORRECTION-DATE: June 20, 2010

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The Mortgages column last Sunday, about a study on math skills and the likelihood of foreclosure, misstated the proportion of borrowers with poor math skills who went into foreclosure versus those with the best skills. Those borrowers were two times more likely to experience foreclosure, not three times more likely.

HEADLINE: A Final Report From Internal Affairs

BYLINE: By CLARK HOYT

 BODY:
THIS is my last column as public editor of The Times.
 For the past three years, my assignment has been to try to help this newspaper live up to its own high journalistic standards as it covered a historic presidential election, two wars, the Great Recession, violence in the Middle Eastand more. I have deplored the overuse of anonymous sources, warned against the creep of opinion into news analysis and worried about the preservation of Times quality on the Internet. But, in truth, I have sometimes felt less like a keeper of the flame and more like an internal affairs cop. ''What did I do now?'' a reporter asked with a sigh when I called recently. 
 It takes a lot of courage for an institution like The Times to invite someone like me into its midst: an outsider with no investment in its mystique or the quirks of its newsroom culture. I was handed the equivalent of a loaded gun -- space in the newspaper and on its Web site to write whatever I chose about its journalistic performance. My contract stipulated that I reported to no one and could be fired for only two reasons: failing to do any work or violating the company's written ethics guidelines. I tried hard to be responsible with the power. The contract, designed to guarantee independence, came with term limits, and my term ends this week, as will any formal association with The Times. A new public editor, also from outside, will be named soon.
 Steven Goldberg, a reader from Needham, Mass., wrote recently to say that, like a Supreme Court justice, I should be appointed public editor for life, ''whether he wants the job or not.'' I appreciate the vote of confidence, but it really is time to go. I know of at least one reader who would agree. She wrote in 2008 to tell me that I had no standards whatsoever and that I ''must have made a deal with the devil at a young age.'' She would not let me use her name in this column because she said she did not want to lend authenticity to ''such a pitiful guardian of truth and fairness.''
 Each of my predecessors, Daniel Okrent and Byron Calame, faced some degree of resistance from the newsroom, and I do not think anyone thought it would go down easy for me. On my first day on the job, Arthur Sulzberger Jr., the publisher, sat opposite me in a little room off his office, clapped his hands on his knees and said with a laugh: ''Well, you're here. You must be dumber than you look.''
 But my reception by the newsroom turned out to be accepting and unfailingly professional, in large part, I believe, because Okrent and Calame persevered, established the position and made it matter. Times journalists have been astonishingly candid, even when facing painful questions any of us would want to duck. Of course, journalists don't relish being criticized in public any more than anyone else. A writer shaken by a conclusion I was reaching told me, if you say that, I'll have to kill myself. I said, no, you won't. Well, the writer said, I'll have to go in the hospital. I wrote what I intended, with no ill consequences for anyone's health.
 Those histrionics were extreme and unique. The rule was thoughtful engagement. Take Steve Berman, a respected veteran photo editor, one of several journalists who failed to check out the obituary of a photographer who for years had claimed, falsely, that he took the iconic picture of John F. Kennedy Jr. saluting his slain father's casket. After a column pointing out all the missed warning signs, Berman came to thank me. He said he believed in accountability and had learned from the experience. I was surprised but came to know that I should not have been.
 Bill Keller, the executive editor, once joked as we walked down the passageway to his office for an interview that he was heading for his weekly proctological exam. But throughout my tenure, Keller was gracious and supportive. When we had what was certainly our disagreement of greatest consequence -- over the Times article suggesting that John McCain had had an extramarital affair with a young female lobbyist -- Keller showed great equanimity. I said The Times had been off base. Though the story gave ammunition to critics who said the paper was biased, and it was no help to have the public editor joining thousands of readers questioning his judgment about it, Keller said mildly that we would just have to disagree on this one.
 The Times stirs passions among those who read it and those who refuse to. ''Dear NYT,'' wrote Sam Gammon of Austin, Tex., ''I love you dearly and have loved you fervently for many years.'' Kevin Keller of Knoxville, Tenn., said The Times is a ''liberal rag'' he would never subscribe to.
 The public editor receives as many as 300 messages on a typical day, and the total can spike into the thousands if a blogger or one of the media watchdog sites urges its followers to protest something the paper has published. Coverage of presidential politics in 2008, the Middle East at any time, and the latest developments in the sex abuse scandal in the Catholic Church reliably produced torrents of protest. But the small stuff matters to readers as well. How could The Times have published this sentence in a recent Vows column: ''Like she, Mr. Cheong was dating someone at the time.'' Like she? Mistakes like this, still uncorrected on the paper's Web site, make readers wonder whether editing standards are crumbling under the demands of the 24/7 news cycle. And, if The Times is too often getting little things wrong, they ask, what about the big things?
 For all of my three years, I heard versions of Kevin Keller's accusation: The Times is a ''liberal rag,'' pursuing a partisan agenda in its news columns. There is no question that the editorial page is liberal and the regular columnists on the Op-Ed page are heavily weighted in that direction. There is also no question that The Times, though a national newspaper, shares the prevailing sensibilities of the city and region where it is published. It does not take creationism or intelligent design as serious alternatives to the theory of evolution. It prints the marriages and commitment ceremonies of same-sex couples. It covers art and cultural events out on the edge.
 But if The Times were really the Fox News of the left, how could you explain the investigative reporting that brought down Eliot Spitzer, New York's Democratic governor; derailed the election campaign of his Democratic successor, David Paterson; got Charles Rangel, the Harlem Democrat who was chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, in ethics trouble; and exposed the falsehoods that Attorney General Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, another Democrat, was telling about his service record in the Vietnam era?
 The Times is imperfect. As in any human institution, the 1,150 people in the newsroom make mistakes. But they get much, much more right than wrong. The miracle is that they don't make more mistakes, given the complexity of creating a daily, comprehensive news report on two platforms, the printed page and the Internet. Without The Times, which continues to invest heavily in news coverage around the world as others cut back drastically, we would all be poorer.
 Thank you all for the privilege of serving you. Now I look forward to the change. Instead of being paid to evaluate The Times, I can go back to savoring it -- as a reader.

HEADLINE: When Electric-Car Batteries Die, Where Will They End Up?

BYLINE: By DON SHERMAN

 BODY:
A DECADE from now, owners of electric cars, having driven their share of clean and green miles, may encounter a dashboard light flashing an unwelcome message: Check Battery. 
 Their first concern, quite likely, will be the expense of a new battery, which could be $10,000 or more based on today's prices, though production breakthroughs might lower costs by then.
 But ecoconscious drivers will soon turn to the matter of a final resting place for their worn-out batteries. A bulky 500-pound lithium-ion battery pack will never be a candidate for curbside recycling. And improper disposal would undo the good accrued through years of zero-emissions motoring.
 This situation is years away, of course. Few lithium-ion-powered cars are on the road, and estimates of the battery packs' lifespan -- no one knows for sure -- range upward from seven years. Even so, battery suppliers and electric utilities are already working to establish a recycling stream. 
 Among the organizations hoping to create an afterlife for batteries that are no longer fit for road use is a Washington-based trade group, the Rechargeable Battery Association, which calls itself PRBA. The stakes are high for such efforts. All of the parties are hoping to be seen as conscientious product stewards so that electric cars have a chance to thrive. As well, they want to wring every last bit of value from the batteries before their raw materials are finally processed for recovery.
 To grasp the good and bad of product stewardship, consider two common examples: tires and conventional lead-acid batteries. 
 Every year millions of worn-out tires are removed from America's cars. About a third are retreaded or recycled, but many end up abandoned and hundreds of millions are in storage awaiting the arrival of an economically feasible use. Tires are banned from most landfills because they are bulky and trap pockets of methane. Lacking a viable end use, the bald tire is a prime example of poor product stewardship.
 The gold standard of effective stewardship is the old-fashioned lead-acid car battery; according to the Battery Council International, a trade group based in Chicago, 97 percent of battery lead is recycled. In the last decade, major manufacturers like Exide Technologies have developed an infrastructure to minimize the chances of discarded batteries ending up in landfills. 
 ''Shops that install new batteries and save the old ones for pickup are paid about $10 per core,'' said Robert Hohman, a vice president at Complete Battery Source, a chain of retailers based in Brighton, Mich. 
 ''Recyclers shred the hard parts -- lead plates, plastic cases -- and capture the acid electrolyte,'' he said. ''Nearly all of the recovered material goes into new batteries.'' 
 The value of the metal in lead batteries, about 30 cents a pound according to Mr. Hohman, is in stark contrast to the value of the four pounds of lithium inside the 400-pound battery that will power the Chevrolet Volt on trips up to 40 miles. As a commodity, lithium currently costs about $2 a pound, probably not enough to warrant its recovery and reuse. 
 In the near term, many depleted electric car batteries will be processed by Toxco, a California-based division of the Kinsbursky Brothers. Established in 1984, Toxco is a leader in battery recycling with facilities in California, Ohio, Tennessee and British Columbia.
 The procedure currently used to recycle lithium-ion batteries at Toxco's facility in Trail, British Columbia, begins with a deep freeze to minus 325 degrees Fahrenheit to stop the chemical and electrical activity. After shearing and shredding, the metals, plastics and chemical compounds are separated for sale or disposal. A chemical reaction converts the lithium to lithium carbonate, which has multiple uses in medicine, as an industrial chemical and to give fireworks and flares their brilliant red glow.
 Last year, the Energy Department awarded Toxco $9.5 million to expand its Lancaster, Ohio, operations -- currently used to recycle nickel-cadmium, nickel-metal-hydride and lead-acid batteries -- to handle the expected influx of depleted lithium-ion batteries.
 But lithium batteries are not all doomed to a fate of dismemberment: electric car builders and battery makers say that when a battery pack is no longer able to provide full performance or driving range and a replacement is deemed necessary, three-quarters of its energy capacity remains. 
 That is why, in the longer term, electric utilities may be the answer to where electric car batteries will be put out to pasture. 
 One of the most daunting tasks faced by utilities is to coordinate the generation and supply of electricity with fluctuations of demand. Consumers come home from work and switch on big-screen televisions while dinner is in the oven. That behavior, repeated throughout the community, produces a spike in energy demand. Then, after the evening news, people tend to shut off their lights and appliances, and demand plummets. The net result is that power-plant efficiency suffers because generators are not operated at a steady output.
 Utilities already depend on buffers to level out supply and demand, pumping water into storage towers and compressed air into underground reservoirs as ways to manage generator usage. But with increased use of renewable -- but fickle -- energy sources like wind and solar, there's a growing need for storage devices that are not a blight on the landscape. 
 ''We've been watching electric car development for more than a decade,'' said Mike Rowand, a technology adviser to Duke Energy of North Carolina. ''The early batteries weren't that attractive, but we jumped in full-force three years ago because so many automakers were involved.'' 
 Southern California Edison has been promoting automobile electrification for two decades. 
 ''We're expecting electric vehicles to benefit not only the environment, but also to help the electric system work more effectively by absorbing some of the power produced in off-peak periods by wind generators,'' said Ted Craver Jr., chief executive of the utility's parent, Edison International. Mr. Craver said that his company operated the nation's largest fleet of electric vehicles, which had traveled over 18 million miles in the last 20 years.
 ''We've built what we call the garage of the future featuring roof-mounted solar panels, a SmartConnect electricity meter and storage batteries,'' he said. ''Second-life batteries -- those removed from road service -- would be ideal for this application.''
 Paul De Martini, vice president for advanced technology at Southern California Edison, said that 16 percent of the energy the utility delivered to customers already came from renewable sources -- wind, solar and hydroelectric. 
 ''This year, at one of our substations in the 
 Tehachapi Mountains where S.C.E. has numerous wind farms, we're creating a utility-scale installation with 32-megawatt-hours of storage capacity in an 8,000-square-foot building,'' he said. ''The lithium-ion batteries supplied by A123 will fill in the peaks and valleys of the power produced by the wind generators.
 Mr. De Martini added: ''We expect the second-life batteries to become available around 2025. That gives us ample time to develop new battery-management systems suited to our specific application. One designed by Tesla is already under test.''
 No one can say exactly how long lithium-ion batteries will last on the road or whether those removed from cars will compete favorably against next-generation batteries in the hoped-for utilities applications. 
 But there is a lot of optimism: General Motors has said it believes that post-auto uses will extend battery life by five to 10 years. Nissan has teamed with the Sumitomo Corporation to foster a second life for lithium-ion batteries removed from Nissan Leaf electric cars in a program called Reuse, Resell, Refabricate and Recycle. Custom repackaging to suit client needs is part of this business plan.

HEADLINE: Calling Ladies' Mile Home

BYLINE: By ALISON GREGOR

 BODY:
THE Ladies' Mile Historic District, which lies roughly between Union Square and Madison Square, from the east side of Broadway to the west side of Sixth Avenue, commemorates a series of women's shops and department stores that once marched up its avenues like civic monuments.
 Ladies' Mile is one of the few historic districts in the city that are not predominantly residential. But in the last decade the pace of residential conversions there has picked up, with hundreds of units coming on the market. The area's pedigree has become a selling point. 
 From the late 1860s until World War I, Ladies' Mile flourished as a retail center, and after the war it was home to distribution, warehousing and manufacturing operations, and ultimately white-collar offices. Many buildings have high ceilings and huge windows, making them ripe for conversion. 
 Sales began in 2007 at 650 Sixth Avenue, a condominium conversion that promised ''gallery living'' with its boxy white interiors. Of its 67 units, 20 were sold by August 2008. Three brokerages, two name changes and one big recession later, apartments are finally moving again at 650 Sixth, now called the Cammeyer. A new marketing campaign is emphasizing the building's history as part of Ladies' Mile.
 ''We said, why only focus on the interiors?'' said John Gomes, an exclusive sales agent for the CORE Group, which began selling the Cammeyer's apartments in March. ''We decided our focus would be from the outside inward,'' he said. ''We really celebrate the history of the building.''
 As part of its marketing campaign, CORE hired Joyce Gold, a Manhattan historian, to give tours of Ladies' Mile for real estate brokers, educating them about the stone-and-brick loft building at 650 Sixth Avenue and 20th Street, built in 1892 and owned by A. J. Cammeyer & Company, one of the largest shoe retailers in the country.
 After two months, CORE has 10 signed contracts for apartments at the Cammeyer and several contracts out, Mr. Gomes said. Prices range from $845,000, for a studio, to $3.25 million for the three-bedroom penthouse. 
 At the Beaux-Arts building at 141 Fifth Avenue, just north of 20th Street, which was once Merchants Bank of New York, the development group Savanna created 34 apartments, including a penthouse in the ornate cupola, which has a $12 million asking price. 
 Sales are averaging close to $1,700 a square foot, and only that penthouse and a few other units remain unsold, said Emily Beare, the director of sales and an executive vice president of CORE.
 Ms. Gold, who teaches at New York University, said that although Ladies' Mile was entirely commercial at first, the edifice built in 1884 by the Gorham Silver Company at 891 Broadway was innovative in that it had the silversmith's works downstairs and bachelor quarters, sans kitchens, upstairs.
 ''But by 1893 that building had gone completely commercial,'' Ms. Gold said. 
 No new residential development took place in the district until almost a century later, when Madison Green at 5 East 22nd Street, a 424-unit condominium on the district's edge, was built in 1982, Ms. Gold said. 
 ''They had an advertisement that I remember,'' she said. ''It said: 'Live across from the park -- you think we mean Central Park? No, we mean the elegant Madison Square Park.' So they really promoted the neighborhood.''
 In reality, it took Madison Square Park almost two decades to deliver fully on that promotion's promise. The Ladies' Mile Historic District, designated in 1989, underwent isolated attempts at residential conversion, as with the McIntyre Building at 874 Broadway in the 1970s, Ms. Gold said.
 But it wasn't until the past decade that Ladies' Mile began to experience more consistent movement toward residential. Notable conversions have included the Sohmer Piano Building at 170 Fifth Avenue, recognizable by its golden dome, and the O'Neill Building at 655 Sixth Avenue, with its own golden domes. 
 When Elad Properties bought the O'Neill, the domes didn't exist anymore, said Richard Cantor, a principal at Cantor-Pecorella, which sold almost the entire 49-unit building in about six weeks in 2005. ''So the domes that were put up there are obviously a facsimile,'' he said, ''but they really make the building distinctive.'' 
 Since 2000, scattered new residential development, made to look older, has also taken place, including the Caroline at 60 West 23rd Street and, more recently, the Emory at 27 West 19th Street.
 Ladies' Mile will gain a crucial missing element for residents, brokers said, once a Trader Joe's supermarket opens at 675 Sixth Avenue, though there is a Whole Foods on Seventh Avenue at 25th Street just outside the district. 
 ''In most residential neighborhoods, you take for granted your shoemaker, your cleaner, your market,'' Ms. Beare said. ''The big component missing here was a nice food place, so Trader Joe's and Limelight are amazing. It's much more convenient now.''

THE ICARUS SYNDROME
 A History of American Hubris
 By Peter Beinart
 482 pp. Harper/HarperCollins Publishers. $27.99
 For all their daily efforts to disembowel one another, American foreign policy experts agree on one thing: the United States needs a new, coherent and practical strategy for the 21st century. Peter Beinart's ''Icarus Syndrome: A History of American Hubris'' doesn't attain this policy nirvana. Still, it's a highly readable and useful hundred-year account of American ventures abroad that can serve as a path to understanding past failures and uncovering why policy renewal is now proving so elusive.
 Thomas L. Friedman tried to provide a new strategy by proclaiming in ''The World Is Flat'' that globalization had leveled power among strong and weak. But while he rightly concentrated on economics, he palpably misread a world where international power remains highly tiered. 
 The journalist Fareed Zakaria provocatively titled his book ''The Post-American World,'' which suggested the rise of a new era led by China and others. But in fact his text portrayed a world with America still on top, even if weaker than before. Zakaria was right to place Beijing and economics at the core of any new thinking, yet he offered no strategy for working with a China that now wants everything and offers little in return.
 In perhaps the most coherent of recent policy books, ''The Return of History and the End of Dreams,''Robert Kagan of the Carnegie Endowment correctly reminded Americans of the world's evils. But his answers fell back on neoconservative bromides about prevailing with greater will, more threats and superior military power, seemingly all in the service of promoting democracy.
 Beinart, a journalist and an associate professor at the City University of New York, shifts this search for a new strategy away from the international arena to American society and character. The source of the nation's foreign policy woes, he argues, lies not in the stars but in ourselves. His thesis is not new, but it is indefatigably rendered: America's shortcomings flow entirely from hubris or overconfidence, much as the mythical Icarus perished because he flew too near the sun.
 Beinart blames Woodrow Wilson's diplomatic failures on ''the hubris of reason'' -- the belief that a wise America could educate other nations into a permanent peace built on fairness and collective security, as opposed to self-interest. He goes on to chastise Lyndon Johnson for ''the hubris of toughness'' -- the misguided belief that ''through unyielding force America could halt Communism's march anywhere in the world.'' Finally, he clobbers George W. Bush for ''the hubris of dominance,'' an awkward phrase that he defines as ''the belief that America could make itself master of every important region on earth.''
 This is far too much historical water for any single concept to bear. Wilson's misconceptions sprang as much from idealism as from reason -- the same sort of idealism that today leads to foolish dreams about softening Islamic extremists with understanding and love. And while Johnson was seduced from time to time by toughness, that wasn't the main explanation for the escalation of the war in Vietnam. The United States fought because of a conviction that Vietnam was in danger of becoming the first of many Asian dominoes to fall to Communism. Domestic politics reinforced this notion: losing would be seen as weakness and would cause the fall of the ultimate domino -- the White House. Johnson was driven less by hubris than by a sense of being trapped: he felt he couldn't win and he couldn't get out.
 As for Bush's lunge into Iraq, he certainly believed he could vanquish a tin-horn dictator like Saddam Hussein. What drove him to battle, however, was a desire not simply to strut his power, but also to redress what he saw as his father's greatest mistake, letting Hussein survive the Persian Gulf war of 1991. Even more, the invasion flowed from Bush's view that Hussein was close to developing nuclear weapons. (It's worth mentioning that most foreign policy experts, including Beinart and me, did not dissent from this line of thinking.)
 In his devotion to the explanatory magic of hubris, Beinart touches on, but glides over, the dual nature of the American character, society and politics. Yes, overconfidence can result in excess. Yet its roots rest in the can-do spirit of Americans, a virtue that has led to great ventures like NATO and the Marshall Plan.
 Yes, ideology triggers bizarre commitments to bring democracy to countries run by corrupt and ineffective leaders. Yet American principles are also what drove Washington to prevent genocide in Bosnia and Kosovo, even as civilized Europeans averted their eyes. And yes, domestic politics have produced unconscionable losses in lives and treasure. Yet American democracy has always fixed itself and rebounded. So much of what is bad about the United States is the flip side of what is good about the United States. That is why America's demons -- dogmatic principles, self-destructive politics and the arrogance of power -- can never be eliminated, only juggled by great leaders.
 When Beinart shelves his Icarus metaphor, he usefully grapples with the practical impediments to making good policy. He explores how presidents have trapped themselves by exaggerating American power. John F. Kennedy pretended that Nikita Khrushchev removed Soviet missiles from Cuba without getting anything in return, when in truth the United States secretly agreed to remove missiles from Turkey. An artful compromise was presented as an outright unilateral triumph, which taught Americans a false lesson about the invincibility of toughness, rather than one about the limits of power.
 Beinart repeatedly points out the virtues of restraint. He notes that Dwight Eisenhower rejected the military's advice to try to win the Korean War and unify the peninsula. Instead, Eisenhower vaguely threatened the use of nuclear weapons and negotiated a truce. More broadly, both Harry Truman and Eisenhower strove to contain Communism without committing troops to combat, relying instead on covert operations, enhancing America's nuclear retaliatory threat and strengthening Western economies.
 Ronald Reagan followed suit, Beinart explains, refusing to spill American blood in El Salvador and Nicaragua, and pulling Marines out of Lebanon before that country exploded. He wound down the cold war by embracing cooperation over confrontation with Mikhail Gorbachev. ''Soviet Communism collapsed,'' Beinart writes, ''not because Reagan made America more frightening, but because he made it less so.''
 The first President Bush also treasured restraint. He refrained from ordering troops into Baghdad to unseat Hussein because he didn't want to assume responsibility for running an Arab country. Moreover, he wished to keep Iraq as a counterweight to Iran.
 In the end, Beinart can't resist exhuming Icarus one last time -- to great excess. He says that his book aims to help President Obama overcome ''the beautiful lie'' -- ''a series of assumptions about American omnipotence that, if not challenged, threatens to drive our foreign policy deeper into the red.'' Frankly, it's difficult to unearth even one serious foreign policy expert today who believes the United States is omnipotent. To me, the gravest danger is to assert the primacy of American economic renewal and then ignore the tough foreign and domestic choices that must attend this priority. To his credit, Beinart calls for a renewal of American schools, politics and economic vitality. But these good ideas dissipate in a haze of hubris.

HEADLINE: In Midlife, Boomers Are Happy -- And Suicidal

BYLINE: By PATRICIA COHEN

 BODY:
If you are suddenly feeling confused about whether to greet middle age with open arms or dread, it is understandable. In recent weeks, researchers reported that Americans in midlife are a remarkably contented lot, and that they also have the highest rate of suicide.
 So what is going on? Is middle age the best of times or the worst? 
 First, the positive side of the ledger. A new study of a Gallup telephone poll that essentially took a snapshot of how more than 340,000 respondents felt on a particular day in 2008 found that starting at age 50, there was a sharp rise in the level of happiness that people reported.
 Such findings seem to cause a frisson of surprise, even though for years now, in-depth studies have found that middle age is generally the happiest time of life for a majority of Americans.
 Perhaps a youth-obsessed culture has difficulty believing such tidings. Yet a study by Midlife in the United States, a research project run out of the Institute on Aging at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, concluded a decade ago that ''for most of us, at least some portion of the middle years may be the 'prime of life.' ''
 ''From many points of view, midlife permits many of us to feel on top of the world, in control of our lives, and well enough pleased with what we have accomplished to seek new outlets of both self-expression and giving back to society some of what we have earned -- and learned,'' the study said. Researchers surmised that while stresses about money and children are at a peak, so are competence and a sense of mastery.
 As for tales of midlife crisis, they are the equivalent of urban myths. The most anxiety-ridden years are the 20s and early 30s. Even adolescence and childhood tend to have more critical moments than midlife does. ''In everyday life,'' another midlife study found, ''the decade of the 40s is likely to be experienced as a time when material and emotional dreams are fulfilled.''
 Arthur A. Stone, the lead author of the new study based on the Gallup poll, suggested that changes in brain chemistry were also at work. Neuroscientists have shown that in younger adults, the amygdala, the brain's emotional nut, is activated when exposed to negative and positive input, whereas adults in their middle and upper decades seem to have the ability to screen out or tamp down negative emotions; their amygdalas light up when they see positive images, and they tune out the negative.
 The unexpected rise in middle-age suicide is more puzzling. The results of the latest federal Centers for Disease Control and Preventionsurvey of violent deaths in 16 states, released last month, found that in 2007, for the second year in a row, the group between ages 45 and 54 had the highest rate of suicide, a reverse of historical trends. Traditionally, people over 80 register the highest rates. Since 2003, though, rates for the elderly, and for 16- to 19-year-olds, another vulnerable group, have dipped.
 Dr. LaVonne Ortega, a medical epidemiologist at the C.D.C., said in an interview that she was reluctant to speculate about the age shift since so little was known about the circumstances surrounding these deaths.
 What we do know, Dr. Ortega said, is that the most common risk factors for suicide are mental illness, drug and alcohol abuse, and the loss of a job or partner. A sickly economy has been associated with a rise in suicide, although these most recent figures, from 2006 and 2007, are from before the depth of the recession.
 There has, however, been a tenfold increase in the use of prescription opioid painkillers like oxycodone in the past 15 years, caused by a shift toward more aggressive pain management. This large upswing is linked to a jump in accidental drug overdoses, particularly among 45- to 54-year-olds. The increased drug use might be related to suicide rates, Dr. Ortega said. Given that suicide rates among middle-aged Americans have been rising for five years, Dr. Ortega said, ''we anticipate that the trend might continue.''
 Myrna Weissman, an epidemiologist at the New York State Psychiatric Institute, offers a more intriguing theory. She believes that the baby boom generation has a higher incidence of depression than previous ones. Dr. Weissman, who first published her theory more than 20 years ago, said, ''We did predict in 1989 that there could be an increase in suicide attempts and suicide as that cohort, which was showing very high rates of depression, aged.''
 Asked why boomers would be particularly vulnerable, Dr. Weissman speculated: ''That's a cohort that came to maturity when there were great social changes, more instability, more divorce and separation, more moves, an increase in drug use, and war.'' As for those happy midlifers? ''They're different people,'' she said with a laugh, ''less vulnerable and subjected less to these adverse life effects.''
 Dr. Eric C. Caine, co-director at the Center for the Study and Prevention of Suicide at the University of Rochester Medical Center, agreed that the postwar generation was big enough to contain the happiest and the most desperate.
 ''Both can be true,'' he said. ''You can argue that at this time of life there is a lot of satisfaction, but this population is so large, you can still find those who don't fit that profile.''
 He complained that all of the theories were gropes in the dark. ''People put a tremendous amount of research and prevention into youth and elders,'' he said, but when it comes to suicide, those in middle age have been ignored.
 Nonetheless, Dr. Caine, like Robert M. Bossarte, a colleague at the medical center, is skeptical about the boomer theory. Dr. Bossarte thinks that there may be some kind of transition that middle-aged people are experiencing that researchers have not yet picked up on. Just as the danger of injury and death leaps up at ages 16 and 17 as teenagers indulge in riskier behaviors, he said, there may be something similar going on in the 45-to-54 age group.
 Additional stresses may be hitting people in middle age, for example, like the double burden of caring for children and for aging parents whose lifespans are increasing.
 Despite the boomer's penchant for seeing himself as the exception, Dr. Bossarte said, ''I don't think it is likely that this population has some unique risk factor.''
 This may be one case where the boomer generation is glad to hear that it is not exceptional.

HEADLINE: No Closing Time For Income Taxes

BYLINE: By DANIEL OKRENT. 
Daniel Okrent, a former public editor of The Times, is the author of ''Last Call: The Rise and Fall of Prohibition.''

 BODY:
ON March 19, 1928, eight years into the reign of constitutional Prohibition, Pierre S. du Pont wrote a letter to William P. Smith, one of the very few people he ever addressed by first name. Du Pont was among the wealthiest men in the world, chairman of both his family's chemical colossus and the du Pont-controlled General Motors Corporation. Smith worked for a less well-known enterprise that Pierre du Pont also dominated: the Association Against the Prohibition Amendment.
 ''The object of the organization,'' du Pont told his friend Bill, ''is not merely the return of the use of alcoholic beverages in the United States.'' He went on, ''Another important factor is the tremendous loss of revenue to our government through the Prohibition laws'' -- the revenue once collected through taxes on liquor and beer. With the end of Prohibition, he wrote, ''the revenue of the government would be increased sufficiently to warrant the abolition of the income tax and corporation tax.'' 
 For today's advocates of legalized, taxable marijuana -- or new levies on, say, electricity use, baseball tickets or high-fructose corn syrup -- it's an appealing model. Some even believe that a tax on marijuana, which could be legalized by California voters this November, could lead to a reduction in the state's income taxes. But the history of the intimate relationship between drinking and taxing suggests otherwise. 
 The link between the two is as old as the Republic; Alexander Hamilton provoked the Whiskey Rebellion when he persuaded Congress in 1791 to enact the first federal tax on liquor to help pay down the national debt. By 1910, as anti-alcohol forces were making a significant impact on American politics, the federal government was annually drawing more than 70 percent of its domestic revenue from the bottle and the keg. In those years before the advent of the income tax, only the tariff on foreign goods and materials provided a larger share.
 The nation's dependence on the alcohol tax created a vexing problem for the leaders of the Prohibition movement. As early as 1883, the editors of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union's official newspaper coyly asked their readers, ''How, then, will [we] support the government'' if the sale of liquor is prohibited? 
 The editors had a ready answer: an income tax, they wrote, was ''the most just and equable arrangement ever made for the equalization of governmental burdens.'' In 1895, the Prohibition Party recognized that an excise tax ''is a pledge on the part of the state to defend and foster the thing taxed,'' and it soon nailed an income tax plank to its platform. And leaders of the most powerful Dry organization, the Anti-Saloon League, grumpily aware of what one called the ''alleged 'loss of revenue' argument,'' chose to focus most of its attention on state-by-state, rather than federal, prohibitory laws.
 But the league also encouraged the populist campaign to authorize an income tax. When this support finally bore fruit in 1913, the organization announced that ''the adoption of the Income Tax Amendment to the federal Constitution furnishes an answer to the revenue problem.'' As a result, it said, the time had come for all foes of alcohol to put aside the state-by-state strategy and focus on a new goal. ''National prohibition,'' its executive committee declared, ''can be secured through the adoption of a constitutional amendment.'' By 1920, it was law.
 Through the first nine years of Prohibition, income taxes went a long way toward covering the federal government's costs. But just as organized Drys had backed the income tax in 1913 in order to breathe life into Prohibition, a du Pont-led group of well-financed Wets would eventually seek to kill Prohibition so that the income tax might die with it. 
 The idea had first emerged in 1923, when the publisher of The Wall Street Journal, Clarence W. Barron, argued that ending Prohibition would enable the government to collect $2 billion a year and abolish the income tax. In 1926, Pierre du Pont's brother Irenee told an associate that General Motors would save $10 million in corporate taxes each year with the return of the alcohol levies. Irenee's specific solution -- imposition of a 3-cent tax on every glass of beer -- would, effectively, make the working poor and the unemployed finance tax relief for the rich. 
 These plutocratic longings began to take palpable form when prosperity was upended by the Crash of 1929. The Depression corroded tax collections: federal revenue based on 1930 incomes was down 15 percent, the following year saw a 37 percent drop, and the year after that 26 percent -- a vertiginous 60 percent collapse in just three years. Capital gains taxes that had brought $1.5 billion into the Treasury from 1926 to 1929 dived into negative territory as the allowance for capital losses accrued. At the same time, the demand for government spending -- for relief, for reconstruction projects, for anything to restart the comatose economy -- soared. 
 By 1930, the chemical du Ponts had recruited a roster of other gilt-edged names to their anti-Prohibition cause: automotive Fishers, financial Harrimans, oil Harknesses, rubber Goodriches. Their publicity campaign featured pamphlets like ''What Price Prohibition?'' (Answer: with the return of legal alcohol, ''the necessity of levying income taxes would be eliminated'') and ''The Cost of Prohibition and Your Income Tax.''
 By 1932, as the Depression plunged toward its devastating nadir, a new handout from the Association Against the Prohibition Amendment spoke more urgently to the historical moment: ''The Need of a New Source of Government Revenue.'' The authors didn't have to look far to identify one, as Pierre du Pont made clear in a radio address that summer. ''The income tax would not be necessary in the future,'' he said, ''and half the revenue required for the budget ... would be furnished by the tax on liquor alone.''
 That message was for public consumption; privately, he was even more direct. ''The Repeal of the XVIIIth Amendment would permit federal taxation in the amount of $2 billion,'' du Pont wrote to a relative in April 1932, by which time the congenitally Republican industrialist had become an ardent supporter of the pro-repeal Franklin Roosevelt. ''Such taxation would almost eliminate the income taxes of corporations and individuals.''
 He didn't have to wait long to see if he was right. The repeal amendment was ratified on Dec. 5, 1933, just nine months after Roosevelt's inauguration, and new tax revenues began to flow. In the first post-repeal year, the government collected $259 million from the alcohol excise -- instantly, nearly 9 percent of total federal revenue -- even though many states either remained dry or severely limited the sale of alcohol. 
 Unfortunately for du Pont, the other half of his equation didn't work out. Roosevelt and Congress did respond to the repeal windfall by cutting income tax rates for workers earning less than $3,000 a year. But the New Deal had little sympathy for the wealthy, whose taxes actually increased over the next few years. Rather than the trade-off du Pont expected, the government used the excise income to expand. 
 ''I acknowledge my mistake,'' du Pont wrote in 1936, after he and many of his colleagues had transferred their energies and financial support to the rabidly anti-Roosevelt American Liberty League. ''The effort should have been directed against the XVIth Amendment'' -- the income tax amendment -- ''which I believe could have been repealed with the expenditure of less time and trouble than was required for the abolition of its little brother,'' the 18th.
 Prohibition had been dead for three years, but the damnable taxes Pierre du Pont had expected to die with it lived on. Contemporary Californians indulging a fantasy of income tax relief emerging from a cloud of legalized marijuana smoke should realize that it is likely only a pipe dream.

HEADLINE: Long Road to Adulthood Is Growing Even Longer

BYLINE: By PATRICIA COHEN

 BODY:
Baby boomers have long been considered the generation that did not want to grow up, perpetual adolescents even as they become eligible for Social Security. Now, a growing body of research shows that the real Peter Pans are not the boomers, but the generations that have followed. For many, by choice or circumstance, independence no longer begins at 21.
 From the Obama administration's new rule that allows children up to age 26 to remain on their parents' health insurance to the large increase in the number of women older than 35 who have become first-time mothers, social scientists say young adulthood has undergone a profound shift.
 People between 20 and 34 are taking longer to finish their educations, establish themselves in careers, marry, have children and become financially independent, said Frank F. Furstenberg, who leads the MacArthur Foundation Research Network on Transitions to Adulthood, a team of scholars who have been studying this transformation. 
 ''A new period of life is emerging in which young people are no longer adolescents but not yet adults,'' Mr. Furstenberg said.
 National surveys reveal that an overwhelming majority of Americans, including younger adults, agree that between 20 and 22, people should be finished with school, working and living on their own. But in practice many people in their 20s and early 30s have not yet reached these traditional milestones.
 Marriage and parenthood -- once seen as prerequisites for adulthood -- are now viewed more as lifestyle choices, according to a new report released by Princeton University and the Brookings Institution.
 The stretched-out walk to independence is rooted in social and economic shifts that started in the 1970s, including a change from a manufacturing to a service-based economy that sent many more people to college, and the women's movement, which opened up educational and professional opportunities.
 Women account for more than half of college students and nearly half of the work force, which in turn has delayed motherhood and marriage.
 Dr. Dora Hughes, 39, married last year and is pregnant with her first child. Dr. Hughes, who works for the Department of Health and Human Services in Washington, said she did not finish her education until she was 30, and so had always expected to marry later on in life. Most of her friends from college waited until their late 20s or 30s to marry as well, she said.
 Dr. Hughes, who grew up in Chattanooga, Tenn., said, ''My parents got married when they were 24, and my mother always said she thought marriage was hard work and thought it was better for women to wait till their 30s.''
 ''That probably did have an influence,'' she added, since her mother always encouraged her to get an education and have a career.
 For the first time, a majority of mothers, 54 percent, have a college education, up from 41 percent in 1990. ''That is a huge change,'' said Andrew J. Cherlin, a professor of sociology and public policy at Johns Hopkins University.
 The median age for a first marriage was 23 in 1980; now it is 27 for men and 26 for women, the highest on record. A recent report by the Pew Research Center found that in the past two decades, a broad trend toward delaying motherhood that stretches across all races and ethnic and income groups has also taken hold.
 ''I was struck by the fact it increased in all ethnic groups,'' said D'Vera Cohn, a co-author of the report, adding that it was evidence of the strength and breadth of this transformation in the life cycles of Americans.
 For many, marriage has disappeared as a definition of traditional adulthood, as more and more younger people live together. Today 40 percent of births are to unmarried mothers, an increase from 28 percent in 1990.
 At the same time, more women are remaining childless, either by choice or circumstance. Twenty percent of women in their 40s do not have children, Mr. Furstenberg said, pointing out that ''not having children would have been considered bizarre or tragic in the '50s; now it's a lifestyle choice.''
 Laura Tisdel, 28, who grew up in Detroit, said, ''I figured I'd either get married in college or right after and basically be a smart mother.''
 Instead Ms. Tisdel ended up getting a job offer in publishing in New York City. She said she came close to marrying when she was 23, but then realized, ''I wasn't only not ready to get married to this guy, but I wasn't ready to get married at all.''
 She recently got engaged. Her grandparents thought she was a ''lesbian spinster'' for waiting so long, she said, while her New York friends think she is too young to be marrying. Her parents, 53-year-old baby boomers who met at 14 and married at 21, told her not to be in a rush.
 ''The longer I waited to get married, the more reticent I became,'' she said. She and her fiance want children, but feel they are not yet ready. ''We're both nervous about what would be lost,'' she said.
 More schooling has meant that children have to rely on financial support from their parents. Adults between 18 and 34 received an average of $38,000 in cash and two years' worth of full-time labor from their parents, or about 10 percent of their income, according to the MacArthur network.
 Figures on how much parents spent 20 or 30 years ago are scarce, but Mr. Furstenberg said new research that he and a colleague, Sabino Kornrich, are working on shows that ''prior to the 1990s, parents appeared to invest most in children in their teen years.
 In the late 1990s, however, parents' spending patterns began to shift so that the flow of money was greatest when their children were either very young or in their mid-20s.''
 More people in their 20s are also living with their parents. About one-fourth of 25-year-old white men lived at home in 2007 -- before the latest recession -- compared with one-fifth in 2000 and less than one-eighth in 1970.
 The sizable contribution from parents not only strains already stressed middle-class and poor families, researchers argue, but could also affect institutions that have traditionally supported young adults in this period, like nonresidential and community colleges and national service programs.
 ''We have not developed and strengthened institutions to serve young adults,'' Mr. Furstenberg said, ''because we're still living with the archaic idea that people enter adulthood in their late teens or early 20s.''

CORRECTION-DATE: June 20, 2010

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Because of an editing error, an article last Sunday about young adults' taking longer to become financially independent misspelled the surname of a sociologist who is researching parental spending on children. He is Sabino Kornrich, not Kornich.

HEADLINE: Florida Skipped Oil Binge, but Faces Hangover

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE; DuWayne Escobedo contributed reporting from Pensacola, and Gary Fineout from Tallahassee.

 BODY:
KEY LARGO, Fla. -- When rigs first started drilling for oil off Louisiana's coast in the 1940s, Floridians scanned their shoreline, with its resorts and talcum-white beaches, and said, No thanks. Go ahead and drill, they told other Gulf Coast states; we'll stick with tourism.
 Now that invisible wall separating Florida from its neighbors has been breached. The spreading BP oil spill has already reached the Panhandle, and if it rides currents to the renowned reefs and fishing holes on both Florida coasts, the Sunshine State could become a vacation destination with the rules of a museum: Look, but don't touch. 
 All because other states decided to rely on oil and gas, angry Floridians say; all because, in the water, there are no borders -- only currents that can carry catastrophes hundreds of miles. 
 ''There's nothing we can do,'' said Mike McLaughlin, 42, while stretching tanned shark skin on a dock here in the Keys. ''We're just sitting here, waiting for it all to disappear.''
 Many Floridians, of course, say they are heartbroken for Louisiana, and they still reserve their most caustic criticism for BP and government regulators. 
 But with oil continuing to gush from a well off Louisiana, Florida has grown angrier at its oil-friendly neighbors. Gov. Charlie Crist said in an interview last week that ''there's a certain level of frustration'' with the fact that Florida gets little if any financial benefit from offshore drilling, even though it shares the environmental risks. 
 On docks and beaches, many Floridians are less measured, and compare Louisiana to a neighbor with a bonfire that has set their block ablaze. 
 To some extent, it is a conflict set up by history. Louisiana and Florida may share the Gulf of Mexico, but they are essentially oil opposites. 
 Ever since World War II, when tar balls washed ashore across the gulf after German U-boats sank Allied oil tankers, Florida officials have held drilling at bay with state laws and lobbying in Washington to protect their state's bustling tourism industry. 
 Louisiana, meanwhile, is an oil state through and through that discovered its first commercial deposits in 1901 and started drilling offshore in 1947. 
 State officials have never looked back, and the resulting divide between the two states is now economic as well as cultural: oil and gas contribute about $65 billion a year to the Louisiana economy, according to the state's oil and gas association, while in Florida, tourism accounts for about $60 billion. 
 The difference, Floridians now note, is that a crowded bar in Miami has no impact on New Orleans. Oil spills are a different story. 
 Sean Snaith, an economist at the University of Central Florida, recently completed a study showing that Florida's gulf coast could lose 195,000 jobs and $11 billion this year alone if the spill cuts tourism in half. 
 With oil drilling -- as with Wall Street -- ''there will be significant rethinking about who benefits and who bears the cost,'' Mr. Snaith predicted. 
 Florida has a lot to lose, even beyond tourism and fishing. Housing has become increasingly concentrated along the state's 8,436 miles of shoreline. With property values already down by a third in many areas and unemployment around 12 percent, the state could see its economy darkened for a decade by the spill. 
 Also vulnerable is the third-largest reef system in the world, which sits just offshore in the likely path of the loop current that, according to oceanographers,has already sent small blots of oil around Florida's tip. 
 Residents worry about losing not just their livelihood, but also their way of life.
 Fishermen motor out every day from docks all over the Keys searching for mahi mahi or lobster when the season opens in August, leaving early in the morning for that blissful moment when the sun rises over an open sea. 
 Boat-dwellers like Paul Peterson, 57, who piloted his 21-foot sailboat here from Massachusetts nine years ago, can hardly imagine being told that the water is off limits, or that the fish are too toxic to eat. 
 Mr. Peterson has been fighting Stage 4 lymphoma for years. He wears a gold necklace with a coin pulled from a local shipwreck, and he says the memories of diving -- especially a few years back ''with a great gal from Colorado'' -- have kept him going. 
 ''It's a hard fight,'' said Mr. Peterson, referring to his cancer with the dropped r's of New England. ''And this place is so beautiful that it would be a sin. I don't even want to say it or think about it.'' 
 Many of his neighbors are still angry about how the cable news networks publicized the appearance of tar balls in Key West on May 17, tar balls that were not actually from the spill, leading some experts to surmise that they may have come from a ship. 
 Indeed, Florida is already learning that perception can define reality. Key Largo hosted a ''reef fest'' for divers last week, but after an extensive advertising campaign estimated to have reached 1.5 million people, only six divers showed up. Jackie Harder, president of the local chamber of commerce, said she had expected 300.
 Charter boat captains and diving instructors are also struggling. In previous years, they would usually have had bookings for much of July by now. But next month is wide open for old-timers like Skip Bradeen, 67, who said he had never seen it this bad in his 40 years of taking amateurs out to land the big one. 
 What really worries most fishermen and environmental scientists are the long-term consequences if oil is carried around the coast of Florida, with plumes underwater and slicks onshore. 
 ''It's untold billions of babies of fish and lobsters and crabs,'' said Douglas N. Rader, chief ocean scientist for the Environmental Defense Fund, an advocacy group. ''A wide array of seafood that is in the surface layers of the sea are transferred through the superhighway of the loop current and are depending on the habitats affected by the oil.''
 Gary Sands, a third-generation fisherman who works just past the Pilot House bar here in Key Largo, took a break on a hot morning of hammering together lobster traps to explain exactly what that means. 
 Sitting a few dozen yards from where Mr. McLaughlin stretched his shark skins, Mr. Sands pointed to a pair of blond teenagers, the sons of a fellow fisherman. 
 ''I'm 68, but these boys, they've got 30 years,'' he said. ''If it doesn't come back for these boys, what's going to happen?''
 Albert Pflueger, 50, another fisherman, whose family once owned the largest taxidermy company in South Florida, pondered the question. Across the docks sat a boat named What Next. Removing his sunglasses, Mr. Pflueger said he could imagine the Keys emptying out like an abandoned mining town. 
 ''The whole Keys makes its living on the water,'' he said. ''If there is no water, there is no Keys.''

HEADLINE: Financial Uncertainty Restores Glitter to an Old Refuge, Gold

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
It is the resurgent passion of the doomsday crowd, a bet that everything will go wrong. No matter what has you worried, they say, the answer is gold. 
 Inflation, deflation, government borrowing or the plunging euro -- you name it -- the specter of these concerns has set off a dash to gold, driving the precious metal to new highs and illustrating how fears of economic turmoil have moved from the fringe to the mainstream.
And gold bugs, often dismissed as crackpots who hoard gold bars in the basement, are finally having their day. 
 ''I just think you're in a world where a lot of chickens are coming home to roost,'' said John Hathaway, manager of the Tocqueville Gold fund. ''Gold is an escape hatch.'' 
 The most visible new gold enthusiasts range from the Fox News commentator Glenn Beck on the right to the financier George Soros on the left, with even some sober-minded Wall Street types developing a case of gold fever. While their language may differ, they share a fundamental view that the age-old refuge of gold is relevant again, especially as other assets like stocks and national currencies show signs of weakness. 
 Now, individual investors are following their example around the world. The United States Mint is running short of gold coins, and the South African mint increased Krugerrand production by 50 percent late last month, to its highest level in 25 years, on brisk European demand.
 The debt crisis in Europe and the ensuing drop in the value of the euro are the most recent catalysts for gold's spike last week to $1,254 an ounce, a record before adjusting for inflation, but the deeper concern is that even in the United States, government borrowing is unsustainable and the day of reckoning is at hand. Sales of American Eagle one-ounce gold coins tripled in May from the month before.
 If governments print more money to pay off their debts, the logic goes, inflation will destroy the value of the dollar, the euro and other paper currencies -- thus enhancing the value of gold. What is more, with tax increases unlikely and with Europe on the brink, the unthinkable -- a sovereign debt default or the collapse of the credit system -- has suddenly become thinkable.
 To be sure, gold buyers have always been motivated by fear. What has changed is that some of the most respected investors on Wall Street are now among the fearful.
 ''In recent years, we have gone from one bubble and bailout to the next,'' David Einhorn, a New York money manager who was among the first to foretell the failure of Lehman Brothers, said in a speech last month. ''Our gold position reflects our concern that our fiscal and monetary policies are not sufficiently geared toward heading off a possible crisis.''
 Since ancient times, gold has been deemed intrinsically valuable, holding its worth even as governments fell and currencies collapsed, while seemingly casting a spell on its owners. 
 Still, gold can go down -- sometimes sharply. After peaking in 1980 at more than $800 an ounce, gold sank over the next two decades, bottoming out at just over $250 an ounce in 1999. But unlike paper assets that can become worthless, gold always retains at least some value. 
 These days, gold is also something of a political Rorschach test. On conservative talk radio, opposition to the Obama administration's economic policies and warnings that huge budget deficits will set off runaway inflation have made gold a hot topic of on-air discussion -- and lured gold companies as advertisers.
 Tongue only half in cheek, Glenn Beck advised his audience to consider ''Gold, God and Guns,'' while laying out three possible scenarios for the economy: recession, depression or collapse.
 One major advertiser on Mr. Beck's show is Goldline, a huge California marketer of gold coins and bars that is also a sponsor of programs hosted by other prominent conservative commentators like Laura Ingraham and Mike Huckabee. Mr. Beck has said he ''was a client of Goldline long before they were a client of mine,'' adding: ''I personally don't buy gold as an investment. I buy it for protection.''
 Of course, the right hardly has a monopoly on gold. Mr. Soros, a prominent donor to liberal causes and candidates, holds more than $600 million in bullion and gold mining shares. 
 Even as worries about the global economy have intensified, gold has become easier to buy. 
 Although some people still regard bars of gold in a vault as the ultimate insurance policy, exchange-traded funds, or E.T.F.'s, that hold gold have exploded in popularity in recent years. Gold E.T.F.'s, which trade like stocks but track the price of physical gold, account for 1,856 tons of gold, up from less than 500 tons in 2005, according to Credit Suisse. 
 Besides luring individual investors, these funds have also made gold more appealing to hedge funds and other institutions, allowing them to own vast amounts of gold without the burden of having to store it.
 John A. Paulson, a top New York hedge fund manager who earned billions betting against subprime mortgages, holds $3 billion worth of gold E.T.F.'s, making gold the largest single position in his $35 billion portfolio. 
 Daniel J. Arbess, who manages more than $2 billion in Perella Weinberg's Xerion fund, is another new gold lover. A few years ago, he said, he would not have taken a second look at gold as an investment. But now Mr. Arbess, a Harvard Law graduate and a generally conservative investor, is very serious about gold.
 Spiraling deficits in the United States, Japan and Britain are unsustainable, he said, and could eventually hurt confidence in what are called ''fiat currencies'' -- paper money not backed by gold, including the United States dollar. 
 ''Indebted countries may soon be forced to choose among three politically difficult alternatives: sharp cuts in expenditures, debt default or printing money to pay off debt,'' he said, with the last option the most likely outcome. Gold, he said, is a logical hedge against this risk, because firing up the printing presses ignites inflation.
 True believers note that gold has risen in each of the last nine years, and that while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is down 13 percent since 2001, gold is now worth nearly five times what it was then.
 For all its newfound respectability, gold still manages to bring out the inner survivalist in its adherents. Gold bugs like Peter Schiff of the investment firm Euro Pacific Capital in Westport, Conn., envision a black market arising in the United States, with merchants refusing paper money and insisting on gold instead, while Mr. Hathaway, the gold fund manager, says the credit system has entered ''the end game.''
 ''People probably still think I'm nuts,'' Mr. Hathaway said. ''But I'm not talking to myself in an isolation chamber anymore. We've got company now.''

HEADLINE: The Sun Rises in the West

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- The West may not be the geographic center of the country, but these days it sits at the heart of its political culture.
 Last week, California voters, fed up with primaries that produce polarizing candidates, chose a new system in which the top two vote-getters of a primary race -- no matter their party -- face off in the general election. In its primary on Tuesday, Nevada set the stage for the ultimate test of what voters can tolerate least -- Democratic incumbents or right-of-mainstream upstarts. The national conversation about immigration -- one that had been marginalized nationally and avoided in Washington -- has been restarted, and reframed, in Arizona over the last month.
 The marriage of the region's political volatility and its historical relationship to some of the toughest issues being pondered nationwide -- immigration, natural resources and energy, the appropriate reach of federal government -- have made it a mirror held up to the current political psyche. 
 ''These states are emerging as the new Missouri,'' said Robert Lang, the director of Brookings Mountain West, a research institution at the University of Las Vegas, Nevada. Western states, specifically Arizona, Nevada and New Mexico, ''read the national mood on issues like energy and other things that are going to matter in the country in the coming years,'' Mr. Lang said. ''It is just a sensitive spot to register the nation's fate, the national mood and our leaders.''
 Tea Party? Nevada has that movement's most quintessential candidate in a Senate contender, Sharron Angle, and an equally symbolic opponent in the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid.
 Economic crisis? Arizona, Nevada and California were among the hardest-hit states in the country and have yet to recover.
 Even the boom in female candidates for statewide office is reflected here: California Republicans are trying to make history by electing the state's first female governor and the state party's first female senator.
 As with any exciting stew, the rise of the West's role in the national political consciousness features many ingredients: history, demographics, physical landscape and local economies.
 Westerners, schooled in the whims of the federal government, which owns vast amounts of land here, and whose defense industry has historically been tied to the fortunes of California, Arizona and Colorado, have long been suspicious of government intrusions, long before the libertarian Rand Paul, the Republican Senate candidate in Kentucky, found a microphone.
 Yet the region has been and remains less fixed in its political traditions than broad regional swaths elsewhere in America. It has many nonpartisan mayors and city managers, and legislatures often take a back seat to direct democracy through ballot initiatives. It generally lacks strong unions that direct races. Nevada, New Mexico and Colorado are true swing states now.
 It has produced its fair share of political iconoclasts as well -- from Ronald Reagan to Jerry Brown. As such, the region has often been viewed as aberrational by the rest of the country, as both too physically detached and too quirky in its political doings.
 Western exceptionalism has extended to policy, too. California has often come before the rest of the country on proscriptive policy for health care and other issues. And the West has embraced the outer edges: proposed marijuana legalization (California), expanded gun rights (Arizona) and legal prostitution (Nevada).
 In recent years, Democrats and Republicans have sought to lock up the West for their parties to better ensure their own power in presidential elections. The opening for both parties to woo new voters in the region stems in large part from demographics and migration. From 2000 to 2009, the population of Nevada grew 32 percent, according to census figures, largely in the southern half of the state. Arizona grew 28 percent and Colorado, 17 percent, still twice the national average for that time period.
 ''States with static populations tend to have static politically allegiances,'' said Dan Schnur, director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at the University of Southern California. States in the Mountain and Pacific time zones have had some of the greatest population growth of the last 20 years, he said, ''and it's only natural that a newly arrived resident isn't going to have the same political loyalties as someone whose great-great-grandparents signed the Declaration of Independence.''
 In Nevada in 2007, Democrats began an attempt to become an early caucus state by constructing massive party infrastructure. The party built field operations statewide, even in places generally hostile to Democrats, and made use of southern Nevada, the one area where unions had begun to amass political power. By the time of the general election, the state had flipped, in terms of voter registration, from red to blue.
 ''Democrats figured they have lost the South so they need the West,'' said Jon Ralston, a veteran political columnist for The Las Vegas Sun. ''Reid changed the voter registration numbers even beyond what his wildest dreams were.''
 But the rural north of the state remains a conservative stronghold, and the state's politically libertarian culture is offended by the Obama administration's spending programs.
 And so it is that Mr. Reid, the architect of Democratic growth in his state, is now vulnerable to Ms. Angle, who has expressed support for the privatization of Medicare and Social Security and a desire to eliminate the Department of Education, positions that many independents and disenchanted Democrats may struggle to accept. ''In the last election, Nevada really did function as a bellwether,'' said Mr. Lang of Brookings Mountain West. ''And if you are really a true swing state, you would be going the other way right now. So they are.''
 If Americans are paying more attention to the West, it may be because many issues on their minds have been pondered here for decades. A position on Arizona's new immigration law, which requires the police to ask about the immigration status of people stopped for violations of the law, has become the litmus test among many G.O.P. primary candidates. President Obama, who has tried not to be dragged into an immigration debate in an election year, was forced to meet with Gov. Jan Brewer of Arizona to discuss their disagreement over the law.
 ''If you think about some of the big issues of the day,'' said Matthew J. Burbank, associate professor of political science at the University of Utah, ''energy, the environment, how you deal with population growth and scarce resources, particularly water -- those are issues that are really in many ways central to the West. They are really part of the national discussion now, especially what is going on with the gulf. Immigration is another good example.''
 How long the West will maintain dominance in the political conversation is a matter of some debate. Much of the argument centers on immigration and the economy. Over the last two years, population growth in Arizona and Nevada -- migration from other states as well as illegal immigration -- has slowed greatly, largely because the dominant industries, construction and tourism, have collapsed.
 Hispanics constitute more than 25 percent of the population of Arizona, Nevada and California, according to the Pew Hispanic Center. While they have low voter participation relative to other residents of those states, their potential power is not lost on either party. Republicans have been split over the Arizona law largely because they do not want to alienate Latinos.
 ''One of the big questions in this state is, 'Are you going to be able to see the voting intensity among Hispanics that you saw in 2008?' '' said Mr. Ralston of Nevada, who pointed to the eight Hispanic legislative contenders in his state, all favored to win. ''This place is absolutely still a work in progress.''

 Quanah Parker and the Rise and Fall of the Comanches, the Most Powerful Indian Tribe in American History

 Why does Custer persist? Nearly 134 years after his last stand, a military debacle that cost the lives of all 210 men under his immediate command, George Armstrong Custer remains such an iconic figure in the American pageant that mere mention of his name evokes an entirely overromanticized era in the American West. By all rights he should be a footnote. That he enjoys the glory of single-name recognition is a testament to the power of personality, show business and savvy public relations. Custer wasn't just an Indian fighter. He was one of the first self-made American celebrities.
 In ''The Last Stand,'' Nathaniel Philbrick, the author of the popular histories ''Mayflower'' and ''In the Heart of the Sea,'' offers an account of the Battle of the Little Bighorn that gives appropriate space to Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse, Maj. Marcus Reno and others who fought that day. But really, Custer steals the show. 
 How could he not? The man was a spectacular piece of work. Ambitious and charismatic, he graduated last in his West Point class but first in socializing. During the Civil War, he emerged as one of the best cavalry officers in the Union Army. His gallant Gettysburg charge (''Come on, you Wolverines!'' he shouted to his Michigan volunteers) helped change the course of the battle that turned the tide of the war.
 Even as a young officer Custer cultivated a flamboyant public persona. He fought at Gettysburg in a black velvet uniform (of his own design) embroidered with gaudy gold lace coils. After the war, when he turned his energies to fighting Indians on the Great Plains, he outfitted himself in fringed white buckskin and wore his hair long.
 He was a gambler, a probable adulterer, a braggart, a petulant boss and an impulsive blabbermouth. His eccentricity tilted toward stupidity. He once divided up his regiment according to color. Horse color. As you might expect, he wasn't especially beloved by the troops. ''I had known General Custer . . . for a long time,'' one of his officers once testified, ''and I had no confidence in his ability as a soldier.''
 What he did have was boldness and fortune on his side, up to a point. A force of fate that he himself called ''Custer luck'' propelled him up the ranks, and his risk-taking strategies secured an important victory over the Cheyenne in 1868. Custer imagined the 1876 campaign against Sitting Bull's Lakota Sioux as the capstone to his brilliant military career. If all went well he hoped to ride back East as the hero Indian fighter in time for the nation's July 4, 1876, centennial celebration and a scheduled lecture tour. Custer, then 36, entertained serious notions of running for president one day. Given his personal charisma and genius for publicity, he might well have won.
 All did not go well, of course. The Lakota conflict began with an old-fashioned land grab inflamed by Custer himself. The Black Hills in present-day South Dakota were declared Indian land in the late 1860s, but white settlers began encroaching by the early 1870s. Custer, sent to investigate, instead escalated things by discovering gold in the Black Hills. News of his find flooded the region with 15,000 white prospectors. At this point, ''Custer luck'' starts to look more like ''Clouseau luck,'' and it's hard not to imagine the commander in chief, President Ulysses S. Grant, going all eye-twitchy like Herbert Lom in the old Pink Panther movies.
 Grant tried to defuse the situation by offering to buy the Black Hills from the Lakota, but Sitting Bull wouldn't sell. Faced with a choice between the Indians or the miners, Grant chose to drive off the Indians. And -- cue the eye twitch -- he sent Custer to help carry out the job.
 Many books have been written about battlefield strategy at Little Big Horn, a grassland of shallow folding ravines in southeastern Montana, but it boils down to this: Custer was overwhelmingly outnumbered and chose recklessness over prudence. The paradox is that moments before the first shot was fired, Sitting Bull was ready to make peace. He and his followers escaped into Canada a few months after the battle, and ultimately returned to live on the Standing Rock reservation in South Dakota.
 Custer's defeat shocked the nation, and there was little doubt even in 1876 that Little Big Horn represented an ignoble moment in American military history. So how did a monumental disaster turn into a courageous ''last stand''?
 Philbrick's answer: A widow's spin and show business. After her husband's death, Elizabeth Custer, known as Libbie, embarked on a one-woman crusade to rehabilitate her beloved's reputation through books and speaking engagements. Buffalo Bill Cody took the myth nationwide by ending his wildly popular Wild West Show with a Little Big Horn re-enactment and a call to avenge Custer's glorious death. But really there was nothing to avenge but the poor judgment of a dangerously ambitious officer. The Battle of the Little Bighorn -- the military engagement -- was a foolish and entirely avoidable defeat. Custer's last stand -- the myth -- was simply good show business.
 If Custer illustrates how the spotlight of history sometimes shines on the wrong actor, Quanah Parker exemplifies the more deserving who get left in the shadows. One hopes a better fate awaits ''Empire of the Summer Moon,'' S. C. Gwynne's transcendent history of Parker and the Comanche nation he led in the mid- to late 1800s.
 Born the son of an Indian warrior and his white wife (who had been captured at the age of 9 during a raid on a Texas ranch), Parker grew up to become the last and greatest chief of the Comanche, the tribe that ruled the Great Plains for most of the 19th century. That's his one-sentence biography. The deeper, richer story that unfolds in ''Empire of the Summer Moon'' is nothing short of a revelation. Gwynne, a former editor at Time and Texas Monthly, doesn't merely retell the story of Parker's life. He pulls his readers through an American frontier roiling with extreme violence, political intrigue, bravery, anguish, corruption, love, knives, rifles and arrows. Lots and lots of arrows. This book will leave dust and blood on your jeans.
 Gwynne opens with the May 1836 Comanche raid on the Parker homestead. The Parkers were a clan of Illinois pioneers working 16,100 acres near present-day Dallas. In 1836 they represented the leading edge of white westward expansion into Comanche territory, which the tribe didn't like one bit. They expressed their displeasure by killing the Parker men (though a few escaped) and taking two women and three children captive.
 The term ''Indian raid'' glosses over the atrocities. Men and babies were killed as a matter of course. Mutilation, rape and torture were common. The lucky died quickly. ''This was the actual, and often quite grim, reality of the frontier,'' Gwynne writes. ''This treatment was not reserved for whites or Mexicans; it was practiced just as energetically on rival Indian tribes.''
 The Comanche weren't merely one of many tribes steamrolled by Manifest Destiny. They were a Native American superpower, a thesis put forth in Pekka Hamalainen's Bancroft Prize-winning study, ''The Comanche Empire,'' oddly not cited here. Gwynne presents the Great Plains wars of the mid-19th century as the clash of three empires: the United States, Mexico and the Comanche nation, which controlled most of modern-day Texas, New Mexico, Colorado, Kansas and Oklahoma.
 ''They held sway over some 20 different tribes who had been either conquered, driven off or reduced to vassal status,'' Gwynne writes. ''Such imperial dominance was no accident of geography. It was the product of over 150 years of deliberate, sustained combat against a series of enemies over a singular piece of land that contained the country's largest buffalo herds.'' At the height of their power in the late 1830s, the Comanche contemplated a full-scale invasion of Texas and Mexico.
 Native American tribes weren't -- and still aren't -- static entities. They waxed, they waned. Some gained power and territory, others lost it. The rise of the Comanche was the kind of case study of timing and technology that Jared Diamond described in ''Guns, Germs, and Steel.'' They came from Wyoming; short, squat-legged, with little of the social or cultural development of neighboring tribes. Then everything changed. ''What happened to the tribe between roughly 1625 and 1750 was one of the great social and military transformations in history,'' Gwynne writes.
 What happened was the horse. Spanish conquistadors introduced the animals to Mexico in the 16th century, and they quickly dispersed northward. The Comanche adapted to this transformative technology more quickly and completely than any other Plains tribe. ''No one could outride them or outshoot them from the back of a horse,'' Gwynne relates. The key was a Comanche warrior's ability to attack and shoot arrows while at full gallop, a skill few others could master. On the Great Plains this was the equivalent of attacking from tanks, and the Comanche used their military advantage to become wealthy traders in horses and buffalo hides.
 Which brings us back to the raid on the Parker ranch. The Comanche didn't raid for sport. They had specific political and economic ends in mind. The political goal was to drive the white settlers (squatters and land thieves, from the tribe's point of view) out of Comanche territory. To that end, death, terror and torture proved to be effective. By the 1860s the Comanche were actually rolling the frontier backward in Texas. The economics of raiding were equally straightforward. Young Cynthia Ann Parker was captured and not killed partly because the Comanche needed women to keep their buffalo economy humming. The men killed the bison, but the women, Gwynne writes, ''did all the value-added work: preparing the hides and decorating the robes.'' The more captives and wives -- as with Cynthia Parker, the former sometimes became the latter -- the more product a man could produce.
 Parker had a son named Quanah. Quanah grew up quickly. When he was 12, his father was killed in battle and his mother was captured by white troops. (They saw it as a rescue, but Parker was forever trying to escape back to the Comanche.) A vengeful Quanah began raiding white settlements. He was good at it, too. But skill in battle wasn't his problem. Timing was. He happened to rise as a leader just as the whites acquired their own transformative technology: the railroad and the repeating firearm. The railroad could cheaply transport valuable buffalo hides to Eastern markets, which made it profitable for men like Buffalo Bill to massacre the great herds. Between 1868 and 1881, 31 million buffalo were slaughtered, destroying the source of Comanche wealth and food. Meanwhile, the nimble Colt revolver and the powerful Sharps .50-caliber rifle countered the Comanche's once-superior weaponry. The empire crumbled.
 Quanah Parker's second act was, if anything, more remarkable than his first. Resigned to reservation life, he transformed himself from a death-dealing warrior to a prosperous cattleman and a hard-bargaining politician who earned the respect and friendship of Teddy Roosevelt. He played a leading role in establishing the Native American Church and its practice of peyotism, the use of hallucinogenic peyote cactus in religious ritual. ''The white man goes into his church and talks about Jesus,'' Parker once said, ''but the Indian goes into his tipi and talks to Jesus.'' In a 370-page biography, Gwynne devotes but a single paragraph to Parker and peyote. There are simply too many other good stories to tell.
 We may never shake Custer's place in the American story. He's just too colorful a character, and ''The Last Stand'' will introduce him to a generation too young to have encountered him in Evan S. Connell's classic biography, ''Son of the Morning Star,'' or the movie ''Little Big Man.'' But thanks to Gwynne, the story of Quanah Parker may assume a more fittingly prominent role in the history of the American West. ''Empire of the Summer Moon'' isn't just a biography. It's a forceful argument about the place of Native American tribes in geopolitical history. The word ''nation'' is sometimes used today to refer to a specific tribe, and it can be confusing to non-Indians. Does it mean a belonging, like Red Sox nation? Or state power, like Germany? The Comanche of the 1800s were truly a nation more like Germany. And you crossed them at your peril.

HEADLINE: This Time Is Different

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
My friend, Mark Mykleby, who works in the Pentagon, shared with me this personal letter to the editor he got published last week in his hometown paper, The Beaufort Gazette in South Carolina. It is the best reaction I've seen to the BP oil spill -- and also the best advice to President Obama on exactly whom to kick you know where. 
 ''I'd like to join in on the blame game that has come to define our national approach to the ongoing environmental disaster in the Gulf of Mexico. This isn't BP's or Transocean's fault. It's not the government's fault. It's my fault. I'm the one to blame and I'm sorry. It's my fault because I haven't digested the world's in-your-face hints that maybe I ought to think about the future and change the unsustainable way I live my life. If the geopolitical, economic, and technological shifts of the 1990s didn't do it; if the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 didn't do it; if the current economic crisis didn't do it; perhaps this oil spill will be the catalyst for me, as a citizen, to wean myself off of my petroleum-based lifestyle. 'Citizen' is the key word. It's what we do as individuals that count. For those on the left, government regulation will not solve this problem. Government's role should be to create an environment of opportunity that taps into the innovation and entrepreneurialism that define us as Americans. For those on the right, if you want less government and taxes, then decide what you'll give up and what you'll contribute. Here's the bottom line: If we want to end our oil addiction, we, as citizens, need to pony up: bike to work, plant a garden, do something. So again, the oil spill is my fault. I'm sorry. I haven't done my part. Now I have to convince my wife to give up her S.U.V. Mark Mykleby.''
 I think Mykleby's letter gets at something very important: We cannot fix what ails America unless we look honestly at our own roles in creating our own problems. We -- both parties -- created an awful set of incentives that encouraged our best students to go to Wall Street to create crazy financial instruments instead of to Silicon Valley to create new products that improve people's lives. We -- both parties -- created massive tax incentives and cheap money to make home mortgages available to people who really didn't have the means to sustain them. And we -- both parties -- sent BP out in the gulf to get us as much oil as possible at the cheapest price. (Of course, we expected them to take care, but when you're drilling for oil beneath 5,000 feet of water, stuff happens.)
 As Pogo would say, we have met the enemy and he is us.
 But that means we're also the solution -- if we're serious. Look, we managed to survive 9/11 without letting it destroy our open society or rule of law. We managed to survive the Wall Street crash without letting it destroy our economy. Hopefully, we will survive the BP oil spill without it destroying our coastal ecosystems. But we dare not press our luck.
 We have to use this window of opportunity to insulate ourselves as much as possible against all the bad things we cannot control and get serious about fixing the problems that we can control. We need to make our whole country more sustainable. So let's pass an energy-climate bill that really reduces our dependence on Middle East oil. Let's pass a financial regulatory reform bill that really reduces the odds of another banking crisis. Let's get our fiscal house in order, as the economy recovers. And let's pass an immigration bill that will enable us to attract the world's top talent and remain the world's leader in innovation.
 We need all the cushions we can get right now, because we are living in a world of cascading and intertwined threats that have the potential to turn our country upside down at any moment. We do not know when the next Times Square bomber might get lucky. We don't know how long the U.S. and Israel will tolerate Iran's nuclear program. We don't know if Pakistan will hold together and what might happen to its nukes. We don't know when North Korea will go nuts. We don't know if the European Union can keep financing the debts of Greece, Hungary and Spain -- and what financial contagion might be set off if it can't.
 ''It is not your imagination,'' says corporate strategy consultant Peter Schwartz -- there is a lot more scary stuff hanging over the world today. Since the end of the cold war and the rise of the Internet, we've lost the walls and the superpowers that together kept the world's problems more contained. Today, smaller and smaller units can wreak larger and larger havoc -- and whatever havoc is wreaked now gets spread faster and farther than ever before.
 That is why we have to solve the big problems in our control, not postpone them or pretend that more lobby-driven, lowest-common-denominator solutions are still satisfactory. A crisis is a terrible thing to waste, but a reprieve and a breathing spell -- which is what we're having right now -- is a really terrible thing to waste. We don't want to look back on this moment and say: How could we have gone back to business as usual and petty political gridlocks with all those black swans circling around us? Then we will really kick ourselves.

HEADLINE: For Better, for Worse, for B.M.I.

BYLINE: By ABBY ELLIN

 BODY:
BLAME the pizza. That's what Jennifer Deans does. She blames the pizza she and her husband devoured on a regular basis for the combined 95 pounds they gained in the four years that they have been married.
 Before their May 2006 wedding, the couple did the requisite whittling down of their bodies. Mr. Deans, now 32 and a financial adviser in Fairfax, Va., lost 60 pounds; his bride, who is 30 and a youth pastor, lost about 45. The beginning of the end, at least in terms of their physiques, took place during their Virginia Beach honeymoon, when they indulged in everything they had denied themselves before their wedding day.
 And then the wedding gown went into mothballs and life kicked in. They worked hard. They socialized. Mr. Deans, a Food Network disciple, whipped up big, hearty Italian dinners, which the couple topped off with ice cream. By January of this year, Ms. Deans was 45 pounds heavier and Mr. Deans was up 50. 
 ''My wife and I both feel comfortable with each other to the point that we know that no matter what, we both can be happy,'' Mr. Deans said. ''That probably added to our feelings of 'I'm good, I'm fine.' '' 
 Call them happy pounds, love chub or the marriage 15. No matter what, gaining weight during marriage is about as common as holding your breath under water. 
 A 2008 study in the Journal of Economics and Human Biology examined data from 12,000 men and women ages 18 to mid-40s. Compared with when they were single, the body mass index (or B.M.I., a height-to-weight ratio) of married men increased by 1.5 percent above and beyond what they would normally gain as they aged, and that of women shot up 2 percent. 
 ''Marriage brings along with it social obligations: you eat out more, entertain more frequently, cook meals more frequently, and there's also an element of being too busy to exercise,'' said Laura Argys, an economics professor at the University of Colorado at Denver and an author of the study. What's more, for better and worse, married couples tend to share behaviors and activities, like snuggling on the couch with a vat of popcorn rather than hopping on the treadmill.
 There are also incentives that could explain why the B.M.I. of couples who lived together without making it legal increased by only about 1 percent. If you're married, the thinking goes, you're somewhat settled. You don't have to prove yourself; your spouse will ostensibly love you, all of you, muffin top notwithstanding.
 A 2009 study published in Obesity surveyed 1,293 young adults between 18 and 27 years old who were married, living together or dating. The married couples were threefold more likely to both be obese, whereas the cohabiting couples had close to double the risk. (The dating people were the thinnest.)
 ''Physical attributes -- especially for women -- play a role in marriage markets, so you might extend more effort having a healthy body weight if you're in the dating pool,'' said Penny Gordon-Larsen, an associate professor of nutrition at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill and an author of the study. In other words: The less stable the relationship, the less likely you'll gain weight because the chance that you'll be out there, back on the market, is greater, and thus, the need to be attractive once again is heightened.
 And then there are the very real logistical changes that come with cohabitation: He is a champion snorer and she can't sleep with a foghorn blaring in her ear (disruptive sleep patterns contribute to weight gain). She is pregnant and he matches her Whopper for Whopper or, conversely, he eats like a lumberjack and she follows suit.
 ''Women don't practice portion control, and when eating out are served the same size meal as their husbands -- and finish their plate,'' said Danielle Omar, a registered dietitian in Fairfax, Va., who has been helping the Deans slim down. ''Couples tend to drink alcohol with meals and eat dessert after a big meal more often.''
 Dr. David Edelson, the founder and chief executive of Thin-Site (thin-site.com), a weight-loss site, and the medical director of HealthBridge, a group practice in Manhasset, N.Y., cites stress, incompatible food habits, an increase in medications, a decrease in metabolism, child-rearing, smoking cessation and unconscious sabotage as other culprits. 
 ''One partner might be jealous of the other, and feed them to gain excess weight and make them less attractive to potential suitors,'' he said.
 And then there's just the joy that comes from gazing into each other's eyes over a steaming plate of linguine and letting the happy vibes seep in with the olive oil. This might explain why Joe Lilly, a 32-year-old Internet marketer in Las Vegas, added 40 pounds after his May 2007 wedding (his wife, Stephanie, put on 10). 
 ''While I don't think I got lazy, my priorities certainly shifted,'' he said. ''I went from spending spare time in the gym trying to impress my lady to spending spare time with my lady and our friends.''
 The good news, at least from a corporeal perspective, is that if the relationship disintegrates people tend to lose weight. According to Professor Argys, divorced men usually revert to their pre-marriage B.M.I., and divorced women's B.M.I.'s are actually 2.5 percent lower than when they married. 
 Why? ''If you're single, you have a strong incentive to look good,'' said Uri Gneezy, an economics professor at the University of California, San Diego, who has completed a yet-to-be-published study on the subject. ''You're looking for a good match.''
 And so the cycle continues.

HEADLINE: The High Cost Of Phone Loyalty

BYLINE: By DAMON DARLIN

 BODY:
OUR cellphones have become love objects. We take them everywhere and stare at them constantly. We panic when they are lost and grieve when they die. We even clothe them.
 If we covet a new one, well -- I'll stop the analogy here, because economists have a better way to describe the problem: there are switching costs. That's their term for the barrier that keeps us from blithely embracing a new product.
 You would think that there were few barriers to switching cellphones. But the carriers try to make it harder to switch by locking customers into two-year contracts with high early-termination fees. And each handset maker also inspires loyalty by continually making improvements in its phones, as Apple announced last week for its iPhone. Some people may complain incessantly about their iPhone and AT&T's service for it, but not that many are switching. And that's just the way the companies have intended it. 
 Some products have low switching costs -- a car or canned corn, for instance, because it's not much bother to replace these products, and the manufacturer takes no extreme measures to keep you loyal. 
 Choosing a flight should be a simple matter of schedule and cost, but the airlines try to make it harder with their frequent-flier programs. Even your sandwich shop may hand out loyalty cards so your 10th sandwich is free.
 There are social switching costs, too. Switching free e-mail services is no small matter because of the bother of informing all your correspondents of your new address. It's one reason that Facebook doesn't worry too much that you'll dump it over some privacy imbroglio. You could move to another social network service, but would all your friends follow you?
 When the switching costs are high, a company that has your loyalty can abuse it by charging more. When switching costs are removed, prices may fall.
 In a classic bit of economic sleuthing, Minjung Park, an assistant professor of economics at the University of Minnesota, looked at the impact of the Federal Communications Commission's mandate that customers could keep their phone numbers when they switched carriers, starting in late 2003 in large markets and mid-2004 in smaller ones. (The phone companies had fought the decision because nonportability had been a very effective way to hold onto customers.) 
 She examined more than 100,000 calling plans and found that the prices of wireless plans dropped by as much as 6.8 percent in the seven months after the rule change. After adjusting for the overall trend in wireless prices, she calculated that the savings totaled $845 million during that period. 
 That evidence fits the prevailing thinking about switching costs and market competition: reduce the switching costs and companies will cut prices to acquire new customers.
 The other half of the economic theory, and the reason that economists are still debating the impact of switching costs, is that companies have every incentive to raise prices on the customers they have already captured.
 That looks like what AT&T is doing to some of its customers. This month, before the announcement of the new Apple iPhone, it cut the price of its service by half for those who don't consume much data on their phones. These tend to be the newbies who are just discovering that a phone can be used to search the Web, stream music and videos and basically substitute for almost everything a computer does.
 AT&T also cut the price slightly for users of more data -- presumably the first adopters who are the power users of smartphones. But it simultaneously capped the use of data and said it would charge even more for those who wanted to watch three movies a month on their phones.
 Is it madness to treat your oldest customers that way? Not if you look at the bigger picture. Sure, some owners of Apple phones might switch to a phone offered by Verizon or Sprint. But even those who successfully fight a carrier to avoid the early-termination fee act like the dog that finally catches the car: Now what? They find that there's a switching cost in moving away from the software they learned to use or the apps they learned to love.
 AT&T created a bit more friction for those heavy users by assuring them that they were grandfathered into their all-you-can-eat data plans, giving them reason to rethink leaving AT&T's embrace for another company that just might follow its lead.
 BUT the battle isn't really about first adopters choosing between an iPhone or the latest Android phone like Verizon's Droid Incredible or Sprint's EVO running on the most advanced cell network.
 Certainly, that's where the drama is, but it is in some ways a sideshow accounting for a small percentage of all phones sold worldwide, as noted recently by Bill Gurley, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist who writes a blog called abovethecrowd. Mr. Gurley points out that the carriers and handset makers are vying for the vast mass of consumers now using so-called feature phones -- those that are discounted by carriers or offered at no cost and can't access the Web. 
 About 55 million people worldwide use iPhones, an impressive number, to be sure. But there are billions of feature-phone users worldwide, and they will make the move up to smartphones as the cost of both the phones and the service drops. (And it will. The cost of delivering bits drops about 50 percent with every generation of network technology.)
 Apple needs to stay ahead of Android phones, but an Android phone doesn't have to be as good as an Apple phone to entice new customers, Mr. Gurley says. ''It only needs to be dramatically better than the current feature phone. Which it is.''
 The perverse lesson from all of this for the consumer? Infidelity often pays off better than blind loyalty.

HEADLINE: 'The Second Sex'

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 There may indeed be much that is dated about Simone de Beauvoir's ''Second Sex,'' but contrary to Francine du Plessix Gray's claim (May 30), there is nothing ''preposterous'' in the assertion that ''one is not born, but rather becomes, a woman.''
 This line has inspired some of the most interesting and influential thinking in feminist theory over the past five decades. It has brought students to understand the differences and relations between sex (as in the body one is born with) and gender (as in the way one is brought to interpret and live that body), and about the historical and cultural determinants that produce notions of femininity. 
 Gray diminishes the importance of this assertion by suggesting that it was meant to bolster Beauvoir's idea that marriage and motherhood were merely ''institutions imposed by men to curb women's freedom.'' Understood within Beauvoir's existential framework, this sentence claims, rather, that women can be women without having to be mothers; that there is no ''natural'' image of femininity that women must subscribe to (or else accept that they are ''unnatural''); and that each woman has, within certain biological and economic limitations, a share in defining her own idea of what it means to live her sex and her sexuality. For anyone who has been accused of not acting ''ladylike,'' there is nothing dated about Beauvoir's assertion.
 KARI WEIL Middletown, Conn. The writer is a visiting professor in the College of Letters at Wesleyan University.
 To the Editor:
 Francine du Plessix Gray's review of the new translation of ''The Second Sex'' focuses primarily on the book's failings. Gray cites numerous examples of ''dated'' pronouncements that no longer apply to today's sexually free, independent women. While it is true that Beauvoir is hard on the institutions of marriage and motherhood, perhaps her wariness in these matters is still justified. After all, one of her key contentions -- which Gray does not choose to discuss -- is that women will always be second-class citizens until they are able to support themselves. Even today, marriage and motherhood are major factors in the gender gap between American men's and women's wages.
 It is one thing to ignore the many positive features of ''The Second Sex'' (for example, the way Beauvoir deconstructs the writings of D. H. Lawrence and other male authors) and quite another to dismiss as ''preposterous'' Beauvoir's claim that one is not born, but becomes, a woman. Gray bases her argument on the sight of male toddlers grabbing cars and guns while girls cherish their dolls. The complex interaction between nature and nurturance cannot be dismissed so easily, as the extensive scholarly literature on this subject makes abundantly clear. Let me simply add my personal experience to Gray's: as the mother of three sons and one daughter, I observed a much greater fluidity in their choice of toys, marked less by gender than by individual temperament.
 Just as Gray reacts negatively to the content of ''The Second Sex,'' so, too, she finds fault with the new translation. It does not ''flow as nicely'' as the earlier one. Constance Borde and Sheila Malovany-Chevallier produced a highly literal, complete translation, down to Beauvoir's original punctuation. This sometimes makes for difficult reading, and well it should, since ''The Second Sex'' is -- among other things -- a philosophical text. Would anyone think of translating Heidegger so that he flows nicely, when he rarely does?
 MARILYN YALOM Stanford, Calif. The writer is a senior scholar at the Michelle R. Clayman Institute for Gender Research at Stanford University.
 To the Editor:
 Unfortunately, Francine du Plessix Gray repeats the legend about Simone de Beauvoir's nickname ''Castor'' (Beaver) that American reviewers and commentators have been passing around for 50 years. As both Castor and her first lover, Rene Maheu, told me when I interviewed them for my biography of Jean-Paul Sartre, she got that name when both were graduate students because the word ''beauvoir'' sounded very much like the word ''beaver.'' ''It had nothing to do with her work habits,'' Sartre, who was part of their gang, told me. ''We were Americanizing everything we could then, mainly because we loved American movies. We all gave each other American-sounding names, but 'beaver' stuck, so eventually we translated it to the French 'castor.' '' Indeed, on the wall of his office, Maheu, who was director general of Unesco when I interviewed him, had a photograph of her signed ''Beaver,'' not ''Castor.''
 JOHN GERASSI New York The writer is the author of ''Jean-Paul Sartre: Hated Conscience of His Century'' and ''Talking With Sartre.''

HEADLINE: For Hartford Stage, Facelift at the Theater

BYLINE: By ANITA GATES

 BODY:
ELAINE Stritch, Chita Rivera and Ben Vereen are doing Hartford Stage's ''Broadway Legends'' series this summer, but you won't find them at the usual place on Church Street. They'll be about five miles away, in the Roberts Theater at the Kingswood-Oxford School in West Hartford, while Hartford Stage's 33-year-old theater gets a $4 million makeover. The renovation is the first phase of a two-part project expected to be completed by 2013, before the celebration of the theater's 50th anniversary.
 ''The next time you come, you will feel -- artists, staff and patrons will feel -- a sense of expanded space,'' said Michael Wilson, Hartford Stage's longtime artistic director. That moment (the completion of phase one) will arrive in October, when ''Antony and Cleopatra,'' starring Kate Mulgrew, is scheduled to open. By then the lower lobby will be larger, taking over the space where the public restrooms used to be, and big new restrooms -- 17 units in the ladies' -- will be installed in what until now has been garage space. 
 The stage will be raised, bringing the floor to a uniform level, which will make it possible for handicapped theatergoers to enter without using ramps. And when a production requires going from a thrust-stage configuration to a proscenium setup, the added front section of seating will be raked, allowing for better visibility. (In the past, at ''The Orphans' Home Cycle'' and other productions, people in the front section had to be seated in folding chairs.) 
 There will probably never be a Hartford Stage production of ''Caddyshack,'' but if there were, the gopher pop-up scenes could easily be recreated with the new trap system. It will allow trapdoor openings in any and every part of the stage, which used to have only one. Improved sound and lighting systems are also being added.
 Changes backstage, where cast members of the past had to climb a double flight of stairs to get to their dressing rooms, include the creation of a permanent stage-level dressing room -- an ''hommage'' to Elizabeth Ashley, who starred in four Hartford Stage productions, Mr. Wilson said with a laugh.
 ''It probably goes back to '8 by Tenn,' '' he said, referring to Hartford Stage's 2003 production of eight playlets by Tennessee Williams. ''We created one for her, kind of a portable dressing room that we're able to put up or take down as needed.'' 
 A diagram of the renovation is on the theater's Web site, hartfordstage.org. Although some of the improvements, like roof repairs, will not be apparent to playgoers, the new heating, ventilation and air-conditioning system is sure to be noticed and welcomed by all.
 ''There's only one system that services the entire space,'' said Michael Stotts, Hartford Stage's managing director. ''Quite frequently what you will have is audience members who are quite cold and actors who are quite warm.'' After the renovation, the different areas can be heated and cooled separately.
 Mr. Stotts is well aware that in economic times like these, Hartford Stage is very fortunate to be able to embark on such an ambitious project, whose second phase will include a refurbished theater interior, further lobby expansion and the installation of an elevator.
 ''Despite the fact that there is a recession going on and arts organizations are hurting as much as everyone, we are very grateful to the community for supporting our campaign,'' he said. 
 ''We're not dreaming too big,'' he added, ''but we're taking care of the things that will allow us to serve our artists and audiences far into the future.''

HEADLINE: Don't Let the Euro Dictate Your Portfolio

BYLINE: By PAUL J. LIM. 
Paul J. Lim is a senior editor at Money magazine. E-mail: fund@nytimes.com

 BODY:
FOR Americans with significant exposure to foreign stocks, the euro's 16 percent decline against the dollar this year may lead to second thoughts.
 After all, the same forces that led to the euro's drop -- namely, the region's mounting debt and credit problems -- have pushed European stock prices sharply lower. And the currency's fall to $1.21 last week from $1.43 at the start of the year has only exacerbated those losses. 
 Although the Morgan Stanley Capital International EAFE (for Europe, Australasia and the Far East) index of foreign shares is down nearly 7 percent in 2010, the losses have been twice as large for Americans after factoring in the strengthening dollar. 
 But before investors start changing their portfolios because of concerns over currency risk, market strategists advise them to consider several things. 
 For starters, the euro has been weakening for only about seven months, a short period on which to base long-term portfolio decisions. To be sure, fears are growing that the euro could slide for several more months, and some economists say it could even fall to parity with the dollar. But remember that only six months ago, many economists were concerned about the dollar's weakness and the euro's strength. 
 And while foreign currency fluctuations have served as a headwind for Americans investing in Europe lately, they have been a tailwind for Americans investing abroad for much of the last decade. 
 Over the last 10 years, the EAFE index has fallen about 4 percent, annualized, in local currencies. But because the dollar was weakening against the euro and other world currencies for much of this period, Americans suffered milder losses, just 2 percent a year, on average, in EAFE stocks. This may partly explain why investors in recent years have poured more money into stock funds with mainly foreign holdings than into those that mainly hold domestic stocks.
 Keep in mind, too, that while the dollar has strengthened against the euro this year, it hasn't necessarily gained that much ground against other currencies, said Alec B. Young, international equity strategist for Standard & Poor's Equity Research Services.
 Mr. Young points out that while the dollar's rise has been a huge burden on European stock holdings, ''there's been much less currency drag when it comes to the emerging markets.'' While the dollar has risen against the Brazilian real and the South Korean won, for example, it has lost value against currencies like the Mexican peso and the Thai baht. That explains why, since the start of the year, the MSCI Emerging Markets index has lost about 6 percent in local currencies and 8 percent in dollars.
 In countries like Japan and Canada, currency fluctuations have worked to the benefit of American investors. Although the MSCI Japan stock index is down nearly 7 percent this year, those losses amount to less than 5 percent when converted into dollars. Mr. Young argued that this shows the risks of abandoning a foreign investing strategy simply because of the euro's woes.
 Perhaps the best case for maintaining overseas holdings, though, is that exposure to different currencies has been shown to make a portfolio more stable, and not more volatile, in the long run.
 How is that possible?
 Stock markets around the world have grown more correlated, thanks to the effects of globalization. In fact, there is now a correlation level of about 0.9 between movements in the Standard & Poor's 500 index of domestic stocks and the EAFE. (A correlation of 1.0 would indicate that two investments were in perfect sync.)
 But Peng Chen, president of Ibbotson Associates, the investment advisory firm, notes that currency fluctuations are one aspect of foreign investing that has been shown to be essentially unrelated to movements in the S.& P. 500. In fact, over the last 20 years, the correlation between movements in European currencies and the S.& P. 500 has been just a negative 0.07, he said. 
 (Negative correlation implies that when the currencies rise against the dollar, the S.& P. 500 may fall, and vice versa, but the 0.07 figure is so small that the two movements can be seen as virtually independent.) 
 MICHELE GAMBERA, head of quantitative analysis at UBS Global Asset Management in Chicago, says that even if foreign stocks no longer zig when domestic shares zag, one reason that these asset classes don't always post similar returns each year is the currency effect.
 ''By having even some passive exposure to different currencies, you are adding diversification,'' he said. 
 Of course, this currency exposure can bolster returns in some years and hurt them in others. It's hard to predict.
 But that's the point of diversification -- maintaining broad-based exposure to various assets, even if some might lose value, because it's impossible to tell when one investment will fare better than another.

HEADLINE: Finally, Borrowers Score Points

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
WHILE the wheels of justice have turned very slowly in the years since our nation's financiers and regulators nearly cratered our economy, the Federal Trade Commission's settlement last Monday with Countrywide Home Loans suggests that they haven't entirely ground to a halt.
 Countrywide, now a unit of Bank of America, was once led by Angelo Mozilo and was the nation's largest mortgage lender in the glorious, pre-crisis days of the housing boom. But it was also a predatory institution, and the F.T.C., citing Countrywide's serial abuse of troubled borrowers, extracted a $108 million fine from Bank of America last week. 
 That money will go back to some 200,000 customers whom Countrywide forced to pay outsized fees for foreclosure services. These included billing a borrower $300 to have a property's lawn mowed and levying $2,500 in trustees' fees on another borrower, when the going rate for that service was about $600. 
 Though Countrywide's mortgage contracts specifically barred such practices, they served the company well by generating income during downturns when it was harder to keep making money off new mortgages. This ''counter-cyclical diversification strategy,'' as Countrywide called it, was designed to ''extract the last dollar out of the pockets of the most desperate consumers,'' said Jon Leibowitz, the F.T.C. chairman. 
 Mr. Leibowitz also said Countrywide made bogus claims about what homeowners owed during the resolution of bankruptcy cases and added fees to borrowers' obligations without notice. His office's investigation turned up cases in which Countrywide tried to collect improper fees years after a bankruptcy case was over. 
 In some cases, Mr. Leibowitz said, even after a distressed homeowner became up-to-date on all of his or her payments, Countrywide would start another foreclosure proceeding against the same borrower.
 PRETTY shameful, all in all. But nothing new to lawyers who represent troubled borrowers. They say these kinds of abuses still occur. 
 ''We've been screaming about these practices for I don't know how many years now,'' said David B. Shaev, a lawyer in New York City who represents consumers. ''A lot of the fees seem like nickel-and-dime charges, but they add up to big money. The $108 million in the Countrywide case is the tip of the iceberg.'' 
 The other dubious Countrywide actions identified by the F.T.C. -- pursuing foreclosure improperly, adding fees without notice -- also sound familiar to consumer lawyers across the country. 
 Consider a recent federal bankruptcy case in Houston involving Wells Fargo. The facts of the case were outlined last month in a harsh contempt ruling against the bank by Judge Jeff Bohm. 
 Back in 2003, Antoinette and Lenord De La Fuente filed for bankruptcy protection after they fell behind on their Washington Mutual mortgage. Court filings show they proposed a restructuring plan that called for 60 monthly payments to the bankruptcy trustee, who would in turn distribute the money to their creditors. The bankruptcy court agreed to the couple's plan in June 2004. 
 The couple dutifully made their payments. Wells Fargo took over their loan in June 2007 and the next January sent the couple a letter accusing them of being delinquent by $8,400. Wells told them that they had until mid-February to come up with the money or the bank would start foreclosure proceedings. 
 The court documents show that the borrowers tried unsuccessfully to argue that Wells was wrong. But Wells refused to back down; afraid they would lose their home, the couple struck a forbearance agreement and received a loan modification in April 2008. 
 This loan modification violated the borrowers' repayment plan. ''Wells Fargo frightened the De La Fuentes into making payments to Wells Fargo in violation of the confirmation order,'' Judge Bohm wrote.
 In June 2008, the couple hired a lawyer to investigate the dispute with Wells; they filed a lawsuit against the bank that August. About a year later, Wells offered to settle with the couple. In a court-approved settlement, Wells stated that the couple were indeed current on their $66,572 mortgage and owed no outstanding fees or charges. Wells agreed to pay the couple about $30,000 for their legal fees.
 With that, the couple thought their problem with Wells had been solved. 
 But in November 2009, Wells told them their mortgage balance had mysteriously increased to almost $71,000, even though they had made all of their payments. Two months later, Mrs. De La Fuente noticed that Wells had reversed several of the mortgage payments she and her husband had made. When she asked Wells why, she was told her loan was in bankruptcy status; if she wanted to resolve the problem, she would have to pay almost $9,000. Late fees were also accruing.
 The couple and their lawyer went back to court and accused Wells of violating the settlement agreement. After hearing testimony, the court agreed. It also didn't buy the argument of Wells that errors, including a computer glitch, caused the couple's problems. 
 ''The court certainly agrees that 'mistakes happen,' '' Judge Bohm wrote. ''However, when mistakes happen not once, not twice, but repeatedly, and when actions are not taken to correct these mistakes within a reasonable period of time, the failure to right the wrong -- particularly when the basis for the problem is a months-long violation of an agreed judgment -- the excuse of 'mistakes happen' has no credence.''
 Judge Bohm also punted Wells's claim that its problems with the couple were anomalies. He cited three other federal cases -- one in Florida and two in Louisiana -- in which Wells improperly collected money from borrowers, applied payments inappropriately, overcharged borrowers or failed to keep accurate records. The judge imposed $11,825 in fines on Wells and required it to pay $4,544 in lawyer's fees to the De La Fuentes. 
 Teri Schrettenbrunner, a Wells Fargo spokeswoman, said, ''There is no doubt here that we didn't handle this case well, but it is rare that you see a confluence of this many errors coming together as you did on this case.'' 
 She contended that a vast majority of Wells's mortgage customers are satisfied with it and that its operations are nothing like Countrywide's. ''There are significant contrasts between the way Countrywide did business and the way we do business,'' she said. 
 NEVERTHELESS, for imperiled borrowers, the new scrutiny on foreclosure practices is long overdue. Thankfully, the United States Trustee, the Department of Justice unit that oversees the nation's bankruptcy courts, is also investigating possible improprieties among lenders, mortgage servicers and the law firms that represent them in bankruptcy cases against homeowners. The trustee's office assisted the F.T.C. in the Countrywide matter. 
 It's a slow process, to be sure. But at least it is proceeding.

HEADLINE: A Race for Governor of Arizona, With a Lap in New York

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM

 BODY:
Seeking to harness some of the national uproar over Arizona's new immigration law, the state's likely Democratic candidate for governor this fall and the chairman of Arizona's Democratic Party visited New York last week. 
 The visit, paid for by the Arizona state party, was intended to cultivate political donors and to raise the profile of Terry Goddard, Arizona's attorney general and the presumed Democratic candidate for governor. 
 Mr. Goddard, a Navy veteran, Harvard graduate and former mayor of Phoenix, had private meetings and spoke at a luncheon on Friday at the Harvard Club of New York. The audience of 45 included lawyers and bankers, some with roots in Arizona and others who said they were simply alarmed by political trends there. 
 Also attending were some prominent Democratic donors and fund-raisers, including Sarah and Victor Kovner of New York. 
 ''For good or ill, Arizona has taken a leading spot on a national issue,'' said Ms. Kovner, who is a member of the Democratic National Committee. 
 ''Please give us help in trying to defend what really matters,'' Mr. Goddard told the lunch group. He accused Republicans of diverting attention from the state's dire economic condition and the true border problem: crime and violence associated with drug cartels. 
 The disputed law, known as SB 1070, allows the police to check the documents of anyone they stop whom they suspect of being in the country illegally. Opponents say that the law, which is to take effect on July 29, infringes on federal authority and that it will lead to racial profiling. 
 Mr. Goddard said the immigration law and others passed by the conservative State Legislature not only endangered Arizona's economy by provoking boycotts but had also tarnished the image of a state with a tradition of ethnic cooperation. ''I pledge to keep Arizona off of Comedy Central for the next four years,'' he said, drawing laughs. 
 Mr. Goddard said Republicans were already discussing further anti-immigrant measures of dubious legality, including refusing to issue birth certificates to babies born in the state to undocumented parents. 
 The Arizona Democratic chairman, Don Bivens, who is a lawyer in Phoenix, embellished the theme of a spreading cancer, appealing for donations ''for Arizona and for the country.''
 Because Mr. Goddard is running under the state's public financing law, donors cannot give money directly. Mr. Bivens asked for donations to the state party, which plans to mobilize potential voters, including Hispanic residents, who traditionally have a low turnout. 
 Mr. Goddard acknowledged that the immigration law has put him in a bind. He previously argued against it as bad policy, but as attorney general he says he will vigorously defend it against legal challenges, including one expected from the Obama administration. 
 ''I'm damned if I do and damned if I don't,'' he said in an interview. If the state prevails in court, he will anger Hispanic and liberal voters, and if it loses, others will accuse him of not trying hard enough. 
 Gov. Jan Brewer, who faces a primary battle for the Republican nomination but whose popularity soared after she signed the bill, has bored in on Mr. Goddard, saying she wants to use an outside lawyer to defend the state. 
 ''We're going to be dogged by this topic, and we'll continue to try and change the subject,'' Mr. Goddard said. ''I want to talk about getting more jobs and building the economy.''

HEADLINE: Down to the River to Play, and Sing and Dance

BYLINE: By PHILLIP LUTZ

 BODY:
LAST year, when Jeff Rumpf was planning the 32nd annual Great Hudson River Revival -- some version of the event, widely known as the Clearwater Festival, has been held since the mid-1960s -- he made what he now calls a big mistake.
 ''I took advice from everybody in the industry,'' he said. 
 He was advised to market the festival like a commercial enterprise, even though its prevailing aesthetic is noncommercial and its proceeds go directly to Hudson River Sloop Clearwater, a nonprofit environmental group, where Mr. Rumpf is the executive director.
 '''Why don't you guys do Mountain Jam? Why don't you guys be like K-Rock?' '' he said he was told, referring to the popular festival upstate at Hunter Mountain and the New York City radio station. And in retrospect, he said, that ''was not what we wanted.''
 This year, the festival, which will take place June 19 and 20 at Croton Point Park in Croton-on-Hudson, is returning to form -- reasserting its identity as a musical hub for social causes, reinvigorating its world music offerings and reaching out to a new festival, Beacon Riverfest, to discuss coordinating activities next year.
 ''We're going back to the good old days,'' said Pete Seeger, folk-singing legend and the festival's founder.
 With seven stages to fill and the weight of history to contend with, Clearwater's programmers have plenty on their hands just balancing musical constituencies. This year's programming will address an imbalance that Mr. Seeger said had developed on the festival's Dance Stage, where he felt that some of the amplified music had grown so loud that people were discouraged from dancing. 
 Under a new festival director, Steve Lurie, the stage has been renamed -- it is now the World Dance Stage -- and its programming revamped. As in earlier years, Mr. Lurie said, it will host a wide global mix, with Celtic interpretations from the Irish fiddler Eileen Ivers and the Quebecois folk group Le Vent du Nord; percussion-based sounds from Bonga and the Vodou Drums of Haiti and Famoro Dioubate's Kakande; Balkan-flavored brass from Slavic Soul Party; and folk-inflected jazz from Folklore Urbano, which hails from Colombia by way of Tarrytown. Pablo Mayor, Urbano's leader, said he will bring a 12-piece ensemble to the show. 
 Bonga and Famoro Dioubate will also appear on the Sloop Stage, where the festival's workshops will be consolidated. There, David Amram will do double duty -- holding a workshop on world dance rhythms and appearing at a tribute to the singer and activist Odetta, who died in 2008, that will involve at least five performers, including the singer-songwriter Steve Earle. Mr. Earle will also appear on the Rainbow Stage, the biggest platform, where the singer-songwriter Shawn Colvin and the guitarist and composer David Bromberg will play. 
 One workshop will analyze songs that promote social causes. Mr. Seeger, 91, regularly works with Hudson Valley schoolchildren -- a recent session involved changes to his classic song ''If I Had a Hammer'' -- and some of the children are scheduled to appear with him on the Rainbow and Family Stages. His unscheduled appearances, Mr. Seeger said, may include one with Ms. Ivers. As usual, he will also lead the riverfront ceremony that closes the festival.
 A week after Clearwater begins, Beacon Riverfest, a one-day event in Beacon's Riverfront Park, will make its debut. Mr. Rumpf said he might be interested in collaborating with Riverfest and in opening discussions about sending a flotilla there next year. ''Everybody who gets down to the river is a real plus for these communities, economically as well as socially,'' he said. 
 Whether the fit would be a good one remains to be seen. While Riverfront Park is surrounded on three sides by the Hudson, Riverfest at this point has no special commitment to the river's cleanup, said Stephen Clair, the festival's director. Rather, he said, it is simply a rock concert -- on the bill are the Fleshtones, Tracy Bonham and Yarn -- and, for the moment, a free one that will generate little revenue.
 Mr. Clair, whose home, like Clearwater's headquarters, is in Beacon, has connections of sorts to Mr. Seeger, who is also a Beacon resident: Habitat for Humanity of Newburgh has hired Mr. Clair as producer of a July 3 benefit at which Mr. Seeger will appear. 
 Told of Mr. Rumpf's offer, Mr. Clair said, ''I'm certainly open to conversation with anyone about expanding the reach of this event, but at the same time, I want this event to have its own identity.'' 
 The Great Hudson River Revival starts at 11 a.m. on June 19 and 20 at Croton Point Park, Croton-on-Hudson. Advance tickets available until June 18: nonmembers, one day, $65; weekend pass, $90; weekend pass with camping, $125; members get a discount. Call (845) 418-3596 or visit clearwaterfestival.org.; Beacon Riverfest starts at 2 p.m. on June 26 at Riverfront Park, Beacon. Free admission. For more information, visit beaconriverfest.com.

HEADLINE: A Two-Trick Pony: 305 Horses, 31 M.P.G.

BYLINE: By JOHN PEARLEY HUFFMAN

 BODY:
SANTA BARBARA, Calif.
 LESS than a single model year after it showed up for work, the 2010 Ford Mustang received a gold watch and a retirement package. Despite sheet metal that was still fresh enough to stand out from the pony car herd, Ford euthanized that revamped model and skipped ahead to next year.
 The 2011 Mustang has been on sale since April, and while it may look only slightly different from the 2010 edition, it is much better in the places where even a little better counts. 
 Gone is the base Mustang's archaic 210-horsepower 4-liter iron-block V-6, replaced by an economical and effective all-aluminum V-6, which displaces 3.7 liters and pumps out an impressive 305 horsepower. 
 Also banished is the 2010 Mustang GT's yester-tech V-8, a 4.6-liter engine that made 315 horsepower. In its place is an all-new, all-rollicking 5-liter V-8 rated at 412 horses. This new V-8 is so entertaining that it deserves a Golden Globe.
 Along with new manual and automatic transmissions -- both with 6 forward speeds -- the engines represent the single greatest technological leap for the Mustang since it entered production 46 years ago. 
 And while the new V-8 deserves its own Irving Berlin ballad, the tune today is in the key of V-6.
 Let's put that engine's performance in perspective. It carries the same horsepower rating as the most muscular Mustang offered in 1998 -- the SVT Cobra with a 4.6-liter, dual-overhead cam, 32-valve V-8 that seemed exotic at the time. Yet the new Mustang manages 19 miles per gallon in the city and, when paired with the automatic transmission, 31 m.p.g. on the highway. That's 5 m.p.g. better than the highway rating for the base Mustang notchback way back in 1984. That tired old horse weighed 900 pounds less than today's larger pony, had a crummy 88-horsepower 4-cylinder under its hood and a gear-grinding 4-speed manual transmission.
 ''It's all about interdependency,'' said David Pericak, the 33-year-old chief engineer of the Mustang, explaining the talents of the new drivetrains. ''About finding solutions at each opportunity that would be more efficient.'' 
 Those optimized interdependencies let the car's Duratec V-6 perform as if it were actually two separate engines: one optimized for fuel economy at low engine speeds and partial throttle, and one that roars when allowed to spin toward its red line of 7,000 r.p.m. at full throttle. 
 Start up the new V-6 and it growls a bit through its new dual exhaust outlets. Put the shifter in D, touch the throttle pedal lightly and the Mustang moves out, well, tenderly. There's enough torque available from just off idle to motivate the car easily -- even the heavier Mustang convertible. But if kept below 4,000 r.p.m., the engine responds modestly. It doesn't feel as if it is making anything close to 305 horsepower. 
 Well, it isn't. 
 The Duratec V-6 may have dual overhead cams, four valves per cylinder and an aggressive 10.5:1 compression ratio, but it is tuned to putter around like a golf cart as long as it is driven with a light foot. The 280 pound-feet of peak torque isn't available until the engine is spinning at a lofty 4,250 r.p.m. and long before that the automatic transmission will shift itself into the highest gear possible (both fifth and sixth are overdrives) to keep the engine revs down. 
 In fact, at low speed the new engine doesn't feel much different from the superseded 4-liter V-6 that made its peak torque (240 pound-feet) at a relatively sedate 3,500 r.p.m. 
 In sum, at part throttle, the Duratec V-6 behaves like, say, a 190-horsepower engine. That is why it can return such solid fuel economy numbers. 
 Crush the throttle pedal, however, and all 305 horses show up ready to gallop. The Mustang's Duratec may not be equipped with of-the-moment technologies like direct injection (in contrast to the V-6 of its archrival, the Chevrolet Camaro), but the engine's variable camshaft timing system is very effective. 
 Once the tachometer needle sweeps past 4,000 r.p.m., the intake and exhaust cams transition to more aggressive settings and the V-6 breathes like Secretariat turning onto the front straight in the Belmont Stakes. By holding the transmission in each gear, it's possible to keep the engine boiling in the sweet spot between the torque peak at 4,250 r.p.m. and the dizzying 6,500 r.p.m. where it makes its maximum horsepower. 
 That is just 500 r.p.m. short of the V-6's red line, where the engine-control computer intervenes to keep the pistons from bursting through the hood. 
 But when this engine is making its full 305 horsepower it's getting nothing close to 31 m.p.g. Try 15, or 13, or maybe 12. This would be hard to calculate because holding those engine speeds for very long is virtually impossible except on a racetrack. 
 InsideLine.com measured a 2011 V-6 coupe with a manual gearbox running from 0 to 60 m.p.h. in 5.6 seconds. It also raced through the quarter mile in 13.9 seconds at 101.2 m.p.h. 
 While short of the performance of last year's Mustang GT (13.5 seconds at 102.9 m.p.h.) that car's V-8 had 315 horsepower and was rated at 24 m.p.g. on the highway. 
 (InsideLine has the 2011 Mustang GT ripping through the quarter mile in 13.0 seconds at 110.6 mph and sprinting from 0 to 60 m.p.h. in 4.8 seconds.)
 The test car was a $34,990 convertible with an automatic transmission, which according to Ford weighs 133 pounds more than the V-6 coupe. But despite the heft and the gearbox, the car felt athletic and easygoing. The V-6 lacks the low-end grunt that makes V-8s so much fun, but its combination of cruising parsimony and high-end thrills is tantalizing. This is not a car that feels compromised by its drivetrain. 
 Advanced as the new drivetrain is, however, there's a lot of throwback in the Mustang's engineering that defines both its charms and its limitations. 
 Soon to be the last rear-drive car sold in America with a solid rear axle, the Mustang handles and rides well, but the tail takes its time settling down after hitting a bump. 
 The MacPherson strut front suspension is more compliant, but the convertible's structure does shudder noticeably. The Pirelli PZero tires put a lot of rubber on the road, but the new electric power steering doesn't communicate to the driver much of what's happening down there.
 Though the convertible carries the same 19 m.p.g. rating for city driving, on the highway its extra weight knocks the estimate back a tick to 30 m.p.g.
 But on a top-up 133-mile trip back and forth between Santa Barbara and Santa Maria, with the cruise control set at 65 m.p.h. and the air-conditioning off, the Mustang burned just 4.2 gallons of regular-grade gas. My average for that trip of 31.3 m.p.g. is pretty good for a convertible that's 188 inches long and weighs 3,604 pounds.
 The Mustang's evolution has been slow. And by hewing closely to the original concept of the car, it has retained its character remarkably well. But for the first time, the Mustang has engines better than the rest of the car. It's time for Ford to shrink the Mustang some both in size and weight, and to give it a more sophisticated chassis. After all, making one leap forward doesn't mean there aren't more hurdles to clear.

HEADLINE: The President's Moment

 BODY:
If ever there was a test of President Obama's vision of government -- one that cannot solve all problems, but does what people cannot do for themselves -- it is this nerve-racking early summer of 2010, with oil spewing into the Gulf of Mexico and far too many Americans out of work for far too long.
 The country is frustrated and apprehensive and still waiting for Mr. Obama to put his vision into action. 
 The president cannot plug the leak or magically clean up the fouled Gulf of Mexico. But he and his administration need to do a lot more to show they are on top of this mess, and not perpetually behind the curve.
 It is well within Mr. Obama's power to keep his administration and Congressional Democrats focused on what the economy needs: jobs and stimulus. Voters are anxious about the deficit. But the president needs to tell them the truth -- that without more spending the economy could remain weak for a very long time.
 Unless Mr. Obama says it, no other politician will. Just the other day, the House passed an unemployment benefits extension from which Democrats, not Republicans, had stripped vital measures that would have helped lots of Americans, but did not close a tax loophole for billionaires.
 Americans need to know that Mr. Obama, whose coolness can seem like detachment, is engaged. This is not a mere question of presentation or stagecraft, although the White House could do better at both. (We cringed when he told the ''Today'' show that he had spent important time figuring out ''whose ass to kick'' about the spill. Everyone knew that answer on Day 2.) 
 Any assessment of the 44th president has to start with the fact that he took office under an extraordinary burden of problems created by President George W. Bush's ineptness and blind ideology. He has faced a stone wall of Republican opposition. And Mr. Obama has had real successes. He won a stimulus bill that helped avert a depression; he got a historic health care reform through Congress; the bitter memory of Mr. Bush's presidency is fading around the world.
 But a year and a half into this presidency, the contemplative nature that was so appealing in a candidate can seem indecisive in a president. His promise of bipartisanship seems naive. His inclination to hold back, then ride to the rescue, has sometimes made problems worse. 
 It certainly should not have taken days for Mr. Obama to get publicly involved in the oil spill, or even longer for his administration to start putting the heat on BP for its inadequate response and failure to inform the public about the size of the spill. (Each day, it seems, brings new revelations about the scope of the disaster.) It took too long for Mr. Obama to say that the Coast Guard and not BP was in charge of operations in the gulf and it's still not clear that is true.
 He should not have hesitated to suspend the expanded oil drilling program and he should have moved a lot faster to begin political and criminal investigations of the spill. If BP was withholding information, failing to cooperate or not providing the ships needed to process the oil now flowing to the surface, he should have told the American people and the world.
 These are matters of competence and leadership. This is a time for Mr. Obama to decisively show both.

HEADLINE: Oil Spill May Spur Action on Energy, Probably Not on Climate

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Images of gushing oil and dying pelicans in the Gulf of Mexico have stirred anger and agony in Washington. But are they enough to prod the Senate to act on long-delayed clean energy and climate change legislation?
 Energy, maybe. Climate, probably not. There is growing sentiment for a measure that penalizes BP, imposes higher costs and tougher regulations on offshore drillers and takes some steps toward reducing overall energy and petroleum consumption. 
 But despite the outrage over the spill, there appears to be limited appetite in the Senate for a broad-based effort to cap greenhouse gas emissions across the board. 
 Enacting that kind of legislation will require a grand bargain involving greater nuclear plant construction, concessions to the coal and utility industries, exemptions for major manufacturers and more, not less, domestic oil and gas drilling to attract Republican and moderate Democratic support.
 A coalition of 60 votes needed to overcome a filibuster is not yet in sight. In the words of Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a Republican who worked on a climate change bill for months before pronouncing it hopeless, ''There's nowhere near 60 votes to save the polar bear.''
 President Obama has said that the time has come to put a price on carbon dioxide pollution and vowed to find the votes for it this year. On Thursday, reacting to the defeat of a Republican plan to block the Environmental Protection Agency from regulating climate-changing emissions, the president again cited the urgent need to pass clean-energy and climate legislation.
 Behind the scenes, however, his advisers are working on a more modest package of energy-saving measures that stop well short of an effort to cap carbon emissions across all sectors of the economy.
 Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, has also signaled that he is open to patching together a series of limited energy measures rather than trying to push through a big climate bill like one sponsored by Senators John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut.
 Mr. Reid has asked top committee leaders for ideas on how to structure a package of energy initiatives to bring to the Senate floor in July, a clear sign that he does not believe that the Kerry-Lieberman bill has a chance to pass on its own. An aide said Mr. Reid would refine his strategy this week after meeting with the entire Senate Democratic caucus. Mr. Kerry is to deliver a plea for his broad measure at that session, aides said.
 Mr. Graham said that until the causes of the BP oil spill were identified and addressed, he would not vote for any sweeping climate change legislation. Instead, he endorsed a bill introduced last week by Senator Richard G. Lugar, Republican of Indiana, that sets higher fuel economy standards for cars, provides incentives for the development of alternative fuels and imposes stricter efficiency standards on buildings. The Lugar proposal includes no cap on carbon emissions but would seek to reduce greenhouse gas pollution through energy-saving steps.
 ''I'm not going to take a vote on the floor without a rational policy because we're in the middle of a major oil spill,'' Mr. Graham said. ''I'm not going to put that on the table until I find out what happened in the gulf and make sure it doesn't happen again.''
 Mr. Lieberman said the oil spill made it more urgent to enact comprehensive energy and climate change legislation. He acknowledged, however, that the measure he and Mr. Kerry sponsored lacked the votes it needs and would probably be carved up and served in combination with other bills like Mr. Lugar's.
 The oil spill, Mr. Lieberman said, has concentrated the capital's mind on energy policy and the problem of oil imports, but there is still no agreement on how to address it.
 ''The spill is significant, it is horrific, and it is the result of some negligence by business and government,'' he said. ''Ultimately, it will be used by both sides in the energy and climate debate. But the necessity of doing something in this session stands on its own merits.''
 Senate Republican leaders accused Democrats and the White House of trying to exploit the oil spill for political gain. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, said last week that the Democrats were using the calamity in the gulf to push what he described as a job-killing climate change bill.
 ''What I believe most of my members, if not all of them, and a substantial number of Democrats in the United States Senate will not be interested in is seizing on the oil spill in the gulf and using that as a rationale, if you will, for passing a national energy tax referred to down here at the White House as cap and trade,'' Mr. McConnell said on Thursday after meeting with Mr. Obama and top White House advisers.
 Environmental advocates who have pushed hard for years for climate change legislation said they believed that the BP leak could tip the scales in favor of action. What form that action takes is still murky.
 ''The oil spill is a disaster, but I think it increases the likelihood of a bill being enacted this year,'' said Dan Lashof, director the Natural Resources Defense Council climate center. ''There is still a question whether a bill that passes the Senate will be effective in responding both to the immediate needs to tighten drilling regulation as well as the larger issue of actually ending our addiction to oil and getting us on a clean energy path.''

HEADLINE: DEMOCRAT IN CHIEF?

BYLINE: By MATT BAI. 
Matt Bai is a national political columnist for The Times and a regular contributor to the magazine.

 BODY:
A year and a half after they sat, shivering and awestruck, on a January morning and listened to the sounds of a million cheers careering off the marble walls of the Capitol, the Democrats who work under the dome can feel those same walls closing in fast. Throughout the dismal spring, it seemed as if every visiting delegation that drove up in a coach bus -- Main Street merchants, family farmers, Rotarians and Elks -- arrived with tales of angst and unrest back home. Every well-paid pollster who came through the door brought with him a stack of surveys and focus-group memos, each more dispiriting than the last, numbers portending an emphatic rejection of the majority in this fall's elections. Every new thickly bound jobs report landed with a sickening thud on the desks of committee chairmen -- a reminder that, despite modest improvements, time was running out to change people's minds about the direction of the economy. 
 And then there was the president -- their president -- who for 17 months had cajoled them into taking tough votes on stimulus spending, on the trading of carbon emissions, on health care. Barack Obama, the postpartisan president. He continued to go out and shake his head disbelievingly at ''the culture of Washington,'' which to the Democrats in the House sounded as if he were saying that his own party was the problem, as if somehow the Democratic majorities in Congress hadn't managed to navigate the bulk of his ambitious agenda past a blockade of Republican vessels, their ship shredded by cannon fire. And all this while the president's own approval ratings fell below 50 percent -- an ominous sign, historically speaking, for a majority party.
 This frustration among Democrats was bound to find an outlet, and that's what happened at a meeting in Nancy Pelosi's conference room at the end of April to discuss the party's election-year message. Around three sides of the table were close to a dozen Democratic leaders in the House. On the remaining side sat David Axelrod, the president's senior adviser and message-molder, along with two other White House operatives: Jim Messina, the deputy chief of staff, and Stephanie Cutter, a senior aide to the president.
 Chris Van Hollen, the Maryland congressman in charge of House campaigns this fall, and James Clyburn, the Democratic whip and an Obama ally, complained to Axelrod about the president's unrelenting assault on Washington rather than on Republicans specifically, according to three people who were in the room. ''A 'Washington is broken' message doesn't help incumbents running for Congress,'' Van Hollen pleaded with the aides.
 Axelrod said the House leaders needed to listen to what the president was actually saying out there -- Obama was, in fact, drawing sharp contrasts between his party and the Republicans. But Axelrod also informed them that the president would continue to acknowledge the general discontent with Washington in his public comments, in the hope that he might help lessen what White House aides sometimes call the ''toxicity'' in the air. He would make the case for Democrats by reminding voters of all that he and his party had been able to accomplish legislatively, even without Republican help. Washington was broken, and if you told people what you were doing to fix it, then they would side with you. ''You're not going to will it away -- the discontent,'' Axelrod said. ''The most important message is that we took on difficult problems, and they sat on the sidelines and rooted for failure.''
 This didn't satisfy the Congressional leaders, who thought the message had to be more about their ''fighting for the middle class'' versus the indifference of Republicans. They wanted Obama to go out there and tell the public that installing a Republican Congress would be like climbing into a time machine and teleporting right back to the Bush era. Privatizing Social Security, ending Medicare, repealing the health care law and reinstating tax cuts for the wealthy -- that's what the Republicans were proposing, and the lawmakers said they needed Obama to drive that point home with the electorate.
 Voices rose and drowned out other voices as the meeting grew tense. ''The fact is,'' Pelosi said, addressing herself to Axelrod, ''that the longer you say Washington is broken, and you've been saying that for 18 months, the more that becomes the story.''
 When the other lawmakers departed for a vote, Pelosi remained with the White House aides and some staff members. The speaker strolled down to Axelrod's end of the table and delivered the message bluntly. Obama, she insisted, needed to be cutting and clear about the choice between parties that he was asking voters to make. Did the president really think he could enhance his own standing with the public by criticizing his Democratic allies?
 ''Look, if the president could take 10 points off his numbers to give you 10 seats -- '' Axelrod began, referring to Obama's approval ratings.
 ''That's not what we want,'' Pelosi said, cutting him off. ''That doesn't do any of us any good.'' In the end, Axelrod pointedly declined to say that the president would stop acknowledging the failures of both parties in Washington, but the message was received. In the weeks that followed, Obama intensified his rhetoric about Republicans, playing to his constituencies on the Hill as well as to the audiences he was addressing.
 This was not only a conversation about the fall elections but also an airing of grievances that have been building slowly since the opening days of the administration, when Obama sided with Republicans by condemning some of the more easily caricatured provisions of the stimulus bill, like money for family planning and to restore the National Mall. Perhaps the most significant moment in Obama's State of the Union address came when, after chastising Congress for its extreme partisanship, he cut off applause from the Democratic side of the aisle. ''I'm speaking to both parties now,'' Obama scolded.
 For Democrats in Congress, what Obama does over the next several months -- and how passionately he does it -- will answer some unresolved questions about the kind of party leader he aspires to be. For most of George W. Bush's presidency, he and his resident Machiavelli, Karl Rove, made little secret of their grand plan to sculpture a partisan majority that would endure for decades, enabling Republicans to reshape American society. After Democrats took a sledgehammer to those ambitions in 2006 and 2008, expanding their own sphere of dominance from coastal cities into the suburbs of the Midwest and the Rocky Mountain states and even into the South, many of the party's leaders in Congress talked openly of their own lasting, Rooseveltian realignment.
 Unlike his predecessor and some of his own political allies, however, Obama has never betrayed much interest in building political empires. Obama ran on the notion of transcending partisan distinctions, rather than making them permanent, and the political identity that enabled him to draw millions of new voters into the process two years ago is both intensely personal and self-contained. It's not clear that Obama can translate his appeal among disaffected voters into support for a party and its aging Washington establishment. Nor is it clear, as he looks ahead to 2012, how hard he's going to try.
 It is difficult to overstate the role that 1994 plays in the tormented psyche of the Democratic Party. For those who went through them, those midterms were less a bunch of elections than a single, sudden event that they never saw coming until it was on them, like something out of ''War of the Worlds.'' Most of the Democrats who woke up firmly in control of American government on Nov. 8, 1994, had no memory of a time when they didn't make all the laws, and they couldn't really conceive of it; by nightfall, 40 years of near-total Democratic dominance in both houses of Congress had been washed away. The costs, for years afterward, were too painful to fully contemplate. Without the voter uprising of 1994, there would have been no Speaker Gingrich, no impeachment and almost certainly no George W. Bush, who, by winning election as the governor of Texas, found himself swept into office that year along with a lot of other political neophytes who might otherwise have disappeared into political obscurity.
 Republicans in 1994 gained a net total of 54 House seats and 8 Senate seats and emerged with a majority of governors for the first time in more than 20 years, and state legislatures for the first time in a half century. This year, they need to gain 40 House seats and 8 Senate seats to regain control. Taking back the House is eminently doable; taking the Senate is remote but hardly unthinkable. Contempt for Washington -- personified by incumbent candidates in both parties -- is everywhere, as evidenced by this year's early primaries in May, in which two sitting senators (Robert Bennett of Utah and Arlen Specter in Pennsylvania) were knocked off and a Republican senatorial candidate in Kentucky who had the blessing of the national party was sunk. The glimmer of hope here for Democrats is that the antiestablishment fervor in a wide number of Republican primaries is likely to yield more than a few nominees who are on the extreme end of the ideological spectrum (Rand Paul in Kentucky, say), making the Republican alternative a harder sell for a lot of moderate and unaffiliated voters.
 Meanwhile, Democratic governors are bracing for their own losses. The effect of a drubbing at the state level, while likely to garner less attention than what happens in Washington, could be devastating for Democrats, just as it proved to be 16 years ago. Governors have generally proved to be the intellectual catalysts for both parties, and it's not incidental that four of the five presidents immediately preceding Obama sprang from their ranks. Parties that fail to hold governors' mansions also fail to develop compelling candidates for national office.
 No matter how similar conditions throughout the country now may seem, 2010 really isn't all that comparable to 1994, if only because the underlying forces that are endangering Democrats this year -- that is, the structural trends in the electorate -- are quite different. The 1994 elections marked the culmination of a decades-long transformation. For 30 years before then, since the triumph of the civil rights agenda, Democratic strongholds in the South and in the working-class Midwest had been teetering toward the Republicans. Bill Clinton's missteps no doubt hastened this process, but so did redistricting based on the 1990 Census, after which Democrats were assured safe, urban seats in minority districts while whiter, more conservative districts were created in the suburbs. The 1994 campaigns were the first waged on this map in a nonpresidential election year, and it all but guaranteed that many longtime Democrats would lose.
 This year's challenge for Democrats has more to do with the normal cycles of what you might call tidal politics. (And not the kind created by oil gushing into the Gulf of Mexico.) Think of presidential years as the high tide coming in. That is, a successful presidential candidate usually, though not always, carries with him a wave of Congressional seats, depending on the scale of the victory. During the off years, the tide generally goes out again, and the president's party is bound to lose some of those marginal seats. Only two presidents since 1862 have seen their parties gain House seats in their first midterm election. One was Franklin D. Roosevelt, whose Republican opponents were still reeling from that whole Great Depression thing. The other was George W. Bush, in part because of fears of terrorism, but also because he had been elected without a plurality of the popular vote in 2000, meaning he hadn't carried a wave of marginal congressmen into office to begin with. If the tide doesn't come in, then it doesn't go out, either.
 In 2006 and 2008, Democrats did something that had not been done in American politics since the Great Depression, which is to string together two consecutive ''wave'' elections -- roughly defined as a gain of at least 20 seats in the House of Representatives. They gained a total of 55 House seats and 12 seats in the Senate; the tide came in twice and with unusual strength. That means that some significant number of the Democrats elected in the last two cycles, to put it bluntly, really don't have much business holding their seats in the first place. Either their districts normally trend Republican -- 49 Democratic House members were elected from districts that voted for John McCain -- or they themselves probably wouldn't have cleared the threshold for a successful candidacy in a more conventional election year. (Eric Massa, the former Democratic representative from New York who admitted to the intense tickling of a staff member at a birthday party, comes to mind.)
 Neither Obama nor any other Democratic president was ever going to keep the tide from leaving the beach in 2010, and certainly not with the economy lurching slowly from awful to just plain bad. The only question is whether the Democrats will lose control in at least one chamber of Congress, an outcome that might paralyze Obama's presidency and thrust his party into a prolonged depression of its own.
 Of the five living Americans who have served as president, Obama is the only one who never worked as some kind of party strategist. George H. W. Bush oversaw the Republican National Committee for a time, and his son, George W. Bush, played a pivotal role in the headquarters of his father's failed re-election bid in 1992. Bill Clinton got his start in politics helping to run George McGovern's campaign in Texas. Even Jimmy Carter, who was thought to disdain tactical politics, was the chairman of the Democratic Party's national midterm campaign in 1974. These men rose through their party organizations (in Bush's case, this was more about a famous name than it was about holding a series of jobs), and they were intimate with the relatively cozy world of organizers, donors and local power brokers, the few thousand activists who control the workings of a political party.
 Obama did his door-to-door campaigning as a community organizer, but he never worked in party politics until he ran for office, and as a presidential aspirant he never bothered with trying to remake his party or modernize its message in the same way that Reagan (a spokesman for the conservative movement) or Clinton (a leader of the centrist New Democrats) did. Other than to assert (dubiously, perhaps) that he wasn't a ''triangulator'' like the Clintons, Obama did not run against the party establishment, as other candidates had before, but with indifference toward it.
 In this way, as in many others, Obama is emblematic of the generation that found its political consciousness in the years after Vietnam and Watergate, when the ruling classes of both parties lost their credibility. Carter, Clinton and George W. Bush were presidents rooted in their parties who went out of their way to cultivate outsider pedigrees. Obama, a good 15 years younger than our last two boomer presidents, is the opposite; he is a genuine outsider who spends a fair amount of energy reassuring Democrats that he really does care about the organization.
 ''Fundamentally, I just think he wants to be bigger than that,'' says Cornell Belcher, who was one of Obama's pollsters during the 2008 campaign. ''It gets back to being a transformational leader. A party leader isn't about transformation.''
 Obama's advisers have spoken of his brand, which is a stand-in for the party identity that defined other presidencies. Obama's brand is about inclusivity, transcendence, a generational break from stale dogmas. Inevitably, Obama's brand management runs up against the culture of his party. State activists are sometimes told their requests for the president to appear at a typical political event, in some ballroom with room dividers or at the local labor hall, aren't going to fly. Aides know that if they bring that kind of thing to Obama, he'll ask, ''Can't we do any better than that?'' As a rule, Obama no longer speaks at the traditional Jefferson-Jackson dinners where state Democratic parties gather to raise money from the faithful. ''For what?'' a senior aide responded when I asked why. ''To talk to the same people he already has?'' Obama prefers venues, preferably outdoors or in large theaters, where he can reach voters who aren't party regulars. He generally refuses to do ''robo-calls,'' those ubiquitous, recorded messages in which a politician asks you to go out and vote for the party. ''He's got a practical objection to them, which is that they're irritating,'' Axelrod explained to me.
 While Obama attended four times the number of fund-raising events that Bill Clinton did during his first year in office, he garnered a fraction of the contributions. ''He is the worst Washington fund-raiser in the history of presidents,'' a White House aide proudly admitted to me a few months back. All of this exasperates operatives on the Hill who are obsessed with keeping other Democrats in office, and who think maybe Obama should be a little more obsessed with it too. ''When you go to the D.N.C., his picture is on that wall,'' a longtime strategist who is working for a Congressional campaign told me. ''There's a reason.''
 Unlike other modern presidents, Obama, who was elected largely on the strength of an unprecedented outpouring of small-dollar contributions, has no Terry McAuliffe, someone whose unspoken job it is to make sure the party's donors are kept happy and engaged. David Plouffe is his strategist, Axelrod a message guy, Valerie Jarrett a kind of ambassador and protector -- but none of them have raised huge sums of cash from big contributors, and none of them are nearly as devoted to the party's prospects as they are to the president. In fact, Obama seems to have outsourced much of the traditional party-leadership role to Rahm Emanuel and Joe Biden, the two principal Washington insiders in his administration, both of whom seem better suited to the role.
 Unlike Clinton, who loved the game of politics almost as much as the governance, Obama doesn't pore over polling data or study the shaded zones on electoral maps. For that he has Emanuel, his chief of staff, who was the chief strategist behind the Democratic takeover of the House in 2006 and who knows as much about the individual Congressional districts in play as any operative in town. Because of this history, Emanuel occupies a unique position in the West Wing and one that places him apart from the close circle of loyalists who have been alongside Obama from the first day of his presidential campaign. Emanuel, too, is devoted to the president, but he also maintains close relationships with dozens of the House members he recruited, and friends say he anguishes, more than Obama or other White House advisers, about the possibility of losing their seats.
 He's also not above getting involved in party primaries; it was Emanuel, according to the White House's own report last month, who initiated the effort to try to nudge Joe Sestak, the Pennsylvania congressman, out of the race for the Democratic Senate nomination in that state so that Arlen Specter could run unopposed. Sestak, of course, stayed in the race and won. Stories about potential job offers to Sestak and another primary challenger, Colorado's Andrew Romanoff, have attracted attention from the news media and from Republicans, which speaks to the importance of the Obama brand in this election year. Such informal overtures are a standard and predictable part of politics in both parties (Karl Rove was relentless in trying to clear certain primary fields during the midterm elections of 2002). But Obama has cast himself above such things, which is why stories of tawdry favor-swapping have a resonance in Washington that they would not otherwise have.
 Meanwhile, although Obama has to this point headlined only a handful of fund-raising events dedicated to House members, Biden has happily attended more than 15 of them, with more on the calendar. This is partly because the loquacious vice president has yet to meet the podium he doesn't want to fling himself upon, but also because, in a lot of the more conservative, working-class districts in the South and Midwest, Obama's approval ratings are considerably lower than they are in national surveys. In these parts of the country, Biden -- plain-talking, profane and nobody's idea of a closet Muslim -- may not only be a more enthusiastic partisan than the president but a more persuasive one as well.
 If the president isn't going to be his party's chief strategist or its most prolific fund-raiser, then aides say there are two things he will do for his party that are, ultimately, more important -- and that are, not coincidentally, in keeping with the brand. The first is to remind voters that Democrats didn't create the current economic morass. As Rahm Emanuel told me when we sat down in April, ''The American people know overwhelmingly that he inherited a'' -- and here Emanuel used a word I can't repeat -- ''sandwich.'' (Suffice it to say the sandwich wasn't pastrami.) ''They know that. They don't need to be educated. I believe it's worth reminding them of the scale, size and scope of the'' -- that word again -- ''sandwich we got.
 ''Ultimately,'' Emanuel went on, ''everything about politics -- everything, everything -- is about choice. The choice is not about what we did versus the ideal. The choice is about what we did versus what we inherited. We inherited George Bush's Great Recession, and we broke its back.'' Emanuel is fond of talking about breaking the body parts of things -- backs, necks, etc. ''We inherited the financial ruins of Wall Street, and we fixed them. We inherited a country in the worst fiscal condition it has ever been in, and we are in the beginning stages of finding a consensus to turn that around. But the option of going back is not an option, and we're in the early stages of digging out of the ditch we got handed.''
 Emanuel said that Obama would continue to spend a block of every month on the road, as he has since January, when voters in Massachusetts elected Scott Brown, a Republican, to what had been Ted Kennedy's seat in the Senate. ''We're getting him out of here, out of Washington,'' he said. ''I want him less here and more in the country, and when he's out in the country, more in touch with people.''
 The second thing Obama can do for Democrats, in the view of the White House, is to change the way they run their campaigns. Democrats running for the House and the Senate, like the party's presidential candidates, have generally relied almost exclusively on the unions and other constituency groups to get out the vote, using paid phone banks and door-knockers. Starting out, Obama didn't have that option. His party's existing organizational structure was largely beholden to Hillary Clinton through the 2008 primaries, so Obama recruited an army of volunteers, many of them previously uninvolved in any kind of party politics, who ended up organizing blocks and precincts in their towns, lobbying neighbors door to door on Obama's behalf and squeezing out the vote on Election Day. It was, in effect, much like the volunteer-driven network employed by Bush's campaign in 2004, although less centralized and more Internet-focused.
 Obama emerged from the campaign having assembled what was essentially an alternative apparatus to the party itself -- a closely guarded, state-by-state list of more than 10 million names, many of them door-knockers, phone-bankers, letter-writers and small-dollar donors. This network, loyal to the president but not necessarily to his party, helped Obama amass upward of $300 million for the general election and registered millions of new voters for him. The shorthand for all this, in Obama's orbit, is ''the new politics,'' meaning that what Obama created is the replacement for the special-interest politics of the last century. The new politics are tactical, encompassing no specific ideological agenda, although most of the more ardent adherents tend to consider themselves more liberal than the party establishment. Obama's advisers say they believe they can, at least in some measure, bequeath the new politics to the party itself. And their message to Congressional Democrats running this year is that if they don't adopt the tactics of the Obama campaign, they're probably going to lose.
 To understand why this might just be true, it helps to revisit the tactics that made Obama only the fourth Democratic president in history -- Jackson, Roosevelt, Johnson and Obama -- to claim more than 51 percent of the vote. There were, roughly speaking, two ways in which Obama managed to change the electoral calculus for Democrats. First, if exit polls can be believed, he carried 52 percent of independent voters, outpacing John McCain by eight points. The other major component was to simply create more voters -- and this is where the new politics were especially important. Obama's campaign team maintains that its volunteers had a lot to do with getting some 15 million to 20 million first-time voters out to the polls, and about 7 in 10 of those voters cast their ballots for Obama. The campaign pulled more black voters, Hispanic voters and white college-age voters into the process than most analysts previously thought possible, which made a crucial difference in more conservative states like Indiana, North Carolina and Virginia.
 Twenty months later, if independents haven't deserted the party altogether, then they certainly seem to be gathering their things and saying their goodbyes. The progressive policy group Third Way, analyzing exit-poll data from last year's governor's races in Virginia and New Jersey and the special Senate election in Massachusetts in January, found that only about a third of independents in all three states voted Democratic, compared with about 54 percent who voted for Obama in 2008. According to the latest polling from the Pew Research Center, Obama's standing among independents has dropped from a high of 63 percent early in his presidency to about 47 percent now.
 That would seem to leave only one way for Democrats to avoid being swept away on the receding tide, and that's to turn out some sizable portion of those first time-voters from 2008 -- the ''surge voters,'' as his aides like to refer to them. This was hard enough to do in a presidential year, but in a midterm cycle, when generally only the most reliable voters bother to participate, it feels almost wishful. The disappointing turnout among these younger, more educated and minority voters in New Jersey and Virginia in 2009 jolted a lot of Democrats who assumed, after 2008, that Obama's victory somehow permanently changed the electoral math.
 ''What we've seen over the course of Obama's time in office so far is that his constituencies have been relatively sleepy compared to his opposition,'' Andrew Kohut, the president of the Pew Research Center, told me. ''Voting is a habit. The problem with these people'' -- meaning the surge voters -- ''is that they came out for the first time, and so they're nonhabitual voters. Not only does Obama have to do what he did back in '08 in terms of getting them to come out in greater numbers, but he has to get them to shake off their drowsiness.''
 The chief architect and spiritual leader of the new politics is David Plouffe, who retains a kind of mystical aura among Obama's campaign confidants, probably because he was the only member of the inner circle to decline a role in the administration. His record remains unsullied by the inevitable failures of governance. This is why, days after Scott Brown's victory, the White House let it be known that Plouffe would be coming back as an ''outside adviser'' for the midterms. The announcement of Plouffe's return was meant to head off a panic among jittery congressmen and senators who worried that the president had lost control of the political environment. Plouffe personified the notion (true or not) that Obama really did have a plan for 2010, and absent that, it might have been much harder to get a lot of vulnerable Democrats to cast difficult votes for health care reform.
 At 43, Plouffe is a boyish-looking, somewhat-reclusive operative who makes little secret of his disdain for Washington. When I visited him in April at the K Street building where he rents a one-room office but rarely actually visits, he seemed intent on dispelling the impression that the White House itself wanted to create last January. ''I think my role was described in a way that was sort of overheated after Massachusetts,'' Plouffe told me. ''You know how Washington is. It's always, what kind of change is going to happen in the aftermath of a setback? That's just kind of a ritual in Washington. And so in this case, me spending a little more time on things became part of that.
 ''We're not running these campaigns,'' Plouffe declared, lightly pounding a conference table, surrounded by signed posters of Obama. ''It's the candidates, most important, the consultants and the staff -- they're running the campaigns. They're allocating the resources. They're executing their strategy every day. And the notion that the White House was going to come in and take over the running of these campaigns is just asinine. It's just not grounded in reality.''
 Even so, Plouffe says he has been thinking about how to hold the surge voters since the day Obama was elected. Within weeks after the campaign ended, Plouffe took the grass-roots campaign organization known as Obama for America and renamed it Organizing for America, moving the entire operation into the first floor of the renovated Democratic National Committee building, in the space set aside for the party's nominee during presidential campaign years. The idea was to transform Obama's list of activists and small-dollar contributors into a neighborhood-by-neighborhood organization that could be mobilized to support his policy agenda, starting with energy and health care.
 The job of integrating O.F.A., as it is known, into the Democratic National Committee fell to Tim Kaine, then the governor of Virginia, whom Obama named party chairman in January 2009. Kaine was an early endorser of Obama's and is a devotee of the new politics, and anyone who spends much time in the national headquarters today will quickly realize that, under his direction, O.F.A. has virtually supplanted the party structure. O.F.A. is sending some 300 paid organizers to the states -- several times the number the national party hired for the 2006 midterms under Kaine's predecessor, Howard Dean. When Democratic officials inside the headquarters say ''we,'' they are more often than not talking about O.F.A. rather than the party organization that existed before.
 The transition from being an outside-the-establishment campaign organization to being an inside-the-establishment policy promoter has not been an easy one for O.F.A. The first year was marked by widespread frustration, as volunteers tried to get their heads around the arcane changes in, say, the health care bill as it meandered its way through Congress, while simultaneously being urged not to attack members of their own party who wavered on the agenda. ''Sometimes the lack of tangibility can be distressing for people,'' Plouffe told me. ''Because they'll go out there and say: 'I worked hard. I had a press conference. I had all these people write letters to the editor. And my member of Congress voted against health care. It didn't seem to matter.' That's reality, unfortunately.
 ''That's what's good about elections,'' Plouffe added -- that volunteers know how they can affect the outcome. ''If they go out there and talk to 10 new voters, and 4 of them say yes, they're inclined to vote, then you can take that to the bank, because you know that's important, and you understand how that fits into the whole thing.'' The mission for O.F.A. in this election year, Plouffe told me, is to re-energize enough of Obama's base to subtly shift the math in enough competitive districts to minimize Democratic losses. Volunteers will do this one phone call and one door-knock at a time, armed with voter files containing the names of those first-time registrants who might be compelled to vote again. Kaine announced in April that the party was making a $50 million commitment to its Congressional, Senate and gubernatorial candidates, but only about $20 million of that money will come in cash, to be divided among the various campaign committees. The rest will be transferred in kind, through on-the-ground organization -- and, in that way, Plouffe and his team may end up directing more of the midterm campaigns than he'd like to admit.
 ''I'm not going to suggest we're going to change the electorate like we did in 2008,'' Plouffe said, tamping down expectations again. ''But I think we can have some impact on the electorate in November. So perhaps it's a shade younger, or perhaps it's a little more African-American than it's been in past off years.''
 For Plouffe, the unstated goal is to lay the groundwork for Obama's re-election campaign in 2012. By trying to build up volunteer networks in states like Indiana and Virginia and Colorado, all states where Democrats have crucial Congressional and Senate races this fall, Plouffe and his operatives are looking not just to protect their Congressional majorities but also to reconnect with the surge voters whom Obama brought into the process, in hopes that they won't just get bored with politics and wander away in the years between presidential campaigns, never to return.
 This time, however, O.F.A. volunteers won't be asking their friends and neighbors to vote for a young, electric, racially transcendent presidential candidate. Instead, in a lot of districts, they'll be asking their friends and neighbors to vote for some aging member of Congress who has been on the ballot 10 times already, which is a considerably harder sell. ''Let's be clear -- these are not Democratic voters,'' Cornell Belcher, the Obama campaign pollster, cautioned me. ''They're Obama voters.'' The lesson that Plouffe and his operation took away from the dismal 2009 elections is that Obama can act like a matchmaker of sorts, introducing the party's candidates to new voters and vouching for their intentions, but it's only going to matter if the candidates themselves embrace the so-called new politics. What that means, practically speaking, is that the White House is urging candidates to divert a fair amount of their time and money -- traditionally used for buying TV ads and rallying core constituencies -- to courting volunteers and voters who haven't generally been reliable Democrats.
 This is not what members of Congress or their campaign managers are trained to do, and it has created something of a cultural chasm between the White House and the party apparatus. There is a strong generational component here. With some exceptions, Obama's passion for organizing finds more enthusiasm among candidates closer to the president's age and newer to politics (candidates like Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado), while older Democrats have a harder time imagining that a bunch of volunteers and a dozen virtual town-hall meetings are going to matter more than labor endorsements and some killer 30-second spots. Longtime party strategists also point out, fairly, that Obama raised such an absurd amount of money during his presidential campaign that he never had to choose between, say, TV ads and door-to-door canvassers in any given state; he had both, and in record numbers. Few, if any, House or Senate candidates will have that kind of good fortune, which means, for most Democrats, that embracing the new politics also means cutting back on other bedrock campaign tactics.
 One respected Democratic Senate aide who is skeptical of the Plouffe strategy suggested to me that Obama's emphasis on O.F.A., like the controversial ''50-state strategy'' that Howard Dean pursued as party chairman, was just the latest fad to distract the party headquarters from its more fundamental mission of raising cash and airing ads. ''The D.N.C. has allowed itself to become a Rorschach test of whatever politics is at the time,'' the aide told me. '' 'We are whatever you want us to be' is the new politics. What we've gotten away from is being there for the campaigns.''
 By Democratic Party standards, this is a relatively muted internal disagreement. But it nonetheless points to the emergence of rival schools of thought within the party when it comes to Obama's importance as a party leader. Some see him as having transformed both the electorate and the nature of campaigning in what could be a lasting and fundamental way, meaning that things are possible now -- both in terms of liberal governance and winning elections -- that did not seem possible before. Others view 2008 mostly as a cathartic election that had more to do with conditions in the country than with Obama's peculiar magic, and they don't think the party should assume that there are millions of new voters out there who can be tapped if you just knock on the right doors. These two worldviews coexist uneasily among the party's elected officials and candidates, young and old, in every part of the country -- sometimes just hours apart.
 Virginia's second Congressional district winds around the state's easternmost shore and leaps across the Chesapeake Bay to Virginia Beach and Norfolk, home to the largest Naval basein the world. In 2008, Obama carried the district by a mere two points on his way to an impressive victory in the state. If you get on the road and drive about 100 miles due west, you'll hit the fifth Congressional district, which encompasses the fading manufacturing cities of Martinsville and Danville, along with a lot of old tobacco towns and some of the highest unemployment rates in the state. Here the election tilted the other way, but again it was close, with McCain winning by about the same two-point margin. In both districts, however, the surge vote in 2008 was strong enough to unseat Republican representatives and replace them with a pair of novice Democrats whom no one had given much of a chance until the final weeks: Glenn Nye in the second district and Tom Perriello in the fifth.
 On paper, Nye and Perriello were remarkably similar candidates. Both men were just 34 when they ran, their birthdays exactly one month apart. Nye is a Georgetown graduate who worked for the federal government in the Balkans and Iraq. Perriello is a product of Yale's law school and a former human rights lawyer in West Africa. Both won in mostly white, historically conservative districts with sizable African-American voting blocs and similar per-capita incomes. Both Nye and Perriello will tell you that the voters who elected them are tired of ideological barriers and voted for a new kind of pragmatism.
 ''They wanted to get away from the model of just voting the party line and doing what the party leadership says,'' Nye told me during a recent conversation in his Washington office. ''When I talked to people back home, what I heard consistently is that we'd really like someone who uses their own conscience and their own mind to make decisions that they think are best for the district.'' Perriello told me much the same thing when I visited him in his district, as we slogged through a mix of mud and manure at a dairy farm to show how stimulus money was being used to make energy out of dung. ''There was a decidedly anti-ideological component to the vote,'' Perriello said. ''It was a reaction to the ideological extremism of the Bush administration, replacing it with someone who didn't fit a traditionally liberal space but who represented a more pragmatic approach.''
 And yet, Nye and Perriello have very different ideas about what pragmatism means. Nye, who practices moderation in the mold of a Southern blue-dog Democrat, voted for the stimulus package early on, but since then he has broken with Obama on some of the administration's most pressing domestic initiatives, including the energy plan and health care reform. Perriello, whose 727-vote margin of victory in 2008 was the tightest in the country, has instead been one of the more tireless advocates for Obama's agenda. When he has criticized the president and his advisers, it has been because Perriello sees the White House as insufficiently courageous in taking on Wall Street and unemployment.
 The distance between Nye and Perriello on the Obama agenda can be explained, in part, by some of the mundane realities of politics. Obviously the two congressmen harbor some different ideological convictions. And their districts are shaded a bit more differently than they appear on paper; Nye's district is stamped with a military kind of conservatism that stresses national security and self-reliance, while Perriello's leans more toward the populist variety. But there's something deeper going on here, too, a localized version of the greater confusion that surrounds the party two years after Obama's election. When all those Obama surge voters flooded the polling places and voted for change, what exactly were they voting for? Did postpartisanship and pragmatism mean the less ideological, more fiscally responsible vision of government that Nye thought it meant? Or was it about the progressive, ambitious approach that Perriello represents?
 It's no accident that even those who surfed in on the Obama wave should have such different notions of what it signified. Obama himself never really settled the point. During the campaign, he alternated seamlessly between two sides of his political persona: the postpartisan reformer and the progressive revivalist. On one hand, reaching out to disaffected and independent voters, he vowed to dispense with the culture wars and leave behind the 20th-century orthodoxies of both parties. At the same time, he inspired a hopeful frenzy among liberals who assumed that he was, at heart, one of them. Propelled through the fall campaign by a cratering economy and his opponent's weak campaign, Obama was never really compelled to reconcile these two ideals. The vague notion of ''change,'' whatever kind of change that meant, seemed good enough for an anxious electorate.
 Throughout his first year in office -- perhaps out of necessity, given the near depression he inherited, but also under pressure from older leaders in his own party who spoke openly of another New Deal -- Obama tilted toward progressive revival. Since the Massachusetts vote, however, Obama seems to be pushing back in the other direction, moving to reclaim his reformist appeal. In recent months, he has renewed his overtures to Republican lawmakers, thrown his support behind nuclear power and, most significant, established a commission on fiscal reform -- all of which probably amounts to an acknowledgment that he can't continue to hemorrhage confidence among the independent voters who were an integral part of his election.
 In a sense, the 2010 elections, like pretty much all midterm elections, represent the coda to the presidential vote that preceded them. What happens in closely contested Congressional districts this fall -- whether the Obama voters of 2008 will come out again to show their support for a Tom Perriello, whether they will re-elect a Glenn Nye, whether they will punish either man for his decisions -- will go a long way toward clarifying which of the two Obamas, the reformer or the revivalist, most voters really thought they were getting. And that, in turn, will give Plouffe and the rest of the president's inner circle a clearer sense of where the country is heading toward 2012, as they prepare to break out the maps and fire up the e-mail lists for what they expect to be the final campaign of Obama's brief and improbable career.
 Even given the strong possibility that Democrats could lose control of at least one chamber of Congress this fall, Obama's aides seem confident about his re-election, in part because they are drawing some inspiration from another midterm election year that isn't quite yet ancient history -- not 1994, but 1982. According to Gallup, Ronald Reagan's average approval rating during the fifth quarter of his first term -- the period between January and April 1982 -- was 46.3 percent, just south of Obama's average mark of 48.8 percent over the same period in 2010. Reagan's ratings, too, fell in close relation to the nation's rising unemployment rate during his second year in office, as the economic recovery he had promised took hold sluggishly. The voters punished Reagan's party in the 1982 midterm elections, but in a far less catastrophic way than they did during Clinton's first term.
 Obama's advisers say it is only a matter of months before voters begin to feel in their daily lives the steady, if unspectacular, improvement that has been showing up in recent economic reports -- and by which time, presumably, the leak off the Louisiana coast should be plugged. The question no one can answer is whether a lift in public optimism might come in time for Democrats to reap any benefit in November. Just about every strategist of either party in Washington will tell you that the best indicator of whether the voters are growing less skeptical -- and, thus, of whether Democrats can survive the November elections intact -- can be found in the president's approval rating. There is a political theorem that illustrates this, supported by data from past elections and often repeated by Democrats now, and it goes like this: If the president's approval rating is over 50 percent in the fall, then his party will suffer only moderately. If his rating is under 50 percent, however, then the pounding at the polls is likely to be a memorable one.
 There is a corollary to this theorem, which Rahm Emanuel explained to me when we talked in April. For every point that Obama's approval rating dips below 50 percent, Emanuel said, there are probably four or five more House districts that will swing into the Republican column, and vice versa. Emanuel reeled off a series of polls from that week -- some that had the president just under 50 percent but one, from The Washington Post and ABC News, that put the number at 54 -- in a way that made it clear that he was, if not obsessed with these numbers, then clearly transfixed by them. ''It does matter where he is,'' Emanuel told me. ''For the midterms, if you're at 50, that's a different scenario for the president then if you're at 47.''
 The thing about political theorems, unlike mathematical theorems, is that they are predictive until the moment they aren't. There are cultural and social departure points in the life of a country, markers between one period and the next, that can be fully appreciated only in hindsight, and that render old formulas suddenly obsolete. And Obama represents nothing if not a cultural departure point. As is often the case with Obama, then, the old formulas may not apply. After all, while it's certainly not unusual for presidents to register much higher approval ratings than Congress, that divide has been particularly pronounced during Obama's presidency; in April, while approval for the Democratic Congress was registering in the Pew poll at 25 percent, its lowest point in the 24-year history of the survey, Obama's own approval rating remained close to 50 percent. What this disconnect means, perhaps, is that, while higher approval ratings for the president might still mean more votes for Democrats in the midterm elections, every point up or down could have less of an impact than it has in the past.
 Obama seems to exist on a separate plane from his party's other elected leaders, somehow deflecting much of the anti-Washington fervor that threatens to dispatch the rest of them. This is probably not only because voters see him as a more inspiring leader than Harry Reid or Nancy Pelosi, but also because they don't see him as a party leader at all, at least in the traditional sense. It's not simply how Obama came to govern that creates this impression. It's also a simple matter of who he is. Whatever you may think of Obama's policies or his politics, after all, his brand represents -- by the very nature of his age, his life story and the color of his skin -- a subversive force inside the governing establishment, and that's his advantage in this tea-party moment. Washington is, in fact, broken -- or at least most people believe it is, even if Obama stops saying so in his speeches. Voters may yet see Obama, in the years ahead, as disappointing or transformative or neither. But the one thing he will never really embody is the status quo.

HEADLINE: Two Weddings, a Divorce and 'Glee'

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
THOSE of us left off the guest list could only fantasize about Rush Limbaugh's nuptials last weekend. Now cruising into marriage No. 4 -- an impressive total for a guy not quite 60 -- Rush staged a lavish luau at the Breakers in Palm Beach. The revelers included what some might regard as the Rat Pack from hell -- Sean Hannity, Rudy Giuliani, James Carvilleand Clarence Thomas. The scriptural readings remain a mystery. But we did learn the identity of the pop deity anointed as the wedding singer. That would be Elton John, whose last, albeit second-class, wedding was a civil union with David Furnish in 2005.
 Why would America's right-wing radio king hire an openly gay entertainer to star at his wedding? And why would one of the world's foremost AIDS activists sing ''Can You Feel the Love Tonight'' for a gay-baiting provocateur who hastrivializedAIDS and speculated that same-sex marriage could lead people to marry dogs? Sir Elton's fee was reported to be a cool $1 million. Which goes to show that pop music and cash have the power to make even stranger bedfellows than politics. 
 June is America's month for weddings, and were we so inclined, we could bemoan Limbaugh, an idol to the family-values crowd, for marrying a woman barely half his age. Alternatively, we could lament Al and Tipper Gore's divorce, which has produced so many cries of shock you'd think they were the toy bride and groom atop a wedding cake rather than actual flesh-and-blood people capable of free will. But let's refrain from such moralistic hand-wringing. The old truth remains: We never know what goes on in anyone else's marriage, and it's none of our business. Here's a toast to happiness for the Gores and Limbaughs alike, wherever life takes them.
 But there is a shadow over marriage in America just the same. The Gores and Limbaughs are free to marry, for better or for worse, and free to enjoy all the rights (and make all the mistakes) that marriage entails. Gay and lesbian couples are still fighting for those rights. That's why the most significant marital event of June 2010 is the one taking place in San Francisco this Wednesday, when a Federal District Court judge is scheduled to hear the closing arguments in Perry v. Schwarzenegger, the landmark case challenging Proposition 8, California's same-sex marriage ban. A verdict will soon follow, setting off an appeals process that is likely to land in the Supreme Court, possibly by the 2011-12 term.
 When the former Bush v. Gore legal adversaries, Ted Olson and David Boies, teamed up to mount the assault on Prop 8, it was front-page news. But you may not know much about the trial that followed unless you made a point of finding out as it unfolded in January. Their efforts in this case, unlike the 2000 election battle, were denied the essential publicity oxygen of television. The judge had planned to post video of the proceedings daily on YouTube, but the Prop 8 forces won a 5-to-4 Supreme Court ruling to keep cameras out.
 Their stated reason for opposing a television record was fear that their witnesses might be harassed. But in the end the Prop 8 defenders mustered only two witnesses, just one of them a controversial culture warrior. That ''expert'' was David Blankenhorn, president of the so-called Institute for American Values. Blankenhorn holds no degree in such seemingly relevant fields as psychology, psychiatry or sociology. But his pretrial research did include reading a specious treatise by George Rekers, the antigay evangelist now notorious for his recent 10-day European trip with a young male companion procured from Rentboy.com. And Blankenhorn's testimony relies on the same sweeping generalization as Rekers -- that children raised by two biological parents are so advantaged that all alternatives should be shunned.
 What was the unqualified Blankenhorn doing at the Prop 8 trial? Like Rekers, who had a lucrative history of testifying for pay in legal cases attacking gay civil rights, he also profits from his propaganda. Public documents, including tax returns, reveal that Blankenhorn's institute, financed by such right-wing stalwarts as the Bradley and Scaife foundations, paid him $247,500 in base salary in 2008, the most recent year for which data is available, and another $70,000 to his wife. Not a bad payday for a self-professed arbiter of American marital values who under oath described his sole peer-reviewed academic paper (from the University of Warwick) as ''a study of two cabinetmakers' unions in 19th-century Britain.'' That the Prop 8 proponents employed him as their star witness suggests that no actual experts could be found (or rented) to match his disparagement of gay parents.
 You can't blame the Prop 8 advocates for wanting to keep Blankenhorn off camera. Boies demolished him during cross-examination. (Read the transcripts at equalrightsfoundation.org.) Another likely motive for opposing cameras at the trial was to shield viewers from the sympathetic gay plaintiffs -- ordinary tax-paying Americans whose families, including four children, were often in the courtroom.
 Gays are far from the only Americans still facing discrimination, but as Boies said when I interviewed him about the Prop 8 case last week, the ban on same-sex marriage ''is the last area in which the state is taking an active role in enforcing discrimination.'' And though some -- including Elton John, of all people -- have claimed that civil unions are tantamount to marriage and remedy marital inequality, that is a canard.
 Domestic partnerships and equal economic benefits aren't antidotes, Boies explains, because as long as gay Americans are denied the same right to marry as everyone else, they are branded as sub-citizens, less equal and less deserving than everyone else. That government-sanctioned stigma inevitably leaves them vulnerable to other slights and discrimination, both subtle and explicit. The damage is particularly acute for children, who must not only wonder why their parents are regarded as defective by the law but must also bear this scarlet letter of inferiority when among their peers.
 Boies doesn't dispute the consensus that the endgame in this case will most likely fall to Anthony Kennedy, the Supreme Court's reigning swing justice. Kennedy wrote the eloquent majority opinion in Lawrence v. Texas, the ruling that finally ended the criminalization of gay sex in 2003. But where he may come down in Perry v. Schwarzenegger is anybody's guess.
 What fuels Boies's hope for a just resolution is his faith in America itself. ''This country is a culture of equality,'' he says. ''We've got that baked into our collective American soul.'' He observes that attitudes continue to change fast on gay rights and that the approval rate for legalizing same-sex marriage -- up to 47 percent in a Washington Post poll in February -- is far higher than the approval was for interracial marriage (20 percent) even a year after the Supreme Court ruled it legal in 1967.
 It's not news that same-sex marriage is a settled issue for most young people. But the growing adult acceptance of unconventional family models can be found in the phenomenon of ''Glee,'' the prime-time hit on Rupert Murdoch's Fox, no less, that unexpectedly became this year's most watched new scripted series on television for the 18-to-49 demographic. ''Glee'' recounts the lives of students in a hypercompetitive show choir at an Ohio high school, and it's addictive for many reasons that have nothing to do with sexual politics. But what's exceptional is the way it mashes up different kinds of American families from week to week much as it mashes up musical genres ranging from vintage rock to hip-hop to Lady Gaga to show tunes in its performance sequences.
 The leading teenage characters in ''Glee'' have single parents (both widowed), absentee parents and, in one case, two gay dads. The teenagers suffer, struggle and occasionally triumph like any others, but along the way we see how families reconfigured by death, divorce and sexual orientation can be as loving, nurturing and, yes, as dysfunctional as any other. The landscape is recognizable as the country we actually live in. Even if family-values zealots do retain the ability to prevent America from watching the Prop 8 trial, we're lucky that the era when they could banish a show like ''Glee'' from network television seems to have passed.
 Dramatically enough, ''Glee'' generated an unexpected real-life story last weekend to match its fictional plots. The Times's Sunday wedding pages chronicled the Massachusetts same-sex marriage of Jane Lynch, the actress who steals the show as Sue Sylvester, the cheerleading coach who is the students' comic nemesis. It's a sunny article until you read that Lynch's spouse, a clinical psychologist named Lara Embry, had to fight a legal battle to gain visitation rights with her 10-year-old adoptive daughter from a previous relationship. That battle, which Dr. Embry ultimately won, was required by Florida's draconian laws against gay adoption -- laws that were enacted during Anita Bryant's homophobic crusades of the 1970s and more recently defended in court, for an expert witness fee of $120,000, by the Rev. Rekers of Rentboy.com renown.
 We've come a long way in a short time, but as the Embry case exemplifies, glee for gay people in America still does not match ''Glee'' on Fox. Until the law catches up to the culture, the collective American soul should find even June's wedding Champagne a bit flat.

HEADLINE: President Presses Congress for Aid to Cities and States

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama called Saturday for Congress to avert a planned 21 percent pay cut for doctors who see Medicare patients, saying the move was necessary to ensure the health of older Americans. 
 The so-called doc fix, which would cost taxpayers billions of dollars, has been stalled in the Senate. If lawmakers do not approve the spending, the cuts will take effect next week. 
 Mr. Obama used his weekly Internet address to warn that if Republicans block a vote on the issue, it would ''undoubtedly force some doctors to stop seeing Medicare patients altogether.''
 The pay cut is the result of a decade-old formula set up by Congress to slow the growth of Medicare, the government-run health insurance system for older Americans. Under the formula, reimbursement rates for Medicare would have been trimmed on a yearly basis. But every year since 2003, Congress has deferred the cuts, with backing from Democrats and Republicans.
 With Medicare costs -- and the federal deficit -- spiraling out of control, how to fix that formula became one of the most contentious questions of last year's health care debate. But the change did not get incorporated into the landmark health care overhaul that Mr. Obama signed into law. 
 The president acknowledged that putting the question off again by simply restoring doctors' pay for another year was not the answer.
 ''Now, I realize that simply kicking these cuts down the road another year is not a long-term solution to this problem,'' Mr. Obama said. ''For years, I have said that a system where doctors are left to wonder if they'll get fairly reimbursed makes absolutely no sense.''
 Democrats are proposing the fix as part of a package of legislation that would also extend tax breaks and unemployment benefits. Republicans say they are willing to support a fix, but they have their own proposal that, they argue, is more fiscally responsible.
 ''The question isn't whether to do a doc fix or not; the question is whether to add it to the debt or not,'' said Don Stewart, a spokesman for Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader.
 ''Republicans believe it should be paid for,'' Mr. Stewart said. ''The president and the Democrat leadership endorse a bill that would simply add it to an already crushing $13 trillion debt.''
 But with the deadline looming, Mr. Obama counters that lawmakers must act.
 ''I'm absolutely willing to take the difficult steps necessary to lower the cost of Medicare and put our budget on a more fiscally sustainable path,'' he said. ''But I'm not willing to do that by punishing hard-working physicians or the millions of Americans who count on Medicare.''

HEADLINE: The Year of the (Pro-Life) Woman

BYLINE: By RAMESH PONNURU. 
Ramesh Ponnuru is a senior editor at National Review.

 BODY:
Washington
 WHEN President George W. Bush signed the bill banning partial-birth abortion in 2003, supportive legislators gathered around for a photograph. All of them were men. Nancy Pelosi, then the House minority leader, called the image ''a slap in the face to women across America.'' 
 My fellow pro-lifers winced at the picture -- both because it offered Ms. Pelosi a political opportunity and because it reflected an enduring political weakness of our movement. American women are just as likely to be pro-life as American men, but few pro-life women have gone into politics. 
 The Gallup organization recently concluded that ''abortion polling since the mid-1970s finds few remarkable distinctions between men's and women's views on the legality of abortion.'' It has found that 48 percent of American women consider themselves pro-life, while 45 percent consider themselves pro-choice. 
 There are many millions of pro-life women, but there are only 13 in the House. The Senate has no pro-life women. Even Kay Bailey Hutchison, the Texas Republican who votes with pro-lifers on many issues, says she favors Roe v. Wade. All of the women who have served on the Supreme Court have supported Roe, too. 
 Pro-life women have not even found representation among Republican first ladies, all of whom in the post-Roe era have been pro-choice. One reason that Sarah Palin's nomination for vice president in 2008 was so immediately polarizing is that she instantly became the most prominent pro-life woman American politics has ever produced.
 Sarah Palin is about to get some company. Two pro-life women won Republican nominations for the Senate this week. A Tea Party favorite, Sharron Angle, and the former Hewlett-Packard chief executive Carly Fiorina are running for the Senate from Nevada and California, respectively. 
 A third pro-life woman, Susana Martinez, became the party's nominee for governor of New Mexico, and a fourth, Nikki Haley, a South Carolina state legislator, is expected to be a gubernatorial nominee in her state. If they win their primaries, Kelly Ayotte, the former attorney general of New Hampshire, and Jane Norton, the former lieutenant governor of Colorado, will also be pro-life Senate candidates in November.
 None of these candidates is a single-issue pro-lifer. But these women have not been shy about discussing the issue, either. Neither Ms. Fiorina nor Ms. Haley would have been likely to get Ms. Palin's endorsement -- valuable in a Republican primary -- without firmly opposing abortion. Likewise, Ms. Angle would not have been able to unite populist conservatives and beat the party establishment's candidate had she been pro-choice.
 The number of pro-life women running for office has increased, perhaps paradoxically, because of the social changes of the last few decades. The first generation of women to become active in politics strongly identified as feminist and considered abortion rights central to their feminism. Pro-life women were more likely to be full-time homemakers. Their invisibility on the public stage contributed to an impression that the vast majority of women were pro-choice.
 These days socially conservative women are likely to have careers, too. The growing number of Americans who consider themselves pro-life suggests that fewer people, of either sex, consider access to abortion to be crucial to women's economic success. The pro-life stance generally wins Republicans votes in general elections, because pro-lifers are more likely to vote on the issue than pro-choicers are. 
 That advantage is likely to be more pronounced for pro-life women running for office. Kellyanne Conway, a Republican pollster, says that her surveys have found that voters respond more positively to the pro-life message when it comes from women. Pro-life women won't be suspected, or credibly accused, of opposing abortion because they want to keep women in their place; they can therefore talk about the issue less defensively than male pro-lifers sometimes do. 
 Pro-life women can also soften the message: Ms. Fiorina has said, ''I myself was not able to have children of my own, and so I know what a precious gift life is.'' It's hard to imagine a male politician making that comment. These women will make it easier for pro-lifers to discuss the issue in the terms we want to discuss it: as a plea for justice for a vulnerable group. 
 Some of these pro-life women are bound to win their elections, and that will surely change the tenor of the national conversation about abortion. For instance, previous abortion debates in the Senate have pitted Ms. Boxer against Rick Santorum, the former senator from Pennsylvania. Next time the gender divide won't be so stark.
 Political journalists called 1992 ''the year of the woman'' because so many female candidates won Senate seats that year -- including Barbara Boxer, who was elevated from the House. All those women supported abortion rights. ''We have been waiting for our 1992,'' says Marjorie Dannenfelser, the president of the Susan B. Anthony List, which encourages pro-life women to run for Congress. Her wait is coming to an end.

HEADLINE: For Turkey, Siding With Iran Is a Matter Of Realpolitik

BYLINE: By SABRINA TAVERNISE

 BODY:
ISTANBUL -- Viewed from Washington, Turkey and Iran are strange bedfellows. One is a NATO member with a Constitution that mandates secularism, and the other, an Islamic republic whose nuclear program has been one of the most vexing foreign policy problems for the United States in recent years. 
 So why have the two countries been locked in a clumsy embrace, with Turkey openly defying the United States last week by voting against imposing new sanctions on Iran?
 For the United States, the vote was a slap by a close ally that has prompted soul searching about Turkey. In London on Wednesday, Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates mused that Turkey was ''moving eastward,'' a shift he attributed to the European Union's tepid response to Turkey's application to join it.
 That is a narrative that is gaining ground: Turkey, the East-West bridge, sided with the East because it had lost its way on its path to becoming more like the West. But many here do not see it that way. Turkey is not lost, they say, but simply disagrees with the United States over how to approach the problems in the Middle East. The Obama administration chooses sanctions, while Turkey believes cooperation has more of a chance of stopping Iran from building a bomb. To that end, it has actively negotiated with Tehran over its nuclear program. 
 ''I would be appalled if Turkey cut itself off from the West and aligned with the Islamic world, but that's not what's happening,'' said Halil Berktay, a historian at Sabanci University. ''Turkey is saying, 'You've been talking about building bridges. This is the way to build them.' '' 
 At the heart of the current friction is a fundamental disagreement over Iran and its intent. For the United States, Iran is a rogue state intent on building a bomb and crazy enough to use it. Turkey agrees that Iran is trying to develop the technology that would let it quickly build a weapon if it chose, but says Iran's leaders may be satisfied stopping at that. ''We believe that once we normalize relations with Iran, and it has relationships with other actors, it won't go for the bomb,'' said a Turkish official who works closely with Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
 Besides, Turkish officials say, previous sets of sanctions have not worked with Iran, which continues to insist that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes. 
 Part of Turkey's motivation in reaching out to Iran is based in realpolitik. Iran is Turkey's neighbor and also supplies the country with a fifth of its natural gas.
 The approach is also part of a broader policy of economic and political integration in the region that Turkey, under Mr. Erdogan, has pursued for nearly a decade. Iranians can travel to Turkey without a visa, as can Syrians, Iraqis, Russians and Georgians. More than a million Iranians travel to Turkey on vacation every year. A Turkish company built Tehran's main airport.
 The nuclear talks were part of that effort. They culminated in May in what Turkey, and its partner Brazil, said was a commitment by Iran to swap a portion of its low-enriched uranium with other countries. Iran would ship out part of its stockpile in exchange for a form of uranium less likely to be used for weapons.
 But American officials went ahead with sanctions anyway, saying the amount to be swapped under the agreement was no longer enough to stop Iran from making a bomb. 
 Months ago Iran had negotiated a similar deal with the West, including the United States, but then backed away. At the time Iran had a smaller stockpile, and swapping material then would have deprived the country of enough fuel for a bomb for about a year.
 ''The prevailing sentiment in Washington is that the agreement is just another Iranian ploy and that Ankara has played into Tehran's hands,'' said Steven Cook, an expert at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington. 
 A Western diplomat added, ''The general feeling in Washington is that the Iranians really aren't going to negotiate away their nuclear program.'' 
 Turkey says it fears a nuclear-armed Iran, because it would upset the balance of power between the two countries, but it also worries that the Obama administration's focus on sanctions -- reminiscent of President George W. Bush's rush to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, some here say -- will lead to war. 
 ''The Western countries do things and Turkey pays the bill,'' said Sedat Laciner, director of the International Strategic Research Organization in Ankara. ''We don't want another Iraq.''
 The Turkish official, meanwhile, explained the country's rationale for treating Iran with respect. ''We are saying, make them feel like they have something real to lose by going for a bomb,'' said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ''Will sanctions change Iranian behavior? No. Will it stop them from further enriching uranium? It will not.''
 It is a risky calculation, but one that Hooman Majd, an Iranian-American writer, says the Turks are in the best position to make. Unlike Americans, Turks travel to Iran frequently and speak a language similar to the Azeri dialect spoken in Iran's north.
 ''Iran doesn't want to be North Korea,'' Mr. Majd said. ''It would rather be as sophisticated, powerful and respected as Turkey. Building weapons, even if they could, does not get them there. Erdogan knows that.''
 The United States expressed disappointment at Turkey's vote against sanctions last week, saying it would undermine the Obama administration's ability to support Turkey. But Turkey's calculation was pragmatic, some officials said. Its ''no'' vote did not stop the resolution, while allowing Turkish officials to work the Arab street. 
 Top leaders of Mr. Erdogan's party believe that only a Turkey that is independent from the United States will be an asset for Washington in the long run. America has a credibility problem in the Muslim world after the Bush administration's wars, and is also seen by many as having a double standard with Israel.
 ''In their own minds, they're smarter than us,'' said an American expert who helps make policy for the region. ''They see us as wanting crass cheerleading. But they're saying, 'Look, we're going to be more useful to you.' '' 
 But that can be very uncomfortable for the United States, for example when Mr. Erdogan's political party hosted Khaled Meshal, the Hamas leader, in Turkey in 2006.
 The American expert argued that the regional rise of Turkey was not to be feared. It counters the influence of Iran in the Middle East, and as a NATO ally with a powerful economy, a vibrant democracy and relations with Israel, has something to teach the Muslim world, and it cannot play that role by being an American instrument. 
 Still, he said that ''the Turks are finding that the vision that they have is very good on paper, but striking the balance of being a close American ally and popular on the Arab street is awfully difficult to achieve.''

HEADLINE: The Ahab Parallax

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY

 BODY:
A specially outfitted ship ventures into deep ocean waters in search of oil, increasingly difficult to find. Lines of authority aboard the ship become tangled. Ambition outstrips ability. The unpredictable forces of nature rear up, and death and destruction follow in their wake. ''Some fell flat on their faces,'' an eyewitness reported of the stricken crew. ''Through the breach, they heard the waters pour.''
 The words could well have been spoken by a survivor of the doomed oil rig Deepwater Horizon, which exploded in the Gulf of Mexico in April, killing 11 men and leading to the largest oil spill in United States history. But they come instead, of course, from that wordy, wayward Manhattanite we know as Ishmael, whose own doomed vessel, the whaler Pequod, sailed only through the pages of ''Moby-Dick.'' 
 In the weeks since the rig explosion, parallels between that disaster and the proto-Modernist one imagined by Melville more than a century and a half ago have sometimes been striking -- and painfully illuminating as the spill becomes a daily reminder of the limitations, even now, of man's ability to harness nature for his needs. The novel has served over the years as a remarkably resilient metaphor for everything from atomic power to the invasion of Iraq to the decline of the white race (this from D. H. Lawrence, who helped revive Melville's reputation). Now, 50 miles off the Louisiana coast, its themes of hubris, destructiveness and relentless pursuit are as telling as ever.
 The British petroleum giant BP, which leased the Deepwater Horizon to drill the well, has naturally been cast in the Ahab role, most recently on one of Al Jazeera's blogs by Nick Spicer, who compared the whaler's maniacal mission to the dangers of greed, ''not just to a man such as Captain Ahab, but to all his crew and to the whole society that supports their round-the-world quest for oil.''
 Andrew Delbanco, the director of Columbia University's American studies program and the author of ''Melville: His World and Work,'' said, ''It's irresistible to make the analogy between the relentless hunt for whale oil in Melville's day and for petroleum in ours.'' Melville's story ''is certainly, among many other things, a cautionary tale about the terrible cost of exploiting nature for human wants,'' he said. ''It's a story about self-destruction visited upon the destroyer -- and the apocalyptic vision at the end seems eerily pertinent to today.''
 Whaling was the petroleum industry of its day in the 18th and 19th centuries, with hundreds of ships plying the oceans in search of the oil that could be rendered from the world's largest mammals. The 40-ton bodies of sperm whales could yield dozens of barrels, some derived from blubber and the rest, the most precious kind, spermaceti, from the whale's head. The oil burned in millions of lamps, served as a machine lubricant and was processed into candles distinguished by their clear, bright flame, with little smoke or odor. In addition, whalebones could be used to stiffen corsets, skin could be cured for leather, and ambergris, the aromatic digestive substance, could be incorporated into perfumes. New England ports, the Houstons of their era, and fortunes were built with whale oil money.
 At one point, the United States exported a million gallons a year to Europe, according to Philip Hoare, author of ''The Whale: In Search of the Giants of the Sea,'' an obsessive disquisition on all matters cetacean, published in March. ''The whaler was a kind of pirate-miner -- an excavator of oceanic oil, stoking the furnace of the Industrial Revolution as much as any man digging coal out of the earth,'' Mr. Hoare writes, adding the observation of the English statesman Edmund Burke to Parliament in 1775 that there was ''no sea but what is vexed by'' New England harpoons. While other kinds of ships sat nearly dark on the waters when the sun went down, a whaler could look like a floating Chinese lantern, the sailors luxuriating in the light produced by the fuel they carried. ''He makes his berth an Aladdin's lamp, and lays him down in it,'' Melville wrote, rhapsodizing about an oil ''as sweet as early-grass butter in April.''
 But much like the modern petroleum industry -- which began in the late 1850s, making it only slightly younger than Melville's novel -- whaling quickly came up against the limits of its resources. Hunting grounds near North America were wiped out by the early 19th century. And the lengths to which ships had to go to continue to find them led to the event that inspired ''Moby-Dick,'' the sinking in 1820 of the whaling ship Essex, which was rammed by a sperm whale in the South Pacific, more than 10,000 miles from home.
 The Essex had headed there to hunt at a whale-rich site discovered only a year earlier. It was called the Offshore Ground, a name suggestive of the highly productive oil site known as Mississippi Canyon, where the Deepwater Horizon was at work when it exploded. Underwater fields like it have made the Gulf of Mexico into the fastest-growing source of oil in the United States, accounting for a third of domestic supplies.
 But in the same way whalers had to sail farther and farther for their prey, oil companies are drilling deeper and deeper to tap the gulf's oil, to levels made possible only by the most advanced technology, operating near its limits. The Coast Guard has warned that this technology has outpaced not only government oversight but -- as events have shown -- the means of correcting catastrophic failures. An admonition from Nietzsche that Mr. Hoare cites in reference to ''Moby-Dick'' seems just as pertinent to the spill: ''And if thou gaze long into an abyss, the abyss will also gaze into thee.''
 Mr. Delbanco cautions, however, against the tendency to read environmentalist moralizing into ''Moby-Dick,'' as often happens when it is applied to contemporary disasters. Melville did, memorably, wonder whether the whale ''must not at last be exterminated from the waters, and the last whale, like the last man, smoke his last pipe.'' But one gets the sense that he would have considered the loss a greater one to literature than to the ecosystem. ''Even as he recoiled from their blindness and brutality,'' Mr. Delbanco said, ''Melville celebrated the heroism of the hunters who would stop at nothing to get what human civilization demanded.''
 And, indeed, the analogies between the whale and petroleum industries have often been used by conservative economists as an argument against regulation. During the energy crisis of the 1970s, Phil Gramm, later to be a Republican United States senator but then an economics professor at Texas A&M University, made a name for himself by writing about the demise of the whale oil industry, done in by the supply shortage and the interruption of the Civil War, leading to the first energy crisis. The rising price of whale oil, he wrote, created an incentive to find an alternative. It arrived in 1859 when Edwin Drake drilled America's first oil well, in Pennsylvania, and a process to make kerosene from it was discovered. The unfettered market followed its natural course toward the new fuel, and the crisis ended.
 Of course, the spill has now rewritten the script for the debate about how the oil industry should be able to operate and scrambled the political calculus behind President Obama's plans, announced in March, to open vast new areas to offshore drilling so as to reduce dependence on imports and win backing for climate legislation. The spill, looming as the worst environmental disaster in the country's history, might in itself be incentive to push the United States more quickly toward new energy sources in the way it once turned to petroleum.
 But maybe not. When the leak is finally stanched and the cleanup begins to fade from the news, one wonders whether Melville won't be there again in his long whiskers and topcoat, offering up his gloomy wisdom.
 One of the great underlying themes of ''Moby-Dick,'' Mr. Delbanco observed, ''is that people ashore don't want to know about the ugly things that go on at sea.''
 ''We want our comforts but we don't want to know too much about where they come from or what makes them possible.'' He added: ''The oil spill in the gulf is a horror, but how many Americans are ready to pay more for oil or for making the public investment required to develop alternative energy? I suspect it's a question that Melville would be asking of us now.''

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Sunday about ''Moby-Dick'' as a metaphor for the quest for petroleum and the recent spill misstated a word in an excerpt from Philip Hoare's ''The Whale: In Search of the Giants of the Sea.'' Mr. Hoare wrote, ''The whaler was a kind of pirate-miner -- an excavator of oceanic oil, stoking the furnace of the Industrial Revolution as much as any man digging coal out of the earth.'' He did not write ''pirate-minter.''

NEOCONSERVATISM
 The Biography of a Movement
 By Justin Vaisse
 Translated by Arthur Goldhammer.366 pp. The Belknap Press/ Harvard University Press. $35
 Probably no group of intellectuals has had a greater impact on American politics over the last four decades than the neoconservatives. The Rolling Stones even sang a song about them. Yet who or what exactly is a neoconservative? Over the years the meaning of the word has changed. Initially it referred to a coterie of liberals and leftists, absorbed in domestic policy issues, who raised questions about the efficacy of Lyndon Johnson's Great Society programs in the mid-1960s. Today, neoconservatives seem restricted for the most part to the Republican Party and are advocates of a muscular foreign policy. Irving Kristol, who once described himself as a liberal ''mugged by reality,'' was one kind of neoconservative. His son, William, a lifelong Republican, is an entirely different kind. 
 This definitional question, and in particular neoconservatism's extraordinary transformation, is the principal subject of ''Neoconservatism: The Biography of a Movement,'' by Justin Vaisse, a French expert on American foreign policy who is currently a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. It is essential reading for anyone wishing to understand the contours of our recent political past. Vaisse is a historian of ideas. ''Neoconservatism'' demonstrates, among other things, that ideas really do make a difference in our lives.
 Vaisse defines neoconservatism by disassembling it. He sees three ''ages'' to the movement. The first began in the mid-1960s with intellectuals like Irving Kristol, Daniel Bell, Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Nathan Glazer gathering around Kristol and Bell's new magazine, The Public Interest, and also around Commentary, under its editor Norman Podhoretz. At the time, all of these writers were sympathetic in principle to an activist government, especially when it came to the economy, but questioned the expectations of Great Society planners of antipoverty and related social programs -- or, in Saul Bellow's phrase, the Good Intentions Paving Company. Challenging what they saw as liberal overreaching and wishful thinking with hard, often crushing, empirical facts, these early neoconservatives were, in a sense, the skeptical conscience of liberalism.
 But skepticism about the effectiveness of particular programs soon mutated into broader disenchantment with almost every kind of government intervention and into the conviction that the free market alone offered acceptable solutions to social problems. As neoconservative pragmatism calcified into laissez-faire dogma, some of its godfathers defected. Daniel Bell, a self-described ''right-wing social democrat,'' for one; Moynihan, who, Vaisse writes, ''contended that he was the modern incarnation of a Wilsonian Progressive,'' for another. By the time President Ronald Reagan proclaimed ''government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem,'' neoconservatism was a spent force in domestic policy, hardly distinguishable from the libertarianism of the American Enterprise Institute.
 In the second and third ages, as Vaisse describes them, neoconservatives turned their attention to foreign policy. This wasn't surprising. The original neoconservatives were devout anti-Communists for whom opposition to Stalinism and the Soviet Union was as much a left-wing as a right-wing position. This is why the neoconservatives of the second age reacted against what Vaisse calls ''the conquest of the Democratic Party by the forces of the New Left,'' begun in 1968 and completed in 1972, when George McGovern won the presidential nomination. The McGovernites, strenuously opposed to the Vietnam War and distrustful of American power, struck more hawkish Democrats as naive about Communism, even isolationist. The neocons rallied behind Henry Jackson, known as Scoop, a Democratic senator from Washington who, though a supporter of the Great Society's domestic programs, was the most unrepentant of cold warriors. He nurtured the careers of many young men later known as the toughest of the tough-minded -- Richard Perle, Paul Wolfowitz, Elliott Abrams and Douglas Feith.
 Second-age neoconservatives formed the Coalition for a Democratic Majority, an organization established for the explicit purpose of winning back the Democratic Party from the McGovernites. Vaisse skillfully delineates the maneuvers of the C.D.M. -- including the recruitment of party regulars, labor leaders and disenchanted leftists -- along with those of its successor organization, the nonpartisan but intensely hawkish Committee on the Present Danger. (Vaisse also notes that the C.D.M. gave rise to another organization, the Democratic Leadership Council, which in turn gave rise to Bill Clinton.) After Jackson, who had all the charisma of a Northwestern spruce, failed to win the 1976 presidential nomination, many members of the C.D.M. began looking elsewhere.
 Vaisse's third age, which runs from the Reagan presidency to the present, includes not only neoconservative refugees from the Democratic Party but also a new generation, like the younger Kristol, who came of age within the Republican Party. And Vaisse's story of this period is much like his earlier story: the deterioration of a perspective grounded in the reality of the cold war and the threat posed by the Soviet Union into a rigidly hawkish ideology, along with the peeling off of prominent defectors, like Francis Fukuyama.
 Vaisse's narrative is especially critical of the third-age neoconservatives, whom he depicts as arrogant, alarmist and intellectually lazy. The people so described might point out that these are hardly disinterested judgments since they come from a fellow at the Brookings Institution, which Vaisse acknowledges is a rival to the American Enterprise Institute, home of many neoconservatives. And it is true that Vaisse's opinions sometimes get the better of him. He says, for example, that the invasion of Iraq under the second Bush ''did nothing'' to forestall nuclear proliferation, though it is not at all obvious that the world would be a safer place at the moment if Saddam Hussein were still in a position to restart his nuclear program and engage in an arms race with the mullahs of Iran. Generally, however, Vaisse draws on the facts to support his argument that neoconservatism has become doctrinaire and tiresomely predictable.
 There seems to be no war neoconservatives won't eagerly fight, no arms program they won't happily support. Reagan wasn't combative enough for them, and even as the Soviet Union was collapsing, neocons were warning of a growing Russian menace. Before 9/11 redirected their attention to the Middle East, they were urging a confrontation with China. They remain suspicious of diplomacy, with its penchant for negotiation, compromise and the half loaf -- who needs a State Department? ''For neoconservatives,'' Vaisse writes, ''there was no threat that could not be handled with a larger military budget, more patriotism and a few victorious foreign interventions.'' They have learned the lesson of Munich, perhaps, but not of the Cuban missile crisis. Devastatingly, Vaisse points out that ''neoconservatives have not allowed a year to go by since 1972 without calling for an increase in the defense budget.''
 The central question about neoconservatism these days is whether the term retains any content at all. When knowledgeable journalists can refer to that arch-paleoconservative, William F. Buckley Jr., as a neoconservative, it may be time to consign the label to history. Vaisse struggles to distinguish the neoconservatives of the third age from what some have called ''assertive nationalists'' like Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld, but he seems to be arguing for a distinction without a difference. Today, individuals identified as neoconservatives can be heard calling for the bombing of Iran, for expanding NATO into Ukraine and Georgia, and for unquestioning fealty to Israeli hard-liners. There is nothing particularly ''neoconservative'' about these positions. They are simply the views of the most unwaveringly hawkish of America's hawks.

HEADLINE: Criticism Flowing Like Oil, but Obama's Rating Is Steady

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
Oil has gushed into the Gulf of Mexico for eight weeks now - and sent a bipartisan wave of criticism crashing into the White House.
 Allies and adversaries have accused President Obama of reacting too slowly, deferring too much to BP, displaying too little emotion and demonstrating incompetent management. Fans of historical analogy compare his performance to ineffectual responses by President Jimmy Carter during the Iran hostage crisis, and President George W. Bush during Hurricane Katrina.
 In other words, the crisis in the gulf has become a first-class political crisis, too. 
 Right?
 Maybe not - or at least, not so far.
 Polls show that American voters give Mr. Obama the same mixed evaluation as before the spill. They like him personally but have reservations about his policies. Roughly half approve of his performance in the Oval Office, about where the president has remained since last fall, after his initial honeymoon with Americans faded.
 ''It's hard to make the case that the BP oil spill has a substantial impact on Obama's job approval,'' said Bill McInturff, a Republican pollster.
 Charles Franklin, an analyst for pollster.com, has tried to make it. Mr. Franklin examined polls that run ''hot'' for Mr. Obama, like the Washington Post/ABC News survey that recently measured a 52 percent job approval rating.
 He parsed polls that run colder, like Rasmussen Reports, whose automated phone survey recorded 47 percent approval over the weekend. Neither has moved significantly since the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded on April 20.
 Gallup's daily ''tracking'' has shown a slight decline. But after examining the surveys used in the tracking, and finding scant movement in other polls, Mr. Franklin isn't convinced of genuine deterioration beyond routine survey-to-survey ''noise.''
 ''I see current approval about in line with the fluctuations we've seen all year for each pollster,'' said Mr. Franklin, a political scientist at the University of Wisconsin. ''Little evidence of real change.''
 Keeping Close Tabs
 Presidential job approval is the most-watched statistic in American politics, a proxy for the chief executive's power to persuade lawmakers, capacity to win re-election and ability to help or hurt in midterm elections.
 It rarely moves rapidly. Because Americans know so much about presidents already, new information must be extraordinarily powerful to change impressions.
 National security crises can do it when the public rallies around the president. After 9/11, Mr. Bush's approval rating quickly jumped to the 80s from the 50s.
 Political fiascos can have the opposite effect, if not as dramatically. By mid-2005, setbacks in Iraq, a star-crossed effort to overhaul Social Security and the right-to-die controversy involving Terri Schiavo were sapping Mr. Bush's strength.
 When Hurricane Katrina hit, Mr. Franklin calculated, Mr. Bush's approval rating was already dropping by one percentage point a month. The rate of decline doubled in the wake of Katrina's televised images of human suffering.
 Fortunately for Mr. Obama, the BP spill hasn't produced comparable images. Also shielding him is the presence of BP, a corporate giant in an unpopular industry, as a lightning rod.
 A third factor is the administration's effort to publicize its attempts to respond and hold BP accountable. That effort will include another trip to the gulf on Monday and a presidential address on Tuesday night.
 ''His standing with the American people is not being negatively affected,'' said Joel Benenson, a pollster for Mr. Obama, because ''they overwhelmingly see the president making this his top priority.''Subtler Damage?
 Mr. Obama may be sustaining damage in subtler ways. Gallup's slight decline could prove the leading edge of a trend that shows up later in other surveys.
 The spill could also increase White House vulnerability to future setbacks. Mr. McInturff noted that Katrina, by eroding Mr. Bush's reputation for competence, had deeper long-term ramifications for his presidency than were apparent in the fall of 2005.
 Moreover, attention to the spill has cost the administration opportunities to communicate on what Democrats want to be their 2010 centerpiece: recovery from the Great Recession.
 The spill ''adds to the burdens he carries,'' said Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew Research Center. ''But none of it is as central to judgments about him as the economy and unemployment.''
 Indeed, the stickiness of Mr. Obama's standing cuts both ways. If BP has not eroded it, the administration's signal achievement - passage of health care legislation - has not enhanced it much, either, as joblessness hovers near 10 percent.
 And one thing Democratic strategists agree on: they need Mr. Obama's approval rating to move higher to ease their Election Day pain.
 Earlier this month, as Mr. Obama visited the gulf, the Labor Department reported that just 41,000 new private sector jobs had been created in May, down from more than 200,000 in April. That flow rate is likely to prove most critical to the president and his party this fall.
 This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Traditional Jobs, Modern Mind-Sets

BYLINE: By MICHAEL A. COSTONIS and ROB SALKOWITZ. 
Michael A. Costonis is executive director of Accenture's insurance practice in North America. Rob Salkowitz is the author of ''Young World Rising.''

 BODY:
SINCE 2008, the global economy has been reeling from the one-two punch of a major financial crisis and a sharp worldwide recession. Unemployment remains high, and employers are extremely cautious about committing to new hires.
This environment masks a major shift in the global work force, one that threatens the viability of many established industries. To put it bluntly, the Western world is aging -- quickly -- and the skills of this aging work force are not being passed along to a new generation of workers. The number of skilled jobs is already starting to overtake the number of qualified people available to fill them.
This is especially true in labor-intensive, nonglamorous industries like insurance. By some estimates, more than 50 percent of life insurance agents in the United States are older than 45, and almost 70 percent of claims adjusters are at least 45. 
The insurance industry is not particularly attractive to the so-called ''millennials'' -- people who turned 21 in 2000 or later. And many other industries, including transportation, utilities and manufacturing, face a similar problem.
Beyond the fact that the industries themselves may lack appeal as career options, it is easy for senior managers -- often people in their 50s and 60s who built their careers in a pre-Internet world -- to misunderstand what the millennials want.
Younger workers seek different rewards and different work environments. And companies, if they want to thrive in the long term, need to adapt their cultures accordingly.
Like many older industries, insurance uses an apprentice structure, with a long learning curve and slow promotions for adjusters and underwriters. This does not fit the millennial expectation of rapid feedback, flat organizational structure and dynamic career development.
Young workers grew up in a digital culture distinguished by near-immediate sharing of information. They tend to be collaborative and team-oriented, even when they aren't technology experts. They grew up multitasking and don't see the sharp delineations between ''work'' and ''leisure'' that previous generations did. Millennials often prize freedom, innovation and speed over security and stability. They seek flexibility in work schedules and work locations.
Most of all, young workers take access to technology for granted -- as a way to get information, keep track of friends, schedule activities and do their work. And, of course, this access has now gone mobile, via wireless connections and smartphones.
Newer technology also creates a more networked and less hierarchical workplace. Work is distributed across more people in more places, with virtual teams communicating more or less instantly.
Keep in mind, too, that younger workers grew up with technology as consumers, not as employees. They encountered technologies like instant-messaging, blogging, social networks, mashups and RSS feeds long before they saw them at work.
Only a few years ago, most of the technology used in business was developed by commercial software makers, and corporate I.T. departments took responsibility for development and training. ''Ordinary'' people didn't use Lotus Notes or PeopleSoft outside the office.
It's not surprising, then, that younger people coming to a corporate environment may not find the level of connectedness to which they are accustomed.
Managers in ''old fashioned'' industries like insurance walk a fine line. They must balance concerns about security, productivity and privacy against the technological needs of the younger work force.
The age gap in technology cuts both ways. The transparent and kaleidoscopic qualities of the modern information environment can be profoundly unsettling to mature workers comfortable with a more linear work style. All organizations must balance the needs and expectations of these contrasting types of workers.
INSURANCE and other traditional industries may be a less-than-ideal fit for American-born millennials, but globally, there are nearly 3.5 billion people under 30, and gaining access to them via technology is becoming easier every day. The future of insurance resides in this young world of new talent.
The challenge is to find ways to bridge the gap so employers can tap into the benefits of the next-generation work force while maintaining the cultural continuity and valuable experience that older workers contribute.
An important first step is for managers to encourage communication between their information technology and human resources departments. Working together, they need to come up with cohesive approaches for hiring an enthusiastic, technology-savvy younger generation.

HEADLINE: For a Mogul, Money and Magic Touch Have Limits

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH LESLY STEVENS; estevens@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
Only a certain type of person would even want to buy a house named Le Petit Trianon. 
 Built more than a century ago as a replica of Marie Antoinette's retreat at Versailles, the house had been uninhabited, long in search of a buyer. Almost comically formal, with massive marble pillars, sweeping staircases and a wall of stained-glass windows, it looks more like the Federal Reserve than a family home.
But for Halsey M. Minor, the founder of CNet and a star of the first Internet boom, the property fit the bill. Coming off a divorce and a brief stint as a bachelor-about-town based in Bel Air, Mr. Minor, who had a new wife, was in need of a San Francisco home.
 He bought Le Petit Trianon in 2007 for about $22 million, and hired Michael S. Smith -- a celebrity decorator who would go on to make over the White House for the Obamas -- to redo it for $15 million. It was a very public statement by Mr. Minor in the city where he had made his fortune. 
 Today, though, Le Petit Trianon looks forlorn and neglected, half-covered with long-dead ivy, its grounds unkempt. Earlier this spring, when the still-unrenovated house was temporarily in foreclosure, teenage boys spent a sunny afternoon using the sweeping marble staircases as perhaps the world's most expensive skateboarding ramp. 
 The state of Le Petit Trianon is a perfect metaphor for the troubles of Mr. Minor. CNet and his early investment in Salesforce.com earned him fame as a dot-com wunderkind and a fortune estimated at several hundred million dollars. But an epic three-year spending spree left him with a pile of debts and lawsuits -- and a lesson in what can happen when a young business star spends to live at a level that his income may no longer support.
 ''He thought he was a billionaire, spending far more than he had,'' said one business associate who has known him for years but feared the consequences of alienating the high-profile Mr. Minor. ''But he really was a multimillionaire, always thinking 'I'm going to make the big score.' ''
 Mr. Minor said his trouble started in the fall of 2008, on the day Merrill Lynch & Company, in its own financial panic, froze his accounts and placed liens on much of his property to ensure repayment of a $25 million loan. ''Merrill took away all my liquidity,'' he said in an interview on Friday. ''I couldn't sell anything.'' 
 Mr. Minor said he had assets worth $207 million in 2008, and they are worth $125 million now. ''My death has been prematurely reported,'' he said.
 At the time his accounts were frozen, Mr. Minor was in the midst of a prodigious spending spree: $20 million for a Bel Air house; $22 million for Le Petit Trianon; $7 million for a failed luxury-hotel project in Charlottesville, Va., Mr. Minor's hometown; $25 million in bids for art at Sotheby's and Christie's; $15.3 million for a Virginia plantation; $6.3 million for two thoroughbred racehorses; a $3 million deposit on a now-canceled order for a top-of-the-line Gulfstream jet. 
 The fallout of Mr. Minor's liquidity crisis has been brutal. In April, the State of California pilloried Mr. Minor and his second wife, Shannon, as the state's top income-tax debtors, owing $13.1 million. He is trying to sell the Bel Air house for less than $9 million. He originally paid $20 million for it. 
 Mr. Minor is delinquent by nearly $300,000 on the property's taxes. He said that over the years he has made ''massive'' tax payments and other contributions to California and that he intends to resolve all these issues. 
 ''I've been straight up with the I.R.S., told them what I owed them,'' Mr. Minor said.
 In January, he almost lost his longtime Charlottesville farm to foreclosure. He was forced to sell dozens of pieces of artwork in May and furniture in June at the Phillips de Pury & Company auction house to satisfy a judgment that arose from the Merrill loan. 
 A lawsuit stemming from Mr. Minor's failure to pay $13 million he owed Sotheby's led to a $6.6 million judgment in the spring. Last week, the New York federal judge overseeing the case ordered him to surrender by mid-June a long list of his remaining assets. 
 Sotheby's said it had put Mr. Minor on a ''no-bid'' list and asked the judge in a court filing to force him to surrender pets worth more than $50 and any food his family would not be able to consume in the next 60 days. 
 ''We live in a culture where people are worth less than corporations,'' he said, adding that his lawsuit against Merrill Lynch, scheduled to begin in January in Los Angeles, will vindicate him.
 Yet Mr. Minor still swaggers like a billionaire. Appearing before a San Francisco jury last month for a case in which he and Christie's are suing each other, he was dressed in alpha-mogul casual -- a polo sweater, slacks and loafers, while all those working mightily either to bring him down or prop him up wore suits. 
 Mr. Minor's own lawyer described him to the jury as ''rude'' and ''unlikable,'' but the case was a rare recent victory for Mr. Minor, who was awarded $8.6 million after he had sued Christie's over seven Richard Prince artworks that the auction house had held in an effort to pressure him to pay $12 million owed for newly bought art. The jury also found that Mr. Minor owed Christie's about $1.3 million to compensate it for the lower price that subsequent buyers were willing to pay. 
 Mr. Minor is still engaged in the technology business via Minor Ventures, a technology investment firm whose biggest success has been Google's 2007 acquisition of Grand Central, a voice-technology company, for about $65 million. Minor Ventures had invested $4 million in the start-up company in late 2005, and held a minority stake in it, said Craig Walker, Grand Central's chief executive. 
 Though his involvement with Mr. Minor as a shareholder ended before Mr. Minor's legal and financial troubles began in earnest, Mr. Walker said that the experience was a positive one.
 ''His style was certainly not offensive to me,'' Mr. Walker said. ''He was always superpositive. I actually enjoyed it, and he was usually right.''
 Mr. Minor's forays into glamour businesses, though, have not ended well. Lee Danielson, a real-estate developer who teamed with him on the failed Charlottesville hotel deal, said: ''Halsey wants the best of everything. Everything has to be bigger than what anyone else has.''
 Mr. Danielson added that Mr. Minor ''overpays and doesn't do his due diligence.'' He and Mr. Minor are now battling in court over the failed deal.
 Mr. Danielson's recounting of Mr. Minor's entree into the expensive world of thoroughbred racing sheds light on Mr. Minor's decision making.
 ''I was on his plane,'' Mr. Danielson said, ''and he told me: 'I just bought a horse that is going to win the Kentucky Derby. He's just like Seabiscuit. I looked into his eyes and can just tell he is a winner.' '' 
 Mr. Minor's $3-million horse, Fierce Wind, did not finish a race at Belmont last June and has not raced since. 
 Despite these setbacks, Mr. Minor said he is still very much in the game. Renovation of Le Petit Trianon will commence this summer. He talked excitedly about a new venture, a company developing high tech propulsion systems and hulls for yachts and other seacraft. 
 Alpha Yachts, he said proudly, will come out with its first pleasure craft in 18 months.

HEADLINE: Yanni Liu, Kapil Mohabir

BYLINE: By PAULA SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
Yanlin Liu and Kapil Mohabir were married Saturday evening in Brooklyn. James Raybould, a friend of the couple who became a Universal Life minister for the occasion, officiated in Brooklyn Bridge Park. 
 The couple, both 30, met at Harvard, from which they received M.B.A.'s. 
 The bride is known as Yanni. Until April she was an associate in Greenwich, Conn., with TBL Capital, a venture fund in Sausalito, Calif. In September, she is to become an investment manager in Nassau, the Bahamas, for Inventages Venture Capital Investments, a Swiss firm. She graduated magna cum laude from Dartmouth. 
 She is the daughter of Xiaobu Alice Lian and Shaoying Liu of Macungie, Pa. The bride's father is a software developer there. Her mother is a database administrator in Bethlehem, Pa., for Synchronoss Technologies.
 The bridegroom is an associate specializing in mergers and acquisitions in the Manhattan office of Moelis & Company, an investment bank. He graduated from New York University. 
 He is the son of Satti Mohabir and Brihaschand Mohabir of Fresh Meadows, Queens. His mother is a registered nurse at Forest Hills Hospital in Queens. His father is an electrician for New York City Transit in Brooklyn.
 Ms. Liu and Mr. Mohabir, who grew up 9,000 miles apart, she in China and he in Guyana, first met in 2006. But it was not until the fall of 2007, when Ms. Liu moved into his building, that things took a serious turn.
 On their walks to class they discovered that each moved to the United States at age 12, and each had similar childhood experiences like riding bicycles they had long outgrown because their families were saving their money for the journey. 
 In an e-mail message, Ms. Liu wrote about a conversation she had with Mr. Mohabir during which ''his face looked stunned'' after she told him how it hadn't made sense to get a bigger bike only to leave it behind. Mr. Mohabir explained his reaction to her, also in an e-mail message: ''I have never told anyone the story of outgrowing my first bike and sticking with it till we immigrated, and here was a woman who grew up on the opposite end of the earth and had the exact same experience.'' 
 Coming from similar economic backgrounds, they remembered quite well the experience of adjusting to a new country while their parents worked at night to train for new careers.
 They also discovered their plans for the future were in synch. While at Harvard in 2008, they teamed up for a business plan competition, presenting a project that focused on sustainable agricultural development in Guyana. Since graduating, they have continued to work with the Guyanese government on its development, and even plan to spend their honeymoon there.
 ''It will be a bit of a working holiday,'' Mr. Mohabir said. PAULA SCHWARTZ

HEADLINE: Assessor's Race Centers on Balance of Tax Burden

BYLINE: By DARNELL LITTLE and DAN MIHALOPOULOS

 BODY:
Homeowners have been far less successful than businesses in winning appeals for lower property tax assessments, a Chicago News Cooperative analysis shows -- a discrepancy that strikes at a key issue in the race to replace James Houlihan, the retiring Cook County assessor.
 An examination of data found that from 2006 through 2008, Mr. Houlihan's office granted tax cuts to only 17.3 percent of appeals on residential parcels, while non-residential property appeals during the same period were granted more than 40 percent of the time.
 The analysis of records from the assessor's office, which covered decisions on more than 671,000 parcels, also revealed that successful non-residential appeals got tax breaks averaging more than 25 percent, compared with an average reduction of 15 percent for successful homeowner appeals.
 Mr. Houlihan is retiring at the end of this year after 12 years in office, and his departure from the relatively low-profile, yet highly influential post has unleashed a fierce and unusual campaign to replace him in the Nov. 4 election. 
 Amid the recession, much of the debate between the candidates revolves around how the election would affect homeowners hit with sharply higher property tax bills and whether the balance of the tax burden is split fairly between residential taxpayers and businesses.
 In the heavily Democratic county, Joseph Berrios, the winner of the party's primary in February, initially seemed poised to succeed Mr. Houlihan. Besides being the chairman of the county Democratic Party and a lobbyist in Springfield, Mr. Berrios has experience in property tax appeals as the longest-serving member on the three-man Cook County Board of Review. The panel also reviews assessments and has the power to reduce values.
 Property owners can appeal to the county assessor's office or to the Board of Review. Disputes can also wind up in the court system.
 The biggest obstacle for Mr. Berrios could be another longtime Democratic politician, Forrest Claypool. Shortly after Mr. Berrios won a surprisingly narrow victory in the primary, Mr. Claypool announced plans to run for assessor as an independent in the November election.
 Mr. Claypool is best known for his close loss to the ailing John Stroger in the 2006 Democratic primary for president of the Cook County Board. Mr. Claypool this year passed on the chance to challenge Todd Stroger, Mr. Stroger's son and successor, and he now is busy amassing the signature petitions needed to get on the ballot as an independent candidate for assessor. That is not an easy feat, given Illinois's campaign laws that often frustrate those who try to operate outside the two-party system. Mr. Claypool must amass 25,000 signatures by June 20.
 Mr. Claypool said his campaign for assessor was motivated primarily by his desire to help homeowners who are struggling to pay their property taxes.
 Ten years ago, the total assessed value of commercial properties and of residential parcels in Cook County was roughly even. The balance has since shifted so that a vast majority of the tax burden now falls on homeowners.
 Mr. Claypool notes that Mr. Berrios, in his 21 years as a Board of Review commissioner, has relied heavily on campaign donations from lawyers who appear before the board, often on behalf of major commercial property owners. Property tax lawyers have donated about $3 million to his campaigns in the past decade, almost two-thirds of all political contributions that have gone into Mr. Berrios's war chest. Mr. Claypool said he would not take any campaign donations from tax-appeal lawyers.
 ''There is a Berrios tax shift that takes place every year when he gives out these hard-to-explain tax cuts to his friends and campaign donors,'' Mr. Claypool said in an interview last week. ''It's the homeowners who end up making up the difference in higher property taxes.''
 In addition to reviewing the assessor's actions, a computer-assisted analysis examined Board of Review decisions on appeals affecting almost 800,000 properties from 2006 through 2008.
 Like the assessor, the board gave proportionately greater tax relief to non-residential applicants than to homeowners who had sought a break. At the board, successful residential appellants got an average cut of 10.3 percent, while commercial properties received reductions that averaged 17.6 percent.
 But homeowners were far more likely to get satisfaction from the board than from the assessor. More than 73 percent of homeowner appeals to the board resulted in at least some relief, the analysis found.
 Meanwhile, the rate of successful appeals by non-residential property owners was 45.3 percent, roughly comparable to the figure for the assessor's office.
 Mr. Berrios and other Board of Review officials asserted that the number of people getting some relief showed they did not treat homeowners adversely.
 ''The board has always been a homeowner's advocate,'' Mr. Berrios said. ''We pride ourselves on doing everything we can to help homeowners.''
 Scott Guetzow, the chief deputy commissioner for the Board of Review, said: ''I don't think there is any bias. It's politically popular to run and say you will help homeowners, but we've actually delivered for them.''
 Mr. Houlihan and Mr. Berrios are feuding over a variety of matters, accusing each other of being responsible for delays in sending out tax bills. But aides for both men said their offices should bear no blame for giving bigger breaks on average to non-residential property owners rather than to homeowners.
 The aides said it was more difficult for them to accurately set the values of commercial properties than homes, allowing more latitude for successful appeals on those buildings.
 ''Commercial properties don't lend themselves to the same sort of cookie-cutter analysis as residential properties,'' said Thomas Jaconetty, chief of staff to Mr. Berrios and one of the lawyers for the county Democratic Party who plan to challenge the validity of signatures on Mr. Claypool's nominating petitions.
 Eric W. Herman, a spokesman for Mr. Houlihan, said commercial properties were unlike homes in that they ''tend to be unique and have individualized circumstances.''
 ''With commercial appeals, we often receive new data on vacancy, income, expenses and other economic factors that change year by year,'' Mr. Herman said, adding that this can give officials better reason to grant a break to owners of non-residential parcels.
 The success rate of homeowners who seek breaks from Mr. Houlihan's office has declined, Mr. Herman said, partly because the office ''has made it easier for homeowners to appeal, greatly increasing the number of people who do so.''
 William Ahern, a spokesman for the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan group in Washington that advocates for lower taxes, said it was wrong to assume that lowering residential taxes and shifting the burden to commercial properties would be preferable to the current situation. Higher taxes for commercial properties could cause businesses to pass on those costs to consumers, he said.
 In the end, the assessor and the board decide how the tax burden is divided. How much revenue has to be generated through property taxes is up to the leaders of local government, schools and other agencies that levy taxes.
 ''Property taxes can only be lowered if politicians in Cook County spend less,'' Mr. Ahern said. ''The battle between residential and non-residential owners is a distraction from the real problem of higher spending.''

CORRECTION-DATE: June 20, 2010

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Because of an editing error, an article last Sunday about the election for Cook County assessor misstated the deadline for independent candidates to collect 25,000 signatures to get on the ballot. It is this Monday -- not Monday, June 28.

To the Editor:
 Re ''Entrepreneur or Unemployed?'' (Op-Ed, June 2): 
 I am one of the entrepreneurs Robert B. Reich, a secretary of labor in the Clinton administration, describes. I am 42 and started my own consulting business after a frustrating job search. And I absolutely agree that what my business needs more than easy credit is steady income and the ability to save against retirement.
 I have very few overhead expenses for which a loan would be necessary. But I do have two children to put through college and a mortgage to pay. The ''earnings insurance'' that Mr. Reich proposes would go a long way toward helping make self-employment a viable option.

HEADLINE: LETTERS: A Tax, or Not, On Soda

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Can a Soda Tax Save Us From Ourselves?'' (Economic View, June 6): 
 If soda is taxed, N. Gregory Mankiw asks in the column, will products like ice cream and fried foods be next? And his final question -- Do you trust government enough to make it your guardian? -- seems to suggest that government shouldn't be in the business of micro-managing what we eat or how we behave.
 Fine. But there are plenty of other arguments for the soda tax:
 Soda is often consumed all day long, and is more readily available than fast food. 
 Farm subsidies make high-fructose corn syrup, and therefore most sweetened beverages, artificially cheap, which encourages overconsumption.
 Soda is more easily defined than fast foods, which vary greatly in nutritional value. It would be hard to determine which fast foods should be taxed. 
 Soda and fast foods are not good substitutes for one another, so taxing soda wouldn't, for example, make people eat more fried chicken.
 Finally, it's better to do something than nothing. The soda tax would be a huge step in the right direction. Ron Cronovich

HEADLINE: Strasburg Has A Big Job Ahead of Him

 BODY:
To the Sports Editor:
 Re ''A Beginning That Thrills to the End,'' June 9: The downside to the spectacular debut of the Washington Nationals' Stephen Strasburg is that he has been made into a larger-than-life figure who was firmly planted on the path of greed before he ever threw a pitch. 
 The $15.1 million Strasburg received to sign is more money than anyone could spend. What does he have to aspire to as he advances? How long will it be before he is traded to the Yankees, probably the only team that can afford him? What does this do to the economics of baseball and to the prospects of small-market teams?
 Strasburg pitched a thrilling game, which even this Pittsburgh Pirates fan anticipated with excitement and watched in astonishment, but. ... 
 If Strasburg is able to remember that he is a human being as the years pass, he will be a truly extraordinary figure. That task, though, shall be enormous.

 Using Soccer to Save Lives
 To the Sports Editor:
 Re ''Playing Soccer, and Talking H.I.V.,'' June 11: Triad Trust's efforts in rural South Africa to encourage H.I.V. testing and dialogue at the community level are encouraging.
 Adolescents often do not know their H.I.V. status, or are afraid to discuss it. But Sarah Kate Noftsinger's compassionate approach is creating a participatory environment where youth become responsible for their future. 
 Programs that link soccer with health, education and community development have a potential to mold the minds and lives of young people, transform villages and catalyze positive, sustainable change. Soccer games not only serve to improve participants' understanding of H.I.V./AIDS and reproductive health, but also begin to break down entrenched societal stigmas. 
 The power of soccer needs to be harnessed in the most remote parts of the world. It is an international game that instills adolescents with a beacon of hope, peace, dialogue and change. One soccer game at a time, lives are saved.

 Add Offense, Add Appeal
 To the Sports Editor:
 Having watched portions of the first two World Cup matches on Friday, I was reminded of why soccer, in its current form, will never achieve the levels of popularity enjoyed by other sports in the United States. A total of two goals were scored, and one of the games ended in a 0-0 tie.
 These low-scoring defensive games are typical of current professional soccer matches. Games are often decided by one score resulting from a missed referee call or a lucky bounce. 
 For soccer to succeed in this country, and frankly make it a more exciting game worldwide, there is a need to open it to greater scoring. Changes along the lines made by hockey like more liberal offside rules would go a long way in providing more scoring opportunities. 
 This in turn would ensure that the winners truly deserved to win by their skills and not by chance. Doron Steger

 BODY:
''They may have more to cover up than either we thought or they told us.'' Bill Thomas, deputy chairman of the commission investigating the causes of the financial crisis, announcing that the commission had subpoenaed Goldman Sachs. 
 ''It's a real game of chicken, and I don't know who's going to win this one.'' Edward A. Kaplan, a benefits expert at the Segal Company, a consultant to big employers, on a fight between Walgreen and CVS Caremark. Two days after Walgreen said it would not fill prescriptions for customers in a new CVS Caremark plan, CVS Caremark said anyone in its plans would have to stop using Walgreen within a month.

HEADLINE: Top 2 G.O.P. Candidates Don't Reflect the Valley

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEBER. 
Jonathan Weber is the editor in chief of The Bay Citizen. jweber@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
For Tom Campbell, the moderate Republican who was thrashed in the California Senate primary last week, it must be tough seeing Carly Fiorina, his victorious opponent, and Meg Whitman, the Republican candidate for governor, anointed as the new political vanguard of Silicon Valley.
 This is a prize that by all rights should belong to Mr. Campbell. For more than three decades, the one-time law professor and member of Congress has positioned himself as just the kind of smart, socially liberal and fiscally conservative politician whom high-tech business leaders could love. 
When Silicon Valley computer chip makers needed someone in Washington who ''got it'' in the late 1980s, as they fought for their survival against Japanese imports, Mr. Campbell stood up. More recently, when green-energy entrepreneurs needed credibly pro-business advocates for environmental protection, Mr. Campbell was there.
 At a time when the Republican Party is riding anti-immigration, anti-abortion and anti-gay-rights platforms to victory around the country, Mr. Campbell mostly rejected those themes, which are anathema to the creative class that drives Silicon Valley.
 Mr. Campbell certainly convinced his base, beating Ms. Fiorina 49 percent to 32 percent in Santa Clara County, and also outpolling her in neighboring San Mateo County. But statewide, Ms. Fiorina, the former Hewlett-Packard chief executive, cruised to a lopsided 56 percent to 22 percent victory.
 Ms. Fiorina's success partly reflects the rightward march of the Republican Party, and it partly reflects the longstanding grip of conservative Southern California Republicans on the state party. But it also exposes the ancient split between business-oriented Republicans and the social-issue conservatives who have become the Republican base. 
 There is little doubt where Silicon Valley is positioned. 
 The tech and Internet industries are bastions of successful first-generation immigrants; when I asked a few venture capitalists recently about their political concerns, securing more visas for skilled foreign workers was at the top of the list. Illegal migration across the Mexican border is a somewhat different issue, but it does not seem to be a big concern.
 When it comes to same-sex marriage, it's a good rule that industries which rely on creative talent have no time for politicking over people's lifestyles. 
 On education, environment and infrastructure, Silicon Valley denizens have far more in common with Mr. Campbell. A recent study from the nonpartisan partnership Joint Venture: Silicon Valley pleads for re-investment in education and sustainability, and generally reads like an excerpt from a moderate Republican's playbook.
 AnnaLee Saxenian, an economic geographer and a dean at the University of California, Berkeley, who has long studied the valley, said she was ''shocked'' to see Ms. Fiorina and Ms. Whitman portrayed as representative of a Silicon Valley worldview. 
 ''People there are much more in the mold of Tom Campbell,'' Ms. Saxenian said. ''They are concerned about a set of issues that you hardly hear about from Carly and Meg.''
 Further, neither Ms. Fiorina nor Ms. Whitman is truly a Silicon Valley entrepreneur. Ms. Fiorina climbed the corporate ladder at AT&T before her tumultuous tenure atop H-P. Ms. Whitman was a Bain & Co. consultant who worked in the toy business before being recruited to run eBay. Management consultants and phone company executives are viewed in the start-up community as anti-entrepreneurs -- the people whose arrival signifies, at best, the end of the fun part.
 Mr. Campbell is no entrepreneur either. But he is famously intelligent, with a law degree from Harvard and a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Chicago -- and raw smarts is one of the few things other than start-up success that commands respect in Silicon Valley. 
 Ms. Fiorina and Ms. Whitman will move to the center for the general election and portray themselves as can-do chief executives who will bring valley business acumen to Washington and Sacramento, respectively. 
 Mr. Campbell, who has now lost three Senate races, is most likely done pursuing statewide office. But it's worth remembering, when Ms. Fiorina and Ms. Whitman tout their Silicon Valley pedigrees, that they are anything but representative of the way most in the valley think.

HEADLINE: A Disaster, Privately Managed

BYLINE: By DAVID CARR. 
E-mail: carr@nytimes.com; twitter.com/carr2n

 BODY:
The three journalists crept along in a boat captained by James Ledet in a bayou near Golden Meadow, La., one early afternoon. We were all looking for the same thing as we traversed narrow stretches of water framed by swamp grass, in a landscape dotted with docked shrimp boats and old oil rigs. 
 And before too long, we all saw what we were looking for, almost motionless just below the surface.
 A big ol' redfish. 
 Of course, these days, the only thing reporters go looking for in the bayous is oil, and its collateral effects, but this was back on April 16, four days before the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded 40 miles offshore. My buddies, both reporters at The Times-Picayune of New Orleans, and I were in the midst of what has become a semiannual outing to catch redfish, but we go mostly to spend time in the swamp, with its mysterious watery tentacles and to watch the sun drop as we sit on the deck of a big cabin on stilts. 
 But that's past. Cajun Resorts, the spot we stayed at, is buttoned up behind a widespread ban on fishing. Our captain, a former rig rat, has switched back to his old business and is now working with BP to limit the damage. When I called Poppy Duet, our Cajun hostess who helped cook up some of those redfish we caught, she sounded quietly beside herself.
 ''We've been closed for four weeks,'' she said. ''The oil's over in the next bay, not here, but we're all shut down. We're waiting and working on making a claim, but we don't really know what's going to happen next. We're watching the news, but it's really hard to tell what's going on.''
 She's not alone. Because the disaster was slow-moving, the full might of American journalism has been brought to bear. In one sense, the public has never been more informed. This is the first spill that has been covered in real time, with streaming high-definition video on desktops and televisions everywhere, network anchors racking up miles flying back and forth, and throbbing info-graphics that track the mess. We can all see the video for ourselves: an angry plume that looks like hell has been breached and is sending a dark, massive emissary to the surface.
 But to look for clarity amid the murk is a daily riddle. The size of the spill has been a moving target, with estimates recently doubled to 25,000 or 30,000 barrels a day, even after BP stanched some of the flow. 
 So what amount of oil was coming out of that hole in the first place? We will never know, in part because our government has never gained custody of information. What is clear is that even weeks into the disaster, public information has been privatized in whole or in part. Every disaster has chaotic elements and a need to maintain order and safety, but the economic interests of a large commercial enterprise are clearly impeding the free flow of information. 
 Journalists in the gulf are now dealing with a hybrid informational apparatus that does not reflect government's legally mandated bias toward openness and transparency. 
 The Coast Guard may answer the phone when reporters call the Joint Information Center set up to provide answers, but more often than not, the phone is quickly handed off to BP officials. As my colleague Jeremy Peters wrote last week, flights carrying members of the media seeking photographs of the disaster have been restricted, and news organizations including CBS, The Associated Press and The Times-Picayune have complained that their efforts to report have been hampered by limited access. And BP has refused to acknowledge giant plumes of oil under the surface that were observed by local residents and reporters alike.
 On Thursday night, Anderson Cooper of CNN complained about seemingly ridiculous efforts to control the story, including the fact that rescued oil-covered birds were being guarded and hidden from view by members of the National Guard. Tom Foreman, a CNN correspondent, tried to interview BP workers, but they would only say, over and over, as if working from a script, ''I am only here to support the cleanup mission.'' Mr. Foreman pressed and a guard intervened, saying, ''You can't do that! Sir! Stop! I can't allow you to do that!''
 An employee of the St. Bernard Parish government, who asked not to be identified because he was not officially authorized to speak on the matter, said that issues of access were primarily in the hands of BP.
 ''BP is running everything down here,'' he said. ''It's their show.''
 What had been a kind of detente between reporters and BP broke down at the end of May, when the efforts at a top kill were clearly failing but the company refused to acknowledge it. Reporters complained and asked for more accurate, timely information, and a BP official responded with a memorandum saying that the company was prevented from answering individual questions by disclosure rules governing trade in its stock. 
 ''Given recent volatility in BP share price, I'm told that information related to top kill is now considered stock-market sensitive, which means it has to be managed under disclosure rules for the London and N.Y. stock exchanges,'' the BP media official said in an e-mail message. ''In a nutshell, that means all investors must be provided information on an equal basis. That precludes me from sending you updates as various aspects of the operation unfold.''
 Really? Should the volatility of a company's stock price determine how public information on an environmental disaster be delivered to the public? 
 The lack of transparency has turned James Carville, a Louisiana native and a frequent contributor to CNN, into something very similar to John Goodman's character on HBO's series ''Treme,'' a Jeremiah who is shouting into a wind of indifference.
 Reached by phone on Friday in New Orleans, Mr. Carville said secrecy had a place in national affairs, just not this one.
 ''I believe this country is at war,'' he said. ''We are being invaded, but in this instance it's not Al Qaeda or the Japanese, it's just a hideous, greasy, stupid slick of oil that can't adjust to our tactics, so why the secrets? It's absurd that we have any secrecy around this, and absurd that the government is going along with it. There should be no limits on access, not for the scientists, not for the journalists, and not for the public that has every right to know what is going on down here and how much of the culture is being lost.''

HEADLINE: Studying Engineering Before They Can Spell It

BYLINE: By WINNIE HU

 BODY:
GLEN ROCK, N.J. -- In a class full of aspiring engineers, the big bad wolf had to do more than just huff and puff to blow down the three little pigs' house.
 To start, he needed to get past a voice-activated security gate, find a hidden door and negotiate a few other traps in a house that a pair of kindergartners here imagined for the pigs -- and then pieced together from index cards, paper cups, wood sticks and pipe cleaners. 
 ''Excellent engineering,'' their teacher, Mary Morrow, told them one day early this month.
 All 300 students at Clara E. Coleman Elementary School are learning the A B C's of engineering this year, even those who cannot yet spell e-n-g-i-n-e-e-r-i-n-g. The high-performing Glen Rock school district, about 22 miles northwest of Manhattan, now teaches 10 to 15 hours of engineering each year to every student in kindergarten through fifth grade, as part of a $100,000 redesign of the science curriculum. 
 Spurred by growing concerns that American students lack the skills to compete in a global economy, school districts nationwide are packing engineering lessons into already crowded schedules for even the youngest students, giving priority to a subject that was once left to after-school robotics clubs and summer camps, or else waited until college. 
 Supporters say that engineering reinforces math and science skills, promotes critical thinking and creativity, and teaches students not to be afraid of taking intellectual risks.
 ''We still hear all the time that little kids can't engineer,'' said Christine Cunningham, director of Engineering is Elementary, a program developed at the Museum of Science in Boston that offers ready-made lessons, for about $350 each, on 20 topics, and is now used in all 50 states, in more than 3,000 schools. 
 ''We say they're born engineers -- they naturally want to solve problems -- and we tend to educate it out of them.''
 The Obama administration's Race to the Top competition, which will distribute $4.35 billion in education stimulus money to states, favors so-called STEM programs, which stands for science, technology, engineering and math. 
 At the same time, Congress is considering legislation, endorsed by more than 100 businesses and organizations like I.B.M. and Lockheed Martin, to promote engineering education from kindergarten through 12th grade.
 In Manassas, Va., which has a thriving biotech industry, the local school district has spent $300,000 on a children's engineering program since 2008, equipping its six elementary schools with tool kits for projects like making musical instruments from odds and ends, building bridges with uncooked spaghetti and launching hot-air balloons made from trash bags and cups. 
 At the new Midway Elementary School of Science and Engineering in Anderson, S.C., kindergartners celebrated Groundhog Day by stringing together a pulley system to lift a paper groundhog off the floor. 
 But as these lessons have spread, some parents, teachers and engineers question how much children are really absorbing, and if schools should be expending limited resources on the subject. 
 Engineering is not a requirement in most states. (New Jersey is an exception: the state standards mandate some exposure to engineering by second grade.)
 ''Just giving kids an engineering problem to solve doesn't mean it will lead to learning,'' said Janine Remillard, an associate education professor at the University of Pennsylvania who is not opposed, but believes that good teaching is essential to making any curriculum work well. 
 She pointed out that schools have long offered project-based learning, without calling it engineering, like building Lego robots or designing a cushion for an egg drop. 
 ''Ideally, you want them to come away with knowledge that goes beyond that problem,'' Professor Remillard said. ''They could just go through the motions and end up with a robot that can do a particular thing, but the next problem they face will be a new problem. This is where good teaching comes in.''
 William E. Kelly, a spokesman for the American Society for Engineering Education and former dean of the engineering school at Catholic University in Washington, cautioned that engineering lessons for youngsters should be kept in perspective. 
 ''You're not really learning what I would call engineering fundamentals,'' he said of such programs. ''You're really learning about engineering.'' 
 Here in Glen Rock, where students have long excelled at math and science, administrators and teachers decided to incorporate engineering into the elementary grades to connect classroom learning to real life, as well as to instill social skills like collaboration and cooperation that are valued in the work force, said Kathleen Regan, the curriculum director.
 ''At first, everybody was like: 'Engineering? Kindergarten?' '' recalled Dr. Regan, noting that one school board member joked that she must be married to an engineer (no; a lawyer). 
 But now, Dr. Regan said, the engineering lessons have become so popular that children are talking about their projects at the dinner table, and some of their parents have started researching engineering colleges.
 Ms. Morrow and Jennifer Burke, who also teach classes for the gifted and talented, developed the engineering lessons and run them in all four elementary schools. 
 They plan multiday projects, often built around classic and popular stories like the Three Little Pigs, and take students step by step through the engineering process: design, build, test, evaluate. 
 ''They have to have the thinking skills of an engineer to keep up with all the innovation that's constantly coming into their world,'' Ms. Morrow said.
 First graders were recently challenged with helping a farmer keep rabbits out of his garden. 
 In teams of four, they brainstormed about building fences with difficult-to-scale ladders instead of doors and setting out food decoys for the rabbits. They drew up blueprints and then brought them to life with plastic plates, paper cups, straws and foam paper. 
 Then they planned to test their ideas with pop-up plastic rabbits. If the fences were breached, they would be asked to improve the design. 
 ''It gets your brain going,'' said Elizabeth Crowley, 7, who wants to be an engineer when she grows up. ''And I actually learn something when I'm doing a project -- like you can work together to do something you couldn't do before.''
 In the kindergarten class that was designing homes -- none out of hay, wood or brick -- for the three pigs, Ms. Morrow started the lesson by asking the 20 children sitting cross-legged on the carpet if they knew what engineers do. 
 ''They can write poems?'' one girl guessed.
 ''Well,'' Ms. Morrow allowed, ''they could write a poem about something they build.'' 
 But if they were still unsure about the language of engineering, the students were soon immersed in its nuts and bolts. 
 They tweaked their houses, adding ever more elaborate improvements to thwart the wolf. Then they huffed and they puffed.
 And not a single house blew down.

HEADLINE: For Forgetful, Cash Helps the Medicine Go Down

BYLINE: By PAM BELLUCK

 BODY:
It has long been one of the most vexing causes of America's skyrocketing health costs: people not taking their medicine.
 One-third to one-half of all patients do not take medication as prescribed, and up to one-quarter never fill prescriptions at all, experts say. Such lapses fuel more than $100 billion dollars in health costs annually because those patients often get sicker. 
 Now, a controversial, and seemingly counterintuitive, effort to tackle the problem is gaining ground: paying people money to take medicine or to comply with prescribed treatment. The idea, which is being embraced by doctors, pharmacy companies, insurers and researchers, is that paying modest financial incentives up front can save much larger costs of hospitalization.
 ''It's better to spend money on medication adherence for patients, rather than having them boomerang in and out of the hospital,'' said Valerie Fleishman, executive director of the New England Healthcare Institute, a research organization, who said that about one-tenth of hospital admissions and one-quarter of nursing home admissions result from incorrect adherence to medication. ''Financial incentives are a critical piece of the solution.'' 
 In a Philadelphia program people prescribed warfarin, an anti-blood-clot medication, can win $10 or $100 each day they take the drug -- a kind of lottery using a computerized pillbox to record if they took the medicine and whether they won that day. 
 Before the program, Chiquita Parker, a 25-year-old single mother with lupus, too ill to continue her job with special needs children, repeatedly made medication mistakes, although she knows she depends on warfarin to prevent clots than can cause strokes, paralysis, or death. 
 ''I would forget to take it,'' and feel ''like I couldn't breathe,'' she said. Or she would ''take two in a day,'' and develop bruises from uncontrolled internal bleeding. 
 But in the six-month lottery program, she pocketed about $300. ''You got something for taking it,'' Ms. Parker said. Suddenly, she said, ''I was taking it regularly, I was doing so good.'' 
 Skeptics question if payments can be coercive or harm doctor-patient relationships. ''Why should people who don't want to take medication be paid, when prudent people who take medication are not?'' said Dr. George Szmukler, a psychiatry professor at King's College London. 
 Joanne Shaw, who runs a department of Britain's National Health Service, asked: ''Will others think, 'If I behave like a potential noncomplier, I'll get money for taking medication?' And once you start paying people to take medication, when do you stop paying them?''
 Health experts wonder if people will realize their health has improved and maintain medication without money. Or must payments be continued indefinitely, even increased?
 Still, with patients forgetting medication, finding it inconvenient, fearing side effects, or considering it unnecessary if they feel better, important players are turning to financial rewards. Aetna, the insurer, helped pay for part of the Philadelphia experiment, and is considering using that or another method. 
 ''We've made our best efforts to say, 'If you didn't take your beta blocker or asthma medicine, you have a greater chance of ending up with a heart attack or dead or hospitalized,' '' said Dr. Lonny Reisman, Aetna's chief medical officer. ''It's going to take more. It's going to take incentives.''
 Aetna has begun paying doctors bonuses for prescribing medication likely to prevent problems: beta blockers to prevent heart attacks, statins for diabetes sufferers. Currently, 93,000 doctors are in Aetna's ''pay for performance'' program; bonuses average three percent to five percent of a practice's base income.
 CVS Caremark began by discounting copayments for employees of some corporations in its drug plans, to encourage prescription filling, and is studying ''the 'I'll pay you $10 a month to be adherent' approach, the lottery approach,'' and other incentives, said Dr. Troy Brennan, the chief medical officer. 
 Even the new federal health care overhaul includes incentives, expanding a program paying pharmacists extra for helping some Medicare patients learn to take pills correctly. 
 Experts say the psychological effect is more important than the dollar amount, which is usually just enough to seem significant. 
 Expecting failure, the Traumatic Brain Injury Network, a Columbus, Ohio, clinic for brain-injured patients with substance abuse problems, tried paying $20, in gift cards to grocery stores or restaurants, if patients completed their first treatment phase in 30 days. The one-time payment not only improved initial compliance, but ''they actually scheduled more appointments'' and stayed enrolled, said Dr. John Corrigan, the clinic's director. ''I didn't start as a believer,'' he said.
 The $20 helped propel Damand, 30, who had quit the program twice, to attend, even walking when he lacked bus fare. ''I've been taking my meds like I'm supposed to,'' said Damand, who took the card ''straight to the store,'' buying soap, tissues, chips. (The clinic insisted that patients' last names be withheld.)
 Although ''economically irrational,'' Dr. Corrigan said, small sums might work better than bigger ones because otherwise patients might think, '' 'I'm only doing this for the money,' and it would undermine treatment.'' 
 Even severely mentally ill patients respond to small payments. A British study in which patients are paid about $22 for regular injections of antipsychotics has kept some of them from being recommitted to psychiatric hospitals.
 ''We've had a least one patient say, 'Now I see the benefit of medication and take it regularly,''' said Dr. Stefan Priebe, a psychiatry professor at Queen Mary, University of London. But for most, he said, ''you would probably have to keep the incentive going.''
 The Philadelphia lottery project has worked with patients of varying income. 
 In his spotless suburban home in Willingboro, N.J., Bernard Davenport, 68, said it made taking warfarin ''like a game.''
 ''I didn't miss one time,'' he said, adding that he ''couldn't wait to get to the machine'' to see if he had won money for taking warfarin the previous day. 
 The project's co-leaders, Dr. Kevin G. Volpp and Dr. Stephen E. Kimmel, University of Pennsylvania Medical School professors, chose warfarin because it can be life-saving but also ''very dangerous if not taken faithfully,'' Dr. Volpp said. He added that many people ''who should be on warfarin are not even put on it because doctors don't think they'll be adherent.'' 
 The lottery was chosen for suspenseful entertainment, said Dr. Volpp, an economist who has studied whether incentives help people quit smoking, diet or do brain-training exercises. 
 Dr. Kimmel said patients win $90-a-month on average, reduced from $150-a-month because less money worked equally well. That $90 ''will pay for itself'' if it prevents two emergency clinic visits, he said. ''Prevent a cerebral hemorrhage or major clot, we save tens of thousands of dollars,'' he said.
 Results in two initial studies showed that many patients took improved warfarin use and that their blood-clotting levels stayed normal much more frequently. 
 Still, many said ''the incentive had nothing to do with it,'' Dr. Volpp said. ''They want to take credit for having done it on their own, not because somebody paid them,'' he said. ''Most people on some level actually want to do these things. And we want them to feel like they did it on their own'' to keep them adhering when payments stop. 
 But not everyone did.
 ''I really went backward,'' Ms. Parker said, after her participation ended. ''I'm just forgetting all over again.'' 
 Researchers are studying if longer-running lotteries will produce more dedicated medicine-takers. But given potential long-term savings, if payments must continue indefinitely, Dr. Volpp said, ''it wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing.''

HEADLINE: Report Says Pakistan Intelligence Agency Exerts Great Sway on Afghan Taliban

BYLINE: By CARLOTTA GALL; Sabrina Tavernise contributed reporting from Islamabad, Pakistan.

 BODY:
KABUL, Afghanistan -- Pakistan's main intelligence agency continues to provide financing, training and sanctuary to Afghan Taliban insurgents and exerts a far greater influence on Taliban strategy than previously thought, according to a report prepared by the London School of Economics.
 Drawing on interviews with Afghan Taliban commanders and former Taliban ministers and officials, the report suggests that Pakistan's premier intelligence service, the Inter-Services Intelligence agency, or ISI, supports the Taliban insurgency as a matter of official policy to contain the influence in Afghanistan of its rival India. Both serving and retired officials from the Pakistani intelligence agency are carrying out that policy, the report says. 
 Although many of the specifics of the report could not be independently verified, the bulk of its conclusions are very much in line with what Afghan officials, and some Western officials, have often alleged: that Pakistan has maintained its longstanding relationship with the Afghan Taliban to retain its influence in Afghanistan. The Afghan intelligence chief, Amrullah Saleh, who resigned last week after an insurgent attack on a peace convention in the capital, Kabul, described Pakistan as his country's ''enemy No. 1.'' 
 Officials in the Afghan government work closely with NATO and American security officials, and the groups share intelligence.
 ''This is not a big surprise. This is consistent with 15 years of history,'' said Bruce Riedel, a former C.I.A. analyst and now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. ''Life has not changed. The Taliban and the ISI have a very intimate relationship.'' 
 Pakistan has had close relations with the Afghan Taliban since the group's formation in 1994, but Pakistani involvement with the insurgency against the international coalition in Afghanistan since 2001 has been both high-level and coercive, the author of the report, Matt Waldman, contends. Mr. Waldman is a fellow at Harvard University who worked in Afghanistan previously for the humanitarian organization Oxfam.
 ''Without a change in Pakistani behavior, it will be difficult if not impossible for international forces and the Afghan government to make progress against the insurgency,'' he wrote.
 An official from Inter-Services Intelligence, based in Islamabad, Pakistan, dismissed the report as ''rubbish,'' and the report does not include any corroboration from Pakistani officials. 
 ''It's not even worth commenting upon,'' the official said by telephone, speaking on condition of anonymity in keeping with the policy of his agency. ''It's speculative, and degrading.'' He called the report's allegation that President Asif Ali Zardari met with imprisoned Taliban insurgents and pledged Pakistan's continued support ''completely outrageous.''
 That accusation was second-hand and several analysts said it was unlikely to be true.
 An American policymaker for the region said the inclusion of such a charge raised questions about the rest of the report. ''I am skeptical of this sort of sensational discovery that seems to do better than U.S. intelligence,'' said the official, who asked not to be named.
 The report quotes from interviews with nine insurgent field commanders, who say that ISI operatives sit in on meetings of the Taliban leadership council, often known as the Quetta shura, which consists of a dozen or so members and meets several times a year in and around the Pakistani southwestern town of Quetta.
 Afghan security officials and an adviser to the Afghan government working on persuading members of the Taliban to reconcile with the government have also said that ISI agents are known to sit in on the Quetta shura meetings as observers. 
 The ISI also exerts pressure on Taliban commanders, arresting those who step out of line, or threatening arrest if they do not follow established parameters of Taliban strategy, the report says. That allegation matches statements by Afghan and NATO officials, who have been working in recent months on ways to persuade Taliban insurgents to reconcile with the Afghan government. They have said that the threat of arrest or detention of family members by Pakistani intelligence is a major obstacle for insurgents considering defecting.
 ''You can believe all of that is happening,'' one NATO official said in an interview.
 The report says several Taliban commanders received training in large madrasa complexes in Pakistan from Pakistani military and ISI agents.
 The ISI had a role in the genesis after 2001 of the insurgent group headed by Jalaluddin Haqqani and his sons that has mounted some of the most damaging attacks in Kabul, according to the report. Among the Taliban commanders interviewed was one senior Haqqani commander of 1,000 fighters who also described the significant influence of the ISI over the group.
 ''Pakistan appears to be playing a double game of astonishing magnitude,'' Mr. Waldman concludes.

HEADLINE: Zenyatta Rallies, Setting Record in Style

BYLINE: By BILLY WITZ

 BODY:
INGLEWOOD, Calif. -- For a horse that carries herself with inimitable style, quaffing Guinness after workouts and prancing around the paddock as if she were preparing for dressage, Zenyatta high-stepped her way into the record books with a characteristic flourish.
 Coming from last place entering the final turn, Zenyatta hunted down St Trinians over the last 200 yards and passed her by a half-length to win the 69th Vanity Handicap on Sunday and set a record for modern-day top-tier thoroughbreds with her 17th consecutive victory. 
 Citation and Cigar each had winning streaks ended at 16, and there were more than a few in the crowd who thought Zenyatta's would end there, too.
 Zenyatta, carrying 129 pounds, 9 more than St Trinians, had to swing wide coming off the final turn and was initially unable to make up any ground on St Trinians as they headed for home. Then she found another gear.
 ''What a race, what a race,'' her owner, Jerry Moss, said after Zenyatta covered the mile and an eighth in 1 minute 49.01 seconds. ''Amazing.''
 Asked a few moments later if he was nervous when Zenyatta, who had turned in some lackluster practice times recently, charged down the stretch, Moss said he had faith in a horse that has never lost.
 ''I just thought she was going to get there somehow,'' Moss said. ''You never know. You're just hoping. I didn't get too panicked, so to speak. I don't know what I would have done if I panicked. It would have been the same look.''
 While Moss and Zenyatta's trainer, John Shirreffs, waited for their horse after the win, jockey Mike Smith stopped Zenyatta on the track and turned her toward the crowd, which rose to applaud her. He then took off his riding helmet and glanced toward the gray overcast sky.
 ''When we headed for home, I hit a real big gear and she hit another one right back at me,'' Smith said of St Trinians, who was ridden by Martin Garcia. ''I said, Whoa, she's serious. She's going to make me run. I was working at it until the last 100 yards and then I knew I'd outgrind her.''
 The victory, with a winner's purse of $150,000, pushed Zenyatta's career winnings to more than $6 million.
 That the landmark victory came at Hollywood Park was fitting. It is her home track, the site of her first race as a 3-year-old in 2007, and the place where she was paraded last November, a presumptive farewell trot, on Zenyatta Day.
 Hollywood Park, like the neighboring Forum that was once home to Magic Johnson's Lakers and Wayne Gretzky's Kings, has seen better days. Once a magnet for Hollywood crowds, the track will probably last only as long as the economic downturn. The Hollywood Park Land Company, which owns the track, is waiting for the economy to improve to go ahead with its plans to raze it and replace it with a residential and retail complex.
 The atmosphere was hardly forlorn Sunday. Typical weekend crowds number in the low thousands at Hollywood Park, but Zenyatta's presence on her bobblehead giveaway day increased that to a boisterous 12,232.
 When Zenyatta entered the paddock to warm up, the crowd surrounding it was five deep in places and fans packed the grandstand balcony that overlooked it. Bo Derek and Burt Bacharach were among those inside the paddock, hoping to watch a historic run.
 When Smith mounted Zenyatta, she pranced around the track while the other horses walked, occasionally letting her tongue hang out, like an equine Michael Jordan.
 It was that charisma -- and her seeming joy of racing -- that persuaded Moss to decide to run her this year after he retired her at the end of 2009.
 ''We brought her back because she loved her job,'' Moss said. ''Even though I emotionally retired her by myself, I hadn't talked to my wife, my partner. I hadn't talked to our racing manager or our trainer. She still had a lot of life in her. This is what she likes to do, this is where she lives. We asked John, can she do another year? He said, yeah, I think so. And we said fine, we'll unretire her.''
 The question now is, Where will she race next? And when?
 Moss has targeted the Breeders' Cup Classic in November at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Ky., with many fans wondering if they will see Zenyatta face off against Rachel Alexandra, a winner Saturday by 10 1/2 lengths in the Fleur De Lis Handicap at Churchill.
 ''There are a lot of races that are possibilities,'' said Shirreffs, who added that a run at Belmont Park remained a possibility. 
 ''We'll see how things are.''

HEADLINE: 24-Hour Read-In Protests Cuts to Libraries

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
It was the literary equivalent of a filibuster, a bookworm's take on 1960s-style protest.
 A 24-hour stream of sentences and stories, spanning the canon from George Eliot to ''Gossip Girl,'' flowed from dozens of book-loving New Yorkers this weekend who were concerned about austere budget cuts to libraries proposed by City Hall. 
 Not typically ones to raise their voices, librarians staged an overnight read-in on the steps of the Brooklyn Public Library on Grand Army Plaza to criticize the city's plan to close 40 branches by month's end, and to reduce hours and employees at those that remain. 
 The event's slogan: ''We Will Not Be Shushed.''
 ''In the Great Depression, the New York public libraries were kept open seven days a week,'' said Aliqae Geraci, a librarian in Queens and a coordinator of the event. ''It is a huge support system for the unemployed and the transient.'' 
 Another organizer, Christian Zabriskie, put it more bluntly. 
 ''We librarians have a saying,'' he said with a grin. ''You can close our libraries when you step over our cold, beaten bodies, chained to the doors.''
 The organizers are hoping the City Council will restore financing to avoid the cuts, which they say will particularly hurt the city's less fortunate, who depend on libraries for Internet access and employment help. The reading attracted more than 200 volunteer readers, twice the number needed to fill each of the 15-minute slots. 
 The marathon started at 5 p.m. on Saturday with ''Here Lies the Librarian,'' a children's story by Richard Peck featuring a gravestone on the cover marked with the word ''SHH!'' Texts ran the gamut from Woody Allen to classic works by James Baldwin and Isaac Bashevis Singer.
 ''Gossip Girl,'' by Cecily von Ziegesar, appeared at 1:30 a.m., courtesy of one of the event's coordinators, Lauren Comito, who runs a room for teenagers at a library in Flushing, Queens. ''We had so many serious things,'' she explained later, a bit frazzled after only two hours' sleep on a makeshift cot. ''I wanted to read something tawdry.''
 The ''Twilight'' series has since usurped the ''Gossip Girl'' series among Ms. Comito's adolescent patrons. So did she choose ''Gossip Girl'' for its cultural resonance in a city struggling with a hangover from its second Gilded Age? ''I didn't get that deep,'' she said.
 By the wee hours, the event had taken on a graduate school vibe. The Norton Anthology of Poetry emerged at 2 a.m., with selections from T. S. Eliot and Dylan Thomas, as empty pizza boxes began to pile up near a tent erected for napping activists. 
 Albert Camus and Bertholt Brecht made cameos. At 3:45 a.m., someone broke out Donald Barthelme, the postmodern short story writer and perennial subject of late-night lit-major debates.
 Ms. Geraci, the event's coordinator, chose to recite a Studs Terkel history of the auto workers' strike in the 1930s and the birth of the modern labor movement, as well as Emma Goldman's ''Woman Without a Country.'' 
 Besides her librarian duties, Ms. Geraci is studying for a graduate degree in labor studies, focusing on librarians' self-perception of their profession. Not enough of them, she said, view their work ''as being worthy of promotion.'' 
 They did on Sunday, sporting pins that read ''Save Our Libraries'' as they gathered in Brooklyn, attracting a few dozen curious passers-by. There were a few hours of children's stories, with free books handed out from a cart. A postcard and petition campaign urged listeners to write to politicians to oppose the cuts. 
 Some of the onlookers seemed more interested in the free pizza and coffee than any of the works of literature. But Elizabeth Nunez, a novelist from Brooklyn who read on Sunday afternoon, said she appreciated the presence of ''words in the air.''
 ''Just that people are listening to words and valuing words, I think that's important,'' she said. ''It may be they don't understand what's being said, but they know there is value to words.''

HEADLINE: In Deal-Making, Flat Is the New Up

BYLINE: By ROLFE WINKLER AND ALEXANDER SMITH

 BODY:
Some bankers made rosy predictions for a big bounce-back in mergers and acquisitions this year. Yet deal volumes in the United States are recovering as if the recession just endured was run of the mill. After two down years, the value of American corporate match-making is flat in 2010. That's no boom -- but if history is any guide, it's also nothing for bankers to complain about.
 After declines of 41 percent in 2008 and 22 percent in 2009, the value of announced deals in the United States so far in 2010, at $322 billion, is just a fraction off last year's pace. That pattern is in line with the last two recessions, according to Thomson Reuters data. The downturn of the early 1990s had three dry years, and the dot-com bust brought two. 
 So considering the depth of the latest recession, flat is the new up. True, some on Wall Street had forecast a more robust rebound. Goldman Sachs predicted ''a perfect storm for M.& A.'' late last year, pointing to cash-stuffed corporate coffers -- now at a record, according to the Federal Reserve -- and benign capital markets. Greenhill & Company also predicted 2010 would be big for deal-makers.
 But while last year's fourth quarter showed a promising return of deal-making -- like TPG's buyout of IMS Health and Berkshire Hathaway's acquisition of Burlington Northern Santa Fe -- the momentum hasn't continued.
 Some may find that surprising. After all, while many companies achieved profit targets through cost-cutting during the economic downturn, the juice has probably been squeezed from that lemon. Acquiring competitors and eliminating overlap is another way to find cost reductions. For instance, while CenturyTel and Qwest have been cutting costs on their own, they now hope their merger will yield more than $600 million more in fresh savings.
 The trouble is that even though the United States economy has stopped contracting, big risks still weigh on the animal spirits of executives. Job growth is anemic and credit markets have had renewed volatility in the wake of Europe's sovereign debt crisis. Such market turmoil may have played a role in scuttling Prudential's bid for the American International Group's Asian insurance business, and a $15 billion leveraged buyout of Fidelity National Information Services.
 Put it all together, and deal makers pining for more action should probably just consider themselves lucky to have any at all.
 World Cup Perks? 
 Spain, Portugal and Greece could all do with a good run of success in the World Cup. Economists reckon that the further a team progresses in the soccer tournament, which began on Friday, the greater the lift to its national economy. For all the hype, however, any benefit outside the tournament host, South Africa, will be short-lived. Some of the golden ball's shine may rub off on the victors. But, with 32 teams competing, there will be many more losers.
 Charles Kalshoven, an economist at ING, says that the further the Dutch team advances, the better it will be for the Netherlands economy, because retailers and restaurants will earn a better return on investments that they have made to capture the benefits of the tournament. Improved consumer confidence will also lead to higher spending.
 This effect could provide a welcome respite for the battered Spanish, Portuguese and Greek economies. Other governments struggling to impose tough austerity plans will no doubt be relieved by some temporary national jubilation if their teams do well.
 But the effect works both ways. For those teams that have to take an early flight home, disappointment on the field may be reflected in the national mood, both on at home and in the workplace.
 Besides, soccer success doesn't guarantee a sustained lift. Spain's historic victory in the European championship in 2008 may have given the country a short-term boost, but it did nothing for the economy in the longer run. Unemployment has doubled, to around 20 percent, from just below 10 percent, since the Spanish captain Iker Casillas lifted the Henri Delaunay trophy. Greece has fared no better since it defied the odds to win the European championship four years earlier.
 Expectations may be riding high, but soccer's superstars won't succeed where governments and central banks have failed. Miracles on the field are more likely than financial ones.

HEADLINE: After Some Demises, a Reinvented Food Magazine

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
MEDIA executives are behaving like the cast of ''Glee,'' belting out their new favorite Broadway tune, ''Food, Glorious Food.'' 
 Their performance thanks the purveyors of packaged foods that are advertising more as other marketers cut back. For instance, as budget-conscious consumers stayed home to eat, companies like ConAgra, General Mills, Heinz, Hershey, Kraft and Smucker increased ad spending in the first quarter by 12.4 to 81.2 percent compared with the same period a year ago, according to data from the Kantar Media unit of WPP.
 Among the media companies seeking additional ways to tap the flood of food ad dollars are the Hearst Corporation and Scripps Networks Interactive, which teamed up for Food Network Magazine; the Reader's Digest Association, which joined with Rachael Ray to bring out Every Day With Rachael Ray magazine; and Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, which publishes a magazine, Everyday Food, that covers fare like ''best burgers'' and ''simple grilled pizzas'' and attracts ads from prosaic products like Oscar Mayer hot dogs and Kellogg's Pop-Tarts. 
 Soon to join the parade is, well, Parade Publications, part of Advance Publications, which plans to introduce a newspaper magazine and a Web site under the Dash brand -- no relation to the Mrs. Dash brand of seasonings from Alberto-Culver or the Dash brand of detergent once sold by Procter & Gamble.
 Prototypes of Dash are to be shared with advertisers and agencies starting this week. Dash will present food articles and recipes meant to appeal to a mainstream audience -- primarily suburban women with children -- seeking quick, tasty meals to put on the table each day. That approach is encapsulated by the proposed Dash tag line: ''Simple. Fast. Delicious.''
 The online version of Dash is to arrive first, in September, at dashrecipes.com. (That Web address, for now, redirects visitors to the Parade Web site.) A preview issue of the print version is scheduled for November, to be followed by regular monthly publication beginning in February.
 The print version will, at the start, have a circulation of eight million and be carried by about 100 newspapers of the 540 that carry Parade. Dash will also provide editorial content about food that those newspapers can publish in print or online.
 Unlike Parade, which accompanies Sunday newspapers, Dash will be included in newspapers to complement food articles -- and advertising -- in the ''best food day'' issues, in industry parlance, published on Wednesdays or Thursdays.
 ''Newspapers are going through the rigors of the damned,'' said Jack Haire, president and chief executive at Parade Publications in New York, ''but they are coming out stronger and smarter.''
 ''In this crazy market, if you're going to grow, you have to innovate and move forward,'' he added.
 Newspapers can still offer advertisers opportunities, Mr. Haire said, citing data showing that ''newspaper readers represent about $14 billion a week in sales of grocery products, which is about 72 percent of the groceries sold.''
 Chris Chamberlain, president of The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, which has agreed to carry the print version of Dash on Thursdays, said it would ''nicely round out what we do with food and not replicate or duplicate it.''
 ''One thing I liked is that the recipes are interesting,'' he added, ''but you don't have to have an advanced culinary degree to prepare them.'' 
 To help differentiate Dash from other food publications, it will collaborate editorially with Parade as well as Bon Appetit magazine, part of the Conde Nast Publications division of Advance; the archives of Gourmet magazine, also part of Conde Nast; and the Web site epicurious.com, part of Conde Nast Digital. 
 ''With the partnership with those three great brands attached, there is some instant credibility'' for Dash, said Brenda White, senior vice president and publishing activation director at Starcom in Chicago.
 ''Launching a new publishing brand is a risky thing to undertake, but there is potential here,'' she added. ''It's an interesting proposition.'' Among the food clients of Starcom -- part of the Starcom MediaVest Group unit of the Publicis Groupe -- are Del Monte and Kellogg.
 The editorial collaboration between Parade and Conde Nast is the first, executives there say, between the two Advance divisions. And the decision by Parade to start Dash comes eight months after Conde Nast decided to cease publication of Gourmet with the November 2009 issue. 
 It seems counterintuitive that Advance would end one food magazine only to begin another, except that the ''accessible'' editorial approach of Dash is more ''in the wheelhouse'' of the giant food marketers, said Tracey Altman, senior vice president for special projects at Parade.
 ''We took some advertisers under the tent,'' said Ms. Altman, who previously worked on a newspaper food magazine named Relish, ''and they found the positioning extremely compelling.'' Ms. Altman's recent arrival at Parade generated speculation that Parade would be expanding in the food field. 
 Dash will compete for advertisers, and readers, with food magazines; magazines like Family Circle, Good Housekeeping and Woman's Day, which cover food among myriad subjects, and Relish, which has a monthly frequency.
 Since its introduction in 2006, Relish has grown in circulation to 15.5 million in 845 newspapers, from 6 million in more than 300 newspapers. Relish also has a Web site, at relishmag.com, along with events, books, podcasts, compact discs and a coming syndicated TV show.
 ''Imitation is the best form of flattery,'' said Carol Campbell Boggs, senior vice president and chief revenue officer at the New York office of the Publishing Group of America, which owns Relish.
 The way Dash ''is launching is a strong acknowledgment of the weakness of traditional magazine distribution and the strength of vital local-market newspapers to deliver an audience,'' she added. ''The fact that Gourmet and Bon Appetit content is moving to this format says a lot.''
 Even if the economy improves significantly and ''people have more money in their pocket,'' Ms. Campbell Boggs said, ''they will stay home more and eat at home more.'' 
 So if packaged foods are ''the bread and butter of advertising right now,'' she added, laughing, that trend ''is here to stay.''

HEADLINE: Partners on Some Work, and Opponents for the Prize: Control of the House

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Representatives Chris Van Hollen of Maryland and Pete Sessions of Texas shared an Easter Seals award in May for their Congressional work on behalf of people with disabilities. But only one of the two rivals can win another noteworthy prize that they are aggressively pursuing this year: partisan control of the House of Representatives.
 Mr. Sessions and Mr. Van Hollen are, respectively, the chairmen of the National Republican Congressional Committee and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, making them leading players in a battle for the House that is likely to make or break their political reputations and perhaps the Democratic agenda.
 Mr. Sessions, who failed in early bids for the House before being elected in 1996, has set the bar high, saying he will be satisfied with nothing less than a new Republican majority. 
 ''I have never been in favor of being in second place,'' he said.
 Mr. Sessions is working in a favorable political climate, but a recent special-election defeat in Pennsylvania has colleagues and analysts wondering whether the Republican committee has what it takes to produce the minimum 39-seat gain required to install a Republican as speaker.
 Mr. Van Hollen, who won a tough primary and beat a Republican incumbent in 2002 to enter Congress, has what President Obama recently described as ''one of the tougher jobs around'' in trying to hold off a Republican onslaught and protect the Democratic grip on the House. 
 ''We are obviously in an uphill battle,'' Mr. Van Hollen said. ''The only question is the steepness of the climb. I think we will hang on to the majority.''
 Mr. Van Hollen has the advantage of experience, having led the successful Democratic House campaign effort in the 2008 elections and managed a remarkable string of 11 special-election victories that ended May 30 when Republicans picked up a Democratic seat in Hawaii. In all, he can claim a role in the addition of 25 Democrats to the House.
 Tom Davis, who as a Republican representative from Northern Virginia headed his party's campaign committee for four years, said there was considerable benefit in having already done the job once. 
 ''Chris is smart enough to know what he doesn't know,'' Mr. Davis said.
 It was the fact that Mr. Van Hollen would not need ''training wheels'' that led Speaker Nancy Pelosi to lean on him to stay in the position, despite what was certain to be a bruising, seat-losing midterm election cycle that could wipe out the gains he had worked so hard to achieve.
 ''She made me an offer I couldn't refuse,'' said Mr. Van Hollen, who extracted from Ms. Pelosi an agreement that he could also work on Congressional policy as a special assistant to the speaker.
 Mr. Sessions, who took over the campaign committee after the 2008 elections after an unsuccessful bid for the job in 2006, is a close ally of Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the House Republican leader. 
 Mr. Boehner has made it clear that he does not intend to shake up his party's Congressional committee despite the outcome in Pennsylvania, which followed a bitter special-election loss of a Republican seat in New York in 2009. 
 The son of a former F.B.I. director, William S. Sessions, Representative Sessions sees himself as running the Republican campaign organization like a business. He managed to work in a partisan shot at Mr. Obama even as he described his committee's focus on recruiting local business owners for the ballot this year.
 ''Our model is more like a community leader as opposed to a community organizer,'' Mr. Sessions said.
 He has already felt the weight of the heightened expectations of Republicans who anticipate big things come November and who were badly disappointed when the party spent $1 million yet did not win the May 18 election for a blue-collar Pennsylvania seat -- the type Republicans must win if they want to recapture the majority.
 ''Republicans were stunned by the result,'' said Charlie Cook, a nonpartisan analyst of Congressional races. ''They expected to win, and now they are questioning why.''
 At a private House Republican meeting the day after the Pennsylvania defeat, Mr. Sessions took responsibility for the loss, and party leaders stood by him.
 ''He is a great team player, and he understands what is going on out there,'' said Mr. Boehner, who praised Mr. Sessions as bringing in more Republican lawmakers to play a substantive role in the campaign operation. ''He has gotten a lot of members involved, and they are doing real work.'' 
 Mr. Sessions said he believed that Republicans could capitalize on public fears about the direction of the nation under Democratic control of Washington, as well as what he portrayed as a Democratic economic approach that threatened the capitalistic system. He celebrated the results of last Tuesday's primaries, believing that Republican voters had chosen many candidates who would upend Democrats in the fall.
 ''Top-tier Republican candidates are solidifying the playing field and ensuring that the G.O.P. will challenge more than enough Democrat-held seats to put the majority in play,'' Mr. Sessions wrote in a post-primary memorandum to his colleagues. 
 Mr. Van Hollen, who is credited with building a potent ground operation that has been instrumental in the special-election victories, acknowledged that Republicans had an easier message to sell in 2010 by encouraging unhappy voters to simply toss out Democrats.
 He said Democrats intended to counter that approach by exploiting local opportunities in Congressional races and reminding voters of the record Republicans racked up in when they were in charge of Congress and the White House.
 ''Our challenge is to make the national election question not how do you feel about this country, but do you really want to bring back the guys who drove us into the ditch in the first place?'' he said. ''This election is not just about us. It is about us and them.''
 The conservative Mr. Sessions represents a North Dallas district with an increasing number of Democratic-leaning Hispanic voters, which could bring him competitive races of his own in the future. 
 Mr. Van Hollen represents the liberal Montgomery County suburbs of Washington and is considered a future Senate candidate. 
 The men have a cordial relationship from their work together on efforts to expand opportunities for those with disabilities; Mr. Sessions has a child with Down syndrome. Neither takes the other lightly.
 ''They have a huge amount of opportunities,'' Mr. Van Hollen said of Republicans in 2010. ''The question is whether they can manage it.
 ''To Pete's credit, they have put together a pretty good team on the Republican side. He is not trying to do it is on his own.''
 Mr. Sessions called his counterpart a ''friend who is deeply committed to his role.''
 ''Chris is a very smart, thoughtful leader and a good representative for making sure their agenda gets done,'' he said. ''I disagree with the agenda.''

HEADLINE: Obama to Press BP to Establish Escrow Account

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES; Clifford Krauss contributed reporting from Houston, Landon Thomas Jr. from London and John Schwartz from New York.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama will use his first Oval Office speech Tuesday night to outline a plan to legally compel BP to create an escrow account to compensate businesses and individuals for their losses from the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, administration officials said on Sunday. 
 It would be part of a week of activities intended to convey presidential command of a crisis that continues to test both the government and the company.
 Mr. Obama will press for the escrow account if BP does not establish one voluntarily. The board of the London-based company will discuss the idea and other spill-related issues -- including a brewing controversy over a big dividend for shareholders coming due this summer -- at an emergency session on Monday, company officials said. 
 But it does not expect to announce decisions until after its chairman and chief executive speak with Mr. Obama at a meeting he has called for midweek. 
 ''We are considering all these issues and look forward to constructive conversations on Wednesday in the White House,'' said Andrew Gowers, a senior BP spokesman.
 On Monday, the president will begin a two-day tour of three gulf states and return in time for Tuesday's prime-time, nationally televised speech.
 As critics continue to fault Mr. Obama less for his administration's overall response to the spill than for what they say has been his own slow and reactive leadership style, the ultimatum to BP and the president's use of the solemn setting of the Oval Office escalate his personal engagement to a new level. 
 Sunday's developments came after the administration gave BP engineers until the end of the weekend to speed up containment of oil that has been spilling into the gulf since the April 20 explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig that killed 11 men. The company used underwater robots on Sunday to position sensors inside the well to measure how much oil is spilling, The Associated Press reported.
 The robots were expected to insert the sensors through a line used to inject methanol, an antifreeze meant to prevent the buildup of icy slush, into the containment cap over the ruptured pipe, said a BP spokesman, David Nicholas. The work should be completed by Tuesday.
 The actions reflect the administration's efforts, nearly two months into the crisis, to telegraph a take-charge decisiveness when Mr. Obama and the federal government are all but powerless to actually resolve the calamity, given the sheer technological challenge of plugging a leak a mile below the gulf's surface. Mr. Obama's actions this week, together with events in Congress, put BP on the defensive more than at any other time since the explosion.
 While the BP board meets on Monday, Mr. Obama will make his fourth trip to the Gulf Coast since the disaster struck. It will be his first overnight visit and, after three trips to Louisiana, his first tour of the states to the east -- Mississippi, Alabama and Florida -- that are in the direction of the spewing oil's drift. With each trip, he has grown more critical of BP's response, channeling the increasing anger and desperation of coastal residents and politicians.
 On his return, Mr. Obama will speak to Americans from the Oval Office, a setting that past presidents have often used but which Mr. Obama never has, despite the gravity of the issues his administration has already faced, including the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression, and the president's signature domestic initiative, overhauling the health care system.
 The president's meeting the next day will be his first face-to-face contact with top company officials, after weeks of questions about why he has not done so before. BP has notified the White House that, as requested, the chairman of BP's board, Carl-Henric Svanberg, will come. He will bring along the company's embattled chief executive, Tony Hayward, who has been much criticized for statements that have been considered insensitive and self-serving.
 Mr. Hayward will be in the hot seat on Thursday as well, testifying before one of several Congressional committees investigating the spill.
 Although a containment cap has apparently reduced the amount of oil surging from the gulf floor, BP will face questions about last week's determination from government scientists that the volume of spilled oil has been as high as 40,000 barrels a day -- many times higher than BP ever acknowledged. Adm. Thad W. Allen of the Coast Guard, Mr. Obama's designated chief of the federal response, said on CBS's ''Face the Nation'' on Sunday that the ''mid-30,000 range is what we're looking at.''
 The installation of the sensors on Sunday was done at the request of the team of scientists, according to The A.P. 
 Admiral Allen also said he was expecting an answer later on Sunday to the administration's request that BP provide ''a faster plan'' to siphon off and collect the gushing oil, one with ''greater redundancy and reliability.'' The administration has said that while BP alone has the technological capability to stop the leak, it must take direction from Admiral Allen and other senior administration officials.
 The administration's demand for an escrow account, an idea that some gulf state officials had suggested earlier, in effect forces BP's hand. Administration officials did not suggest an amount. They said a fund, using BP's money, should operate like the fund established for victims of the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, which was financed by the government, with a third-party administrator to provide transparency and guard against BP too narrowly defining who is entitled to payments and how much.
 ''We want to make sure that money is escrowed for the legitimate claims that are going to be and are being made by businesses down in the gulf -- people who've been damaged by this,'' David Axelrod, Mr. Obama's senior White House strategist, said on NBC's ''Meet the Press'' on Sunday. ''And we want to make sure that that money is independently administered'' so those who have suffered losses ''won't be slow-walked on these claims.''
 Administration officials said that since last week, White House lawyers have been researching Mr. Obama's legal authority to compel BP to set aside money for claims, based on the 1990 Oil Pollution Act. The president decided to seize the initiative after reports from Britain on Friday that BP planned an escrow account, either to hold shareholders' dividends in reserve or to set aside money for victims' claims, turned out to be more speculative than the White House initially thought, officials said.
 If BP goes along with the concept now, the administration has put itself in a position to take credit.
 The issue of BP's planned $10.5 billion dividend looms as another potential point of contention. Mr. Obama has said BP should not be paying stockholders when gulf fishermen, oil workers and small business owners are saying they cannot get the company to pay their loss claims. 
 Legal experts are divided over the government's power to block a dividend.
 ''I'm not aware of any legal precedent that would give the government any authority that would preclude British Petroleum from paying dividends,'' said Joseph A. Grundfest, a professor at Stanford Law School and former member of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 BP's status as a foreign corporation further complicates matters, he said. ''There's no suggestion that British Petroleum lacks the money necessary to pay all claims or damages that might result from this calamitous spill,'' Mr. Grundfest said.
 But John C. Coffee Jr., a law professor at Columbia University, said courts have broad authority to issue injunctions. He also said the Justice Department or even state attorneys general could try to argue that the dividend would represent a ''fraudulent conveyance'' to keep money from flowing to claimants, though the burden of proof would be high. 
 As one of the richest oil companies in the world, BP has nearly $7 billion in cash on hand and the capacity to borrow about $15 billion, according to Wall Street investment reports. The company is expected to generate $34 billion from continuing operations this year, from which it had planned the $10.5 billion in dividends and $20 billion for capital investments.
 BP officials say that on Monday, the board would consider suspending or cutting the quarterly dividend, or paying it as an i.o.u. Executives said they could both meet their obligations from the spill and pay the regular dividend, but they conceded that political pressures could argue for suspending the dividend.

HEADLINE: Libertarian Talk, Now on Fox Business Network

BYLINE: By BRIAN STELTER

 BODY:
''Welcome to this struggle,'' Andrew Napolitano said triumphantly as he wrapped up the first television episode last weekend of his libertarian talk show, ''Freedom Watch.'' He saluted the camera and concluded, ''From New York, defending freedom, so long America.''
 He will be back next week, a commercial said, with a special guest, Glenn Beck. 
 Mr. Napolitano's struggle is for smaller government and individual liberty. ''The American public needs to know and understand, the government serves you better when it serves you less. That's the argument,'' he said on the show. 
 ''Freedom Watch'' is arguably Tea Party TV in its purest form to date.
 It is the latest product of the News Corporation, led by Rupert Murdoch, and being shown on the weekends on the Fox Business Network, which is searching for higher ratings by adding provocative commentators.
 Fox News already dominates the market for conservative TV talk with hosts like Mr. Beck and Sean Hannity, and has generated billions in revenue to show for it. Now, the upstart Fox Business is making room for libertarian talk, too. An aggressive pro-civil liberties, anti-government streak is evident on both ''Freedom Watch'' and ''Stossel,'' a weekly Fox Business show hosted by the former ABC News anchor John Stossel that was added last fall.
 As any libertarian will tell you, there are sharp differences in opinions between conservatives and libertarians, and now Fox has programs for both.
 ''I think Fox is seeing a business opportunity here,'' said Jacob G. Hornberger, the president of the Future of Freedom Foundation, a libertarian educational group.
 In an interview, he said, ''There's always been this debate between left and right, liberals and conservatives. All of a sudden here's Napolitano saying, where do you stand on this libertarian position?'' Libertarian commentators, he said, have largely been locked out of TV debates in the past.
 With its emphasis on out-of-control government and with Mr. Napolitano's warning last weekend that the United States was ''halfway to socialism,'' ''Freedom Watch'' could be seen as a reaction to the policies of President Obama and a Congress controlled by Democrats. In the past, the host has also been critical of the Bush administration for fear-mongering about terrorism and curtailing civil liberties. 
 The Web was essentially an incubator for Mr. Napolitano, who has been a legal commentator for Fox known as ''the judge'' for more than a decade. ''Freedom Watch'' started as a weekly webcast on FoxNews.com early in 2009, and later ramped up its production to several days a week. 
 On the webcasts, Mr. Napolitano discussed libertarian hot topics like states' rights, excessive overseas spending and draconian drug laws.
 This month, Fox confirmed that he was getting a weekly TV show, beginning on Saturday mornings and replaying in prime time on Saturdays and Sundays. 
 The first TV episode was billed as a ''Tea Party summit,'' with appearances by the Fox pundit Sarah Palin; Representative Ron Paul, Republican of Texas; and his son Rand Paul, a Republican and candidate in Kentucky for the United States Senate. (The elder Mr. Paul endorsed and wrote a forward for Mr. Napolitano's most recent book.)
 Also on the show were three Tea Party favorites, Senator Jim DeMint of South Carolina, Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota and the former House majority leader Dick Armey of Texas, Republicans all, or ''freedom fighters,'' as the host called them. The lone Democratic guest was Gov. Edward G. Rendell of Pennsylvania.
 ''You know I love the tea parties,'' Mr. Napolitano remarked at one point.
 Fox News received both credit and condemnation last year for drawing national attention to the Tea Party movement. Last summer, after a Tea Party protest in Washington, Fox even mocked other news organizations for not paying enough attention. In a print advertisement it asked, ''How did ABC, CBS, NBC, MSNBC and CNN miss this story?''; in fact, each network had covered the protests.
 ''Fox News created the Tea Party with the town halls last year,'' said the liberal commentator Bill Press, the author of the forthcoming ''Toxic Talk: How the Radical Right Has Poisoned America's Airwaves.'' Referring to ''Freedom Watch,'' he said, ''Now they've given the Tea Party its own TV show.''
 Fox executives have said that the network's news division covers the movement, but does not favor it.
 Through a spokeswoman, Mr. Napolitano declined an interview request on Friday. In an appearance to promote the show last week on the highest-rated hour on Fox News, ''The O'Reilly Factor,'' he said his intent was ''to be the night watchman for the public, to expose when the government does wrong things, steals property, steals freedom, violates the Constitution.''
 Lew Rockwell, the chairman of the libertarian Ludwig von Mises Institute and, like Mr. Hornberger, a regular guest on Mr. Napolitano's webcasts, said he considered ''Freedom Watch'' to be ''the most important libertarian broadcast in the history of the American media.''
 ''There has never been a show willing to address the difficult subjects involving liberty as this one does, let alone to do it so effectively and entertainingly. And Republican statism gets no free pass,'' he said in an e-mail message.
 Mr. Napolitano seems to be part of a retooling at Fox Business, which started in 2007 as a competitor to CNBC. Fox Business, which has had trouble finding a loyal audience, does not subscribe to full Nielsen ratings. Saying it has had a ''horrible time getting ratings,'' Mr. Press said, ''I think they've just decided to make it the second propaganda channel.'' 
 Fox did not respond to his comments.
 Among other recent changes, Fox Business has added Charlie Gasparino, formerly of CNBC, and Gerri Willis, formerly of CNN, to support its business news regimen. Fox Business says ''Freedom Watch'' will address business topics, too, like economic liberties and consumer rights. 
 ''Resistance to the growth of government will continue,'' Mr. Napolitano said on Saturday, portending a lot of work ahead for the night watchman.

HEADLINE: In Albany, Questions On Averting A Shutdown

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE

 BODY:
ALBANY -- State leaders said on Sunday that they expected to pass another short-term emergency spending bill on Monday, averting a government shutdown, though they could not say exactly how they would muster enough votes in the narrowly divided State Senate to do so. 
 At the same time, negotiations over a broader budget deal appeared to have broken down anew, with Gov. David A. Paterson resisting a legislative proposal to cancel some of his proposed school cuts in exchange for accepting an administration proposal to eliminate a pool of unrestricted aid to New York City. 
 ''There have been all sorts of rumors that we're close to a deal,'' Mr. Paterson told reporters in his office on Sunday. ''I don't see that.''
 On Friday, in a sign of lingering uncertainty over the emergency spending bill, officials at the state's major agencies began circulating instructions to some of the state's roughly 200,000 workers detailing how to manage a shutdown. But major questions remained at many agencies as to what operations they would be permitted to continue.
 Mr. Paterson and the leaders of the Legislature cannot agree on how to close about $2 billion of a more than $9 billion budget gap projected for the year. 
 Like last week's emergency bill, the one to be voted on Monday contains not only appropriations for a week of government operations, but also a portion of Mr. Paterson's executive budget proposal for the year. If approved, it would cut some $175 million in spending on social services, including a state subsidy to the New York City Housing Authority, and an additional $151 million from programs for the mentally ill and for drug addicts.
 At least one Democratic senator, Ruben Diaz Sr., said on Sunday that he would not vote for the emergency bill if it contained Mr. Paterson's budget cuts.
 ''I'm not voting for it; I'm a Democrat,'' said Mr. Diaz, whose Bronx district is among the poorest in the state. ''Democrats are supposed to be the defender and the protector of the poor and the needy. Let the Republicans cut. I am not cutting any more.''
 The Democrats have a narrow 32-to-30 majority in the Senate, and it takes 32 votes to pass legislation like the spending bill. Without Mr. Diaz, that means the bill could pass only with the support of some Republicans, who have voted unanimously against the last few emergency bills. 
 State Senator Roy J. McDonald, a Republican from the Albany region, suggested on Sunday that he might be willing to vote for an emergency bill, but that he would have to see the final version on Monday before deciding. ''I don't want to see government shut down,'' he said. ''I'm going to be very reasonable, but I have to go in there and be the loyal opposition. I won't do anything to hurt my community.''
 A shutdown -- which officials said had never before happened in New York -- could prove catastrophic for the state, which has been functioning without a regular budget since the new fiscal year began April 1.
 It would mean that New York's agencies would not be permitted to pay salaries or issue unemployment benefits to some half a million New Yorkers. Aides to Mr. Paterson have concluded that the state would have to close most of its offices immediately, as well as courts and parks; shut down the state lottery; and cease local assistance payments to municipal governments. Notwithstanding a flurry of stimulus-related construction projects, the state would also be unable to pay contractors.
 ''We are not going to shut down government and risk the safety and livelihood of millions of New Yorkers,'' Austin Shafran, a spokesman for the Senate Democratic leader, John L. Sampson, said in a statement released on Sunday. ''As we continue to make progress on a final budget, we expect to pass the emergency extender and meet taxpayers' needs.'' 
 A legislative official involved in negotiations on the budget said that the Assembly and Senate had presented Mr. Paterson with the school aid plan on Friday after being encouraged by the administration earlier in the week. The plan would allow many suburban school districts to reduce property tax bills. But after seeing the plan, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, Mr. Paterson insisted on further concessions, including the Assembly's approval of his plan to reorganize the state university system.

HEADLINE: U.S. IDENTIFIES MINERAL RICHES IN AFGHANISTAN

BYLINE: By JAMES RISEN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The United States has discovered nearly $1 trillion in untapped mineral deposits in Afghanistan, far beyond any previously known reserves and enough to fundamentally alter the Afghan economy and perhaps the Afghan war itself, according to senior American government officials. 
 The previously unknown deposits -- including huge veins of iron, copper, cobalt, gold and critical industrial metals like lithium -- are so big and include so many minerals that are essential to modern industry that Afghanistan could eventually be transformed into one of the most important mining centers in the world, the United States officials believe. 
 An internal Pentagon memo, for example, states that Afghanistan could become the ''Saudi Arabia of lithium,'' a key raw material in the manufacture of batteries for laptops and BlackBerrys.
 The vast scale of Afghanistan's mineral wealth was discovered by a small team of Pentagon officials and American geologists. The Afghan government and President Hamid Karzai were recently briefed, American officials said. 
 While it could take many years to develop a mining industry, the potential is so great that officials and executives in the industry believe it could attract heavy investment even before mines are profitable, providing the possibility of jobs that could distract from generations of war.
 ''There is stunning potential here,'' Gen. David H. Petraeus, commander of the United States Central Command, said in an interview on Saturday. ''There are a lot of ifs, of course, but I think potentially it is hugely significant.'' 
 The value of the newly discovered mineral deposits dwarfs the size of Afghanistan's existing war-bedraggled economy, which is based largely on opium production and narcotics trafficking as well as aid from the United States and other industrialized countries. Afghanistan's gross domestic product is only about $12 billion.
 ''This will become the backbone of the Afghan economy,'' said Jalil Jumriany, an adviser to the Afghan minister of mines. 
 American and Afghan officials agreed to discuss the mineral discoveries at a difficult moment in the war in Afghanistan. The American-led offensive in Marja in southern Afghanistan has achieved only limited gains. Meanwhile, charges of corruption and favoritism continue to plague the Karzai government, and Mr. Karzai seems increasingly embittered toward the White House. 
 So the Obama administration is hungry for some positive news to come out of Afghanistan. Yet the American officials also recognize that the mineral discoveries will almost certainly have a double-edged impact. 
 Instead of bringing peace, the newfound mineral wealth could lead the Taliban to battle even more fiercely to regain control of the country. 
 The corruption that is already rampant in the Karzai government could also be amplified by the new wealth, particularly if a handful of well-connected oligarchs, some with personal ties to the president, gain control of the resources. Just last year, Afghanistan's minister of mines was accused by American officials of accepting a $30 million bribe to award China the rights to develop its copper mine. The minister has since been replaced. 
 Endless fights could erupt between the central government in Kabul and provincial and tribal leaders in mineral-rich districts. Afghanistan has a national mining law, written with the help of advisers from the World Bank, but it has never faced a serious challenge.
 ''No one has tested that law; no one knows how it will stand up in a fight between the central government and the provinces,'' observed Paul A. Brinkley, deputy undersecretary of defense for business and leader of the Pentagon team that discovered the deposits. 
 At the same time, American officials fear resource-hungry China will try to dominate the development of Afghanistan's mineral wealth, which could upset the United States, given its heavy investment in the region. After winning the bid for its Aynak copper mine in Logar Province, China clearly wants more, American officials said. 
 Another complication is that because Afghanistan has never had much heavy industry before, it has little or no history of environmental protection either. ''The big question is, can this be developed in a responsible way, in a way that is environmentally and socially responsible?'' Mr. Brinkley said. ''No one knows how this will work.'' 
 With virtually no mining industry or infrastructure in place today, it will take decades for Afghanistan to exploit its mineral wealth fully. ''This is a country that has no mining culture,'' said Jack Medlin, a geologist in the United States Geological Survey's international affairs program. ''They've had some small artisanal mines, but now there could be some very, very large mines that will require more than just a gold pan.'' 
 The mineral deposits are scattered throughout the country, including in the southern and eastern regions along the border with Pakistan that have had some of the most intense combat in the American-led war against the Taliban insurgency. 
 The Pentagon task force has already started trying to help the Afghans set up a system to deal with mineral development. International accounting firms that have expertise in mining contracts have been hired to consult with the Afghan Ministry of Mines, and technical data is being prepared to turn over to multinational mining companies and other potential foreign investors. The Pentagon is helping Afghan officials arrange to start seeking bids on mineral rights by next fall, officials said. 
 ''The Ministry of Mines is not ready to handle this,'' Mr. Brinkley said. ''We are trying to help them get ready.''
 Like much of the recent history of the country, the story of the discovery of Afghanistan's mineral wealth is one of missed opportunities and the distractions of war. 
 In 2004, American geologists, sent to Afghanistan as part of a broader reconstruction effort, stumbled across an intriguing series of old charts and data at the library of the Afghan Geological Survey in Kabul that hinted at major mineral deposits in the country. They soon learned that the data had been collected by Soviet mining experts during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s, but cast aside when the Soviets withdrew in 1989. 
 During the chaos of the 1990s, when Afghanistan was mired in civil war and later ruled by the Taliban, a small group of Afghan geologists protected the charts by taking them home, and returned them to the Geological Survey's library only after the American invasion and the ouster of the Taliban in 2001. 
 ''There were maps, but the development did not take place, because you had 30 to 35 years of war,'' said Ahmad Hujabre, an Afghan engineer who worked for the Ministry of Mines in the 1970s. 
 Armed with the old Russian charts, the United States Geological Survey began a series of aerial surveys of Afghanistan's mineral resources in 2006, using advanced gravity and magnetic measuring equipment attached to an old Navy Orion P-3 aircraft that flew over about 70 percent of the country. 
 The data from those flights was so promising that in 2007, the geologists returned for an even more sophisticated study, using an old British bomber equipped with instruments that offered a three-dimensional profile of mineral deposits below the earth's surface. It was the most comprehensive geologic survey of Afghanistan ever conducted. 
 The handful of American geologists who pored over the new data said the results were astonishing. 
 But the results gathered dust for two more years, ignored by officials in both the American and Afghan governments. In 2009, a Pentagon task force that had created business development programs in Iraq was transferred to Afghanistan, and came upon the geological data. Until then, no one besides the geologists had bothered to look at the information -- and no one had sought to translate the technical data to measure the potential economic value of the mineral deposits. 
 Soon, the Pentagon business development task force brought in teams of American mining experts to validate the survey's findings, and then briefed Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates and Mr. Karzai. 
 So far, the biggest mineral deposits discovered are of iron and copper, and the quantities are large enough to make Afghanistan a major world producer of both, United States officials said. Other finds include large deposits of niobium, a soft metal used in producing superconducting steel, rare earth elements and large gold deposits in Pashtun areas of southern Afghanistan. 
 Just this month, American geologists working with the Pentagon team have been conducting ground surveys on dry salt lakes in western Afghanistan where they believe there are large deposits of lithium. Pentagon officials said that their initial analysis at one location in Ghazni Province showed the potential for lithium deposits as large of those of Bolivia, which now has the world's largest known lithium reserves. 
 For the geologists who are now scouring some of the most remote stretches of Afghanistan to complete the technical studies necessary before the international bidding process is begun, there is a growing sense that they are in the midst of one of the great discoveries of their careers. 
 ''On the ground, it's very, very, promising,'' Mr. Medlin said. ''Actually, it's pretty amazing.''

HEADLINE: New Rules On Changes To Benefits

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The White House on Monday will issue new rules that strongly discourage employers from cutting health insurance benefits or increasing the costs of coverage to employees, administration officials say.
 The rules limit the changes that employers can make if they want to be exempt from certain provisions of the health care law passed by Congress in March. Many employers want the exemption because it allows them to keep their existing health plans intact with a minimum of changes. More than 170 million Americans have employer-sponsored insurance.
 The administration said the rules would allow a smooth transition to a new, more competitive insurance market that works better for consumers. But in some respects, the rules appear to fall short of the sweeping commitments President Obama made while trying to reassure the public in the fight over health legislation. 
 In issuing the rules, the administration said this was just one goal of the legislation, allowing people to ''keep their current coverage if they like it.'' It acknowledged that some people, especially those who work at smaller businesses, might face significant changes in the terms of their coverage, and it said they should be able to ''reap the benefits of additional consumer protections.'' 
 The law provides a partial exemption for certain health plans in existence on March 23, when Mr. Obama signed the legislation. Under this provision, known as a grandfather clause, plans can lose the exemption if they make significant changes in deductibles, co-payments or benefits.
 About half of employer-sponsored health plans will see such changes by the end of 2013, the administration says in an economic analysis of the rules.
 The rules allow employers and insurers to increase benefits. But, in a summary of the rules, the administration said, ''Plans will lose their grandfather status if they choose to make significant changes that reduce benefits or increase costs to consumers.''
 Some provisions of the new law apply to all health plans. In general, they cannot cancel coverage when a person becomes ill, and they cannot impose lifetime limits on benefits. 
 But ''grandfathered health plans'' are exempt from other requirements. In general, they do not have to provide ''essential health benefits'' specified by the federal government and they do not have to provide free preventive care.
 Under the rules, a health insurance plan can lose its exemption if it eliminates all benefits for a particular condition or if it increases deductibles or co-payments by more than the rate of medical inflation plus 15 percentage points. 
 Likewise, a health plan loses its exemption if an employer reduces its contribution so that its share of the total cost of coverage declines by more than 5 percentage points. If, for example, an employer is paying 60 percent of the cost of family coverage, it would run afoul of the rules if it cut its share to 50 percent. 
 An employer would also lose its exempt status if it increased co-payments for doctor's visits to $45, from $30 -- a 50 percent increase -- while medical inflation was 8 percent. 
 Some health plans require consumers to pay a percentage of the bill, rather than a fixed dollar amount. An insurer loses its special protection if it makes any increase in this percentage -- if, for example, it requires patients to pay 25 percent of the bill for surgery, rather than the 20 percent charged in the past.
 A health plan would also run afoul of the rules if it eliminated coverage for services needed to diagnose or treat a particular condition. As an example, the rules describe a health plan that covers a combination of counseling and prescription drugs for treatment of a particular mental illness. The plan would lose its exemption if it eliminated benefits for counseling.
 Some insurers cap the amount they will pay for covered services each year. If they want to retain their grandfathered status, they cannot reduce any annual dollar limit that was in place on March 23.
 About 133 million Americans are in group health plans from employers with 100 or more employees, the administration said, and most ''will not see major changes to their coverage as a result of this regulation.''

HEADLINE: 'Toy Story 3' to the Rescue?

BYLINE: By MICHAEL CIEPLY and BROOKS BARNES

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- Save us, Buzz Lightyear.
 Grumpy moviegoers have left the film business trying to dig itself out of a summer slump after a series of big-budget disappointments and the lack of a single blockbuster comedy.
 Memorial Day weekend attendance was the lowest since 1993. Box office receipts for the next weekend plunged 24 percent compared with the same weekend a year earlier. 
 Sony's remake of ''The Karate Kid'' sold a surprisingly strong $56 million in North America over the last three days, landing firmly in first place, but a much more expensive adaptation of ''The A-Team'' from 20th Century Fox fizzled with $26 million. 
 It was enough to put this weekend up 11 percent over the same one last year, according to Hollywood.com, which tracks ticket data. But total domestic box office revenue since early May -- when ''Iron Man 2'' opened with a bang -- has fallen about 6.4 percent, to $1.02 billion, from $1.09 billion in the period a year earlier, according to Hollywood.com. 
 So it will take more than a robust performance from ''The Karate Kid'' to truly kick-start Hollywood's summer, the period between early May and Labor Day that typically accounts for 40 percent of annual ticket sales. Indeed, now comes the hard part: convincing turned-off consumers that studios have held back the good stuff.
 The best chance for studios to prove that the down cycle has actually broken, box office analysts and others say, is the arrival on Friday of ''Toy Story 3,'' starring Buzz Lightyear and pals. It is the long-anticipated third installment (this time in 3-D) in a series that helped Pixar establish computer-animated family fare as the film industry's most reliable moneymaker.
 ''Toy Story 2'' opened with more than $75 million in 1999, when adjusted for inflation. Hollywood hopes the follow-up will handily beat that total, delivering the kind of opening weekend tally that the industry expects from its big-budget, heavily marketed releases.
 Still, it may be tough to win back the favor of an audience that has been trained to expect more than Hollywood has delivered in the last few weeks. One danger is that potential filmgoers tend to overlook a next round of pictures when they did not like the last batch.
 ''It's all about changing their mood,'' Dennis Rice, a marketing consultant who previously ran Disney's publicity operation, said of the entertainment business.
 Kevin Goetz, chief executive of Screen Engine, a marketing and research consulting firm that specializes in entertainment, says viewers increasingly reserve their ticket purchases for pictures that promise something truly special, whether that means amazing visual effects or extraordinary reviews.
 ''If you don't have a product that delivers in a unique and powerful way, then certainly the messaging has to do that,'' Mr. Goetz said. 
 A variety of other factors may be holding back the box office, including blowback from consumers over higher ticket prices. Perversely, the improving economy may have taken the edge off ticket sales that were buoyed last year, when filmgoers sought a relatively cheap diversion from financial woes.
 But the primary reason is most likely ho-hum movies. In the last few weeks, Hollywood's offerings have lacked luster. ''Sex and the City 2'' got some of the worst reviews in memory for Warner Brothers, while ''Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time'' from Walt Disney was received with a collective shrug. 
 New comedies like ''Killers'' from Lionsgate and ''Get Him to the Greek'' from Universal Pictures registered barely a blip when compared with ''The Hangover,'' the spring-summer comic juggernaut of 2009.
 And for all the talk about a 3-D revolution, only one major 3-D film, the hit ''Shrek Forever After,'' from DreamWorks Animation, has been released since May. At least four 3-D movies, including ''The Last Airbender'' from Paramount and ''Despicable Me'' from Universal, are still on deck for the summer.
 But those will arrive without the momentum that powered last year, when eight action fantasies and animated films topped $150 million each at the spring-summer box office. They were led by four -- ''Up,'' ''Star Trek,'' ''X-Men Origins: Wolverine'' and ''Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian'' -- that had already been released by this point in the year.
 ''Yes, there seems to be a slump,'' acknowledged Tom Sherak, who is a consultant for Marvel Entertainment and president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences -- and is generally known as an industry cheerleader.
 In some ways, the malaise mirrors what is going on at the studios. Universal is treading water, awaiting the outcome of regulatory scrutiny of Comcast's purchase of NBC Universal. Disney is trying to regain its footing after a management overhaul. Paramount has sharply reduced its release schedule. And after ''Avatar,'' which took in nearly $750 million at the domestic box office after its release just before Christmas, everything Fox releases looks a little tepid.
 If laughs are to salvage the summer, they will have to come from a somewhat bizarre face-off that on June 25 finds Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz, in the 20th Century Fox action comedy ''Knight and Day,'' opening against Adam Sandler, Kevin James, Chris Rock, Rob Schneider and David Spade in ''Grown Ups'' from Sony. 
 Among those seven actors, none has broken the $150 million mark since 2005, though Mr. James came close last year with ''Paul Blart: Mall Cop.''
 For Will Ferrell (''The Other Guys''), Julia Roberts (''Eat, Pray, Love''), Michael Cera (''Scott Pilgrim vs. the World'') and Sylvester Stallone (''The Expendables''), the summer's challenge is not so much to be a hit as simply not to flop again.
 Angelina Jolie may have a better shot with ''Salt,'' due on July 23 from Sony. But only once, with ''Mr. & Mrs. Smith,'' which had domestic ticket sales of $186 million for Fox in 2005, has Ms. Jolie scored a hit bigger than ''The Proposal.'' That romantic comedy starred Sandra Bullock and took in $163 million for Disney last summer, when the film industry had more good surprises than bad.
 Then, again, werewolves and vampires might save the day: ''The Twilight Saga: Eclipse'' is set for release by Summit Entertainment on June 30, bringing the presumed comfort that comes with a sequel built on two hits that had nearly $500 million in domestic box office sales between them.
 For last weekend, ''The A-Team'' was a distant second behind ''The Karate Kid,'' which starred Jackie Chan and Jaden Smith, who is Will Smith's son. 
 Sony executives were doing cartwheels over ''The Karate Kid,'' which the studio said cost only about $40 million to make. 
 ''I'm drooling into the phone right now -- just totally, totally thrilled,'' said Rory Bruer, Sony's president of worldwide distribution. ''It's a movie that has human themes that everyone can relate to.''
 ''Shrek Forever After'' was third with $15.8 million for a new domestic total of $210 million. ''Get Him to the Greek'' was fourth with about $10 million ($36.5 million total), while ''Killers'' rounded out the top five with an estimated $8.2 million ($30.7 million total). 
 Looking ahead, Hollywood can at least take comfort in knowing that ''Toy Story 3'' is the closest thing the film industry has to an easy sell.
 ''All they've got to do,'' Mr. Rice said, ''is have a big '3.' ''

HEADLINE: Maybe They Should Call It 'Greener Acres'

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
What do you get when you cross ''Green Acres'' with ''Queer Eye for the Straight Guy,'' then subtract Eddie Albert, Eva Gabor and most of the straight guys? A campaign for a new weekly television series seeks to provide a humorous answer to that quirky question.
 The campaign, now under way, is for ''The Fabulous Beekman Boys,'' which is to make its debut at 9 p.m. on Wednesday on the Planet Green cable channel. The campaign, created internally at Planet Green, part of Discovery Communications, attempts to whet the appetites of viewers for a reality series that takes a new tack in the fish-out-of-water genre.
 The campaign, with a budget estimated at $500,000, is the largest to date for a series on Planet Green, which replaced the Discovery Home channel on cable systems in June 2008. The campaign includes ads on television, online, on posters for commuter trains and on billboards. 
 There are also events, promotions, a presence in social media and some well-timed cross-marketing with a memoir written by one of the Beekman boys.
 The campaign is indicative of a trend that is changing the face of advertising in the wake of the financial upheavals of the last couple of years. As major marketers in recession-wrecked categories like luxury goods, financial services and travel cut back ad spending, consumers are seeing far more pitches from the companies that are still spending -- and, in many instances, spending more than before -- to promote themselves.
 Examples include makers of packaged foods, sellers of less expensive cars and purveyors of entertainment like movies, video games and, yes, television shows.
 Elaborate campaigns for TV series are proliferating, both nationally and in major markets like Los Angeles and New York. Most ads that are running now are from cable channels because they traditionally increase their promotional presence after the broadcast television season ends in late May.
 Among the shows being advertised are ''Burn Notice,'' ''Royal Pains'' and ''White Collar,'' on USA; ''True Blood,'' on HBO; ''The Glades'' on A&E; ''Hot in Cleveland,'' on TV Land; ''Dance Your Ass Off,'' on Oxygen; ''The Big C,'' on Showtime; a block of ''Bridezillas'' and ''My Fair Wedding With David Tutera'' on WE, billed as ''the Ultimate Wedding Sunday''; and the summer lineup of programming on TLC.
 How, then, can a newcomer like ''The Fabulous Beekman Boys,'' on a smaller channel like Planet Green, get noticed in the crowd?
 ''Being in advertising and marketing for 20 years, I ask myself that question every morning,'' says Rob Jacobson, senior vice president for marketing at Planet Green in New York.
 ''Standing out is the challenge,'' he adds.
 The solution, Mr. Jacobson says, is ''using the show, and the voice of the boys, to sell the show and the voice.''
 The ''boys'' are Brent Ridge and Josh Kilmer-Purcell, a couple of New Yorkers who moved upstate and bought a mansion and a farm in an effort to transform themselves from city careerists into bucolic businessmen.
 (''Beekman'' refers to the name of the mansion, built in 1802 in Sharon Springs, N.Y.)
 The campaign plays up the aspects of the docu-series, as Planet Green likes to call it, that bring to mind ''Green Acres,'' the charming CBS sitcom of the 1960s; the first season of the reality series ''The Simple Life''; and a lengthy list of movies about the madcap antics that ensue whenever city people try relocating to the country. They include ''George Washington Slept Here,'' ''The Egg and I'' and ''Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House.''
 (The ''Blandings'' antecedent is interesting because the real Mr. Kilmer-Purcell, like the fictional Jim Blandings, works as an advertising executive when not at home.)
 What gives ''Beekman Boys'' a contemporary spin is that Mr. Kilmer-Purcell and Mr. Ridge are life partners as well as business partners. That gives the show a ''Fabulous'' spin, too, as does a desire to echo the title of the 1989 film with Jeff and Beau Bridges, ''The Fabulous Baker Boys.'' 
 The centerpiece of the campaign for the series, composed of 10 episodes, is a commercial styled like a music video, in 30-second and 60-second versions, that is a tribute to -- and sweet spoof of -- production numbers from musical movies of the 1930s or 1940s.
 Mr. Ridge and Mr. Kilmer-Purcell co-star with 10 singing and dancing young women dressed in gingham blouses, denim shorts and high boots. There is a small menagerie of animals on hand, too.
 The set resembles the set of a vintage film about a couple that goes, as a lyric declares, ''from city slickers to farmhands.''
 ''When it comes to farming,'' the women sing, ''they've got no clue.'' Mr. Ridge chimes in, ''But the Internet told me,'' and Mr. Kilmer-Purcell, appearing on a computer screen, completes the thought with, ''Just how to.'' 
 The number ends with the Beekman Boys, in rustic garb, surrounded by the chorines as an old-fashioned sign bearing the name of the series drops into view.
 That voice is heard in dozens of wryly funny video clips that can be watched on a section of the Planet Green Web site (planetgreen.discovery.com/videos/the-fabulous-beekman-boys/). And it also infuses the commuter transit posters and billboards, as evidenced by the headlines above photographs of Mr. Kilmer-Purcell and Mr. Ridge in farm togs.
 ''They went from obsessing over BlackBerrys to growing them,'' one headline says. Another reads: ''Noisy. Crowded. Smelly. Turns out goat farming is a lot like their old commute.''
 ''In the creative process, we're capturing their personalities,'' says Laura Michalchyshyn, president and general manager at Planet Green.
 ''What we hope the audience will feel is a relationship dynamic,'' she adds, infused with ''humor, tension, drama, comedy, and eccentric at times'' to reflect the ''fish out of water'' aspects of the series.
 Mr. Jacobson traces the genesis of the commercial to ''an early idea to name the show 'High on a Hill,' which gets that show tune, 'Sound of Music' notion in your head.''
 Then, in a segment of one episode that Mr. Jacobson recalls watching as he was thinking about the campaign, the Beekman Boys ''break into song,'' he says, ''so when we called and asked, 'Would you be interested in doing a Busby Berkeley send-up?' They were game.''
 Mr. Ridge, in a joint interview with Mr. Kilmer-Purcell, says he believes the spot ''does exactly what it needs to do.''
 ''There are a lot of shows on the air and lots of cable channels,'' Mr. Ridge says, ''and they need to get people's attention.''
 ''People will see that and they'll remember the tune, which is very catchy,'' he adds, ''and when they see the clips, they'll go, 'That's those guys.' ''
 Mr. Ridge and Mr. Kilmer-Purcell say they are indeed singing in the commercial. It took ''one day to record the music, one day rehearsing the choreography and two days of shooting,'' Mr. Kilmer-Purcell says.
 ''I'm used to being on the other end of the camera,'' says Mr. Kilmer-Purcell, who works as a creative director at JWT in New York, part of WPP. ''I'm used to standing over in crafts services and watching on the playback.''
 Mr. Ridge, a gerontologist, at least had the benefit of his experience on television, having appeared regularly on Martha Stewart's show when he worked at her company, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia.
 ''But the work I've done in TV before was educational and informational,'' he says. ''It never involved singing and dancing.''
 His only wish in taking part, he adds, laughing, was that the performance turn out good enough to be usable as an audition clip for ''Dancing With the Stars.''
 As for how much the pair is involved in the campaign, there is a surprise. 
 As someone who works in advertising, Mr. Kilmer-Purcell would be expected to want to get his hands dirty, so to speak.
 But, he says, ''I tried to be empathetic and let them do their jobs,'' referring to Planet Green and the Los Angeles production company, called Roger, that directed and produced the commercial.
 Mr. Ridge, however, is not shy about offering input, a fact confirmed by Mr. Jacobson.
 ''What's great about Josh being in advertising is that he knows when the client's being too pushy,'' Mr. Jacobson says, ''and says, 'I'm going to let you do what you do.' ''
 ''Brent is the opposite,'' Mr. Jacobson says. ''Brent sends 10 ideas a day.''
 Mr. Ridge agrees that he has ''no qualms about presenting my opinion'' because, he says, the campaign, and the series, are ''ultimately a reflection on me and us and our company.''
 That reference is to Beekman 1802, the company the couple started to sell products from the farm like goat milk cheese and goat milk soap. The company operates a store in Sharon Springs and can also be found on a Web site, beekman1802.com, where there is e-commerce, blogs, a place to sign up for an e-mail newsletter and promotions for ''The Fabulous Beekman Boys'' as well as for the memoir, which was written by Mr. Kilmer-Purcell.
 The book, called ''The Bucolic Plague: How Two Manhattanites Became Gentlemen Farmers'' (Harper), is, serendipitously, coming out at the same time as the TV series. A page in the back of the book serves as an ad for the show.
 The show is also promoted at events for the memoir like readings in bookstores and on the pages of Web sites like amazon.com and bn.com where the book is being sold. 
 And the book is being promoted at events for the show sponsored by Planet Green, like a party on June 2 at the new ABC Kitchen restaurant that is part of the ABC Carpet and Home store in Manhattan. At that party, guests were even served treats made with the goat cheese from the farm.
 Marketing has come a long way from the days when a hot promotional idea was a cookie jar shaped like a barn that played the ''Green Acres'' theme song.
 ''The Fabulous Beekman Boys'' is a cornerstone of plans by Planet Green to broaden the content of its programming beyond strictly environmental themes. 
 It is part of a prime-time block of shows known as Verge, which, Ms. Michalchyshyn says, is being devoted to ''conscious living,'' that is, ''a mindset about living a different, positive life.''
 The hope is that the new strategy will help Planet Green increase its viewership as it prepares to have its ratings measured, beginning in the fourth quarter.

HEADLINE: Criticism Flowing Like Oil, but Obama's Rating Is Steady

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
Oil has gushed into the Gulf of Mexico for eight weeks now - and sent a bipartisan wave of criticism crashing into the White House.
 Allies and adversaries have accused President Obama of reacting too slowly, deferring too much to BP, displaying too little emotion and demonstrating incompetent management. Fans of historical analogy compare his performance to ineffectual responses by President Jimmy Carter during the Iran hostage crisis, and President George W. Bush during Hurricane Katrina.
In other words, the crisis in the gulf has become a first-class political crisis, too. 
 Right?
 Maybe not - or at least, not so far.
 Polls show that American voters give Mr. Obama the same mixed evaluation as before the spill. They like him personally but have reservations about his policies. Roughly half approve of his performance in the Oval Office, about where the president has remained since last fall, after his initial honeymoon with Americans faded.
 ''It's hard to make the case that the BP oil spill has a substantial impact on Obama's job approval,'' said Bill McInturff, a Republican pollster.
 Charles Franklin, an analyst for pollster.com, has tried to make it. Mr. Franklin examined polls that run ''hot'' for Mr. Obama, like the Washington Post/ABC News survey that recently measured a 52 percent job approval rating.
 He parsed polls that run colder, like Rasmussen Reports, whose automated phone survey recorded 47 percent approval over the weekend. Neither has moved significantly since the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded on April 20.
 Gallup's daily ''tracking'' has shown a slight decline. But after examining the surveys used in the tracking, and finding scant movement in other polls, Mr. Franklin isn't convinced of genuine deterioration beyond routine survey-to-survey ''noise.''
 ''I see current approval about in line with the fluctuations we've seen all year for each pollster,'' said Mr. Franklin, a political scientist at the University of Wisconsin. ''Little evidence of real change.''
 Keeping Close Tabs
 Presidential job approval is the most-watched statistic in American politics, a proxy for the chief executive's power to persuade lawmakers, capacity to win re-election and ability to help or hurt in midterm elections.
 It rarely moves rapidly. Because Americans know so much about presidents already, new information must be extraordinarily powerful to change impressions.
 National security crises can do it when the public rallies around the president. After 9/11, Mr. Bush's approval rating quickly jumped to the 80s from the 50s.
 Political fiascos can have the opposite effect, if not as dramatically. By mid-2005, setbacks in Iraq, a star-crossed effort to overhaul Social Security and the right-to-die controversy involving Terri Schiavo were sapping Mr. Bush's strength.
 When Hurricane Katrina hit, Mr. Franklin calculated, Mr. Bush's approval rating was already dropping by one percentage point a month. The rate of decline doubled in the wake of Katrina's televised images of human suffering.
 Fortunately for Mr. Obama, the BP spill hasn't produced comparable images. Also shielding him is the presence of BP, a corporate giant in an unpopular industry, as a lightning rod.
 A third factor is the administration's effort to publicize its attempts to respond and hold BP accountable. That effort will include another trip to the gulf on Monday and a presidential address on Tuesday night.
 ''His standing with the American people is not being negatively affected,'' said Joel Benenson, a pollster for Mr. Obama, because ''they overwhelmingly see the president making this his top priority.''Subtler Damage?
 Mr. Obama may be sustaining damage in subtler ways. Gallup's slight decline could prove the leading edge of a trend that shows up later in other surveys.
 The spill could also increase White House vulnerability to future setbacks. Mr. McInturff noted that Katrina, by eroding Mr. Bush's reputation for competence, had deeper long-term ramifications for his presidency than were apparent in the fall of 2005.
 Moreover, attention to the spill has cost the administration opportunities to communicate on what Democrats want to be their 2010 centerpiece: recovery from the Great Recession.
 The spill ''adds to the burdens he carries,'' said Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew Research Center. ''But none of it is as central to judgments about him as the economy and unemployment.''
 Indeed, the stickiness of Mr. Obama's standing cuts both ways. If BP has not eroded it, the administration's signal achievement - passage of health care legislation - has not enhanced it much, either, as joblessness hovers near 10 percent.
 And one thing Democratic strategists agree on: they need Mr. Obama's approval rating to move higher to ease their Election Day pain.
 Earlier this month, as Mr. Obama visited the gulf, the Labor Department reported that just 41,000 new private sector jobs had been created in May, down from more than 200,000 in April. That flow rate is likely to prove most critical to the president and his party this fall.
 This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: The Larger Struggle

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
These days we are transfixed by the struggle between BP and the U.S. government. This is a familiar conflict -- between a multinational company trying to make a profit and the government trying to regulate the company and hold it accountable.
 But this conflict is really a family squabble. It takes place amid a much larger conflict, and in this larger conflict both BP and the U.S. government are on the same team. 
 The larger conflict began with the end of the cold war. That ideological dispute settled the argument over whether capitalism was the best economic system. But it did not settle the argument over whether democratic capitalism was the best political-social-economic system. Instead, it left the world divided into two general camps.
 On the one side are those who believe in democratic capitalism -- ranging from the United States to Denmark to Japan. People in this camp generally believe that businesses are there to create wealth and raise living standards while governments are there to regulate when necessary and enforce a level playing field. Both government officials like President Obama and the private sector workers like the BP executives fall neatly into this camp.
 On the other side are those that reject democratic capitalism, believing it leads to chaos, bubbles, exploitations and crashes. Instead, they embrace state capitalism. People in this camp run Russia, China, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Venezuela and many other countries.
 Many scholars have begun to analyze state capitalism. One of the clearest and most comprehensive treatments is ''The End of the Free Market'' by Ian Bremmer.
 Bremmer points out that under state capitalism, authoritarian governments use markets ''to create wealth that can be directed as political officials see fit.'' The ultimate motive, he continues, ''is not economic (maximizing growth) but political (maximizing the state's power and the leadership's chances of survival).'' Under state capitalism, market enterprises exist to earn money to finance the ruling class.
 The contrast is clearest in the energy sector. In the democratic capitalist world we have oil companies, like Exxon Mobil, BP and Royal Dutch Shell, that make money for shareholders.
 In the state capitalist world there are government-run enterprises like Gazprom, Petrobras, Saudi Aramco, Petronas, Petroleos de Venezuela, China National Petroleum Corporation and the National Iranian Oil Company. These companies create wealth for the political cliques, and they, in turn, have the power of the state behind them.
 With this advantage, state energy companies have been absolutely crushing the private-sector energy companies. In America, we use the phrase Big Oil to describe Exxon Mobil, BP, Royal Dutch Shell and others. But that just shows how parochial we are. In fact, none of these private companies make it on a list of the world's top 13 energy companies. A generation ago, the biggest multinationals produced well more than half of the world's oil and gas. But now, according to Bremmer, they produce just 10 percent of the world's oil and gas and hold only about 3 percent of the world's reserves.
 The rivalry between democratic capitalism and state capitalism is not like the rivalry between capitalism and communism. It is an interdependent rivalry. State capitalist enterprises invest heavily in democratic capitalist enterprises (but they tend not to invest in each other). Both sides rely on each other in interlocking trade networks.
 Nonetheless, there is rivalry. There is a rivalry over prestige. What system works better to produce security and growth? What system should emerging and struggling democratic nations aim for? There is also rivalry over what rules should govern the world order. Should countries like Russia be able to withhold gas from Western Europe to make a political point? Should governments be able to tilt the playing field to benefit well-connected national champions? Should authoritarian governments like Iran be allowed to nuclearize?
 We in the democratic world tend to assume state capitalism can't prosper forever. Innovative companies can't thrive unless there's also a free exchange of ideas. A high-tech economy requires more creative destruction than an authoritarian government can tolerate. Cronyism will inevitably undermine efficiency.
 That's all true. But state capitalism may be the only viable system in low-trust societies, in places where decentralized power devolves into gangsterism. Moreover, democratic regimes have shown their vulnerabilities of late: a tendency to make unaffordable promises to the elderly and other politically powerful groups; a tendency toward polarization, which immobilizes governments even in the face of devastating problems.
 We in the democratic world have no right to be sanguine. State capitalism taps into deep nationalist passions and offers psychic security for people who detest the hurly-burly of modern capitalism. So I hope that as they squabble, Obama and BP keep at least one eye on the larger picture.
 We need healthy private energy companies. We also need to gradually move away from oil and gas -- the products that have financed the rise of aggressive state capitalism.

HEADLINE: Plea to Buy Is Hard Sell In Germany

BYLINE: By JACK EWING

 BODY:
FRANKFURT -- Germany's trading partners want the country to go on a shopping spree, increase imports and help countries like Greece and Spain grow faster so they can pay off their debts. But a look at recent history suggests that it might be a bad idea to rely on German consumers for a European recovery.
 Consumer spending has been in decline in Germany since well before the crisis hit, and the country has been a quagmire for retailers over the last decade. Gap, Marks & Spencer and even Wal-Mart tried and failed to establish profitable operations in the country.
 ''The German consumer didn't join in the spending party when times were good and they are even more reluctant to join in now,'' said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, a data provider that surveys sentiment in the retailing industry. 
 Retail sales in Germany have been on a downward trend since late 2006, well before anyone worried about Greek bond spreads. While store sales in April were up a modest 1 percent from March, they were still down 3.1 percent from a year earlier.
 Germans tend to be stereotyped as a country of skinflints who always seem to be girding themselves for the next crisis. There may be something to that; the French and British have continued to spend through most of the financial crisis. Europewide, consumer spending started to decline only last year.
 According to European Union figures, in recent years Germany has had the fastest-growing population of residents older than 65, a demographic that is less likely to buy big-ticket items like furniture. Germans also traditionally save more than their neighbors and export more products than they import. 
 The United States Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, and the French finance minister, Christine Lagarde, are among leaders who have recently urged the German government to take steps to persuade its residents to spend some of their savings on imports and not reach too far in cutting the country's budget.
 ''Fiscal consolidation should be 'growth friendly,' '' Mr. Geithner said at a Group of 20 conference in Busan, South Korea, this month. The statement did not prevent Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany from introducing a plan two days later to cut 85 billion euros ($104 billion) in spending by 2014.
 Mr. Geithner's comments reflect a larger debate about how Europe should respond to its sovereign debt crisis. While some political leaders and economists fear that austerity programs could undercut growth, others insist that even countries without dire budget problems should cut outlays. They argue that Germans and other Europeans will return to the shopping malls only when they believe their Continent is not headed toward fiscal ruin.
 ''The debt crisis has certainly created insecurity,'' said Rolf Burkl, who surveys consumer sentiment for the market research company GfK Group. ''There is a fear that political leaders no longer have the situation under control.''
 The demographic and economic trends that have brought misery to German retailers are in full view in Hanau, a working-class community east of Frankfurt. On a warm day recently, an elderly man slowly pushed a walker past the windows of what used to be a Karstadt department store that filled half a block in Hanau's pedestrian zone. Karstadt, once the largest department store chain in Germany, has been closing its least profitable outlets as it tries to emerge from bankruptcy.
 Denuded of logos and swept clean inside, the only color on the store's gray facade was a poster advertising a concert by Unk, a rapper from the United States.
 Next door, a store called Billig Kaufhaus, or Cheap Department Store, had taken over space once occupied by a sporting goods chain. Billig Kaufhaus offered an eclectic selection of goods, from luggage and World Cup souvenirs to decorative wooden statues of cats.
 Nearby stores did not exactly fit with the upscale image that Karstadt had tried to portray. They included a secondhand clothing store and a manicure salon with a sideline in sexy lingerie.
 ''There's nothing happening. People don't know where to go,'' said one passerby, Margrit Jugel of Hanau.
 Lowering her voice as if confiding a secret, Ms. Jugel mentioned another German department store chain still operating a few blocks away. ''I hear they're not doing so well either,'' she said.
 Even if German leaders were inclined to try to stimulate spending, it is questionable whether tax cuts or other government encouragement would do much for shops in places like Hanau, economists say. German wages have been stagnant for years, and the aging population is focused on saving for retirement.
 In fact, a tax cut could even backfire by heightening fears that the government will not have enough money to pay pensions. ''They say, 'What's going to happen when I'm 90? I have to start saving now,' '' said Francesco Giavazzi, a professor of economics at Bocconi University in Milan who has studied the German response to pension overhauls.
 That argument is endorsed by central bankers, who say austerity measures will raise confidence by reassuring Europeans that government finances are sound. ''The view that fiscal consolidation is generally negative for growth is too narrow,'' Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the European Central Bank, said Thursday in Vienna. 
 Germany also takes heat for its trade surplus, which is by far the largest in Europe. But no one has yet come up with a formula to bring its imports more closely in line with exports.
 ''You can't reduce the surplus by reducing exports, that would be nonsense,'' said Christian Dreger, an economist at the German Institute for Economic Research in Berlin. He said Germany should increase demand by making it easier to start businesses and by reducing barriers to competition, like standardized fees for tax advisers and other professionals.
 The German government already tried direct stimulus last year, cutting payroll deductions and raising the allowance parents receive for each child.
 ''That is already a clear impulse. That raises disposable income,'' said Simon Junker, an economist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt. ''But the Germans save the money and that cancels out the effect.''
 A cash-for-clunkers program helped German auto sales surge last year. But new registrations plunged 25.5 percent in the first four months of 2010 after the incentives expired.
 ''It's a question of creating the conditions for growth,'' Mr. Dreger said. ''Consumer giveaways or scrappage schemes are a flash in the pan.''
 The most important factor in consumer confidence is people's assessment of future employment prospects, said Mr. Burkl, the market researcher. GfK calculates that for every person who loses a job, three friends or family members become more cautious about spending out of fear they will be next.
 German joblessness has risen during the financial crisis, but less than in the United States because of programs that let companies cut working hours, with the government reimbursing part of the lost income.
 The government may be on the right track with such programs, Mr. Burkl suggested. ''Ultimately the best thing for consumption would be better prospects for jobs, because it raises income and also expectations,'' he said. 
 For Mr. Williamson, the economist at Markit, ''It's a case of persuading the population that we're over the worst.''

HEADLINE: Efforts to Repel Gulf Spill Are Described as Chaotic

BYLINE: By CAMPBELL ROBERTSON; William Yardley contributed reporting from Seattle and John Collins Rudolf from Grand Isle, La.

 BODY:
GRAND ISLE, La. -- Deano Bonano, the emergency preparedness director for Jefferson Parish, marched from a motor home being used as a command center to an office across the street filled with BP officials.
 It was late May. Oil had been creeping into the passes around Grand Isle. Two fleets of fishing boats were supposed to be laying out boom, the long floating barriers to corral oil and protect the fragile marshes of Barataria Bay.
 But the boats were gathered on the inland side of the bay -- the wrong side -- anchored idly as the oil oozed in from the Gulf of Mexico. BP officials said they had no way of contacting the workers on the boats, Mr. Bonano recalled.
 ''You're watching the oil come in,'' Mr. Bonano said, ''and they can't even move.'' 
 For much of the last two months, the focus of the response to the Deepwater Horizon explosion has been a mile underwater, 50 miles from shore, where successive efforts involving containment domes, ''top kills'' and ''junk shots'' have failed, and a ''spillcam'' shows tens of thousands of barrels of oil hemorrhaging into the gulf each day. 
 Closer to shore, the efforts to keep the oil away from land have not fared much better, despite a response effort involving thousands of boats, tens of thousands of workers and millions of feet of containment boom. 
 From the beginning, the effort has been bedeviled by a lack of preparation, organization, urgency and clear lines of authority among federal, state and local officials, as well as BP. As a result, officials and experts say, the damage to the coastline and wildlife has been worse than it might have been if the response had been faster and orchestrated more effectively.
 ''The present system is not working,'' Senator Bill Nelson of Florida said Thursday at a hearing in Washington devoted to assessing the spill and the response. Oil had just entered Florida waters, Senator Nelson said, adding that no one was notified at either the state or local level, a failure of communication that echoed Mr. Bonano's story and countless others along the Gulf Coast.
 ''The information is not flowing,'' Senator Nelson said. ''The decisions are not timely. The resources are not produced. And as a result, you have a big mess, with no command and control.''
 They were supposed to be better prepared. When the Exxon Valdez ran aground in Alaska in 1989, skimmers, booms and dispersants were in short supply for the response, which was led by a consortium of oil companies in which BP was the majority stakeholder. 
 A year later, lawmakers passed the federal Oil Pollution Act to ensure that plans were in place for oil spills, so the response effort would be quick, with clear responsibilities for everyone involved. 
 Every region of the country was required to have a contingency plan, tailored for its unique geography, for responding to a spill. 
 But Leslie Pearson, a private oil-spill response consultant, said federal oversight of spill contingency plans largely amounts to accepting what oil industry operators say they can do, rather than demanding they demonstrate that they can actually do it. 
 ''Their plans don't say, 'Within X amount of time it has to be controlled and industry needs to prove how the heck you're going to do that,' '' she said.
 She and other critics of the federal government's response point to parts of the world where they say foreign governments have stricter rules for offshore operators. In the Canadian Arctic, for example, some offshore operators are required to have ships on close standby to drill relief wells more quickly than the ones being drilled in the gulf. 
 While the United States requires operators to be prepared to drill relief wells, their contingency plans do not have to specify a firm timeline for how quickly they will do so, experts said.
 Some states have tried to establish tougher rules within their jurisdictions. In Prince William Sound, where the Valdez ran aground, for example, Alaska requires all tankers to be accompanied by two escort vessels. Enough equipment also has to be at the ready to remove up to 300,000 barrels of oil in 72 hours.
 Scott Schaefer, the deputy administrator of California's Office of Spill Prevention and Response, said his state's regulations also went beyond federal law, requiring, among other things, repeated tests of response equipment. 
 Mr. Schaefer, who is now in Mobile, Ala., working to fight the oil spill there, declined to characterize the level of preparation in the gulf. He did note, though, that many other experts had flown in from California, including scientists trained in gauging damage to sensitive areas and experts in aerial imaging to study the density of oil in the water. 
 ''They've got their programs here and they're pretty proud of them,'' he said. ''I think on the West Coast it's just much bigger and better funded.''
 Still, said Ms. Pearson, the consultant, states have limited tools to deal with offshore drilling in federal waters, as was the case with the Deepwater Horizon. 
 And by the time oil arrives at a coastline, she said, ''you've lost the response.''
 Many experts also said that no plan could really fight this leak perfectly, and that the problem was more with the regulations that allowed it to happen in the first place.
 ''I don't think there's a person in the spill world who would have thought that whole thing would be contained and recovered,'' said Elise DeCola, a response consultant based in Massachusetts. ''Whether or not you decide to drill is a policy decision, a calculated risk. Everyone at the end of the day understands that risk. It's kind of damage control from the start.''
 Beyond the Worst Case
 There were at least five plans governing the response to this spill, including national and regional plans drawn up by the Coast Guard and federal and state authorities, as well as lengthy plans prepared by BP. Each one either failed to consider a continuing blowout or drastically underplayed the effects of one.
 ''I will tell you that nobody in their plan foresaw this incident,'' said Capt. Roger Laferriere of the Coast Guard, who is directing cleanup efforts in Houma, La. ''Nobody.'' 
 The contingency plan for southeast Louisiana, which was drawn up by a committee led by the Coast Guard and a state representative, specifically mentions the possibility of a blowout and includes a worst case of a million-barrel spill, which is significantly short of even conservative estimates of the current spill. 
 But like other federal plans, it does not anticipate the possibility that the leak could continue for weeks. It concludes, for example, that such a spill would require the use of 38,400 gallons of dispersant, or roughly 3 percent of what has been applied in the last two months.
 The BP plans do consider an uncontrolled blowout, one that releases 240,000 barrels a day into the gulf for at least 100 days -- far worse than the current spill. 
 In the event of such an enormous spill, according to these plans, ''no significant adverse impacts are expected'' to beaches, wetlands or coast-dwelling birds. 
 Toby Odone, a BP spokesman, said in an e-mail message that the company's oil spill response plan was ''fully approved'' by the Minerals Management Service.
 ''The plan does not, and cannot, prevent an oil spill or any impact from the spill, but it establishes the framework under which the company will respond,'' he wrote. ''This is the framework we and the unified command have been using in what is the largest oil spill response in US history.''
 Adm. Thad W. Allen of the Coast Guard, the national commander for the spill, said in an interview that shortcomings in the response did not stem from the actions described in the plans, but from the risk assessment on which those plans were based.
 ''I think they're adequate to the assumptions in the plans,'' Admiral Allen said. ''I think you need to go back and question the assumptions.''
 Admiral Allen said that in the future, the Coast Guard would probably need to review the oil company contingency plans -- which are approved by the Minerals Management Service and not the Coast Guard -- ''for the purpose of executability'' in a response. But mostly, he said, everyone would need to re-examine the worst-case scenarios. 
 The potential spills contemplated in the plans drawn up by federal authorities are monolithic slicks. The spill in the gulf, Admiral Allen said, is a series of large spills spreading in every direction from Louisiana to Florida, underwater and on the surface. 
 This creates a different situation entirely.
 ''The Coast Guard will need to take a look at this new scenario, and how we are going to address this happening in the future,'' Captain Laferriere said. ''This is the new, defining worst-case scenario.'' 
 The reason for the inclusion of worst-case scenarios in these plans is for officials to ensure that enough supplies, like boom and oil skimmers, are on hand to respond to a spill.
 Now critical boom is being flown in from the north shore of Alaska and oil skimming boats are coming from as far away as Norway. Requirements for more so-called mechanical response equipment, as opposed to chemical dispersant, fell short of current needs.
 A 1999 Coast Guard report recommended that a mechanical response -- using equipment like boom, skimmers and absorbent materials largely marshaled by boat and from land -- should be increased by as much as 25 percent. 
 But over the next several years, lobbyists for oil companies pushed to keep the existing standard in place and emphasized the use of chemical dispersant.
 Fred Felleman, an environmental consultant based in Seattle who has worked to strengthen spill prevention and response efforts in Northwest ports, said the oil industry's preference for dispersants was driven in part by economics.
 ''It's very expensive to have people on the ground trained and ready to deploy, under contract,'' Mr. Felleman said.
 In rules formally published last August, the Coast Guard effectively overruled its 1999 report, declining to require the substantial increase in the amount of mechanical response equipment.
 However, in comments published along with the rules, the Coast Guard said that it ''recognizes that the amount of mechanical recovery equipment is still inadequate to address the worst-case threat.''
 There is no excuse for the failure in the plans to anticipate the situation now unfolding, said Mark Davis, director of the Tulane Institute on Water Resources Law and Policy and a longtime advocate for the protection of Louisiana wetlands. 
 He pointed out that it has been more than 30 years since the catastrophic Ixtoc I blowout in Mexico in 1979, which lasted for 10 months and released 3.7 million barrels of oil. 
 But, Mr. Davis acknowledged, hindsight will not help with the operation in the gulf.
 ''You pull the ripcord on the parachute you packed,'' he said. ''Not the parachute you wish you had packed.'' 
 Unclear Leadership
 At the very least, these plans, which devote pages and flow charts to command structure, were meant to have an efficient hierarchy in place as soon as a spill occurred. That structure has often been unwieldy, and to some, hardly evident at all.
 ''I still don't know who's in charge,'' Billy Nungesser, the president of Plaquemines Parish, said at the Senate hearing on Thursday, seven weeks after the Deepwater Horizon rig sank. ''Is it BP? Is it the Coast Guard?''
 Governance is inherently complicated by the players who are thrown together: BP officials work alongside federal officials who rebuke them publicly, and federal officials work closely with officials at the state level, who have been equally public in their condemnation of the response.
 Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, for example, has drawn local support for his fact-filled critiques of the response plans, but every 48 hours a state representative cooperates on those same plans with BP and the Coast Guard.
 ''I told him, when he signs the plan he's endorsing our projects,'' said Captain Laferriere, adding that he and the representative sit in the same office. ''Louisiana is still learning the process.''
 But Garret Graves, the governor's senior coastal adviser, said that the state's power was limited: the state strongly disapproves of the amount of chemical dispersant being used, he said, and feels that the supply of boom is drastically inadequate.
 The main problems, many here say, have been sluggish response times and a consistent impression that no one is in charge. 
 Reports of oil reaching shore have been made days before any vessels were seen in the area. After squalls, booms have ended up tangled like spaghetti on the shores of wildlife-rich islands, only to remain like that for days with no response workers in sight.
 ''We are making adjustments every day to improve our efforts,'' Mr. Odone of BP wrote. ''For example, we initially struggled with the logistics of getting crews to work, but have made major improvement since to make sure this happens.''
 Requests to the response operation, no matter how small, have required approval, a process that state and local officials said could take days or weeks. Some requests were never answered at all.
 ''You would throw it into the dark black hole and it might not ever come back,'' Ralph Mitchell, the public safety director for Terrebonne Parish, said of early requests for boom.
 On the other hand, the flurry of planning on the parish and state levels meant just that: more plans, more officials and more chains of command in an effort that was already sprawling. Parish officials have taken helicopters to observe coastline shortly after Coast Guard or BP officials did, duplicating efforts out of distrust.
 Admiral Allen, echoing Mr. Nungesser, said that he had had to learn the lines of authority within Louisiana, and that in recent weeks, he had adapted the centralized command structure to the ''home rule economy'' of the parishes.
 More decision-making authority has been given to Coast Guard officers at the local level, a move that has been broadly welcomed here after weeks of growing frustration.
 ''The effectiveness of the effort came way late,'' said Forrest A. Travirca III, a field inspector for a local land trust that includes the nine-mile beachfront at Port Fourchon, La., and 35,000 acres of marshland behind it. 
 Until recently, Mr. Travirca said, ''there was no direction. It was just chaotic. There was this group doing something, that group doing something. Nobody knowing who was doing what.''
 Crews on the Ground
 BP's growing cleanup operation, which includes more than 100 companies and has already cost $1.6 billion, has left an often dangerous vacuum of guidance and direction in one of the most fragile ecosystems on earth.
 Cleanup workers on Queen Bess Island, La., have been spotted trampling pelican nesting grounds and tossing around pelican eggs. 
 Yellow caution tape has been strung up on beaches to keep the news media and civilians out, only to end up in the marsh, where it could harm birds and small mammals. 
 On the beach at Port Fourchon, Mr. Travirca said, cleanup workers left oil-soaked mops on the beach for days, where the tides buried them in the sand. The workers were finally told to pick up the mops and put them in garbage bags, which they did -- but not before shaking the mops out and strewing the beach with oil again.
 While officials and residents of southern Louisiana have criticized a response that has sometimes been absent, they have also often criticized the cleanup crews that do show up.
 ''BP could fire all their contractors because they're doing absolutely nothing but destroying our marsh,'' Mr. Nungesser told the Senate panel. 
 David Camardelle, the mayor of Grand Isle and others complained that the employees in BP's sprawling response are often outsiders who are not familiar with the fragile marshes and not local fishermen who most need the jobs.
 Typically, spill cleanup workers are men and women who are found by temporary staffing agencies in unemployment lines and through classified ads, often with little education and few job prospects. They receive training and then wait to be called into action when an accident occurs. 
 These staffing agencies have contracts with environmental cleanup firms, which in turn have contracts with another company, in most cases the responsible party. But this spill operation is different from others because of the sheer number of contractors involved, making it difficult not only for officials demanding accountability but for the contractors themselves. 
 The agencies, some of them quite small, are paying out hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not more, in wages, but in many cases have not been able to reach through layers upon layers of contractors to the ultimate paymaster, BP. 
 Several expressed concern that if the labor needs increased with the scale of the cleanup and they still did not have guarantees from BP, they may have to pull out.
 ''There's way too many players in it,'' said an owner of one of the staffing agencies involved, who did not want to publicly criticize the process. ''You don't know who's getting money from where.''
 For now, the problem is not that people are working without pay, but the opposite. Trained workers are brought in by the hundreds to an area so that they will be in place if work needs to be done. In some of these areas, there is no work to be done. But under the contract, they need to be paid anyway.
 ''Our people aren't out on the beach,'' the owner of another agency said, lamenting the lack of organization. ''They're sitting under a tree and getting paid a full day.''
 The cleanup operation has also been, at times, a casualty of politics. One staffing agency sent more than 150 trained workers to the Gulf Coast only to be told that in light of local and state insistence on exclusively local employment, too many of the workers were from out of state. They were all let go the next day. 
 A Barrier's Limits
 One of the most vivid images in news reports on the oil spill has been boom, the lengths of orange and yellow barrier that are anchored to the seafloor and either keep oil at bay or corral it so it can be skimmed. From the earliest days, politicians have been demanding it, officials have been promising more of it and now nearly 400 miles of it is in place in gulf waters. 
 But it has also become a potent symbol of the problems with the response effort.
 Boom, which is easily swamped by waves, provides only limited protection, something even politicians who have thundered for more to be installed will concede. It also requires constant maintenance, as squalls moving in from offshore regularly break the chains apart, and effective deployment, something officials at all levels say has been lacking.
 ''The boom has been a disaster from the beginning,'' Mr. Nungesser said, citing improper training for workers laying it out, as well as their unfamiliarity with the area's waterways. 
 But proper deployment also requires a thorough plan and a detailed map of effective locations, with precise measurements of passes and other waterways.
 The southeast Louisiana contingency plan, which includes environmental sensitivity maps, had not been updated in seven years -- a lifetime after intense coastal erosion and a series of hurricanes that have turned, by some estimates, nearly 500 square miles of wetlands into open water.
 So after the spill, with no new plan forthcoming, state and parish officials gathered one Saturday night in an office tower in Baton Rouge, and drew up a new set of booming maps.
 Such plans work best when they can be tested ahead of time. They also are dependent on certain kinds of boom. 
 But response crews have often had to make do with the kind of boom that was on hand, even when it was the wrong kind. And since everything was being concocted on the fly, ''they hadn't had a chance to validate the plan,'' Captain Laferriere said.
 ''I'd fly out every day and notice the boom,'' he said. ''And it was failing.''

HEADLINE: Legislation Won't Close Gender Gap in Sciences

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY

 BODY:
If the Senate passes legislation establishing regular ''workshops to enhance gender equity'' in academic science, what exactly would scientists and engineers do at them? The legislation, already approved by the House, is a little vague beyond directing researchers and heads of academic departments to participate in ''activities that increase the awareness of the existence of gender bias.'' 
 But let me venture one prediction: There will be lots of talk about the male chauvinists on the Swedish Medical Research Council who awarded 20 postdoctoral fellowships in 1994.
 The analysis of those fellowships, published in Nature in 1997, is the fundamental text of the gender-bias movement, cited over and over at conferences, in papers and in lobbying materials. If you're looking for evidence of discrimination against female scientists, this article seems to be the one clear, unambiguously scandalous finding. 
 The article was written by Christine Wenneras and Agnes Wold, two of the unsuccessful applicants for those Swedish postdoctoral fellowships. After learning that male applicants were much more likely than female applicants to succeed, they sued to get the data behind the decisions and then analyzed the 114 applicants' publication records. They concluded that a woman had to be two and a half times as productive as a man to receive the same rating of competence. 
 The shocking findings made headlines, but how representative was that one Swedish study of 114 applicants? At that time, female applicants to the National Science Foundation were succeeding just as often as men were, and much larger studies since then have repeatedly failed to find gender bias. 
 When two Swedish researchers, Ulf Sandstrom and Martin Hallsten, did a follow-up study analyzing the Swedish medical fellowships awarded in 2004, they found that female applicants were actually rated more favorably than comparable male applicants. In 2005 a large study, conducted by the RAND Corporation, concluded that female applicants for research grants from federal agencies in the United States typically got as much money as male applicants.
 In 2008, an analysis of more than 2,000 grant proposals in Australia reported that female applicants did as well as males, and that applicants received similar ratings from both male and female reviewers. Last year two researchers, Herbert W. Marsh of Oxford and Lutz Bornmann of the University of Zurich, reported on an analysis of more than 350,000 grant proposals in eight countries. They found ''no effect of the applicant's gender on the peer review of their grant proposals.'' 
 Also last year a task force of the National Academy of Sciences concluded from its investigation of 500 science departments that by and large, men and women ''enjoyed comparable opportunities within the university.'' The task force reported that at major research universities, female candidates ''had a better chance of being interviewed and receiving offers than male job candidates had.''
 So why are women still such a minority in math-oriented sciences? The most balanced answer I've seen comes from two psychologists at Cornell, Stephen J. Ceci and Wendy M. Williams -- who, by the way, are married and have a daughter with a graduate degree in engineering. After reviewing hundreds of studies in their new book, ''The Mathematics of Sex'' (Oxford), they conclude that discrimination is no longer an important factor in keeping out women. 
 They find consistent evidence for biological differences in math aptitude, particularly in males' advantage in spatial ability and in their disproportionate presence at the extreme ends of the distribution curve on math tests (the topic of last week's column). But given all the progress made in math by girls, who now take more math and science classes than boys and get better grades, Dr. Ceci and Dr. Williams say that differences in aptitude are not the primary cause of the gender gap in academic science.
 Instead, they point to different personal preferences and choices of men and women, including the much-analyzed difference in the reaction to parenthood. When researchers at Vanderbilt University tracked the aspirations and values of mathematically gifted people in their 20s and 30s, they found a gender gap that widened after children arrived, with fathers focusing more on personal careers and mothers focusing more on the community and the family. 
 Dr. Ceci and Dr. Williams urge universities to make it easier for a young scientist to start a family and still compete for tenure, but they don't expect such reforms to eliminate the gender gap in academic science. After all, the difficulty of balancing family and career is hardly unique to science, and academia already offers parents more flexible working arrangements than do other industries with smaller gender gaps.
 The gap in science seems due mainly to another difference between the sexes: men are more interested in working with things, while women are more interested in working with people. There's ample evidence -- most recently in an analysis of surveys of more than 500,000 people -- that boys and men, on average, are more interested in inanimate objects and ''inorganic'' subjects like math and physics and engineering, while girls and women are more drawn to life sciences, social sciences and other ''organic'' careers that involve people and seem to have direct social usefulness. 
 You can argue how much of this difference is due to biology and how much to society, but could you really affect it by sending scientists and engineers off to the workshops mandated by the bill now in Congress? Christina Hoff Sommers, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and the editor of a recent book ''The Science on Women and Science'' (AEI Press), says the workshops' main effect would be to provide jobs for researchers and advocates promoting a myth of gender bias. 
 She criticizes the National Science Foundation for sustaining this industry over the past decade with more than $135 million from its Advance program promoting gender equity. 
 While some projects were worthwhile, Dr. Sommers says, the science grants were also used to stage ''The Vagina Monologues,'' develop a game called Gender Bias Bingo and present workshops featuring skits in which arrogant men mistreat female colleagues who are clearly their intellectual superiors. 
 Aided by the continuing federal grants, researchers and advocates have developed theories that women are being held back from pursuing careers in engineering and physics by ''stereotype threat,'' by ''implicit bias'' and by a shortage of female role models and mentors. Yet none of these theorized barriers prevented girls and women from dominating the fields that most interested them. 
 The life sciences and social sciences were once male bastions, yet today women make up a majority of working biological scientists, and they earn nearly three-quarters of the doctorates in psychology. Now that women are earning a majority of all undergraduate and graduate degrees, it's odd to assume they're the gender that needs special help on campus. If more women prefer to study psychology and medicine than physics and engineering, why is that a problem for Washington to fix? 
 I'd love to see more girls pursuing careers in science (and more women reading science columns), but I wish we'd encourage their individual aspirations instead of obsessing about group disparities. I can't see how we're helping them with scare stories about the awful discrimination they'll face. And I can't imagine that many scientists, male or female, are looking forward to being yanked out of the lab to play Gender Bias Bingo -- or hear once again about the Swedish chauvinists of 1994.
