HEADLINE: Fed Says City Leans Heavily On Income Tax

BYLINE: By MIKE McINTIRE

 BODY:
New York City's tax base has shifted over the last 30 years, leaving it increasingly dependent -- some say alarmingly so -- on income and corporate taxes, as well as vulnerable to the boom and bust fortunes of Wall Street, according to a study by the Federal Reserve.
 Other cities depend much more heavily on property taxes, which are typically more stable in generating revenue. The study found that while New York City relied more on property tax revenue decades ago, its tax burden has gradually shifted so that the portion of revenue derived from individual and corporate income taxes more than doubled, to about 34 percent, between 1970 and 2002.
 During the same period, the portion derived from property and sales revenues either decreased or remained stable, the study by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York shows. 
 The increased reliance on income taxes exacerbated the city's financial problems in recent years, the study found. During the economic recession that began in 2001 and ended last year, revenue from taxes on personal income declined 19 percent and business income 23 percent.
 ''The city has a specialized economy that depends pretty heavily on Wall Street, and Wall Street is pretty volatile,'' said Andrew F. Haughwout, an economist and one of the study's authors. ''So you have a pretty volatile revenue system built upon a pretty volatile economy.''
 The city's relatively low residential property taxes have been scorned in Albany and in surrounding suburbs, particularly when the city appeals for more state aid for needs like schools. 
 While other studies have suggested that the city could be getting more revenue from property, the Federal Reserve report breaks new ground in charting, over a period of decades, the gradual decline of the property tax's contribution to municipal coffers. The report's source makes it particularly noteworthy, since the Federal Reserve normally steers clear of politically charged, localized issues like New York tax policy. 
 The report comes amid a sharp debate between Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and the City Council over how best to cut property taxes, a move that could deepen what the study says is already an imbalance between income and property taxes. Published late last month with little fanfare, the study was not circulated widely beyond budget watchers and the financial press.
 ''We had delayed this report, trying to find a time when it was more calm,'' said Rae D. Rosen, a senior economist at the Federal Reserve. ''Political considerations are often short-term. We were trying to take a longer-term outlook.''
 Ms. Rosen said one of the reasons for the study was the coming expiration of the state Financial Emergency Act, which governs New York City finances. The act was adopted during the fiscal crisis of the 1970's, and its expiration, scheduled for 2008, offers a chance to change some provisions that govern city finances, like the $100 million cap on how much the city can set aside for economic downturns, she said.
 The study does not take a position on any particular remedy. It offers several options to mitigate the boom and bust cycle, including increasing property tax rates and using periodic tax windfalls to lower debt.
 The authors found that individual income and corporate taxes accounted for 15 percent of total taxes in 1970, and the remainder made up of property, sales and a variety of smaller taxes. By the late 1990's, income and corporate taxes made up 40 percent, even though rates had not increased significantly. 
 There are several reasons for the change, economists say. Income tax brackets are not adjusted for inflation, so that as incomes grow over time, more taxpayers are pushed into the higher brackets. In addition, the city's economy has grown since the 1970's, broadening the tax base.
 Although property taxes are still the largest source of revenue, they have declined as a portion of the total to 38 percent in 2002 from 51 percent in 1977, according to the city's Independent Budget Office, a nonpartisan fiscal monitor. Before raising the property tax rate 18.5 percent in late 2003, the City Council had effectively kept it frozen through much of the 1990's, and growth in property tax revenues has been kept in check by caps on how much the city can increase residential taxes. 
 Because property taxes are not as vulnerable to economic swings, they are generally considered a more stable source of income. The Federal Reserve report found that while individual income and corporate taxes were plunging during the last recession, property tax revenues actually rose 6 percent.
 Nevertheless, the Independent Budget Office reported in 2000 that as a percentage of its tax revenue, New York relied less on property taxes than any of the nation's nine other largest cities. 
 Experts differ on whether the city's balance of taxes is good or bad. George Sweeting, deputy director of the budget office, said one advantage to having a tax system sensitive to the Wall Street economy was that during boom times, revenue pours in and, if managed correctly, can be saved or used to lower debt.
 ''In some ways, it's good that we have a more diverse tax structure,'' Mr. Sweeting said. ''Having a variety of sources is not automatically a bad thing.''
 Edmund J. McMahon, an analyst with the Manhattan Institute, a conservative policy group, said the Federal Reserve's findings showed that the city must rethink its tax structure to prevent one segment of the tax base -- income tax revenue -- from having an inordinate effect. 
 ''Roughly a third of New York City's personal income taxes are paid by 13,000 millionaires, and when all those people have a bad year, the effect is multiplied,'' Mr. McMahon said. ''It isn't just that they don't buy a Lexus or tip the doorman. They don't pay as much in income taxes.''

HEADLINE: Summer Travel: The Waiting Game

BYLINE: By AMY GUNDERSON

 BODY:
SUMMER hasn't officially kicked off, but you would hardly know it by looking at the crowds. A warm California spring sent visitors flocking to Yosemite National Park. In Washington, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial has already clocked one million more visitors than at this time last year. Freedom Trail tours in Boston are up by 30 percent. And Las Vegas was bursting with visitors this March, with 98 percent of hotel rooms booked on the weekends. 
 Get ready to stand in line. After four years in a slump, the travel industry is gearing up to welcome back the crowds for what is predicted to be the busiest summer since 2000. A cold winter in the Northeast, pent up demand and an improved economy mean that airports, parks and just about everywhere else expect to be busy. ''It is going to be a crunched system,'' said Tom Parsons, the chief executive of BestFares .com, a discounter that monitors airline fares online. ''Airline advance sales are getting very close to 75 percent for June, July and August. That is just exceptional. And we still have 100 days to go.'' 
 Indeed, last summer, load factors -- the percentage of seats filled -- ran anywhere from 70 percent to 85 percent for four of the biggest carriers, American, United, Delta and Continental. And many airlines had record load factors for March and April of this year, even as they were increasing the number of flights. 
 Some travelers have already been hitting delays, especially at airports with more flights. (According to the federal Department of Transportation, a major cause of delays is air traffic control issues, including heavy volume.) On-time arrivals this spring at Los Angeles International, Newark Liberty International, Philadelphia International, San Francisco International and at La Guardia in New York have slipped as against the same time period last year. This March, according to the latest numbers from the Department of Transportation, just 62 percent of flights arrived on time at O'Hare International in Chicago, where the number of flights was up 6.6 percent. And it seems this could be just the beginning of delays, as well as bottlenecks at security checkpoints.
 ''There are going to be 6,000 fewer screeners this summer and millions more travelers,'' said Doug Wills, a spokesman for the Air Transport Association, an airline trade group based in Washington. Furthermore, it estimates that the number of air passengers this summer will be up 12 percent from last year, totaling 65 million people a month. The association, along with airports and the Transportation Security Administration, has compiled a list of 25 airports that are at risk for security delays this summer. Some of them, including Orlando International, Phoenix Sky Harbor International and McCarran International in Las Vegas, have been approved for additional screeners, but it is unclear if the new workers will be in place for the summer rush.
 Travelers to Las Vegas probably won't face the two-and-a-half-hour security lines that plagued McCarran this winter (the airport will be adding seven security lines by the end of June), but they should still allow for an hour to get through checkpoints. The exception: first-class passengers, who have separate security lines with waits of just 15 minutes during peak times.
 Dulles International in Washington will be undergoing several construction projects this summer, closing a runway and relocating one of its two security checkpoints. Throw in the planned June 16 launching of Independence Air, a new discount airline that could increase passenger traffic at Dulles by 50 percent, and things could get even more backed up. ''We are worried about this summer, when we get this huge increase in flights,'' said Tara Hamilton, a spokeswoman for the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority. ''Every major airline is going to see more people.'' 
 The high demand means there won't likely be big airfare sales this summer. At the same time, advance-purchase fares are already down 20 percent this year from last, according to Harrell Associates, a New York consulting firm, with the best deals on the increasingly competitive transcontinental routes. ''It is a great time to go out West,'' said Bob Harrell, the firm's president. The lower-fare carriers Southwest, JetBlue and America West are expanding their cross-country schedules this summer, making it easier than ever to find a cheap, nonstop flight. The results are striking, with fares from Washington to Los Angeles down 53 percent from last year and trips from Boston to Las Vegas 45 percent cheaper than a year ago. 
 Hotels across the country are also expecting a rebound this summer, with occupancy rates expected to hit 69.1 percent, their highest levels since 2000, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers's hospitality and leisure consulting group. According to PricewaterhouseCoopers's analysis, high-end chains like Westin, Ritz-Carlton and Marriott are likely to enjoy the biggest jump this summer. Hotels are taking the opportunity to raise prices slightly (the average cost of a night's stay is up 2 percent this year), but the biggest factor boosting travelers' bills will be the extras. ''There are things like mandatory housekeeping charges at more and more resorts,'' said Bjorn Hanson, a lodging analyst at PricewaterhouseCoopers. ''Hotels have spent the last year or two experimenting with which surcharges and fees get the least objections.''
 Think you can escape the crowds by visiting a national park? Good luck. Visits to national parks are up 5 percent so far this year. Most of the reserved camping spots at Yosemite are already taken, but half of the park's campsites are on a first-come-first-served basis. (You'll need to show up before 9 a.m. to get one, though, said Deb Schweizer, a ranger and the park's spokeswoman.) At Yellowstone in Wyoming, reservations at many of the campsites and hotels are available online, but Rick Hoeninghausen, the director of sales and marketing for Xanterra Parks and Resorts in Yellowstone, which handles the booking for 14 locations in the park, advises picking up the phone. ''You get the best availability by calling,'' said Mr. Hoeninghausen, who noted that this year on a midsummer weekend, there were 35 rooms available at the Old Faithful Inn. ''But the Web said it was sold out,'' he said. ''If you called, you could have a room.'' 
 Mr. Parsons of BestFares.com has even simpler advice for travelers trying to avoid the crowds and snag bargains. Wait until after Labor Day. ''In September and October,'' he said, ''it is a whole new ballgame.''

HEADLINE: 'Soul Plane'

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:

Directed by Jessy Terrero
R, 86 minutes
 You've never seen (and hopefully never boarded) an aircraft operated like the wobbly purple plane that bounces like a rubber toy on the way to takeoff in ''Soul Plane,'' which opens nationwide today. This hectic farce, which pushes every envelope, is so broad and relentlessly raunchy that it makes a spoof like ''Airplane'' seem as demure as a vintage drawing-room comedy.
 The movie, directed by Jessy Terrero from a screenplay by Bo Zenga and Chuck Wilson, depicts the raucous cross-country journey of flight No. 069 on NWA Airlines. The company was founded by Nashawn (Kevin Hart), an unemployed, self-described entrepreneur and his cousin Muggsy (Method Man) with $100 million that Nashawn won in a lawsuit against a carrier that lost his beloved pooch. NWA bills itself as the first full-service airline catering to the ''urban traveler.''
 Its maiden flight, from Los Angeles to New York, may be the wildest coast-to-coast party ever given in the air. Above the main cabin is a disco whose roof looks out on the stars. The dining ranges from fancy (Roederer Cristal Champagne, filet mignon and lobster, for first-class passengers) to atrocious (Colt 45 and greasy fried chicken, one piece to a customer) for everybody else stuck in ''low class.''
 One of those unfortunates is Elvis Hunkee (Tom Arnold), the divorced father of two rebellious children, who is traveling with his trashy girlfriend, Barbara (Missi Pyle). Smiling gamely with each humiliation, Elvis is the designated clueless white man in a movie that stretches every cliche of African-American sexuality way beyond caricature.
 Not everyone will be thrilled by the movie, which is one long dirty (and occasionally very funny) joke. ''Soul Plane'' gleefully flaunts every black pop culture stereotype that Spike Lee savaged in ''Bamboozled.'' For long stretches, it really is a flying minstrel show of studs, sluts and lustful stoned-out layabouts, ogling one another and making lewd remarks. In a typical joke, a blind man lasciviously fingers a baked potato and goes into paroxysms of ecstasy.
 Snoop Dogg, at his drollest, plays the pilot, Captain Mack, fresh out of prison, with his sneaky sideways smile and slit-eyed glances mocking everything in sight. But once the plane takes off, this coolest of clowns confesses that he's terrified of heights. When he passes out from an overdose of magic mushrooms belonging to his co-pilot, Gaeman (note the pun), the flight seems doomed. But never fear. In airplane disaster films and the movies that spoof them, the jet always lands safely.
 ''Soul Plane'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has strong language and sexual parody. STEPHEN HOLDEN

HEADLINE: National Briefing South: Virginia: Bond Rating Retained

BYLINE: By James Dao (NYT)

 BODY:
Moody's Investors Service said that the state would retain the highest general obligation bond rating, Aaa, thus removing the threat of a downgrade that could have cost Virginia millions of dollars in added interest fees. Moody's had placed Virginia on a downgrade watch list last fall because of the weak economy and projections of budget shortages for years to come. Gov. Mark Warner had cited the threat as a central argument for his plan to overhaul the state's tax system, which included raising taxes. The legislature enacted much of that proposal after a bitter budget debate last month. James Dao (NYT)

Economic Growth Revised Upward for First Quarter
The economy grew slightly faster than previously thought in the first quarter of this year, the Commerce Department reported, providing fresh evidence of momentum heading into the summer.
 Gross domestic product from January through March increased at a 4.4 percent annual rate, the department said. That was an improvement from both the 4.2 percent pace first estimated for the quarter a month ago and the 4.1 percent growth rate in the final quarter of 2003. [Page C5.]

A better-than-expected report on the gross domestic product helped send stocks higher. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 95.31 points, at 10,205.20. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 6.34 points, at 1,121.28, and the Nasdaq composite index gained 8.35 points, to 1,984.50. [C7.]

Fewer 'American Idol' Viewers
''American Idol,'' Fox's hit talent contest, finished its season Wednesday night with another impressive ratings performance, but the show's viewership significantly trailed that of last year's finale. The two-hour final night of ''Idol'' attracted 28.8 million viewers on Wednesday, making it one of the most-watched entertainment shows of the season. The winner was Fantasia Barrino, above.

Hollinger to Focus on Telegraph Sale
Hollinger International said that it would focus on selling just its Telegraph assets, and it has put a $1.1 billion floor on the bidding, according to people involved with the deal. [C4.]

Costco Earnings Increase 29%
Costco Wholesale posted a better-than-expected 29 percent jump in quarterly profit, thanks to strong spring sales and tighter cost controls. Analysts have long criticized Costco for failing to turn its sales performance into profit, but in the latest quarter, profits increased twice as fast as sales. Shares of Costco rose 63 cents, or 2 percent, to close at $38.07. [C2.]

U.S. and Bahrain Reach Trade Pact
The United States reached a free trade agreement with Bahrain, the first with a Middle East nation since President Bush announced his goal of creating a free trade area for the region. [World Business, Section W.]

HEADLINE: Report Links Oil Mergers To Slight Rise in Gas Prices

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 27 

 BODY:
An extensive series of oil company mergers in the 1990's reduced competition in gasoline sales, but the resulting changes in wholesale prices were small, the General Accounting Office said on Thursday. 
 The report comes at a time of high gasoline prices and renewed suspicion of whether oil companies are making unfair profits, but the study failed to find any significant effect from consolidation in the industry.
 The study covered 1990 to 2000, and of eight mergers studied, six led to price increases, averaging 1 to 2 cents a gallon, according to the report, and two resulted in decreases of about a penny a gallon. The biggest increase was 5 cents a gallon, said the report, which was prepared by Congressional auditors at the request of Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan. 
 ''The preponderance of price increases over decreases indicates that the market power effects, which tend to increase prices, for the most part outweighed the efficiency effects, which tend to decrease prices,'' the report said. ''Market power'' is an economist's term for the ability to limit competition and thus sell gasoline above competitive prices.
 Senator Levin requested the study in May 2001, when retail gasoline prices reached a peak of about $1.73 a gallon. That was about 25 cents higher than at the beginning or end of that year. Regular gasoline is now selling for just more than $2.05 a gallon on average, according to the AAA.
 Mr. Levin has questioned for years whether lack of competition was driving prices higher. He had no comment on Thursday, his office said.
 The study also said that the mergers might have reduced the ability of new companies to come into the markets but said that the data to answer that question did not exist.
 The mergers may also have reduced the amount of ''unbranded'' gasoline, or gasoline sold under names other than that of major national companies, which is generally less expensive, the study said. 
 The report indicated that large companies have closed some refineries and now have only enough capacity to serve their own needs.
 It added that in some cases these companies had decided to sell gasoline only in large quantities, freezing out small buyers. But the authors said that the data available to them did not allow them to determine the extent of the effect on prices.
 Price increases were driven by many factors, including the level of demand and of inventory, and the amount of refinery capacity available, the report said. 
 The Federal Trade Commission, which reviews proposed mergers to ensure that they do not reduce competition, said that the analysis by the accounting office was flawed.
 The two agencies have been trading letters since last August about the proper way to conduct such a study, with the chairman of the commission saying that the accounting office's study was ''so flawed that reliable judgments cannot be formed regarding the competitive effects of mergers in the petroleum industry.''
 But the commission and the accounting office, which did not make any recommendations, disagreed about how the study was conducted.
 The American Petroleum Institute, the industry's main trade group, pointed to the commission's objections to the study.
 The commission, it said, is ''the independent agency fully staffed with experts to deal with these issues.''

HEADLINE: Excerpts From Kerry Speech

BYLINE: By The New York Times

DATELINE: SEATTLE, May 27 

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from a speech on foreign policy that Senator John Kerry, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, gave on Thursday, as transcribed by Federal News Service Inc. A full transcript and video are at nytimes.com/politics.
 More than a century ago, Teddy Roosevelt defined American leadership in foreign policy. 
 He said America should walk softly and carry a big stick. Time and again, this administration has violated the fundamental tenet of Roosevelt's approach. As Roosevelt described it, if a man continually blusters, if he lacks civility, a big stick will not save him from trouble. 
 And that is precisely what this administration has ignored. They've looked to force before exhausting diplomacy. They bullied when they should have persuaded. They've gone it alone when they should have assembled a whole team. They have hoped for the best when they should have prepared for the worst. They've made America less safe than we should be in a dangerous world. In short, they have undermined the legacy of generations of American leadership, and that is what we must restore, and that is what I will restore. 
 It's time for a new national security policy that is founded on four principal imperatives. 
 First, we must launch and lead a new era of alliances for the post-9/11 world.
 Second, we must modernize the world's most powerful military to meet the new threats. 
 Third, because our military might is not the only source of power, of our power in the world, we must deploy all that is in the American arsenal: our diplomacy, our intelligence system, our economic power, and most importantly, the appeal, the extraordinary appeal that through centuries has made us who we are, the appeal of our values and our ideas. 
 Fourth and finally, to secure our full independence, our full freedom, to be the masters of our own destiny, we must free America from its dangerous dependence on Mideast oil.
 The first new imperative represents a return to the fundamental principle that guided us in peril and victory through the past century: alliances matter, and the United States must lead them. Shredding alliances is not the way to win the war on terror or even to make America safer. As president, my No.1 security goal will be to prevent the terrorists from gaining weapons of mass murder, and our overriding mission will be to disrupt and destroy their terrorist cells. The threat of terrorism demands alliances on a global scale, to find the extremist groups, to guard ports and stadiums, to share intelligence and to get the terrorists before they get us.
 In short, we need a coalition of the able, and in truth, no force on earth is more able than the United States and its allies. But building strong alliances is only the first step. We cannot meet the new threats unless our military is adapted for new missions. And that is the second imperative. 
 As president, on my first day in office, I will send the message to every man and woman in our armed forces, this commander in chief will ensure that you are the best led, best equipped fighting force in the world, and you will be armed with the right weapons, schooled in the right skills and fully prepared to win on the battlefield. But you will never be sent into harm's way without enough troops for the task or asked to fight a war, and you will never be asked to fight a war without a plan to win the peace. And you will never be given assignments which have not been clearly defined and for which you are not professionally trained. This strategy focuses not only on what we must do but on what we must prevent. We must ensure that lawless states and terrorists will not be armed with weapons of mass destruction. This is the single gravest threat to our security. Any potential adversary should know that we will defend ourselves against the possibility of an attack by unconventional arms. And if such a strike does occur, as commander in chief I will respond with overwhelming and devastating force. 
 If such an attack appears imminent, as commander in chief I will do whatever is necessary to stop it. Some believe that Al Qaeda would use an attack to try and influence the outcome of the November election. Well, I have a message today for Al Qaeda and for any terrorist who may be harboring these illusions: We may have an election here in America, but let there be no doubt, this country is united in its determination to defeat terrorism. 
 And we will never be deterred in our exercise of democracy. 
 So this is my message to the terrorists. As commander in chief, I will bring the full force of our nation's power to bear on finding and crushing your networks. We'll use every resource of our power to destroy you. 
 But not all problems should be viewed through a military lens. We should never wait to act until we have no other choice but war, and that brings me to my third new imperative. In this new world, beyond military power, we must deploy all of the power in America's arsenal, and we should do that before we go to war. We need to employ a layered strategy to keep the worst weapons from falling into the worst hands, a strategy that invokes our nonmilitary strength early enough and effectively enough so military force does not become our only option. 
 If we are serious about energy independence, then we can finally be serious about confronting the failure of Saudi Arabia to do all that it can to stop financing and providing ideological support of Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups. 
 We cannot continue this administration's kid glove approach to the supply and laundering of terrorist money. As president, I will impose tough financial sanctions against nations or banks that engage in money laundering and facilitate terror in this world, and we will take strong steps against those who fail to act. I will launch a ''name and shame'' campaign against those that are financing terror

HEADLINE: A Political Sacrament

BYLINE: By Kenneth L. Woodward. 
Kenneth L. Woodward, a contributing editor at Newsweek, is the author, most recently, of ''The Book of Miracles.''

 BODY:
Abortion was not expected to be a major issue in this election year beyond its usual function as a rallying point for each party's core constituencies. But now the nation's Roman Catholic bishops and the Democratic Party appear to be headed for a politically charged collision over abortion. 
 The point of contention is whether Catholic politicians -- notably the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, John Kerry -- can claim to be Catholics in good standing, and therefore worthy of the eucharist, while vigorously pursuing a policy of ''choice'' that is tantamount to unrestricted abortion.
 Like all emotional issues, this one requires some perspective. Last November, in response to a document from the Vatican, the bishops created a task force on Catholics in public life, headed by Cardinal Theodore McCarrick of Washington. To avoid any appearance of political meddling or favoritism, the task force planned to publish its recommendations after the November election. Coincidentally, the bishops are preparing another document on the eucharist, including the conditions under which holy communion is to be administered and received. 
 But as is their prerogative, a few bishops recently issued statements of their own, yoking one subject to the other. The most provocative came from Archbishop Raymond Burke of St. Louis, who declared that Mr. Kerry was not welcome to receive communion when campaigning in Missouri. The most eccentric statement was issued by Bishop Michael J. Sheridan of Colorado Springs, who said in a pastoral letter that Catholics who vote for candidates who support gay marriage, euthanasia or abortion rights must confess that sin before receiving communion. In New Jersey, Archbishop John J. Myers issued a pastoral letter advising pro-choice Catholic officeholders not to seek communion. Two other New Jersey bishops specifically mentioned Gov. James E. McGreevey, saying they would deny him communion for his support of abortion rights. 
 In response to these statements, 48 Democratic members of Congress, all Catholics, sent a letter to Cardinal McCarrick on May 10 expressing their ''hurt,'' defending their pro-choice positions and seeking a meeting with him. From the political right, the bishops have also heard from Catholic groups calling for ecclesiastical sanctions on pro-choice Democrats. Because of all this, the bishops will interrupt their scheduled retreat early next month to discuss these issues and -- it now appears -- release their report before the presidential election.
 No one can read the bishops' minds, of course, but at this stage it seems unlikely that they will bar any politicians from receiving communion. ''I do not favor a confrontation at the altar rail with the Sacred Body of the Lord Jesus in my hand,'' Cardinal McCarrick wrote on May 13. It is even less likely that Bishop Sheridan's position will find support, particularly because it calls on Catholics to give abortion precedence over other issues like war, education and poverty. The bishops -- indeed Pope John Paul II himself -- have repeatedly taught that Catholics, if they are to put their faith in action, must consider a wide range of issues involving economic and social justice when entering the voting booth.
 This is precisely the argument that pro-choice Catholic politicians want to make. Representative Rosa DeLauro, Democrat of Connecticut, and others have begun to argue that, with the exception of abortion, the Democratic Party is closer to Catholic social teachings on questions like capital punishment and the decision to wage war than is the Republican Party. 
 But this line of reasoning is fraught with peril. For the pope, the bishops and -- if polls are to believed -- for most practicing Catholics, abortion is the taking of innocent life and therefore violates the most fundamental of human rights. By contrast, the pope's opposition to capital punishment is conditional, not absolute, and the church's application of just war principles is open to reasoned debate. When it comes to abortion, there is far less room for discussion. 
 If the present situation comes with a twist, it is this: As recently as 40 years ago, Democrats were more likely than Republicans to oppose abortion. But in the ideological realignment of the party that took place in the 70's and 80's, a long procession of Catholic Democrats -- from Senator Ted Kennedy to Representative Dennis Kucinich -- embraced ''choice'' in their quest for higher office. 
 In recent years, the party has done little to welcome Catholics who oppose abortion. At the 1992 Democratic National Convention, party leaders prevented Robert P. Casey, the pro-life governor of Pennsylvania, from airing his views in a speech. As president, one of the few issues on which Bill Clinton would not compromise or triangulate was abortion. More recently, Mr. Kerry has said that if Senator John McCain, a Republican, agreed to be his running mate, ''The only thing he would have to do is say, 'I'm not going to appoint any judges who would overturn Roe v. Wade.' '' 
 Even now, Republicans can seem more flexible than Democrats in accommodating dissidents on the abortion issue. Think of Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, who just survived a primary fight with a pro-lifer, or of California's new pro-choice governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger. No wonder, then, that many Catholics have abandoned the party toward which they once felt tribal allegiance, and have become one of the largest blocs of swing voters in recent presidential elections. If the Democrats feel the bishops are out to stigmatize them, it is because on ''choice,'' the party seems to permit none.
 In the months to come, Democrats are likely to advance a number of reasons that they can support abortion rights and be good Catholics. In 1984, Mario Cuomo, then governor of New York, mounted the most nuanced apologia in his now famous speech at Notre Dame. But his rationale -- that he was personally opposed to abortion but publicly required to uphold Roe v. Wade -- now looks like ancient sophistry: having claimed that there was no public consensus opposing abortion, he worked to see that none developed.
 The bishops recognize that compromise lies at the heart of politics. But for those pro-choice politicians who do not see themselves as enablers of abortion, the bishops are prepared to connect the dots. It is possible that they may also ask those who hold to this view to voluntarily abstain from receiving the eucharist, which is a sign and privilege of full communion with the church. This is no more than is expected of adulterers, say, or those who divorce and remarry outside the church. This approach respects individual conscience.
 All the bishops can demand of any Catholic politician is that he or she act with an honest, undivided and informed conscience on moral issues of grave social consequence. Failing that, all they can hope for is the grace of a contrite heart.

HEADLINE: In Jordan's Scrapyards, Signs of a Looted Iraq

BYLINE: By JAMES GLANZ; Douglas Jehl contributed reporting from Washington for this article.

DATELINE: SAHAB, Jordan, May 26 

 BODY:
As the United States spends billions of dollars to rebuild Iraq's civil and military infrastructure, there is increasing evidence that parts of sensitive military equipment, seemingly brand-new components for oil rigs and water plants and whole complexes of older buildings are leaving the country on the backs of flatbed trucks. 
 By some estimates, at least 100 semitrailers loaded with what is billed as Iraqi scrap metal are streaming each day into Jordan, just one of six countries that share a border with Iraq.
 American officials say sensitive equipment is, in fact, closely monitored and much of the rest that is leaving is legitimate removal and sale from a shattered country. But many experts say that much of what is going on amounts to a vast looting operation. 
 In the past several months, the International Atomic Energy Agency, based in Vienna, has been closely monitoring satellite photographs of hundreds of military-industrial sites in Iraq. Initial results from that analysis are jarring, said Jacques Baute, director of the agency's Iraq nuclear verification office: entire buildings and complexes of as many as a dozen buildings have been vanishing from the photographs. 
 ''We see sites that have totally been cleaned out,'' Mr. Baute said.
 The agency started the program in December, after a steel vessel contaminated with uranium, probably an artifact of Saddam Hussein's pre-1991 nuclear program, turned up in a Rotterdam scrapyard. The shipment was traced to a Jordanian company that was apparently unaware that the scrap contained radioactive material. 
 In the last several weeks, Jordan has again caught the attention of international officials, as pieces of Iraqi metal bearing tags put in place by the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission, established to monitor Iraqi disarmament during Mr. Hussein's rule, have been spotted in Jordanian scrapyards. The observation of items tagged by the commission, known as Unmovic, has not been previously disclosed.
 ''Unmovic has been investigating the removal from Iraq of materials that may have been subject to monitoring, and that investigation is ongoing,'' said Jeff Allen, a spokesman for the commission. ''So we've been aware of the issue,'' he said. ''We've been apprised of the details of the Rotterdam incident and have been in touch with Jordanian officials.''
 Recent examinations of Jordanian scrapyards, including by a reporter for The New York Times, have turned up an astounding quantity of scrap metal and new components from Iraq's civil infrastructure, including piles of valuable copper and aluminum ingots and bars, large stacks of steel rods and water pipe and giant flanges for oil equipment -- all in nearly mint condition -- as well as chopped-up railroad boxcars, huge numbers of shattered Iraqi tanks and even beer kegs marked with the words ''Iraqi Brewery.'' 
 ''There is a gigantic salvage operation, stripping anything of perceived value out of the country,'' said John Hamre, president and chief executive of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a nonpartisan Washington research institute, which sent a team to Iraq and issued a report on reconstruction efforts at the request of the Pentagon last July.
 ''This is systematically plundering the country,'' Dr. Hamre said. ''You're going to have to replace all of this stuff.'' 
 The United States contends that the prodigious Middle Eastern trade in Iraqi scrap metal is closely monitored by Iraqi government ministries to ensure that nothing crossing the border poses a security risk or siphons material from new projects. In April, L. Paul Bremer III, the occupation's senior official in Iraq, and the Iraqi Ministry of Trade established rules for licensing the export of scrap metal from the country. 
 The sites now being monitored by the atomic energy agency include former missile factories, warehouses, industrial plants and sites believed to contain ''dual use'' equipment like high-precision machine tools that could be used either for civilian purposes or for making components for nuclear and other weaponry. Mr. Baute said that the analysis had been completed at about a dozen sites and that the agency was working to prepare a report on the entire monitoring program. 
 Sam Whitfield, a spokesman for the Coalition Provisional Authority, said that penalties for not obtaining a license or abiding by its terms were severe for a trucker. ''If he does not have it or is found to be exporting scrap illegally, not only can his load be seized but his truck can be seized,'' he said.
 Mr. Whitfield said that the overall quantity of scrap might not be surprising, considering that there were, for example, an estimated 3,000 damaged tanks and other military vehicles in Iraq as a result of a series of wars. Those vehicles are being legitimately scrapped, he said. 
 ''There's huge volumes of scrap out there, just all over Iraq,'' he said.
 A senior American intelligence official said the idea that the material to build missiles or nuclear devices might be being exported from the military-industrial sites was ''far-fetched.''
 ''It's conceivable that some of this material might be dual-use in nature,'' the official said, adding that ''what appears to be happening is simply looting.''
 Mr. Whitfield asserted that the coalition had put a stop to widespread looting in Iraq. But a visit to an enormous scrapyard on the side of a dusty hill surrounded by goat herds in this town about 10 miles southeast of Amman raises serious questions about that assertion. Cranes and men with torches pick through seemingly endless piles of steel, aluminum and copper that workers there say has come almost exclusively from Iraq.
 On a recent afternoon, roughly 100 trucks, many with yellow Iraqi license plates, were lined up near the entrance to the scrapyard or maneuvering with inches to spare inside, their engines snorting as they kicked up the flourlike dust. 
 Yousseff Wakhian, a scrapyard worker wearing a gray jumpsuit and a cap with a New York Yankees insignia, said that 60 to 100 trucks had come in that day from Iraq and 50 had left with loads of the scrap to be sold elsewhere.
 Some of the piles contain items that might -- or might not -- have arrived as part of legitimate scrap operations. There is stripped copper cable from a high-voltage electrical system, jumbled piles of tank treads, big engine blocks and crankshafts and thick steel walls connected to a door with lettering indicating that it was part of a building at an airport. 
 Last year, there were widespread reports of looting of electrical transmission lines and military bases, among other things. 
 But Muhammad al-Dajah, an engineer who is technical director Jordanian free-trade zones like the Sahab scrapyard, pointed with chagrin to piles of other items that hardly looked as if they belonged in a shipment of scrap metal. There were new 15-foot-long bars of carbon steel, water pipes a foot in diameter stacked in triangular piles 10 feet high, and the large flanges he identified as oil-well equipment. 
 ''It's still new,'' Mr. Dajah said, ''and worth a lot.'' 
 ''Why are they here?'' he asked rhetorically, and then said, referring to the devastation in Iraq. ''They need it there.'' 
 The scrap operation has not been without incident, Mr. Dajah said. A few months ago workers cutting apart an automobile at Zarqa, another free-trade zone, set off a concealed bomb that killed one of them, he said. 
 An Iraqi truck driver at Sahab, Ahmed Zughayer, said the trip from Karbala, where he picked up a load of tank parts that were still piled in the back of his truck, was insufferable because of delays at the Jordanian border. 
 ''First time and last,'' he said when asked how often he had made the trip. ''Seven days at the border being inspected. And here two days.'' 
 Mr. Zughayer said Jordanian military personnel had combed through the load and probed it with detection equipment. Officials at the atomic energy agency said that since the Rotterdam incident, radiation detectors at Iraq's borders had repeatedly picked up generally weak radioactive emissions from deep within loads of scrap. 
 The agency said that in one incident on May 15, radiation detectors began clicking when a truck carrying a load of scrap stopped at the Habur border crossing with Turkey; the truck was turned back.
 Several Middle Eastern analysts said that the widespread traffic in Iraqi scrap did not have all the hallmarks of an above-board operation.
 ''What we are finding out in Iraq, there are gangs, some of them from the old days, some of them new with corruption, and they can get away with it,'' said Walid Khadduri, an Iraqi who is editor of the Middle East Economic Survey in Cyprus and was in the country as recently as January. 
 ''It is really mayhem,'' Mr. Khadduri said. ''There is no law.''
 Labib Kamhawi, a Jordanian political analyst who has done business in Iraq under the oil-for-food program, said that there was in fact much talk in the business community of deals ''to ship new things under the title of scrap.''
 Beyond what has been seen at the scrapyards, Mr. Kamhawi offered no specific evidence that those deals were taking place. But a former high-ranking Jordanian military official said that functioning pieces of, say, sophisticated electronics from surface-to-air missile batteries or precision machine tools almost could not avoid being passed around with scrap, since it is so difficult to destroy such equipment completely.
 The official also said there was far from just a single Jordanian scrapyard doing a brisk business in Iraqi machinery and scrap. He said that only a few days before, he had seen nearly an entire Russian-made T-55 tank with Iraqi markings, its muzzle cut off by a blowtorch, sitting on a flatbed truck outside a steel plant near the road from Amman to the main commercial airport. 
 On a recent day, the plant, identified on a sign as part of the United Iron and Steel Manufacturing Company, a Jordanian business, had three trucks with Baghdad license plates idling out front. At a tumbledown shack on the way toward piles of steel in the distance, a wiry, weathered security guard with a three-day growth of beard stopped a car carrying an American journalist and two Jordanians. 
 ''No, you can't go in,'' said the guard, who identified himself as Azzam Tamimi. ''I have orders.'' 
 A Jordanian asked Mr. Tamimi what was down among the piles of steel to warrant barring visitors from the area. 
 ''Nothing is in there,'' Mr. Tamimi said. ''There is only destroyed Iraqi tanks from the war.''

HEADLINE: Gruner & Jahr Appoints a Chief Executive After a Difficult Search

BYLINE: By DAVID CARR

 BODY:
After a four-month search for a chief executive, Gruner & Jahr USA Publishing has turned to a relative unknown in the New York publishing world to help right a company reeling from overpriced acquisitions, a tempestuous court battle with a former partner and questions about the integrity of its magazines' circulation. 
 Gruner & Jahr announced yesterday that it had hired J. Russell Denson, who most recently was chief executive of the Reiman Media Group, a subsidiary of the Reader's Digest Association that publishes advertising-free hobbyist magazines like Birds and Blooms and Crafting Traditions. 
 In Gruner & Jahr, Mr. Denson, 53, takes over a troubled midsize publisher whose magazines include Family Circle, Fitness and Fast Company. The company suffered a public relations nightmare last year during its court fight with the former talk show host Rosie O'Donnell over the demise of their jointly owned magazine. Her lawyers accused the company of manipulating circulation figures for Rosie and other magazines including YM. 
 In January, Daniel B. Brewster Jr., the chief executive who had been hired in 2000 amid predictions of rapid growth, resigned. And through April, five of Gruner & Jahr's seven magazines are showing declines in ad pages compared with last year.
 The search for a new chief executive was not an easy one. At least one candidate -- John Loughlin, president of the TV Guide Publishing Group -- took himself out of the running, while other well-known media executives declined to be interviewed because of the depth of problems at the company and fears that the next chief executive would not have operational independence. 
 The company, a division of the German media company Bertelsmann, has been under the interim leadership of Axel Ganz, the president of the international division. Mr. Ganz, who recently received a two-year contract extension, will continue to oversee operations here.
 In addition, Gruner & Jahr was in talks to merge or sell its United States operations, most notably with Hachette Filipacchi Media U.S., a division of the large French-owned company, according to an executive involved in the discussions.
 Those talks -- in addition to a buyout offer from American Media Inc., which owns tabloids including The Star and enthusiasts magazines like Shape -- left executives at Gruner & Jahr unconvinced that it was time to exit the United States market. But a company that once said it had to grow to survive -- in 2000, Mr. Brewster said the company would double its revenue in five years -- now finds itself hemmed in by expanding rivals like Time Inc. and Conde Nast Publications. 
 The company's earnings dropped about $10 million last year, to about $70 million on revenue of about $400 million, approximately the same revenue it had in 2000. A proposed magazine about celebrity and style, Gala, is in limbo, the latest in a series of prototypes that have never made it to the newsstand. 
 But Mr. Ganz said the company was in the United States market to stay.
 ''We would not be hiring a C.E.O. if we were interested in a merger,'' Mr. Ganz said. ''We were approached by a number of companies, but we did not initiate those contacts.''
 Mr. Denson, who has a history of helping companies clean up troubled operations only to sell them, said he was taking over Gruner & Jahr to operate the business, not prepare it for sale.
 ''I talked over those issues with Axel,'' Mr. Denson said, ''and I'm confident that the company is committed to U.S. operations.'' 
 Mr. Denson, a low-key executive who lives in Houston, presents a remarkable contrast to Mr. Brewster, who came to Gruner & Jahr from American Express Publishing vowing to transform it from an also-ran to the front ranks of American publishing. 
 Mr. Brewster spent $360 million to acquire Fast Company just as the bloom was coming off the new-economy rose, and his attempt to rescue the floundering McCall's magazine through a partnership with Ms. O'Donnell ended in acrimony.
 Mr. Denson, before working at Reiman, was chief executive of Weider Publications, which was sold to American Media in 2002. He also served as the chairman of a company that published Health and Hippocrates magazines and the Edell health letter, all of which were sold to Time Warner. Mr. Denson also served as president of HEI Publishing, which published Medical World News, which was sold to Miller Freeman Publishing.
 Roger H. Kimmel, vice chairman of Rothschild Inc. who was on the board of Weider Publications when Mr. Denson served as chief executive, said Mr. Denson was more than capable of helping pull Gruner & Jahr out of the ditch.
 ''He is a terrific manager who understands financials and knows how to deal with people,'' Mr. Kimmel said. ''He did a terrific job at Weider.''
 Mr. Denson, who owns a Harley-Davidson and admits he occasionally motors around the hills of Texas without a helmet, may want to wear one when he meets with advertisers, many of whom were disappointed to learn the company was tinkering with the figures it gave to the Audit Bureau of Circulations.
 ''I think there was some validity to the concerns about the circulation issues that came out during the Rosie debacle,'' said Eric Blankfein, director of media planning at Horizon Media Inc. ''They still have some obvious strengths and some great brands, but they are going to have to play up those strengths and deal with some of the negatives that are out there.''
 Mark Edmiston of AdMedia Partners, a media investment bank, said: ''He doesn't have the kind of contacts in the advertising community that they need, but he can always hire for that. He is a proven operator who is used to working with multiple titles at Weider and Reiman.''
 Mr. Denson is making none of the expansionary promises made by his predecessor, indicating a more low-key approach for Gruner & Jahr. 
 ''We have to make sure that the foundation of the company is solid before we talk about adding a second story,'' Mr. Denson said. ''A lot of it is going to be just the basic blocking and tackling of publishing.''

HEADLINE: A Different Era for Alternative Energy

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
Sales of solar power equipment are hot. Wind energy projects are sprouting up across the landscape. Methane that builds up in the garbage in landfills is being sold in growing quantities to generate power. 
 Alternative energy -- solar, wind, geothermal and a grab bag of other sources -- is doing better than ever. But the main reason is not the increase in oil and natural gas prices.
 When the cost of fossil fuels rose and fell in past years, the fate of many alternative energy projects rose and fell with them. But that is no longer true. Indeed, even if prices eventually recede from their current level of about $40 a barrel to something in the $30 to $35 range, as many expect, analysts predict that most renewable energy projects will not suffer as badly as they once did. 
 ''We're in a very different era from the late 1970's,'' said Dan Reicher, who served as the top energy official responsible for alternative and renewable energy sources under President Bill Clinton. ''The technologies have improved dramatically and come way down in price.''
 While alternative energy sources may be growing rapidly, they are starting from such a small base that their overall role in the energy supply remains small, because alternatives still remain more expensive than energy produced from fossil fuel.
 The Government's Energy Information Agency said recently that production from renewable energy sources in the United States was 15.5 percent higher in the first two months of this year than the same period in 2003. But the agency estimates that renewables accounted for just 6.4 percent of domestic energy consumption last year and that their contribution will climb to 6.7 percent this year. 
 This modest increase is reason for optimism, proponents say. Even before oil prices took off, they note, the outlook for solar energy was brightening, with worldwide annual revenue from equipment and installation expected to climb from $4.7 billion last year to $30.8 billion in 2013, according to Clean Edge, a market research firm in San Francisco. Similarly, after a record expansion last year, permits for new wind energy projects in the United States are piling up as investors wait anxiously for Washington to renew tax credits that make them more profitable. 
 Geothermal energy is also getting more interest. In Idaho, Carl F. Austin, a veteran of 40 years in geothermal energy, is feeling good about his chances for raising money for what he hopes will be that state's first geothermal power project.
 ''Conditions are the best I've ever seen,'' Mr. Austin said, ''and every prediction is that it's going to get better.'' 
 Experts debate just how competitive alternative energy sources are versus fossil fuels, though there is no dispute that over all the price gap has narrowed as oil and natural gas prices have soared and new technologies have made alternative sources more efficient. 
 The cost of wind power varies widely with the quality of the windmill site, but prime locations in the United States generate electricity at well under 5 cents a kilowatt-hour, making them cheaper than natural-gas-fired plants at current gas prices. But to compete with coal, wind power generally needs subsidies like the tax credit of 1.8 cents a kilowatt-hour that lapsed at the end of last year. 
 Electricity-generating solar panels, which were invented 50 years ago and cost $100 a watt in 1976 now sell for less than $3 a watt, and are expected to continue declining 5 percent annually in cost even if there are no technology breakthroughs.
 For now, solar energy technology is approximately 10 times as expensive as traditional fossil fuel systems for generating large amounts of electricity, according to a recent estimate by the Sandia National Laboratories. But solar is already a cheaper alternative for powering sites that are long distances from the power grid. 
 The public reaction to recent price spikes in oil prices could help alternative energy by putting pressure on politicians to maintain or even increase the vast range of tax credits, grants, loan guarantees and other subsidies that stimulate investment in alternatives. 
 Still, while the rise in prices certainly brightens the profit potential for many alternative energy investments, the increase is too recent -- and too many investors are convinced it will not last -- to account for why the sector is thriving. 
 Far more important these days is that the new technologies are now seen as essential to meeting crucial environmental goals. 
 Traditional fossil fuels like coal, oil and natural gas are major contributors to air pollution and the buildup of climate-changing gases in the atmosphere. Their environmental cost is not fully included in current prices but regulations intended to limit the damage have restricted their growth prospects. 
 Thus, although coal prices remain relatively low, Mr. Austin figures his geothermal project is unlikely to face competition from new coal plants unless somebody comes up with an unexpected technology breakthrough that minimizes coal's environmental impact without driving up its cost. 
 Some technologies, like fuel cells, normally use conventional energy sources but are viewed as alternatives because they deliver small quantities of clean electricity and heat at distributed sites instead of in central power plants. But many of the alternatives use renewable resources like the sun and wind.
 Another factor favoring alternative fuels over time is that the most accessible deposits of fossil fuel are being rapidly depleted. Increased costs to recover remaining supplies are inevitable, energy experts say. That leaves innovations in how the fuels are converted to energy as the only barrier to rising prices over the long term.
 At the same time, alternative energy sources are being viewed more and more as a worthwhile insurance policy against the risk of depending on the Middle East and other unstable regions for the bulk of the world's oil and gas supply. 
 ''Businesses are fundamentally shifting the way they look at energy,'' said R. Neal Elliot, an industrial energy efficiency expert at the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, a nonprofit policy analysis group based in Washington. 
 In the 1970's and 1980's, risk management meant investing in boilers that could burn different fuels and buying futures contracts that guaranteed access to crucial fossil fuels at an acceptable price, Mr. Elliot said. Now it means stepping up investment in products and processes that cut energy use and adding alternative sources of energy.
 Hence the appeal of projects like the pipeline and gas processing operation near Spartanburg, S.C., that provides BMW's automobile factory there with power and heat extracted from waste methane. The methane is drawn from a landfill nearly 10 miles away that is owned by Waste Management, based in Houston. 
 The project began operation last year. It was built and is operated by Ameresco, an energy management company from Framingham, Mass., that is charging BMW a fixed price over the next 20 years for the electricity and heat.
 The BMW factory gets more than a quarter of its electricity and 10 percent of its useful heat from the methane. 
 Waste Management, meanwhile, has decided the methane from decomposing garbage in its many landfills is a major business opportunity. It is looking to build and operate electricity generating plants or methane supply operations at as many of its landfills as possible, according to Paul A. Pabor, who became the company's first vice president for renewable energy in January.
 Thirty-one projects have been completed and eight new ones are in development, Mr. Pabor said.
 Today's oil and natural gas prices are largely irrelevant to Waste Management's profit calculations. 
 Indeed, the major projects and investments unfolding today are primarily the legacy of past alarms, including the California electricity shortages of 2001, the start of the war in Iraq in early 2003 and last summer's blackout in the northeastern United States and Canada. 
 ''Any successes for alternative energy because of today's prices won't be under the Christmas tree this year,'' said Tim Woodward, managing director at Nth Power, a venture capital company in San Francisco that invests in a wide range of energy technology start-ups. ''They could show up in 2005.''

HEADLINE: Colombians Urged to Drink More and Better Coffee (Their Own)

BYLINE: By JUAN FORERO

DATELINE: BOGOTA, Colombia, May 28 

 BODY:
Colombia may assert proudly that it grows the world's best coffee, but Eva Celeita knows that most of her fellow Colombians do not know how to brew a decent cup.
 On a recent morning, standing next to an overhead projector at the National Federation of Coffee Growers, Ms. Celeita carefully explained how to make espresso to a group of young baristas embarking on careers as counter clerks making everything from cappuccinos to mochas to frozen coffee drinks at the federation's new franchise, Juan Valdez cafes.
 Ms. Celeita, who oversees quality control for the cafes, is helping lead a federation effort to urge Colombians to drink more of their own coffee and, in the process, help extricate the country's troubled coffee industry from its doldrums. This summer, as part of that broader effort, it will open its first Juan Valdez cafe in the United States. 
 ''Colombian coffee is the smoothest in the world,'' Ms. Celeita said, ''but what does that matter if it comes out too bitter, or if it comes out with no taste at all?'' She then explained how everything from the cleanliness of the machine to the temperature of the water helps determine the quality of a cup of coffee. 
 The concept may be alien. In this country of rolling coffee pastures and Juan Valdez -- the mythical coffee farmer used for promotions since 1959 -- it has not been easy to find a good cup of coffee.
 The premium beans have traditionally been exported. What is left behind has wound up as a tepid, flavorless drink that Colombians call tinto, a colloquialism for black coffee but, perhaps not coincidentally, the Spanish word for stained.
 For as little as 20 cents, coffee sellers in downtown Bogota pull a thermos from a cart and pour tinto into a flimsy plastic cup.
 ''I drink four a day, nice big ones,'' said Obdulia Garzon, 70, a vendor, as she sipped her tinto on a busy pedestrian mall. ''I'm not sure what people see in espresso. It is too much money to drink a cup of that coffee, and people want it just because it has a lot of foam.'' 
 For years, Colombians' penchant for watered-down coffee was just fine with the federation and the 550,000 coffee farmers it represents.
 Then a drop in consumption, coupled with a glut in production, led to a steep plunge in prices. A pound of Colombian coffee now goes for 79 cents at wholesale, an improvement over the 55 cents it brought in 2001, but still low compared with the 1999 price of $1.23.
 So the federation is seeking new ways to market its coffee. That includes going after a largely untapped market, Colombia's 42 million people, a population as big as that of Spain, where people drink twice as much coffee.
 Most Colombians, even children, drink coffee. But the rate of consumption is just half that of the United States and less than in many European countries. Colombians also prefer to drink their coffee cheap; they would never pay the $3.50 a cup charged by New York cafes.
 ''The Colombian has not been accustomed to drinking a cup of coffee of any real quality,'' Gabriel Silva, the federation's general manager, said in an interview in his Bogota office. The federation has watched with interest as the world's coffee powerhouse, Brazil, which can produce up to 40 million sacks a year, doubled internal consumption to 14 million sacks through an aggressive advertising campaign in the 1990's.
 In Colombia, where only 1.2 million of the 12 million sacks produced annually are consumed, the strategy is to increase domestic consumption quickly, to three million sacks within five years. ''We think it's possible,'' Mr. Silva said, ''because we're starting from such a low base.'' 
 In a multipronged effort to revitalize the industry, which employs up to four million people during the twice-a-year harvests, the federation is helping farmers grow organic coffee and other specialty types. It is also stepping up marketing efforts worldwide with Juan Valdez, his trusty mule at his side.
 In its drive to win more of the world's $8.4 billion specialty coffee market, the federation will open a Juan Valdez cafe in Washington in late August. The second United States cafe will follow quickly, in September, at 57th Street and Lexington Avenue in New York. The federation wants to open 300 cafes worldwide within five years.
 It is also going into the coffee-machine-making business. In a joint venture with Salton Inc. of Chicago and Rossi of Italy, it wants to sell sleek single-cup machines, featuring the Juan Valdez label. Mr. Silva said the machines, designed by Rossi, built by Salton and featuring coffee pots made by the federation, could represent $300 million in annual sales.
 The strategy is, in part, to reduce the reliance on the middleman, giving Colombia's coffee growers a bigger slice of the pie. 
 Getting Colombians to drink more coffee, either at the 11 new Juan Valdez cafes around the country or by prodding them to buy more expensive brands, is another tactic.
 ''There's no magic bullet,'' Mr. Silva said, ''but a basket of solutions.''
 Here in Bogota, at the federation's gleaming offices, researchers in white lab coats ensure that Colombian beans produce a premium cup of coffee. 
 In one room, metal jars, carefully catalogued, contain samples of beans produced nationwide. In another, beans are roasted and coffee is brewed, with rows of cups set up for taste testers.
 David Acuna, a physicist who coordinates the operation, said the laboratory is especially important with the federation focusing on selling quality coffee at home.
 Sipping a cup of coffee, Mr. Acuna smiled.
 ''I love that foam, I'm sorry, but I just love it,'' he said. ''You know, this really is very good.''
 In the rest of Colombia, though, taste buds are not so well developed.
 The coffee of choice here is Sello Rojo, or Red Label, a cheap but abundant mix that produces a light-tasting cup. At neighborhood cafes and restaurants, owners make the drink in huge vats, the coffee often watered down.
 Even at old cafes like Cafe Pasaje, once a meeting place for literati like Gabriel Garcia Marquez, the customers prefer their tintos, even though cappuccino and espresso machines are commonplace.
 ''Here everyone likes it clear, really clear,'' said German Arias, the manager. ''No one knows what real coffee is. It's the strangest thing, because I like it dark and strong, but people do not go for that.'' 
 Still, there are signs that specialty coffees are finding a market, helped by a rebounding economy and a solid middle class. The Oma chain, Colombia's largest franchise of cafes, has grown from a handful five years ago to more than 50 today.
 ''Now we have cafes, we have espresso machines,'' said Irme Milena Mayorga, who once helped develop specialty coffees for the federation. ''Even though coffee is a Colombian symbol, we are now just starting to learn about it.''
 Ms. Mayorga, owner of Specialists in Coffee, now trains restaurant and cafe employees on the art of preparing a good cup of coffee. On a recent day, as six students listened closely, she explained the characteristics of espresso.
 Her hope is to end what she called ''our culture of the diluted coffee.''
 ''What you have here has nothing to do with coffee,'' she said.

HEADLINE: To Bolster Competitiveness, Dredging Is Planned in Bay

BYLINE: By RICHARD LEZIN JONES

DATELINE: ELIZABETH, N.J., May 28 

 BODY:
Hoping to gain a competitive edge in international shipping, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey signed an agreement on Friday with the Army Corps of Engineers to deepen channels around New York Bay to 50 feet to accommodate a new generation of extra-large cargo ships.
 At the same time, Gov. James E. McGreevey, citing terrorism concerns, called on federal officials to do a better job of inspecting cargo streaming into the Port of New York and New Jersey, the largest port on the East Coast. 
 ''The same way we focus on international airport traffic, we need to focus on cargo traffic,'' Mr. McGreevey said shortly after a dockside news conference at the Port Authority Marine Terminal.
 The governor noted that while ship manifest lists are closely scrutinized, workers are scanning only about 5 percent of the cargo that comes into Port Newark-Port Elizabeth. He said that figure should increase about fourfold.
 ''Right now, we're investigating the manifest, investigating the paperwork that comes through this port,'' Mr. McGreevey said, ''but we need to do a better job of literally hands-on investigating the cargo.''
 The agreement reached by the Port Authority and the Army Corps opens a period when the corps can begin awarding contracts for the deepening of the channels, which currently have depths ranging from 30 to 45 feet. Dredging to deepen the channels is expected to begin in early 2005 and the entire project -- which will include the Ambrose, Anchorage, Kill Van Kull, Newark Bay, Bay Ridge and Port Jersey channels -- is scheduled for completion in 2014.
 The Army Corps and the Port Authority will split the $1.6 billion cost of the project.
 Saying that the project was essential for local ports to keep pace with counterparts in Norfolk, Va., and Halifax, Nova Scotia, Mr. McGreevey said the project was overdue. 
 ''If we don't have these 50-foot dredge depths we're not going to be competitive,'' he said. ''This is an exercise in common sense. This is an exercise in ensuring the economic vitality of the port.''
 Currently, the Port of New York and New Jersey provides more than $20 billion in economic benefit to the region and roughly a quarter of a million jobs. Officials said that over the next half century, the deepening of the channels will more than double the number of jobs. 
 Governor McGreevey, on hand to witness the signing of Friday's agreement, was joined by public officials from both sides of the bay, including Democratic Representative Robert Menendez and Republican Representative Rodney P. Frelinghuysen, both of New Jersey, and Democratic Representative Jerrold L. Nadler, who represents parts of Manhattan and Brooklyn, who called the agreement ''a great milestone.''
 ''We must stay a step ahead of all our rivals,'' Mr. Nadler said, referring to commercial ports around the country.
 More than 42 million cubic yards of sediment will be removed as part of the dredging. Officials said the material would be reused in various ways, ranging from creating fishing reefs to capping landfills, including Fresh Kills on Staten Island.
 Over the past few years, as officials began considering plans to dredge, environmentalists had expressed concern about the effects of the effort on the region. Cindy Zipf, executive director of Clean Ocean Action, an environmental group based near the Jersey Shore, said she supported the project, with one stipulation.
 ''We have no problem with deepening the harbor,'' Ms. Zipf said. ''It just needs to be in compliance with the law.''

HEADLINE: Consumer Spending and a Factory Index Rise

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Consumer spending rose in April and a measure of manufacturing business in the Chicago area increased to the highest level in almost 16 years, adding to evidence that economic growth is strengthening.
 Personal spending rose 0.3 percent in April after a March increase of 0.5 percent, which was larger than previously estimated, the Commerce Department reported. The National Association of Purchasing Management-Chicago said its index of area businesses rose to 68 this month, the highest level since July 1988. A reading above 50 signals expansion. 
 The reports indicate that the economy is on track to continue expanding as demand for goods and services rises and factories add workers to keep up with orders, economists said. Signs of higher prices may prompt a rise in interest rates as early as next month from Federal Reserve policy makers, who have said they plan to increase overnight lending rates at a ''measured'' pace.
 ''Consumer spending is sustainable without additional tax cuts and that is key to sustaining economic growth,'' said John Silvia, chief economist at the Wachovia Corporation in Charlotte, N.C. ''Job growth as well as income growth is kicking in.''
 Incomes rose 0.6 percent in April, the most since November, after rising 0.4 percent in March, the Commerce Department said. Wages and salaries rose 0.5 percent after a 0.3 percent gain.
 The Chicago purchasing management report is watched by economists and investors for clues about the strength of manufacturing. Of the 10 largest counties in the country, only Los Angeles has more manufacturing jobs than Cook County, which includes Chicago and many of its suburbs, according to figures from the Labor Department.
 Economists had estimated personal spending would rise 0.2 percent after a previously reported 0.4 percent increase in March, according to the median of 70 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey. They had also expected a 0.5 percent gain in April incomes after a 0.4 percent rise reported for the month before. They also forecast a reading of 62 in the May Chicago index.
 The University of Michigan's final index of consumer sentiment fell to 90.2 in May from 94.2 in April. Rising gasoline prices and violence in Iraq may be to blame.
 A measure of inflation tied to spending, the personal consumption expenditure price index, rose 0.1 percent last month after a 0.3 percent increase in March, the report showed. Excluding food and energy prices, the index also rose 0.1 percent after a 0.2 percent March increase.
 The slowdown may make it easier for the Fed policy makers to be deliberate in raising their target interest rate to help curb inflation.
 ''Fed officials will probably take some comfort in these inflation readings,'' said John Ryding, chief market economist at Bear, Stearns in New York. ''For now, therefore, the Fed likely remains committed to a gradualist path.''
 Disposable income, or the money left after taxes, rose 0.5 percent in April following a 0.4 percent rise the previous month, the Commerce Department report showed. It is up 4.3 percent in the 12 months that ended in April.
 Adjusted for inflation, spending on nondurable goods fell 0.2 percent. Spending on services, which account for almost 60 percent of all outlays, rose 0.3 percent after rising 0.2 percent the previous month. Durable goods spending rose 0.8 percent after rising 0.9 percent in March.
 Consumer spending, which accounts for 70 percent of the economy, grew at a 3.9 percent annual pace from January through March, the Commerce Department said.

HEADLINE: Brazil Resolves Complaint On Florida Juice-Import Tax

BYLINE: By TODD BENSON

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil, May 28 

 BODY:
Brazil agreed on Friday to withdraw a two-year-old complaint at the World Trade Organization against a Florida state tax on Brazilian orange juice imports. 
 The accord ends a longstanding dispute between Brazil and the United States, the world's top twocitrus producers.
 In a joint letter to the W.T.O., the two countries said that they had negotiated a ''mutually satisfactory solution'' to Brazil's challenge of a $40 tax Florida imposed on each metric ton of imported Brazilian orange juice. Brazil filed its claim at the W.T.O. in August 2002. 
 Growers in Florida have long argued that the tariffs were needed because Brazilian producers do not have to meet health and safety standards as demanding as those in the United States, making juice production cheaper in Brazil. The money from the so-called equalizing excise tax was used to finance advertising campaigns for Florida juice.
 In its W.T.O. complaint, Brazil, the world's No.1 citrus grower and exporter of frozen concentrated orange juice, charged that the tax was discriminatory and protectionist. Juice importers in Florida also criticized the tax and challenged it in court.
 Nearly two years of bilateral talks between government officials and industry representatives from both countries ensued, culminating in a vote in the Florida Legislature in March that amended the orange juice tax. Now juice importers will be required to pay only one-third as mcuh and can demand that their tax money go to the Florida Department of Citrus to finance research projects instead of advertising campaigns. Gov. Jeb Bush ratified the changes on May 12.
 ''We're ending the case in the W.T.O. because there's no need for it now,'' Clodoaldo Hugueney, the under secretary for economic affairs at Brazil's foreign ministry, said in a telephone interview from Brasilia.
 ''We achieved our goals through dialogue, and we're very pleased with the outcome,'' he said, adding that he hoped Friday's agreement would help put an end to years of bitter finger-pointing between the countries' orange industries.
 The deal removes a major sticking point from efforts to forge a Free Trade Area of the Americas agreement by next January's target date. Florida's orange juice tariffs have long bogged down the hemispheric trade talks.
 ''It seems that good will and common sense are prevailing, and that should allow us to move on to an agenda that's less conflictive,'' said Adermerval Garcia, president of Abecitrus, the trade association representing Brazil's orange juice exporters.
 Mr. Garcia, whose group lobbied the Brazilian government to challenge Florida's orange juice tariffs at the W.T.O. in the first place, said that he did not expect the agreement to translate into an immediate jump in juice exports to Florida, but rather into an increase in revenue.
 Last year, Brazil exported 1.1 million tons of frozen orange juice, bringing in $1.3 billion in revenues, according to industry data. About 70 percent of those exports went to Europe, while only 15 percent were shipped to the United States.
 The decision to withdraw the orange juice complaint comes just one month after Brazil won a huge victory at the W.T.O. over American cotton subsidies. The preliminary ruling, which is expected to be upheld in June, was the first successful challenge of a wealthy nation's domestic agricultural subsidies.

HEADLINE: Allen-Edmonds Keeps Its Shoes On an American Factory Floor

BYLINE: By AARON NATHANS

DATELINE: PORT WASHINGTON, Wis. 

 BODY:
The rumble, hum and clack of the Allen-Edmonds shoe factory went quiet in late December. Many of the machines that helped workers pack insoles, trim the leather and buff the finished men's dress shoes were gone by New Year's Day. 
 But John Stollenwerk, the president of the company, was not preparing to send his operations overseas. Instead, Mr. Stollenwerk gambled on staying put and reconfiguring his factory floor, which reopened on Jan. 5, with a new manufacturing method that could increase production and cut down on mistakes. The moves required an investment of $1 million, or 1.1 percent of the company's 2003 sales. 
 Mr. Stollenwerk is resisting a tide that has decimated the American shoe manufacturing industry: About 98.5 percent of shoes sold in the United States are now made abroad, according to the American Apparel and Footwear Association, which is based in Arlington, Va.
 But the numbers behind Mr. Stollenwerk's decision to stay show the stark economic choices facing manufacturers. He hopes the million-dollar refitting will save the company 5 percent on each shoe. He could save 60 percent tomorrow, he acknowledged, if he moved his manufacturing to China.
 ''It's costly to stay here because of the wages we're paying, the benefits, the rules and regulations of the government for having a safe workplace, for having a clean workplace, the emissions permit, taxes, health care,'' Mr. Stollenwerk said. ''They're all good things, don't get me wrong.'' 
 Allen-Edmonds, founded in 1922, gained much of its following by providing the Army and Navy with shoes during World War II. Many men continued to wear the shoes for the rest of their lives. The company, which makes small batches of men's dress shoes in a variety of widths that sell for upwards of $200, claims both presidents named Bush as customers.
 But patriotism will get a shoe manufacturer only so far these days. In 1968, just before worldwide tariffs on footwear were reduced, 642 million pairs of shoes were manufactured domestically. In 2003, that number was down to just 60 million, mostly specialty products made in the Upper Midwest, Southwest and North Carolina, according to the association. 
 Most shoe retailers need quantity, said Fawn Evenson, president of the association's footwear division. The rise of chain stores like Sears, Roebuck and J.C. Penney, and later Wal-Mart Stores and Target, increased the demand for mass production, she said. 
 ''You just can't beat it,'' Ms. Evenson said of Chinese shoe factories, where she said workers make as little as $100 a week and put in 10-hour days. ''These plants are modern, clean, they are unbelievably efficient, and they get a very good price.'' 
 New Balance once made all its shoes in the United States, but as they became more popular, the company added plants in China, said the chief executive, Jim Davis. Today, New Balance makes 25 percent of its shoes domestically, he said. Allen-Edmonds may have to make the same hard decisions if the shoes prove popular enough, Mr. Davis said.
 ''It might be hard for them to increase sales over time unless they change,'' he said. ''They'll make more shoes, but they might not make enough.'' 
 Another company with domestic manufacturing, the Minnesota-based Red Wing Shoe Company, makes work boots, typically for union laborers who would not stand in anything imported, said Peter Engel, the director of marketing.
 Michael Atmore, editorial director of the trade publication Footwear News, said patriotism did not often extend to buying shoes. 
 ''Consumers today are less concerned about where something's made than ever before,'' he said ''In part, they've been conditioned to accept that products come from all over the world.''
 The most obvious competitive disadvantage at Allen-Edmonds is that it pays its workers well, even by domestic standards. The average worker in the Port Washington plant makes about $15 an hour before benefits, Mr. Stollenwerk said.
 Ms. Evenson said the company's loyal following flowed from its unique manufacturing process. The company stitches a strip of leather, known as a welt, to the sole, negating the need for a rigid metal shank. The company says that makes for a more comfortable fit, as well as more ease in getting through airport security screeners.
 The company takes special orders, which it can turn around fast, said Jim Kass, director of operations. A customer can send his shoes to be resoled and get them back in three or four weeks, Mr. Kass said. That speed would be impossible if the shoes were sent abroad, he said.
 Mr. Stollenwerk, who works in a cubicle alongside his employees, said his company made a nice profit, but declined to discuss specific earnings figures. Sales reached their highest point in 1999 at $95 million. Sales in 2003 are estimated to reach about $88 million, up 10 percent from 2002, according to previously published figures confirmed by the company. The company has cut about 10 percent of its work force through attrition over the last five years, but turnover dried up recently as workers realized they did not have many options left in the manufacturing sector, Mr. Stollenwerk said. 
 To keep things in the black, Mr. Stollenwerk is making big changes at his main factory. He is shutting down one of four Allen-Edmonds plants and consolidating it with the Port Washington site. The company will maintain plants in Milwaukee and Lewiston, Me. 
 The old assembly line in Port Washington is being replaced by a system of employees working in groups, with each person doing several jobs, each trained to do the other's tasks. The new method will cut down on time wasted on picking up and putting down shoes, as well as mostly eliminating overtime, Mr. Kass said. 
 Under the new system, the worker who flattens the welt will then fill in the shoe's bottom with a layer of hot cork, before sending it on. That should cut down on spoiled shoes, allow workers to fill in for sick colleagues with more ease, and lessen repetitive strain, said Tim Goetsch, lead worker at the factory.
 The changes will also include installing computerized machinery left behind by the Dexter Shoe Company, which left Maine for China in 2001.
 Mr. Stollenwerk said the women in Maine who performed the fancy, detailed side stitching on Allen-Edmonds penny loafers were nearing retirement age, with no one to replace them. That work may someday have to be sent to the Dominican Republic, he said.
 Mr. Stollenwerk acknowledged that he has felt tempted to move operations to China, but said that could lead to a decline in quality. If his company ever went to China, he said, it would have to open its own factory there. 
 He said it was sadly amusing to see university students marching against low wages, factory closings and other social problems brought on by globalization. ''Those very people are walking around with shoes made in China with 64-cent-an-hour labor and no benefits,'' Mr. Stollenwerk said. ''The very thing they're marching against, they're supporting.''
 But do they have a choice?
 ''No,'' he said. ''It's more and more difficult. Therein lies the problem.''

HEADLINE: Mixed Day, but Indexes Post Solid Gains for the Week

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Strong reports for consumer spending and earnings were not enough to fend off the preholiday doldrums on Wall Street yesterday as stocks finished mixed in an uninspired session. The major indexes, however, did manage a week of solid gains for the first time in more than a month.
 Profit taking after the previous session's rally kept prices lower as investors took a rare chance to lock in gains. Volume was low in advance of the Memorial Day holiday as well. 
 ''We've made some good progress in the past few days, but the market's tired,'' said Russ Koesterich, equity strategist at the State Street Corporation in Boston. ''The market was oversold coming into mid-May. Investors have been nibbling, but we haven't seen the kind of volume that would suggest that the institutions are really coming in.''
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 16.75 points, or 0.2 percent, to 10,188.45. Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slipped 0.60 point, to 1,120.68, and the Nasdaq composite index was up 2.24 points, or 0.1 percent, at 1,986.74.
 For the week, the Dow gained 221.71 points, or 2.2 percent, the S.&P. rose 27.12 points, or 2.5 percent, and the Nasdaq was up 74.65 points, or 3.9 percent. It was the first positive week for the Dow and S.&P. after four straight weeks of losses, while the Nasdaq posted its second consecutive week of gains.
 The last week also helped the markets finish the month on a positive note, leading some analysts to believe the markets have reached their short-term lows and will move higher in June. For the month, the S.&P. rose 1.2 percent and the Nasdaq was up 3.5 percent, while the Dow was down just 0.4 percent.
 For the year so far, the S.&P. was 0.8 percent higher, while the Dow was down 2.5 percent and the Nasdaq was off 0.8 percent.
 The Commerce Department reported that consumer spending rose 0.3 percent in April, another solid gain after an increase of 0.5 percent in March.
 Even more encouraging, personal income rose by 0.6 percent in April, after a gain of 0.4 percent in March -- a sign that consumers will have more to spend in the future. 
 Joseph V. Battipaglia, chief investment officer at Ryan Beck & Company, attributed the sluggish performance to investors being unwilling to make major new commitments ahead of the three-day weekend and with a threat of a terrorist attack looming.
 ''The best you can say is the market has held the gains of the week,'' Mr. Battipaglia said. 
 Shares of semiconductor makers rose across the board after Novellus Systems, a maker of chip manufacturing equipment, raised its earnings and revenue goals for the second quarter. In a midquarter conference call, executives were bullish about their business prospects and said conditions were improving steadily. Novellus was up $1.91, to $33.29; Intel rose 10 cents, to $28.55; and National Semiconductor gained 71 cents, to $21.67.
 Riggs National, a commercial banking company, jumped $3.10, to $21.84, after The Washington Post reported that it had hired an investment bank to seek potential buyers.
 El Paso, the energy company, fell 52 cents, to $7.21, after it said its financial reports for the fourth quarter of 2004 and first quarter of this year had not yet been audited. The company announced earlier this month that it would revise the results after employees overstated oil and gas production levels.
 Bond prices fell in an abbreviated preholiday session as traders considered economic reports.
 The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 16/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.66 percent from 4.60 percent on Thursday.
 The 30-year Treasury bond fell 11/32 to yield 5.34 percent, up from 5.31 percent a day earlier.

BYLINE: Reuters

 BODY:
The HSBC Holdings banking company said that its performance this year had exceeded its expectations, but it warned of an uncertain economic outlook amid high oil prices and rising interest rates. HSBC, which has operations in 79 countries, has benefited from a global economic recovery and from rising employment in its leading markets, the chairman, Sir John Bond, above, told the company's annual meeting. ''In the first four months of this year, our results across all our customer groups and all geographic regions were ahead of the same period in 2003,'' Sir John said. Rising interest rates in the United States and high oil prices have not yet affected economic activity and a recovery might be uneven, he said.

HEADLINE: Bush Points The Way

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF. 
E-mail: nicholas@nytimes.com

 BODY:
I doff my hat, briefly, to President Bush.
 Sudanese peasants will be naming their sons ''George Bush'' because he scored a humanitarian victory this week that could be a momentous event around the globe -- although almost nobody noticed. It was Bush administration diplomacy that led to an accord to end a 20-year civil war between Sudan's north and south after two million deaths.
 If the peace holds, hundreds of thousands of lives will be saved, millions of refugees will return home, and a region of Africa may be revived. 
 But there's a larger lesson here as well: messy African wars are not insoluble, and Western pressure can help save the day. So it's all the more shameful that the world is failing to exert pressure on Sudan to halt genocide in its Darfur region. Darfur is unaffected by the new peace accords.
 I'm still haunted by what I saw when I visited the region in March: a desert speckled with fresh graves of humans and the corpses of donkeys, the empty eyes of children who saw their fathers killed, the guilt of parents fumbling to explain how they had survived while their children did not.
 The refugees tell of sudden attacks by the camel-riding Janjaweed Arab militia, which is financed by the Sudanese government, then a panic of shooting and fire. Girls and women are routinely branded after they are raped, to increase the humiliation.
 One million Darfur people are displaced within Sudan, and 200,000 have fled to Chad. Many of those in Sudan are stuck in settlements like concentration camps.
 I've obtained a report by a U.N. interagency team documenting conditions at a concentration camp in the town of Kailek: Eighty percent of the children are malnourished, there are no toilets, and girls are taken away each night by the guards to be raped. As inmates starve, food aid is diverted by guards to feed their camels.
 The standard threshold for an ''emergency'' is one death per 10,000 people per day, but people in Kailek are dying at a staggering 41 per 10,000 per day -- and for children under 5, the rate is 147 per 10,000 per day. ''Children suffering from malnutrition, diarrhea, dehydration and other symptoms of the conditions under which they are being held live in filth, directly exposed to the sun,'' the report says.
 ''The team members, all of whom are experienced experts in humanitarian affairs, were visibly shaken,'' the report declares. It describes ''a strategy of systematic and deliberate starvation being enforced by the GoS [government of Sudan] and its security forces on the ground.'' Read the 11-page report at www.nytimes.com/kristofresponds, Posting 426.
 Demographers at the U.S. Agency for International Development estimate that at best, ''only'' 100,000 people will die in Darfur this year of malnutrition and disease. If things go badly, half a million will die.
 This is not a natural famine, but a deliberate effort to eliminate three African tribes in Darfur so Arabs can take their land. The Genocide Convention defines such behavior as genocide, and it obliges nations to act to stop it. That is why nobody in the West wants to talk about Darfur -- because of a fear that focusing on the horror will lead to a deployment in Sudan.
 But it's not a question of sending troops, but of applying pressure -- the same kind that succeeded in getting Sudan to the north-south peace agreement. If Mr. Bush would step up to the cameras and denounce this genocide, if he would send Colin Powell to the Chad-Sudan border, if he would telephone Sudan's president again to demand humanitarian access to the concentration camps, he might save hundreds of thousands of lives.
 Yet while Mr. Bush has done far too little, he has at least issued a written statement, sent aides to speak forcefully at the U.N. and raised the matter with Sudan's leaders. That's more than the Europeans or the U.N. has done. Where are Tony Blair and Jacques Chirac? Where are African leaders, like Nelson Mandela? Why isn't John Kerry speaking out forcefully? And why are ordinary Americans silent?
 Islamic leaders abroad have been particularly shameful in standing with the Sudanese government oppressors rather than with the Muslim victims in Darfur. Do they care about dead Muslims only when the killers are Israelis or Americans?
 As for America, we have repeatedly failed to stand up to genocide, whether of Armenians, Jews, Cambodians or Rwandans. Now we're letting it happen again.

HEADLINE: U.S. Signs Trade Agreement With Central America Nations

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 28 

 BODY:
The United States and five Central American countries signed a free trade agreement on Friday that the Bush administration hopes will lead to an even bigger hemisphere-wide free trade deal by next year.
 The Central American Free Trade Agreement still faces stiff opposition in Congress, however, as many Democrats contend that it fails to do enough to protect American workers from unfair competition from low-wage countries.
 The agreement is also likely to become an issue in this year's presidential campaign. The presumptive Democratic nominee, John Kerry, said that he opposed the deal as negotiated by the Bush administration because it did not have enforceable rules on labor rights and environmental protection. 
 In a statement, Mr. Kerry said that he would bring the Central American countries ''back to the negotiating table to develop an agreement that provides economic benefits, creates jobs and includes strong protections for labor and the environment.''
 In his remarks at the signing ceremony, the United States trade representative, Robert B. Zoellick, commented on differences between Mr. Kerry and President Bush over trade issues. Mr. Zoellick asserted that ''opportunism and economic isolationism'' were being used to attack efforts to promote democracy in Latin America.
 The five Central American countries that participated in Friday's signing were Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua. The ceremony was held in an ornate hall at the Organization of American States, while outside a small band of demonstrators paraded with signs saying, ''Make trade fair.''
 The Dominican Republic reached agreement in March to join the Central American pact, but it could not take part in Friday's signing ceremony because of United States rules requiring a 90-day notice period to Congress before the administration can sign trade deals.
 When the pact is presented to Congress, it will include all six countries. It was uncertain, however, when the administration and Republican leaders would bring the pact up given strong opposition from Democrats and even some Republicans.
 The administration is hoping that momentum generated by the Central American deal will spur stalled negotiations on a Free Trade Agreement of the Americas, which would create a free trade zone linking 34 nations in the Western hemisphere; Cuba would be excluded. The agreement is scheduled to be concluded by next January if wide differences over such issues as agriculture can be bridged by then.

HEADLINE: Haiti Struggles to Cope With New Disaster

BYLINE: By TIM WEINER

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, May 29 

 BODY:
Gray storm clouds gathered again over Haiti's flood-ravaged mountains on Saturday as tens of thousands of homeless survivors huddled for shelter, a small earthquake struck the region, and estimates of the dead and missing stood near 2,000.
 International aid workers said Saturday that people fleeing the flood walked for hours or days seeking safety in the mountains of the Massif de la Salle, whose summits rise up to 8,793 feet, and some had walked over the mountains down to the sea.
 The aid workers, assisted by American, Canadian and Chilean soldiers, are still burying the dead and searching for the missing, while trying to keep the living alive. They say they confront a crisis far worse than they imagined in a country ill-equipped to manage daily life, much less this disaster. 
 The treasury of the provisional government that replaced President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who was ousted three months ago, contains only a few million dollars. The government's ministries barely function. The Health Department was all but destroyed by the rebels who helped overthrow Mr. Aristide.
 ''The government is doing the best it can,'' Henri Bazin, Haiti's finance minister since March, said in an interview. ''It is obvious that we do not have sufficient means to face this crisis.''
 He said the government could provide $250,000 to cope with the flood. United Nations agencies have about $380,000 available, officials said.
 The French foreign minister, Michel Barnier, met with Haiti's interim president, Boniface Alexandre, and pledged help. ''We are providing food and water, but that is not enough,'' Mr. Barnier said.
 Promised aid from foreign governments remains mostly undelivered. ''I don't think it's anything but promises yet,'' said Sheyla Biamby of Catholic Relief Services.
 The United States said it was providing $50,000 for flood relief in Haiti; the Organization of American States, $25,000. That comes to about $1 for each of the roughly 75,000 people believed to have been affected by the flood, according to United Nations workers still trying to reach small villages cut off by mudslides.
 A 4.4 magnitude earthquake was reported Saturday afternoon in the Haitian flood zone by Dominican government seismologists. Its immediate effects were unknown.
 While foreign countries and aid agencies are also sending relief to the Dominican Republic -- where hundreds, many of them Haitians, were killed in the border town of Jimani -- the problems are far graver in Haiti.
 Mr. Alexandre said survivors from flooded villages -- like Mapou, where 1,000 are feared dead -- might have to be forcibly relocated. ''We need to find a better place for them, and if the appropriate land is privately owned, the government must expropriate it,'' he said.
 In Mapou on Saturday, the American-led international force ferried supplies by helicopter as aid workers, including two Cuban doctors, tried to help thousands. Mapou is uninhabitable. Its floodwaters are graveyards breeding the threat of malaria, dengue fever and hepatitis.
 Mapou's survivors may have to be relocated to Thiotte, a three-hour walk away. Where they would live once they arrived remains unanswered.
 Every road between the capital, Port-au-Prince, and the flooded villages has been erased. Food, water, medicine and the basics of life -- cooking pots, cups and spoons -- cannot reach the survivors without helicopters.
 Most of the 14 helicopters in Haiti capable of lifting tons of supplies belong to the American military. The soldiers of the American-led force, which occupied Haiti after Mr. Aristide fell, are to leave June 30.
 The road to Mapou cannot be fixed by then, said Jean-Paul Toussaint, Haiti's public works minister. 
 There is little level ground to build shelter in southeast Haiti, and no dry ground anywhere at the moment. The spring rains have been far heavier than usual, said Mr. Bazin, the finance minister. Six feet or more fell in the past week in some areas. Rain is forecast through the weekend. The hurricane season starts in June.
 Both Haiti's deep poverty and international politics complicate the country's ability to recover. The government is nearly bankrupt, in part because Mr. Aristide's government was at best inefficient and at worst corrupt over the past three years, foreign officials here say.
 Mr. Aristide's administration had six months' of foreign reserves in the treasury when he regained office in 2000. Foreign reserves are the hard currency a government holds in its central bank to ensure solvency. When Mr. Aristide fell, there were three days' of reserves, a senior Haitian official said.
 In addition, many nations cut off direct foreign aid to Mr. Aristide, Haiti's first democratically elected president, and the Bush administration increased diplomatic and political pressure against him, perceiving him as hostile and unstable.
 But the way in which Mr. Aristide was overthrown -- with tacit American support -- meant that Haiti's new interim government remains unrecognized by Caricom, the economic community of Caribbean nations. So Haiti's neighbors, including Jamaica, have been wary of providing assistance.
 Haiti suspended diplomatic ties with Jamaica, which holds the leadership of Caricom, after Mr. Aristide took refuge there in March. He was set to leave on Sunday for a permanent exile in South Africa. That may smooth the way for Caricom to help ease Haiti's latest troubles.

HEADLINE: Soaring Gas Prices. Traffic Nightmares. Let's Hit the Road!

BYLINE: By Hubert B. Herring

 BODY:
You might think that this Memorial Day weekend, with gas prices at $2 a gallon and counting, Americans might glance at the gas guzzlers in their driveways, cancel those trips and curl up with a good Dickens novel. 
 You might think wrong. 
 AAA reports that 37 million people, 3.6 percent more than last year, planned to travel 50 miles or more this weekend. And a survey of 1,000 adults by Paymentech, a transaction processor, finds that a third of the nation's citizens plan to go somewhere -- 79 percent of them by motor vehicle. 
 Are concern about the economy and Iraq spurring people to count their holiday pennies? Not much. Fully 20 percent, Paymentech reports, have put aside $400 or more for their weekend wanderings. It says patriotic destinations like Independence Hall in Philadelphia and the new World War II Memorial in Washington should lure crowds. Hubert B. Herring

HEADLINE: Liberty Bonds' Yield: a New Downtown

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
LIBERTY BONDS were meant to revitalize Lower Manhattan. They are on the verge of transforming it, too.
 Several thousand rental apartments are being created in projects that have benefited from more than $1 billion in tax-exempt Liberty Bond financing, not only through the conversion of old office buildings but -- even more strikingly -- by the construction of new residential towers in the middle of the financial district and on the outskirts of the civic center.
 A 45-story apartment tower at 10 Liberty Street, where tenants will begin moving this summer, shares an intersection with 1 Chase Manhattan Plaza and the Federal Reserve Bank. A block away, on tiny Gold Street, the concrete form of an even larger neighbor is rising toward the 52nd floor. And for a site near City Hall, Frank Gehry is designing an apartment tower with space for Pace University and NYU Downtown Hospital. 
 At 10 Liberty Street, rents start at $2,400 a month for a 650-square-foot, one-bedroom apartment; $3,870 for a 1,006-square-foot, two-bedroom unit. Downtown developers generally are seeking rents around $45 a square foot annually. ''What makes deals more attractive down there is that almost every building is offering incentives,'' said Andrew Heiberger, president and chief executive of the Citi Habitats brokerage firm.
 Still, the buildings financed by Liberty Bonds unquestionably fall under the luxury rubric. Not everyone approves. 
 ''It truly has changed how people are going to live in Lower Manhattan and who's going to live there,'' said Bettina Damiani, project director of Good Jobs New York, which monitors economic development subsidies. ''What Liberty Bonds are doing for the residential market of Lower Manhattan is, unfortunately, really speeding up the gentrification process.''
 Housing officials respond that Liberty Bonds were not intended to create affordable housing, but to rebuild an area that was still staggering when the program began in 2002.
 ''At the time, the occupancy rate was 65 percent,'' recalled Emily A. Youssouf, the president of the city Housing Development Corporation and a downtown resident for 18 years. ''Living down here, and making a conscious decision to stay, I had a lot of neighbors who were fleeing, selling apartments at rock-bottom prices.'' The Liberty Bond program, she said, showed that the government was ''not afraid to make a statement about revitalizing Lower Manhattan'' at that precarious moment.
 Residential occupancy rates are now 95 percent, according to the Alliance for Downtown New York. Carl Weisbrod, the president of the alliance, credited both Liberty Bonds and residential retention grants with reversing the post-9/11 exodus.
 ''In that sense, it was government programming at its very best,'' he said. On the downside, Mr. Weisbrod said, the fact that Liberty Bonds could be applied only to rental buildings ''skewed the decisions of developers from home-ownership product.'' That is important, he said, because ''ownership units provide a much greater stake in the community and much less transience -- not to say we don't welcome rental buildings.''
 All told, the federal government authorized $1.6 billion in tax-exempt financing for multifamily rental projects in the so-called Liberty Zone south of Canal Street. Issuance of the bonds was divided between the city Housing Development Corporation and the state Housing Finance Agency.
 ''This isn't an $800 million giveaway,'' said Stephen J. Hunt, president and chief executive of the state agency. ''This is financing for $800 million. These developers are still taking a significant risk.''
 Because interest on these bonds is not subject to federal, state or city taxes, purchasers accept lower interest rates. That means lower costs for borrowers, including builders like the Elghanayan family of Rockrose Development, the Albanese family of the Albanese Organization, Stephen M. Ross of the Related Companies and Leonard Litwin of Glenwood Management.
 It also benefited Frank J. Sciame, F. Anthony Zunino III, Richard S. Berry and the Durst Organization, developers of an unusual project along Front Street in the South Street Seaport Historic District. Eight buildings are being renovated and three new buildings constructed to create 96 units. It received $46.3 million in state-issued bonds.
 When the partners were negotiating to buy the property, the ''aftershocks of 9/11 were still rippling through the downtown residential market,'' said John M. Evans of Sciame Development. ''Liberty Bonds provided the critical margins that enabled the Bank of New York to step forward at that time and underwrite the project.''
 To date, the city has closed $478.6 million in Liberty Bond financing for four projects with 1,934 units. Already completed is the conversion of 90 Washington Street by the Moinian Group into 398 apartments. The others involve the conversion of 63 Wall Street and 90 West Street and the construction of 2 Gold Street.
 The corporation charges a 3 percent fee to developers and uses that to subsidize apartments at other sites for low- and middle-income tenants. Alluding to a tax-exempt financing program that reserves 20 percent of a building for lower-income tenants, Ms. Youssouf said, ''We, in essence, did an 80-20, but in a very inventive way.'' The four downtown projects will generate 390 units at 760 Melrose Avenue, 3880 Orloff Avenue and 1011 Washington Avenue in the Bronx; Beach 96th Street in Queens; and 1652 Park Avenue in Manhattan. 
 ''The mayor does get credit for creativity,'' said Ms. Damiani of the Good Jobs watchdog group.
 The state has issued or authorized $675.8 million in Liberty Bond financing for seven projects with 1,837 units: three new buildings at the north end of Battery Park City; new buildings at 10 Liberty Street and 10 Barclay Street; the conversion of 100 Maiden Lane; and the Front Street project.
 The state's version of the affordable-housing provision requires developers to reserve 5 percent of their units for tenants earning no more than 150 percent of the median income in New York City. For one person, that would currently translate as a maximum income of $66,000 to qualify for a $1,650-a-month studio. A family of three could have a maximum income of $84,750 to qualify for a $2,119-a-month two-bedroom apartment. At 10 Liberty Street, for example, 10 one-bedroom and five two-bedroom units have been set aside.

New Buildings
Liberty Plaza And Golden Hill
 The incongruity of 10 Liberty Street takes some getting used to. The slender tower is unmistakably residential. Its rosy-brick facade is folded into domestically scaled window bays that take advantage of surprisingly open vistas. The building benefits from being surrounded by Louise Nevelson Plaza, Chase Manhattan Plaza and its own 40-foot-deep plaza on Cedar Street.
 The plaza generated a 20 percent bonus in a zoning district where floor area is limited to 15 times the lot size. That yielded a structure with a floor-area ratio, or F.A.R., of 18-to-1. But residential density cannot exceed 12-to-1, so Glenwood merged its zoning lot with two adjacent buildings on Maiden Lane. When the residential density from 10 Liberty Street is calculated over this larger site, the 12-to-1 ratio holds.
 Since the rental office opened three weeks ago, 10 percent of the 287 units have been leased. Tenants are to begin arriving in mid-August. State-issued Liberty Bonds provided $95 million of the financing for the $125 million project.
 The building, called Liberty Plaza and designed by the Stephen B. Jacobs Group, has no studios. In part, said Gary Jacob, the executive vice president of Glenwood, this reflected a belief that downtown is becoming ''more of a permanent community.''
 There will be three-bedroom apartments at 10 Barclay Street, which will rise 56 stories alongside St. Peter's Roman Catholic Church and have 381 units. The architects are Costas Kondylis & Partners. Construction is to begin later this summer and be completed in January 2006.
 The $185 million project will be financed with $135 million in bonds. Critics of the program have suggested that Mr. Litwin received preferential treatment from the Pataki administration because of campaign contributions, noting that Glenwood had been granted 29 percent of the total state allocation for residential Liberty Bonds.
 But Mr. Jacob rejected the notion of favoritism, saying that the financing was awarded on the merits and that Glenwood's total represented only two projects.
 ''We're putting in a tremendous amount of equity and taking a tremendous amount of risk,'' he said. ''We bought these properties before there was a Liberty Bond program.'' Because Glenwood already owned its sites, he said, it was a step ahead in applying for a program that worked on a first-come-first-served basis.
 Rockrose, too, was on the scene long before Liberty Bonds. It began assembling the site for what is now 2 Gold Street in 1998, when it envisioned a ''blockbuster corporate office building,'' in the words of Jon McMillan, director of planning.
 What it is building is still a blockbuster -- by far the largest single apartment building under Liberty Bonds. Its 650 units are expected to range from $1,900 for a studio to $3,400 for a two-bedroom unit when they become available in the spring of 2005. The $225 million project received $170.3 million in city-issued Liberty Bond financing.
 Avinash K. Malhotra is the architect of the tower, which has projecting glass bays to increase a sense of openness. David Rockwell is designing the lobby and other common areas, Thomas Balsley the plaza. And Gustavo Bonevardi, one of the designers of the ''Tribute in Light'' memorial near the World Trade Center, has devised a sculpture for the plaza forming the word ''two.''
 Two Gold Street incorporates a tiny remnant of 19th-century mercantile New York: the front wall of 211 Pearl Street, a five-story red-brick counting house completed in 1832 for William Colgate, the founder of what is now Colgate-Palmolive.
 The Pearl Street leg of the property will serve as the ramp to the underground garage. Rockrose intended to raze No. 211 and had received permits to do so. But preservationists intervened and a deal was struck to save the facade, as well as a section of interior brickwork with distinctive -- but mysterious -- triangular patterns.
 Cars will drive into the garage between the original granite columns. The facade is now supported by a six-and-a-half-foot-deep steel framework. When that is enclosed, it will form a kind of shadow box. Mr. McMillan said Rockrose is talking with Creative Time, an organization that produces public artwork, to turn that unusual space into ''something wonderful.''
 Stores in the new project will occupy two floors of the base. ''We're aiming at retailers that cater to the residential community,'' Mr. McMillan said, meaning food and housewares. ''With the addition of 2 Gold and 10 Liberty, there will suddenly be the critical mass and concentration of residents to make a neighborhood.'' Rockrose is even ready with a name, resurrecting the area's 18th-century designation: Golden Hill.

Old Buildings
Brown Brothers And a 9/11 'Miracle'
 ''We don't really see the building as catering exclusively to the Wall Street crowd,'' said Nathan Berman, though he and Yaron Bruckner are converting one of the more venerable addresses in the financial district: 59-63 Wall Street, long the home of Brown Brothers Harriman & Company, the oldest partnership bank in America.
 Only 20 percent of the tenants who have signed up since April are financial district employees, Mr. Berman said. And somewhat to his surprise, about 30 percent of the tenants are committing themselves to two-year leases. The project was financed through $132.5 million in tax-exempt bonds.
 Tenants are to start arriving in July. The 37-story tower will have 476 apartments, beginning at $1,800 for a 420-square-foot studio and rising to $6,000 for a 2,000-square-foot penthouse. Mr. Malhotra, who is working on 2 Gold Street, has also designed the conversion of the 73-year-old building. The original architects were Delano & Aldrich.
 To obtain historical preservation tax credits, the developers are maintaining the great Brown Brothers rotunda and banking room, a 10,000-square-foot hypostyle hall with 24-foot ceilings. It is to be a grand lounge, designed by David Schefer Design, with a game room, 24-seat theater, television, billiard table, card table and baby grand piano. ''This becomes an extension of the tenant's living room,'' Mr. Berman said.
 The entrance rotunda, where yoga classes may be held, is ornamented with ironwork bearing back-to-back B's, for Brown Brothers and -- as fate would have it -- Bruckner and Berman. ''We didn't even have to change the banister,'' Mr. Berman said.
 Few structures downtown are as ornamented as 90 West Street, designed by Cass Gilbert and completed in 1907, six years before he awed the world with the Woolworth Building. And no landmark was as badly damaged on 9/11, though the mere fact of its survival, only 100 yards from the trade center inferno, was amazing enough.
 ''A lot of people called it the miracle building,'' said Ms. Youssouf of the housing corporation, which issued $106 million in financing for the $142 million restoration and renovation project by the Kibel Companies, Brack Capital Real Estate and BD Hotels. The developers are also taking advantage of historic preservation tax credits.
 ''It's more expensive and elaborate than anything we've done,'' said Peter Levenson, a principal in the Kibel Companies. The cost includes $4 million to rebuild the copper mansard roof. Contractors are also repairing, replacing or recreating the elaborate terra cotta and the massive granite base. ''At this moment, this is the largest hand-carved granite job in the world, I'm told,'' Mr. Levenson said.
 Acknowledging vexations, he also relishes finding treasures like the original groined ceiling vaults in the lobby, which was long obscured by a false ceiling, and the surprisingly colorful terra cotta -- lemon chiffon, cornflower blue, jade green -- toward the top of the 23-story structure.
 The restoration architect is H. Thomas O'Hara. But Gilbert's hand is present, too, in floor plans that wrap around a courtyard in a U shape, allowing apartment layouts without windowless ''home office'' rooms.
 ''It's as if this building were built to be residential,'' Mr. Levenson said. There will be 410 studios, one-bedroom and two-bedroom apartments that should be ready for tenants in the late summer or early fall of 2005, almost four years exactly after the landmark building was ravaged.

Future Buildings
Growing Demand, Shrinking Pipeline
 In addition to Glenwood's 10 Barclay Street project, other large new residential buildings on the horizon include a one-million-square-foot mixed-use project designed by Mr. Gehry for the Forest City Ratner Companies. The city Housing Development Corporation is considering a $130 million bond issue for the residential portion of the project, at 170 William Street.
 Should the corporation approve the Forest City Ratner project, it would be left with about $191 million in financing potential for a pipeline with nine applicants. ''We have a lot more demand than we have Liberty Bonds,'' Ms. Youssouf said.
 Battery Park City will get two more buildings with state-issued bonds, which also financed the Solaire at 20 River Terrace.
 The Albanese Organization, builders of the Solaire, expects to break ground next month on a 253-unit project at Site 18B, on Murray Street and North End Avenue. Like the Solaire, it is to be a ''green'' building, with elements to conserve energy, reduce water consumption and improve air quality. Cesar Pelli & Associates and SLCE Architects, collaborators on the Solaire, are designing the building. It received $100 million in Liberty Bond financing.
 The Related Companies announced last week that work had begun on the 24-story, 274-unit Tribeca Green at Site 19B, on Warren Street and North End Avenue. It is also a ''green'' development, following the Battery Park City Authority's environmental guidelines. Robert A. M. Stern Architects and Ismael Leyva Architects are designing it. The $121 million project received $110 million in Liberty Bond financing.
 Next month, the Housing Finance Agency board is to consider $120.35 million in bonds for a 346-unit project by A.I. & Boymelgreen at 88 Leonard Street. That will virtually exhaust the state allocation. Four applicants are still in line, which Mr. Hunt, the agency president, takes as an encouraging sign of confidence in Lower Manhattan.
 ''We've gone through $800 million and we did what Congress asked us to do: we provided jobs and hope downtown,'' he said. ''I think we gave it a good jump start.''

HEADLINE: Iraq Self-Rule Becomes a Test of Nerves As Leaders Face Threats and Violence

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER; Warzer Jaff contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, May 29 

 BODY:
At a recent local government meeting in the Rashid neighborhood of south Baghdad, the first item on the agenda was a moment of silence for council members in other districts who had been assassinated. 
 Then the Rashid Council turned to teachers' salaries and access to a garden. Moments later, during a break, the whistle and crash of a mortar shell pierced the cigarette smoke and din of conversation. People rushed out in panic. ''It's a mortar!'' someone yelled. 
 The council is one of hundreds set up to promote democracy by giving Iraqis practice in the give and take of local government. But democracy is proving an increasingly dangerous business these days. Several councils, including this one, have been the targets of attacks, and their members labeled American collaborators. Councils now meet under military protection. 
 Weeks away from the June 30 ceremonial transfer of sovereignty to an Iraqi government, Americans and Iraqis are starting to question whether the democratic reforms the United States is trying to install here will carry over.
 The weeks of fighting in Falluja and the south, in which many Iraqi civilians have died, and the Abu Ghraib prison scandal, have made the democracy program an even harder sell. 
 ''Trying to make this thing work is a true badge of courage,'' said Albert E. Haines, the Baghdad team leader for RTI International, the American company leading the local government program in Iraq under contract with the Agency for International Development. 
 In addition, the democracy program is being sown in an uncertain climate. Iraqis are still trying to bridge ethnic and religious fault lines in their society as they work to form an interim government that will start on June 30. And in the days leading up to the transfer, American officials have warned that the violence will only get worse. 
 ''When you talk about democracy now it may seem to be an inappropriate time, but that will all come later,'' said a member of the Iraqi Governing Council, Mahmoud Othman. ''But there are steps toward removing the uncertainty so it could go either way. There is a race with the escalation of violence, because there are people who will try to put obstacles and make chaos.'' 
 The program has set up hundreds of local councils, held civic dialogues and presented guidance on topics like the virtues of keeping budget transactions public. National conferences have been held on politics, the rights of the disabled and other subjects. The program has built a staff of about 2,500 Iraqis working as discussion leaders. 
 At the Rashid Council, members have had to be concerned about their safety as well as community services. The names of at least nine members were found on a leaflet written by the Sheik Ahmed Yassin Brigades, a little-known group in Iraq named for a leader of the militant group Hamas who was killed last month by Israeli forces in the Gaza Strip.
 ''We decided to liquidate the following spies,'' the leaflet said, before going on to list them, for ''cooperation with the American occupiers.''
 Sami Sharif, the council leader, attributed the violence to groups that want political power on their own terms. ''There are a lot of Islamic groups that lost the chance to participate on the city councils at the beginning,'' he said. ''Now when they see the role of these councils, they do not like the idea they have no one on them.'' 
 In Sadr City, one of Baghdad's poorest and most volatile neighborhoods, the office of the democracy project's local council is ringed by soldiers and sandbags. Troops hunker down in armored vehicles in the courtyard. The hallways are cluttered with Army cots and trash from military rations. Dozens of soldiers are sprawled out on worn armchairs, their weapons within reach.
 ''To some, this building is a symbol of the American oppression,'' said Sgt. First Class Keith Crabtree, an American who is now based in the building. ''But we try to view it as a symbol of the changes we are trying to bring to this area. It is not working as well as I would like it to work.''
 At the end of April, the leader of the Sadr City Council, Jasim Swady, was forced into a car at gunpoint. His body was found the next day hanging from a light pole, said Iraqis there.
 Brig. Gen. Mark Kimmitt, the American deputy director for operations in Iraq, said Mr. Swady had been found with a sign on his chest that read ''Mahdi Army business.'' Iraqis said it read ''American spy.'' 
 After that, the council suspended all its meetings and the doors were closed on the conference room. Now its chairs are empty, and the round table is coated with dust. 
 Like many other projects in Iraq these days, the democracy program needs stronger security. ''There are more than we care to admit of security guards on the payroll,'' said Chuck Costello, the man in charge of the democracy project in Iraq. ''An unfortunate necessity.'' 
 During an interview, Mr. Costello's right arm was in a sling because he had broken his collarbone diving for cover during a mortar attack. He does not travel outside Baghdad, and he leaves the fortified compound of the Coalition Provisional Authority and other related offices only to go to a local hotel or the offices of RTI International. 
 As he discussed ''methodology'' and ''democratic tools,'' his voice twice trailed off, drowned out by the clatter of low-flying combat helicopters. 
 A successful democracy, he said, ''especially in this society, involves overcoming fear.''
 ''Sometimes in democratic transitions, people have to put their lives on the line and fight for it,'' he said.
 In Iraq, this is one of those times.
 After four American contractors were killed in Falluja and the American military started an offensive there, councils in 4 of 15 Baghdad areas canceled meetings or suspended work indefinitely. Town halls and meetings were attacked by suspected militant groups. 
 The program nearly came to a ''grinding halt,'' Mr. Haines said. In Baghdad, 10 of the 14 international staff members were evacuated or did not return from vacations. He said the program had begun relying more on its Iraqi staff. 
 The 127 neighborhood and district councils in the Baghdad area are not operating at their full capacity. ''We find it difficult for these councils to find a secure environment to operate,'' said Imad Jonaby, an Iraqi specialist with the RTI program. ''Either their places become a target for militant groups, or some of them get threats on their lives.'' 
 Defenders of the program say it is a sign of success that Iraqis can be vocal about their criticisms of the military occupation, the Falluja offensive and the prison abuse, and then still use the councils to discuss reforms. ''We believe in using the good things the Americans bring and ignoring the bad things,'' said Muhammad Assadi, 32, a lawyer and a member of the Rashid Council. 
 But other Iraqis interviewed in Baghdad expressed deep cynicism about the American intentions. ''We suspected it was all lies when the Americans said they were here for democratic ideals,'' said Bassim Muhammad, a 30-year-old man in a barber shop in Karada, the central commercial district. ''When the Americans handled things in Falluja the way they did, it was a lie proven over a year.'' 
 American actions intended to sow the seeds for a transition to a democratic society have been criticized, even by supporters of the occupation. Abdel-Basit Turki resigned as Iraq's human rights minister over the use of excessive force by the American military in Falluja, Iraqi newspapers quoted him as saying. 
 The Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, which is represented on the Iraqi Governing Council, sponsored a recent demonstration in Baghdad that criticized the decision to reintroduce Baath Party officials into some positions. A banner showing the Statue of Liberty crying tears of blood drove home the point. 
 If this was democracy, protesters asked, why were such decisions not made in consultation with Iraqi political parties? 
 ''We want rights, but not through the Baathists,'' said Hussein Hashem, 52, who has a deformed hand that he said was broken during torture. ''Whoever makes these decisions should be someone with interests in defending those rights.'' 
 Even if the security situation improved, Iraq's lack of both a democratic tradition and free elections would still pose a challenge for the democracy program to gain traction. 
 At a town hall meeting in Baghdad recently, Iraqis registered to take part in the formation of an electoral commission that would prepare for and carry out national elections no later than January 2005. 
 A statement quoted some of them as saying that they were relieved that their choices for government were no longer being dictated to them, but that in many ways the country was not ready. ''We must persist in this process,'' said Sheik Dhia al-Shakarji, a member of the town hall panel. ''People will find fault with any government, democratic or not. We need a culture of ethics in Iraq.'' 
 But some Iraqis worry that the line between the country's brutal past, which the occupation authorities want to eradicate, and its future, which they want to have a role in steering, has been corrupted.
 ''They said there is no difference between Saddam and United States troops because they used the same ways of torture,'' said a summary of 66 of the democracy program's civic dialogue meetings after the Abu Ghraib prison photographs had been published. 
 ''The people said they couldn't deal now with allied forces, especially after they saw the dark side of the soldiers. The facilitators told people that changes would not happen in one day, but step by step. People said that they are happy with the idea of democracy but they didn't see it in reality. They just saw the chaos.''

HEADLINE: CHINESE FRIENDS

BYLINE: By JASON ZINOMAN

 BODY:
IF Michael Moore wrote an episode of ''The Twilight Zone,'' it might look something like the new drama ''Chinese Friends.'' Set in 2030, Jon Robin Baitz's play, which opened on Thursday at Playwrights Horizons, imagines disastrous consequences for the United States as a result of the policies of the Bush administration. Mr. Baitz, known for morally complex works like ''The Substance of Fire,'' says it is his first play written out of ''repulsion.''
 It begins with America in chaos -- politically isolated, economically ruined and wracked by anarchy. ''It's like one of those apocalyptic movies on Channel 11 that you watch on a hot day, like 'Soylent Green' or 'The Omega Man,' '' Mr. Baitz said by phone. 
 The disaster scenario emerged out of the failure of conservative economic policy and American imperialism. ''In the cosmology of the play,'' Mr. Baitz said, ''U.S. defense spending keeps increasing, the deficit balloons, jobs continue going overseas and less and less is spent on education, creating a surge of bewildered and undereducated children let loose on a collapsing America. Arguably, it's exaggerated, but these conditions do exist.''
 ''Chinese Friends'' is as much about disappointment with what Mr. Baitz sees as the listless left as it is about disdain for the radical right. The excerpt below, taken from early in the play, is a conversation between Arthur and Ajax Brice, who represent two kinds of backlash against the conservative ruling class.
 Arthur Brice, the father, is a former political operative who worked in a left-wing administration soon after President George W. Bush was out of power. Brice senior was part of a radical group, called the killer humanists, born out of frustration with the caution of the Democratic Party. While in power from 2008 to 2012, they started rolling back the gains of the far right, using methods that could be extreme and sometimes brutal. ''Arthur Brice is a Wolfowitz of the left,'' Mr. Baitz said, referring to the deputy defense secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz. ''Now what would that look like?''
 His son, Ajax, dislikes all politicians and belongs to a cultlike commune. ''He is a product of war, a wounded and confused child,'' Mr. Baitz said.
 ''I wanted to write a jeremiad,'' he added. ''How treasonous this administration is just overtook me.'' JASON ZINOMAN

AJAX: I hate to break it to you, but your old gang -- ''killer humanists'' -- I believe you were called -- you think that this country would have you back.
BRICE: Excuse me, the United Nations has collapsed, Social Security is gone, people are fighting wars over clean water. When we were in office, we warned that in 20 years this country would be made marginal in terms of world markets. We predicted China. We predicted the European alliances -- Anglo, Franco, German, Russian.
AJAX: Dr. Brice, nobody listened to you. You were totally ineffective. And look what has happened to us. The dynasty of cowboys and corporate criminals . . .
BRICE: Have reduced the only great experiment in democracy to a nation bordering on medieval backwardness. This country will have me back and will welcome me with open arms.
AJAX: There's no real difference between your guys and the people in charge now.
BRICE: They are weak. We are not.
AJAX: Weak? These people are not weak.
BRICE: Martial strength is not true strength. Real strength is respecting the hearts and minds and differences of other cultures. Real strength is being brave enough to collaborate on new technologies and share control. It's never using concepts like crusade and evil to describe the other. Ajax, you can't possibly believe that going to war for fossil fuels and market pockets is strong. You're right, only the weak believe their god is the only god. Only the weak believe in isolationism and have xenophobic passion for national borders.
AJAX: I wish I could get behind all this. But I have no politics. They've always led to such disappointment.
BRICE: Are you insane? Look at you -- in rags and smoking pot and crack and heroin and shooting up and living in filth, a cultist: that's political. That's the politics of nihilism and letting it all pass by. Leave these people. Spend some time with me. Don't be brainwashed . . . into never trusting anything.

HEADLINE: The Portrait of a Family, as Painted at a Fraud Trial

BYLINE: By BARRY MEIER

 BODY:
WHILE testifying this month at the fraud trial of John J. Rigas and two of his sons, Timothy and Michael, in connection with the financial collapse of Adelphia Communications, a former executive of the company recalled an incident that revealed a lot about the relationship between the father and sons.
 That executive, James R. Brown, said he had spoken to Timothy J. Rigas, the company's chief financial officer, shortly after John Rigas, Adelphia's founder and chief executive, told investment bankers in 2002 that none of the Rigases had ever taken big salaries from the company or sold any of their stock holdings in it.
 Mr. Brown, Adelphia's former vice president for finance, said he ''told Tim that he really had to tell his father to stop making that speech, which I'd heard in various forms before, because people will either think he is dumb or lying.'' Timothy Rigas's reply, according to Mr. Brown: ''He said, 'I can't control my father.''' 
 Last week, after more than three months of testimony, the government's case against the Rigases and a fourth man, Michael C. Mulcahey, former assistant treasurer at Adelphia, began to draw to a close. In many ways, it has resembled other criminal cases against high-ranking corporate executives, with prosecutors and defense lawyers sparring over whether arcane accounting procedures were used to deceive investors and banks about the company's finances.
 But what has set this trial apart from all the others is the Rigas family dynamic. The most memorable moments so far -- like Timothy Rigas's reported comment -- illuminated issues that can affect any family-controlled business, from nepotism to personal use of corporate assets to the inability of a company's founder to give up control.
 There is plenty to suggest that family was everything in the insular world of the Rigases, for better and, if prosecutors are right, for worse. Both Michael, 50, and Timothy, 47, are unmarried and live in the same house as their father and mother in Coudersport, the small town in north-central Pennsylvania where Adelphia was based until it sought bankruptcy protection, when it moved its headquarters to Colorado.
 Family members also operated privately held cable companies that they financed with loans obtained through the public company -- a relationship that, in the differing views of defense lawyers and prosecutors, was either symbiotic or parasitic.
 It was in Coudersport, starting in the 1950's, that Mr. Rigas began to build Adelphia from the ground up. Several experts said that it was not unusual for a founder of a company to perceive it as his own, even after he reached retirement age or after it went public, as Adelphia did in 1986.
 ''It is hard for them to make the distinction between the business and themselves,'' said James Lea, a professor of family medicine at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who advises family businesses.
 That certainly seemed to be the case for John Rigas. According to testimony, he often took cash advances -- as much as $1 million a month -- from the company to pay for personal interests like operating an area farm that produced products like maple syrup. And while Mr. Rigas was known as a very generous contributor to community causes, he was not above hitting employees up for cash, according to court testimony. 
 Christopher Thurner, Mr. Rigas's personal accountant, testified that his boss asked him in 1995 for a $20,000 loan, saying he was short of cash. Moreover, Mr. Thurner, who earned about $40,000 a year, said Mr. Rigas encouraged him to take out a bank loan to get the money and offered to repay it only recently, after learning that Mr. Thurner would testify for the government.
 Timothy Rigas is also charged with tapping company funds to pay for extravagances like golf club memberships. According to testimony, he used the Adelphia jet to ferry around a friend, the Hollywood actress Peta Wilson; Adelphia funds also went to an interior design firm operated by John Rigas's wife, Doris, and helped pay for a film made by his daughter, Ellen Rigas-Venetis. (Mr. Rigas's wife, daughter and other son, James, have not been charged in the case.) 
 Such personal excess can often be cut short in companies with independent top executives or boards of directors. When Timothy Rigas took over as the de facto head of Adelphia after bladder cancer was diagnosed in his father in 1999, he tried to put his father on a shorter leash but failed, according to testimony.
 Wayne Rivers, the president of the Family Business Institute, a consulting firm in Raleigh, N.C., says that it takes tremendous courage for a son to face down his father in a business setting because of potential ripple effects in the family. ''It may not only affect the dad but also the relationship with his own mother,'' Mr. Rivers said.
 Whether the Rigas family had any such confrontations is not known. And it was while Timothy Rigas was ostensibly running the company that activities at issue in the trial took place.
 The Rigases and Mr. Mulcahey have all denied any wrongdoing. And Professor Lea, the family-business adviser, said it was possible that the Rigases did not perceive the use of Adelphia proceeds to finance their personal businesses or hobbies as crimes. ''To them, this probably did not appear like embezzlement or malfeasance of any kind,'' he said. ''It was more like you go to work in the store in the morning, you spend what you make and Adelphia was their family-owned store.''
 Throughout the trial, John Rigas and Timothy, his youngest son, have seemed upbeat. (The elder Mr. Rigas has often engaged reporters in light-hearted banter.) But on a day in early May, Michael J. Rigas, a slightly built, reticent man, failed to appear in Federal District Court in Manhattan, where the trial is taking place. 
 He had been hospitalized briefly over the preceding weekend and was still feeling disoriented on the next Monday, when the trial was set to resume, family associates said.
 The nature of his health problem was never disclosed, and he returned after a day's absence. But just before the weekend break, Mr. Brown, the former Adelphia executive who has pleaded guilty to fraud charges and is the government's most crucial witness, had taken the stand to begin his testimony.
 That day, Mr. Brown provided damaging testimony against all the Rigases, describing a variety of accounting gimmicks, sham transactions and phony financial reports that helped Adelphia mask the eroding financial performance that led to its filing for bankruptcy protection in June 2002. 
 Defense lawyers, who are likely to start their case this week, are expected to argue that the Rigases had planned all along to pay back the money they had borrowed from Adelphia. But even for a family as well off as the Rigases, that would not be easy. According to the last witness called by the government, the Rigases ran up a hefty tab at Adelphia: more than $2 billion.

HEADLINE: Buying Is a Snap. Knowing When to Sell Is Tough.

BYLINE: By PAUL J. LIM. 
Paul J. Lim is a financial writer at U.S. News & World Report. E-mail: fund@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
CONTRARY to popular belief, many investors did not lose money in the Internet meltdown because they had jumped into bed with high-risk stocks. It was because they had done so without figuring out how to end those relationships down the road. 
 That may sound unromantic, but investors need to be cold-hearted. Not having a sound ''sell'' strategy -- or any exit plan, for that matter -- was a big mistake for many people when the stock bubble burst and paper profits turned into huge losses. Investors need to take that lesson to heart, because the Nasdaq has entered what is starting to look like an all-too-familiar place. 
 After a strong rally last year, the Nasdaq composite index is in a correction. While it is too soon to predict a rerun of the 2000 market, which wiped out most of the gains of 1999, the Nasdaq has lost nearly 8 percent of its value since its January peak. 
 Even if history is repeating itself, this is no time to panic. In fact, times like these call for a rational investment approach that includes a disciplined plan for cutting one's losses. At least that is one way to interpret a new study of institutional money managers. 
 In the study, published this spring in The Journal of Portfolio Management, Christophe Faugere, Hany A. Shawky, and David M. Smith -- finance professors at the State University of New York at Albany -- examined the performance of money managers who oversee pension funds, endowments and high-net-worth accounts. Because institutional money managers often work under highly defined trading rules, the three professors were able to analyze these investors' performance based on their specific approaches to selling stocks. 
 The professors determined that during the bear market months from April 2000 to December 2002, investors who fared the best -- relative to their market benchmarks, at least -- were those with restrictive rules that did not allow much leeway for hanging onto stocks for emotional reasons. 
 For instance, more than a third of the 4,332 institutional money managers in the study relied primarily on a strategy called ''valuation level'' selling. That is a fancy way of saying that they sold stocks because they became too pricey, based on measures like earnings or book value. 
 The study's authors regard such a strategy as highly disciplined and objective. Managers who relied on this method outperformed their chosen benchmarks by 0.46 percentage points a month or 5.5 points a year, on average, during this period. 
 By comparison, institutional managers who relied on more flexible sell strategies -- requiring judgment calls on the health of a business -- fared worse. They beat their benchmarks by just 0.08 percentage points a month or just less than 1 point a year, on average, during the downturn, despite outperforming the more disciplined sellers during the roaring bull market of the late 1990's. 
 What does this mean for investors who may not have the skills or the resources of professional money managers?
 For starters, it is a reminder that some kind of selling discipline is better than none. ''Without any kind of strategy, emotions will come into play and emotions are almost always wrong,'' said Greg Forsythe, director of the equity model development team at Charles Schwab.
 Beyond that, said Mr. Shawky, director of SUNY's Center for Institutional Investment Management, ''discipline matters in down markets.'' 
 The notion of cutting losses may seem anathema in the world of long-term, buy-and-hold investing. But it makes sense to hold all your stocks forever only if every one of your ''buy'' decisions is perfect. And who can claim that?
 That is why it is important for investors to introduce discipline and structure to their investment plans. Here, we can take cues from some mutual fund managers:

SET TARGET PRICES -- Like many managers, Lanny Thorndike, lead manager of the Century Small Cap Select fund, judges how high each of his holdings may trade over the coming 12 months. This target is based in part on his judgment of how much others are willing to pay.
 Whenever a stock comes within 5 percent of his target price, Mr. Thorndike trims his position. In the first quarter, he sold shares of Sunrise Senior Living, the assisted-care company, as its price approached his target of $42. The stock fell to $30 a share in early May. He bought its stock again at $33; It now trades at $36.04. ''The sell discipline deserves more credit than the analysts or myself when it comes to keeping us out of trouble,'' he said.

SET A FLOOR -- ''The key to good investment results is to avoid the big loss,'' says Arieh Coll, manager of the Eaton Vance Growth fund.
 Academic research tells us that individual investors have a knack for hanging onto money-losing stocks. But one way that Mr. Coll makes sure that he does not ride his losers all the way down is by re-examining any holding that falls 15 percent below its recent peak. Although some managers sell at this point, using what are called stop loss orders, Mr. Coll reassesses his entire investment: he decides whether to dump the holding and take advantage of the tax loss, which he can use to offset other gains; to stand pat; or to buy more shares. 
 This forces him to deal with his laggards head-on, instead of avoiding the topic, as many investors do.

MAINTAIN DIVERSIFICATION CAPS -- Investors often benefit from cutting their losses and keeping their winners, but there are limits to the strategy. For example, if you let your winners grow too big, a diversified portfolio can quickly become too concentrated in a handful of stocks, raising the risk level.
 The managers of the Jensen Fund have a simple way of dealing with this. Whenever a stock in the $2.2 billion fund becomes more than 7.5 percent of the overall portfolio, the holding is trimmed, said Robert G. Millen, the fund's co-manager. 
 This approach keeps any single stock from having undue influence over the entire portfolio, and ensures that you take some profits along the way.

MAKE YOUR SELL STRATEGY WORK WITH YOUR BUY DISCIPLINE -- Whatever your approach, your sell discipline should reflect your buy strategy. Consider the Jensen Fund again. The only stocks that qualify for this large-cap growth portfolio are of companies that have produced returns on equity of 15 percent or more for 10 years in a row. Only about 120 companies in a universe of 10,000 meet that standard, Mr. Millen said.
 If a holding stumbles and breaks its string, it is kicked to the curb. That happened with Intel in the spring of 2001. The fund sold out of its position at about $31 a share, Mr. Millen said. By the summer of 2002, the stock sank as low as $15.
 ''Our preferred holding period for all our stocks is forever,'' he said. ''But in the real world, we know that doesn't happen.''

HEADLINE: '04 Graduates Learned Lesson In Practicality

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER and GREG WINTER; Eduardo Porter reported from Columbus, Ohio, for this article and Greg Winter from New York. Julie Flaherty, Laurie J. Flynn and Andrew Pollack contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: COLUMBUS, Ohio 

 BODY:
When Jim Moore visited Ohio State University this year on his annual recruiting trip for Ford Motor, he expected the usual barrage of questions from graduating seniors about salaries and vacations. 
 What Mr. Moore did not expect was a band of students armed with Wall Street analysts' reports. The job candidates came on like hard-nosed investors, peppering him with questions about the company's layoff prospects and its plans to combat Japanese competition in the full-size pickup market. 
 ''They had independent research, and they were trying to put me on the spot,'' said Mr. Moore, an Ohio State alumnus who has been recruiting here for almost a decade. ''This is a level of inquiry that I didn't use to see from a bachelor of business administration.'' 
 Thorough preparation for careers after college is shaping up as a defining characteristic of the class of 2004 -- not only at Ohio State, but at institutions big and small, public and private, around the country, according to national surveys and interviews with recruiters, administrators and students.
 This spring's graduates are among the first of what many call the ''millennial generation'' -- students born since 1982, who have come of age in the 21st century. And experts say their strategic, pragmatic approach to entering the work force speaks of a coming wave of adults bent on entering the mainstream -- and staying there. 
 ''A lot of the things that we associate with the generational break come from this graduating class,'' said Neil Howe, a co-author of the best-selling book ''Millennials Rising.''
 ''Millennials believe in preparation, in their track records,'' Mr. Howe said. ''They're thinking about what kinds of careers they're going to have.''
 Kristen Callaway, a 22-year-old business major at Ohio State who is set to graduate on June 13, focused on bolstering her resume with extracurricular activities. ''Recruiters are going to ask you, 'What did you do? What do you have to show for yourself?' '' Ms. Callaway said.
 On campuses, after two years of rising unemployment and dismal job prospects, company recruiters and university officials say seniors are more eager and better prepared for the job hunt than their predecessors. But there are longer-term trends at play, too. 
 The days are long gone when a college graduate could expect to go to work for a paternalistic employer and spend an entire career there, with a generous set of benefits and a comfortable pension upon retirement. Today, fears are growing about job instability and increasing competition, here and abroad, for the best white-collar positions. Rising health-care costs and increasingly pessimistic outlooks for pensions and Social Security have added to the general uncertainty.
 ''I need to have job security,'' said Carlos Maldonado, who graduated on Saturday from Fitchburg State College, in Massachusetts, with a degree in business management, and is still looking for work. ''I need to have something where I know I am not going to wake up in the morning and they say, 'We're going to cut your hours.' '' 
 The search for security, a hallmark of a generation unusually sheltered by highly involved baby boomer moms and dads, often translates into long-term planning, experts said. ''They are thinking beyond their first job,'' said Kathryn Johnson, executive director of the career center at Clarkson University in Potsdam, N.Y.
 Anita Choi will graduate on June 11 with a major in chemistry from the prestigious California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. She interviewed with some small biotechnology companies, but accepted a position based in San Diego with the drug giant Pfizer. Ms. Choi said that she might want to go to law or business school or get a graduate science degree, and a big employer like Pfizer would give her exposure to various disciplines. ''I wanted to find a place that was big enough that it had all those departments,'' she said.
 The class of 2004 entered college in the fall of 2000, at the end of an era. The dot-com bubble had burst a few months before, taking with it the fat salaries, signing bonuses and other accouterments of the Internet-driven hiring frenzy in the late 1990's. For the next three years, companies slashed campus recruitment and reduced entry-level salaries.
 But employment prospects have since improved. The unemployment rate among adults aged 20 to 24 declined to 9.2 percent in April, down from 10.0 percent in April of last year. For the first time since the Internet bust, corporations are expanding their college recruitment. A survey in March and April by the National Association of Colleges and Employers found that employers planned to hire 11.2 percent more members of the class of 2004 than they hired from the class of 2003.
 Yet two years of dismal job prospects, during a recession that cut about 2.7 million jobs from peak to trough, have imbued the current crop of seniors with an awareness of the economy's inherent instability and prompted them to be much more deliberate about their careers. A survey of college students conducted by the association earlier this year found that only slightly more than 10 percent of respondents ticked ''don't know what I want to do'' as their biggest obstacle to finding a job, compared with 22 percent in 2000.
 No college campus is representative of the entire nation, of course, but Ohio State is emblematic. It is one of the country's largest public universities, a baccalaureate factory in the heartland that in June will turn out nearly 7,400 new graduates from its total student body of 60,000. 
 One of those is Jared Wynand, a 23-year-old senior who says he is not ready to jump into the job market right away but instead wants to travel across South America. Yet even Mr. Wynand has a business plan: before he sets out on his travels, he plans to enroll in a course to teach English as a second language.
 As for the go-getters like Ms. Callaway, they were steeled by the bleak job outlook for those who graduated ahead of them. Even this year, ''of 20 graduating seniors in my sorority, only 2 have jobs'' she says. She spent much of her time in college building her resume -- interning at the student union, volunteering for Habitat for Humanity and attending a leadership program offered by Procter & Gamble.
 Ms. Callaway's determination paid off with a sales job at Rubbermaid, which comes with an annual salary of $37,000, a company car and a career path that could take her into marketing. ''My ideal would be to work for five years,'' she said, ''and then come back to Ohio State to get an M.B.A.''
 The university's officials say this year's graduates are the most prepared they have ever seen. An estimated 8.3 percent have double majors, up from 6.4 percent last year. And internships, long part of the career strategy of business majors, are now increasingly popular among students of the arts and sciences. 
 A survey in March by Experience Inc., a company that provides job search software for university careers offices, indicated that 64 percent of graduating students this year will have held at least one internship, 12 percent more than a year ago. And the number of students who have held at least three internships doubled from 2003.
 Prepared as they are, students also exhibit the caution and need for security that experts say are characteristic of this generation. In the most recent survey of students by the college and employers association, job stability was the second most important reason for choosing an employer, up from eighth two years ago. An item that two years ago ranked seventh -- ''integrity of organization in its dealings with employees'' -- now tops the list.
 ''They are making more educated decisions,'' said Rosemary Hill, director for career services at Ohio State's college of engineering. ''They are still thinking 'what's in it for me?,' but they have a more mature concept of this.''
 And they are demanding a payoff. As the cost of a college education rises, many of this year's graduates have had to work at least part time while in school and will still have loans to repay. ''I would not have been able to get through school without having a job,'' said Mandy Bischel, who has graduated as a pre-med student at the University of California, Berkeley and is applying to medical schools. While attending classes she worked as a chemistry lab assistant. As an in-state student, she paid about $6,000 a year in tuition, plus room, board and expenses, and she says she owes less than $10,000 in loans. 
 At Ohio State, where tuition is about $6,650 a year for in-state students and $16,640 for non-Ohioans, cost can also be a factor. ''College is an investment,'' said Dennis Di Tullio, the 22-year-old son of a firefighter from Youngstown, in northeastern Ohio. He started college with the class of 2004 but will take one more year to graduate because he has worked part time to pay his tuition. 
 Mr. Di Tullio already has his career mapped out, though. He says he would like to spend two years after graduation working for the international organization of his fraternity, Phi Gamma Delta, teaching in its leadership program at fraternity chapters in this country and Canada. After that, he would get both a law degree and an M.B.A. If all goes to plan, he would then spend a couple of years working as a trader on Wall Street, before starting a family -- assuming he has time to find a wife. 
 ''I need an overall direction, a framework,'' said Mr. Di Tullio. ''But I can also roll with the punches.''
 Some university officials fear that students' new pragmatism is detracting from their overall collegiate experience. ''Many students have less orientation towards reflection and more orientation towards resume-building than students a generation ago,'' said Lawrence H. Summers, the president of Harvard. ''I do worry. I do somehow wish that some students would smell the roses a little more and schedule fewer appointments.''
 Members of the millennial generation, though, say they have no choice but to focus on work. ''Jobs don't come to us anymore,'' said Ms. Choi, the Cal Tech grad. ''We have to go and find them.''

HEADLINE: Vision, Even Sightless, Helps Pick an Apartment

BYLINE: BY PENELOPE GREEN

 BODY:
ALEXANDRA ELMAN SINGLEVICH is still very good at shaking hands -- the trick, she said, is to stick your hand out first -- but her cane skills are wonky. She is a dealer in rare and fine wines, and her palate has only sharpened in the nine years since she lost her sight, her retinas destroyed by Type 1 diabetes. So has her memory. Still another of Ms. Singlevich's many talents is the way she ''gets'' a room, gleaned through a preternatural and innate sense of place.
 After moving three times in two years, Ms. Singlevich, 35, has polished this last skill to a fine, high gloss. She'll joke about finger marks she leaves on the walls of her new apartment, but a glance around its six rooms reveals only the sort of rolling halls and turn-of-the-century details -- pocket doors, two fireplaces, chair rails -- you would find in a midcareer Woody Allen movie.
 Indeed, this apartment, at 91st Street and Madison Avenue, which rents for a jaw-dropping $4,000 a month, is deep in Allen country. The building's undulating, articulated corner is as much of a Carnegie Hill landmark as the Jackson Hole restaurant beneath it or the little knots of Spence girls whirling on the sidewalk below in their plaids and seersucker. 
 Ms. Singlevich, a fiery woman with electric blue eyes and a stirring smile, has certainly earned it. Her first two moves were abrupt and reactive. She and her husband, Paul Singlevich, 37, an environmental consultant whose own spatial faculties are pretty spiffy, too, fell in love during the lease of her rapidly expiring sublet. A new lease, in a new sublet, remained out of reach, because of the glacial pace of a co-op board.
 ''Our sublet was up in February, and even though we'd prepared all our papers in early January, they wouldn't meet until late March,'' said Ms. Singlevich. Exasperated, the two camped in Mr. Singlevich's aunt's pool house in Ridgewood, N.J., for a month, and then bolted a year ago March into a rental in Edgewater, N.J. The rent was enticing -- $2,600 for a two-bedroom on the Hudson River -- but Edgewater was hardly a town. There were few sidewalks or services. 
 ''Imagine,'' said Ms. Singlevich, ''I am a blind New Yorker, and it's all about cars. After Christmas, I freaked out.'' 
 It was in the new year that Mr. and Ms. Singlevich developed their system, designed to check out an apartment quickly. After 20 or 30 showings, they were awfully good at it; their patience, however, had leaked away, drained by the Mamet-like double talk of the rental agents.
 ''Every agent lied,'' said Mr. Singlevich, a precise man deeply irritated by what he considered to be a consistent pattern of bait-and-switch tactics, as well as of square-footage inflation. With clients all over the city -- he advises or directs the cleanup of mold and asbestos, among other headline contaminants -- Mr. Singlevich is also a very busy man. ''You'd call on one apartment,'' he said, ''and they'd show you a different one. A no-fee apartment would magically have a fee. And a 1,200-square-foot space, when you walked it off, was 800 square feet.''
 Anyway, that system: the Singleviches would arrive together, holding hands, having left Hogan, Ms. Singlevich's soulful white Lab, in the car and exhorting him to stay put.
 ''You don't want to be turned away by a no-pet rule,'' she said. Some brokers never caught on to the fact that Ms. Singlevich, who always wore sunglasses to appointments, was seeing through her fingers. 
 MR. SINGLEVICH would narrate the space, its views and layout, its textures and idiosyncracies, and Ms. Singlevich would walk its perimeter. She would gauge size by sound and feel. ''You can tell just by standing still how large a room is,'' she explained.
 Ms. Singlevich has a penchant for long baths, so she would run her hands over the bathrooms, searching for the depth of their tubs. ''Usually I end up sticking my hand in the toilet,'' she said ruefully.
 The apartment at Madison and 91st was a plum, a by-the-way offering from the only broker ''who told the truth,'' said Ms. Singlevich. That broker, Douglas Hochlerin, whose company, Uptown Realty, specializes in rentals, had a listing for a live-and-work space on Fulton Street that petered out only because its renovation was too daunting. Ms. Singlevich has her own company, Marble Hill Cellars, which she runs from her home. But Mr. Hochlerin had something else: a Classic Six uptown, a formerly rent controlled apartment, a block away from the park. ''He was the only one who didn't waste our time,'' said Ms. Singlevich. And Mr. Hochlerin was one of the few brokers to whom Hogan was introduced.
 On their first appointment at 91st Street, Mr. Hochlerin said the other day, ''I couldn't get the door open. It was humiliating.''
 A few days later, they were in. Mr. Hochlerin was captivated by Ms. Singlevich. ''I'd pointed out how the threshold of the French doors was high on one side,'' he said. ''She felt it with her foot and the dog looked at it and that was that. I ended up tripping over it, but she never has.'' 
 Mr. Singlevich seems just as awed by his wife. ''She makes me see things I never would,'' he said. ''She has this amazing memory. For you or I, if we have things to do, we write them down, make a list. She does it in her head, and she'll make a joke about it, 'Tick tick tick,' she'll say, 'gotta get the dry cleaning.' '' 
 The two were fixed up by a friend, who just had a feeling about them. True, they were both diabetic, or used to be -- Ms. Singlevich had a kidney and pancreas transplant that cured her -- but there were other, weirder connections. During their first date, which lasted 36 hours, said Ms. Singlevich, they discovered that her aunt and his uncle had both worked on the Manhattan Project. ''How it came up, I can't tell you,'' said Ms. Singlevich, who in any case felt so comfortable with Mr. Singlevich that first day that she left Hogan at home.
 Losing your sight, said Ms. Singlevich in her matter-of-fact way, is like a death.
 ''You have to put aside a whole way of life,'' she said. ''You have to be reborn.'' Characteristically, she has made her own way, and her own rules. 
 ''I wasn't good with the cane,'' she said. ''I was always arcing it, and whatever it hit on the street, I'd reach down to touch. My mobility instructor was always shouting, 'Stop touching things!' '' 
 ''When anything agitated me before,'' she continued, ''I'd get in my car and drive. Now, I can go for a walk, sure. But it's not the same. I have a pilot's license, too, but that's the end of that. But you go on, things are still beautiful.'' Ms. Singlevich said she still goes to museums, which flummoxes some friends. 
 ''I see it through someone else's eyes,'' she explained. ''I match what they tell me to the pictures in my mind. I was lucky that I saw a lot of art when I was young.''
 What used to be automatic presented mind-snarling challenges. Dressing, for example. How, wondered Ms. Singlevich, a stylish woman with a keen eye for shoes, was she supposed to know what colors she was wearing, if she was wearing the black bra with the white shirt? Her solution was a tactile one, to slice the tags in patterns. One slice down the middle is a dark color, two slices are blue, burgundy is on the side, and so forth -- tick, tick, tick. Remember that Ms. Singlevich has a photographic memory.
 When she shops for clothes, she invites the salespeople: ''O.K., have fun,'' she'll tell them. When you can't see, she said with a grin, you have to trust people. Ms. Singlevich's humor has made her supple.
 She still watches television, and goes to the movies. ''It's not hard to tell what's going on,'' she said. ''C'mon, movies are so pat. You know what's going to happen anyway.''
 Ms. Singlevich's wine business is a wholesale one, which she is expanding behind some of those pocket doors. Its exclusive retailer will be a company run by her husband. Its name? Blind Wines.

HEADLINE: Teenage Job Seekers Face Slow Summer

BYLINE: By Betsy Cummings

 BODY:
Last summer Alexandra Baych, 16, had her dream job. She visited crime scenes. She interviewed witnesses. Her long-term goal of becoming a lawyer seemed more than promising under the tutelage of lawyers at the Bronx district attorney's office.
 This summer, however, is quite a different story. 
 She cannot reapply for her coveted internship. Out of 100 letters she had sent to law firms since last September asking for internships, she has received 12 letters and one phone call in response. They all said no. Undaunted, Ms. Baych, a member of the mock trial team at The Bronx High School of Science, where she is completing her junior year, approached corporate legal departments -- offering to intern for free -- with no luck. ''I've called law firms,'' she said. ''I've tried the M.T.A. and New Jersey Transit. Every place has lawyers. I'd do anything.'' 
 That may be, but, as Ms. Baych, now 17, is discovering, employment for teenagers is tough to find this summer. What has been considered as one of the tightest summer job markets for teenagers in recent years may be even more dire in New York City. 
 While unemployment figures fluctuate for adults, offering some hope for increasing job growth, the numbers remain bleak for teenagers. Nationally, only 42 percent of teenagers who are looking for work can expect to find it this summer, down from 52 percent in 2000, according to a recent study by the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University in Boston. 
 In New York the figures are even drearier. ''New York City's employment rate is always about 10 points below the rest of the state,'' said Andrew Sum, the center's director and the main author of the report released this month. In 2003 youth unemployment stood at 29 percent, three times that of adult workers, according to state labor statistics. 
 Other New York Labor Department statistics report that in April 2004 5,000 jobs were added to the city's hospitality and food industry and its retail sector -- markets where teenagers typically find summer jobs. But that does not necessarily mean more opportunities for younger workers, said James Brown, a labor market analyst with New York State's Department of Labor. ''New York has higher unemployment, and that's always made it tougher for teens because they're competing with more adults'' who are also seeking work, he said.
 Indeed, experts say unemployed adults, retirees vying for part-time work and college students unable to find jobs upon graduation are accepting positions normally filled by teenagers during the summer months. 
 After little luck with her job search thus far, Ms. Baych is considering less inspiring but more traditional teenage summer employment, like retail jobs in the mall. She is not optimistic. ''My friends have tried Pottery Barn, but those jobs are limited to college students, because they're older and supposedly more mature,'' Ms. Baych said. ''My friends tried to apply and were told they only take 18-year-olds.''
 The notion that younger workers are less responsible is largely unfounded, Mr. Sum said. Last summer, he said, 3.2 million American teenagers, or 20 percent of the population within that age group, was classified as unemployed -- those who are actively searching for work and want jobs. ''For those who ask, 'do kids really want to work?' we say, the pool classified as unemployed is huge,'' Mr. Sum said. But he admits it is a perception that some business owners are slow to relinquish.
 Frustrated, Ms. Baych searched for work online at HotJobs.com and SummerJobs.com, but found little available. A recent search on SummerJobs.com revealed only three listings within New York City. 
 Plying her teachers for job leads has been a dead end as well. Being a summer camp counselor is next on her list. Her options nearly exhausted, Ms. Baych has half-jokingly resigned herself to neighborhood babysitting jobs. Her father, she said, insists she has plenty of time to work later on in life, but Ms. Baych is not quite willing to adopt this viewpoint -- at least not yet. ''There is no job market,'' she said about this summer's employment prospects. ''It just depends on what you're willing to settle for.''

HEADLINE: What a Million Dollars Will Buy You

BYLINE: By CARIN RUBENSTEIN

 BODY:
THE house may be selling for more than $1 million, but it's still just a teardown.
 The four-bedroom house in Old Greenwich shares a driveway on a barely paved dead-end lane and sits on almost a half-acre. It has partial water views of Greenwich Cove, but the exterior is slightly mildewed and the concrete landings are crumbling. That hardly matters, though, since the $1.725 million dollar home is scheduled to be demolished.
 ''Sometimes they bring the wrecking ball to the closing,'' said John W.M. Cooke, only half joking, the listing agent for the house and manager of Merritt Associates, a real estate agency in Greenwich. 
 Right now, in this part of Connecticut, he said, ''One million dollars doesn't buy you much house. I've never seen it like this; it's like Monopoly money.''
 Mr. Cooke said one Greenwich home that recently sold for $1.4 million had some unusual qualities, but he admitted ''if you showed that million-dollar house to somebody in Iowa, they'd think you were crazy.'' 
 In a few other communities, including Darien and Westport, $1 million barely buys a starter home. Indeed, a growing number of home buyers in and around lower Fairfield County are entering the million-dollar home market, whether they expect to or not. 
 Ten years ago, $1 million bought a ''pretty high-end home, but $1 million now is pretty much entry level,'' said Mary Palmieri Gai, a broker at William Raveis in Westport. ''A million buys a tired house on half an acre or less that is waiting to be knocked down,'' she added.
 Charlotte Felt, manager of Kelly Associates Real Estate in Darien, said $1 million will buy a four-bedroom colonial style house on half an acre in Darien, while 10 years ago, that much money would have purchased a 16-room home on two acres.
 In fact, in the first quarter of 2004, 48 percent of the single-family homes sold in Darien went for more than $1 million, as did 66 percent of those sold in New Canaan. In fact, the average price of single-family homes exceeds $1 million in Greenwich, Westport, Darien and New Canaan. 
 In Greenwich, the average sale price of single family homes went over $1 million in 1997; the average price in the first quarter of 2004 was $2 million, according to Mr. Cooke. In New Canaan, too, the average price is now $1.9 million; the average price first topped $1 million there in 1999. In both Westport and Darien, the average price of single family homes hit the $1 million mark for the first time in 2002.
 Many real estate experts said high prices for single-family homes was due to extraordinarily low interest rates and a historically low level of inventory.
 In the early 1990's, not even 1 percent of homes in Fairfield County sold for $1 million or more, said Don Hull, president of the Connecticut Multiple Listing Service, which tracks housing prices in the Fairfield area, excluding Greenwich, Darien and New Canaan. But during the first quarter of 2004, 9 percent of the 1,326 single-family homes sold in 20 towns in Fairfield County went for at least $1 million, he said. With the addition of Greenwich, Darien and New Canaan, that figure rises to 27 percent. 
 ''Ten years ago, a $1 million house was very much a rarity,'' Mr. Hull said. But today, million-dollar plus prices no longer surprise him, he added.
 ''Real estate values double every seven years, and God hasn't created any more land, so you've got supply and demand,'' Mr. Hull said, in trying to explain the increase in seven-figure home prices.
 Yet the National Association of Realtors in Washington, which charts housing sales nationwide, does not even track homes that sell for more than $1 million, since ''it's fewer than 1 percent of transactions,'' said Walter Molony, a spokesman.
 With some notable exceptions. In several metropolitan areas nationwide, million dollar homes are becoming commonplace. 
 In Cambridge, Mass., for example, nearly 12 percent of single-family homes were valued at more than $1 million, as were 7 percent of those in San Francisco and 3 percent of those in Stamford, according to data drawn from the 2000 Census by Zhu Xiao Di, a research analyst at the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University. Although he did not examine figures for other parts of Connecticut, Mr. Di said that he is not surprised by the large number of million-dollar homes there. 
 In places where housing demand exceeds supply, and there is little open land to build more, ''one million dollars does not purchase a huge mansion, just a standard thing,'' he said. Mr. Di's study focused on owner-occupied single-family homes and thus excluded New York City's co-ops and condos. 
 The proportion of million dollar homes, however, varies widely across municipalities in southern Connecticut, as well as across the New York metropolitan region as a whole.
 In Greenwich, for instance, 64 percent of the single-family homes sold this year have been for more than $1 million, said Russell Pruner, a partner at Shore and Country Properties in Greenwich. Just across the New York State border, in Rye City, however, 38 percent of the homes sold in 2004 went for more than $1 million, according to George M. Stone, a co-owner of Julia B. Fee Real Estate in Rye. And across the Long Island Sound, in Nassau County, just 6 percent of home sales this year included those selling for more than $1 million, according to the Multiple Listing Service of Long Island.
 This wide disparity stems in part from the fact that housing prices have always varied from community to community, but also because of differences in property and income taxes, as well as perceptions about school districts and community prestige.
 In towns with a high proportion of million dollar homes, ''you pay for a certain exclusivity, and it's largely land values,'' said John Clapp, a professor of finance and real estate at the University of Connecticut who collects data on real estate statewide.
 ''You're paying for the neighborhood, the low tax rate, access to work places and recreation, and for the panache,'' he said. 
 Prices have risen in the New York metropolitan area substantially, ''especially in lower Fairfield County, and especially in terms of income,'' he said. Homes are becoming less affordable in the region as prices increase faster than income, added Mr. Clapp.
 Million dollar homes also come with a special Connecticut state tax burden.
 While sellers of homes priced below $800,000 pay a real estate conveyance tax of 0.5 percent to the state, those who sell a home for more pay a 1 percent tax, a levy that was enacted in 1989, according to Sarah Kaufman, spokeswoman for the Connecticut Department of Revenue Services in Hartford. 
 In fiscal 1997-1998, for instance, 1,934 homes in the state sold for more than $800,000, bringing in revenue of $34.1 million, Ms. Kaufman said. By fiscal 2002-2003, that number had increased to 2,740, bringing in $46.5 million.
 Many real estate agents in southern Connecticut said even $1 million is not really a standard by which a home becomes truly impressive.
 Homes that induce a mild ''wow,'' said Mrs. Gai, sell for at least $2.5 million, but even then, ''brokers have become so jaded that it's the land that makes them say 'wow' and not the house.'' 
 ''One million dollars buys a perfectly lovely house, and if that's your dream house, that's your mansion,'' said Barbara Cleary, owner of Barbara Cleary's Realty Guild in New Canaan. But still, she acknowledged that a dream house, or a true mansion, would probably be a newly constructed home that would be priced between $2.5 and $3 million.
 ''You can't say that $1 million makes a mansion, for sure,'' Mr. Clapp said.

HEADLINE: As for the Myth of Unlimited Cheap Housing, the Mortgage Has Come Due

BYLINE: By DEAN E. MURPHY

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS, May 29 

 BODY:
One lure that has made moving to southern Nevada so irresistible to so many striving Americans for so long -- the prospect of owning a bigger or cheaper house -- is disappearing.
 Las Vegas and its suburbs have been a housing bargain for more than three decades. But now houses here cost about as much as houses in Chicago, Denver or Baltimore. The median cost of a house here is 32 percent above the national median, according to a survey by the National Association of Realtors; until three years ago, houses here were cheaper than they were nationally. And the once ubiquitous dream home that sold for under $150,000 is getting hard to find. The median price of an existing house is $224,900, roughly the price of a new house. 
 ''Las Vegas was a small town, and suddenly it is becoming a big city and running into the big-city effect,'' said S. Lawrence Yun, a senior economist with the association. ''With more crowding, the value of the land gets pushed up.''
 The rising house prices may have helped turn back the tide of newcomers somewhat, with fewer people arriving here in 2003 than in 2002. Still, Nevada remains the fastest-growing state in the nation, but the demographic profile of the new arrivals is changing. Three of every five new residents now come from California, where housing prices still make those here seem like a bargain. 
 The price of houses in the Las Vegas area that sold in the first three months of this year rose by 31 percent compared with the same period last year, the second highest increase in the country, according to the Realtors association. New subdivisions here have waiting lists of six to nine months.
 ''We have never seen a market like this,'' said Lee K. Barrett, president of the Greater Las Vegas Association of Realtors. ''My concern as a businessman is we need to be working on affordable housing. We are seeing people priced out.''
 Though it looks as if the desert surrounding Las Vegas goes on forever, some builders here estimate that the available land for new housing will run out in 7 to 10 years. Most of the land is federally owned. In 1998, Congress authorized the sale of 55,000 acres, much of it at public auctions.
 As the market grows hotter, the price of the federal land goes up. The Bureau of Land Management will hold an auction on Wednesday that includes 1,940 acres in Henderson, a booming suburb. The land today is appraised at $250 million, or about $129,000 per acre. At the first bureau auction, in 1999, the land for sale was about 40 percent cheaper.

HEADLINE: The Big Name in Alabama's Primary Isn't on the Ballot

BYLINE: By SHAILA K. DEWAN

DATELINE: MONTGOMERY, Ala., May 27 

 BODY:
Roy S. Moore's coattails would not seem to have much to recommend them. He is not on any ballot. He is, by his own description, unemployed. He was booted from his last job, chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, by an ethics panel.
 But a group of candidates in the June 1 Republican primaries in Alabama is scrambling to show devotion to Mr. Moore, who became a hero to many Christian conservatives last year when he refused to remove a monument to the Ten Commandments from the rotunda of the state courthouse. Mr. Moore is appearing in other people's campaign commercials. He is quoted in their brochures. And on the trail, candidates wear glinting lapel pins in the shape of two stone tablets. 
 The primary can be viewed as a test of support for Mr. Moore, who has not ruled out a run for higher office. It is also part of a continuing struggle between traditional business-oriented conservatives and new religious conservatives for control of the state Republican Party here -- a struggle that is also being played out in other Southern states, said Anne Permaloff, a political science professor at Auburn University. 
 Whatever its significance, the invocation of Mr. Moore's name has injected new life into the normally staid contests for judiciary seats, where political opponents can generally muster no juicier issue than tort reform. The Roy Moore slate, as it is referred to by seemingly everyone but Roy Moore himself, includes three candidates for the Supreme Court, one for Congress and one for the Court of Civil Appeals. One former judge, Jerry Stokes, said he was so outraged by the ouster of Mr. Moore that he came out of retirement to run. ''I just decided people needed to step forward,'' he said.
 By linking themselves closely to Mr. Moore, the candidates are hoping to harness the outrage at his ejection from public office for, as they put it, ''acknowledging God.'' But Dr. Permaloff and other political analysts say Mr. Moore's popularity has declined since the public has come to better understand that in refusing to remove the monument that he installed, he defied an order from a federal court. 
 ''What the media first said was, 'This is a Ten Commandments issue,' and they said it over and over again,'' Dr. Permaloff said. ''Now people understand that the rule of law was not being accepted by a judge, and the whole system would fall if judges were allowed to do this.''
 Justice Jean Brown, who is being challenged by Mr. Moore's former legal adviser, has tried to capitalize on that distinction. After a federal court ordered that the monument be removed, she and the other justices said that although they believed the monument's display was proper, they had to comply with the federal court order. They voted unanimously to overrule Chief Justice Moore and have the monument removed. In a campaign commercial, Justice Brown shows a new courthouse exhibit that displays the Ten Commandments alongside other documents like the Magna Carta: a context that federal courts have said would be permissible. 
 ''Today I'm proud to say that the Ten Commandments are back in our courthouse,'' Justice Brown says in the television advertisement. ''It was the right thing to do, and we did it the right way.''
 Justice Brown's opponent, Tom Parker, has tried to portray that as hypocrisy. ''Who can Alabama conservatives trust?'' one of his commercials asks, showing a picture of Justice Brown. ''She removed the Ten Commandments, and insulted us with her politically correct, A.C.L.U.-approved display.''
 Perhaps hedging his bets, Mr. Moore has denied that there is any such thing as a Roy Moore slate and has been careful not to use the word ''endorse'' when describing his support for Mr. Parker, Mr. Stokes, and Pam Baschab, a Criminal Appeals Court judge, all of whom are running for seats on the Supreme Court. He has also said he supports his lawyer, Phillip Jauregui, who is challenging Spencer Bachus, a well-financed Republican congressman from Birmingham.
 ''I really don't think it's about me; it's about the issue,'' Mr. Moore said. ''I think that they use me to connect with the issue, but I think the real issue is the Ten Commandments.''
 Still, he chose the Wednesday before the primary to announce that he would appeal his removal from office to the United States Supreme Court. And while he had the attention of the state's political reporters, he denounced Justice Brown's commercial as ''disgusting'' and deceitful.
 The candidates are fighting to see who can move further to the right. ''When you're in Alabama, you're dealing with sort of shades of conservatives,'' said Justice Brown's campaign manager, Bill Smith. He describes his client, the only incumbent up for re-election this year, as a ''conservative Baptist Sunday school teacher.'' 
 ''They would have you think that it's all religious people versus business people, and nothing could be further from the truth,'' he said. 
 But the Business Council of Alabama, which supports Justice Brown, opposes the Moore slate. And the business council's traditional antagonists, the trial lawyers, have poured nearly $1 million into the coffers of the three Moore advocates running for the Supreme Court, said the Alabama Civil Justice Reform Committee, a group in favor of tort reform. The trial lawyers generally do not spend much money in Republican primaries. A spokesman for the Alabama Trial Lawyers Association did not return calls for comment. 
 Dr. Larry Powell, a professor at the University of Alabama, Birmingham who studies political campaigns, said that alliance was a marriage of convenience: the trial lawyers, he said, were spoilers trying to help candidates more likely to lose in the general election. And the public will not much care whom the candidates took money from, he said. ''It just cuts into their credibility in terms of their ideological purity within the party itself,'' he said.
 John W. Giles, president of the Christian Coalition of Alabama, said he was disappointed by the contributions. ''I have told them all along that if they take this money they are no longer the Judge Roy Moore slate; they will be publicized as the personal injury trial lawyers' slate,'' he said. ''These are very fine Christian people and they are my friends, but they're taking unclean money.''

HEADLINE: The Most Populous Nation Faces a Population Crisis

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN

DATELINE: BEIJING 

 BODY:
IT is tempting, looking at the locomotive that is the Chinese economy, to project its astounding rate of growth well into the future. China doubled its exports over the past five years, a faster pace of growth than the United States, Germany, Japan or Britain ever experienced in their economic boom times. By the time today's college graduating class reaches retirement age, China may be the world's largest economy.
 This is a consensus view, but some scholars are focusing on another statistic. Barring a radical shift in social policy, China is on course to age faster than any major country in history, as its median age soars from about 32 today to at least 44 in 2040. 
 China will mature more in the next generation than Europe has over the past century, according to data compiled by the United Nations. It will have to grapple with the same age-related fiscal, social and productivity challenges of countries with several times its per capita income. 
 Put another way, China will get old before it gets rich. 
 ''When people say things like we'll be richer than Japan or the United States, I never believe a single word,'' said Li Dongli, a demographer and sociologist at the China Population Development Research Center in Beijing. ''The burden of our population is too large.''
 Demography may be no surer predictor of destiny than trade data. But of the two momentous changes championed by Deng Xiaoping a quarter-century ago, coercive population controls and experiments with market economics, the jury is still out on which will do more to shape China's long-term potential.
 At least in terms of its original mission, limiting the runaway growth of China's population through the one-child policy instituted by the government in 1979 has been a success. Without it, China today would have a population of 1.6 billion instead of 1.3 billion.
 But rising longevity and falling fertility have created a new demographic time bomb. China's baby boomers are producing children at well below the rate needed to maintain the country's population, somewhere from 1.3 children to 1.8 children on average per mother. The so-called replacement rate, or the birthrate needed to keep the population steady, is on average 2.1 children per mother.
 Moreover, a traditional preference for male offspring, especially in the countryside, appears to have intensified as parents have fewer children over all. Selective-sex abortions are illegal but widespread. China today has the most sexually skewed adolescent and young adult populations in the world; boys outnumber girls at birth by a ratio of 118 to 100, according to China's 2000 census. The normal rate is 103 to 105 males for every 100 females.
 The impact of these problems is only beginning to be understood, but many who have studied the data agree that China's aging will lop multiple percentage points off its growth rate, beginning in the middle of the next decade. Some demographers and political scientists have also speculated that China's growing surplus of men will produce severe social stress, creating an army of bachelors that some believe could be more inclined to commit crimes or even wage wars than men in more sexually balanced societies.
 Just 10 years from now, as China's baby boomers begin to retire, the working-age population will begin to shrink, according to ''The Graying of the Middle Kingdom,'' a study by Richard Jackson and Neil Howard, both at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. For a country struggling with high unemployment and underemployment, the prospect of some tightening in the labor market seems welcome. But the decline is expected to accelerate, posing a potentially enormous challenge to a country that has built an economic miracle on cheap surplus labor.
 ''In my view this is the biggest challenge China faces in this century: figuring out how to deal with an aging society that is still at a low level of development,'' said Hu Angang, an economist at Qinghua University in Beijing. 
 Mr. Hu sees a triple threat -- a shrinking labor pool, competition for capital and rising taxes -- that may force China to rethink its development model altogether. Beijing now devotes only a small percentage of its spending to social welfare, and uses private savings held in the state-controlled banking system to invest heavily in factories, machinery, real estate and infrastructure.
 In the future, the government will either have to redirect spending to pensions and health care, or allow individuals to earn a better return on private retirement accounts by liberalizing capital markets. Either way, China will not be able to depend on state-controlled capital investment to stimulate its industrial economy indefinitely.
 The United States, Japan and Europe have all seen their birthrates decline. They have made the transition to older populations and more consumer-driven economies and continued to prosper, though at slower rates of growth. The difference for China is that it is aging at warp speed, leapfrogging the long period Western countries had to build middle-class societies. In fact, by 2040 it could have an older population than the United States, but with only one-third or one-fourth the average per capita income.
 ''We will have the social burden of a rich country and the income of a poor country,'' Mr. Hu said. ''No country has faced the same circumstances before.''
 Nor have many countries faced China's problem of producing too many men or too few women. Demographers do not have to guess about what will happen as the current generation grows up. Perhaps 15 percent of adult men will be unable to marry women in their age group, according to several Chinese and Western studies.
 The political scientists Valerie M. Hudson of Brigham Young University and Andrea M. den Boer of the University of Kent in England make a bold prediction about the consequences. They theorize in a recent book, ''Bare Branches: The Security Implications of Asia's Surplus Male Population,'' that China's ''surplus males'' could generate high rates of crime and social disorder. China, they write, may even become bent on war and conquest.
 ''The evidence is overwhelming that a large population of unmarried adult males is a risk factor for both crime and war,'' Ms. den Boer said in an interview. ''The fact that China is an authoritarian country is another risk factor.''
 Chinese experts say the prediction is outlandish, stereotyping men as natural criminals and warriors. Zhang Xiulan, a demographer at Beijing Normal University, argues that it also ignores the fact that while there will be more men than women, young people in general will be in short supply and high demand. Warring cultures tend to be youthful, not aging.
 ''We're going to have a situation in which every young man has to worry about caring for two parents and four grandparents,'' Ms. Zhang said. ''You cannot say they will be 'surplus' people we could freely sacrifice in war.''
 In fact, Mr. Hu and Ms. Zhang argue that China's overall demographic problem is still manageable, though only if it starts getting high-level attention. 
 Chinese authorities could raise the retirement age, which is 55 to 60 for professionals, and 50 to 55 for blue-collar workers -- lower than in most Western countries -- to prolong the productivity of the work force. More investment in education may allow China to climb the productivity chain faster so that it relies less on manual labor and youthful workers. Creating larger, better-regulated stock and bond markets and allowing higher returns on private savings could create a new financial industry, providing spinoff benefits for all parts of the economy, as well as a retirement cushion for today's workers.
 But the best and perhaps the only long-term palliative may be to ease the one-child policy and once again allow people the freedom to decide how many children they want. The notion is still sensitive but no longer heretical in China's policy circles.
 ''I can't see this happening for 5 or 10 years because the leaders are still very concerned about overpopulation and unemployment,'' Ms. Zhang said. ''But sooner or later, China will need more people.''

HEADLINE: A New Chapter for the Island's Tourism Bureau

BYLINE: By WARREN STRUGATCH

 BODY:
AS he prepares to step down next month after six and a half years at the helm of the Long Island Convention & Visitors Bureau, Michael V. Hollander leaves a tourism industry that is thriving as never before and at the same time is more fractionalized than it has been in a generation.
 Nationally, many travel businesses have never fully recovered from the economic effects of 9/11, but tourism on Long Island is a booming $4.3 billion industry, the Long Island Association said earlier this month. 
 New hotel construction has expanded the Island's room inventory by 10 percent since 1999, and several major older hotels have begun major renovations. Last year, despite soggy weather, occupancy rates approached 80 percent, the healthiest showing in four years. 
 New attractions have opened in both counties, and more are on the way. There has even been progress in landing the great white whale of Long Island tourism: establishing public restrooms and an information center accessible from the Long Island Expressway, a quest under way since the early 1970's and one that has frustrated a generation of tourism executives and promoters.
 For all that, Mr. Hollander, 53, leaves under something of a cloud: the Suffolk County comptroller is completing the county's second investigation of the bureau's finances in three years.
 Mr. Hollander said that in the last year he or staff members had attended conventions in places like Hawaii and Las Vegas as well as in Manhattan and other East Coast cities. Mr. Hollander defended the travel as essential to bringing in tourism business. 
 Earlier this spring, Mr. Hollander antagonized hotel and motel owners in Suffolk by refusing to speak out publicly against a proposed increase in the county tax on hotel rooms that would have quadrupled the rate from 0.75 percent to 3 percent, the same as Nassau's tax. The bill was withdrawn April 13.
 In announcing his resignation on May 20, just before the summer tourism season, Mr. Hollander said he had accepted an offer from Long Island Hotels, a small but growing chain based in Hauppauge, to become a partner. The new position would provide financial security, he said, and would allow him to cut back on his own travel. 
 The convention and visitors' bureau, which has its offices in Hauppauge, has a budget of about $2.3 million a year, the bulk of it from lodging taxes -- about $685,000 from Nassau and $960,000 from Suffolk -- and the rest from membership fees. Members include hotels, bus companies, vineyard owners and promotional agencies. 
 Mr. Hollander said that his foremost accomplishment was reorienting the bureau toward direct sales. It now books large meetings and events itself, instead of handling mainly advertising and promotion. He said that during his tenure revenues from major meetings and sports events had risen more than tenfold, to $52 million last year. 
 Mr. Hollander's departure has reopened old questions about the bureau's effectiveness and has given additional momentum to his Suffolk critics, some of whom are now suggesting that the county pull out of the bureau and promote tourism through its economic development office. That change would effectively disband the nonprofit bureau, which was formed in 1978.
 Cameron Alden, a Suffolk County legislator from Islip who has been one of Mr. Hollander's most vocal opponents, said he welcomed his resignation. ''I'd like to say to him, 'Show me what you did for our million dollars a year,''' Mr. Alden said. ''You'd need a magnifying glass to find the words Suffolk County'' on advertisements and promotions created by the bureau.
 In 2002, Mr. Alden's complaints about travel expenses and fiscal irregularities prompted a probe of the bureau by Suffolk County's Budget Review Office. It showed that the county had overpaid the bureau $300,000 to $400,000, Mr. Alden said.
 Mr. Hollander said he had told the county it was overpaying but was assured that the payment amount was appropriate. The county began recouping its overpayments in 2003 by reducing its monthly checks, Mr. Hollander said, causing the bureau to take out a bank loan to pay for advertising.
 Michael DeLuise, a vice president of Dowling College and a past chairman of the bureau, said: ''I'm disappointed that he's leaving, in that I thought he was doing a strong job. I wish he had stayed through the audit. There are explanations that are going to be needed.''
 Mr. Hollander replied: ''I told the executive committee that when they get the report, I will be here to answer it. I am not leaving Long Island.''
 Mr. Hollander's resignation leaves the bureau rudderless in a busy season. While most of its summer-oriented advertising and promotion campaigns are already booked, this is the time of year when the bureau sets to work building business for the so-called shoulder season in the fall, which increasingly rivals summer for peak travel. 
 Among the major tourist events coming up are the United States Open at the Shinnecock Hills Golf Club in June and the Hampton Classic equestrian competition in August. During the summer, tourism officials from throughout the New York City area will also be discussing how to position the region to compete for the 2012 Olympics. 
 Gloria Rocchio, the bureau's chairwoman and the president of the Ward Melville Heritage Fund, said that Mr. Hollander had done a good job and that the timing of his resignation did not cause undue concern. ''This is a routine audit of the bureau,'' she said. 
 Mr. Hollander said, ''We've been audited before, and we haven't had any terrible problems.'' 
 Mr. Alden, a Republican who is the chairman of the Legislature's consumer protection and government operations committee, has publicly complained about Mr. Hollander's salary, which, at $151,800, ranks among the highest for an official of a government or nonprofit agency on Long Island. Mr. Hollander's critics have also carped at his choice of official car -- a Jaguar -- and his track record of not attending tourism events in person, especially on weekends.
 Mr. DeLuise, who was the chairman of the bureau from 2002 through 2003, said that Mr. Hollander's promotional style might have alienated some people. ''Michael is very aggressive in what he does,'' Mr. DeLuise said. ''There are people who like him and people who don't. But on the board, 100 percent agree that he was the best for the job.''
 Mr. Hollander said that he was glad to be cutting his own travel, about 20,000 miles a year. ''I was on the East End twice in this week alone,'' he said last week. ''I'm looking forward to traveling less.''

HEADLINE: The Voters Say Enough, Already

BYLINE: By VIVIAN S. TOY

DATELINE: PLAINEDGE 

 BODY:
DOUGLAS PASCARELLA said he remembers the heavy pounding of his heart as he stood in the Plainedge High School gym waiting for school board election results on the night of May 18. He admitted that both he and his father, Peter, were pretty surprised when they learned that he had, indeed, won. Then they went home to celebrate with family and friends.
 ''Bagels, ice cream and soda,'' he recalled with a smile.
 Not exactly typical victory party fare, but then Mr. Pascarella wasn't exactly a typical school board candidate. An 18-year-old high school senior, Mr. Pascarella pulled an election lever for the first time in his life when he voted for himself for the school board. He defeated Dominic DiPrisco, a 48-year-old lawyer and three-year incumbent, by a vote of 1,360 to 998, and will take his seat on the governing body of the Plainedge school district only a few days after graduating from it. 
 A solid B student headed to Adelphi University in the fall, Mr. Pascarella served three years on the student council but was disqualified this year for putting up campaign posters and handing out Smarties. But for the school board race, he did things by the book.
 He campaigned door to door and handed out 2,500 flyers over the course of six weeks, more than double what his opponent managed. He also helped register fellow high school seniors who were eligible to vote, which he thinks gave him an easy 80 votes.
 His platform consisted of little more than his firm belief that the board needs a student voice. ''I wanted the school district to realize that there should be better representation for young people,'' he said.
 But given his margin of victory, it's safe to assume that he touched a chord beyond the youth contingent of the electorate. He achieved the perfect pitch he needed to win simply by being an alternative to the status quo and the budget and tax increases associated with it.
 So although Mr. Pascarella did not campaign with an anti-tax message, he has become a poster child for the voter anger against rising taxes that expressed itself at polling stations across Long Island this month. Nassau and Suffolk voters rejected 46 of 122 proposed school budgets, including Plainedge's $55.8 million budget, which included an 8.1 percent tax increase. Long Island's failure rate of nearly 40 percent set it apart from the rest of the state, where only about 15 percent of proposed school budgets were defeated.
 ''We're very concerned that while this year a sense of tax fatigue hit Long Island, next year it could spread to other parts of the state,'' said Robert Lowry, associate director of the New York State Council of School Superintendents, which represents about 700 school districts across the state. But he asserted that ''we were actually pleasantly surprised that things went as well as they did on the whole, given the circumstances that schools and taxpayers have to face.''
 Those circumstances include several budget factors beyond the control of local school districts, including no significant increase in state aid, hefty increases in pension and health insurance costs, and soaring gas and fuel prices.
 The fear that Long Island's voter anger may become contagious is compounded by the uncertainty over how state officials will deal with a court-ordered mandate for increased education aid to New York City. School officials on Long Island and in other relatively well-to-do areas fear that as the state devises a new school aid formula to meet a July 30 deadline, wealthier districts will be robbed of state funding to benefit poorer ones, thus pushing even more of the school funding burden on local taxpayers. ''There's definitely some trepidation about what the new formula could mean for school financing,'' Mr. Lowry said.
 Timothy G. Kremer, the executive director of New York State School Boards Association, said that while many factors probably contributed to the high rate of budget defeats on Long Island, concerns about the state aid formula ''probably played in the hearts and minds of voters there, because many of them feel that they're already doing their fair share to pay for education and they don't believe that New York City is.''
 These concerns likely weighed more heavily on Long Island voters because of the Island's proximity to the city and because residents have traditionally voted to tax themselves at relatively high rates to pay for what they consider a superior education, he said.
 ''People on Long Island, particularly those who commute to New York City, are much more attuned to the way things are funded than in other parts of the state,'' Mr. Kremer said. ''And people were saying, 'How long can we continue to raise our property taxes while we watch the school funding burden shift more and more from the state to the local districts?'''
 Mr. Lowry cited several factors that separate Long Island from most other districts upstate. They include rising enrollments that require increased spending, a continued cost-of-living disparity that drives up downstate costs and soaring property values on Long Island that have driven up local tax bills.
 On average, budget and tax increases also were higher on Long Island than elsewhere in the state. The average spending increase was 6.9 percent for schools in the state and 7.9 percent for Long Island, Mr. Lowry said. The average school tax increase was 8.7 percent for the state and 9.5 percent for Long Island, he added.
 Charles A. Fowler, superintendent of the Hewlett-Woodmere schools and president of the Nassau County Council of School Superintendents, said the sting of last fall's school tax bills, the first ones issued since the county's first comprehensive property revaluation in nearly 65 years, probably was at the heart of many of the budget defeats in the county. Twenty-two of the county's 56 school districts -- 39 percent -- suffered budget defeats.
 ''I suspect you could see the budget votes on Long Island as a thermometer of how people are feeling about the economy, state taxes, federal taxes and local taxes,'' Mr. Fowler said. ''It was more a generic expression of concern and this is the only place where the voter has the opportunity to express it.''
 John A. Richman, the Plainedge schools superintendent, said he had no doubt that general voter anger at rising taxes played a large role in his district's budget defeat and in the election of Mr. Pascarella.
 ''I think people were striking back at the way the system is and maybe it was a condemnation of the world around us,'' he said. ''There are a lot of things I can do, but I can't control $2-a-gallon gas prices, $4-a-gallon milk prices and the results of the property tax reassessment in Nassau County.''
 Mr. Pascarella also said that as he campaigned door to door, the most common complaint he heard from voters was the rate of increased costs and taxes. ''A lot of people said they want more for their money,'' he said.
 Other districts faced very local issues that turned voters against them. In Roslyn, voters turned down a budget for the first time in more than 20 years after a former assistant superintendent was accused of embezzling $1 million in school funds. In the Bellmore-Merrick high school district, voters approved the budget but ousted an incumbent board member. The district has been rocked by the hazing scandal in which four high school football players are accused of abusing younger teammates at a summer football camp. 
 Suffolk County districts did not have a property reassessment to contend with, but voters defeated school budgets at nearly the same rate as in Nassau -- 24 of the county's 66 budgets went down, a failure rate of 36 percent. Officials said Suffolk school districts were probably hurt by considerable increases in property values across the county.
 Jeannette Santos, president of the Nassau-Suffolk School Boards Association and a former Amityville school board trustee, gave her own home as an example. ''I bought my house 45 years ago for $19,500 and now it's worth $300,000,'' she said. ''That doesn't mean I have that much money in my pocket, but this is what I'm being taxed on.''
 Gary D. Bixhorn, the superintendent of the Eastern Suffolk Board of Cooperative Educational Services, said that housing prices have risen so significantly in recent years that it's not unusual to find some homes double what they were worth three to four years ago. 
 Many districts in eastern Suffolk are also different from districts in Nassau County because they are below the state average in terms of wealth and are therefore more dependent on state aid. At the same time, they are in a very high-cost region, he added, so when ''state aid doesn't keep up property taxpayers are forced to pick up a bigger share of the expenses than elsewhere in the state.''
 James H. Hunderfund, the superintendent of Commack public schools and president of the Suffolk County School Superintendents Association, said that his members told him many voters ''were almost apologetic about voting no. They would say they loved the schools and the kids, but they were just at the point of no return with paying these increases.''
 Commack voters narrowly approved a $116 million budget by a margin of 92 votes out of 5,100 cast. The district learned its lesson last year after suffering a budget defeat and having to put up its budget for a second vote to get voter approval, Dr. Hunderfund said. So this year, the district started public meetings and sending out budget updates to voters about six months ago.
 The district ultimately cut 12 teachers, eliminated its elementary summer school program and increased average class size by 2 students, to 26 in the elementary grades and to 29 in secondary schools. ''Even with all that, the budget was still an 8.9 percent increase,'' Dr. Hunderfund said, because of uncontrollable costs like contracted raises and increases in health insurance and pension costs.
 ''People think that districts are just making threats when they say that an austerity budget means cutting teachers, sacrificing programs and class sizes going through the roof,'' he said. ''But they're not threats. It's just telling people what reality will be.''
 In Plainedge, the school board voted last week to put up the same $55.8 million budget for a second vote on June 15. The board has also prepared an austerity budget in case voters reject the budget a second time.
 The decisions that had to be made were difficult ones, said Mr. Richman, the Plainedge superintendent. ''I think Doug is a nice kid,'' he said of the new school board member who will take office on July 1. ''But he's not prepared to make this level of decisions. He shouldn't be doing this on a lark.''
 Mr. DiPrisco, the school board member whom Mr. Pascarella unseated, agreed. ''I personally don't believe that any 18-year-old is able to face the challenges that face a school board,'' he said. ''Besides all the fiscal situations, there are a lot of sensitive issues regarding staff and students, a lot of things that I don't think an 18-year-old has the life experience to deal with.''
 Mr. Pascarella, who was voted Class Clown by his fellow seniors for the coming yearbook, said he knows that the administration and his future colleagues think he ran ''as a joke.'' But he insisted that simply wasn't the case. After a stint as an intern for Representative Peter T. King earlier this year, he said he decided that ''this is something I want to do in the future because I like to fight for people when something goes wrong and get them out of jams.''
 To prepare for his campaign, he found two 18-year-old politicians -- a city councilman in Ohio and a school board member in Maryland -- and he called them regularly for advice. He said he knows that his learning curve on the school board will be steep, but he plans to spend the summer studying up on school legislation and regulations.
 Mr. Pascarella also reached out to Assemblyman Thomas P. DiNapoli, who was the youngest person to hold public office in the state when he was elected to the Mineola school board in 1972 at age 18. Mr. DiNapoli said they never managed to hook up, though, ''because every time I called him back, he was out campaigning.''
 Mr. DiNapoli served on the Mineola school board for 10 years, eventually becoming the school board president. He said he too was received with less than open arms when he was first elected, particularly since he was rebellious enough to attend board meetings in blue jeans.
 ''My first year was very tough,'' he said. ''They were very patronizing to me and it was a little tense, but I was determined not to be an obstructionist or to create a revolution. I just wanted to present a different viewpoint.''
 Mr. DiNapoli said he would advise Mr. Pascarella to bear in mind that ''as a consumer of the school system, he has some inside knowledge, but he's got to realize that he can't try to speak for students anymore because he won't be one himself once he takes office and he has to represent a much broader constituency.''
 And as for Mr. Pascarella's new colleagues, Mr. DiNapoli said, ''They should keep in mind that part of the diversity of a community should include our younger citizens and he's got a real insider's point of view that nobody on the board has. They would be wise to respect the voters' wishes and give him an even chance.''

HEADLINE: Once Down and Out, Now Cool, and Hot

BYLINE: By JULIA LAWLOR

 BODY:
IN the early 80's, when the director Woody Allen filmed the movie ''The Purple Rose of Cairo'' on Piermont's main street, the joke was that the village was so shabby, it had to be spiffed up to approximate the look of a 1930's-era Depression town. 
 But the down-and-out days in Piermont are long gone. This Rockland County river village, a former working-class community along the Hudson River just 11 miles north of the George Washington Bridge, shows signs of advanced gentrification: boutiques, art galleries, cafes and upscale restaurants line its downtown area on Piermont Avenue. Traffic jams and real estate bidding wars are common, as are $1 million condos. 
 Many of Piermont's old homes -- built in the 18th and 19th centuries on small lots -- have been renovated, and there is virtually no more vacant land to develop. Steep wooded hills that rise above the river are dotted with houses that have stunning views of the Hudson, which is about three miles wide here. ''A river view can add anywhere from $50,000 to $150,000 to the price of a house,'' said Frank Mancione, manager of Prudential Rand Realty in Nyack. He noted an increase in city dwellers moving to Piermont after the World Trade Center attack and said the trend continued as rapidly rising real estate values in the city priced more people out of the market. 
 Marc Farre, a musician who moved to Piermont two and a half years ago with his wife, Viviane, a fashion designer, said, ''We're part of the great wave of Manhattanites who couldn't afford more than a one-bedroom apartment in the city.'' They bought a house for $481,000 along Sparkill Creek that is surrounded by decks and gardens. It is six times the size of the 390-square-foot apartment they rented for $2,100 a month in the West Village. 
 Every morning, Mr. Farre jogs by the Piermont Marsh, a protected wetlands area that serves as a feeding ground for birds and other wildlife, and out onto a mile-long pier that extends into the river. ''I'm in absolute heaven,'' he said. 
 In Piermont, housing prices have risen 8 to 10 percent a year for the last three years, said Nancy Swaab, associate broker for Mason Samett Associates Inc. in Tappan, N.Y. ''What attracts people to Piermont is a love of the river and the proximity to the city,'' Ms. Swaab said. Depending on traffic, the drive to Manhattan can take anywhere from 40 minutes to an hour and a half. There is also bus service from Piermont to the Port Authority and train service from Pearl River, a 10-minute drive to the west. 
 Piermont has a wide range of housing styles, including modern condominiums in Piermont Landing, a 150-unit riverfront complex built in the late 1980's and 1990's on the site of a former paper factory; stone houses built in the 1700's; Greek Revival houses from the mid-1800's; and Victorians. There are also ranches, split-levels and contemporaries. Prices for single-family homes range from the high $300,000's for a small ranch house without river views to more than $1 million for larger historic homes and homes along the river. 
 At Piermont Landing, prices for one-bedroom condos with river views start at $350,000 to $400,000; larger units facing the river range from $800,000 to $1.3 million. 
 Despite the six-figure prices, Piermont has not lost its funky old-fashioned feel. At the Turning Point Restaurant and Cafe, you can see performances by folk singers from the 60's like Tom Rush and Melanie. There are no chain stores like the Gap or Starbucks. Until recently, there was no A.T.M., and when the bank finally installed one, said Ned Kelly, owner of a wine bar-restaurant and a home and garden store in the village, ''it kept running out of money.'' 
 The population (just over 2,000) is an eclectic mix of retirees, young families, artists, musicians, filmmakers and screenwriters. The actors Alan Ruck (of ''Spin City'') and William Hurt live in Piermont, and there have been frequent sightings of Bill Murray, Ellen Burstyn, Al Pacino, Rosie O'Donnell and the singer Bjork, all of whom live nearby but not in the village. 
 The Dutch settled in Piermont in the late 17th century, when the area was referred to as the ''Slote'' (the Dutch word for ''ditch,'' the name then used for Sparkill Creek) and also as ''Tappan Landing.'' Its first economic boom came in 1838, when it was designated as the southern terminus for the New York and Erie Railroad. A pier was built stretching 4,000 feet into the Hudson so that freight and passengers could be loaded onto ships, and the railroad's founder, Eleazor Lord, renamed the village ''Piermont.'' The rail line was finally completed to Dunkirk in 1851, but by 1863 most passenger and freight trains began using a terminal in Jersey City. Piermont then fell into decline.
 In the early 1900's, a resort, Fort Comfort, briefly revived commerce with an ice cream parlor, bathing pavilions and casino along the river. Around that time the paper mills arrived; they provided jobs for 75 years before closing in the early 1980's.
 PIERMONTERS today are keenly aware of any changes in their village, and many resist what others might see as the inevitable march of progress. For instance, the big news at the moment is the change in ownership of Piermont Community Market, the village's only grocery store. When new owners modernized by replacing the rickety shelving and painted plywood floors, some villagers grumbled that the place had lost its charm. 
 ''We are struggling to hold back the pressure to make this into a Sausalito-type place,'' said Margaret Grace, a member of the Village Board, who has lived in Piermont for 22 years. ''None of us are happy about property values going up and up and up. It means taxes are going up, and our kids won't be able to live here.'' 
 Families with young children move to Piermont in part because of the reputation of the South Orangetown School District, which also includes Palisades, Tappan, Sparkill, Orangeburg, Blauvelt and Grandview. Schools emphasize the arts and music as well as academics, according to Jane Sandbank, assistant superintendent for curriculum and instruction. ''We look at more than just test scores,'' Dr. Sandbank said. 
 Instead of neighborhood schools, all students in the district attend the same three elementary schools -- spending kindergarten and first grade in in Tappan, second and third grades in Piermont and fourth and fifth in Blauvelt. The middle school in Blauvelt serves Grades 6 to 8 and and Tappan Zee High School in Orangeburg serves Grades 9 to 12.
 The district's elementary schools were named among the most improved in the state by the New York Department of Education, based on the increase in test scores among fourth graders from 1999 to 2003.
 Among fourth graders last year, 97 percent met or exceeded standards on state assessment tests in math, 88 percent were at or above state standards in English language arts. That compares with a state average of 79 percent in math and 64 percent in English language arts.
 Seventy-nine percent of eighth graders scored at or above state standards in math, 66 percent scored at or above in English language arts -- compared with state averages of 51 percent in math and 45 percent in English language arts. 
 At Tappan Zee High School, 71 percent of last year's senior class of 228 students attended four-year colleges, and 26 percent attended two-year colleges. On the SAT reasoning tests last year, students scored 538 in the verbal test and 568 in math, compared with state averages of 496 in verbal and 510 in math. The high school offers 17 Advanced Placement courses and is known for its arts and music programs. Last year, the high school concert choir and chamber orchestra performed at Carnegie Hall. 
 Dr. Sandbank said that rising enrollment had led to a space shortage and that the district plans to propose a bond issue this fall for building additions to all schools. Last year, a $30.5 million bond for the same purpose was defeated by 57 votes. 
 Most Piermont residents send their children to public schools, but there are some private and parochial schools nearby. The Dwight-Englewood School in Englewood, N.J., is an independent day school for preschool through 12th grade. Tuition ranges from $12,000 in preschool to $20,795 for Grades 7 through 12. St. Catharine of Alexandria School in Blauvelt is a Roman Catholic school for prekindergarten through eighth grade. Tuition is $2,600 a year. 
 ONCE their children are out of school, many empty-nesters end up staying in Piermont. The mayor, Edward Traynor, and his wife have lived in Piermont for 22 years and raised their three sons here. Four years ago, he made a wish list for his ideal retirement spot -- a place with good restaurants where he could walk to buy a newspaper, ride bikes and enjoy nature. He started looking in Pennsylvania, Delaware, the Hamptons and Connecticut.
 ''One day,'' he recalls, ''I said to my wife, 'Piermont has all these things.' '' The Traynors ended their search and bought a smaller house downtown. 
 The crowds on weekends, especially in the summer, can shatter the serenity of Piermont and set long-time residents on edge. The village has become a popular destination for bicyclists coming from the George Washington Bridge and heading north to Nyack. Although there are signs warning of fines for failing to ride single file, they are not always heeded. ''It can get noisy, with the people on the river, the rowing clubs going by and all the bikers on the road,'' Ms. Grace said. ''They ride in packs, and the cars come to a standstill. Some people think it's nice we're a destination for cyclists. It irritates the heck out of most.'' 
 But Barbara Moore and her husband, Bob, who moved to Piermont in March from Valley Cottage in Rockland County, are so thrilled with their river view that they hardly notice the noise. ''We love the sun coming up and the sparkle on the river,'' Mrs. Moore said. ''It's wonderful. We can't put our blinds down.''

According to ''Piermont: Three Centuries,'' a history written by a resident, Julie Jackson, there were oysters, sturgeon, striped bass, blue crabs and shad in abundance. Oyster gathering and sturgeon fishing were thriving industries at the time, she wrote, and sturgeon was so plentiful it was called ''Albany beef.'' Fishing for striped bass, blue crab and shad continued until the 1970's, when PCB's from industry upstate polluted the river. While PCB levels have been sharply reduced, the fishing industry has never recovered. A reminder of the days when fishing thrived, a 210-pound sturgeon taken from the river in 1974, is stuffed and on display at Cornetta's Restaurant on Piermont's waterfront.Map of New York State highlighting Piermont.

HEADLINE: Wall Street Keeps an Eye On Jobs Data

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
For weeks, the stock market has been fretting that the Federal Reserve will raise short-term interest rates.
 The Fed won't hold its next rate-setting meeting until late June, but the decision to move or stand pat on rates may be determined by what happens on Friday, when employment figures for May are released.
 As of late last week, the consensus estimate among economists was that 225,000 jobs were added this month. That would be down from a 288,000 increase initially reported for April, but better than tepid gains earlier in the recovery. 
 Usually, big employment gains help the stock market because they suggest a healthy economy. But Wall Street may be cheering for a less-than-robust figure this time, analysts said. A number that is much weaker than expected could persuade the Fed to postpone a rate increase.
 ''The longer the Fed dogs stay penned up, the better it is for the stock market, assuming the economy is growing,'' said Paul Kasriel, director of economic research at the Northern Trust Company. But Fed inaction is unlikely, Mr. Kasriel said. 
 ''If the number is somewhere around the consensus estimate range of 175,000 to 250,000, I think they will decide to move,'' he said. 
 Short-term rates are as low as they have been in 40 years, but many people are worried about what will happen next.
 ''When the Fed starts to tighten, you don't know where they are going to stop, and that affects price-to-earnings ratios,'' he said. ''And I suspect people think earnings growth has about peaked.'' 
 BUY ON THE RUMOR Biotech investors will be hungry for news this week, the final trading days before the start of the year's biggest convocation of cancer specialists.
 On Saturday, more than 25,000 scientists and oncologists from around the world will gather in New Orleans for the start of the 40th annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology. Kris H. Jenner, a doctor who manages the $1.25 billion T. Rowe Price Health Sciences fund, says presentations by OSI Pharmaceuticals, ImClone Systems, Genentech and Onyx Pharmaceuticals may be of particular interest to investors. 
 All four companies have developed cancer drugs. And there is a growing recognition that some, including Erbitux, ImClone's drug for colon cancer, may have applications for a variety of cancers. The drug, whose rejection by regulators in 2001 prompted the ImClone stock selloff that was at issue in the Martha Stewart case, has commercial promise, Dr. Jenner said.
 ''There is a growing recognition that Erbitux will be a blockbuster drug'' with sales of $1 billion or more, he said. ''I think its utility will go far beyond'' the treatment for which it has already been approved, he added.
 At the convention, he said, ImClone is expected to present ''preliminary information'' on broader uses for Erbitux.

HEADLINE: Four Museums Get a Second Life

BYLINE: By DICK AHLES

 BODY:
FOUR small, but historically significant Connecticut museums, closed by the state since the 2002 budget crisis, will reopen in June. They are the New-Gate Prison and Copper Mine in East Granby, the Henry Whitfield House in Guilford, the Prudence Crandall Museum in Canterbury and the Sloane-Stanley Museum in Kent.
 The four will begin operating Wednesdays through Sundays as soon as staffing requirements are met, said Karen Peterson, the director of all four museums. New-Gate is filling five positions and each of the others is hiring one staff member. 
 In addition to restoring operating funds, the General Assembly has appropriated $3 million, which must be approved by the Bond Commission, for deferred maintenance and renovations at the sites. Ms. Peterson said most of the work will be at New-Gate and will include rebuilding an above-ground, four-story cell block partly destroyed by a fire a century ago and safety improvements in the original copper mine/prison. About $500,000 will be set aside for restoration grants for other historic buildings in the state's cities and towns.
 The state's investment in New-Gate comes after residents of the East Granby area and other supporters tried to privatize the old prison site when the state closed it. A bill was introduced by Representative Richard Ferrari of East Granby to have the state shift control to a nonprofit group. It resulted in a compromise that calls for a one-year study of the feasibility of having a public-private partnership operate the prison. The year before it closed, the 19,000 visitors New-Gate attracted more than quadrupled the town's year-round population and privatization advocates said closing the attraction hurt the town economically. 
 New-Gate traces its history to a copper mine established in 1702 in what was then part of Simsbury. The mine was converted to a prison by the colonial legislature in 1773 and during the Revolutionary War, it housed Tories and other British loyalists as well as criminals in the 16-square-foot mine, 20 feet underground. It became the nation's first state prison and was operated as a prison until 1826 when the inmates were moved to a new prison in Wethersfield.
 Older than New-Gate, the 1639 Henry Whitfield House near the town green in Guilford is the oldest house in Connecticut and also the oldest stone house in New England. It is one of only three existing masonry houses from what is known as the First Period of American architecture. The others are in Newbury, Mass., and Surry County, Va. The house was originally owned by the Rev. Henry Whitfield, one of the town's Puritan founders. It was bought by the state in 1900. 
 The Prudence Crandall Museum was the home of the young teacher who was designated the official state heroine by the General Assembly in 1995 for her courageous attempt to run an academy for young, black girls in her home in the face of threats, harassment and arrests. The school met strong opposition not only in Canterbury and prompted the passage of the state's so-called ''Black Law,'' which barred the establishment of schools for blacks without the approval of the town. 
 On Sept. 8, 1834, 17 months after the school was opened, a mob attacked the building with lead pipes and clubs, smashed windows and ransacked the ground floor. Fearing for the lives of her 20 students, Ms. Crandall closed the school, left Connecticut and never returned. The house was bought by the state in 1969 and opened as a museum in 1984. 
 To mark the museum's 20th anniversary and the 50th anniversary of the landmark Supreme Court school segregation decision, Brown v. Board of Education, the Commission on Culture and Tourism, which oversees the museums, has just published ''To All on Equal Terms: The Life and Legacy of Prudence Crandall'' by Diana Ross McCain of Deep River.
 Another Connecticut author is celebrated in the fourth museum getting new life, the Sloane-Stanley Museum in Kent. The Sloane of Sloane- Stanley is the late artist and writer Eric Sloane, whose collection of early American tools is the museum's principal attraction. (Stanley is the New Britain based hardware company, Stanley Works, which donated the land for the museum and to exhibit its collection of early hand tools.) 
 Mr. Sloane's emphasis as both artist and writer was Americana. His books bore titles like ''American Yesterday,'' ''American Barns and Covered Bridges,'' ''Cracker Barrel'' and ''The Diary of an Early American Boy,'' which inspired a replica of a frontier homestead at the museum.
 In the museum lobby, a diorama shows the Kent Iron Furnace, which operated on the site from 1826 to the late 1890's and whose ruins are just below the museum. Its partial restoration is planned.
 Of the four museums, the Connecticut state historian Christopher Collier calls the Sloane-Stanley his favorite. ''Wandering through that place calls up great feelings of nostalgia,'' said Mr. Collier, ''and that is exactly what it is intended to do.''
 He is pleased to have the museums back in business. ''I thought closing them was a terrible disservice to the citizens of Connecticut and to the people who day trip here from neighboring states,'' he said. 
 He also thought it was a big mistake because, ''Aside from casinos, Connecticut's major tourist attractions are the heritage destinations that examine our past.''

HEADLINE: This Year, a Dark Cloud Hangs Over the Carefree Season

BYLINE: By NEIL GENZLINGER

 BODY:
THE carefree season is upon us, but in New Jersey and environs it arrives this year with an ominous aura. 
 A motion sensor discovered weeks ago in a Philadelphia rail yard, though it turned out to be harmless, raised concerns about bombings like the ones in Madrid in March. In New York the transit agency, wary of terrorism, has proposed a ban on photography and videotaping in the subway. And the other day New Jersey's Office of Counterterrorism said it planned to offer training in an area that many thought this country would never have to worry about: identifying and dealing with suicide bombers. 
 Suddenly, $2-a-gallon gas seems like the least significant phenomenon intruding on the New Jersey summer. That problems that once seemed worlds away are now camped out on the doorstep comes as no surprise to Stephen Segaller of Princeton, executive producer of ''Wide Angle,'' an acclaimed PBS series of documentary films dealing with issues like rebuilding in Afghanistan and black economic empowerment in South Africa. By coincidence, ''Wide Angle'' is about to begin its third season with a segment called ''Suicide Bombers.''
 The film consists primarily of stark interviews with would-be suicide bombers and bomb-makers whose missions failed and who are now in Israeli prisons. It has its premiere July 1, not long after the state's Office of Counterterrorism holds training sessions for local law enforcement personnel in spotting and thwarting suicide bombers. The state police are planning similar training. 
 Roger Shatzkin, spokesman for the Office of Counterterrorism, said the training did not result from a specific threat, but from the knowledge that New Jersey, with its rail system, buses and public gatherings, might beckon those bent on destructive suicide.
 ''The unfortunate calculus is that the world is somewhat of a terrorism laboratory,'' Mr. Shatzkin said, ''and anything that's going to develop anywhere else in the world is importable here.'' 
 A chilling segment in the ''Wide Angle'' film hints at just what the New Jersey authorities could be up against. A bomb-maker matter-of-factly describes the shift from bombs-in-bags to bombs-in-belts.
 ''The big advantage of a belt over a bag is that it's invisible,'' the man says. ''One wears it under his clothes and it's not seen. It makes it a lot safer to get to the target.''
 Even more bluntly, as if teaching Suicide Bombing 101, he says: ''If he's wearing the belt around his stomach, then he should aim to have the largest number of people in front of him. If he's wearing the belt around his back, then he should aim to have the largest number of people behind him.''
 Though Mr. Segaller said the combination of despair and religious fervor that foments suicide bombings in the Middle East was not endemic in the United States, those who think it can't happen here are forgetting something. ''The World Trade Center attack on 9/11 was a multiple suicide bombing,'' he said. ''The number of casualties was so grotesque that in our consciousness it dwarfs the memory that 19 people voluntarily got onto those planes and took command of them and killed themselves in the act. In that sense it was the most effective and murderous case of suicide bombing of them all, and it did happen here.''
 Riding New Jersey Transit or gathering in public places has carried an underlying wariness since that day, and all the more so since the Madrid bombings. It is a mind-set that Mr. Segaller, who has worked all over the world and wrote a prescient book on terrorism two decades ago, is familiar with. 
 ''I grew up in Britain, and in the very late 60's and all through the 70's in London people were always looking to see if there was a bag left on the Underground or at a bus station,'' he said. ''In London it's almost impossible to find a trash can on the street to throw away your candy bar wrapper because the I.R.A. used to put bombs in garbage cans.''
 Suicide bombings are, he said, more vexing than the I.R.A.-style bombings because so much of conventional law enforcement depends on the criminals' not wanting to get caught or killed. That the notion of self-destruction for a cause may seem unfathomable to us is not the point. ''It doesn't matter whether it makes sense to me,'' Mr. Segaller said. ''It only matters whether it makes sense to them.''
 The ''Wide Angle'' series, he said, seeks to show the individuals behind the globe's hopes and horrors, and how they are connected even to those of us in relatively complacent New Jersey.
 ''In one of the taglines we use, we say, 'The world has never been closer,''' he said.
 Or, perhaps, scarier.

HEADLINE: Produce Center Sought, State Is Negotiable

BYLINE: By SUSAN WARNER

 BODY:
FOR more than a year, New Jersey officials have sought to lure disgruntled regional produce merchants away from their distribution center in Philadelphia.
 In this latest iteration of a familiar courting process, the state has offered to build a $94.9 million wholesale produce center in Camden, near a shipping terminal by the foot of the Walt Whitman Bridge, a mere three miles from the merchants' current quarters. The state has agreed to borrow funds to build the center, a sprawling warehouse on a 46-acre complex.
 Governor McGreevey even phoned the merchants at an April meeting, making a personal appeal to consider the move. Now the state is done sweetening the deal: officials have given the merchants a new offer, a June 5 deadline to decide what to do. 
 The state -- long a bargaining chip for tenants across the Delaware River to the south and the Hudson River to the north who are considering a move -- is looking to win this latest round and score the produce merchants and the 1,100 jobs and tax revenue that would come with them. The center would complement a broader $175 million package in infrastructure improvements meant to revitalize Camden. 
 ''This is an important cog in the wheel of Camden's redevelopment,'' said John E. McCormac, the New Jersey treasurer, who has been in talks with the merchants. ''It's a perfect opportunity for the city's redevelopment.''
 The merchants have responded to prodding from New Jersey, voting to move across the river, but only if Philadelphia does not offer them a better deal before the deadline. They want to leave a 45-year-old distribution center near the sports complex in South Philadelphia that was built to consolidate the region's food markets. The center sells $1.1 billion in goods each year to restaurants and grocers. 
 Now, the produce merchants say, the buildings are outdated and cannot keep food cold. The market also leaves them ill equipped to meet new federal regulations to safeguard against biological threats, they contend. The merchants are ready for a move, regardless of which side of the state line they end up on. 
 ''The market needs to be responsive to health regulations and quality assurance,'' said Joe Procacci, founder of Procacci Brothers, the produce market's largest merchant. ''It's going to require a lot better access to rail,'' he said, adding that the merchants wanted ''a modern facility.'' Mr. Procacci said that the 24-acre center in Philadelphia was so small that he and other merchants were trucking in produce from satellite warehouses. 
 Other merchants agree. The Philadelphia Regional Produce Terminal, the merchants' association, said in a statement, ''With more product from around the world available in greater quantities, our businesses can't keep pace in these cramped, outdated quarters.'' 
 During an April meeting of the merchants, the governor made the personal pitch to them in a conference call. Under terms of the proposal, the 810,000-square-foot warehouse would be owned by the state, which would borrow funds to finance its construction. 
 The site is about three miles from the current produce terminal in Philadelphia and next to the South Jersey Port Corporation's Broadway Terminal, where DelMonte's produce pier is located. The merchants would make debt (interest) payments on the loan for 15 years. Then, if they wanted to stay, the merchants would lease the center from the state. If the merchants decided to leave after 15 years, the space would be available to other tenants, according to the agreement. 
 Mr. Procacci said that the merchants would prefer to stay in Philadelphia, but that the city had not yet come up with an offer that would prevent them from heading to New Jersey. ''I'm pretty sure it's going to happen,'' he said.
 But the deal is far from done. Though the merchants voted to take New Jersey up on its offer if Philadelphia does not come up with a better plan, they are still in talks with Philadelphia officials. The city, which stands to lose $3.8 million in taxes in addition to the 1,100 jobs, is working to counter New Jersey's proposal.
 John Grady, senior vice president of the Philadelphia Industrial Development Corporation, which owns the produce center, said the city had been working with the merchants on development of a site in the nearby former Philadelphia Navy Yard that would have had access to a new Norfolk Southern Corporation rail yard. The city abandoned that move, deciding that the infrastructure costs would be too high. Philadelphia officials are now pulling together a proposal that would place the produce center on a 50-acre site along the river currently leased to a California firm that uses it to store automobiles shipped through the port. Mr. Grady declined to give the specifics of that plan, but he sounded hopeful.
 ''We have a long-standing relationship with most of the merchants,'' he said. ''They've been happy for years. We've been talking to them for over a year about a new facility and continue to have those conversations. We'll have to let them make the decision about where they want to be.''
 While the merchants say that they support a move out-of-state, the workers at the produce center are not quite so confident that it is a good idea. Paul Cardullo, president of Teamsters Local 929, which represents 80 percent of the terminal's workers, said the majority of the workers lived in Pennsylvania and would like to keep the produce center in that state. He said that he was concerned that a move to New Jersey would hurt business, because it would add bridge tolls, fuel costs and inconvenience to buyers. ''I'm hoping they stay,'' he said, ''because I think they will lose customers.''
 This is not the first time the produce merchants have considered such a move. In 1989, they backed down from threats to move to a 650-acre site in Burlington County. 
 If the current deal is completed, it will be a coup for New Jersey in its efforts to win over Philadelphia tenants. The state's latest defeat came in April, when the Cigna Corporation, faced with a similar deadline, rejected a $100 million package from New Jersey to resettle on the Camden riverfront, choosing instead to keep 1,500 employees in Philadelphia.
 For Philadelphia, the merchants' move would change a way of life for restaurant owners, mom-and-pop retailers and individuals. 
 ''It has been an important part of our economy for a number of years,'' Mr. Grady said. ''More important than the direct jobs, it represents a strong supporting industry for restaurants, hotels and the regional economy.''

 BODY:
Jesse wants to meet at Hooters. ''It's 40 minutes from where I live,'' he says, ''but trust me, it's worth the drive.''
 Jesse is 15. Surprisingly, there is no age requirement to dine at Hooters. When I call the restaurant to make sure I'm not aiding and abetting teen delinquency, the woman who picks up seems annoyed I would even ask. ''No, we're a family restaurant,'' she says. So, amid the bronzed, scantily clad waitresses and a boisterous bachelor party, I find Jesse, a high-school sophomore with broad shoulders and messy brown hair peeking out from underneath his baseball cap. Jesse is there with four of his close friends, whom he has arranged for me to meet.
 Among them is Caity, a thin, 14-year-old freshman with long blond hair and braces, who says that she is a virgin but that she occasionally ''hooks up'' with guys. Caity doesn't make clear what she means by ''hooking up.'' The term itself is vague -- covering everything from kissing to intercourse -- though it is sometimes a euphemism for oral sex, performed by a girl on a boy. Sitting next to Caity is her best friend, Kate, also 14, whom everyone affectionately refers to as the ''prude'' of the group. Outgoing and attractive, she's had a boyfriend for a couple of months, but they haven't even kissed yet. 
 In her New England exurban world, where, I was told, oral sex is common by eighth or ninth grade, and where hookups may skip kissing altogether, Kate's predicament strikes her friends, and even herself, as bizarre. ''It's retarded,'' she says, burying her head in Caity's shoulder. ''Even my mom thinks it's weird.''
 Just a few weeks ago, Caity and Kate met a cute boy at the mall. ''Me and Kate walked into this store,'' Caity says, ''and this boy saw the shirt Kate was wearing that says, 'Kiss Me, I'm an Amoeba.' So he was, like, 'That's an awesome shirt.' And she was, like, 'Want me to make you one?' So he went and got Sharpies, and she went and got T-shirts, we met back there and then he said to me, 'You want my screen name?' So he wrote it on my arm. He just got his license, so he came up, and we hooked up.''
 I ask Caity if that's it, or if her hookup might lead to something more. ''We might date,'' she tells me. ''I don't know. It's just that guys can get so annoying when you start dating them.''
 Adam, a 16-year-old sophomore at the end of the table, breaks in, adding that girls, too, can get really annoying when you start dating them. A soccer player with shaggy blond hair and a muscular body, he likes to lift his shirt at inappropriate times (like now, to the Hooters waitress) and scream, ''I've had sex!'' Adam has had the most hookups of the group -- about 10, he estimates.
 When he lived in Florida last year, he lost his virginity to a friend who threw a condom at him and ordered him to put it on. ''Down in Key West, high-school girls are crazy,'' Adam said. ''Girls were making out with each other on the beach. Lesbians are cool!''
While Adam and Caity denied it, there was a thick fog of sexual intrigue that surrounded their friendship -- and a few weeks after our dinner at Hooters, Jesse sent me an online message notifying me of a hookup in the making between Adam and Caity. They were planning to go over to Jesse's house and ''mess around.'' As Jesse explained it, Adam told Caity he didn't want a relationship, and she replied that that was fine, she didn't want one, either. 
 According to Jesse, Caity set the ground rules. ''Caity told me, 'Adam knows he's not going to get in my pants, but I might get into his.' For now they might just make out, but Caity said that if they hang out a lot more, maybe they'll do more.'' The next day, Jesse messaged me to say that the hookup never materialized. ''Everyone got busy. But I'm guessing it still might happen.''
 I first met Jesse online at facethejury.com, one of many Internet sites popular with high-school and college students, where teenagers can post profiles, exchange e-mail and arrange to hook up. (Though facethejury.com, like many such sites, requires members to be 18, younger teenagers routinely lie about their age.) Over the course of several months spent hanging out and communicating online with nearly 100 high-school students (mostly white, middle- and upper-middle-class suburban and exurban teenagers from the Northeast and Midwest), I heard the same thing: hooking up is more common than dating. 
 Most of the teenagers I spoke to could think of only a handful of serious couples at their school. One senior in Chicago, who'd been dating the same girl since sophomore year, told me that none of his friends want girlfriends and that he's made to feel like a ''loser'' because he's in a relationship. As if searching for reassurance, he turned to me and asked, ''Do you think I'm a loser?''
 The decline in dating and romantic relationships on college campuses has been deplored often enough. By 2001, it had become so pronounced that a conservative group, the Independent Women's Forum, was compelled to take out ads in college papers on the East Coast and in the Midwest pleading with students to ''Take Back the Date.'' But their efforts don't seem to have paid off. The trend toward ''hooking up'' and ''friends with benefits'' (basically, friends you hook up with regularly) has trickled down from campuses into high schools and junior highs -- and not just in large urban centers. Cellphones and the Internet, which offer teenagers an unparalleled level of privacy, make hooking up that much easier, whether they live in New York City or Boise. 
 And yet, still, many date. Or sort of, falling out of romantic relationships into hookups and back again. When teenagers do date, they often do so in ways that would be unrecognizable to their parents, or even to their older siblings. A ''formal date'' might be a trip to the mall with a date and some friends. Teenagers regularly flirt online first, and then decide whether to do so in real life. Dating someone from your school is considered by many to be risky, akin to seeing someone from the office, so teenagers tend to look to nearby schools or towns, whether they're hoping to date or just to hook up. 
 It's not that teenagers have given up on love altogether. Most of the high-school students I spent time with said they expected to meet the right person, fall in love and marry -- eventually. It's just that high school, many insist, isn't the place to worry about that. High school is about keeping your options open. Relationships are about closing them. As these teenagers see it, marriage and monogamy will seamlessly replace their youthful hookup careers sometime in their mid- to late 20's -- or, as one high-school boy from Rhode Island told me online, when ''we turn 30 and no one hot wants us anymore.'' 
 Brian, a 16-year-old friend of Jesse's, put it this way: ''Being in a real relationship just complicates everything. You feel obligated to be all, like, couply. And that gets really boring after a while. When you're friends with benefits, you go over, hook up, then play video games or something. It rocks.''

Why Valentine's Day Is for Losers
Dating practices and sexual behavior still vary along racial and economic lines, but some common assumptions, particularly about suburban versus urban kids, no longer hold true. Parents often think that teenagers who grow up in cities are more prone to promiscuous sexual behavior than teenagers in the suburbs. But according to a comprehensive study sponsored by the National Institute of Child Health and Development, more suburban 12th graders than urban ones have had sex outside of a romantic relationship (43 percent, compared with 39 percent).
 It's unclear just how many teenagers choose hookups or friends with benefits over dating. Many, in fact, go back and forth, and if the distinction between hooking up and dating can seem slippery, that's because one sometimes does lead to the other. But just as often, hooking up is nothing more than what it's advertised to be: a no-strings sexual encounter. Recent studies show that it's not uncommon for high-school students to have sex with someone they aren't dating. A 2001 survey conducted by Bowling Green State University in Ohio found that of the 55 percent of local 11th graders who engaged in intercourse, 60 percent said they'd had sex with a partner who was no more than a friend. That number would perhaps be higher if the study asked about oral sex. While the teen intercourse rate has declined -- from 54 percent in 1991 to 47 percent in 2003 -- this may be partly because teenagers have simply replaced intercourse with oral sex. To a generation raised on MTV, AIDS, Britney Spears, Internet porn, Monica Lewinsky and ''Sex and the City,'' oral sex is definitely not sex (it's just ''oral''), and hooking up is definitely not a big deal.
 The teenagers I spoke to talk about hookups as matter-of-factly as they might discuss what's on the cafeteria lunch menu -- and they look at you in a funny way if you go on for too long about the ''emotional'' components of sex. But coupled with this apparent disconnection is remarkable frankness about sex, even among friends of the opposite gender. Many teenagers spend a lot of time hanging out in mixed-gender groups (at the mall, at one another's houses), and when they can't hang out in person, they hang out online, asking the questions they might not dare to in real life. While this means that some friendships become sexually charged and lead to ''friends with benefits'' (one senior from Illinois told me that most of her friends have hooked up with one another), a good number remain platonic. 
 On Valentine's Day, I was invited to spend the evening with 12 junior and senior friends in an upper-middle-class suburb of Chicago. They were hanging out, eating pizza and watching TV. Not one had a Valentine, and most said they wouldn't have it any other way. Several pointed out that having close friends of the opposite sex makes romantic relationships less essential. Besides, if you feel like something more, there's no need to feign interest in dinner and a movie. You can just hook up or call one of your friends with benefits.
 ''It would be so weird if a guy came up to me and said, 'Irene, I'd like to take you out on a date,''' said Irene, a tall, outgoing senior. ''I'd probably laugh at him. It would be sweet, but it would be so weird!''
 Irene and her friends are not nerds. They are attractive and well liked, and most have had at least one romantic relationship. If that experience taught them anything, it's that high school is no place for romantic relationships. They're complicated, messy and invariably painful. Hooking up, when done ''right,'' is exciting, sexually validating and efficient.
 ''I mean, sometimes you'll go out with a group of friends and meet someone cool, and maybe you'll hang out and hook up, but that's about it,'' said Irene's friend Marie (who asked me to use her middle name). ''There's a few people I know who date, but most of us are like, 'There's no one good to date, we don't need to date, so why date?' ''

Once Upon a Time, Before the Internet . . .
The last time American teenagers seemed this uninterested in monogamous, long-term relationships was the 1930's and early 1940's, when high-school popularity was largely equated with social (but not sexual) promiscuity: the ''cool kids'' had lots of dates with lots of different people, while the ''losers'' settled down with one person or didn't date at all. This more-the-merrier philosophy played itself out most significantly on the dance floor, where there was nothing more embarrassing for a young woman than to be stuck with the same boy all night.
 In her book ''From Front Porch to Back Seat: Courtship in 20th-Century America,'' Beth Bailey, a professor of American Studies at the University of New Mexico, points out that magazine advice columns at the time urged teenagers to keep their options open -- and, most important, to appear to be always in demand. Dating was seen as a competition that must never be lost. The advice column in Senior Scholastic, a current-events magazine for high-school students, told girls never to reject any boy outright, because ''he may come in handy for an off night.'' And Ladies Home Journal urged teenagers to be open to blind dates: they ''help keep you in circulation. They're good press agents. They even add to your collection.''
 Bailey found that ''going steady,'' when it was discussed at all before World War II, was often ridiculed by teenagers and the media. Dating a variety of people simultaneously was the key to a good social standing in high school. ''These dates had to be highly visible, and with many different people, or they didn't count,'' Bailey writes.
 But the war changed everything. Suddenly, women outnumbered men, and popular women's magazines and advice books scared American girls with dire warnings like ''Male shortage. . . . It's worse than ever,'' and ''Baldly stated, many girls of your generation will never marry.'' Young women apparently took up the challenge, because by 1959, 47 percent of brides were under 19, and those who weren't would often report that they had gone to college solely to find a husband.
 With marriage occurring at a younger and younger age, teenagers started dating earlier, too. It wasn't uncommon for 13-year-olds to go steady. Bailey cites one 1961 study of a middle-class district in Pennsylvania, in which 40 percent of fifth graders were already dating (for many, this meant holding hands and kissing). One frustrated high-school boy wrote a letter to Senior Scholastic complaining that everyone he knew went steady, and that he was labeled a ''playboy'' for wanting to date different girls.
 By the late 60's and early 70's, the rituals of high-school dating had taken on an almost prehistoric cast. The ''rules'' -- boy calls girl, boy asks girl out, boy drives to girl's house, boy talks to girl's dad, boy takes girl to movies, boy has her home by 11 (or else) -- were viewed as restrictive and old-fashioned, not to mention sexist. And that's pretty much how things stood until the Reagan era, when dating made a serious comeback. Many teenagers settled down into a mix of serial dating and going steady -- being ''popular'' often meant having a highly coveted boyfriend or girlfriend. And while parents may have felt, as they typically do, that they didn't always understand teenage culture, most still thought they had a pretty good idea of whom their kids were talking to regularly. ''Teens still had to call the home to reach the person they were interested in,'' Bailey says. ''But then came cellphones and the Internet.''

Logging On, Tuning Out
It's no coincidence that hooking up has become popular with teenagers just as the Internet has become an integral part of their social lives. Until about five years ago, Internet meeting sites were mostly the domain of gay and lesbian high-school students looking for love, sex or someone to talk to. Today many heterosexual teenagers place personal profiles on meeting sites, usually without their parents' knowledge, and spend hours in chat rooms. (Two of the more popular sites -- hotornot.com, with 4.3 million members, and facethejury.com, with 1.2 million -- were both launched in late 2000.) And while gay high-school boys frequently advertise that they ''don't do hookups'' and are only looking for relationships, fewer straight teenagers make that claim -- and many make it clear that they're looking for anything but commitment.
 ''Straight teens have abandoned the rituals of dating, while gay teens have taken them on,'' says Peter Ian Cummings, the editor of XY, a national magazine for young gay men. The Internet, Cummings says, has made it possible for heterosexual teenagers to act the way ''most of straight society assumes gay men act.''
 The day I spent with Haris and Emcho, two varsity soccer players at a high school in the Chicago area, would seem to bear that out. I'd met Emcho (he asked me to use his nickname) on facethejury.com, where he typically receives high ratings. (Visitors to the site rate personal photos on a scale from 1 to 10, with anything under a 5 meaning, as one teenager told me, ''that you should crawl into a hole and die.'')
 Tall and lanky, with brown hair and a crush-inducing smile, Emcho said there are benefits to being highly rated on a site like facethejury. There was the college girl online who invited Emcho and a friend over to a party at her apartment. ''I was online writing my senior paper,'' Emcho said, ''and this girl instant-messages me and says, 'Hey, I saw your picture on facethejury.''' She invited Emcho over that night. They had sex in her bathroom, Emcho told me, and met up a few more times, but he says he cut it off when she started talking about wanting to date him.
 Emcho and Haris said they're both partial to ''preppy suburban girls.'' As Haris put it, ''City girls are cool, but suburban girls are crazy cool!'' (Meaning, Haris explains, that suburban girls are ''easier.'') Recently, he and Emcho met up with two high-school girls. One girl offered to sneak them all into her house, where she and Emcho hooked up on the floor, while Haris and her friend used the closet.
 With so many teenagers online willing to hook up, Emcho and Haris say there's no need to rush a relationship. ''A lot of guys get in relationships just so they can get steady [expletive],'' Haris told me. ''But now that it's easy to get sex outside of relationships, guys don't need relationships.''
 Last year, there was one girl Emcho really liked who really liked him, but he decided to wait a year or two before beginning a relationship with her. ''He's waiting until the well runs dry,'' Haris said with a smile. It didn't seem to occur to Emcho that the girl might not be available once he's ready.
 James Hong, co-founder of the meeting and rating site hotornot.com, which is wildly popular among teenagers, knows that much of his demographic thinks like Emcho and Haris. He says his site purposefully doesn't advertise itself as a dating service (most of its members are under 24). ''You'll never see the word 'dating' on our site, because that's much too serious for our demographic,'' he says. ''There are obviously relationships that come from the site, but mostly I think it's a lot of hanging out and hooking up. This demographic doesn't want to appear like they're needy and looking for a relationship.''
 But the neediness comes through in other ways. Many teenagers are obsessed with how complete strangers view them, and they check their online ratings several times an hour. You have to show enough of your body to entice -- washboard abs and cleavage are sure bets -- but not enough to have your photo rejected by the site moderators. If your ratings climb high enough, the sites will often feature your profile in their ''top girls'' or ''hottest guys'' sections, making some high-school students feel like superstars.
 Once there, you're likely to receive hundreds of adoring e-mail messages from teenagers around the country, and many local offers to hang out and hook up. For teenagers who already consider themselves attractive, the sites can be an ego boost. And for teenagers who aren't sure, the sites offer a chance -- with the right picture -- to feel wanted, too.
 But if your ratings are only average, it can be tough. I spoke to several boys with low ratings who tried hard to sound unfazed, but underneath their nonchalance was an obvious hurt. One pouty, brown-haired sophomore in Boston with an average rating called facethejury.com a ''whorehouse for people who hate themselves and the way they look, and search for affirmation from the outside.'' So why is he on it? ''Boredom,'' he told me. ''It's also entertaining in a perverse kind of way. I've had four highly overweight women in their late 20's ask to meet me.''
 There's something surreal about teenagers with online personal profiles, and that's especially true when they're 13-year-olds, which is some of what you'll find on buddypic.com. Out of some 50,000 profiles, more than 4,000 are from baby-faced kids around the country. Some lift their shirts in their pictures, showing off their stomachs. Others make it clear what they aren't looking for. ''LOTS of piercings, ugly . . . chicks, snitches, teacher's pets, stinky . . . chicks'' reads one 13-year-old's ''Dislikes'' column. His ''Likes'' column is simpler: ''Sexy body, Blonde, Blue eyes . . . good personality, willing to go out of their way to be with me.''
 Buddypic.com is careful to advertise itself as ''fun, clean and real.'' But on facethejury, ''adult'' meeting sites are just a click away. The links are advertised alongside teenage profiles, which makes for some eerie echoes between the self-styled photos of teenage members -- suggestively posed and airbrushed -- and the longstanding conventions of adult erotica. For many teenage boys and some teenage girls, Internet porn, cybersex and real-time cam-to-cam connections exert a strong pull. As one Boston teenager told me, ''Who needs the hassle of dating when I've got online porn?'' Most of the boys I spoke to said they have access to Internet porn, and many said they started watching it regularly at 12, 13 or 14 years old. Some experts maintain that this kind of exposure is a lot more damaging than sneaking a peek at your dad's Playboy collection. ''The Internet gives teen boys the idea that girls are interchangeable sexual objects at their disposal,'' says Lynn Ponton, a professor of psychiatry at the University of California at San Francisco and the author of ''The Sex Lives of Teenagers.'' ''So how can they ever be developmentally ready for a real-life relationship?''

No Pain, All Gain?
Yet for all the resemblance of teenage hookup culture to a 70's singles bar, the old stigmas and prejudices haven't disappeared altogether. Most teenagers who engage in hookups still worry about being discreet. ''If you're not careful, by lunch the next day at school, everyone will know,'' says Irene, the senior from the Chicago suburb. ''Some people won't care, but others will, and if it happens too often, it will hurt your reputation.''
 And girls aren't the only ones who are worried. David, a boyish, brown-haired, 18-year-old varsity basketball player at an all-boys high school in Chicago, said the same thing. Like many male varsity athletes I spoke to, David says he isn't lacking for hookup possibilities. But he tries to be cautious. After all, too much hooking up can ruin any chances for a future relationship -- and, like many teenagers, he holds out the possibility of dating if the ''perfect'' person comes along.
 ''I've got like five girls in my phone book I can call or text-message who will give it up to me,'' he says. ''But I don't just hook up with anyone. You have to be careful. I have this huge crush on this girl who knows a lot of the girls I know, and I don't want her to find out I hook up a lot and think I'm dirty.''
 David isn't the only teenager who used the word ''dirty'' to describe hookups. Inherent in the thinking of many teenagers is the belief that hooking up, while definitely a mainstream activity, is still one that's best kept quiet. And underneath the teenage bravado I heard so often are mixed feelings about an activity that can leave them feeling depressed, confused and guilty. 
 As much as teenagers like to talk a good game, hooking up isn't nearly as seamless as they'd like it to be, and there are many ways it can go wrong. At the Valentine's Day gathering, Irene and her friends laid out the unwritten etiquette of teenage hookups: if you want it to be a hookup relationship, then you don't call the person for anything except plans to hook up. You don't invite them out with you. You don't call just to say hi. You don't confuse the matter. You just keep it purely sexual, and that way people don't have mixed expectations, and no one gets hurt.
 But, invariably, people do. Many teenagers told me they were hurt by hookups -- usually because they expected or hoped for more. But they often blamed themselves for letting their emotions get the best of them. The hookups weren't the problem. They were the problem.
 When Irene was 15, she hooked up for a while with a boy (''We basically became friends with benefits,'' she says) who never came around to asking her out officially, as Irene secretly hoped he would. In the end, she was devastated. ''Since then, I've become really good at keeping my emotions in check,'' she says. ''I can hook up with a guy and not fall for him.''
 In fact, many teenagers opt for hookups after a romantic relationship has soured. Boys are less likely to admit this, although Jesse, from New England, isn't afraid to. ''I'd usually hook up because I got my heart broken by a girl, and I didn't want to feel like I had lost everything,'' he said. ''So I'd hear that a girl was interested in me, I'd get a ride to her house, we'd hang out and mess around some and I'd leave. Afterward I'd feel dumb, like it wasn't needed. But before you do it, you feel like it's definitely needed.''
 Melissa, a senior in a high school north of Boston, confessed she'd never had a good relationship. ''Dating causes pain,'' she told me when I first communicated with her online. ''It's easier not to get attached. And I realized that if it's O.K. for guys to play the field and have sex with 28,000 people, I should be able to, also.''
 The day we met in person, Melissa was in a foul mood. Her ''friend with benefits'' had just broken up with her. ''How is that even possible?'' she said, sitting, shoulders slumped, in a booth at a diner. ''The point of having a friend with benefits is that you won't get broken up with, you won't get hurt. He told me online that he met a girl that he really likes, so now, of course, we can't hook up anymore.''
 Melissa and the boy used to meet up about once a week. ''To be honest, we don't even really like hanging out together,'' she told me. They met only to have sex. ''I go to his house, we sit there and talk for two minutes, then we go at it. Then we sit there again for about 10 minutes, and I go home.'' (Clearly, for some teenagers, ''friends with benefits'' is a misnomer. Take away the sex, and they probably wouldn't hang out at all.) Melissa forwarded me one of her online conversations with the boy:
 Boy: What are you doing other than not talking to me?
 Melissa: Nothing at all. . . . 
 Boy: Wow, you're as bored as I am?!? . . . 
 Melissa: Booooooooored.
 Boy: lol. Yup. Life is good. lol.
 Melissa: Freakin' fantastic. Lemme tell ya.
 Boy: I wish you lived like next door. . . . It would be so much easier. . . . Like I don't know about you, but I wanna [expletive].
 Melissa: U always wanna [expletive].
 Boy: True.
 Melissa: Haha.
 Boy: But that's cuz we've been talking about it and haven't done it. It's built up.
 Melissa: That's bc u haven't picked me up yet silly. . . . Well I'm gonna go
 lay down. U know my number and where I live if things work out soon.
 Boy: Hey wait. If I can do you wanna come over?
 Melissa: Sure. So just call me.
 Boy: Do you have condoms?
 Melissa: Yes dear.
 Boy: Hold on.
 Melissa: I'm holding.
 Boy: I can come get you right now if you want.
 Melissa: Um gimme a sec. . . . 
 Boy: O.K.?? I'll come get you now if you're ready. . . . 
 Melissa: But I'm gonna be boring tonite . . . and I'm just telling u I'm not in the mood for nething but str8-up sex.
 ''I have my friends for my emotional needs, so I don't need that from the guy I'm having sex with,'' Melissa explained at the time, sounding very much like the ''Sex and the City'' character Samantha Jones. So why, now that the boy had ''broken up'' with her, was she feeling so depressed? ''It's really stupid, I know,'' she said, shaking her head. ''It's kind of ironic, isn't it? I try to set up a situation where I won't get hurt, and I still manage to get hurt.''
 On the plus side, there's a new boy who's interested in her. ''Problem is, he's annoying,'' Melissa said. ''I liked him before we hooked up. Now I can't stand him. He's so needy, and he won't stop calling.'' Melissa said she was going to wait until after Valentine's Day to tell him she was not interested. ''I want a Valentine's Day present,'' she said. ''After that, I'm just not going to answer my phone.'' (As it turned out, they broke up before Valentine's Day.)
 Like other high-school girls I talked to, Melissa says she doesn't see why boys get to have ''all the fun,'' although during the few months we communicated, it was clear that Melissa's hookups rarely brought her joy. She complained often about being depressed, and her hookups, which she hoped would make her feel better, usually left her feeling worse. But a few days after a hookup, she would have forgotten that they tended to make her miserable, and would tell me excitedly about a new boy she was planning to meet. When that boy failed to show or called to say he was running an hour late, Melissa's spirits would sink -- again.
 But when I asked Melissa whether she thought hookups worked equally well for girls and boys, she surprised me with her answer. ''It's equal,'' she said. ''Everyone is using each other. That's fair.''

Girls Just Want to Have Fun?
Ashley, an outgoing junior who is friends with Jesse, met her current boyfriend at a concert in her hometown. Her parents initially balked at the age difference (she's 17, he's 21), but she was quick to reassure them. ''People assume that if the guy's older, he's the one making all the moves and using the girl,'' Ashley told me. ''But trust me, I was definitely the aggressor. I got into his pants. He didn't get into mine.''
 The question of who's in control and who is getting the short end of the stick -- whether in dating or hookups -- kept cropping up. ''Guys who are 16, 17, 18, they're just totally clueless,'' said Irene, the 17-year-old from the upper-middle-class Chicago suburb. ''They'll be like, 'I kind of want you, but now that I have you, I don't really want you anymore, so maybe I should break up with you and have you as a friend with benefits.''' Irene, like many of her high-school friends, has no problem meeting boys who are in college -- and the implication is that maybe they offer something high-school boys don't.
 So who's hooking up with guys in high school? Freshmen and sophomore girls. ''Some senior girls won't even look at us,'' said one high-school senior from Glenview, another suburb of Chicago, ''but underclassmen, they look at us like we're gods. Which, of course, we are, so it works out well.'' He told me that he regularly hooks up with a sophomore from another school, but he doesn't take her out with his friends. ''Until I find someone special, I'm playing the ballfield.''
 While many girls insist they receive sexual attention during hookups, just as many boys say hookups are mostly about pleasing the guy. Michael Milburn, professor of psychology at the University of Massachusetts, Boston, and co-author of the book ''Sexual Intelligence,'' an examination of sexual beliefs and behaviors in America, says that the boys' take is more accurate. ''Most of the time, it's the younger girl performing fellatio on the older boy, with the boy doing very little to pleasure the girl,'' Milburn says. Some girls told me that guys think it's ''nasty'' to perform oral sex on a girl. So a lot of girls will just perform oral sex on the guy ''and not expect anything in return, because she'll know that he probably thinks it's gross,'' Irene told me. But her friend Andi pointed out that many girls are themselves insecure about receiving oral sex; they'd rather just have intercourse. 
 There's a firm belief among many experts on teenage sex that girls, however much they protest to the contrary, are not getting as much pleasure out of hookups as they claim. I was invited to a high school in Boston, where I met with a group of seniors who were debating this very issue. I relayed a conversation I'd had with Marline Pearson, a sociologist who has developed a school curriculum for teenagers called Love U2: Getting Smarter About Relationships, Sex, Babies and Marriage. ''In some ways,'' Pearson said, ''I think girls had more power in the 1960's, when they said: 'O.K., you want to get to first base? This is what you have to do.' Today it's: 'O.K., you want to get to third base? Come over.' I'm a feminist, but I think we've put girls back in the dark ages, with very little power.''
 One girl, a brown-haired senior who says she sometimes hooks up with guys she meets through friends, doesn't feel that she's in the dark ages, or that she's powerless. ''If I ask a guy to come over to my house and hook up,'' she said, ''I'm the one benefiting, because I'm the one who wants to. . . . It's not just about pleasing the guy.''
 Her friend, a well-spoken senior with shaggy brown hair, faded jeans and a T-shirt with the sleeves rolled up to her shoulders, listened quietly as her friends defended a woman's right to hook up. Finally, and with some hesitation, she voiced an unpopular opinion among her friends.
 ''I feel like women have less power today,'' she said. ''It's not just that the guy often doesn't respect the girl or the girl's sexuality, but the girl sometimes doesn't really respect and validate herself. I have a friend who's 20, and he goes on the Internet and meets 16-year-old girls from the suburbs.'' He drives out there, she performs oral sex on him and he drives home. ''Who has the power there? I think that a lot of the times girls are really self-destructive.''
 ''Well,'' the first girl said, slightly annoyed, ''I don't see why a guy can have a random hookup with a girl and no one questions his motives, but when a girl does it, there's this assumption that she's a girl, so she automatically wants more out of a hookup. When I hook up, I don't want more, and it's not self-destructive. And I enjoy it.''
 Dr. Drew Pinsky, co-host of ''Loveline,'' a popular, nationally syndicated radio program that has some two million listeners and that was featured on MTV, doesn't buy it. ''It's all bravado,'' he says. ''Teens are unwittingly swept up in the social mores of the moment, and it's certainly not some alternative they're choosing to keep from getting hurt emotionally. The fact is, girls don't enjoy hookups nearly as much as boys, no matter what they say at the time. They're only doing it because that's what the boys want.''
 Wendy Shalit, whose book, ''A Return to Modesty,'' embodies what has been termed ''the new chastity,'' also says she believes that girls are being manipulated, but by a society that tries to convince them that they should act like boys, turning sexual modesty into a sign of weakness or repression -- something young women are taught to be embarrassed about. ''In the age of the hookup,'' Shalit writes, ''young women confess their romantic hopes in hushed tones, as if harboring some terrible secret.''
 Those who embrace an abstinence-only sex-education program try to influence teenage behavior by explaining that sexual pleasure requires mutual respect and security. Sarah LaBella works for CareFirst Prevention Services, a group that has taught in junior high and high schools since 1998. One gray, frigid February afternoon, I sat in on a class she was giving to teenage girls in an unremarkable suburban Illinois high school with a view of Dunkin' Donuts.
 ''Do you want to know the difference between girls and guys?'' LaBella asked. Some of the girls listened intently, others doodled or stared blankly out the window. ''Guys are like microwaves. You hit the right button, and they're ready to go. We, on the other hand, are ovens. It takes a little while for us to get heated up. You have to preheat us.''
 Most of the girls smiled, and several laughed. LaBella smiled, too, because if you can make teenagers laugh (with you, not at you), you might get them to actually listen. LaBella, who typically delivers her message to coed classes, knows that some teenagers tune her out between the S.T.D. slide show and the claim that ''the best sex'' happens only within marriage. But she says that many teenagers listen intently, as if hearing some life-altering wisdom. ''We know that most teenagers are never really taught what's involved in making a healthy relationship,'' she told me after class. ''They're trying to build relationships out of hookups or casual sex, and those relationships do not tend to be fruitful ones.''
 But are teenagers -- and teenage girls in particular -- always ill served by choosing hookups over relationships? Jeanette May, co-founder of the Coalition for Positive Sexuality, a grass-roots advocacy and educational organization based in Washington that argues that teenagers should be supported in making their own decisions about safe sex and their sexuality, is one of the few adults I spoke to who doesn't think so. ''Often, I think girls, if they are getting as much out of it as the guys, are better served by having sex for their pleasure, without a lot of emotional attachment,'' she says. ''Because they would feel more empowered to practice safe sex, use birth control and avoid sexual interactions that would not benefit them. When girls think they are in love or in a relationship that will lead to love, they're more easily manipulated.''
 Few adults would take that line. Regardless of which end of the political spectrum they find themselves on, parents and teen-sexuality experts tend to agree on one thing: hooking up is a bad thing for teenagers. They insist that it's bad emotionally and potentially bad physically. Female adolescents ages 15 to 19 have the highest incidence of both gonorrhea and chlamydia, and according to the latest C.D.C. figures, 48 percent of new S.T.D. cases reported in 2000 occurred among 15- to 24-year-olds. Many of the teenagers I talked to told me that no one they know uses condoms during oral sex, only during intercourse.
 ''Both conservatives and liberals have their respective blinders on when talking about teen sexuality,'' says Milburn, co-author of ''Sexual Intelligence.'' ''I can think of nothing more important than getting in schools and talking about sexual intelligence and healthy relationships, but most conservatives don't want an open and honest discussion about teen sexuality, and they oppose any conversation that doesn't focus on abstinence until marriage. And many liberals will resist any discussion that might touch on the negative consequences of unbridled sexuality. The conversation we need to have with teens is: 'What's the role that sexuality should play in an emotionally healthy person's life? What are the different ways that people can be sexual? What are the potential dangers?' ''

It's Saturday Night and . . .
For all the efforts to make teenagers aware of the dangers of hookups, many of the high-school students I spoke to shrugged off the idea that hooking up is ultimately a bad thing. As they see it, if they're not going to marry for another 10 years, why not focus on other things (friendships, schoolwork, sports) in high school? And if they're not hurting anyone and not getting anyone pregnant, where is the harm in a little casual fun? The truth is, teenagers may spend less of their time hooking up than adults think they do -- for many of them, friendships have become the most important part of their social lives. Kate, Caity and Adam (the group I first met at Hooters with Jesse) often spend weekend nights hanging out together and talking about sex in ways many adults would find difficult to do themselves.
 I met up with them again one Saturday evening, as they lounged around a friend's living room. No one was paying much attention to the music video playing on the big-screen TV. Instead, they spent the night talking about music, soccer, their town (and why it's better than the next town over), oral sex (why some people can't do it well), masturbation (whether girls do it, and if so, whether they do it in the shower) and anything else that sprang to mind.
 But the big news was that Kate still hadn't kissed her boyfriend. ''We talk about it all the time, but it's like whenever we get to a point when we're going to, we don't,'' Kate said. ''I feel like I'm going to have to make the first move, and I don't do first moves!''
 ''Why don't girls make first moves more often?'' asked Brian, Jesse's 16-year-old friend. ''It's really annoying.''
 ''Oh, they do if they're drunk!'' said Adam (the boy who likes to lift his shirt), sitting on the couch and strumming a guitar.
 A lot had happened since I first met Jesse. Through a friend, Adam met a girl he actually would date, except she lived too far away. The biggest development, though, was that Caity and Adam had made out at a concert in front of all their friends. ''It was really disgusting,'' Jesse said. ''They did it right in front of everybody. And it was long.'' Both Adam and Caity dismissed it as a momentary lapse. ''It just happened,'' Caity said. ''Nothing serious,'' Adam said.
 The two got to only first base (kissing), which is about the only base that anyone can agree on anymore. ''I don't understand the base system at all,'' Jesse said, lying on the floor and staring at the ceiling. ''If making out is first base, what's second base?''
 ''We need to establish an international base system,'' Brian said. ''Because right now, frankly, no one knows what's up with the bases. And that's a problem.''
 Jesse nodded in agreement. ''First base is obviously kissing,'' Brian said.
 ''Obviously,'' Jesse said.
 ''But here's the twist,'' Brian said. ''Historically, second base was breasts. But I don't think second base is breasts anymore. I think that's just a given part of first base. I mean, how can you make out without copping a feel?''
 ''True,'' Jesse said. ''And if third base is oral, what's second base?''
 ''How does this work for girls?'' asked Ashley, the 17-year-old junior. ''I mean, are the bases what's been done to you, or what you've done?''
 ''If it's what base you've gone to with a girl, you go by whoever had more done,'' Jesse told her.
 ''But we're girls,'' Ashley said. ''So we've got on bases with guys?''
 ''Right, but it doesn't matter,'' Jesse said. ''It's not what base you've had done to you, it's what bases you get to.''
 Kate shook her head. ''I'm totally lost.''
 ''See how complicated this is?'' Brian said. ''Now if someone asks you, 'So, how far did you get with her?' you have to say, 'Well, how do your bases go?' ''

HEADLINE: Prices Are Rising, and Not Only for Fuel

BYLINE: By HARLAN J. LEVY

 BODY:
THE owners of Scitico Market, an independent grocery store in Enfield, have never seen anything like it: food prices rising so fast and so high it is shocking.
 Since the beginning of May, many cuts of steak have risen $2 a pound, boneless pork was up 80 cents to $4.29, and boneless chicken breasts rose 60 cents to $4.40 a pound. A gallon of milk was up 50 cents to $3.59.
 ''It's outrageous,'' said Kevin Klein, an owner. ''It's embarrassing putting those prices out there.'' 
 Mr. Klein said he has had to raise prices because his suppliers have. He said he suspected a large part of it was because the price of gasoline had jumped, making it more expensive for suppliers to ship their products.
 Not a bad suspicion, but only partly correct. While AAA, the automobile club, reported that the average price of regular unleaded gasoline has risen almost 14 percent, to $2.06 a gallon, from April to May in Connecticut, diesel fuel, which most trucks use, has risen just 3 percent, to $1.89.
 Economists said that while rising fuel costs are partly responsible for overall price increases, there is a much broader reason. Several conditions, including economic growth in China and the trade deficit, have combined with fuel prices to create a ''perfect storm'' event that has hit consumers in more places than just their gas tanks.
 ''Core inflation has started to edge up,'' said Mickey Levy, chief economist of Bank of America. ''Production costs are pushed up by rising prices in commodities, and it has squeezed margins. Meanwhile, over the last year, the average business has experienced faster growth and product demand. So they're seeing more flexibility to raise prices at the consumer level, and it's spreading throughout the economy.''
 Economists said the factors include: a global economic recovery featuring explosive demand for a limited supply of raw materials, inflation re-emerging in the United States, huge budget and trade deficits, anticipation of a series of interest rate hikes coming sooner than expected, a cheaper dollar relative to other currencies, and a premium on raw materials reflecting an unsettled Middle East and Iraq.
 From April 2003 to April 2004, the national Producer Price Index showed that jet fuel rose 12.3 percent; No. 2 diesel fuel, used by trucks, went up 17.2 percent; softwood lumber went up 31.3 percent; plywood rose 52.3 percent;. building paper and board went up 57.7 percent, steel mill product prices increased 23.5 percent; primary non-ferrous metals were up 34.5 percent, and copper and brass were up 39.8 percent.
 The regional Consumer Price Index covering Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, and parts of Pennsylvania, tabulated by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, showed that for the first four months of this year, the index over all was up a little more than 3 percent per month on average, but not due to gasoline prices, said Rae Rosen, a senior analyst at the Federal Reserve.
 ''For instance, for the year ending in April, core inflation, which excludes food and energy, was up 3.7 percent on a 12-month basis,'' Ms. Rosen said. ''And everything is rising.'' Apparel and housing costs are just two examples, she said.
 ''It's more of a factor of the price of inputs and intermediary goods that is causing the increase in consumer prices as opposed to the cost of gasoline,'' said Michael Regan, director of research and planning at the State Department of Economic and Community Development. ''We've seen that transportation costs have not been rising as fast as the other costs.''
 Higher diesel fuel prices have inflated food transportation costs somewhat, said Gregory Grudzinski, a spokesman for Bozzuto's Inc. of Cheshire, a wholesale distributor, but that's not the reason for inflated beef costs. ''Beef prices are on the rise because of mad cow disease'' shrinking the size of healthy cattle, he said.
 Similarly, higher transportation costs are not the main culprit in increasing dairy and other food prices, said Ronald Cotterill, an agricultural economist and director of the Food Marketing Policy Center at the University of Connecticut.
 The transportation component of a typical retail food price is 5 percent, he said. So if transportation costs go up 50 percent, that would justify only a 2.5 percent increase in food prices.
 Delivery of milk cost about 20 cents a gallon in March 2003, Mr. Cotterill said, with 10 cents of that going for equipment expenses, including 5 cents for the cost of buying and operating a truck and repairs and another nickel for diesel fuel. Labor costs about 8.5 cents, Mr. Cotterill said, with another 2 cents for milk cases and other delivery materials.
 From April 2003 to mid-May 2004, the diesel fuel cost increase added 2 cents a gallon to delivery expenses, Mr. Cotterill said. At the same time, the rise in the price dairy farmers get for raw milk has gone up 65 cents to $1.65, including a 50 cent-per-gallon increase from April to May. The 65-cent increase comes from the federal Milk Market Order pricing system, which sets the price for raw fluid milk every month, based on national supply and demand figures.
 Over the last three years, farmers received ''horribly low prices,'' Mr. Cotterill said. ''Over the last three years, we've got farmers going out of business across the country, and we've lost cows in New England and the rest of the country. So now we have a true shortage of milk, and prices have skyrocketed.''
 Meanwhile, the raw material costs of metals, and plastics, which are used to package and distribute food, have also gone up significantly, said Fred V. Carstensen, an economics professor at UConn and director of the Connecticut Center for Economic Analysis. ''So every element that impacts the cost of food has been going up fairly sharply over the last three to six months.'' 
 The huge, vibrant economy of China also plays a role in inflating prices, despite China's recent effort to slow its economy, Mr. Carstensen said. ''Over the last year or so, they have become the largest consumer of steel in the world,'' he said. ''They're one of the largest consumers of coal. They've had the fastest rate of demand for petroleum products. There's almost no raw material, whether you're talking lumber, copper, plastic, or steel, that the Chinese economic miracle has not impacted.''
 Another key element prompting major price increases is the weak value of the dollar, in part weighed down by enormous trade and budget deficits. For instance, a strong yuan relative to a weak dollar means that import prices of Chinese goods will be more expensive, said Mark R. Prisloe, associate economist at the state economic development agency. ''Since we buy so much from China, that will have a much more significant impact on the prices we pay than other factors like gasoline or the other inputs, like copper, wood, or base metals,'' he said.
 When interest rates go up, as expected, business and consumer costs will follow, Mr. Carstensen said. ''Corporate borrowing is usually on variable rates, so when rates go up, it feeds through the system and increases prices.''
 In the meantime, gasoline prices have a way to go to reach their zenith, said Edward Deak, an economics professor at Fairfield University.
 ''It's very difficult to look too far in advance, but there's probably another 5 to 12 cents per gallon to go by the Fourth of July.'' Over all, he added, ''consumer prices should be increasing, hopefully at a moderate pace, but increasing for at least the next six months.''

HEADLINE: In Canada, Tourism Is Easing Its Way Back

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

DATELINE: TORONTO 

 BODY:
PERHAPS 2003 will be remembered in Canada's tourism industry in biblical terms, as a year of plagues: SARS, mad cow disease, raging forest fires in British Columbia's wilderness, a soaring Canadian dollar, a huge power failure in Ontario and cross-border political static over the United States-led invasion of Iraq, which was opposed by the Canadian government.
 This year has been far smoother, and recently the Canadian dollar eased just in time for summer, but tourism is recovering only gradually, and Canadian travel experts say it could take another year or so to rebound fully.
 All the bad news last year came amid the legalization of gay marriage in several Canadian provinces, lending the country cachet in the eyes of gay travelers. Many hoped that a boom in gay travel would save the day. But the accumulated damage last year added up to a 13.3 percent decline from 2002 in visits to Canada by foreigners. 
 Americans, by far the biggest group that comes here, made 35.5 million trips to Canada in 2003 -- from one-day excursions to Niagara Falls to longer hiking trips through the Canadian Rockies -- about a 13 percent drop from the year before. More important, the $6.3 billion (all prices in United States dollars, at $1.47 U.S. to the Canadian dollar) that Americans visitors spent was a 12.3 percent drop from 2002, according to Statistics Canada. Twenty thousand Canadian workers lost their tourism-related jobs.
 Particularly hard hit was Toronto, where more than 40 people died in the SARS epidemic -- more than in any other city outside Asia. Known for good shopping and ethnic eating, Toronto had seen its tourism industry suffer somewhat sluggish results since the late 1990's anyway, but SARS hit the city's image like a hammer. 
 This year started slowly. The 3.2 million travelers who came to Canada in January, for example, was down from 3.7 million the same month in 2003, just before the SARS epidemic hit. The cancellation of conventions last year when Canada was viewed as a health hazard -- an exaggerated and mostly unfair characterization -- still makes Canadians blanch.
 Statistics Canada, the government agency that keeps tabs on tourism and other economic statistics, has not released data for more recent months, but hotels around the country say their occupancy rates are gradually improving and reservations are up.
 Canadian tourism officials are cautiously optimistic that this will be a strong summer and that the year will end well. Bright spots include several new hotels being built and expanded in St. John's to accommodate growing tourism in Newfoundland, a new $720 million casino resort called Niagara Fallsview Casino Resort in Niagara Falls and increasing international buzz for Vancouver and Whistler related to their successful bid for the 2010 Winter Olympics.
 On the downside are the continuing financial troubles of Air Canada, which may be obliged to further diminish operations or may even go under in the months ahead.
 Still, Greg Hermus, the associate director of the Canadian Tourism Research Institute, predicted double-digit percentage increases in travel to Canada through the spring and summer, but he said that it would probably take until 2005 to come back up to the levels of 2002. 
 The tourism slowdown has spurred hotels and resorts to offer package deals, such as the Fairmont Royal York's package combining visits to Toronto with tours of several wineries in the Niagara Falls region. For $562, it includes a night's stay in the Fairmont, Continental breakfast, dinner at the hotel's restaurant and via rail transportation from Toronto to Niagara Falls and back. Toronto tourism officials are working on various summer promotional packages to include hotel rooms, museum admission tickets, restaurant meals and tickets to Blue Jays baseball games starting at $90.
 The Ontario government began a major advertising campaign in the spring, including a 16-page color brochure inserted in eight upscale American magazines like Vogue, Architectural Digest and Gourmet. It is part of a broad effort to rebrand Toronto as an exciting, multicultural city where visitors can dine well and enjoy cultural events and international-class shopping.
 ''With 60 percent of the U.S. population less than an hour away from Toronto by air, there's no excuse not to visit!'' the insert said.
 The effort to repackage Toronto has provoked some debate in a city that has long struggled to compete with the glamour of Montreal and the scenic beauty of Vancouver and to better use a pretty but underused waterfront. 
 ''Toronto's problem right now isn't the sizzle, it's the steak,'' wrote Anne Kingston in a recent newspaper column in The National Post. But with an opera house being built, in addition to a new wing of the Royal Ontario Museum by Daniel Libeskind and a renovation of the Art Gallery of Ontario by Frank Gehry coming in the next few years, more steak is on the way.

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, the Correspondent's Report column on May 30, about tourism in Canada, reversed the currency exchange rate. While the calculations were correct, the rate was $1.47 Canadian to the United States dollar, not $1.47 U.S. to the Canadian dollar.

HEADLINE: The State-Tax Tug of War

BYLINE: By DANIEL GROSS. 
Daniel Gross writes the ''Moneybox'' column for Slate.com.

 BODY:
EVERY state, and virtually every city, county and metropolitan area with any ambition, has an economic development arm. From the New York City Economic Development Council Corporation to the Wichita/Sedgwick County Partnership for Growth, public officials and private-sector cheerleaders work in tandem to attract businesses, or to persuade existing companies to expand close to home. 
 Economic development officials almost always are armed with data on state and local taxes, and with a portfolio of tax incentives. The amount of such taxes paid, they argue, can make a huge difference in a company's profitability and prospects. 
 But a study released this spring by the Economic Policy Institute, a nonprofit research group based in Washington, says that state and local taxes do not matter all that much to corporations. ''The vast majority of the studies find that there is little or no effect of state taxes on where firms invest, and little economic effect in terms of job creation,'' said the study's author, Robert G. Lynch, an associate professor of economics at Washington College in Chestertown, Md.
 State and local taxes paid directly by businesses -- corporate income taxes, sales taxes on equipment, property taxes -- account for 30 percent of all state and local taxes paid. But in 2000, Dr. Lynch concluded, these taxes were just 1.2 percent of total operating costs for companies. Because companies deduct the payments from their federal tax liability, state and local taxes eat up only 0.8 percent of total costs, or 80 cents of every $100 -- hardly enough to mean the difference between profit and loss.
 But the study may not be taking a wide-enough view of what constitutes a tax on business. In May 2003, the Tax Foundation, a policy group in Washington that advocates lower taxes, ranked the business tax climate in each state. The rankings took into account the taxes paid directly by business, as well as sales taxes, a state's fiscal balance and individual income taxes. The tax on individuals can sometimes function as a tax on business because so many businesses file income tax returns through their individual owners. ''There are more sole proprietorships than there are C-corporations,'' said Scott Moody, a senior economist at the foundation, referring to the form of corporate organization favored by large enterprises. ''And they employ 30 million people.''
 State income taxes can serve as an indirect tax on corporations. Consider two companies -- separated by a state border -- that produce roughly the same products and pay roughly the same for raw materials, interest and labor. ''When taxes rise in one of the states, companies based there have to swallow the higher costs and become less profitable,'' said Dr. Arthur B. Laffer, chairman of Laffer Associates, an economic research and consulting firm, and an economic adviser to the Reagan administration.
 Dr. Laffer and Huntington Asset Advisors of Columbus, Ohio, have created a mutual fund that uses a state's fiscal policy as one of many screening tools. ''We will look for companies that are overweighted in states that are lowering taxes, and for companies that are underweighted in ones that are raising taxes,'' he said.
 Economic development officials presume that companies will leave if taxes become too high. ''If any state imposes a greater overall tax burden than a neighboring state, business will cross the border to some extent,'' the Tax Foundation report says. As an example, Dr. Laffer, a longtime California resident, has planted the headquarters of Laffer Investments in Nashville. ''Tennessee doesn't have an income tax,'' he said.
 But taxes are just one reason people and companies move. Others include availability of a skilled work force and a desire to be near target markets. Florida's sunshine is likely almost as big a draw as its lack of a state personal income tax. In the Tax Foundation ranking last year, South Dakota had the sixth-most-favorable tax climate, while neighboring Minnesota was No.42. There has been no big shift of corporations from Minneapolis to Pierre. And by virtually every economic measure, Dr. Lynch said, Minnesota is outpacing South Dakota. 
 Finally, companies can now conduct cost and tax arbitrage not only among cities and states, but also among countries. Ohio (No.47) is not losing manufacturing jobs to a lower-tax state like Colorado (No.4); it is losing jobs to a lower-cost country like China. ''Your competition is no longer your neighbor; it's the entire global economy,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Economy.com. ''And that makes it particularly difficult to use tax policy to induce businesses to stay or expand.''

HEADLINE: Will the Fed's Slow-Mo Approach Backfire?

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
CAREFULLY orchestrated utterances from various Federal Reserve Board members make it clear that when the Fed starts raising interest rates in coming months, it will do so gingerly, as in ever so gradually. They are desperate to avoid a repeat of 1994, when aggressive rate increases of three percentage points over one year helped precipitate financial traumas of the sort that occurred in Mexico and in Orange County, Calif.
 But James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis, said he thought that the Fed's timid approach could backfire, creating just the sort of spike in rates that the central bank hopes to avoid. Given how indebted American consumers are, a sudden, sharp rise in rates could have broad and damaging implications across the economy. After all, one in three home mortgages has an adjustable rate today, exposing borrowers to considerably higher costs as rates rise. 
 ''If I am a bondholder, I want a massively aggressive, inflation-fighting Fed,'' Mr. Paulsen said. ''The last thing I want is a Fed that is timid, touchy-feely, slow and communicative. The Fed has said we're going to be slow in our response so we don't scare anybody. But I think that approach is exactly what is going to scare everybody.''
 When bondholders are afraid, they don't wait for sweet talk from Alan Greenspan. They sell bonds, pushing up interest rates, whatever the Fed says or does. 
 That has already started. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note is up one percentage point from the end of March. It hit its 2004 peak of 4.85 percent in mid-May, though it has since retreated a bit, to 4.66 percent. 
 The federal funds rate, meanwhile, stands at 1 percent. Economists are betting that the Fed will raise the rate to 1.25 percent at the meeting at the end of June, then go up an additional quarter-point in September. 
 One reason the Fed's go-slow approach is wrongheaded, Mr. Paulsen said, is that in 1994, when policy makers raised rates, they were starting from a much higher base. Short-term yields were around 3 percent and long-term yields were roughly double that level when the Fed started the rate increases. Now, with rates in the basement, the Fed could raise them two percentage points before any effect would be felt in the economy, Mr. Paulsen argued. 
 How high will bondholders take yields with the Fed in slow motion? Mr. Paulsen reckons that the 10-year Treasury could rise to 6 percent this year and maybe hit 7 percent later on a wild spike. 
 Compounding the problem, according to Paul Kasriel, director of economic research at Northern Trust in Chicago, is the Federal Reserve's willingness to keep the money-supply spigots wide open. Although the money supply contracted in the final quarter last year, he said, in the past 13 weeks, the broad measure of money supply known as M2 is up 12 percent, annualized. 
 ''It seems as though Mr. Greenspan thinks there is nothing that printing money won't solve,'' Mr. Kasriel said. ''If printing money created real wealth, then Zimbabwe would be one of the richest countries on the face of the earth. My thesis is we have really not paid the price for the excesses of the late 1990's.''
 One of the excesses that looms large right now is the debt load shouldered by the American consumer. As Mr. Paulsen pointed out, consumers have continued to increase their leverage in the past 20 years even as others -- including the industrial sector, third-world economies, the telecommunication industry, Asian countries -- have reduced their debt at various times. 
 ''If you raise mortgage rates two and a half points from their lows, we're going to find out the consumer is overindebted,'' Mr. Paulsen said. ''And suddenly, the whole issue of consumer weakness comes back.''
 The real stress test for the economy, in Mr. Kasriel's view, will come when the Fed limits credit growth. He thinks that's where we are now. 
 Mr. Kasriel expects economic growth to slow in the second half of 2004; a year from now, however, he says things will become very difficult. ''That's when I think we could see the dollar go into a sharp decline, inflation spike up and the Fed maybe has no choice but to become more aggressive,'' he said. 
 ''When rates start to rise, it changes the game,'' Mr. Kasriel said. ''That's when we ultimately pay the price for our excesses.''

HEADLINE: They Get Some Help Navigating America

BYLINE: By DIANA MARSZALEK

 BODY:
WHEN Maria Villa and her husband moved to Tarrytown from Ecuador four years ago in hopes of work and a better future, they faced a big adjustment. They spoke no English and knew almost no one. 
 After Mrs. Villa had her children, now 3 and 1, things only got worse. She felt increasingly isolated alone at home with the babies. Then the younger one came down with a serious infection, and Mrs. Villa felt panic at her inability to communicate with the doctor. 
 Today, she credits a program called the Tarrytowns Even Start Family Literacy Partnership with turning her life around. The Villa family is one of 38 in the program, which seeks to help new immigrants by helping parents and children learn English and communication skills concurrently. Mrs. Villa says she has even learned how to navigate chores like communicating with school officials, using the library and going to the post office.
 As she put it: ''The help they give us here is very important. Then we can help ourselves.''
 Even Start mothers attend classes every morning, while their prekindergarten children attend a separate school, said Susan Gitlitz, the Tarrytowns program director. After classes, parents and children spend time together reading and using computers at the Warner Library, where the adult classes are held. For working parents, there is a night program. 
 ''Even Start is so much more than just learning English,'' Ms. Gitlitz said. ''We are working with the whole family and we're supporting the mom who is working hard to improve the education of her family.''
 The Tarrytowns program, which also covers Sleepy Hollow residents, is one of about 1,200 federally financed Even Start programs nationwide, and one of only two in Westchester County, Ms. Gitlitz said. It is operated by the Tarrytowns school district and the Elizabeth Mascia Child Care Center.
 The other local Even Start program, in Yonkers, operates somewhat differently, focusing more on job development skills. Parents receive three computer-training classes and two English classes each week. But both programs organize family field trips to places like museums and zoos, and program workers pay home visits.
 Even Start couples, who must have at least one child no older than 7 describe the program as particularly empowering, because it helps them meet entirely new cultural expectations -- significantly, the expectation that parents get involved in their children's schools. 
 Federal figures show that Even Start parents lag far behind Head Start parents, for example, in educational and income levels, Ms. Gitlitz said -- so that broaching such expectations is not only difficult but frightening. 
 It's not unusual, she said, for parents to fear entering official buildings like libraries or post offices, to say nothing of meeting with their children's teachers.
 From the start, Ms. Gitlitz said, parents are expected to be accountable -- to arrive at class on time, for example, or be shut out. They are also expected to take turns helping out in their children's preschool. 
 Recently, mothers in the program were even given a formal exam, so they could better understand what their children experienced in school testing. As many of the mothers had never received formal education, undergoing such a test was no small matter. Over all, the parents' social and academic progress has been tremendous, Ms. Gitlitz said, telling the story of a group of Even Start mothers -- only recently wary of entering a library -- attending the library's 75th anniversary celebration on their own. 
 The mothers also recently attended a play as well as a support group for women who had left older children in their native countries. They attended an awards luncheon, too; it was the first time some of them had been out without their families.
 They now routinely visit their children's schools, meet with teachers with the help of Even Start staff, learn to read train schedules, use libraries and computers and attend workshops on health, nutrition and work.
 Their children have also progressed. Typical scores of entering children put them in the 3rd to 7th percentile on early language skills, in Spanish or English, Ms. Gitlitz said. A year later, the average Even Start student ranks in the 73rd to 75th percentile.
 In the current economic climate, however, the future of the program is now at risk. The president's 2005 budget calls for eliminating Even Start's $247 million national budget. According to the federal Department of Education, three national evaluations of the program found the gains of Even Start children and adults not significantly greater than those of the general immigrant population. Even Start money may therefore be redirected to other literacy programs, including Reading First and Early Reading First.
 This would be a disappointment to many in this area, among them Dr. Howard Smith, superintendent of the Public Schools of the Tarrytowns, who says he sees the program as essential here. 
 ''We have a very regular influx of immigrants,'' Dr. Smith said. ''This is not something we're dealing with as a temporary wave. We have to have something built into our infrastructure that is designed to be truly welcoming and provide an outreach so we don't wait for people to find their way to us.''
 He added, ''We need to have a framework for reaching out and connecting to people to help them understand what it takes to live in this country.''
 Not only are Even Start children already entering school better prepared, Dr. Smith said, but the program's emphasis on parent involvement is essential to ensuring students' future successes.
 ''The research is inescapable,'' Dr. Smith said. ''When you see successful kids you see involved parents.'' 
 Gladys Maldonado, a Sleepy Hollow resident from Ecuador, said her life changed when she started attending Even Start with her 3-year-old daughter eight months ago. Although she is university-educated and had a career in Ecuador, Mrs. Maldonado says her days here were spent primarily alone doing housework.
 Even Start renewed her sense of independence and responsibility, she said.
 ''This program is low stress. With this program I can go places.
 ''I enjoy it.''

HEADLINE: Doing Good While Doing Well

BYLINE: By KATE STONE LOMBARDI

DATELINE: Rye Brook 

 BODY:
The effect of Westchester's nonprofit organizations is readily felt in the quality of life here, whether it is a hot meal delivered to a homebound elderly person or a grant that allows a dance troupe to continue to perform. But now a study has documented another dimension of the nonprofit industry -- its hefty effect on the economic life of the county.
 Nonprofit organizations -- more than 1,000 -- contributed more than $3.6 billion in revenues and provided more than 8 percent of the jobs in the county in 2000, according to a report released last week. The rest of the work force in Westchester is divided between private industry -- 78 percent -- and and government -- 14 percent. 
 The study was the first in New York State to examine the economic impact of charities on the region. Although the figures it relies on do not reflect the dramatic negative impact of Sept. 11, 2001, the document represents a new framework for assessing the value of charities to the community.
 ''Most of us in the not-for-profit sector have by and large said we are the feel-good sector,'' said Ralph Gregory, president of the United Way of Westchester-Putnam. ''We do make others feel better, we do change lives and we do offer opportunities that no one else can, but that's very difficult to measure. This is another way of measuring what we're all about and how important we are.'' 
 The report, which was sponsored by the Business Council of Westchester and conducted by the Edwin G. Michaelian Institute of Public Policy and Management at Pace University, also provides the first comprehensive profile of the nonprofit sector in the county. Westchester has 1,137 active charities, excluding private foundations. The study broke the organizations into categories: health, human resources, education, arts and cultural, religious, environmental, international and unclassified. 
 Nonprofit groups in the health field achieved by far the greatest revenues, with more than $1.7 billion in 2000. Education groups followed, with revenues of more than $810 million, followed by human services, with revenues of $623 million.
 Catherine Marsh, executive director of the Westchester Community Foundation, said the study sent an important message to the business community and gave charities a new perspective on themselves. 
 ''For so long,'' she said, ''so many nonprofits have gone around with a tin cup in their hand without really thinking about how much they do give to the county, not only in the services they provide, but in terms of what they do for the economy.'' 
 Dr. Gregory M. Holtz, research director of the Michaelian Institute, said that assigning a dollar value to the impact of the nonprofit sector allowed the groups to develop ''a common language'' with the business community. He said it was particularly important to view the charitable community as a whole to gauge its financial influence accurately. 
 ''It's an easy sector to discount because it's so diffuse,'' Dr. Holtz said. ''You can see a hospital, but you can't always see a small group agency providing help to families in Mount Vernon or Yonkers. You could have a total budget of $25,000, and it would be lost unless your Westchester County colleagues are in the same category. Individually, your impact is tiny, except on individual lives, and that's anecdotal. People don't buy anecdotes in the business community.''
 The study was presented at what was billed as a Not-for-Profit Leadership summit meeting last week in Rye Brook, organized by the United Way of Westchester-Putnam. More than 700 people representing 500 charities gathered to discuss strategies for their work. 
 Ms. Marsh said it was important for nonprofit organizations to recognize their common ground. It is rare for arts groups to compare plans and goals with human services or environmental organizations, she said, and the study and the conference allowed the agencies to acknowledge their combined influence and to address their shared interests.
 ADDRESSING the conference, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton said the report confirmed the importance of maintaining a healthy nonprofit sector.
 ''This puts on paper and in chart form what we already know,'' she said. ''Nonprofits are vital not only in human terms, but also in economic ones as well.'' 
 Leaders in the nonprofit community said they found the study helpful, but they also pointed out its limitations. The most problematic issue, they said, is that the data are three years old. Dr. Holtz said the report used the latest figures available from the Internal Revenue Service, which were from 1998, 1999 and 2000. But that period excludes the dramatic downturn in the stock market and the economic impact of the Sept. 11 attacks. Both events had a devastating effect on the nonprofit community, so much so that a conference of the Nonprofit Council of the Business Council of Westchester last year was nicknamed ''the survival summit,'' said Mr. Gregory, of United Way. 
 ''Over all,'' he said, ''the community was even more generous after Sept. 11, but many of those dollars quite rightly were earmarked for those who were affected by 9/11. But there were those in need on Sept. 10 and still in need on Sept. 12, and those dollars were tight.'' He said that although the nonprofit sector had begun to stabilize this year, there was a growing demand for services in Westchester. 
 Richard P. Swierat, chairman of the Nonprofit Council of the Business Council of Westchester and executive director of Westchester ARC, a White Plains nonprofit group that works with the developmentally disabled, contended that the method used to collect the study's data had not been comprehensive, and that part-time workers had not been included. The report said nonprofit organizations employed 35,107 people -- more than 8.9 percent of the county's work force -- paying $1.5 billion in wages in 2000. The largest employer was health groups, employing 12,487 people, followed by education groups, employing 11,532. Health organizations, however, experienced a job loss of 16 percent from 1998 to 2000, while the combined category of arts, culture and humanities groups experienced a growth of 61 percent during the same three years, employing 810 people in 2000.
 In 2000, average annual wages for nonprofit groups were $43,915, according to the report. Religious groups paid the lowest wages, with an average of $4,262 while health organizations paid the highest, with an average of $63,421. 
 Despite the importance of nonprofits' recognition as a significant economic player in the county's economy, several leaders of the nonprofit community cautioned against losing sight of their groups' original mission. 
 ''All of us are part of the economic community,'' Mr. Gregory said. ''For some people, business will always be the for-profit side, and we are the service side. We operate in a very businesslike manor and we use business principles. But what differentiates our worlds in that is that one, quite commendably, has a profit motive, and the other has a motive of improving the community and changing people's lives.''

HEADLINE: In Their 20's, Thinking About War

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Joshua Foer and his fellow 2004 Yale graduates had the luxury of supporting the war in Iraq because there was no immediate personal cost to them. I had the same unearned advantage as a woman who graduated from high school in 1971. Despite the possibility of student deferments, exercised by some in government today, the boys sitting in class next to me took Vietnam very seriously, and the increased uncertainty about their immediate futures created by adoption of the draft lottery intensified that concentration.
 While today's students will indeed be paying the financial and diplomatic costs of this war for decades to come, it is the families of National Guard members, reservists and those who turned to the ''volunteer'' army as their best hope for economic and educational advancement who have paid disproportionately and in blood. 
 As I tell my own students today, if a war isn't important enough for you to die in it, why should someone else's child?

HEADLINE: A Higher Minimum, State by State

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''Election-Year Shuffle on the Minimum Wage'' (Economic View, May 16):
 Even if Congress fails to act, there is no reason that a state like New York can't raise its own minimum wage. An increase to $7.10 an hour would put New York in line with Connecticut and just ahead of Massachusetts, and would directly benefit many working New Yorkers. 
 As the article noted, 12 states have raised their minimums.
 An increase has already passed the State Assembly. If election-year politics doesn't compel Congressional Republicans to approve a higher minimum nationally, Republicans in the State Senate certainly should do so for New York.

HEADLINE: You Name It

BYLINE: By Randy Cohen

 BODY:
I am an African-American male looking for Web programming work. When I used my ethnically identifying first name on my resume, I got few calls for job interviews. Now I use my middle name instead, and I've been getting more interviews. My resume is accurate about my education and experience. Is it wrong to change my first name to conceal my ethnicity? Malik Raymond Ingleton, Brooklyn 
This name change is a reasonable response to racial bias. It would be unethical -- and often illegal -- to change your name to commit or cover up fraud. But a potential employer has no right, ethically or legally, to refuse an interview because of an applicant's race. Thus you are not withholding information that is even remotely relevant. The disheartening thing is that such a tactic may be called for.
 One argument against the practice of hiding your identity as part of a minority is that that can augment discrimination by concealing how accomplished and ubiquitous a particular group is -- closeted gays, for example. This may in part explain your discomfort, the feeling of letting down the side. There is not, of course, a thoroughgoing parallel between sexual orientation and race: when you show up for an interview, it is apparent that you are an African-American. And in any case, it is not their victims but those whose bigotry prompts such measures who should feel shame.
 If you persist in your name change, you'll be in good company -- the actors Tony Curtis, Kirk Douglas and Winona Ryder, the singer Barry Manilow (O.K., I'm not sure he's really good company, not on a long car trip, not if he insists on singing for thousands of miles), the architect Frank Gehry and John Kerry's paternal grandfather, to name only a few, all changed their names to avoid the most onerous effects of discrimination. (Woody Allen and Mel Brooks also adopted stage names, but more to gain a patina of show-biz glamour than to conceal the ethnicity so central to their work.)
 As a medical student, I find that patients often bring up politics. In most forums, I share my opinions, but the doctor-patient relationship is unique and has implications for the patient's health. Should I stay away from this subject or may I talk politics if a patient raises the topic? Ari Polish, Chicago
 Etiquette once proscribed conversation about politics or religion at most social events -- a dance, a dinner party and presumably a doctor's office (although that does stretch my idea of a social event, no matter how genial your professional manner). However, what etiquette forbade ethics allows. Unless these political conversations vex your patients and thereby undermine your care for them or unless you exploit your position of trust by unduly influencing your patients, you may speak freely. Conversation need not be a confrontation, let alone the run-up to a fistfight. It is possible to discuss politics with genuine civility.
 Contrary to your assertion, the doctor-patient relationship is not unique in this regard. Similar discretion is called for in any unequal relationship -- teacher-student, clergy-churchgoer, I.R.S. auditor-weeping taxpayer. Nor should such tactfulness be limited to political discussions. Many subjects can put people at loggerheads: sex, fur, Mel Gibson.
 Talking politics presents another sort of risk. Some people prefer to patronize a doctor (or mechanic or manicurist) whose politics echo their own -- a narrow and intolerant demand. But your deferring to it is a matter of economics, not ethics.

HEADLINE: Seekers, Drawn to Las Vegas, Find a Broken Promised Land

BYLINE: By DEAN E. MURPHY

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS, May 29 

 BODY:
South on Las Vegas Boulevard, well beyond the casino-scraped skyline, there is a three-story hotel where tourists seldom go. 
 The parking lot is sprinkled with U-Haul trucks and trailers. A school bus stops at the front office. A sign on the lawn offers discounts for guests who stay a week or more.
 Inside the no-frills rooms, where sheets and blankets cost extra, a desert city's promise of new beginnings is regularly put to the test. This busy hotel and others in the Budget Suites of America chain are the cinder-block equivalent of circled wagon trains, a community of dreamers, pioneers and strivers pulling up for a while en route to someplace and something better. 
 ''When we got here, I slept wrapped up in my dad's shirts,'' said Jamie Rose Galloway, a toughened California transplant whose family recently passed her 17th birthday in a two-room unit at the back. ''We've been through worse. We were homeless once and lived in my dad's truck.''
 Many newcomers to Las Vegas use the Budget Suites to find their footing in the slippery city, the eye of a population storm that has transformed the American desert from forlorn frontier to chosen land over the last three decades.
 The metamorphosis has not only altered the barren landscape -- Las Vegas and its suburbs in Clark County unfold across 235 square miles of desert, compared with 38 square miles in 1970 -- it has exacted a social price that many newcomers find unbearable.
 Based on federal tax returns, the Internal Revenue Service estimates that nearly 55,000 people gave up on their dream of living in southern Nevada last year and moved elsewhere. A study in 2003 by the Fordham Institute for Innovation in Social Policy identified Nevada and its neighbors Arizona and New Mexico as ''social recession'' states because of chronic problems like crime, child poverty, suicide among the elderly, and high school dropouts.
 ''It is just growing too fast for its own good,'' said Sarah S., a 25-year-old bartender from Missouri, who put up at the Budget Suites on her way to Dallas with her husband and 6-year-old daughter after two years in Las Vegas. ''I don't give out our full name to anyone. I learned that living here.''
 The hotel on Las Vegas Boulevard South, like seven other Budget Suites in the city and its suburbs, is owned by Robert T. Bigelow, a wealthy businessman and U.F.O. enthusiast who a few years ago pledged to spend $500 million developing tourism in space. On earth, Mr. Bigelow's properties are the buzz of the Internet among people mulling a move to Nevada, the nation's fastest-growing state for 17 consecutive years, and even with the flaws, its newest perpetual dream machine. 
 ''We were pretty lucky and our only problem was kids racing shopping carts down the hill in the parking lot,'' one new resident, Walt Flesher, wrote in recommending the Budget Suites on the Web site www.movetolasvegas.com. ''Smashed into the side of my wife's car a week before we moved out.''
 Mr. Flesher, 61, and his wife, Shelley, 57, spent three months in a two-bedroom unit on Boulder Highway, piling their furniture from their town house in Anaheim, Calif., into the extra room. They moved out last spring to the southern fringe of the desert after buying a $193,000 house with a brown gravel yard and a twinkling view of the Strip.
 A year later, the desert has retreated and the view is now of a column of newer houses with gravel yards. Mr. Flesher's primary preoccupation, his search for a permanent job, just ended. A computer system administrator by profession, he began working in the front office of a repair shop for Rolls-Royces and other luxury cars. The Fleshers celebrated with a $5.99-per-person steak and lobster dinner at a nearby casino.
 ''Thank God for the housing inflation in California, because we came out here with a good chunk of change,'' Mr. Flesher said. ''I sent out lots of resumes and made lots of phone calls, but it was hard to even get an interview.''

Waiting for the 'Brink's Truck'
 The Budget Suites require no long-term commitments or credit cards. While that means little to guests with financial resources, it opens the doors to legions of credit-unworthy Americans. They arrive with a basic yearning for a good job and a house, regardless of the bumps on the road that brought them here.
 ''People really did once just pass through here, and now more and more they stay,'' said Hal K. Rothman, a professor of history at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, who has written extensively about the city. ''Most everyone who comes here plans to move on. It is an opportunity stop. But what happens when this town loves you, it backs the Brink's truck up to you, and lets you take what you want.''
 Jamie Rose's mother, Lori Galloway, is still waiting for that truck. She is the family's self-appointed cheerleader, seeing a garden with roses and daffodils in their future even as she recounts one hard-luck story after another. 
 At one low point in their lives in California, she would slip bologna and cheese under her blouse when buying bread at the grocery store. ''What would you have done if your children were hungry?'' she asked directly. ''I could only afford the bread.''
 Things here are already better. She can keep meals on the table by making the rounds at church-run food pantries and frequenting bargain buffets at the casinos. She collected her family's simple white dishware by playing a game the children call Dumpster diving. She found the vacuum cleaner that way, too.
 The two blankets on their bed belong to a young mother in an upstairs unit. She lent them when her daughter, who plays with Breanne, Jamie Rose's 10-year-old sister, told her that Breanne was cold at night. The Galloway sisters share the family's only bed at the Budget Suites.
 ''I think this is going to be better for my kids,'' said Mrs. Galloway, whose 21-year-old son in California is expected to join them here this summer. ''Jamie Rose likes to cook, and there is a great culinary school here.''
 Mrs. Galloway, 44, can take to complaining about gaining weight because of her heart medicine and about a government that does not seem much interested in helping families like hers, though she does collect a disability check every other week. But she catches herself.
 ''I sure would like a little more house,'' she said from the hotel sofa that doubles as her bed, before suggesting more cheerfully, ''We are more of a family here.''
 Denny Cowie, who took a room in the building behind the Galloways after a divorce, holds a dark view of the hundreds of dreamy-eyed migrants he has encountered. He calls them ''migrates'' and says he also has no experience with any metaphorical Brink's truck doling out easy riches.
 Many dreams here go bad, Mr. Cowie explained between sips of beer outside his second-floor room, and his neighbors inevitably come begging -- for alcohol, cigarettes, food and money. The downward spiral can get ugly, he said.
 ''There is nothing like coming home from work and seeing a squad car in the parking lot picking someone up,'' said Mr. Cowie, himself a migrant from Iowa. ''Or watching doors get replaced with big holes kicked in them or TV's with bullet holes. That stuff happens here all the time.''
 Like many of the Budget Suites' more grizzled residents, Mr. Cowie, who is 63, hides a softer side. Just inside his room is a desk arranged with yellowing photographs of his six sons from two marriages and the 1951 Ford pickup he used to race. In the kitchenette at the far end, Mr. Cowie keeps a cupboard stocked with bags of macaroni and cans of tomato sauce. 
 He buys the stash at a nearby 99 Cents Only Store, to give to his hotel neighbors when they run out of food.

Seduction and Delusion
 ''People can get devoured in this city,'' said Mr. Cowie, who works at a print shop that produces sex-business handouts available on many street corners. ''The people staying here could be waiting for a house or an apartment, or maybe they have run away from something. There's no way of knowing.''
 This is Las Vegas, after all, a place of seduction and delusion that treats its residents much like its visitors, anointing some as instant kings and queens while stubbornly refusing to make good on its promise to countless others. The Nevada state demographer, Jeff Hardcastle, said some surveys estimate that for every two new arrivals in Las Vegas and surrounding Clark County, one person leaves. The latest I.R.S. data puts the ratio closer to 1.5 to 1. 
 ''You have people bouncing in and bouncing out,'' Mr. Hardcastle said. 
 No matter. More keep coming than leave from all corners of the United States, most in the single-minded pursuit of homeownership. 
 ''There is money to be made in this town,'' said Rita Pina, 46, of Oakland, Calif., who has set up house in a Budget Suites near the North Las Vegas airport with her husband, Israel. ''The plan is to get jobs, and within two years, buy ourselves a house.''
 The legions of hopeful settlers are so ample that officials here have trouble keeping up with the count. Mr. Hardcastle's official forecast shows the state's population growing by 1.3 million over the next 20 years, to 3.6 million. But no one really knows.
 Driver's licenses are one measure. In April, nearly 6,200 people traded in their licenses to the Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles, nearly all of them here in Clark County. They came from 49 states, Puerto Rico, Guam and Canada. In March, the number exceeded 8,000. In 2003, about 250 people a day on average made the switch.

A House Built Every 20 Minutes
 The new residents are only the latest to join a human procession decades long that is much bigger than Las Vegas. More than seven million people have moved to four states in the arid Southwest since 1970, churning sand dunes into urban concrete from Tucson to St. George, Utah.
 Las Vegas and its suburbs have been a favored destination because of an abundance of work related to the gambling industry and an expanding stockpile of cheap housing. The state's casinos won $930 million from gamblers in March, breaking a record set in January 2001, with half the money coming from business on the Strip.
 Meanwhile, a new house gets built here on average every 20 minutes, and even that is not enough to keep up with the convoy of moving vans rolling into town.
 ''I am having a very hard time dealing with sellers right now because they are cocky, obnoxious and rude with so many buyers out there,'' said Rhonda Brinkerhoff, a real estate agent with Century 21 Express. ''I made in the first three months of this year what I made in nine months last year. I've sold eight houses in the last two weeks. I have two buyers from New York, one from California, one from Ohio, one from Tennessee. They come from everywhere.''
 In the early years of the desert boom, most of the arrivals were fleeing the rust and snow and depressed fortunes of the Northeast for a place largely unknown beyond its scorched landscape. 
 Now they are more typically like the Galloways -- failed, flawed or fed-up Californians trading one Western dream state for another. Some follow Californian businesses, which are being aggressively courted across the border by the Nevada authorities with tax breaks and other incentives.
 ''We have companies moving here from California with all of their employees,'' said A. Somer Hollingsworth, president of the Nevada Development Authority, a membership group that promotes Clark County. ''The rule of thumb is that one-third of the people coming here are retirees, one-third come with a job lined up and one-third are looking for a job.''
 But a generation of migration has shattered many illusions about the costs of the desert pact. People still find houses and jobs here, but they also find air choked with construction dust, overstretched water supplies, poor health care, impossible traffic, soaring rates of teenage suicide and drug abuse and, seeping outward from the Strip, a 24-hour culture of gambling and sex that many newcomers with children ultimately find intolerable. In one indication of how fed up some people have become, mothers with children in tow were among the several hundred people who attended a meeting in March of the Nevada Gaming Commission to protest suggestive casino and hotel billboards. 
 The study by the Fordham Institute for Innovation in Social Policy reserved the ''social recession'' designation given to Nevada for the eight states that ranked the worst -- from 43rd to 50th -- in a composite of 16 social indicators, including such things as infant mortality and average wages, based on data from 2000. Most of the bottom-rung states were in the Deep South.
 The survey found that Nevada was 50th in the nation in suicide among the elderly and food stamp coverage, 49th in high school completion and 47th in teenage drug abuse. It ranked 46th in homicides, 44th in teenage suicide and 43rd in child abuse. Its only ranking in the top 10 was 4th for ''housing cost burden,'' a measure of the average construction cost of a house in relation to per capita income.

'There's No Dream Here'
 For many newcomers, even the top 10 ranking is no consolation because they cannot afford to buy a house.
 An economic analysis prepared for the Nevada governor in 2002 showed that newcomers tend to be significantly worse off financially than other Nevadans. The report said that the adjusted gross income of the new arrivals was on average 30 percent lower than that of other residents. 
 The Center for Business and Economic Research at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, estimates that over a quarter of the newcomers to Clark County have a household income of less than $25,000 a year. Only one in four has a college degree. Meanwhile, the cost of housing has soared, jumping 20 percent on new houses and nearly 30 percent on existing ones in the first three months of this year compared with the same period in 2003. 
 ''I have no idea why people keep coming,'' said Ann Sheets, 31, a single mother of three girls who is moving back to Michigan, where she grew up. ''I tried for two years, even working two jobs at a time. There's no dream here. I see people at work in the same clothes they had on the day before.'' 
 Ms. Sheets has taken a third-floor room in the Budget Suites through July, when school lets out and she can leave for good. She intentionally chose a hotel away from the Strip, which she considers so offensive that she cupped her hands over the ears of her 7-year-old as she spoke about it. 
 ''You can't even drive down the street without seeing pictures of half-naked women,'' said Ms. Sheets, who has worked a variety of jobs, including ones at McDonald's and on the slot deck at a casino. ''Any reasonable parent that wants their kids to grow up and have a future doesn't want to be here.''
 It was Ms. Sheets who sent the two blankets downstairs to the Galloways with her middle daughter, Amber, 11. Though Ms. Sheets had not met the Galloways, she had heard about them and their hopes for this city that she was giving up on. An earnest woman whose Mickey Mouse pullover did little to lighten the heaviness she exuded, Ms. Sheets wished them well.
 ''I don't see the future here, but I guess everyone is different,'' she said.
 Mrs. Galloway is banking on it. She drove her two daughters and their pint-size dog, Louie, across the Mojave from Riverside, Calif., in a 1992 Mitsubishi Mirage last November. Her husband, Tom, an imposing man with thick tattooed arms and a walrus mustache who hauls drywall on a big rig, arrived later.
 There was not much to take with them. Most of their belongings, including the family photo albums and the big-screen television, were lost when they fell behind in payments on a self-storage unit. Still, the car, given to them by church friends, seemed cramped. There was a desktop computer, two big suitcases of clothing, a folder with important family papers and a small but heavy box with a dull brass finish.
 The box, displayed prominently with a pair of fuzzy dice atop the television in their Budget Suites room, holds the ashes of Mr. Galloway's parents.
 ''He fought under Patton and was there when the jeep rolled over on him,'' Mr. Galloway, 42, said proudly of his father, Nathan, who worked as a trucker in Los Angeles after leaving the Army. ''He helped found the Teamsters. I met Jimmy Hoffa.''
 Mrs. Galloway slipped into the other room and returned with her father-in-law's Army discharge orders from the heap of papers in the family folder. She also produced a pair of patches from his uniform.
 ''Luckily, this was not something we put in storage,'' she said. ''We lost all of his medals. They auctioned them off or something.''
 Mr. Galloway took a Pepsi from the refrigerator and settled into the couch. The dog quickly nuzzled in his lap.
 ''I always liked it here in Las Vegas,'' he said. ''It's fresh and new. I hated California. We just figured, let's get out of there.''
 Mrs. Galloway nodded. ''The drugs and the gangs there. They have them here, too, but the police seem to be on top of it.''
 ''We figured if we were going to start over again, this was the place,'' Mr. Galloway said. ''There is no state income tax here, and it's more likely for us to find work. If I lose my license, I can always go do maintenance at a casino.''
 ''If you aren't careful, you can gamble too much, though,'' Mrs. Galloway said.
 ''This is nothing compared to what we've been through,'' Mr. Galloway said.
 ''Yeah, this is heaven,'' Jamie Rose said, reaching for a cigarette.
 ''It's cleaner here,'' Mrs. Galloway said. ''Look around you. The houses are beautiful and the streets aren't dirty filthy.''
 ''The schools look nice too,'' Mr. Galloway said.
 ''They say the Mafia takes care of them,'' Mrs. Galloway said. ''They all have air-conditioning and computers, and the libraries are nice.'' 
 The girls have not gone to school since they moved here, but Mrs. Galloway has filled out the enrollment papers for Breanne, who shares her mother's smile and neighborliness and has taken to wearing a scarf over hair she just colored black cherry. 
 Jamie Rose, whose bared midriff reveals a pierced bellybutton, said she would rather start working to help the family get back on its feet. She keeps the card of a talent agent she was handed while watching Sandra Bullock film ''Miss Congeniality 2'' at the Klondike casino several miles down the boulevard. Getting that card is one of the few stories that makes Jamie Rose smile and seem like someone who just turned 17. Before their car broke down in a department store parking lot, where they finally just left it, the Galloways drove to the casino regularly for its 69-cent dinner special.
 ''My dream is to be an actress and have enough money to buy my dad a truck and my mom a house and a Viper,'' Jamie Rose said.
 ''You know what my dream is?'' Mrs. Galloway said. ''I'd like to be able to go the market and not have to put anything back.''
 ''My own room and my own bed,'' Jamie Rose continued.
 ''A house with a yard to work in,'' Mrs. Galloway said.
 Mr. Galloway's cellphone rang. 
 ''Tom,'' he answered.
 ''That's the signal,'' Mrs. Galloway said. ''He's done here. He has to go back to work.''
 Mr. Galloway hung up. ''They're waiting for me,'' he said.
 ''Daddy, can I go to Wal-Mart?'' Jamie Rose asked quickly. ''I want to go shopping and buy a bathing suit and bras.''
 ''You want to go to Silverton's for chicken-fried steak?'' Mrs. Galloway offered.
 ''No, I don't need to go,'' Jamie Rose said.
 ''It's your birthday,'' Mrs. Galloway said.
 ''No, no,'' Jamie Rose said. ''It's too expensive.''
 ''We saved for it,'' Mrs. Galloway said. ''Don't worry.''
 Jamie Rose watched from the parking lot as Mr. Galloway jumped the back fence to get to his truck, the rumble of the diesel engine muffling the shouts of boys playing basketball with a storage shed roof as the hoop.
 Mrs. Galloway finger-combed her matted curls, straightened her faded cotton tank top and asked a visitor for a ride to a church near the airport, which was handing out soup, canned meat and rice that day. She spoke mostly about how grateful she was to be starting a new life, but she cried all the way.

AMERICAN DREAMERS
The Lure of Las Vegas
 Las Vegas is America's strangest, most mythic magnet city -- a tourist town that doubles as a beacon for the American dream. A vast migration of newcomers pursuing better jobs, bigger homes and easier lives in the desert Southwest has made Las Vegas and its suburbs a land of unmatched opportunity and extreme dysfunction. Articles in this series will examine what a few typical dreamers have found there.

FORRESTAL, ROBERT P.

 BODY:
 FORRESTAL--Robert P. The Board of Directors, officers, and staff of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta are deeply saddened by the loss of Robert P. Forrestal, former president and chief executive officer. He died of cancer on May 26 at the age of 72. A native of New York City and graduate of St. John's University, he studied in France on a Fulbright Scholarship in 1953, beginning an interest in international affairs that he applied throughout his career. He later served as an officer in the U.S. Naval Intelligence, with tours of duty in Morocco, Italy, and Great Britain. Upon discharge, he earned a law degree from Georgetown, and soon joined the Federal Reserve System, where he spent most of his professional life. After six years at the Board of Governors in Washington, DC, in 1970 he joined the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta as general counsel. He later served as first vice president and chief operating officer before becoming president and CEO from 1983 to 1995. Mr. Forrestal was a member of the Fed's monetary policy making body, the FOMC, and led the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta during a period of rapid change in the banking industry and the economy. To deal with these challenges, he strengthened the Altanta Fed's research and supervisory functions while maintaining the Bank's operational efficiency in processing checks, cash, and other payments. He also increased understanding of international economics and finance, giving numerous speeches around the U.S. and in Latin America and Europe, often in French, Italian or Spanish. 
Throughout his career he was active in community service, and served on numerous boards, including those of various hospitals, universities, and other nonprofits. To his wife, Wilma Anderson Forrestal, his daughter, Renee Spoerer, and three grandsons, Robbie, Nicholas, and Thomas, we extend our condolences. Jack Guynn President and CEO Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta

HEADLINE: Be Afraid. Be Very Afraid.

BYLINE: By Verlyn Klinkenborg. 
Verlyn Klinkenborg writes editorials for The Times. He is the author, most recently, of ''The Rural Life.''

 BODY:
At least for the moment, ''The Day After Tomorrow'' -- 20th Century Fox's new movie about catastrophic climate change -- has reawakened public anxiety over global warming and broken through the thick crust of American denial. Unfortunately, the movie does for climatology only what ''Independence Day,'' also directed by Roland Emmerich, did for cosmology. It delivers summer blockbuster thrills and the kind of hyperbole -- a tidal wave pounding through Manhattan -- that makes the whole problem easy for skeptics to dismiss. All across the country, ''The Day After Tomorrow'' has started debates the movie itself cannot resolve -- debates, all too often, between the prejudiced and the ill informed. 
 As it happens, several significant new books on the environment are also about to appear, or will be published later this summer, and they could settle the debate right now -- if people take the trouble to read them. They range from anecdotal, first-person accounts of vanishing Peruvian glaciers and Pacific islands slipping beneath a rising ocean, like Mark Lynas's High Tide: The Truth About Our Climate Crisis (Picador, paper, $14), to profoundly sobering studies, like James Gustave Speth's Red Sky at Morning: America and the Crisis of the Global Environment (Yale University, $24). For the most part, these books don't advance new arguments, because the arguments essentially haven't changed. As Speth writes, ''Our use of fossil fuels -- coal, oil and natural gas -- together with deforestation have increased the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide, a heat-trapping 'greenhouse' gas . . . and thus begun the process of man-made climate change.'' This is not news. According to Donella Meadows, Jorgen Randers and Dennis Meadows, the authors of the updated Limits to Growth (Chelsea Green, cloth, $35; paper, $22.50), the ecological burden of humanity had already outstripped the carrying capacity of the earth two decades ago -- as the first edition of this book, originally published in 1972, warned it would. 
 What is news is the nature of the evidence. There are signs that global warming and environmental degradation are accelerating much more quickly than anyone expected even 10 years ago, and thus our ability to reduce the scale of climate change is swiftly diminishing. As Speth argues, ''Our first attempt at global environmental governance'' -- the international efforts leading up to the Kyoto Protocol -- yielded very little, thanks largely to opposition from the United States. ''Our second attempt,'' he writes, ''may be our last chance to get it right.'' 
 The question that haunts Speth's book -- all of these books, really -- is, why? Why have Americans refused to face up to the evidence of global warming? The answers are both political and economic. But Ross Gelbspan, a former Boston Globe reporter and editor, makes the case that the news media are also guilty. In Boiling Point (Basic Books, $22, to be published in August), he argues that on matters of scientific fact, journalists employ an essentially unfair idea of ''balance'' -- treating global warming as though it were still a matter of open conjecture, with equal weight on both sides. As a result, the story of global warming as reported in the American press largely reflects the political manipulation of the story, not the science. Accurate coverage, Gelbspan writes, ''would have reflected the position of mainstream scientists in 95 percent of the story -- with the skeptics getting a paragraph at the end.''
 To most scientists, global warming is a truly successful hypothesis. The evidence overwhelmingly shows, as predicted, that human behavior is altering the climate, with potentially catastrophic results. And yet it seems strangely difficult to scare or reason or argue Americans, the critical audience to reach, into recognizing the truth and acting on it. The world's population is trapped in a malign paradox. Instead of taking the lead, the United States -- the country with the highest emissions and the most excessive consumption, as well as enormous potential to produce innovative energy technologies -- knows and seems to care the least about global warming. Short-term self-interest is a powerful buffer against reality. So is the lobbying of the fossil fuel industries and the complacency of an administration that lives in thrall to them. 
 As the object of our collective fears, the environmental fate of the earth isn't nearly as rousing, or as pinpoint precise, as our old fear of the Bomb. The Bomb was hard to beat. We'd already seen what it could do at Alamogordo, Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Bikini. We'd watched Peter Watkins's ''War Game'' and read Jonathan Schell's ''Fate of the Earth.'' Only a few people had the Bomb, and none of them were you or the next-door neighbors. Your personal decision not to drop the Bomb had no effect on the problem. In time, the people who did have the Bomb came to understand that having it meant they couldn't use it. Using it would have meant a sudden break with history, a cataclysmic rending of reality as we knew it. Fear of the Bomb was also easily aroused. It was a fear of death, charring, radiation sickness and of something much larger too: the evisceration of society and global environmental destruction, all of it spiraling outward from that first incendiary flash. Once the powers-that-be found the will to step away from the nuclear precipice, the threat diminished abruptly -- though it will linger as long as the Bomb exists.
 Man-made climate change isn't as percussive as nuclear war. It lacks the immediacy of a mushroom cloud over the Nevada desert. Yet without international action -- a new Manhattan Project to develop low-impact energy technologies and a revolutionary commitment to global equity -- it too promises social and economic collapse. Climate change is a slow Bomb, and it has already been detonated. You and I and the next-door neighbors are all part of the problem. And even if we all shifted course immediately and began sharply reducing the causes of global warming, it would take many years before those actions began to register significantly. All the more reason, of course, to begin now -- to have begun 30 years ago. 
 We are well past the threshold of inevitable change and on the cusp of climate destabilization. As Paul R. Ehrlich and Anne H. Ehrlich note in One With Nineveh: Politics, Consumption, and the Human Future (Island Press/Shearwater, $27), ''Extreme weather events, such as heat waves and fierce storms, have become more common and are appearing in places where they have never been seen before.'' Concerted international action could help mitigate the worst effects, and many nations are well ahead of the United States in facing the issue. But the hardest part is assuming responsibility for the future. James Speth has served as an environmental adviser to Presidents Carter and Clinton. He writes that our absorption in the present -- our selfishness -- is in conflict with one of the ''central principles of environmental ethics -- the proposition that we have duties to future generations.''
 The prospects for controlling our impact on nature are not good. What it will take isn't just a change in habits of consumption, yours and mine, or an international protocol, or smaller cars and better mileage. It will take an enormous reduction in carbon dioxide emissions over the next few decades -- a far cry from the minor cuts proposed in the Kyoto Protocol, which President Bush has rejected anyway. What stands in the way is custom, ignorance, sloth, greed and fear. 
 In a way, the true puzzle of global warming isn't the mechanics of man-made climate change -- the feedback loops, the damage to the ozone layer, the shift in oceanic oscillations, the melting of the ice-caps, the desertification of formerly productive agricultural lands. Those can be studied and understood. The true puzzle is human nature. In every one of these accounts of climate change and environmental degradation, the authors note the inertia of the global system, whether they're talking about economic or climatic models of the future. But there's another kind of inertia built into the system too, and I know no better account of it than a passage from Isaac Asimov's ''Foundation,'' the opening novel in his classic series about a science called ''psychohistory,'' which combines psychology and statistics. ''The psychohistoric trend of a planet-full of people contains a huge inertia,'' says Hari Seldon, the ancestral hero of the foundation. ''To be changed it must be met with something possessing a similar inertia.''
 This is a way of saying we live as we have always lived. Sometimes -- like now -- nearly everyone is aware of dramatic changes in the world. Yet we continue to live in the assumption that we can ride out the changes without changing ourselves, coasting, as we have always coasted, on the historic wave of human development. What it will take to wake us up is a wave of equal size traveling in the opposite direction. That wave is already on its way.

HEADLINE: Shouldn't Greenspan Quit While He's Ahead?

BYLINE: By DANIEL AKST. 
Daniel Akst is a journalist and novelist who writes often about business. E-mail: culmoney@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
A YEAR ago, when President Bush said he would nominate Alan Greenspan for a fifth term as the Federal Reserve chairman, I said that it was a bad idea. Recklessly disregarding my advice, the president went ahead this month and nominated Mr. Greenspan anyway. It's an even worse idea now.
 Mr. Greenspan has his detractors -- when it comes to monetary policy, everybody is a critic -- but he has done a fine job of keeping inflation low for most of his tenure. His renomination, which he promptly accepted, no doubt had a calming effect on jittery financial markets, to say nothing of national morale. But the markets should be interpreting the selection of Mr. Greenspan as a sign of weakness, not strength. Here is why I think he's the wrong choice: 
 Whoever comes next needs to get his feet wet. Some of his admirers seem to think that he walks on water, but, as a growing number of critics now dare to say, Mr. Greenspan is not immortal. And being Fed chairman probably has a learning curve, just like any other line of work. Why not bring in someone new now, when the economy is strengthening -- rather than later, when it may be reeling? 
 He's no spring chicken. Mr. Greenspan will be 82 by the time his next term ends, in 2008. He appears to be healthy and sharp, but what if he should fall ill? Even if he just appears to falter, confidence in the central bank, the dollar and the economy could be undermined.
 The financial markets don't always know what's best, even for themselves. The markets suffer from a couple of chronic problems that are relevant here. First, they're myopic, and this short-term bias works in favor of sticking with the tried and true. The markets are also probably afflicted with what is known as loss-aversion bias, meaning that the pain of losing $1 far exceeds the pleasure of making $1. Renominating Mr. Greenspan gives comfort to the loss averse, even if it is ultimately a risky move.
 Mr. Greenspan may be the subject of a gigantic ''endowment effect.'' The economist Richard H. Thaler at the University of Chicago uses that term to describe our tendency to place a higher value on a thing if we already have it than if we have to go out and buy it. In other words, Mr. Greenspan is the devil we know, and he appears to have inspired some irrational exuberance of his own in his admirers.
 Quit while you're ahead. This is just common sense, and Mr. Greenspan's failure to embrace it at the age of 78 is, in itself, cause for doubt. Wouldn't it be better to conclude a distinguished career on a high note, celebrated by all for presiding over an extended period of growth and prosperity, than to risk going down in flames if the economy, even through no fault of his own, turns ugly? The Senate, which has authority to confirm the chairman for a new term, should think about this, too.
 Maybe a computer can do the job. Isn't it time to rid ourselves of the notion that monetary policy requires a single irreplaceable maestro, and instead simply have the Fed establish a known inflation target or some other clear rule for monetary policy? Good, flexible leadership would still be necessary to cope with any crisis, but the rest of the time, maybe the job could be automated. With an announced goal and consistent, predictable policies, markets might drive interest rates where the Fed wanted them to go anyway. Then we could stop worrying about how to clone Alan Greenspan.

HEADLINE: The American Information Revolution

BYLINE: By James Fallows. 
James Fallows, a national correspondent for The Atlantic Monthly, is the author of ''Breaking the News.''

 BODY:

THE CREATION
OF THE MEDIA
Political Origins of
Modern Communications.
By Paul Starr.
484 pp. Basic Books. $27.50.
 MOST complaints about the media are personal. Rupert Murdoch did this, Jayson Blair did that. But the most important -- and interesting -- questions are structural. How can newspapers support increasingly expensive international coverage, when most keep losing readers? How can a television station afford not to trumpet disasters and scandals on its local news, when competitors that do get higher ratings? Does concentration of ownership really matter? Is there any longer such a thing as a broad market for the news?
 Paul Starr's book says nothing directly about these issues -- or about any development in the press since the early 1940's. But the history he presents could hardly be more relevant to today's debates. ''The Creation of the Media'' is so thick with detail and careful in nuance that it is completely convincing as a work of scholarship. In this it resembles Starr's celebrated ''Social Transformation of American Medicine,'' published over 20 years ago. But more than that book, this one can also be read as instrumental history -- a version of the past with clear operational implications for the future.
 Although Starr doesn't put it quite this way, the heart of his argument is that Americans fundamentally misunderstand what is unusual about their communications media, and why. ''The media,'' for Starr's purposes, include not just the print press but also books, broadcasts (radio and television), the movies and other innovations, notably including telephones, that allow people to share information. Conventionally, Americans think that the most important fact about their news media is that, thanks to the First Amendment, they are ''free.'' The absence of governmental controls over parts of the media -- though not all, as witness broadcasters' wrangles with the Federal Communications Commission -- has indeed made America's communications system distinctive. But the emphasis on the First Amendment implies that the media's evolution has been automatic and unplanned. 
 What Starr argues -- and, in my view, powerfully demonstrates -- is that every branch of the communications system reflects deliberate political choices made under particular historic circumstances. To give one example, out of scores in the book: through the 1700's the British government feared that newspapers would fan political opposition and so restricted their growth, not directly but through onerous taxes. When, for budgetary reasons, it tried to apply these taxes to the American colonies, through the Stamp Act of 1765, it met outraged resistance. ''The colonists famously opposed the measure on the grounds that it was taxation without representation, but the specific nature of the tax also mattered,'' Starr says. The Stamp Act's burden would fall on the newspapers and pamphlets that had been so important in developing a revolutionary sensibility. As the new American republic took form, it devised a sweeping range of measures designed to foster the growth and circulation of newspapers, including as many local ones as possible.
 Starr describes this process as a ''constitutive choice,'' one that sets the conditions for future development of an institution. (This leaden term brings up my only real complaint: the writing here is denser and less inviting than in Starr's previous big book, presenting the risk that ''The Creation of the Media'' will be more influential than avidly read.) ''It is a particular argument of this book that the United States has followed a distinctive developmental path in communications ever since the American Revolution,'' he writes. This path has led to American media more technically advanced, in some ways more varied and with a wider audience than those in many other Western countries, but also with distinctive blind spots and excesses. Most of Starr's book examines three long and overlapping ''constitutive moments'' when political choices and technological developments shaped the media's growth. 
 The original moment, which Starr calls ''America's first information revolution,'' stretched from the Colonial era through the eve of the Civil War. Its distinctive trait was the intentional expansion,+through+cheap+postage,+cheap+schools+and+cheap+newspapers, of the population included in communications and therefore able to take part in public and political life. A surprise hero of Starr's book is the early Post Office, which differed from post offices in Europe in two crucial ways. It reached into the American hinterland at low rates, closing the information gap between city and countryside. And American postmen, unlike their counterparts in France and England, did not double as spies and security agents for the central government. Starr also shows how the public schools of the Northern states steadily broadened their enrollment, while those in the South did not. He has a long and detailed explanation of the policies that made books and newspapers radically less expensive in America than in Europe -- and of the political and cultural effect of the world's first truly mass circulation press. Collectively, Starr says, such measures indicated a concern ''with building not just a continental nation but a republican one.'' They were designed to make America's communications system broader and less centralized than Europe's, and they worked.
 Beginning in the mid-1800's, Starr says, the United States made its next set of basic choices about media, driven by the arrival of electronic communications: the telegraph, telephone and radio. The political circumstances for these decisions were very different from those of the early Republic. More confidence in business and less perceived need for governmental guidance of national growth meant that all three new technologies were developed by private companies in America, while governments controlled them in Europe. Starr underscores the economic importance of the telegraph. For instance, it allowed trains going opposite directions to share a single set of tracks, with sidings, eliminating the need for double tracks. The telegraph also introduced the modern concept of news, because papers across the country could report on the same event at the same time. The telephone was if anything more important in bringing people from every location into a common information system. 
 Starr's third and longest section describes the forces that had created recognizable modern media by the beginning of World War II, including the rise of movies, the growth of nationwide broadcast networks, the heyday of magazines and the erratic application of formal and informal controls on the media's content. The modern era, as he presents it, was in some ways a fall from grace. Until roughly the beginning of World War I, America's ''distinctive path in communications'' had led to systems that grew earlier and faster than anywhere else; that included more rural people and the nonelite; and that sustained unusually rapid technological innovation. Since then American media have enjoyed obvious successes, like world dominance in movies, but Starr examines some shortcomings, like the deterioration of commercial radio into a mere vehicle for ads. And this is before he even gets to television.
 Starr's account ends in 1941, with an implied promise of a further volume to discuss what's happened since. The decisions he describes are striking to the modern reader not so much because they turned out a certain way, but because they were made at all. They suggest a belief that societies and their governments can affect the path that technologies and markets take, rather than an acceptance of whatever the path turned out to be as inevitable. This concept seems utterly missing from current discussions of the media. Regulators and the public feel there is little they can do to steer the content or quality of the media (with the feeble exception of the F.C.C.'s punishing broadcasters for vulgarities that would barely be noticed on cable). Members of the media feel they have no choice but to give, immediately, what the market demands. 
 At a recent forum on media coverage of the Iraq war at the University of California, Berkeley, a network television producer finally tired of the torrent of criticism. If you don't like what you see, stop watching, he said. That was the way consumers could exercise ''choice.'' Paul Starr's original and compelling book shows that it's not the only sort of choice available to the public.

HEADLINE: MILITANTS ATTACK IN SAUDI OIL AREA; AT LEAST 10 DEAD

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR; Abeer Allam contributed reporting from Cairo for this article and Courtney C. Radsch from Washington.

DATELINE: CAIRO, Sunday, May 30 

 BODY:
Gunmen opened fire Saturday on three complexes used largely by Americans and other foreigners in Saudi Arabia's Eastern Province and seized a large group of hostages, bringing the terrorist attacks that have plagued the country for the past year into the heart of its oil-producing region.
 The official Saudi Press Agency quoted Crown Prince Abdullah, the country's de facto leader, as saying that 10 Saudis and expatriates had been killed. But sporadic gunfire continued into the night in Khobar, the town on the Persian Gulf where the attacks occurred, and the reports remained confused. 
 The death toll could climb higher, officials from Western embassies and local reporters said. 
 Tom Casey, a State Department spokesman in Washington, said one American had been killed and two others wounded in the attack. All three were civilians. He said it was unclear how the man died, and that the man's family in the United States and Saudi Arabia had been notified. However, he declined to give the man's identity, citing State Department policy concerning civilians. 
 The gunmen took some hostages at the Oasis Residential Resorts compound in Khobar, a luxury complex of 220 to 250 villas and apartments that is home to many senior Western company executives, including those from Shell, Honeywell and General Electric. About 15 hours after the attack began, the reports varied on the number of people who might still be held. Some said the gunmen were holding 15 people hostage, but other reports, quoting a manager at the Oasis, said they were holding as many as 50.
 Saudi security forces landed by helicopter early Sunday on the roof of the high-rise building where the hostages were being held.
 It was not clear whether the troops were trying to storm the building or setting up positions from which to attack or negotiate. Sporadic gunfire was heard in the early morning, but appeared to taper off, news agencies reported.
 The day was filled with dramatic efforts to capture the gunmen, who apparently scaled an unused, unguarded gate to gain entrance to the compound shortly after dawn. They then went door to door pulling residents out of their homes, said two Americans who live in Khobar and were contacted by telephone. 
 One American executive living in the compound, Owen W. Reed, described how his wife, Diane, sought protection in a back room of their house after hearing gunfire. When the gunshots seemed to be hammering through the front door, she ran out through the back garden. She fled down the street toward a guard post near their house, but she was hit in the leg by gunfire just as she reached it. She was pulled out of the line of fire by a security guard. Later in the evening, Mr. Reed said his wife was in stable condition after undergoing surgery in a local hospital.
 Another resident, who was being evacuated by Saudi security forces in an armored vehicle, said he saw a man he believed was a Swiss cook at the compound lying on the ground surrounded by blood and bodies being carried out of a house where a French couple had lived. 
 Saudi security officials had sent armored personnel carriers into the compound to rescue as many residents as possible, but some houses came under sniper fire from at least one gunman on the roof of an office building, and the security forces could not enter all the houses, witnesses said. 
 The latest strike at another oil company compound, following a similar attack on May 1 on the western Saudi town of Yanbu, seemed clearly intended as a new attempt to start an exodus of the thousands of workers on whom Saudi Arabia depends to keep its oil industry running.
 The attack on Saturday hit at the core of the relationship between the West and the Saudi kingdom. Most of the oil production and the American and other Western technicians who keep it flowing are based in and around the urban centers of Khobar, Dammam and Dhahran, clustered together near the shores of the Persian Gulf, just across from Bahrain. 
 At a time of skyrocketing oil prices, the area has become even more crucial as much of the excess capacity Saudi Arabia has said it will bring into production after an OPEC meeting in Beirut next Thursday in an effort to bring prices down runs through the production centers grouped in the Eastern Province. 
 There was a jump in prices after the attack against the petrochemical complex in Yanbu, on the Red Sea coast of the kingdom. Analysts have noted, however, that it would take an assault on a production facility itself to send real tremors through the market.
 One Western analyst said that militants surely saw the success they had in shutting down the Yanbu project and decided to carry out more of the same, especially since the Saudi Interior Ministry has repeatedly been able to track down and defuse the kinds of booby-trapped cars that have been used several times against residential compounds in Riyadh starting a year ago. More than 90 people have been killed in the past year in Saudi Arabia in terror attacks or shootouts with suspected militants.
 ''This is easier than a vehicle bomb that can be discovered,'' said the analyst. ''There are thousands of targets you can choose for this type of assault. It is very, very hard to defend against.''
 About 15,000 Americans and 10,000 Britons are believed to live in the Eastern Province, the largest concentration of foreigners in the country. The United States Embassy warned all Americans in April to leave the country.
 Some expatriates predicted that the latest shooting would set off an exodus of foreign families when the school year ends, particularly since many had decided to leave after the shooting in Yanbu.
 The company attacked in Yanbu was ABB Lummus Global Inc., a Houston-based subsidiary of the giant Swedish-Swiss construction firm ABB. The president of the Saudi branch of the company was among those hunkered down within the Oasis compound because his front door was within direct line of fire of a rooftop sniper, said David A. Cantrell, the president of the American Business Association in the area.
 ''With this going on, especially the people who are new will think that it is time to go,'' said one longtime resident who works for Saudi Aramco, the national oil company. ''Forty families had already decided to go next month before this happened. That is a lot.''
 By Saturday night, some families were already packing up and driving over the causeway leading to Bahrain, residents said. 
 An announcement posted on an Islamic Web site claimed that Al Qaeda was responsible for the attack on Saturday, wire service reports said. As with all such claims, however, it was impossible to verify. Still, the attack bore certain hallmarks of the group, including extensive planning and a choice of targets likely to have a sensational impact. 
 The attackers, for example, escaped suspicion initially by wearing the khaki camouflage uniforms of the Saudi National Guard, which bears responsibility for protecting residential compounds where foreigners mostly live.
 In recent weeks, the ostensible operations director for Al Qaeda in Saudi Arabia, Abdul Aziz al-Muqrin, has posted a series of announcements that amount to a battle plan for militants seeking to overthrow the ruling Saud dynasty.
 Crown Prince Abdullah, in his statement carried by the Saudi Press Agency, vowed to crush the militants. 
 ''Security forces will, God willing, deal with them and with others like them with force,'' he said. 
 ''Foreigners come here to serve the nation and we are the ones who invited them,'' the statement said, adding that the militants sought to ''harm the economy and foreigners so that they no longer come here.''
 At least five Lebanese who were among the hostages were released. Spokesmen for the United States and British Embassies said it was impossible to state clearly the situation was in Khobar because gunfights were continuing and it remained too dangerous to send anyone onto the streets to investigate.
 An employee who answered the telephone at Saad Specialist Hospital said a number of people had been treated there for gunshot wounds, and that hospital staff members had been told to stand by in case more casualties developed from the hostage situation.
 According to local witnesses, reporters at the scene and reports on Arab satellite channels, the gunmen attacked one office building and two compounds in the Khobar area. 
 Aside from the Oasis compound, the buildings attacked were the Petroleum Center, an office complex that housed numerous companies including Schlumberger, an oil services company, as well as Total, a French oil company, and the French consulate. 
 The other office building attacked stood just next to a residential compound and housed the offices of the Arab Petroleum Investments Corporation, known as Apicorp. The gunmen shot dead an unknown number of foreigners and Saudis at the center and opened fire on a school bus as they fled, killing an Egyptian schoolboy.
 One witness said the attackers tied a rope around one of the Westerners they had killed and dragged his body through the streets for about 200 yards before the rope snapped. A similar incident occurred in the attack in Yanbu, in which a victim had been dragged through the streets behind a vehicle. 
 Police officers chasing the gunmen got into a gunfight with them on a downtown street, according to the reports. During the fight an Indian business executive driving to work was caught in the cross-fire and fatally wounded.

HEADLINE: The Brickyard, My Backyard: It's Time to Repair the Rift in Our Sport

BYLINE: By ROGER PENSKE; As told to Dave Caldwell. Roger Penske has won the Indianapolis 500 13 times as a car owner.

 BODY:
The Indianapolis 500, in my mind, is still the greatest auto race in the world. I went to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway for the first time with my dad in 1951. We had lousy seats. But something in my DNA told me I wanted to be either a car driver or an owner. So I kept coming back. After you get past 30 years, you know you're hooked.
 This will be my 49th Indy 500 as either a spectator or as a car owner. Penske Racing has two drivers in today's race, Helio Castroneves and Sam Hornish Jr. I've missed only the five years after the split in 1996 between the Indy Racing League and Championship Auto Racing Teams, the two major associations in the sport. 
 Including Gil de Ferran's victory last May, our drivers have won this race 13 times. And yet I'm excited about winning for the 14th time. I like the pressure. You can't go back within the race and do it again. If you make a mistake, you have to wait 12 months.
 I like the challenge, too. The buildup is like the two weeks leading up to the Super Bowl. If it were easy, I guess I'd have 100 cars there, to give me a better chance. And we've been at Indy for so long that we worry about more things than most of the other teams do, because we've had a lot of experiences. There are so many things that can happen.
 I was a road racer until I retired in 1965 to open a Chevrolet dealership in West Philadelphia. I've owned an Indy-car team since 1968 and now have a team on the Nextel Cup Series in Nascar, Penske Racing South, with Rusty Wallace, Ryan Newman and Brendan Gaughan as drivers. But the acclaim for winning the Indy 500 is enormous.
 If you ask any driver from any racing series -- a Formula One driver, or an Indy-car driver or, yes, even a Nascar driver -- which race he or she would most like to win, I'd bet he or she would say the Indy 500. Once you win this race, it puts you in a special class. But it is like winning the World Series without the National League.
 The I.R.L. and CART are still split. My goal, over the next couple of months, is to come up with a way to repair the split that led me away from Indianapolis for five years. I'd like to see one group, not two, racing Indy cars again. It would benefit not only Tony George, the president of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
 You ride in the pace car with the winner after the race, and you know you've been in a special event. There has been a lot of evolution in this sport, but it's still the same racetrack, and the race still has the same prestige. But we don't see the big infield crowds at Indianapolis that we've seen over the years.
 The trajectory of Indy-car racing is not down. It's not flat. The quality of the race teams has improved. There's support for the series within the automotive industry. The sponsorships are strong. In the future, we will need to find one sponsor who will be able to do for Indy-car racing what Nextel can do for stock car racing.
 I think Tony George will be able to land a first-class sponsor for the I.R.L. Hopefully, that's on the horizon. If we have such a corporate sponsor for one series, with 35, 36, 37 cars available to compete regularly, I think it would lead to more competitive races and a better series over all than the two separate series we have now.
 In each of the last two years, there have been reports that there might not be enough cars to fill the traditional 33-car starting grid. That's economics. The old days of $15,000 cars and having only two sets of wheels are long gone. You can't win this race with merely any car, just as you can't win the Kentucky Derby with merely any horse.
 I do think you're going to see more teams migrating from CART over to the I.R.L. I think Buddy Rice winning the pole position this year for the car owner Bobby Rahal, who was a critic of Tony George before the split, was a positive step. It's still going to take some time. You can't have conflict without some fallout.
 As strong as stock car racing has become, you couldn't have two major series competing against each other. Besides, Nascar didn't get where it is in four or five years. It took a long time. Some of the people who left after the I.R.L.-CART split are only migrating back now, like Rahal and Michael Andretti, who is now a car owner.
 That's encouraging. But I'd like to see us take the next step. I think one series would benefit not only the sport, but also the businesses that surround the sport. I've used Indianapolis as a common thread in all my businesses. When I first went there as a car owner in 1969, I could see that the race could give us a brand identity.
 I'd like to see all of the top Indy-car drivers here. To think that more than 400,000 people will be at the race, I don't know of a sporting event that can compare. This place fosters teamwork. The fellow who takes the car in the truck is as important as the driver of the car. If the car doesn't get here, the driver doesn't race.
 I remember what happened in 1995, when we had two former Indy 500 champions, Emerson Fittipaldi and Al Unser Jr., fail to qualify for the race. We didn't go back until 2001, and Castroneves won two straight years. De Ferran won last year. So we have not lost an Indy 500 that we've actually competed in since 1992.
 Going to the Indy 500 is like going to the Kentucky Derby. But I didn't know what I had been missing until I came back. Now is the time for everyone to come back.

PERSON: Archibald Cox

HEADLINE: Archibald Cox, 92, Is Dead; Helped Prosecute Watergate

 BODY:
Archibald Cox, the special Watergate prosecutor who was fired by the Nixon White House in the ''Saturday Night Massacre'' in 1973, died yesterday at his home in Brooksville, Maine.
 He was 92 and died of natural causes, his wife, Phyllis, said. 
 Mr. Cox, a former solicitor general of the United States, was an expert on labor law and the author of several books on legal matters. He often took leaves from the faculty of Harvard Law School to serve in federal government posts. In 1980 he became chairman of Common Cause, the public affairs lobby, and held that position until 1992. 
 Mr. Cox took over the Watergate investigation on May 18, 1973, and was dismissed five months later on President Richard M. Nixon's orders.
 The highest federal position Mr. Cox held was solicitor general, representing the government before the Supreme Court. He was appointed to the position, the third highest in the Department of Justice, by President John F. Kennedy. He had previously served as a speechwriter and adviser to Mr. Kennedy in the Senate and in his campaign for the presidency. 
 Mr. Cox's dramatic but relatively brief time as the special Watergate prosecutor came about largely because of his friendship with a former law student, Elliot L. Richardson. 
 In late April 1973, Nixon announced the forced departure from his administration of four top- level appointees after they were swept up in the Watergate affair.
 The scandals had begun with the June 1972 burglary of the Democratic National Committee's offices in the Watergate office complex at the height of the president's re-election campaign.
 Among those forced to resign was Attorney General Richard G. Kleindienst. Nixon chose Mr. Richardson to succeed Mr. Kleindienst, specifying that ''if he should consider it appropriate, he has the authority to name a special supervising prosecutor for matters arising out of'' the Watergate case. 
 Nixon had hoped to avoid having such a prosecutor. But as the price for Mr. Richardson's confirmation, the Democratic-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee insisted that the new attorney general name a special prosecutor.
 As the special prosecutor, Mr. Cox wound up in a confrontation with the White House, where Nixon appointees suspected he was out to get the president.
 Over five months Mr. Cox built a Watergate prosecution staff of energetic young lawyers. White House officials complained that most were Kennedy Democrats.
 Mr. Cox quickly widened his investigation into a number of areas, including reports of suspicious financial dealings among members and former members of the Nixon administration.
 The ''Saturday Night Massacre'' resulted from Mr. Cox's efforts to force the White House to turn over the tapes of Oval Office conversations that ultimately proved that there had been a conspiracy to cover up the administration's ties to the Watergate burglary.
 When Nixon resisted surrendering the tapes, Mr. Cox took the matter to the courts, which ruled in his favor. But Nixon would not give in, and he ordered Mr. Cox to stop pursuing the tapes. Refusing to do so, Mr. Cox said that he was bound by conscience not to capitulate and that he would ask the courts to hold the president in contempt.
 Within a few hours, the ''massacre'' ensued. Nixon ordered Mr. Richardson to dismiss Mr. Cox, but the attorney general refused, saying that as a matter of principle he would not renege on his promise to the Judiciary Committee. Mr. Richardson resigned and the deputy attorney general, William D. Ruckelshaus, was told to fire Mr. Cox. Mr. Ruckelshaus refused and was himself dismissed. Finally, Mr. Cox was dismissed by Robert H. Bork, the solicitor general. 
 The public outcry was so intense that in the end Nixon was forced to turn over the Oval Office tapes, marking the beginning of the end of his presidency.
 Born May 17, 1912, in Plainfield, N.J., Archibald Cox Jr. was the son of Archibald and Francis Perkins Cox. His well-to-do father was a patent lawyer who sent him to St. Paul's School in Concord, N.H., from which Mr. Cox graduated in 1930. At Harvard he majored in economics and American history, graduating in 1934. 
 Mr. Cox then entered Harvard Law School and graduated magna cum laude in 1937. He later spent a year as law clerk to Judge Learned Hand of the United States Court of Appeals in New York.
 In 1941, after three years as an associate with a Boston law firm, Mr. Cox joined the staff of the National Defense Mediation Board in Washington. He also worked in the solicitor general's office and as an associate solicitor in the Department of Labor.
 He joined the Harvard Law faculty in 1945 and at various times served as Royall Professor of Law, the oldest endowed chair at the school; as Willston Professor of Law; and as Carl M. Loeb University Professor. He also taught at Boston University. 
 As a law professor Mr. Cox seemed to make a studied attempt to run his life with courtly, Yankee good humor. His crew-cut hair, button-down shirts and skinny bow ties were personal trademarks, as was his fondness for driving to work in a pickup truck from his farm in Wayland, Mass. He also had a summer home in Maine.
 A gaunt 6-footer who wore three-piece suits, Mr. Cox was often described as ''ramrod straight,'' not only because of his bearing but also because of his personality.
 In the classroom he had his detractors. He was invariably admired for his scholarship, but his lectures in labor, Constitutional and administrative law were at times criticized as ''soporific'' and ''dry.''
 ''There's no question that he's in complete command of his subject,'' one student wrote in a critique. ''But he's not a performer in the classroom. There's no sparkle at all.'' 
 In July 1952, President Harry S. Truman appointed Mr. Cox to head a new 18-member Wage Stabilization Board, which faced a backlog of 12,000 cases. But after only four months, Mr. Cox angrily resigned after the president overruled a board decision.
 The board had voted to lower a wage increase, to $1.50 a day from $1.90, that John L. Lewis of the United Mine Workers had negotiated for his coal miners. Mr. Cox returned to Harvard.
 Over the years, Mr. Cox gained a reputation for drafting labor legislation. He wrote an anti-injunction bill for labor in Massachusetts in 1950, and he helped arbitrate disputes in the machine-tool and textile industries in New England, as well as nationwide disputes in the railroad industry.
 After serving as solicitor general, Mr. Cox returned to Harvard in 1966, just as student unrest was beginning there and on campuses around the nation. At Harvard he played a major role in negotiating with student dissidents and antiwar demonstrators. In 1968 he was named chairman of a five-member committee to inquire into disturbances at Columbia University. 
 After his dismissal as the Watergate prosecutor in 1973, Mr. Cox returned to Harvard, where he taught constitutional law. 
 Mr. Cox, who became a professor emeritus at Harvard in 1984, was the author of several books, including ''Law and the National Labor Policy'' (1960); ''Civil Rights, the Constitution and the Courts'' (1967); ''Freedom of Expression'' (1981); and ''The Court and the Constitution'' (1987).
 Besides his wife, whom he married in 1927, Mr. Cox is survived by three children, Sarah, of Brooksville, Maine, Archibald Jr., of Markleville, Ind., and Phyllis, of Denver; and by several grandchildren and great-grandchildren. 
 Philip Heymann, a fellow law professor at Harvard who worked under Mr. Cox in the Watergate prosecution and was a close associate for more than 40 years, said in an interview yesterday that the legacy of Watergate had made Mr. Cox into a revered figure among lawyers, scholars and even, for a time, the general public. 
 ''He was idolized,'' Mr. Heymann said. ''I would be an airplane with him and the attendant would walk up and ask to seat him in the first-class section.''
 ''It was just a fact of life for him,'' Mr. Heymann said, ''and he didn't let it go to his head.''


CORRECTION-DATE: June 29, 2004

 CORRECTION:
An obituary in some copies on Sunday about Archibald Cox, the legal scholar and special Watergate prosecutor, misstated the year of his marriage. It was 1937, not 1927. (The date was correct in a reprinted version on Monday.)

An obituary in late editions on May 30 about Archibald Cox, a legal scholar and former Watergate prosecutor, included an erroneous reference to his work in Washington during World War II and misidentified the secretary of state during that time in some copies. He was never an assistant to Thomas K. Finletter, who was the assistant secretary of state, not the secretary. The secretary was Cordell Hull.
An obituary in late editions on May 30 about Archibald Cox, the legal scholar and former Watergate prosecutor, referred erroneously in some copies to his wartime work in Washington.

HEADLINE: Discipline Takes a Break at the White House

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
THE country may be deeply divided about President Bush, but even his harshest critics used to offer their grudging admiration of one of the greatest talents of this White House: its extraordinary discipline and message control.
 No more.
 For months now, the same administration whose members once prided themselves on never contradicting one another in public has been riven by conflicting pronouncements. Senior officials keep missing opportunities to keep their signals straight, prompting cases of vicious backbiting that one senior member of Mr. Bush's national security staff said with disgust the other day ''make us sound like Democrats.'' 
 Reporters who spent the first two-thirds of Mr. Bush's term looking for any crack between the tight-lipped members of the administration suddenly feel as if they have stepped into an amusement park, with different hawkers openly selling disparate policies, explanations and critiques.
 And as a few candid members of the administration are starting to admit, it is beginning to take a toll -- leaving allies to wonder how Mr. Bush might next change course in Iraq. It is one reason, foreign leaders say, that despite President Bush's recent string of speeches, they are uncertain how sovereign the new ''sovereign'' government of Iraq will be after the handover on June 30, or how long American troops might remain. 
 The administration has said they will be there ''as long as necessary and not a day longer,'' but aides were scrambling a few weeks ago to assure Congress that if the new Iraqi government asks American forces to leave, they will -- whether their mission is completed or not. 
 It has all sown such confusion that a European foreign minister, asked on a recent visit what he thought of the latest administration plan for the handover, smiled and responded, ''Last week's or this week's?'' 
 Much of this, of course, is attributable to the combination of the fog of war and a presidential campaign of fog. But speaking clearly to the world was something this White House boasted about, so the crossed wires have seemed particularly notable.
 There was Attorney General John Ashcroft last week warning America of alarming intelligence that ''indicates Al Qaeda's specific intention to hit the United States hard.'' He apparently never coordinated with Tom Ridge, secretary of homeland security. 
 Mr. Ridge reassured interviewers that there really was not much new intelligence floating around, just a general concern that Al Qaeda would try to influence the election or be tempted by a summer of big events, from the Group of 8 summit in Sea Island, Ga., to the party conventions.
 But soon after White House officials expressed their displeasure, Mr. Ashcroft and Mr. Ridge issued a joint statement reassuring the country that they actually do cooperate. ''We communicate every day,'' Mr. Ridge said earlier. 
 That sequence was only the latest example of the switched signals. A few weeks ago, officials from President Bush on down said there was only one fate for the radical cleric Moktada al-Sadr, leader of the Shiite militia that has been occupying the Iraqi city of Najaf: ''Kill or capture.'' 
 Under a deal last week, Mr. Sadr walks, the murder charges against him apparently dropped. And while the White House had said that his militia must be broken up, the deal will allow it to stay intact as long as it stays off the streets.
 That news came only days after the raid on Ahmad Chalabi's headquarters in Baghdad. Mr. Chalabi, now a critic of the Iraqi occupation, was a Bush administration favorite, an exiled freedom fighter who occupied a seat of honor when Mr. Bush addressed the United Nations last year and during his State of the Union address in January. The Pentagon paid Mr. Chalabi's party $335,000 a month for intelligence.
 Now his Pentagon sponsors can barely remember his name, and the rest of the administration is suddenly describing him as a con artist at best, and perhaps a leaker of military information to Iran. 
 And just days before Mr. Chalabi's public fall from grace, the Bush administration's most celebratedly careful dissident, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, declared that he now believes that the intelligence he received about the existence of mobile biological laboratories in Iraq was fabricated, and that American intelligence agencies were duped. ''The sourcing was inaccurate and wrong, and in some cases deliberately misleading,'' Mr. Powell said on NBC. 
 Intelligence officials sided with Mr. Powell, saying they had been led astray by a source provided by Mr. Chalabi's party whom they had brilliantly code-named Curveball.
 But Vice President Dick Cheney, who had been the most vocal in citing evidence that some semitrailers found in Iraq were most probably the long-sought mobile labs, has been silent on the issue. When his office was asked last week if he has revised his view, it said only that his comments ''were based upon what he knew at the time.'' 
 The list goes on. For the past two months the president has been on the road promoting his education, health care and other programs, with the White House turning out fact sheets about how much spending has increased in these politically popular areas. But no one told the Office of Management and Budget, and it inconveniently produced a May 19 memo to government departments telling them to be prepared for a $1.5 billion cut in education spending next year, and $900 million in veterans' benefits. 
 That might please conservatives worried about runaway spending, but President Bush has regularly appeared at ''No Child Left Behind'' celebrations boasting that he has increased federal money to the schools by nearly 60 percent.
 So all over Washington, Republicans and Democrats alike are asking what cog got loose or, put another way, how did an administration that made an art form of singing from the hymnal suddenly lose its rhythm?
 Maybe this is the natural wear and tear of an administration well into its fourth year, having survived the stresses of an economic downturn, a terror attack and two wars. Many think it is a casualty of Iraq: When the occupation turned south, the backbiting and second-guessing were inevitable. 
 ''Certainly one reason is that when things are going well it's a lot easier to stay on the same page than when everything seems to be going wrong,'' said David R. Gergen, the longtime political strategist, now at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, who was brought in by President Bill Clinton to bring discipline to a White House where everyone would say anything. 
 Mr. Gergen believes that the departure of Karen Hughes, the communications director who channeled Mr. Bush's thoughts better than anyone, was one reason.
 But the problem runs deeper and has given rise to alternative theories. Ron Suskind, who wrote ''The Price of Loyalty,'' the tell-all book about former Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill, thinks the stories of loyalty inside the administration were overblown. Mr. O'Neill felt that Mr. Bush never listened to him. On the way out of Washington after he was fired, Mr. O'Neill handed Mr. Suskind a CD-ROM with 19,000 documents, including a few the White House would have kept out of view for years. 
 ''What you find is that coerced discipline often erodes,'' Mr. Suskind said. ''And when it goes, it really goes. Some of that rigor of message was suddenly the stuff of coercion, born of fear rather than real loyalty.'' His book was followed by Richard A. Clarke's unflattering inside account of the counterterrorism operation and Bob Woodward's account of the White House's march to war.
 Another theory is that while the president is thinking about his second term, many of those in his cabinet are thinking about getting out -- Mr. Powell first among them. That changes every political calculation; many suspect that the secretary of state, among others, is thinking about his legacy, and wants to clear the ledgers before he leaves.
 Mr. Powell himself alluded to the divisions in the administration last week, if only to dismiss them as business as usual. ''The president has always welcomed different points of view from people in his administration who have strongly held different points of view,'' he said. ''Most of the time, we are in agreement. When we are not in agreement, you guys sell newspapers. And people write books. And surprise, surprise, sometimes we are in disagreement.''

HEADLINE: Need ESPN but Not MTV? Some Push for That Option

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT

 BODY:
When L. Brent Bozell watches ''Nip/Tuck,'' the FX show that explores the nation's fascination with plastic surgeons, he sees a violent program where doctors slash and reconstruct noses to the accompaniment of ''Paint It Black'' by the Rolling Stones. 
 His distaste would normally have little significance -- beyond his forbidding his own children from watching -- but Mr. Bozell is the head of the Parents Television Council, a conservative organization that is part of the growing chorus of voices protesting violence and indecency on television. Along with other groups that are monitoring cable content -- Concerned Women for America and Citizens for Community Values -- Mr. Bozell opposes the current system where cable companies sell a bundled number of services to customers but do not let them pick and chose which channels they want to pay for. 
 ''If you go to the 7-Eleven to buy a quart of milk, you are not forced to take a six pack of beer, too,'' said Mr. Bozell, who wants the right to buy only the channels he and his family watch. 
 The issue of a la carte pricing is a headache that the cable companies and networks have long tried to avoid. But now, cable pricing is coming under new scrutiny in Washington in a debate driven by Senator John McCain, a Republican from Arizona and the chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, and greatly inflamed by the indecency debate and lobbyists like Mr. Bozell. 
 Earlier this month, a bipartisan group of members of the House Commerce Committee, led by its chairman Joe L. Barton, Republican from Texas, and Nathan Deal, Republican from Georgia, asked the Federal Communications Commission chairman, Michael K. Powell, to review the feasibility of a la carte pricing and to provide its findings to the House committee by mid-November.
 Large cable operators view any such restructuring as a potential nightmare. ''Their fear is that consumers would not spend as much as they do now because they only pay for a limited number of channels,'' said Dennis H. Leibowitz, a longtime cable analyst who heads Act II Partners, a hedge fund that invests in media companies. 
 David L. Cohen, a spokesman for the Comcast Corporation, the country's largest cable operator, said a la carte pricing would ''limit the breadth of diverse programming available, jeopardize the fundamental economic model that permits emerging channels to flourish and could leave consumers with higher bills and fewer viewing options.''
 The National Cable Television Association argues that packaging has made possible a diversity of programming that has resulted in 339 national and 84 regional networks that may never have developed in an a la carte environment.
 Cable programming executives also prefer the status quo, called tiering. It lets them use the leverage of popular channels like MTV and TBS to help assure that their smaller services get carriage on basic tiers. They argue that it would become harder to support smaller existing channels or start new channels unless there was some assurance of wide distribution. 
 Programmers also argue that in an a la carte world, they would be forced to charge higher fees for individual networks so that some consumers could end up paying far more for services than they do now.
 In a open letter to Congress sent in early May, signed by a dozen cable programming executives -- including Pamela Thomas-Graham, president of CNBC, and Anne Sweeney, co-chairwoman of the Walt Disney Company's New Media Networks unit -- they argued that a la carte pricing would ''cause the demise of many existing cable program services and severely limit the creation of new ones.'' 
 According to data from the Television Bureau of Advertising, cable customers devote most of their viewing to about eight channels, while the average expanded basic cable package contains about 63 channels that generally includes networks like CNN, ESPN and MTV. 
 Opposition to tiered packages has continued to grow, in part as a result of the rapid rise of cable prices in the last several years. According to Bureau of Labor Statistics, since 1996, when the industry was effectively deregulated, cable prices have risen 56.4 percent. The consumer price index is up about 21.4 percent over the same period. 
 But for opponents of tiering, the issues are not purely economic. The flashpoint for conservative critics was the infamous Janet Jackson incident during the Super Bowl halftime show, which was produced by MTV for CBS. Both the cable channel and the network are owned by Viacom Inc. 
 ''If the average person could have disconnected MTV after that show,'' Mr. Bozell said, ''there would have been a giant clicking sound of people clicking it off across the country.'' 
 Consumers and conservatives have also won the support of the American Cable Association: a consortium of smaller cable operators that do not have the leverage to negotiate such favorable terms for programming as their larger counterparts and do not own stakes in cable networks that they might be seeking to protect. 
 ''It is still a David versus Goliath battle, but the intensity of the social conservatives in support of a la carte pricing has given the issue an enormous boost,'' said Gene Kimmelman, the public policy director for the Consumers Union, a consumer advocacy group based in Washington, and a longtime opponent of cable tiering. 
 As lobbying from both sides heated up earlier this year, the Discovery Channel sent a letter to Senator McCain noting that consumers pay about 34 cents a month for the cable channel under tiered plans. Judith A. McHale, the president of Discovery Communications Inc., said that its research found that the channel would cost about $6.33 a month in an a la carte world, but that consumers were not willing to spend more than $1.40 a month. Ms. McHale termed that a ''devastating, unintended consequence of an a la carte pricing structure.'' (Discovery is a partner of The New York Times in another cable channel.)
 Brian Dietz, a spokesman for the National Cable Television Association, says there is a simple solution for consumers who do not want certain channels that are part of the basic package. They simply have the cable company block them.
 But Mr. Kimmelman counters that customers would still be paying for programming they do not want.

HEADLINE: U.S. Steps Up Push Against Online Casinos By Seizing Cash

BYLINE: By MATT RICHTEL

 BODY:
Federal law enforcement officials routinely seize money they suspect is connected to activities like money laundering, terrorism or drug smuggling. But in early April, United States marshals seized $3.2 million from Discovery Communications, the television and media company, in an aggressive effort to crack down on a new target, Internet gambling.
 The money initially belonged to Tropical Paradise, a Costa Rica-based Internet casino operation, which in October paid Discovery for television spots to advertise an online poker room, ParadisePoker.com. According to court documents, the government seized the money and told Discovery, which is based in Silver Spring, Md., that it could be party to an illegal activity by broadcasting such advertisements.
 Federal prosecutors contend that online gambling sites are illegal, but the offshore casinos fall outside their jurisdiction. So for nearly a year, the government has been trying to curb the sites' activities by investigating and pressuring American companies that provide services to offshore gambling sites on the theory that they are ''aiding and abetting'' the operations. 
 Until now, the effort has largely involved seeking information from American companies, including major broadcasters, Web portals and industry consultants. The seizure of money significantly escalates the government's attack. 
 The move has raised strong criticism from First Amendment experts, media industry executives and people involved with offshore casinos. They assert that the federal government is relying on an untested legal theory in taking action against American companies, and using tactics more typically used against organized crime activities. 
 ''This is not drug money or terrorist money,'' said Rodney A. Smolla, dean of the University of Richmond School of Law. ''The fact it is being treated as such shows a crusader's zeal against offshore gambling.''
 The possible message being sent, legal experts said, is that any American company that does business with an offshore casino -- including software makers and consultants -- could be in danger of having proceeds from that business seized.
 ''This is a strategy of intimidating anybody who is in the chain of commerce,'' said Lawrence Walters, a lawyer who works with offshore Internet casinos, as well as software companies that do business with the casinos.
 The Justice Department declined to comment about this case or other investigations in this area. 
 Tens of millions of Americans place bets over the Internet, wagering on sporting events and on casino games like virtual blackjack, roulette and poker. But the casinos are outside the United States, typically in Costa Rica and the Caribbean or in Britain, where the operations are fully licensed and legal. 
 The legality of online betting is a complicated matter of some dispute in the United States. The government asserts that the federal Wire Act prohibits all Internet casinos, but the courts have been divided, legal scholars said.
 The individual states also have laws that prohibit any gambling enterprises that they do not formally authorize. Some states, but not all of them, make it illegal for individuals to place a recreational bet; New York, for instance, does not make it illegal to place a bet online.
 In June 2003, the Justice Department sent letters to trade groups representing major broadcasters and publishers, telling them their members could be violating the law by displaying advertisements on behalf of offshore casinos. The government said the businesses could be seen as aiding and abetting the activities of the casinos.
 Then, Raymond W. Gruender, the United States attorney in the Eastern District of Missouri, convened a grand jury, sending subpoenas to companies asking them to provide a broad range of information about their relationships with offshore casinos. The investigation had a significant impact. Some major broadcasters, including Infinity Broadcasting and Clear Channel Communications, stopped taking gambling ads last fall. Google and Yahoo, the Internet search engines, said in April that they would stop taking such advertisements.
 So far, executives at media companies have not voiced public challenges to the government campaign. An executive for one media company, who asked that his firm not be identified so as not to attract further attention from the Department of Justice, said that the government was promising to go easy on broadcasters and Internet sites that cooperate with its inquiry.
 The executive said he had heard from people involved in the investigation that the government might begin levying fines or pressing charges against media companies.
 The financial stakes are not insignificant. In court papers, Tropical Paradise, a Costa Rican casino operator, said it had entered into a contract, dated Oct. 5, to pay $3.5 million for advertising during broadcasts of the ''World Poker Tour'' on the Travel Channel, a part of Discovery Networks, which is a unit of Discovery Communications. (Discovery is a partner of The New York Times in another cable channel.)
 Under the contract, the Travel Channel was to broadcast 308 30-second commercials in a six-month period for ParadisePoker.com, where people can play virtual poker free or for pay.
 In a separate contract, dated Oct. 14, Tropical Paradise agreed to pay $350,000 to run advertisements on the Discovery Web site. According to the court papers, filed in federal district court in Maryland, Tropical Paradise paid the amount of the contracts in full, and was told the money would be refunded if the advertisements did not run.
 Indeed, only a small portion of the advertisements were broadcast. On Oct. 25, Discovery, after learning of the government's position about advertising of offshore gambling, told Tropical Paradise that it would cease broadcasting the commercials. According to court papers, the parties agreed Discovery would refund the money for commercials that did not run.
 But Tropical Paradise never got its money back, and in April it sued Discovery for breach of contract in federal district court in Maryland, asserting that it is owed $3.25 million for the unperformed portion of the two contracts. In response to the lawsuit, Discovery, without challenging Tropical Paradise's right to the money, said it no longer had the money because it had been seized by the United States marshals on April 6. 
 ''The issues presented by this case are intertwined with an ongoing criminal investigation (and seizure of money) conducted by the United States Department of Justice of offshore online gambling operations,'' according to Discovery's court filing on May 7.
 Sanford Saunders, a partner for Greenberg Traurig, a law firm representing Tropical Paradise, said Discovery should not have taken the money in the first place if it had doubts about the legality of the advertising. ''Discovery knew our business,'' Mr. Saunders said. ''They knew the purpose of our advertising, and they told us this could be legally done.'' 
 The issues are considerably broader than a contract dispute between the two companies, said Mr. Smolla, the dean of the University of Richmond law school. It is not clear that the operators of offshore casinos are violating federal law, he noted. And he said there are First Amendment protections that apply to broadcasters, which could weaken any case against them in this context. 
 The issues are made even murkier because federal prosecutors are trying to extend their reach to companies operating legally overseas. The World Trade Organization in March issued a preliminary ruling that said the United States is violating its free-trade obligations by prohibiting online gambling operations.
 Some members of Congress reacted angrily to the W.T.O. ruling, calling it an effort to extend the values of other countries to the United States. 
 But that argument could be applied to federal actions as well, Mr. Smolla said.
 ''It's an extraordinary exercise of American hubris to say that we have the right to seize the money,'' Mr. Smolla said. ''This is a global worldwide and economic network, and we're using this vehicle to extend our laws into another nation in a very aggressive way.''

HEADLINE: Salvaging Jewish Heritage in China, Block by Block

BYLINE: By SHERIDAN PRASSO

 BODY:
Every morning at 5 Christopher Choa gets up for his daily run, logging 8 to 10 miles on his trip to and from the North Bund, which includes the old Jewish ghetto in Shanghai. 
 A New York architect who moved to Shanghai three years ago, Mr. Choa became enchanted by the area and its history. So when he learned that the North Bund was facing redevelopment, he decided to try to save as much of the old ghetto as possible. 
 ''The history of the Jews in Shanghai is so compelling,'' said Mr. Choa, who is Roman Catholic, but whose great-grandmother was a Sephardic Jew. ''It's really worth preserving. It's part of the fabric.''
 The ghetto, in what was once the American and then the International Settlement and is now called the North Bund, harbored more than 20,000 Jews who fled Nazi Europe from 1933 to 1941 and another 5,000 to 10,000 who fled Stalin's Russia before that. Viewers of Steven Spielberg's 1987 film ''Empire of the Sun'' got a glimpse of the area. Known in Chinese as Hongkou (or Hongkew), the ghetto was a haven for stateless refugees in a city that for years did not require a visa to enter.
 Almost all the Jews, except a few descendants of mixed parentage, resettled in New York, Los Angeles, Tel Aviv and elsewhere as the Communists took power in 1949. They left behind a charming neighborhood with row houses, schools, a synagogue, a park and even a Little Vienna Cafe. The district is now inhabited by working-class Chinese, some of whom live in rooms lighted by a single hanging bulb and with three or more families sharing a kitchen and bathroom. When Shanghai officials announced urban renewal plans for the North Bund almost two years ago, they said they envisioned turning the area into a masterpiece of the 21st century, a modern business and residential district with skyscrapers, apartment buildings, cruise ship docks and even an enormous Ferris wheel.
 The gleaming metropolis that city planners had in mind did not leave room for a quaint old neighborhood. Officials had earmarked about 400 historic buildings for preservation citywide, but in the old ghetto only the Ohel Moshe Synagogue and a block or so of row houses made the list.
 Mr. Choa had a different idea. He and his New York-based architecture firm, HLW International, entered a competition to design a master plan for the new North Bund. HLW, along with two other firms, the Cox Group of Australia and RTKL Associates of Baltimore, won.
 Mr. Choa, who had already restored the Art Deco lobbies of the Park Hotel and the Peace Hotel annex, architectural jewels from the era when Shanghai was known as the Paris of the East, has experience in environmentally sensitive design. The centerpiece of his plan is creating a memorial park around the synagogue, where there are now buildings, and bringing in gravestones of Jewish residents from former cemeteries. He says his idea would symbolically link the park to the Huangpu River on one end and an ornate Buddhist temple on the other.
 Yet creating the park would mean saving only a few more of the ghetto buildings than the city required, Mr. Choa said. By tearing down some of the row houses, developers, who would be chosen by the government, could build more profitable high-rises.
 ''The choice was to keep the housing or put in a park,'' he said. ''Park space was so underrepresented. I thought the park was more important.'' 
 ''I agonized a lot about what to do in this area,'' he added, calling the decision a ''Faustian bargain.''
 Mr. Choa said that no matter what he proposed, much of the ghetto could be torn down anyway. ''There's no guarantee that even a municipal-preserved building will stay,'' he said.
 But momentum is growing to preserve the entire neighborhood. An alternate plan has been drawn up by two Canadians, Ian Leventhal and Thomas M. Rado, who are Jewish. They formed a company called Living Bridge, that is trying to raise $450 million to preserve at least 50 ghetto buildings in a nine-block area.
 ''Our plan calls for the restoration of all the buildings of significant architectural importance, such as the row houses, the Broadway Theater and of course the Ohel Moshe Synagogue,'' Mr. Leventhal wrote in an e-mail message, though he declined to say how much money has been raised. 
 Mr. Leventhal and Mr. Rado, who are working with government-appointed preservation professors from a Shanghai university and a Toronto architect, made a presentation to district officials in Hongkou last Monday. If district officials can be convinced of the financial viability of the Leventhal-Rado restoration plan -- which also calls for a boutique hotel, an extensive memorial park and a car-free pedestrian zone -- it would then go to the Shanghai city government for consideration when they auction the area to developers. 
 ''In principle the government is supportive, and our next step is to do a more detailed version for presentation early this summer,'' Mr. Leventhal said, adding that he hoped to set a precedent for heritage conservation and development.
 The Ohel Moshe Synagogue is already a tourist attraction. No longer used for worship (Judaism is not officially recognized by the Chinese government), the synagogue operates as a small museum and Jewish cultural center supported by donations. A museum plaque listing visitors during the last few years includes photos of Hillary Rodham Clinton, former Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder of Germany and former Israeli Prime Ministers Yitzhak Rabin and Benjamin Netanyahu. 
 Because Shanghai has not decided which redevelopment path to take, no one knows what, if any, buildings beyond the synagogue and the row-house block will be preserved. All Mr. Choa, Mr. Leventhal and Mr. Rado can do is keep urging government officials to consider the tourism potential of the district so that they in turn might transfer that pressure onto future developers. 
 ''You're just trying to save as much as possible,'' Mr. Choa said.

HEADLINE: What Studs Terkel's 'Working' Says About Worker Malaise Today

BYLINE: By ADAM COHEN

 BODY:
Babe Secoli, a supermarket checker for nearly 30 years, is proud of her dexterity in moving items along the conveyor belt. If asked, she will do a little dance, showing how she hits the keys on the cash register with one hand, pushes the food along with the other and intermittently whacks the conveyor-belt button with her hip. She knows what everything costs -- the price list on the register is, she says, only ''for the part-time girls.'' Almost everything amuses her, especially the rich ladies who drop in to shoplift meat. ''I'm a couple of days away,'' she says, ''I'm very lonesome for this place.''
 Ms. Secoli's is one of the dozens of throaty, acerbic voices in ''Working,'' Studs Terkel's oral history of working life, which was published 30 years ago this spring. When it appeared, ''Working'' was a revelation, a window on the thoughts of Americans who were rarely heard from: hospital aides, skycaps, gravediggers. Many of the interviews follow a similar, surprising trajectory, beginning with mundane workplace details but quickly moving on to existential thoughts. Even for the lowliest laborers, Mr. Terkel found, work was a search, sometimes successful, sometimes not, ''for daily meaning as well as daily bread.'' 
 The oral histories in ''Working'' are wistful dispatches from a distant era. The early 1970's were the waning days of the old economy, when modern management practices and computers were just beginning to transform the American workplace. In the last 30 years, productivity has soared, but job satisfaction has plummeted. It is hard to read ''Working'' without thinking about what has gone wrong in the workplace.
 Mr. Terkel's ragtag collection of little-guy monologues was a runaway best seller. Part of its appeal was the unusual, occasionally illicit glimpses it offered into the ways of the world. ''If you work nights and it's real quiet, I don't think there's an operator who hasn't listened in on calls,'' a switchboard operator says. ''The night goes faster.'' A gas-meter reader tells of the codes meter men put on customer cards when there was an attractive woman in the house.
 Mr. Terkel's interlocutors also offer deeper insights. A parking lot attendant holds forth on why working people are better tippers than Cadillac drivers. A prostitute reflects that she was ''the kind of hustler who received money for favors granted,'' not the kind who ''signs a lifetime contract for her trick,'' or who ''carefully reads women's magazines and learns what it is proper to give for each date, depending on how much . . . [he] spends on her.''
 It is striking how many of Mr. Terkel's subjects have found the meaning he says they are looking for. ''Obviously I don't make much money,'' a bookbinder says, but she still loves repairing old books because ''a book is a life.'' A gravedigger recalls how impressed a visiting sewer digger was with his neat lines and square edges. ''A human body is goin' into this grave,'' he says proudly. ''That's why you need skill when you're gonna dig a grave.''
 There are disgruntled workers in ''Working,'' who feel caged in by their jobs, but many others exult in their ability to demonstrate their competence, to show off their personality and to perform. ''When I put the plate down, you don't hear a sound,'' a waitress says. ''If I drop a fork, there is a certain way I pick it up. I know they can see how delicately I do it. I'm on stage.''
 The 1970's were a slower age, and much of the workers' pleasure in their jobs is related to the less-demanding time clock. A hospital billing agent can take time off from dunning patients to look in on a man whose leg was amputated, who has no one to care for him. ''If he's going to live in a third-floor flat and he doesn't have anybody home, this bothers me,'' she says. A stewardess says she is supposed to spend a half-hour on a Boston to Los Angeles flight socializing with passengers.
 Three decades later, we are caught up in what a recent book dubbed ''The New Ruthless Economy.'' High tech and new management styles put workers on what the author Simon Head calls ''digital assembly lines'' with little room for creativity or independent thought. As much as 4 percent of the work force is now employed in call centers, reading canned scripts and being supervised with methods known as ''management by stress.'' Doctors defer to managed-care administrators and practice speed medicine: in 1997, they spent an average of eight minutes talking to a patient, less than half the time they spent a decade earlier.
 It is much the same in other fields. There have been substantial productivity gains. But those gains have not found their way to paychecks. In a recent two-and-a-half-year period, corporate profits surged 87 percent, while wages rose just 4.5 percent. Not surprisingly, a study last fall by the Conference Board found that less than 49 percent of workers were satisfied with their jobs, down from 59 percent in 1995.
 When ''Working'' was written, these trends were just visible on the horizon. A neighborhood druggist laments ''the corner drugstore, that's kinda fadin' now,'' because little shops like his can't compete. ''Most of us, like the assembly line worker, have jobs that are too small for our spirit,'' an editor says. ''Jobs are not big enough for people.''
 When America begins to pay attention to its unhappy work force -- and eventually, it must -- ''Working'' will still provide important insights, with its path-breaking exploration of what Mr. Terkel described as ''the extraordinary dreams of ordinary people.''

HEADLINE: SAUDI MILITARY STORMS COMPLEX TO FREE HOSTAGES

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR

DATELINE: KHOBAR, Saudi Arabia, May 30 

 BODY:
Saudi commandos in helicopters stormed an upscale residential complex in this oil center on Sunday, freeing most of the dozens of Westerners and other foreigners who had been trapped by four armed militants in the compound's hotel for 24 hours. The militants killed 22 people, the Interior Ministry announced.
 Twenty-five people were wounded, according to a ministry statement carried by the official Saudi press agency. It also said the militants began the siege of the compound by vaulting over a fence, after their attempt to drive a car booby-trapped with explosives into the compound had failed.
 The militants' leader was critically wounded and captured, the statement said, but three other gunmen held hostages at gunpoint and used them as cover to escape in a stolen car. It was unclear what happened to those hostages, but checkpoints set up on major highways around this city on the Persian Gulf were examining all cars. 
 The attack on Saturday on the luxurious complex, known as the Oasis Residential Resorts, was the second brazen assault this month against the Saudi oil industry, which is heavily dependent on foreigners, and statements of responsibility attributed to Al Qaeda quickly appeared on Arab Islamist Web sites.
 Moreover, the attack came as Saudi Arabia is trying to increase production to ease pressure on record global oil prices. The psychological impact of the Oasis attack on the major oil markets in New York and London, which are closed on Monday, remained to be seen. [Page A11.]
 In the tense finale of the Oasis attack, the Saudi commandos were shown on television leaping from helicopters onto the roof of a building in the compound. Of the 22 victims, including an American, 9 were killed in or around the Oasis, a luxurious guesthouse that features amenities like an ice-skating rink. The militants had held the resort overnight, apparently picking off victims as they encountered them.
 ''They were found all over the place, some of them in the corridors and others near the entrance and some on the steps,'' said one Saudi witness. He said most appeared to be either Indian or Filipino, except for two Westerners.
 Details of the assault and the mopping-up operation remained murky. The Saudi Interior Ministry statement said 41 hostages had been rescued by the commandos, but a Western diplomat explained that they were not all held together in the hotel, a five-story building constructed around a courtyard swimming pool. The diplomat said some had been hiding to avoid being killed by the gunmen who seized the place.
 ''The gunmen were going through the compound and either shooting people or letting them go,'' the Western diplomat said. ''They shot non-Muslims and they let the Muslims go.''
 The Oasis attack was the first large-scale assault in the heart of the kingdom's oil-producing region along the Persian Gulf, and followed a similarly brazen assault on foreign oil workers in the Saudi city of Yanbu on May 1.
 Prince Bandar bin Sultan, the Saudi ambassador to the United States, and other senior government officials sought to reassure world oil markets that production continued uninterrupted. The Saudi oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, was reportedly meeting with Western officials and oil company executives to reassure them that the attacks would not affect oil supplies.
 ''The terrorists' goal is to disrupt the Saudi economy and destabilize our country,'' Prince Bandar said in a statement released in Washington. ''But they will not succeed. With every desperate act of violence, our effort and resolve to destroy the terrorists only grows.''
 Prince Bandar also told Fox News that seven Americans had been rescued from the compound. Diplomats in the kingdom said he was referring to seven American government workers who lived at the compound and had managed to elude capture by the militants, although two of them suffered gunshot wounds that were not life-threatening.
 The total of 242 people evacuated from the Oasis compound -- also home to executives for leading firms like Royal Dutch/Shell, Total and Lukoil -- were taken either to hospitals or nearby hotels, depending on their condition.
 A group affiliated with Al Qaeda, the network whose founder Osama bin Laden has vowed to disrupt the close ties between the kingdom and the West, took responsibility for the attack through an unsubstantiated claim on a Web site associated with the militants. It threatened to drive all ''crusaders'' from ''the land of Islam.'' In a taped statement posted on Islamist Web sites, Abdulaziz al-Muqrin, a reputed leader of Al Qaeda in Saudi Arabia, promised that the coming months would be ''bloody and miserable for infidels.''
 Saudi and other analysts suggest that it is likely that Qaeda admirers, rather than the organization itself, were responsible. Much like the bloody assault in Yanbu, which left six Westerners and a Saudi dead, the Oasis attack, against a site used mainly by Westerners, appeared intended to create maximum carnage.
 That suggests that the terrorists are getting weaker, rather than stronger, the analysts believe, because they are unable to attack anything substantial. A crackdown that was started after three suicide attacks killed 35 people including the bombers in Riyadh last May has seriously hampered their ability to organize.
 ''It reflects a late stage in the life of these groups because when they are very weak, they choose very easy targets with very bloody results,'' said Hassan Abu Taleb, an expert on Saudi affairs at Al Ahram Center for Political and Strategic studies in Cairo. ''They want something that causes the maximum propaganda and media impact to try to show that they are strong.''
 Before hitting the Oasis complex, the attackers had opened fire at the Khobar Petroleum Center building, which houses the offices of numerous Western firms, and shot their way through another building used by Apicorp, the Arab Petroleum Investment Corporation. An Egyptian schoolboy was among those killed there.
 ''These targets are not strategic,'' Mr. Abu Taleb noted. ''They did not attack oil fields for example, so it has no affect on the grip of the Saudi royal family.'' 
 Such strikes mean that the level of violence may not drop any time soon, because there are literally thousands of places in the kingdom for anyone with a gun to shoot at Westerners.
 Expatriate residents of the Eastern Province, where the kingdom's oil production is centered, said they expected a large exodus at least of families once the school year ends. The American Embassy repeated its April 15 warning that all Americans should depart the kingdom.
 Many Saudis expressed revulsion over the attacks, but there were a few gloating messages on extremist Web sites that some of the militants had been able to elude capture.
 Khobar is also the name of the barracks in nearby Dhahran that were the site of a terrorist attack in 1996, when 19 American servicemen died from a huge truck bomb. In hindsight it was labeled a Qaeda attack.
 Crown Prince Abdullah, the country's actual ruler in the face of King Fahd's longstanding infirmity, reiterated the kingdom's determination to stamp out the militants.
 In the short run, analysts said, they are aided by the fact that each such attack tends to persuade people to unite around the ruling family. But in the long run, they said, police operations alone will not work because the extremists are rooted in the same Wahhabi religious tenets as the royal family.
 ''The security solution is not enough; these are ideological groups who want to topple the regime itself,'' said Abdel Rahman al-Lahem, a Saudi lawyer and expert in Islamist movements. The tradition of leaving public discourse up to the religious alone has to be abandoned for a broader base, he suggested.
 The extremists were evidently returning to attacking Westerners because their recent attacks -- including a car-bombing in Riyadh in April and an attack on a compound there last November -- had mostly killed Saudis and other Muslims.
 The Saudi Interior Ministry said the dead from the Oasis attack were one American, eight Indians, one Briton, two Sri Lankans, one Egyptian child, one Swede, one Italian, one South African, three Filipinos and three Saudis.
 Barrie Peach, the spokesman for the British Embassy, identified the dead Briton as Michael Hamilton, 61, who had spent 25 years working in the region and was vice president for projects at Apicorp, one of the businesses attacked Saturday.
 The Italian Foreign Ministry identified the dead Italian as Antonio Amato, 25, who had arrived in the kingdom in recent weeks to work as a cook at the Oasis complex.

HEADLINE: Gaps Seen in 'Virtual Border' Security System

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF and ERIC LICHTBLAU

 BODY:
Computer scientists and engineers are raising questions about a government plan to create a multibillion-dollar computer system of ''virtual borders'' intended to identify would-be terrorists entering the United States.
 On Tuesday, the Department of Homeland Security plans to announce the award of a contract to extend the reach of its program, called U.S.-Visit, to permit the Customs service to capture fingerprints and other profile information on hundreds of millions of people who enter or leave the United States each year.
 The system, which investigators estimate could cost as much as $15 billion over 10 years, is intended to help officials determine who should be prohibited from entering the country, to identify visitors who have overstayed or violated the terms of their admission, and to help law enforcement agencies track those who should be detained.
 Supporters of the system argue that the database would have provided the means to apprehend some of the Sept. 11 terrorists who were known to the F.B.I., but, they say, could not be located before the attack. 
 The critics include some computer scientists and technologists, who maintain that the government has had a bad record in building computerized systems based on unproved technology. ''All you have to do is look at the track record of other government agencies,'' said Willis H. Ware, a scientist at the RAND Corporation and a computer industry pioneer. The Internal Revenue Service, NASA and the Federal Aviation Administration have all fumbled large projects, he said.
 The system will capture biometric data, like fingerprints, photographs and voiceprints, at 211 visa-issuing posts overseas beginning in October. It is intended as an early warning, providing customs and border officials instant access to a web of databases storing intelligence and law enforcement watch lists, profile data and information from foreign governments.
 Computer scientists and security experts said that the problem facing border officials was in many ways similar to some of those faced by designers of antiballistic missile defenses. Despite decades of development work, antimissile systems cannot reliably detect and home in on enemy missiles that may be hidden in clouds of decoys.
 Similarly, border control systems might detect individuals who appear in law enforcement or intelligence databases but provide little protection against attackers not yet known to the government.
 ''Trying to do some of these things is just beyond what we are able to do,'' said Nancy Levison, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology computer scientist who is an expert in complex systems and safety issues. ''Look how long it took to get the baggage system at the new Denver airport to work.''
 Moreover, critics said the Department of Homeland Security had given the three contractors who are bidding on the project -- Accenture, Lockheed Martin and the Computer Sciences Corporation -- wide latitude in specifying the technology and capabilities of the U.S.-Visit system. In the past, government contracts for unproved technologies that were poorly defined have frequently been saddled with problems and led to big cost overruns.
 ''The government doesn't know how to buy software,'' said Barbara Corn, a retired software engineer who has served on NASA advisory panels. ''They never have the requirements nailed down.''
 A Homeland Security Department spokesman, Dennis Murphy, replied that the initial phase of the U.S.-Visit project had come in on time and under budget. ''It's not just theoretical now,'' Mr. Murphy said. ''We know how the system works.''
 While acknowledging that it was almost impossible to catch terrorists without previous records or matching intelligence data, he said the system was intended to minimize the risk. ''There is an enormous intelligence-gathering capability worldwide,'' Mr. Murphy added, ''and we're working with partners around the world to feed information into our systems.''
 Accenture said its approach had been proved in other contracts like a project for the Defense Logistics Agency, where it had established that it could save tax money. ''We have proven out the return on investment,'' said Eric Sting, project leader on Accenture's bid for the U.S.-Visit system. ''We think there is a very compelling business rationale.''
 In addition to concerns about program management, several computer security experts warned that even if a system worked it might not justify the investment.
 This point was first raised by the General Accounting Office in October 2002 in a review of the state of biometric identification techniques. It examined seven technologies that might be used for border control, including facial recognition, fingerprint recognition, hand geometry, iris recognition, retina recognition, signature recognition and speaker recognition. The agency estimated that such a system might cost $1.3 billion to $2.9 billion and then $700 million to $1.5 billion a year to operate.
 ''Whether the financial and nonfinancial costs are warranted by the benefits of greater security is a policy issue that should be determined before biometric technologies are implemented in a border control system,'' the report concluded.
 A supplier of biometric equipment has also raised questions. VAS International, an Atlanta company that specializes in voice-recognition technology, has been lobbying in Washington against the way that biometrics have been used in some projects, saying it led to false positives and negatives.
 The company noted the failure of the matricula consular card issued by Mexico, which is supposed to be secure. Arrests of illegal aliens have turned up repeated cases of people with more than one forged card.
 ''U.S.-Visit isn't really designed to keep the terrorists out,'' said Marc E. Nolan, president of VAS International, which has sent a report to Congressional officials about what the company regards as drawbacks in the program.
 He argued that restricting it to facial recognition -- which has run into problems in some tests -- or to other individual methods could cause problems because there are no strict standards in place. ''To have one be the panacea for all of them isn't going to work,'' he said, adding that a varied approach was needed. 
 Critics also challenge the value of the basic goal of real-time ability for the system. Although this means that data would be immediately available on central control and border inspection computers, military analysts say there is a risk in coping with the vast amount of information that would be uncovered by a real-time tracking system. 
 ''What the designers may have missed is the cost of false positives and false negatives in this kind of system,'' said Michael Schrage, a research associate at the M.I.T. Security Studies Program, who is concerned that so many alerts would be generated that it would be impossible to keep up with the deluge. ''The whole notion of defining this problem as real time may be the challenge,'' he said. ''What are the trade-offs?''
 The Homeland Security Department's spokesman, Mr. Murphy, said that from experience so far, false positives would not be a major problem. He acknowledged that ''one of the big issues with any big project like this is false positives.'' But the agency, he said, had processed more than four million travelers since January using photos and prints, and the false positive rate was less than one-tenth of 1 percent.
 Several computer scientists also raised questions about the prospects for success of a project that had not been adequately tested.
 ''The real question,'' said Gordon Bell, a Microsoft computer researcher and former official at the National Science Foundation, ''is how much homework have they done. They should have been running tests two years ago. When you build a big system, the key thing is to run some small experiments first.''

HEADLINE: New Teachers, New Pupils and Schools With Revolving Doors

BYLINE: By PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS 

 BODY:
Some nights when she is having trouble sleeping, Jennifer Noble awakens to a yellow beam of light flickering through the mini-blinds. A tow truck in the distance, its rude light flashing, is a sure sign of a Las Vegas dawn, soon to be joined by cement mixers and school buses.
 From her bedroom window, past the streetlights along a stretch of gravel in this nowhere becoming somewhere -- a new development she describes as ''a bunch of dirt to the left of the highway'' on the Las Vegas Valley's far northwest fringes -- Mrs. Noble can dimly make out the green roofs of the new James H. Bilbray Elementary School, where she is a second-grade teacher. The school's crisp profile is surrealistically joined by that of an even newer school, its back-to-back mirror image, still under construction.
 Mrs. Noble, 34, is one of more than 2,000 new teachers recruited last year from all corners of the United States by the Clark County School District, by far the fastest-growing district in the country. Schools like Bilbray Elementary are tenuous outposts of community in glue-stick landscapes of newness. The schools, many named not for trees, towns or presidents but for living people -- in Bilbray's case, a former congressman -- are overflowing with the children of families seeking precisely the un-glamorous suburban life that millions of tourists flock here to escape. 
 Bilbray, which opened last fall, and Scherkenbach, its twin, opening this fall, are part of a school building boom practically biblical in scale. (Rhodes Elementary begat Heckethorn; Heckethorn begat Bilbray; Bilbray begat Scherkenbach.) 
 Every morning at 8:55 on the dot, Mrs. Noble, who has a 4-year-old son and 19-month-old twin daughters, greets her exuberant hive of second graders at the metal steps leading up to Portable 5, or P5, one of 10 trailer-like classrooms parked at the edge of the playground to handle the throngs of students who enrolled even before the school opened. 
 ''The portable,'' its ceiling tiles decorated with bright butterflies with coffee-filter wings, is an apt metaphor for Jennifer Noble's unsettled year. Like so many Las Vegas pilgrims, Mrs. Noble, a veteran teacher of radiant calm whose features evoke Vermeer, moved here after giving up on California. She had lived there as a child and moved back with her husband, Chris, but after their twins arrived, the couple realized that the salaries of even an experienced teacher and a talented young chef did not jibe with California's vaunted promise.
 ''It was a practical decision, and I'm a very emotional person,'' she said, driving down the interstate on her daily after-school run to pick up the twins from day care and Jeremiah from preschool, a journey she will repeat at the crack of dawn. ''I've had an un-me kind of a year.''
 In the Tilt-A-Whirl that is Las Vegas, Mrs. Noble began the year as a fourth-grade teacher at Nellis Air Force Base, on the other far side of the Valley, only to be told, on a Wednesday afternoon a month and a half into her new job, that she was being ''surplused'' -- shuffled from a school with low enrollment to one sequencing new arrivals like a strung-out air traffic control tower (Bilbray, projected to open with 687 students, now has 1,102). She had only a few hours to take down her bulletin boards and cute bug wall borders, stuff them in her trunk and head to a meeting of 50 other newly surplused teachers vying for new assignments. Bilbray was close to home, in an area so new it kept having to add crossing guards as streets were finished.

Moving In, Moving On
 Life in Mrs. Noble's class has been similarly disjointed. She started October with 10 students, including Ashley, Chelsea, Jayce, Ciarra and Oswaldo, each from different states or schools. A week later Tony arrived, then Brandon, Anna, Ryan and Anthony. One or two second graders each week, until the class hit the maximum 18. 
 Each fresh face means a new cubby label, a new date on the birthday board, a new job on the job chart and rejiggered reading groups. Spelling tests and writing workshops, meanwhile, compete with the bleating and groaning of earth movers raising high Scherkenbach Elementary, to which Mrs. Noble will be surplused in the fall.
 As the teacher, she is supposed to be the anchor. ''This is my 11th year of teaching, and it's been by far my hardest year ever. I have been trying to find a common ground with these kiddos, and I still haven't found it. We've kind of piecemealed it together. I have a lot of satellites, a lot of kids orbiting around each other.''
 She'll lie awake at night, her head whirring, worrying that neither her pupils nor her own children are getting enough of her, feeling, as she describes her life, ''like an at-home mom in a working woman's body.'' 
 ''How are the mealworms doing?'' she asks Jeremiah on the way home, following an obstacle course of traffic cones, taking a left at the detour sign, right at the bulldozer.
 ''The worm pooped.''
 ''Did you get to watch it? 
 The minivan barely contains his ecstasy: ''He was twisted when he pooped!''
 Since December, Mrs. Noble has held down the household almost single-handedly -- laying out clothes and packing diaper bags before bed, getting up at 5, dressing the children, making lunches, grabbing a PB&J for Jeremiah's breakfast, doing the two-stop shuttle and arriving at school at 8:20. 
 It has been this way since her husband, who had shouldered most of the child care in California, typed ''chef'' on the help-wanted Web site of the local paper. Up popped a notice for Bouchon, a bistro at the Venetian being opened by the chef Thomas Keller. 
 Now Mr. Noble, 37, a production sous-chef, works 15-hour days, arriving at 6 a.m. to supervise the blanching of fava beans, the pin-boning of salmon, the roasting of bones for stock. Sometimes he greets Dungeness crabs at the airport. Mrs. Noble, meanwhile, lunches on a gas-station burrito microwaved in the teachers' lounge, makes hot dogs for four on the fly or grabs dinner at a drive-through McDonald's, pizza being too hard to maneuver with the double stroller.
 The Nobles often talk by cellphone after midnight, he from the Venetian parking lot, she from home. That is late for her, but after days like a recent one with two hours of ''bloodcurdling screaming'' by the twins, she treasures his soothing voice.
 They met in New Jersey, where she had moved during ''the ick years'' of middle school, she 17, he 21. Ten years later, after a stop-start courtship, they decided to marry, their lives like the Venn diagram she draws on the second-grade blackboard, two circles sharing a hard-won common soul. They spent their honeymoon on a Ryder truck moving to California, where at a time when state school budgets were more flush, four job offers awaited. 
 She had wanted to be a teacher for as long as she could remember, motivated by her second-grade teacher in San Ramon, Calif., who had curly brown hair and wore ''teacher dresses'' -- long frumpy jumpers Mrs. Noble refuses to wear. ''It was the feeling she gave us,'' she recalls. ''She was happy and warm, like a mom. I wanted to have that effect on someone.''
 In Rocklin, north of Sacramento, she taught kindergarten, living with Chris and Jeremiah in an apartment. Everything changed when the twins came. ''We woke up one morning when the girls were brand new and knew it wasn't going to get any better,'' she said. On her maternity leave, they loaded the minivan and drove to Las Vegas, which she knew was desperate for teachers. She interviewed on a Friday, and an offer came six weeks later.
 They rented at first but saw their dream eroding with each breathless billboard announcing homes at prices that marched up: low 100's to high 100's to high 200's.
 They heard about a new development in a part of the Valley once considered halfway to Reno. There was no road through the cactus and creosote, only coordinates. They were seventh on a 52-person waiting list, buying a three-bedroom house not yet built in a neighborhood yet to exist. Even now, tripping over plastic tarps and other construction debris blown in overnight from the dunescape beside them, she is astonished by their leap of faith. ''I looked at it and thought, 'I'd never live in a place like this,''' she said of the relentless march of red tile roofs. ''You know what? I get it now.''

Creating Instant Tradition
 This is Bilbray country: the far side of Brent Lane, still redolent of horses in the cool morning air; the school side crisscrossed by streets with perfumed names like Blushing River and Crimson Rain.
 In her portable classroom, as each day begins, Mrs. Noble always feels a sense of optimism. ''Morning, Curtis.'' ''How ya doin' today, Sid?'' ''Hi, Ashley -- I like your dress today.'' She then begins the morning's spelling and punctuation exercise, Vegas style:
 1. it'l be fun too go to Mandalay together
 2. the shark reef acquarium there is awesome
 School begins 10 minutes before the official start time, for a schoolwide song and Drop Everything and Read time, two of many rituals dreamed up by the principal, Bridget Bilbray-Phillips, eldest daughter of the congressman, to foster community. 
 Mrs. Bilbray-Phillips runs the school with prim efficiency, her eyes everywhere. In a school without trophies, where the volleyballs, climbing rings and jump ropes are new, history becomes a matter of ingenuity. The main hall is plastered with a lovingly assembled ''patchwork of memories'' celebrating the life and times of Mr. Bilbray, a congressman from 1987 to 1995. A first-grade mural cum shrine commemorates his wedding reception at the Dunes, his family vacations in Hawaii, his bulldog, Butch.
 The former congressman, who shows up at major school events, is a figure to hang instant tradition on. On this mobile frontier, some of Mrs. Noble's pupils do not remember the names of the schools they have just come from. 
 Many pupils are veterans of multiple schools, the result not of family moves but of the ever-shifting boundaries of schools rising out of Las Vegas dust. Bilbray, for instance, is the fourth school for Zachary Plummer, a fourth grader. ''Unfortunately, Zach has had to harden up a bit,'' said his mother, Teresa Plummer. ''As his mom, you hate to see that happening at such a young age. He'll pick and choose who he makes friends with based on who will move into the zoning area.''
 Marcia Washington, the school counselor, notices that in Las Vegas, ''Kids don't have those best-friend-type relationships anymore. They'll have a one-year best friend.''
 Jennifer Noble wants her classroom to be the opposite of portable, as comforting and predictable as the rocking chair in the reading corner. A poster taped to the shaky walls expresses the way she views children. ''See me beautiful,'' it reads. ''Look for the best in me. It's what I really am.''
 When Brianna, a ''sweet blue-eyed doll,'' arrived in P5 from Alabama, carrying her new binder and notebooks, she looked as if she was here to stay. ''She fit in like a glove,'' Mrs. Noble said. ''She didn't miss a beat.''
 Four days later, Brianna's father pulled up in the parking lot after dismissal, honking the horn. Brianna came running back. Mrs. Noble felt her little arms grip the back of her waist, heard the tears before she even saw her face. Brianna told her she was moving that very day. She didn't know where.
 In Brianna's desk, Mrs. Noble's students found the burgundy wool cap with the red stripe that Brianna wore. ''Where did Brianna go?'' they asked. ''Why did she leave so fast?'' ''Why didn't she say goodbye?''
 Every night, Mrs. Noble would think of her, each morning look for her in the single-file line outside P5. ''In this career, you get attached,'' she said. ''When they disappear, it's like a piece of you disappearing. You want to look out for them, and you can't.''
 She pulled Brianna's desk away, ''to make the team tighter,'' and put it in the corner for the next arrival. Eventually, she will take the wool hat to the lost and found. But for now, she keeps it on the coat hook by the door, waiting.

HEADLINE: Neighborhood of U.S. Base Is Hot Real Estate in Korea

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, May 24 

 BODY:
''Yongsan, grab it while you can!'' beckoned advertisements for apartments bordering the American military headquarters on the Korean peninsula. ''Korea's Central Park that will change the map of Seoul!''
 Try to grab it they did. About 250,000 potential buyers recently put down a total of $6 billion in deposits, hoping to be chosen for one of the 629 apartments or 141 offices in the City Park towers. 
 For now, the color of this sprawling downtown base is not park green, but United States Army green. But, suddenly, Seoul's hottest real estate is ringing an American base that in more normal times is ringed with the riot police.
 Three years from now, when new owners are to move into the 39-story City Park towers, most of the 7,000 American soldiers are to be moving out, ending the presence of foreign soldiers at Yongsan since 1882.
 First, troops of China's Qing dynasty seized this strategic site between the Han River and Korea's royal court. About 25 years later, the occupiers of Yongsan, or Dragon Hill, were Japanese Imperial Army troops who established their military headquarters there. Today's tenants, American troops, live behind cinder block walls topped with barbed wire, esthetic scars that evoke a Fort Leavenworth transplanted from Kansas to Korea. (The American military recently announced that 3,600 American soldiers would move to Iraq from South Korea, reducing the American troop strength here by 10 percent.) 
 ''Whoever rules Yongsan, rules Korea,'' is the old refrain. In a new twist, today's rulers are players in Seoul's real estate bubble, a commercial frenzy that evokes Tokyo's bubble of the late 1980's.
 ''We are now the No. 1 destination for development in Seoul,'' Jeon Young Sik, a 31-year-old marketer for the City Park towers, said in an office festooned with posters for other projects in the long-neglected neighborhood: Megatrium, Yongsan Eclat, Daewoo Trump World III and a tower cluster to rise in the red-light district near the base.
 The target for these billions of dollars in investments is a run-down neighborhood of bars, discount shops and apartment buildings built low enough to allow military helicopters to take off and land.
 ''Compared to the air-brushed advertisements, this site is not that great a location,'' admitted Kim Su Yeon, whose father put down almost $1 million for a 2,060-square-foot apartment in City Park. ''So, yes, I see a big bubble.''
 Under an agreement near completion, American troops stationed here are to move over the next three years to an expanded base at Pyongtaek, a city 40 miles south. 
 An American pullout from Yongsan would provide 656 acres of open space to the 10 million residents of Seoul, a city where parks were sacrificed in the rush to create the world's 12th-largest economy. Almost overnight, Seoul, one of Asia's most densely populated cities, could have one of world's largest urban parks.
 ''Yongsan is 80 percent the size of New York's Central Park,'' Lee Myung Bak, Seoul's mayor, said, barely suppressing his jubilation in an interview at City Hall. Central Park is 843 acres. ''If the U.S. troops are relocated by 2007, it would be the first time in 125 years that the Yongsan site is returned to the people of Korea.'' 
 But President Roh Moo Hyun, who survived impeachment to win back full presidential powers on May 14, has described Yongsan as ''a symbol of foreign intervention, invasion and dependence.''
 Now, Koreans ask, who will pay for the move? More than a decade ago, South Korea promised to buy land and invest in facilities and services for a new American headquarters, about $3 billion. But the new, liberal-dominated National Assembly that is to open on June 6 is expected to question the cost.
 ''Now things have changed in Korea; we are in a position to renegotiate,'' said Mr. Jeon, the real estate promoter. ''We will not accommodate all the U.S. requests unconditionally. We will probably pay for what we can pay for, and the U.S. side will pay for the rest.''
 Rather than reduce military spending, South Korean defense officials argue, why not raise the money by auctioning off this prime real estate? 
 ''The land must not be sold to developers,'' said Seo Jae Chul, a director of Green Korea, a major environmental group. ''If that happens, it will directly affect the political livelihood of the Roh administration.''
 Already, new uses are nibbling at the park. South Korean officials have agreed in principle to allow the construction of a United States Embassy on one corner and an English school and a German school on other corners.
 Inside Yongsan, some American officers recall that the United States first agreed to leave Yongsan in 1988. The move was delayed because successive South Korean governments never found a suitable site outside Seoul.
 ''I bet my paycheck that while I am in the Army it will never happen,'' said one American officer here. ''Twenty years from now, I will still be reading about it. It is a great political platform for some people. It's a self-licking ice cream cone.''
 But Pentagon planners vow that the move from Seoul will not be stopped. To sweeten the shift, the United States has promised to spend $11 billion over three years to upgrade American forces in South Korea. 
 ''We move this time, or we just leave,'' said Scott Snyder, a Korea specialist who works for The Asia Foundation, a research institute. ''A brigade could be relocated to Iraq, and then not come back.''
 Last fall, South Korean conservatives were startled to hear an American defense secretary suddenly sound as if he were ready to demonstrate for green parks and Korean sovereignty. On a visit here, Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld asked at a news conference, ''If foreign troops were stationed in New York's Central Park, would it be acceptable to Americans?''

HEADLINE: Fox Objects to a Parody of 'Cast Away'

BYLINE: By SHARON WAXMAN; Charlie LeDuff contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 30 

 BODY:
Twentieth Century Fox has sent a cease-and-desist letter to an independent filmmaker who parodied its movie ''Cast Away'' in a comedy titled ''Miss Cast Away,'' which features a 10-minute appearance by Michael Jackson.
 The movie was shot in September 2003, two months before the police raided Mr. Jackson's estate near Santa Barbara, Calif., and arrested him on charges of sexual misconduct with a child.
 The movie's writer and director, Bryan Michael Stoller, a friend of Mr. Jackson, said he believed the studio was trying to quash his film to avoid association with the tainted pop star. 
 ''Michael Jackson is in it, and he's always been a target,'' Mr. Stoller said. ''I guess they feel it will get a lot of exposure because of him. And No. 2, I think they're just bullying the independent filmmaker because they can.''
 A spokeswoman for Fox said the letter seeking to block the film ''speaks for itself'' and had nothing to do with Mr. Jackson.
 In the letter, which demands that Mr. Stoller change the title of his film, a Fox lawyer, Jon Del Barrio, wrote, ''The distinctive and famous 'Cast Away' title has clearly achieved secondary meaning among the public, and as such has attained trademark rights associated with its use.''
 The letter added: ''We hereby demand that you immediately cease and desist from further use of the 'Cast Away' mark or any other name that is confusingly similar to the 'Cast Away' mark.''
 Parodies are common in Hollywood, from ''Loaded Weapon,'' a spoof of ''Lethal Weapon,'' to ''Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,'' a spoof of James Bond, to ''Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood,'' a spoof of movies like ''Boyz N the Hood.'' Mr. Stoller said he had done a copyright search and found that Fox had no trademark on the title.
 There have been many movies with similar titles in the past, including a 2002 Woody Allen short called ''Castaway: A Woody Allen Film,'' and a 1986 United Artists romance called ''Castaway.'' A movie from 1912 is called ''The Castaway,'' and a 1931 Mickey Mouse film is also titled ''The Castaway.''
 Last year Fox News sued the left-wing political satirist Al Franken to stop him from using ''fair and balanced,'' a catchphrase employed by the network, in the title of his book, ''Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right.'' A judge ruled against the news channel, and the book was published as planned.
 Mr. Stoller's $2 million movie, which has many special effects, is a parody of both ''Miss Congeniality,'' starring Sandra Bullock as an undercover F.B.I. agent at a beauty pageant, and ''Cast Away,'' a 2000 film in which Tom Hanks is a FedEx employee who ends up on a deserted island after a plane crash.
 It is about a group of beauty pageant contestants who crash land on an island. Mr. Jackson plays Agent MJ, descending in a beam of light to save the contestants. That appearance parodies a brief cameo by Mr. Jackson in ''Men in Black II,'' in which he played Agent M.
 ''I thought it would be funny to make him agent MJ, an Obi-Wan-Kenobi-type guy who gives them advice,'' Mr. Stoller said.
 Since his arrest and indictment, Mr. Jackson has been virtually unemployable in the entertainment industry. He is free on $3 million bail and awaits trial.
 Mr. Stoller screened the movie for potential distributors in April but has not sent tapes to other possible distributors because of the letter. He said could not afford a lawyer to fight the action by Fox and did not want to change the title because the movie had already received press attention as a result of Mr. Jackson's participation in it.
 In a follow-up letter on May 4, another Fox lawyer, Robert B. Cohen, wrote, ''The alleged parodic nature of your film does not extend to your film's title.'' He added, ''A parody must make comment on the underlying material that it parodies.''
 Mr. Stoller said his movie did exactly that. ''They're playing God,'' he said. ''I can't afford a lawyer right now. I can't get errors and omissions insurance. No distributor will pick it up. They've pretty much killed the movie unless I change the title.''

HEADLINE: A Divisive Issue for Catholics: Bishops, Politicians and Communion

BYLINE: By DANIEL J. WAKIN; Reporting for this article was contributed by Julie Dunn in Denver, Ellen Harris in St. Louis, Mike Levenson in Boston and Geannina Munizaga in Miami.

 BODY:
The Roman Catholic bishops who have recently suggested that Catholic politicians who support access to abortion are not fit to receive the sacrament of communion are few in number. But their words have stirred strong passions among Catholics far and wide, prompting discussions that raise questions about the meaning of being both an American and a Roman Catholic.
 In interviews with two dozen Catholics, plenty of anger streamed toward the church's hierarchy for what was seen as meddling in politics. But there was also a sense of comfort among some that bishops were taking a stand on an issue -- abortion -- that has become so firmly fixed in the American landscape. 
 The effects of the clergy sexual abuse scandal on the current debate were inescapable, with a number of people faulting the bishops for cracking down on politicians while looking away from the sexual assaults of minors by some priests.
 ''I mistrust the bishops so much that I'm kind of cynical,'' said Daniel W. Sexton, 41, a lawyer in Jersey City. He described himself as strongly opposed to abortion and as an orthodox Catholic who attends a traditional Latin Mass. ''We've got enough problems of our own.'' 
 But reflecting the ambivalent feelings of many Catholics, Mr. Sexton said there was a place for both Christian teaching and moral preaching in the public square and, principally, among all Catholics, not just office-seekers. ''You have to articulate what the teaching is,'' he said.
 Catholic politicians, abortion and communion merged into a recent subject of attention in the pews with the Democratic presidential candidacy of Senator John Kerry, a Roman Catholic who believes in the right to abortion. 
 According to a survey by Catholics for a Free Choice, an advocacy group, 4 bishops have said they would deny communion to politicians who support access to abortion; 17 have urged them to avoid taking the sacrament; and 138 said they would not readily impose such a sanction. The bishops who would deny communion are Archbishop Raymond Burke of St. Louis and Bishops Joseph A. Galante of Camden, N.J., Michael Sheridan of Colorado Springs and Fabian Bruskewitz of Lincoln, Neb. The group did not survey all 195 dioceses and archdioceses. Some Catholics have been spurred to action over the pronouncements by the bishops. Ashley Merryman, 36, a lawyer in Culver City, Calif., has a page on her personal Web site called Cast the First Stone on which she asks people to send stones to the four hard-line bishops as a sign of displeasure. 
 After 15 years away from the church, Ms. Merryman said, she recently returned. ''If I was still on the outs wondering whether to go back to the church, and then I saw the sex scandal, and the bishops saying, 'You're not welcome if you vote this way,' I would never have re-entered,'' she said. 
 A businessman in the Colorado Springs diocese, Ric Kethcart of Parker, Colo., said he would retract a $100,000 pledge to build a new church in the diocese unless Bishop Sheridan withdrew his pronouncement that Catholics who vote for politicians who support abortion rights should abstain from communion. The retraction was previously reported in The Denver Post. 
 ''The position that he took is basically an attempt to impose guilt and sin on people who choose to vote for politicians,'' Mr. Kethcart said in a telephone interview. ''It's a direct slap at historic Irish Catholic Democrats in this country.''
 Matthew Guagliardo, 59, of Clovis, Calif., who said he was a liberal Catholic and had missed Mass only twice in 18 years, said that any bishop who condemned politicians or even voters over a position contradicting church teaching was effectively disenfranchising Catholics.
 ''No one, Catholics or otherwise, likes to be dictated to, particularly in a country where we cherish our freedom,'' said Mr. Guagliardo, an unemployed compliance officer for financial services companies.
 For others, a higher law prevails. ''There are rules that are rules, and you can't change them because times change,'' said Sorina Antela, an executive administrative assistant from North Miami, Fla. Even though she believes in abortion rights, she said, she supports the bishops who would deny communion to politicians who feel that way. 
 Ms. Antela, 33, said she attends Mass regularly but does not take communion because her view on abortion violates church teaching. ''I'm just like a million other Catholics,'' she said. ''I'm torn between the two issues.''
 Aaron Talbot, a 38-year-old banker in Denver, showed no such ambivalence. ''I agree with what Bishop Sheridan and the others are doing,'' said Mr. Talbot, who called himself a devout and conservative Catholic. ''These are beliefs and practices that go back for centuries, long before politics came into play. Politics is a Johnny-come-lately.''
 Some of those interviewed said they thought the bishops were diverting energy from persuading Catholics themselves of the church's position on abortion. (Catholic views roughly reflect that of the general population, according to polls.) Others said the bishops should also address Catholic politicians who do not share church disapproval of other matters, like the war in Iraq and the death penalty. 
 ''It is jarring to hear a small minority of bishops single out Democratic politicians for their pro-choice thinking and seemingly not singling out Republican pro-choice Catholics, or pro-death-penalty Catholics of any stripe,'' said Kevin Doyle, who runs New York State's Capital Defender Office and said he considered himself a faithful Catholic. 
 Experts on the church are divided on what political effects the communion pronouncements will have. While some Catholic politicians like Mr. Kerry could possibly benefit by being seen as the victims of censorious bishops, the accusation that they are disloyal to their faith could resonate with some Catholics. Most of those interviewed said the four bishops' hard-line positions would probably not influence their vote.
 Yet for some, the very intrusion of politics into the arena of faith left a bitter taste.
 ''Like everything else, politics seems to take over everything,'' said Maureen McLaughlin, 61, as she left Mass at St. Cecilia's in Boston on a recent Sunday. ''It should not take over the church.''
 But for Michael Weicher, 26, a lawyer who was also at the St. Cecilia's Mass, the bishops were only doing their duty. ''That's not influencing your politics,'' said Mr. Weicher, who came from Chicago to attend his sister's graduation from Boston College. ''That's judging you as a Catholic, which is what they're supposed to do as a bishop.'' 
 Even some of those who agree with the church's teaching on abortion sounded alienated by the debate.
 ''If you're against it, you should be against it,'' Coleman Nilan, 35, a computer programmer who lives in Brooklyn, said of public figures who say they are personally opposed to abortion but accept its legality. ''By the same token, I think some bishops are grandstanding a little bit.''
 A Republican, Mr. Nilan said the timing of the criticism was troubling. ''If you're going to stick to your guns, I have no problem with it,'' he said. ''But be consistent.''

HEADLINE: And for His Next Feat, a Billionaire Sets Sights on Bush

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE

 BODY:
Under the soaring dome of the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in Manhattan, the financier George Soros delivered a blistering attack on President Bush that was interrupted by applause from the graduating students at Columbia University's international affairs school. On finishing the commencement speech two weeks ago, Mr. Soros was greeted with a rousing standing ovation.
 A day later, Mr. Soros's speech was soundly thrashed on the television show of the conservative Bill O'Reilly, where he was variously derided as a ''left-wing loony,'' a ''crusading atheist,'' a ''dogmatic globalist'' and, finally, a ''madman.''
 Such are the polarizing responses elicited by Mr. Soros, who came to the United States with nothing decades ago and built a $7 billion fortune based on market speculation. Now Mr. Soros has emerged as a financial backer of Democrats, becoming a welcome source of money and a lightning rod for criticism. 
 Yet for Mr. Soros, such attacks are nothing new. He has been accused of causing governments to fall and markets to crumble. He is famously known for betting against the Bank of England -- and winning. Years later, he was an invisible hand behind the anti-Communist movement in Eastern Europe and then spent $1 billion to help rebuild former Soviet republics. 
 Now Mr. Soros has turned his considerable energy and fortune to ousting an American president.
 ''I have come to the conclusion,'' said Mr. Soros, in a recent interview from his Manhattan office with its expansive view of Central Park, ''that the greatest contribution I can make to the values that I hold would be to contribute to the defeat of George W. Bush in 2004.''
 From playing no prior role in partisan politics, Mr. Soros has given $15.8 million to anti-Bush groups and has said he will give more if necessary. He has expressed his views in speeches, full-page advertisements, op-ed articles and a new book, ''The Bubble of American Supremacy.'' 
 All that, of course, has made him a target for Republicans and campaign finance reformers who consider him as a shadowy figure trying to have an outsize influence. ''George Soros has purchased the Democratic Party,'' said Christine Iverson, a spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee.
 Mr. Soros says his motive is not power or position, but the decades and $4 billion he has spent to promote civil liberties in former authoritarian regimes. As a child, he survived the Holocaust in his native Hungary by adopting an assumed identity and, later, he slipped away from the Communists. Those experiences shaped his world view, both as a financier betting on uncertainty and as a philanthropist.
 Mr. Soros hardly minces words in his view that the United States is headed in a dangerous direction. 
 ''The government of the most powerful country on earth has fallen into the hands of extremists,'' he said, referring to neoconservatives influential in the administration. ''It didn't take long,'' he added, ''for the Bush administration to get off the rails and produce disastrous results.''
 Mr. Soros's contributions have gone to several leading efforts: $10 million to Americans Coming Together, which wants to raise $75 million for grass-roots efforts; $2.5 million to MoveOn.org, an Internet advocacy group that runs anti-Bush advertisements; and $300,000 to Campaign for America's Future, a union effort. 
 This comes on top of $3 million Mr. Soros is giving to a liberal research group, the Center for American Progress being started by John D. Podesta, a former chief of staff for President Bill Clinton. 
 By political standards, such numbers are big, but not for Mr. Soros.
 Soros Fund Management, of which he is chairman, has $13 billion in assets under management. Most of his $7 billion net worth is held in the $8.3 billion Quantum Endowment fund, which is part of the Soros financial empire. 
 And each year, Mr. Soros, 73, and his network of foundations give away $450 million, putting them in the same league as efforts like the Ford Foundation, the Lilly Endowment and charities run by Bill Gates.
 Starting from scratch, Mr. Soros became a billionaire by watching global economic and political trends and then placing huge bets in securities markets. The $1 billion he won in 1992 by betting against the Bank of England that the pound would fall made him a tabloid fixture in London and earned him the title ''The man who broke the Bank of England.''
 In 1993, Mr. Soros founded his Open Society Institute and a network of smaller foundations, now active in 50 countries, including the United States. Initially, his goal was to promote democratic change, from financing anti-apartheid efforts to easing the transition of former Soviet bloc countries from Communism.
 His money backed the Solidarity movement in communist Poland and Vaclav Havel's former dissidents in the Czech Republic. He even started a university in Budapest. Today, Soros foundations support thousands of projects involving public health, human rights and legal and economic reform. 
 In the United States, Soros foundations spend $90 million a year on such efforts as distributing the ''morning after'' pill to women to prevent unwanted pregnancies, opposing the death penalty, and financing post-Sept. 11 projects protecting the rights of immigrants. 
 Mr. Bush is not the only world leader Mr. Soros has taken on. He was blamed for the ouster last year of the Georgian president, Eduard Shevardnadze, who resigned amid mass protest. Mr. Soros, whose foundation supported democratic change there, denies the charge. Recently, right-wing Ukrainian students pelted Mr. Soros with mayonnaise as he spoke there.
 These experiences, Mr. Soros said, have strengthened his resolve. ''The fact I'm vilified makes me stand up even more,'' he said.
 Mr. Soros's involvement in the anti-Bush movement took form at his Southampton, Long Island, estate last July when he brought together political consultants, donors and Democratic activists and pumped life into Americans Coming Together, also called ACT, a get-out-the-vote effort led by Ellen Malcolm, the former Emily's List president, and Steve Rosenthal, the former political director of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.
 Also at that two-day beachfront meeting were Peter Lewis, the Cleveland philanthropist, who contributed $3 million, and Robert Glaser, the Seattle high-tech entrepreneur, who kicked in $745,000.
 ''He approached it like a business,'' said Mark Steitz, a consultant Mr. Soros hired to advise him and who had worked with Harold Ickes, a former Clinton chief of staff. ''It was like funding a start-up venture.''
 ACT is one of the groups known as 527 committees, after the section of the tax code that created them, that Republicans and many campaign finance advocates have said skirt new campaign laws and raise large sums of soft money. Ironically, Mr. Soros and his foundation had spent some $18 million to support changes in the campaign finance law, even giving money to some groups now attacking him. 
 Mr. Soros steers clear of day-to-day management of ACT and keeps his distance from it and most politicians, partly for lack of time and partly to maintain distance between these groups and the official campaigns.
 For instance, even though he and Senator John Kerry, the presumptive Democratic nominee, used to see each other socially in Sun Valley, where they both have homes, they have not talked recently. 
 MoveOn.Org received money after Mr. Soros met with Wes Boyd, a founder, in what Mr. Boyd anticipated was a ''get acquainted'' meeting. Instead, he walked out with a major contribution -- Mr. Soros and Mr. Lewis pledged $1 for every $2 raised by MoveOn.Org. 
 ''I was caught flat-footed on how willing George Soros was to fund,'' Mr. Boyd said. ''I'll never live it down that I asked for a one-to-two match. I wish now I had said one to one.''

HEADLINE: Gunmen Kill a Leading Pro-Taliban Sunni Cleric in Pakistan

BYLINE: By SALMAN MASOOD

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, May 30 

 BODY:
Unidentified gunmen killed a leading pro-Taliban Sunni cleric on Sunday morning in the southern port city of Karachi. Enraged protesters then took to the streets and clashed with the police, according to police officials and news reports. 
 The cleric, Mufti Nizammudin Shamzai, had worked to bring together Pakistan's warring Islamic sects and was considered one of the country's most powerful Sunni voices. 
 It was the second high-profile killing of a Sunni cleric in recent months. Last fall, Maulana Azam Tariq, a leading militant, was gunned down on the outskirts of Islamabad. Shiite militants are believed to have carried out that attack. 
 Violence between Shiite and Sunni Muslims has killed more than 1,200 people in Pakistan during the past 15 years. Sunnis make up 77 percent of the country's population of 150 million. Shiites make up 20 percent. 
 The southern port city of Karachi, the largest city in the country, with a population of 14 million and the hub of economic and commercial activity, has recently been hard hit by this conflict. On May 7, 22 people were killed when a suicide bomber attacked a Shiite mosque. A police officer was killed and 26 people were wounded on May 26, when two car bombs went off outside a school in Karachi, near the residence of the American Consul General.
 President Pervez Musharraf condemned the Sunday attack as an act of terrorism, and religious scholars from all major groups condemned it as an attempt to create chaos.
 Mr. Shamzai was killed as he left his apartment along with his son, a nephew and bodyguards, the police said. Three assailants with Kalashnikov rifles opened fire on his double-cabin pickup truck. Mr. Shamzai was pronounced dead at a hospital while his son and driver had minor injuries, police officials said. At least one suspect is believed to have been wounded by the bodyguards, but the assailants escaped.
 A soft-spoken religious scholar in his late 70's with a flowing white beard, Mr. Shamzai was in charge of the Binori Complex in Karachi. The complex, established almost five decades ago and spread over more than six acres, houses a huge religious school for more than 2,000 students. More than a dozen branches in the city accommodate another 9,000 pupils, local news reports said.
 Mr. Shamzai was an ardent supporter of the Taliban, the former rulers of Afghanistan, and many top Taliban commanders attended his schools. In 2001, he led a delegation of Pakistani clerics to Afghanistan in a failed effort to save Taliban forces from attack by the United States.
 His school's best known graduate is Maulana Masood Azhar, leader of the banned militant outfit Jaish-e-Muhammad, or Army of Muhammad, a violent organization now thought to be behind the attempts to assassinate President Musharraf last year. The Pakistani authorities are on a nationwide hunt for Amjad Hussein Farooqi, a member of Jaish-e-Muhammad who is believed to be the operational mastermind behind the two assassination attempts.
 The news of the assassination of Mr. Shamzai enraged his thousands of supporters, mostly students at his schools, who clashed with the police. Dozens of rioters were injured as the police used tear gas and batons in response.
 A mob attacked a police station and set almost three dozen cars on fire, according to initial news reports. They also attacked a gas station and two bank branches. 
 There were also reports on a privately owned television channel that protesters had exchanged gunfire with the police. At least three policemen and four protesters were wounded in gunfire exchanges, the police said.

HEADLINE: Venezuela Opposition Completes Signature-Gathering Effort

BYLINE: By JUAN FORERO; Brian Ellsworth contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, May 30 

 BODY:
Amid rising rancor between President Hugo Chavez and his foes, Venezuelans completed Sunday a three-day campaign to collect enough signatures to force a referendum to end the leftist leader's tumultuous presidency.
 The recall effort is considered the opposition's last-ditch chance to remove Mr. Chavez from office before the 2006 presidential election.
 Although the opposition thought it already had the necessary 2.4 million signatures needed for the referendum, election authorities ruled in March that hundreds of thousands of signatures were flawed. After negotiations with foreign mediators and opposition leaders, election authorities convened a ''repair period,'' during which 1.2 million people who signed in December could confirm their signatures. 
 It was unclear how many signatures were repaired between Friday and Sunday evening, but the opposition needed 530,000 to reach the 2.4 million threshold. If that requirement is met, a referendum could be held Aug. 8, followed by an election to choose a new president.
 ''We want a referendum as soon as possible,'' said Fernando Rubio, 46, an accountant, moments after visiting one of Venezuela's 2,600 polling sites. ''The loss of jobs and the unemployment are hurting the quality of life. We have to get him out of here.''
 Mr. Chavez pledged to accept a referendum, if it were sanctioned by election authorities, after meeting Sunday afternoon with former President Jimmy Carter, whose Atlanta-based Carter Center has mediated here.
 ''If we go to a referendum, let's do it,'' Mr. Chavez, surrounded by aides and bodyguards, said in front of the presidential palace. Smiling before a throng of reporters, he added: ''If they win, I'll leave. I'll leave.''
 But the opposition believes that the electoral council, which is considered partial to the government, will hold up the validation process. If so, the president's adversaries may run out of time to stage a recall to cut short Mr. Chavez's five-and-a-half-year-old government.
 According to Venezuelan law, a referendum held after Aug. 19 would only remove the president -- there would be no election. Instead, Mr. Chavez's vice president, Jose Vicente Rangel, would take over, effectively giving Mr. Chavez the chance to rule from behind the scenes and then run again in 2006.
 For the opposition, the possibility of failing in this latest attempt to oust Mr. Chavez is seen as disastrous for Venezuela's brittle democracy.
 Mr. Chavez, first elected in 1998 and then re-elected in 2000 for a six-year term, has consolidated his hold over key institutions like the attorney general's office, the controller's office and the government's human rights ombudsman. More importantly, Mr. Chavez and his supporters are now on the verge of taking a tighter rein on the 20-member Supreme Court, which may rule on the validity of the signature gathering.
 Under a new law, the National Assembly can add 12 justices and needs only a simple majority to do so, whereas in the past it needed a two-thirds vote. Chavez loyalists are a majority in the Assembly, a situation that will enable Mr. Chavez to more easily appoint and dismiss justices.
 The government also announced recently that it would start training civilians to gather information on antigovernment activities, a plan similar to neighborhood block groups in Cuba, Venezuela's closest ally.
 ''We've seen an acceleration of the plan to dismantle what remains of the democratic state in Venezuela and substitute democratic institutions with neo-authoritarian institutions,'' said Jesus Torrealba, an opposition leader in the Democratic Coordinator, an umbrella of opposition groups.
 The Chavez government, though, considers itself the most democratic Venezuela has had, replacing governments steeped in corruption and nepotism. It views the opposition as unqualified to harp on democratic ideals, since many of its leaders were at the forefront of a coup that briefly toppled Mr. Chavez in 2002.
 The government has charged that the opposition continues to plot Mr. Chavez's overthrow, going so far as to hire a Colombian militia as part of a violent plan to remove him. Some United Nations diplomats privately contend that a radical wing of the opposition did intend to carry out the plot, though details remain sketchy three weeks after Venezuelan authorities arrested dozens of participants and several dissident military officers.
 In an oil-rich country where poverty is widespread, Mr. Chavez has pledged to give voice and attention to the masses.
 With Venezuela now flush with oil money, thanks to world oil prices hovering around $40 a barrel, the government has been spending furiously on education, health care and other social programs. 
 The assistance has helped give the government a 40 percent approval rating, respectable in Latin America. One poll in April even showed that Mr. Chavez would squeak to victory in a referendum.
 ''He's the only president who has ever accepted us with open arms,'' said Rosa Rodriguez, 48, as she shopped in a government-subsidized market. ''He's the only one who comes to our neighborhoods. The people are with Chavez. There won't be a referendum.''
 The president's adversaries, though, accuse the government and its allies of intimidating prospective petition signers. Some public sector employees say they have been pressured to withdraw their signatures, faced with the loss of their jobs or denial of services.
 Concerns about government intimidation tactics prompted Roger Noriega, the United States assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs, to assert recently that the opposition had collected enough signatures the first time around and that Venezuela could be ousted from the Organization of American States if the government blocked a referendum. 
 That has prompted Mr. Chavez and his allies in the Assembly to charge that the United States is conspiring with the president's foes to take over the country. ''Imperialism is revealing its face, that same old horrible, horrendous imperialism that crushed this continent,'' Mr. Chavez said.

PERSON: Archibald Cox

HEADLINE: Archibald Cox, Special Watergate Prosecutor, Dies at 92

 BODY:
Archibald Cox, the special Watergate prosecutor who was fired by the Nixon White House in the ''Saturday Night Massacre'' in 1973, died Saturday at his home in Brooksville, Me.
 He was 92 and died of natural causes, said his wife, Phyllis. 
 Mr. Cox took over the Watergate investigation on May 18, 1973, two months before it was revealed that President Richard M. Nixon had secretly taped his conversations and phone calls in the White House. After Mr. Cox subpoenaed eight of those tapes, he was dismissed on Nixon's orders on Oct. 20, 1973. 
 The highest federal position Mr. Cox held was solicitor general, representing the government before the Supreme Court. He was appointed to the position, the third highest in the Department of Justice, by President John F. Kennedy. He had previously served as a speechwriter and adviser to Kennedy in the Senate and in his campaign for the presidency. 
 Mr. Cox's dramatic but relatively brief time as the special Watergate prosecutor came about because of his friendship with a former law student, Elliot L. Richardson. 
 In late April 1973, Nixon announced the forced departure from his administration of four top-level appointees after they were swept up in the Watergate affair.
 The scandals had begun with the June 1972 burglary of the Democratic National Committee's offices in the Watergate office complex at the height of the president's re-election campaign.
 Over the next two years, Congressional and newspaper investigations unmasked the Nixon administration's cover-up of the burglary and the White House's broader efforts to sabotage the Democrats' presidential campaign. Facing the prospect of impeachment, Nixon stepped down on Aug. 8, 1974, becoming the only American president to resign from office.
 Among those forced out in April 1973 was Attorney General Richard G. Kleindienst. Nixon chose Mr. Richardson to succeed Mr. Kleindienst, specifying that ''if he should consider it appropriate, he has the authority to name a special supervising prosecutor'' for matters arising out of the Watergate case.
 Nixon had hoped to avoid having such a prosecutor. But as the price for Mr. Richardson's confirmation, the Democratic-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee insisted that the new attorney general name a special prosecutor.
 As the special prosecutor, Mr. Cox wound up in a confrontation with the White House, where Nixon appointees suspected he was out to get the president.
 Over five months, Mr. Cox built a Watergate prosecution staff of energetic young lawyers. White House officials complained that most were Kennedy Democrats.
 Mr. Cox quickly widened his investigation into a number of areas, including reports of suspicious financial dealings among members and former members of the Nixon administration.
 Ken Gormley, who wrote a biography titled ''Archibald Cox: Conscience of a Nation,'' said Mr. Cox thought constantly about the political and historical weight of his work, and thus tried to float above partisan lines.
 ''He agonized over what each of his moves would do to the presidency,'' Mr. Gormley said in an interview yesterday. ''This was not a man who was out to get anyone, let alone the president.''
 The Saturday Night Massacre resulted from Mr. Cox's efforts to force the White House to turn over the tapes of Oval Office conversations that ultimately proved that there had been a conspiracy to cover up the administration's ties to the Watergate burglary.
 When Nixon resisted surrendering the tapes, Mr. Cox took the matter to the courts, which ruled in his favor. But Nixon would not give in, and he ordered Mr. Cox to stop pursuing the tapes. Refusing to do so, Mr. Cox said that he was bound by conscience not to capitulate and that he would ask the courts to hold the president in contempt.
 Within a few hours, the ''massacre'' ensued. Nixon ordered Mr. Richardson to dismiss Mr. Cox, but the attorney general refused, saying that as a matter of principle he would not renege on his promise to the Judiciary Committee. Mr. Richardson resigned and the deputy attorney general, William D. Ruckelshaus, was told to fire Mr. Cox. Mr. Ruckelshaus also refused and was himself dismissed. Finally, Mr. Cox was dismissed by Robert H. Bork, the solicitor general. 
 The public outcry was so intense that in the end Nixon was forced to turn over the Oval Office tapes, marking the beginning of the end of his presidency.
 Born on May 17, 1912, in Plainfield, N.J., Archibald Cox Jr. was the son of Archibald and Frances Perkins Cox. His well-to-do father was a patent lawyer who sent him to St. Paul's School in Concord, N.H., from which he graduated in 1930. At Harvard he majored in economics and American history, graduating in 1934. 
 Mr. Cox then entered Harvard Law School and graduated magna cum laude in 1937. He later spent a year as law clerk to Judge Learned Hand of the United States Court of Appeals in New York.
 In 1941, after three years as an associate with a Boston law firm, Mr. Cox joined the staff of the National Defense Mediation Board in Washington. In the next few years he also worked on the staff of the solicitor general and as associate solicitor in the Department of Labor.
 He joined the Harvard Law faculty in 1945 and at various times served as Royall professor of law, the oldest endowed chair at the school; as Williston professor of law; and as Carl M. Loeb university professor. He also taught at Boston University. 
 As a law professor Mr. Cox seemed to make a studied effort to run his life with courtly Yankee good humor. His crew-cut hair, button-down shirts and skinny bow ties were personal trademarks, as was his fondness for driving to work in a pickup truck from his farm in Wayland, Mass. He also had a summer home in Maine.
 A gaunt 6-footer who wore three-piece suits, Mr. Cox was often described as ''ramrod straight,'' not only because of his bearing but also because of his personality.
 In the classroom he had his detractors. He was invariably admired for his scholarship, but his lectures in labor, constitutional and administrative law were at times criticized as soporific and dry.
 ''There's no question that he's in complete command of his subject,'' one student wrote in a critique. ''But he's not a performer in the classroom. There's no sparkle at all.'' 
 In July 1952, President Harry S. Truman appointed Mr. Cox to head a new 18-member Wage Stabilization Board, which faced a backlog of 12,000 cases. But after only four months, Mr. Cox angrily resigned after the president overruled a board decision. The board had voted to lower a wage increase, to $1.50 a day from $1.90, that John L. Lewis of the United Mine Workers had negotiated for his coal miners. Mr. Cox returned to Harvard.
 Over the years, Mr. Cox gained a reputation for drafting labor legislation. He wrote an anti-injunction bill for labor in Massachusetts in 1950, and he helped arbitrate disputes in the machine-tool and textile industries in New England, as well as nationwide disputes in the railroad industry.
 After serving as solicitor general, Mr. Cox returned to Harvard in 1966, just as student unrest was beginning there and on campuses around the nation. At Harvard he played a major role in negotiating with student dissidents and antiwar demonstrators. In 1968 he was named chairman of a five-member committee to inquire into disturbances at Columbia University. 
 After his dismissal as the Watergate prosecutor in 1973, Mr. Cox returned to Harvard, where he taught constitutional law. 
 Mr. Cox, who became a professor emeritus at Harvard in 1984, was the author of several books, including ''Law and the National Labor Policy'' (1960); ''Civil Rights, the Constitution and the Courts'' (1967); ''Freedom of Expression'' (1981); and ''The Court and the Constitution'' (1987).
 In addition to his wife, whom he married in 1937, Mr. Cox is survived by three children, Sarah, of Brooksville, Me., Archibald Jr., of Markleville, Ind., and Phyllis, of Denver; and by several grandchildren and great-grandchildren. 
 Philip Heymann, a fellow law professor at Harvard who worked under Mr. Cox in the Watergate prosecution and was a close associate for more than 40 years, said in an interview that the legacy of Watergate had made Mr. Cox into a revered figure among lawyers, scholars and even, for a time, the general public. 
 ''He was idolized,'' Mr. Heymann said. ''I would be on an airplane with him and the attendant would walk up and ask to seat him in the first-class section.''
 ''It was just a fact of life for him,'' Mr. Heymann said, ''and he didn't let it go to his head.''
