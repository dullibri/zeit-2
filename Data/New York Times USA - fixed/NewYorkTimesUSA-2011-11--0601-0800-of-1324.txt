HEADLINE: A New Era of Gunboat Diplomacy

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER. 
A White House correspondent for The New York Times.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
IT may seem strange in an era of cyberwarfare and drone attacks, but the newest front in the rivalry between the United States and China is a tropical sea, where the drive to tap rich offshore oil and gas reserves has set off a conflict akin to the gunboat diplomacy of the 19th century.
The Obama administration first waded into the treacherous waters of the South China Sea last year when Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton declared, at a tense meeting of Asian countries in Hanoi, that the United States would join Vietnam, the Philippines and other countries in resisting Beijing's efforts to dominate the sea. China, predictably, was enraged by what it viewed as American meddling.
For all its echoes of the 1800s, not to mention the cold war, the showdown in the South China Sea augurs a new type of maritime conflict -- one that is playing out from the Mediterranean Sea to the Arctic Ocean, where fuel-hungry economic powers, newly accessible undersea energy riches and even changes in the earth's climate are conspiring to create a 21st-century contest for the seas. 
China is not alone in its maritime ambitions. Turkey has clashed with Cyprus and stoked tensions with Greece and Israel over natural-gas fields that lie under the eastern Mediterranean. Several powers, including Russia, Canada and the United States, are eagerly circling the Arctic, where melting polar ice is opening up new shipping routes and the tantalizing possibility of vast oil and gas deposits beneath.
''This hunt for resources is going to consume large bodies of water around the world for at least the next couple of decades,'' Mrs. Clinton said in a recent interview, describing a global competition that sounds like a watery Great Game.
Such tensions are sure to shadow President Obama this week, as he meets with leaders from China and other Asian countries in Honolulu and on the Indonesian island of Bali. Administration officials said they expected all sides to tamp down disagreements, though that won't mask the coming conflicts.
''Underlying all of this is the recognition that an increasing share of oil resources is offshore,'' said Daniel Yergin, an energy expert and author of a new book, ''The Quest: Energy, Security, and the Remaking of the Modern World.'' ''When you have energy resources on land,'' he said, ''you know where things stand. When they're offshore, things can get murkier.''
Twenty-nine million barrels of oil a day, one-third of global production, now come from offshore fields, Mr. Yergin said, a share that will rise steadily. The South China Sea alone is estimated to have 61 billion barrels of petroleum -- oil and gas -- plus 54 billion yet to be discovered, while the Arctic is projected to have 238 billion barrels, with possibly twice that in undiscovered sources.
As countries race to erect drilling rigs and send oil exploration vessels to comb the seabed, conflicting maritime claims are helping to fuel a naval arms race. It is no coincidence that the countries with the fastest-growing navies are those with stakes in these energy zones.
China expanded from 2 Soviet-era destroyers in 1990 to 13 modern destroyers in 2010, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London. In its drive for a blue-water navy, one that operates in the deep waters of open oceans, it is also building an aircraft carrier. Malaysia and Vietnam are beefing up their navies with frigates and submarines. India, which wants to make sure it has access to the Far East, is bulking up. And the Israeli Navy is pushing for more vessels to counter Turkish warships circling Israeli drilling rigs.
''Countries want to make sure they have the ability to develop resources and to make sure their trading routes are protected,'' said David L. Goldwyn, a former special envoy for international energy affairs at the State Department.
This competition is also behind calls for the United States to bolster its naval strength, even at a time of budget cuts. Mitt Romney, considered by many the Republican front-runner in the presidential race, declared recently he would ''reverse the hollowing of our Navy and announce an initiative to increase the shipbuilding rate from 9 per year to 15.'' With anemic building rates and tighter maintenance budgets, analysts say, the Navy has been forced to cope with an aging fleet that some say is not up to its challenges.
Even so, the Obama administration has been an active practitioner of gunboat diplomacy, a term that refers to achieving foreign-policy objectives through vivid displays of naval might. Last fall, Mr. Obama sent the aircraft carrier George Washington to the Yellow Sea for joint exercises with South Korea, sending a message to both North Korea and its key backer, China. The move echoed the Clinton administration's decision in 1996 to send the Seventh Fleet to warn China against attacking Taiwan.
The United States has used gunboat diplomacy in Asia at least since 1853, when Commodore Matthew C. Perry sailed his fleet into Tokyo Bay, intimidating Japan into opening up to foreign trade. But these days, the Chinese are fashioning an Asian version of the Monroe Doctrine to press their imperial ambitions.
FOR Mr. Obama, whose roots in Hawaii and Indonesia have imbued him with a strong Pacific worldview, the drawdown in Iraq and Afghanistan gives him a good pretext to turn his gaze eastward. The United States has worked to shore up its ties to old Asian allies, like Japan and South Korea, as well as new giants like India. The goal, though administration officials are loath to say it publicly, is to assemble a coalition to counterbalance China's growing power.
On a recent tour of Asia, Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta pledged not to retreat from the region. ''If anything,'' he said, ''we're going to strengthen our presence in the Pacific.'' This week, Mr. Obama is expected to announce an agreement with Australia for a permanent American military presence there.
On land, the race for energy supplies is not new, of course. From the 1950s to the 1970s, the United States maneuvered to keep Russia out of oil-rich Iran. Today, China is busy cutting deals in energy-rich Africa. But technology has changed the equation, putting undersea oil and gas fields into play as never before.
''At root, it's a question of when and how you will have these conflicts,'' said James B. Steinberg, a former deputy secretary of state with experience in all three regions. ''Will countries see these as win-win opportunities, or will they see them as zero-sum competitions?''
For China, the South China Sea has long been crucial as a supply route for oil and other raw materials to fuel its economy. China's claims have deep historical roots, dating from the 1940s, when Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists drew a dotted line in the shape of a cow's tongue extending south of China, embracing most the sea and two disputed island chains, the Paracels and the Spratlys.
Quarrels over these hunks of volcanic rock wouldn't matter much, except that China, Vietnam and the Philippines are running into one another in the race for oil. Last spring, in two separate incidents, Vietnam accused Chinese vessels of deliberately cutting the seismic survey cables of an oil exploration ship. A former American official said his nightmare scenario would be a Chinese warship's firing on an Exxon oil-drilling ship.
If the South China Sea is simmering, then the eastern Mediterranean is seething. There, claims to huge natural-gas reserves off the coast of Cyprus and Lebanon have raised tensions with Turkey, which occupies half of Cyprus, as well as with Israel. Cyprus and Israel are drilling for gas, angering Turkey. The militant Islamic group Hezbollah, in Lebanon, has threatened to attack Israeli gas rigs.
Further complicating this is the bitter rift between Turkey and Israel after the deadly Israeli commando interception of a Turkish flotilla trying to transport aid to Palestinians in Gaza last year.
''The Turks are saying, 'The Israelis humiliated us; what can we do in return?''' said Charles K. Ebinger, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. ''Part of it is just the greater assertiveness of Turkey's foreign policy everywhere.''
Perhaps the least dangerous arena of competition lies in the frigid north, partly because experts believe that many of the Arctic's mineral deposits lie within one or another of the 200-mile exclusive economic zones of the countries that ring the ocean. But even countries with no Arctic coastline, like China and South Korea, are sending icebreakers there to explore weather patterns and fish migration.
Ironically, the biggest bone of contention there is between two stalwart allies, the United States and Canada. Melting ice has opened up the fabled Northwest Passage, which runs through an archipelago of islands in northern Canada. The United States views the passage as an international waterway, giving American ships unlimited access. The Canadian government insists it is an inland waterway, meaning that foreign ships can use it only with Ottawa's approval.
Canada and the United States are highly unlikely to go to war, of course, though the wrangling could keep maritime lawyers busy for years. As temperatures climb, officials warn, tempers may follow. ''It's a serious legal dispute,'' Mr. Steinberg said. ''When it is ice-free, there will be some real issues.''

HEADLINE: It's Not just About the Millionaires

BYLINE: By ADAM DAVIDSON. 
Adam Davidson is the co-founder of NPR's ''Planet Money,'' a podcast and blog.

 BODY:
This election is about stark differences on economic policy, but one of the few fiscal issues on which Democrats and Republicans agree -- surprisingly -- is how to tax corporations. Every Republican presidential candidate, and even the guy who currently has the job they're after, wants to lower rates. Raising them, or even maintaining them, might satisfy the anti-corporate angst of protesters and populists, but it won't come anywhere near paying off our debt.
Most people who study the issue agree that the top federal corporate tax rate (35 percent of profits) is simply too high. The cardinal rule of taxation is that whatever you put a levy on, you'll inevitably get less of. Taxing corporate activity means less investing, less hiring, fewer jobs and a smaller economy, which hurts the rich, the poor and the middle class alike. While this may seem like Republican propaganda, NPR's ''Planet Money,'' for which I work, polled many leading progressive policy groups and academics, all of whom told us that they would support lowering the top corporate tax rate. In his 2011 State of the Union address, President Obama agreed. Republican candidates are even talking specifics: Mitt Romney proposes dropping it to 25 percent; Rick Perry wants to lower it to 20 percent; Herman Cain, of course, is pushing 9 percent. 
If everyone agrees that corporate taxes should be lowered, why isn't there a deal? One reason is that many corporations, despite claims to the contrary, don't mind a complex tax code with a high statutory rate -- often because few large companies pay anything close to 35 percent. Multinationals avoid taxes by moving profits around their global subsidiaries. U.S.-based businesses hire huge teams of lawyers to navigate motley tax laws and widen every loophole. All politicians advocate eliminating these loopholes until it's their constituents that benefit -- in which case the loophole is renamed an ''incentive.'' Republicans and Democrats in Iowa will punch you in the nose if you question ethanol tax credits. Most people who run for office in Texas and Louisiana like all the sweet tax deals for oil extractors.
Any serious analyst who isn't paid by one of the tax-benefiting industries would suggest eliminating most industry-specific loopholes. But the problem is that cutting them will not even come close to reviving our economy. Alternatively, even if we eliminated all corporate taxes, the extra $250 billion per year at the companies' disposal wouldn't be enough to make our $14 trillion economy grow. President Obama tried an $800 billion stimulus, and we're still debating whether it helped or hurt or did nothing at all.
Businesses are easy targets, but taxing them -- or not taxing them -- isn't the answer. If you can ignore the politics and look at our country's fiscal picture as a math problem, the situation is fairly grim, but it's also fairly clear. Unless we make serious changes, we are going to be in far more debt than we can afford. There have been two important bipartisan commissions -- Rivlin-Domenici and Simpson-Bowles -- that reached the same conclusion: we need to make some significant cuts in Social Security, Medicare and defense and, at the same time, pay a lot more in taxes. The total cost could be around $400 billion more a year.
Corporations aren't going to be able to pay that much. And as much as some people might want to punish them, or at least the C.E.O.'s that run them, it would wreck our economy if we did. It's tempting to look to our millionaires and demand they pay more in taxes, but the same inconvenient truth applies. When you add up all the money made by all the people who earn more than $1 million a year, it amounts to around $700 billion. But since the millionaires already pay close to $200 billion in taxes, the government would have to increase rates to nearly 100 percent -- which is about the worst idea ever -- for it to have any real impact.
It serves the interest of both parties to argue about taxes on corporations and the wealthy because neither wants to discuss the alternative, which is where things get touchy. To solve our debt problems, we have to go to where the money is -- the middle class. People who earn between $30,000 and $200,000 a year make a total of around $5 trillion and pay less than 10 percent of that in taxes (owing mostly to tax incentives and the fact that most families make less than $68,000, where larger tax rates begin). Increasing the middle-class tax burden an additional 8 percent, however, would actually have a bigger impact than taxing millionaires at 100 percent. Still, many experts say we don't need to raise the tax rate on the middle class; we just need to get rid of some of those despised loopholes (or beloved incentives). Most reform proposals suggest gradually eliminating the most popular tax deductions, like mortgage interest rates ($120 billion per year) and workplace health insurance ($200 billion per year). Regardless, most economists acknowledge, and most politicians privately concede, that the middle class will have to give up some benefits (Social Security, Medicare) or it will have to pay more in taxes. Actually, it will probably have to do both. The millionaires will be paying more, too. Leading Democrats are proposing a nearly 10 percent hike.
It's a tough but manageable financial math problem. And America's middle class is actually a lot luckier than its counterparts in Greece, Spain or Ireland, who will be paying higher taxes while their countries' economies shrink, or stagnate. Even the Fed's dark forecasts anticipate that the U.S. economy will return to healthy growth (about 3 percent annually) within a couple of years. Unless we hold on to the fantasy that the solutions to our problems lie in the bank accounts of rich people and corporations.
Topics covered this week:
1. Lowering corporate taxes won't fix the economy.
2. Neither will eliminating loopholes.
3. Hammering millionaires sounds good, but it won't do enough.
4. Look out, 99 percenters.

HEADLINE: Crossing Over, No Translation Needed

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

 BODY:
FOR the last decade Anthony Santos, the lead singer of the bachata group Aventura, has been something of a secret hidden in plain sight. Though Aventura regularly fills Madison Square Garden and other arenas around the country and sells millions of records, Mr. Santos, known to his Latino fans as Romeo, has remained pretty much anonymous outside the Spanish-speaking world.
Now that may be about to change. On Tuesday Mr. Santos, 30, released his first solo CD, ''Formula Vol. 1,'' which features collaborations with Usher and Lil Wayne as well as cameos by Spanish-speaking artists like the flamenco guitarist Tomatito and the rapper La Mala Rodriguez. In addition he is about to shoot a sitcom pilot for ABC, to be set in Washington Heights, about a young Dominican-American and his complicated relationship with his old-fashioned immigrant father. 
''What can I do that I have not already done in Aventura?'' was the thought that Mr. Santos said ran through his mind when the group decided to take a hiatus and do solo projects. ''I've always wanted to experiment singing in other genres and explore. But at the same time I want to make sure that people didn't feel like I've sold out and I'm not going to be a bachatero no more. So I've kept a balance.''
Bachata is a string- and percussion-based style of danceable music born in the slums and the sugar-cane fields of the Dominican Republic and brought to the United States by Dominican immigrants. Aventura, all but one of whose members was born in New York, has modernized the genre by singing in a mixture of Spanish and English and by putting the voice of Mr. Santos -- a high, caressing tenor verging on falsetto and much influenced by R&B crooners -- front and center.
Although most of Aventura's recordings were made independent of major labels and big-name producers (the group's first major hit album, from 2002, was called ''We Broke the Rules''), Mr. Santos's CD is being issued by Sony. That company guided Latin music artists like Marc Anthony, Gloria Estefan, Ricky Martin and Shakira to crossover success in the English-speaking market.
But all of them did so with albums recorded in English. Mr. Santos has insisted that most of the songs on what he sees as his breakout project be sung in Spanish or Spanglish, the mixture of Spanish and English that seems to be his preferred conversational mode.
''Our company has a great history with those artists who marked that first wave,'' said Ruben Leyva, the president of Sony Music, U.S. Latin. ''Romeo defines the next wave. He's doing it on his own terms, and I do think that demographics have a lot to do with that. We're living in a different world than 10 years ago. Hispanics are part of the cultural mix, and that allows him to reach a much greater swath of the public singing in Spanish.'' According to the 2010 census the Hispanic population of the United States is now more than 50 million, making Latinos the nation's largest minority group. Of those 18 or under, a core audience for Mr. Santos, more than 90 percent were born in this country, and many of them are bilingual and bicultural. That also makes a very attractive market for hip-hop, R&B and pop artists, some of whom seem to be as interested as Mr. Santos in crossing over. ''We're making history,'' Usher said in a ''making of'' video that accompanies ''Promise,'' a track in which he sings bachata with Mr. Santos to the rippling accompaniment of a requinto, the small guitar that is the instrumental backbone of the genre.
George Noriega is a Cuban-American songwriter and producer who has worked with Jennifer Lopez, Ms. Estefan, Mr. Martin and Shakira and won a Grammy award. Mr. Santos brought him in to work on ''Promise.,''
''Hearing Usher come in on a bachata, that's something cool and fresh,'' Mr. Noriega said. ''You know that when this hits American radio, it's giving you a flavor you haven't felt before, and it's going to perk up some ears, especially because Romeo has such an original-sounding voice. He's like Barry Gibb, you know when it's him.'' Mr. Santos's voice is indeed an anomaly, and the key to his success. He is tall and muscular, like the basketball player he once aspired to be, and his speaking voice is raspy. But when he sings his songs of love gone wrong, the sound that emerges is sweet, high pitched and soulful, similar to Luther Vandross or Smokey Robinson.
''I was looking at the video for 'Promise,' and there he is so totally vulnerable to the woman,'' said Deborah Pacini Hernandez, author of ''Oye Como Va! Hybridity and Identity in Latino Popular Music'' and a professor of anthropology and American Studies at Tufts University. ''He's cute, and he has that voice, that pleading, breathy vulnerability that has to be so tremendously appealing to women. Bachata is not hip-hop or reggaeton, it's a music that is about men's softer, emotional side and yet is still a dance music.''
It is too early to tell how ''Formula'' will do commercially, but the first single, ''You,'' spent seven weeks at the top of the Latin charts this summer, and ''Promise,'' released last month, has also hit No. 1, with the video having already been viewed more than four million times on Vevo.
''I never liked the term crossover, or at least the definition that everyone has, that you record an album in English, and that's a crossover,'' Mr. Santos said. ''I just felt like that if I'm going to cross over, why not have the English audience cross over too, to my world?''
Asked if the mainstream English-speaking music fans were ready to take that leap, he said he didn't know. ''But I know I'm ready for them,'' he said. ''Look, you've got to take risks, and that's what we did in Aventura.''
Mr. Santos then slipped into Spanish to recite an old proverb: ''De los cobardes, no se ha escrito nada,'' or ''Nothing has ever been written about cowards.'' As he views it, the blending of styles of music is natural for someone of his generation and background.
''I was born and raised in the Bronx, and one of the great things growing up there is that I was exposed to many different genres,'' he said. ''You would go down the block, and on one corner you would hear bachata, on another corner some salsa, and of course there was hip-hop and R&B all over the place. So for me it is very organic to have these combinations, to be speaking in Spanglish.''
Mr. Santos's first experience performing music came in a church choir, which he and a cousin, Henry Santos Jeter, joined not so much out of interest in religion or singing as, he now admits, ''to get chicks.'' At Morris High School in the mid-1990s they were introduced to the brothers Lenny and Max Santos, who led a band that was trying to mix bachata and rock, and the foursome soon became Aventura.
Initially Mr. Santos told his mother, who was born in Puerto Rico, and father, born in the Dominican Republic, that he was merely managing a band, since neither wanted their son to pursue the uncertain career of an entertainer. It's that kind of incident, he said, that will provide fodder for the sitcom pilot he is going to be making next year, which does not yet have a title and has not been cast.
Mr. Santos said that when he was approached about doing the pilot, which is being produced by Overbrook Entertainment, Will Smith's company, it baffled him. Overbrook did not respond to interview requests made through its publicist, but Steve Stoute, the hip-hop impresario who is also the author of a new book called ''The Tanning of America: How Hip-Hop Created a Culture That Rewrote the Rules of the New Economy'' and an executive producer of the pilot, suggested that Mr. Santos had the potential to become another Justin Timberlake, also a boy band graduate who has built a career as an actor.
''A couple of years ago, when Lady Gaga was coming up, she got all this attention when she was booked into Radio City Music Hall for four nights,'' Mr. Stoute said. ''But right at that same time Romeo and Aventura were playing Madison Square Garden for four nights, and they were selling it out. So I said to myself: Who is this guy, and why isn't he commanding more attention?''
ABC seems to be thinking that Mr. Santos can help fill a void in its programming. With ''Ugly Betty'' now off the air after four seasons and ''Desperate Housewives'' with Eva Longoria, also on ABC, about to finish its eight-season run, the number of Hispanic characters on network television can almost be counted on the fingers of one hand, with the one played by Sofia Vergara on ''Modern Family,'' still another ABC sitcom, being perhaps the most prominent.
Mr. Santos goes into the project with the disadvantage of never having acted, at least formally. But he is going to be taking lessons, and he argues that his experience performing for large crowds gives him an advantage over a real novice.
''The reason I feel I'm capable of doing this is that I'm nothing like the character I've created onstage, this Romeo character,'' he said. ''I am very much a shy guy, and when I started out, I would be terrified, I wouldn't look at the crowd, I'd literally be looking at the floor. But I've created this character where I'm acting. I see myself on footage and I say 'That's not me.' ''

6. According to reports out last week, next year will witness the end of what?
A. The CD
B. The McRib
C. People making ''there's an app for that'' jokes
D. Cat videos
Answers:
1. (B) This explains why he said, ''The Department of Education, the Department of Commerce and the Department of My God You're a Beautiful Man.''
2. (D) New Yorkers can handle delays, stoppages and other inconveniences but ask them to be patient and they try to disembowel the disembodied voice. Instead, pre-recorded announcements will apologize for inconveniences, as well as for how the subway smells and that most pizza near Times Square is terrible.
3. (B) Science has confirmed that people looking for dates slim down, while people happy in their relationship tend to put on weight. So the next time your wife asks you if she looks fat in that dress, the best response is, ''I sure hope so.''
4. (B) More than 50,000 Detroiters signed a petition demanding that the band be uninvited from playing the halftime show at the Lions' Thanksgiving Day game. Residents fear that instead of crime and corruption, the city will be associated with Nickelback.
5. (D) A key component of ''When It Starts Dripping From the Ceiling'' is the fake puddle of water on the floor. Unfortunately, it looked so real, it fooled the janitor. Museum officials now believe they've found the culprit responsible for sabotaging another recent installation, ''When the toilet overflowed.''

HIGHLIGHT: Monday's top stories. 

 BODY:
A report on Jammu and Kashmir State recommends that the central government "recognize the 'dual' and 'special' status of Jammu and Kashmir; review all laws imposed on the state after 1952 and respect the right of Kashmiris to travel freely across both sides of the Line of Control," India's border with Pakistan, reports The Indian Express. Kashmir's tenuous relationship with Delhi lies at the heart of its political problems, the report says.
Omar Abdullah, Jammu and Kashmir's chief minister, has been trying to make one of those recommendations a reality: partial repeal of the Armed Forces Special Powers Act. He is at loggerheads with the army, which doesn't think the timing of the repeal is appropriate, but has told the military that "no is not an option," writes NDTV. Mr Abdullah is set to make his case to the prime minister today.
India's growth in the quarter that ended in September was its lowest in three years, at under 7.7 percent. A 28.5 percent drop in net profits from a year ago for 1,200 listed companies (excluding banks and oil companies) was caused by increased fuel costs, a depreciating rupee and rising interest rates, according to The Economic Times. India Inc. is pressing the government to "speed up stalled economic reforms, warning that policy paralysis threatened to derail the India growth story," reports The Times of India. The government has been paralyzed by corruption scandals and unable to pass necessary reforms and changes to sustain growth, a growing chorus of executives and analysts say. 
The United States Embassy in Delhi formally apologized on Sunday to former President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam for screening him twice at John F. Kennedy airport in New York in September. Mr. Kalam, who had already been subjected to a private scan because he was not on the list of dignitaries exempt from screening measures, was asked for his jacket and shoes after he boarded the Air India flight, as security personnel said that these had not been examined during the earlier screening, according to The Hindustan Times.
The Tamil Nadu State government is in the final stages of a plan to light 60,000 homes with solar power this year. "The construction of solar-powered homes for the rural poor is likely to commence in the Madurai district of the state in the third week of November," reports The Hindu. Under the plan, beneficiaries will receive 180,000 rupees ($3,800) of which 150,000 rupees will be used to construct the house and the rest to purchase the solar lighting system.

HEADLINE: The Gulf of Morality

BYLINE: THOMAS B. EDSALL


HIGHLIGHT: If the left and the right see their opposites as morally corrupt, the decision to cut the benefits or raise the taxes of the other side become easy - too easy - to justify. 

 BODY:
"There's a gulf as wide as the ocean between the average politically active conservative and the average politically active liberal. We don't just have political differences; we view the world through very different eyes." So wrote John Hawkins, who runs Right Wing News, at the beginning of the year.
He's right. The left thinks so too. George Lakoff of the linguistics department at the University of California at Berkeley argues that "conservatives believe in individual responsibility alone, not social responsibility. They don't think government should help its citizens. That is, they don't think citizens should help each other."
Rush Limbaugh counters that "the left, the Democrats, can do anything - they can employ strategy and policy which is destructive - and be excused for it on the basis that they had good intentions. And, by the way, that's how they skate on virtually every bit of destructive policy, which is every policy they have."
I could go on, but you get the idea. Left and right look at each other with disdain and incredulity: what planet are these people from?
Perhaps the most illuminating examination of these differences in values can be found in the work of Jonathan Haidt of the University of Virginia, and a number of his colleagues, including Ravi Iyer of the University of Southern California.
Using extensive data collected from online surveys, Haidt, Iyer and their colleagues have found that self-identified liberals and conservatives differ by very large statistical margins on questions of policy preference and political allegiance.
The liberal mind-set is defined by favorable responses to a variety of statements touching on economics, war and crime. Liberals agree that it feels wrong "when an employee who needs their job is fired"; "that it's morally wrong that rich children inherit a lot of money while poor children inherit nothing"; and they describe themselves as often having "tender, concerned feelings for people less fortunate than me."
Those on the left also agree that "peace is extremely important." They believe that they have "understanding, appreciation and protection for the welfare of all people and for nature" and they feel "close to people all over the world." Liberals generally "believe that offenders should be provided with counseling to aid in their rehabilitation."
On all of the above statements, conservatives - no surprise - disagree with liberals. They believe that employees who "contribute more to the success of the company" should "receive a larger share" of the pie and they value "social status and prestige, control or dominance over people and resources." The differences of opinion on war and peace are extreme, reflecting the importance of the hawk-dove split between the parties. Many on the right agree with few qualms that "war is sometimes the best way to solve a conflict" and that "there is nothing wrong in getting back at someone who has hurt you."
Conservatives believe "that 'an eye for an eye' is the correct philosophy for punishing offenders," and they endorse the view that "the 'old-fashioned ways' and 'old-fashioned values' still show the best way to live." It feels wrong to them when "a person commits a crime and goes unpunished." From the beginning, "respect for authority is something all children need to learn."
This might all seem obvious, but actually seeing how the world looks to the most representative members of the left and the right helps us understand why the gulf between the sides is so deep. They talk right past each other. Analyzing the hurdles facing Democrats, Haidt attempts to explain to progressives why roughly half the population votes Republican in presidential contests. 
People who call themselves strongly liberal endorse statements related to the 'harm/care' and 'fairness/reciprocity' foundations, and they largely reject statements related to 'in-group/loyalty,' 'authority/respect,' and 'purity/sanctity.' People who call themselves strongly conservative, in contrast, endorse statements related to all five foundations more or less equally. We think of the moral mind as being like an audio equalizer, with five slider switches for different parts of the moral spectrum. Democrats generally use a much smaller part of the spectrum than do Republicans. The resulting music may sound beautiful to other Democrats, but it sounds thin and incomplete to many of the swing voters that left the party in the 1980s, and whom the Democrats must recapture if they want to produce a lasting political realignment. 
Conservatives and liberals speak different languages, so much so that they can hardly hear each other. "We have a moral responsibility to address the problems we face. That means working together to cut spending and rein in government," John Boehner, the Republican Speaker of the House, told the National Religious Broadcasters on Feb. 27. "We have a moral responsibility to deal with this threat to freedom and liberate our economy from the shackles of debt and unrestrained government." 
Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic House Minority Leader, argued from a diametrically opposed position. "This legislation will destroy American jobs while harming middle class families, young adults, seniors, and yes, even our veterans," she said:
Consider what the Republican legislation we debate today would do to diminish our investments in education, halt innovation, destroy good-paying American jobs and make our neighborhoods less secure. Indeed, not even homeless veterans are spared by the Republicans. Our federal budget, as I said, must be a statement of our national values. 
While there are obviously many Americans who fall between the poles represented by Boehner and Pelosi, strong views animate primary voters, the most ideological partisans. Candidates facing primary constituencies - Democrats as well as Republicans - must signal agreement with positions held by their most ideological supporters, moderating as they approach the general election. Republicans will be pushed to embrace compassion just as Democrats will be compelled to advocate national defense and 'personal responsibility.' Whoever makes the better case will pick up the center.
But moral reasoning is inhospitable to "split-the-difference" pragmatism, and never more so than when material benefits are at stake. Electoral politics determine the distribution of valuable resources, and moral commitments can mask otherwise naked resource competition.
Voters on the left and right can now use social-cultural issues as signifiers for their positions on distributional policies. Opposition to abortion or gay marriage is a way to identify office seekers who oppose progressive levels of taxation, just as support for reducing penalties for the possession of crack cocaine or advocacy of a 'low-carbon future' mark a politician who will vote for more generous unemployment compensation and higher wages for women.
The intensification of disagreements over moral values not only makes compromise difficult to achieve, but sharpens competition for scarce goods at a time when austerity dominates the agenda. If, as is increasingly the case, left and right see their opposites as morally corrupt, the decision to cut the benefits or raise the taxes of the other side become easy - too easy - to justify.

HEADLINE: 'Oops' Moment Takes On a Life of Its Own

BYLINE: JOHN HARWOOD


HIGHLIGHT: Questioners did not expect a moment that would ripple across the Internet as one of the biggest debating calamities ever to befall a contender. 

 BODY:
http://www.hulu.com/watch/299649/saturday-night-live-cold-opening-gop-debate-3
ROCHESTER, Mich. - I knew our CNBC presidential debate had broken through when my daughter called from college to shout: "Dad, you're on my two favorite Web sites!"
She was talking about CollegeHumor.com and PerezHilton.com, two among the scores of outlets that replayed my exchange with Gov. Rick Perry of Texas that ended with "Oops." It continued through "Saturday Night Live," with Fred Armisen and Nasim Pedrad playing me and my moderating partner, Maria Bartiromo.
We hardly anticipated slapstick to result from our visit to "Tension City," the PBS anchor Jim Lehrer's term for the experience of moderating presidential debates. Discussions of taxes, deficits and Federal Reserve interest rate policy rarely end that way.
We definitely didn't expect a moment that would ripple across the Internet as one of the biggest debating calamities ever to befall a presidential contender.
But surprise is inherent in these unscripted, high-stakes events. And this one posed especially unpredictable complications.
Start with eight Republican candidates, with varying motivations, depending on their ranking in the 2012 campaign.
Add six questioners from CNBC. Each of us - by virtue of our backgrounds covering politics, business and markets in Washington, New York and Chicago - brought different perspectives.
Then mix in the pressures of live television, and the result was something that no amount of planning could have prepared us for.
As it happened, Maria and I nearly missed the moment that unfolded after Mr. Perry got lost in his stump speech. Only the sharp instincts of a colleague who never appeared on camera ensured that we didn't.
Focus on Economy
Our planning meetings began in earnest two months ago. CNBC producers assembled a thick notebook of economic data and information about the candidates.
Most debate topics were obvious, even if we didn't know how they would translate into questions from us. The entire campaign has revolved around how to generate economic growth, adjust tax and spending levels, and stimulate new hiring.
New topics surfaced as debate night approached. Some, like the deepening European debt crisis, matched our objective of focusing on economic issues.
Others, like the disclosure of sexual harassment accusations against Herman Cain, did not. But the issue had garnered so much attention that it was impossible to avoid.
Soon after the debate began last Wednesday at 8 p.m., we confronted one variable that was completely out of our control: the willingness of the candidates to challenge one another, or not.
When Mr. Perry declined my invitation to critique the leadership of Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, it was clear he wouldn't repeat his aggressive tack from the previous debate. No one else did, either.
Indeed, most of the aggression inside Oakland University's Athletics Center O'rena was directed at us. Audience members booed when we raised the Cain controversy.
We expected that, since Maria and I had received the same reaction at a breakfast of Michigan Republicans that morning. Nor was it surprising when former Speaker Newt Gingrich followed his pattern of attacking debate moderators rather than rival candidates.
What did surprise us was when Mr. Perry's emphatic speech about budget cutting suddenly ran into a synaptic wall.
'Let's See ... '
"It's three agencies of government when I get there that are gone," Mr. Perry declared. "Commerce, Education and the, uh, what's the third one there, let's see ..."
As he scoured his memory, awkwardness drifted into levity. Mr. Perry smiled; I chuckled along with the audience. When Mr. Romney helpfully offered, "E.P.A.?" Mr. Perry repeated it with a joshing wave of his hand.
Since our tasks as moderators included keeping the conversation moving, Maria began asking a new question. But our senior producer, who communicated with us throughout the debate through our earpieces, recognized the moment faster than we did.
"DON'T STOP!" the producer, Sandy Cannold, called out.
So I asked whether the Environmental Protection Agency was in fact the third department on Mr. Perry's list. He acknowledged that it wasn't. When I offered him another chance, Mr. Perry glanced at notes but couldn't find the answer (the Department of Energy).
The rest of the debate flew by. No one doubted the headline - especially not Mr. Perry, who entered the post-debate "spin room" to begin an extended effort to defuse his 53-second gaffe with self-deprecating humor.
Then the grousing came. A woman I dated 30 years ago, whose Facebook profile photo is a snapshot of her with Mr. Cain, sent me a "shame on you" message for raising the harassment accusations.
We had promised the candidates fairness rather than equal time, but those who felt neglected weren't happy. Mr. Santorum, with 5 minutes and 28 seconds of airtime, was on the screen roughly half the time that Mr. Romney was.
Most surprising was the displeasure voiced from a campaign that emerged unscathed. Even as Mr. Perry's misfortune moved Mr. Romney another step closer to the Republican nomination, his aides complained vehemently that my questions were, um ... what's the word?
Oh yeah - unfair.

HEADLINE: Economy In Japan Shows Signs Of Strength

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

 BODY:
TOKYO -- Japan's economy grew at a 6 percent annualized rate in the third quarter, signaling a strong recovery after the devastating tsunami in March. Still, a slowing global economy and a stubbornly strong yen cloud the outlook for Japan, the world's third-largest economy.
Helped by a rebound in exports and consumption, the gross domestic product expanded 1.5 percent in the three months through September, compared with the previous quarter, numbers released by the Cabinet Office showed Monday. The widely expected uptick, equivalent to an annualized rate of 6 percent, was the first expansion in the Japanese economy in four quarters. 
The rebound underscores the speed at which Japanese industry has been able to get back on its feet after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami, rebuilding factories and re-establishing supply chains severed by the destruction.
Exports jumped 6.2 percent as manufacturers got production back on track. Private consumption, which accounts for almost two-thirds of Japan's economy, grew 1 percent, helped by a rebound in consumer sentiment and replacement demand in the tsunami zone.
Still, policy makers and economists also worry that the punishingly strong yen of recent months as well as weak growth in major trading partners, like the United States and China, will take a toll on Japanese exports. The crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, meanwhile, has thrown the country's energy policy into disarray and cast a pall over Japan's recovery.
Because global investors see the yen as a safe haven in times of global economic turmoil, its value has climbed to historic highs in recent weeks amid fears over Europe's debt crisis. A strong yen hurts the competitiveness of Japanese exports and erodes the value of exporters' repatriated earnings.
Government intervention in currency markets to try to weaken the yen has been unable to reverse its rise.
Some economists say the Japanese economy may backtrack in the final quarter of 2011, as exports take a further hit from soft demand worldwide.
Motohisa Furukawa, the economy minister, said after the announcement that he expected Japan's recovery to continue for the time being, and he warned that the global economic backdrop was ''becoming far more severe.''
''We must carefully watch for the downside risks to the Japanese economy,'' he told reporters.
Japan's central bank will begin a two-day policy meeting Tuesday to discuss measures to prop up the country's recovery. Last month, it expanded an asset-purchase program to increase liquidity in the economy.
The government is also spending heavily to support post-tsunami reconstruction. Earlier this month, the lower house of parliament approved a 12 trillion yen ($155 billion) spending package aimed at kick-starting recovery on the ravaged northeast coast of the country, bringing total spending pledged so far to 18 trillion yen ($233 billion).
But Japan is already saddled with public debt more than twice the size of its $5 trillion economy.
Unlike with Italy or Greece, however, investor confidence in Japan's government bonds remains high, allowing the country to continue borrowing at low rates for the time being.
The Japanese economy ''rebounded impressively at the beginning of the summer,'' Masamichi Adachi, an economist for JPMorgan Securities in Tokyo, said in a note. ''Since then, the momentum of the recovery has slowed markedly.''
Mr. Adachi predicted that growth in the fourth quarter would slow sharply to about 2 percent on an annualized basis. He had predicted 5.5 percent growth on an annualized basis for the three months through September.
''Ongoing moderate recovery likely will continue beyond the end of the year, barring a meltdown of the global financial system,'' he said.

Its latest foray into popular culture is in the next Batman movie, ''The Dark Knight Rises.'' But over the weekend, there was a cost to such fame: snarled traffic and befuddled drivers on both sides of the bridge. 
For nearly the entire weekend, the top level of the Ed Koch Queensboro Bridge was closed in both directions to accommodate filming crews; it was not scheduled to reopen until late Sunday.
In a city accustomed to seeing itself on screen -- and conditioned to tolerate the occasional street closings that result -- the arrangement highlighted, on a grander scale than usual, the dual effects of efforts to attract film crews to New York's neighborhoods. The presence of a big-budget movie infuses the city with dollars and jobs, proponents say, but it can also grind its thoroughfares to a virtual halt.
''It was horrendous,'' Mattie Matthews, 67, said of the traffic as she pointed to a row of cars idling on East 58th Street. ''On a Sunday, it would never look like this.''
Another peculiarity of the scene: a fleet of cars with ''Gotham'' license plates taking up parking spaces.
As orange cones and barricades lined entryways to the bridge on Sunday, many drivers trying to get to the top level approached traffic officers, ignoring green lights, to stop and ask for alternate directions. Some made snap decisions as they veered away from the barricades, swerving into the lane for the lower level or turning onto Second Avenue to find another way.
Former Mayor Edward I. Koch, for whom the bridge was named last spring, was not aware of the closing Sunday -- ''the City Council did not require that I be informed,'' he joked -- but said he had championed the city's promotion of film and entertainment since his time in office, when he pushed for the revitalization of the Kaufman Astoria Studios in Queens.
Other mayors have followed suit. In August, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg cited growth in the city's entertainment industry as ''one of the reasons we create jobs at a faster clip than the rest of the nation.'' The entertainment industry, according to the mayor's office, contributes $5 billion to the city's economy each year and supports 100,000 jobs; behind-the-scenes tasks often fall to local businesses.
''Some people will be slightly inconvenienced,'' the mayor said then. ''And the city's job is to find that balance.''
Mitchell Moss, a professor of urban policy and planning at New York University, said the city stood to reap indirect benefits as well. ''It reaches a global market,'' Professor Moss said. ''Every person who sees 'Batman' is going to say, 'Boy I'd like to see New York.' ''
Some residents near the bridge said the short-term nuisance was worth the trouble, noting that the New York City Marathon had been just as disruptive a weekend earlier. Ms. Matthews said she had only one complaint: the film's star, Christian Bale, had not shown his face on the city's sidewalks, to her knowledge. ''He should be walking around shaking hands,'' Ms. Matthews said. ''And kissing older women.''
Mr. Koch, meanwhile, may welcome the film's stop in the city, but he did not care much for its predecessor, ''The Dark Knight.'' In recent years, the former mayor, who has reviewed films for The Huffington Post, has supplied video critiques on the Web site www.mayorkoch.com.
Of ''The Dark Knight,'' he wrote, ''the story is the same old, same old of Batman saving Gotham City'' from a cast of villains. ''Not to worry, no hero or anti-hero is killed off,'' he continued. ''They will be needed for the inevitable sequel.''

To the Editor:
Re ''The Gridlock Where Debts Meet Politics'' (Economic Memo, front page, Nov. 6): 
David Leonhardt says Americans are unwilling to come to terms with the fact that our commitments to public spending outweigh our revenue. He writes that ''there are no simple solutions that would quickly win the approval of citizens'' and sees ''resistance to the higher taxes and reduced benefits necessary to return countries to financial stability.''
In fact, a clear consensus on a solution exists. Solid majorities of Americans want tax increases to be part of deficit-reduction efforts, according to at least 23 polls taken over the past 11 months. This fact has been largely ignored amid the anti-tax sentiment that dominates political discourse.
It is Congressional Republicans in thrall to big-money interests who are blocking the revenue increases that would not only close the deficit but, history suggests, also create badly needed jobs.

HEADLINE: New Austerity Incites a Bitterness the Postwar Generation Did Without

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL

 BODY:
LONDON -- Before he died of Lou Gehrig's disease in 2010, the historian Tony Judt recalled childhood days just after World War II in a debilitated Britain that was slowly ceding its empire and its pre-eminence.
''Clothes were rationed until 1949, cheap and simple 'utility furniture' until 1952, food until 1954,'' he wrote in a memoir, concluding that austerity in ''that bare-bones age'' was ''not just an economic condition: it aspired to a public ethic.'' 
It was not just in Britain.
A continent was reeling, its cities and industries ruined. As Soviet Communism threatened to encroach and the cold war loomed, Western Europe awaited the salvation of America's Marshall Plan. Cars were few and small, vacations modest, belts tight.
As it confronts its massive debt problem, though, and a new austerity threatens to become its default setting, Europe seems to have lost sight of the fact that it has been there before; that the baby boom generation found its roots in postwar hardship; that, as Mr. Judt suggested, the huge affluence of more recent years could barely have been imagined as people struggled to shake off the gloom of war.
The difference now is that the taste for wealth, the aspiration to automatic betterment and the assumption of ever-expanding horizons have become universal, cemented by the growth of the European Union and the adoption of a single currency, the euro, that has spread a leavening of prosperity among the 17 countries in the union that use it.
In Mr. Judt's early days, after the grinding deprivation of a world war, austerity trumped global conflict. Now, the point of departure is prosperity, a fool's paradise in which Europeans came to see affluence as a state of being, a birthright.
As politicians slowly and reluctantly confront the reality that the bounty days are over, what makes the challenge so explosive is not simply a question of economics; it is one of expectations and cultural divides.
In the lands of southern Europe, used to getting by with wile and guile, the prospect of hardship seems all the more bitter, illuminating, as it does, what outsiders cast as an all-too-predictable national failure to live up to the membership rules of the euro club that were devised and watched over by hard-nosed Germany in particular.
Modern austerity could never be described as an ethic; for southern European nations squirming under pressure from the Continent's wealthier northern lands, it is an affront to come to grips with the legacies of economic ill-discipline. And in the north, it is a high price to pay to rescue the profligate south.
Austerity is a time bomb ticking ever louder.
''Now the dominoes will move west,'' Costas Douzinas, a professor of law in London, wrote in The Guardian newspaper after the fall of Prime Minister George A. Papandreou in Greece, depicting the implosion of the Athens government as a result of popular anger that the elites ''are unable to comprehend or contain.''
''The elite's fear of 'contagion' should not be just about the euro,'' he said. ''They should also fear Greek resistance spreading across Europe.''
In a way, that may already be happening
By Tuesday, Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy had also promised to go. He did so on Saturday.
In London, where demonstrators have taken up residence in an encampment outside St. Paul's Cathedral, emulating the occupations that have spread in New York and other American cities, students took to the streets on Wednesday to protest increased college tuition fees; disgruntled electricians and disconsolate cab drivers staged demonstrations of their own.
As the riots in London and elsewhere in August seemed to show, the profound gulf between haves and have-nots has been magnified by the inequalities and envies of a society that has built its newest altars to consumption and greed.
If there is discontent now at the prospect of a modern austerity far less onerous than the hardships evoked by Mr. Judt, then there is also a sense of uneven payback for years of prosperity when, in Britain, well-being exploded on levels of credit and consumption that now seem inconceivable.
Just last week, as the St. Paul's protesters railed against capitalism, the Royal Bank of Scotland -- majority-owned by British taxpayers, who bailed it out after the meltdown of 2008 -- was reported to be planning to set aside $800 million in bonuses for bankers seen by many as authors of the nation's malaise.
Yet the lesson for Europe's elites is not so much that they are threatened by popular dissent. Mr. Papandreou and Mr. Berlusconi both survived anger and denunciation on the cobblestones of their capitals. What brought them down was a global debt market that pushed the cost of borrowing beyond affordable levels: markets made the bad habit of living beyond one's means simply too expensive.
In Greece and Italy, as in Ireland and Portugal before them, unelected bond traders defined the destiny of elected leaders. By week's end, the market jitters had spread to Spain and France.
''If the leaders of the euro zone want to save their currency, then they, together with the institutions of the euro zone, must act now,'' said Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain, which does not use the common currency of its major trading partners but shares their fears of protracted decline. ''The longer the delay, the greater the danger.''
In Mr. Judt's day, austerity guaranteed a minimum level of access to basic supplies, the harbinger of better days; now, austerity is about the removal or diminution of jobs, pensions, comforts and benefits that have accrued since then -- the herald, thus, of much darker times.

HEADLINE: In Paris, Keeping a Watchful Eye on Rome's Troubled Finances

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ and LIZ ALDERMAN

 BODY:
First it was Athens. Then Rome. Could Paris be next?
While Italy has replaced Greece as the focus of anxiety amid Europe's worsening debt crisis, investors are increasingly concerned about the outlook for France, whose banks are among the world's biggest and are closely linked with their counterparts in the United States.
One crucial gauge of investor sentiment, the difference between what France pays to borrow versus what Germany pays, has doubled since the beginning of October, and last week reached its widest point since the formation of the euro currency zone in 1999. Meanwhile, speculation that France could soon lose the sterling triple-A rating on its sovereign debt intensified after Standard & Poor's mistakenly told clients on Thursday that it was downgrading France's debt.
The jump in Italian bond yields to more than 7 percent last week, on concern about Rome's ability to borrow, reminded investors just how much Italian debt French banks hold. 
But French banks also hold a lot of French government bonds, whose yields have risen in tandem with concerns that Paris's finances may be strained as it foots a larger bill to help prevent the crisis from engulfing Italy.
''Once you are dealing with Italy, you are dealing with France as well,'' said Hans Mikkelsen, senior credit strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. ''This is cutting into the core.''
French banks are also more dependent on short-term financing than their rivals elsewhere, leaving them vulnerable if Italy's problems create a Lehman-like freeze in credit markets.
For the moment, the ascent of a new interim government in Rome and the appointment of Mario Monti, a former European commissioner, as prime minister, have calmed those fears. French politicians, regulators and bankers insist that Italy's problems are contained, and will not affect French banks, which have slashed their holdings of Italian sovereign debt in the last few months.
But French banks, and others on the Continent, have traditionally turned to American money-market funds to finance the gap between what they possess in deposits and what they owe, and though French banks have cut this borrowing substantially in recent months, it is still huge. At the end of October, money-market funds in the United States owned $84 billion worth of French debt.
Estimates for total American bank exposure to France vary widely. Direct holdings of French sovereign debt are small but total exposure runs into the hundreds of billions, according to the Bank for International Settlements. A recent Congressional Research Service report estimated that American bank exposure to German and French banks totaled more than $1.2 trillion
The roots of France's exposure to Italy lie in the decision by French banks to expand aggressively over the last decade by acquiring banks there and operating big branch networks. BNP Paribas, which bought Banca Nazionale del Lavoro of Italy five years ago, holds 12.2 billion euros in Italian sovereign debt, despite reducing its Italian bond holdings by 40 percent since the summer and whittling its exposure to Italy to 1 percent of its total commitments.
''We are in a much better position to face any problems than we were three to four months ago,'' said Antoine Sire, the head of communications at BNP Paribas in Paris. A recent stress test by the European Banking Authority showed that BNP did not need to raise more to guard against a worsening of the crisis.
Credit Agricole, another French financial giant, holds 8.7 billion euros worth of Italian bonds. Societe Generale, whose shares have been pounded in recent months on fears of a Greek default, holds 1.5 billion euros in Italian bonds after it also slashed its holdings.
Indeed, among banks on the Continent, French institutions have been the most exposed to Italy, according to a recent report by Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, holding more than $100 billion worth of sovereign Italian bonds and on the line for an additional $300 billion in loans to private borrowers like Italian companies and consumers, though these figures have been dropping in recent weeks.
As a result, imposing a write-down in the value of Italy's debt, a so-called haircut, would have a much more devastating effect on bank capital levels than the 50 percent reduction in the face value of Greek debt agreed to by European leaders last month.
What is more, the amount of money owed by Italy -- just under 2 trillion euros -- dwarfs the 350 billion euro debt load of Greece.
While nobody expects Italy, a much wealthier economy than Greece, to force losses on banks the way Greece did, ''Italy is too big to fail and too big to bail,'' Mr. Mikkelsen said. ''We don't have enough of a cushion in the European banking system to take a meaningful haircut on Italian debt.''
Jean-Pierre Lambert, a senior bank analyst with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in London, added that ''if Italy deteriorates dramatically, some French banks would be engulfed in the contagion and that would require capital support from the state.''
To be sure, anxieties about Italy eased Friday, with yields on its debt falling below 7 percent, and the prospect of a new government there has raised hopes its budget problems will finally be brought under control. On Saturday, Parliament approved austerity measures sought by the European Union, followed by the resignation of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi.
And when it comes to France itself, its economy is much healthier than that of Italy. Unlike Italy, where debt equals 120 percent of gross domestic product, the debt-to-G.D.P. ratio of France stands at a much more manageable 85 percent. The French economy has also grown at about twice the rate of Italy's over the last decade.
French authorities have been keeping a close eye on the rapidly unfolding developments in Italy. But they maintain that French banks have adequate capital to weather the storm, and expect efforts by European leaders, as well a new Italian government committed to fiscal reform, to help keep the crisis from becoming more severe.
Indeed, French officials maintain that Italy will never default.
Despite paltry growth and one of the highest debt loads in the world, Italy is still a much wealthier economy than Greece, Portugal or Ireland, and the government is pushing through austerity measures to accelerate an improvement of its finances.
That does not mean that French officials are not concerned. Behind closed doors, they acknowledge that French banks hold far more in Italian debt than they ever held in Greek government bonds. Christian Noyer, the governor of France's central bank, summed up the thinking of the French establishment, declaring recently that concerns about Italy would ''dissipate once the country has the political means to implement its structural reforms.''
French officials have tried to influence such an outcome. As Italian bonds climbed further last week, President Nicolas Sarkozy and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany privately urged Italy's president, Giorgio Napolitano, to pick the technocrat, Mr. Monti, said a former top-ranking Italian government official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
With Mr. Berlusconi out of the limelight, the Italian Senate on Friday approved a package of austerity measures that Mr. Monti's government is expected to enforce, a move that stoked a rally in financial markets and helped push Italy's bond yields below the 7 percent threshold that had led Greece, Ireland and Portugal to seek financial bailouts.
France considers its big banks sound because they have been forced to hold significant amounts of Tier 1 capital, which protects against losses, and have less leverage than before.
Yet the French government recognizes that the risk of contagion ''is always there,'' and is ready to backstop any of its large banks in the event that conditions deteriorate, said a French regulator who is directly involved in monitoring the national banking system.
''The French government would never let any major banks fail, so of course we have money available'' to backstop them, the regulator said.

GRAPHIC: CHART: Shifting Concerns: Higher bond yields have driven up Italy's borrowing costs to levels considered unsustainable in the long run. But interest rates on French bonds have risen to worrying levels, too. Last week, the spread between French and German bonds was the widest since the euro's introduction. (Source: Bloomberg) (B2)

HEADLINE: Fox's U.F.C. Broadcast Hits an Eight-Year High for Fight Ratings

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR

 BODY:
Fox's hourlong Ultimate Fighting Championship broadcast Saturday night was seen by an average of 5.7 million viewers -- more than for any previous U.F.C. event and the most for a televised fight of any kind in eight years, the network said Sunday. 
The match -- Junior dos Santos's victory over the heavyweight champion Cain Velasquez -- began the seven-year contract between Fox and the U.F.C. that is said to be worth $100 million annually to the U.F.C., the leading mixed martial arts organization.
The viewership of 5.7 million is the most for a televised fight since 7 million watched a Lennox Lewis-Vitali Klitschko boxing match on HBO in 2003.
The dos Santos-Velazquez fight, which began 36 minutes into the 9-to-10-p.m. Eastern broadcast, took only 64 seconds. Fox filled the time with analysis and interviews.
One reason Fox acquired the rights to the U.F.C. on broadcast and cable (FX) was to attract the often elusive demographic of young viewers, especially men 18 to 34. According to Nielsen figures, the U.F.C. broadcast generated a 4.3 rating among men 18 to 34, more than any college football telecast this season (through Nov. 5) except for the Louisiana State-Alabama game on Nov. 5.
N.B.A. ON TWITTER As the N.B.A. labor negotiations continue, the league's commissioner, David Stern, and the deputy commissioner, Adam Silver, went on Twitter on Sunday night and discussed everything from contraction (which has been discussed) to sending players to the Development League at slashed salaries (which is not in the league's proposal).
Among those asking: Miami's Dwyane Wade and Philadelphia's Spencer Hawes. One of Hawes's questions was, ''since we have covered all of your alleged losses(and more) why am I not getting ready for a game tonight.'' The league said it disagreed with the premise.
Wade asked, ''why are all your 'system solutions' only impacting the PLAYERS?? What have the owners (given) up of significance??'' The NBA responded, ''The economics & system favored the players in prior CBA,'' then again said team losses topped $300 million last season.
Someone asked if the league would consider replacement players. The answer: ''Our goal is a season with our current players.'' Another wanted to know if contracts would become void if the union decertified, and the league said yes. (AP)

HEADLINE: Recruiting Veterans, Columbia Finds an Impressive Applicant Pool

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINERIP

 BODY:
CAMP PENDLETON, Calif. -- Two years ago, in an effort to attract more veterans to Columbia, Curtis Rodgers, a dean of admissions, began recruiting at military bases. Almost immediately he noticed differences between the Marines and the typical 18-year-old Ivy League applicant.
Marines are less aggressive. When Mr. Rodgers asked Sgt. Tiffani Watts at the end of a recent interview if she had any questions, the Marine answered, ''I do, sir, but I don't want to make you late for your next interview, sir.''
Marines are open about academic weaknesses. ''To be forthright, sir, I did very poorly in high school,'' Cpl. Leland Dawson began his interview. ''It was a bit shaky, sir.''
Marines are understated. While 18-year-olds describe in detail a week they spent in Costa Rica building houses for the needy, Sergeant Watts, Cpl. Benjamin Vickery, Cpl. Tyler Fritz and Cpl. Andrew King barely mentioned their deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. ''No one wants to brag about something so terrible,'' Corporal King said. ''In a brief 30 minutes you can't explain something that dramatic in your life.'' 
Which makes the dean's interviews with Marines a little tougher. ''They tend to play down their accomplishments,'' Mr. Rodgers said.
Life has come full circle for the military and Columbia. In 1947, Columbia opened its School of General Studies to accommodate returning World War II veterans whose education was financed by the G.I. Bill. During the Vietnam War protest years, veterans all but disappeared from campus and stayed disappeared for decades.
And now, in good part thanks to passage of the Post 9/11 G.I. Bill in 2008, veterans are returning in numbers not seen in half a century. Of the 1,500 undergraduates at Columbia's School of General Studies -- which serves older, nontraditional students -- 210 are veterans, up from 50 three years ago. (General Studies students take the same classes and get the same degree as other Columbia undergraduates.)
According to Wick Sloane, who writes a column for Inside Higher Ed, Columbia is the most aggressive recruiter of veterans among Ivy League colleges. Cornell is second, with 48.
A week ago, in his ''Doonesbury'' comic strip, Garry Trudeau took a swipe at other universities for not doing better. ''Athletes? Sure. Legacies? In spades,'' B. D., the Vietnam veteran, says to an admissions director. ''But veterans? Some of the country's most talented, motivated kids? Not so much!''
Yale, Mr. Trudeau's alma mater, has eight undergraduate veterans on the G.I. Bill, according to a spokeswoman.
Recruiting visits made by Mr. Rodgers and his admissions team include the Bronx High School of Science, Lycee Francais de New York, Milken Community High School in Los Angeles, Camp Lejeune in North Carolina and Camp Pendleton here in Southern California.
Columbia is one of 190 colleges in the Leadership Scholar Program, which helps Marines navigate the admissions process after leaving the Corps, although few visit bases to recruit.
In a day sitting in on interviews with the 10 applicants -- all in their mid-20s -- a pattern emerges: generally speaking, they once were lost, but now are found.
Mr. Rodgers asked Corporal Vickery why he had dropped out of Florida State University. ''My father died, and then six months later my mother died and I left to take care of my brother,'' he said. ''I didn't know what to do with myself and thought the Marines would give me a focus.''
Sergeant Watts described growing up in La Porte, Ind., with little direction or ambition. ''I came into the Marines kind of a wayward child,'' she said.
No more. She spent hours preparing for the interview. ''I've been reading extra hard,'' she said while waiting her turn. ''I did several practice interviews with my captain. He believes in me a lot. He told me I have nothing to worry about, I'm ready.''
Midday, Mr. Rodgers did a telephone interview from Afghanistan with Corporal Fritz, who spoke quite a bit about his love for debate in high school, and how he'd read novels like ''The Great Gatsby'' to learn about New York. The corporal did not mention that it was midnight there; or that he'd just gotten off a 12-hour shift; or that his job is to be rushed into combat to provide backup whenever a unit from the Seventh Marine Regiment is under attack.
After hanging up, Mr. Rodgers said, ''He got 2100 on his SATs.''
Mr. Rodgers brought along Columbia T-shirts for an information session with the Wounded Warrior Battalion. Most of the wounds -- whether shrapnel buried all over a body or post-traumatic stress disorder -- are invisible. So it was a little jarring when Staff Sgt. Jauntianne Saleigh, a counselor, raised her hand and said: ''You told us some form of standardized test score was required, but a lot of our Marines don't do well on standardized tests. They've suffered traumatic brain injury and have to learn to talk all over again.''
Mr. Rodgers said things were handled case by case.
Though applicants had been screened by the Marine command, there was a wide range of abilities. One corporal told Mr. Rodgers he would be taking introduction to algebra at Washtenaw Community College in Michigan in January, and hoped to enter Columbia next fall, majoring in economics and statistics.
Others would be strong candidates anywhere. In military language schools, Corporal King has learned Persian (Tehrani and Shirazi dialects); Dari, Pashto and Baluchi. During high school he had mastered German and Latin and was accepted at the University of Virginia and Emory, but as one of six children, he couldn't afford an elite school.
He is scheduled to be deployed for his second tour to Afghanistan next month, and he hopes to enter college in September.
Several of the Marines had asked Mr. Rodgers whether he thought they'd feel out of place at an Ivy League school, although it wasn't something Corporal King had thought much about. ''After surviving firefights, sitting on a college campus with someone who doesn't like me is the least of my worries,'' he said.
Corporal King said he was pleased with his interview, but he had forgotten to say one thing: ''I wanted to convey to Dean Rodgers that just because I served in Afghanistan doesn't mean I have P.T.S.D. and will be a mental health risk to an institution.''

HEADLINE: Is Mandatory Voting a Good Idea?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
William A. Galston (''Telling Americans to Vote, or Else,'' Sunday Review, Nov. 6) might have it backward regarding the cause and effect between low voter turnout and political polarization.
Many countries have fiercely polarized politics along with high voter turnout. The difference that Mr. Galston missed is that the American system inevitably ensures both polarization and low participation.
Without a parliamentary system, our winner-take-all politics means that most votes are indeed meaningless. For most people, voting does not lead to a greater sense of participation in government, but rather reminds them -- over and over -- that their voices are not represented. 
The problem is not voter turnout. It is a system of government that can never be responsive to the majority of its citizens.
ERIC ROSENBLOOM Hartland, Vt., Nov. 6, 2011
To the Editor:
William A. Galston correctly notes that compulsory voting laws increase voter turnout rates. But he leaves largely unexamined another significant and not politically neutral effect of these laws: compulsory voting increases the vote share of parties whose voters would otherwise tend to abstain.
Indeed, most of the democratic countries that adopted compulsory voting laws -- including Australia in 1924 -- did so less for the idealistic reasons of increasing turnout, as Mr. Galston suggests, and more to shore up the vote share of their particular governing parties.
That the vote boost from compulsory voting helps some parties -- and hurts others -- may explain why it is unlikely to be supported by American parties across the political spectrum.
BONNIE M. MEGUID Rochester, Nov. 6, 2011
The writer is an associate professor of political science at the University of Rochester.
To the Editor:
We could start by making Election Day a public holiday.
As things stand, too many people are unable to vote because they cannot take time off from work, or because they have a long commute, or because there are long lines before and after work when most people go to their polling places.
In particular, citizens who have the least representation and the least flexibility -- the poor and the young -- will get a chance to participate in our democracy.
NANDINI PANDYA Milford, Conn., Nov. 6, 2011
To the Editor:
Although mandating voting under threat of fine would produce important benefits for American political life, its legal obstacles are insurmountable without an amendment to the Constitution.
A direct mandate to vote lies beyond the enumerated powers of Congress; a mandate imposed by the states through the federal use of conditional spending (the ability of Congress to attach conditions for the acceptance of a federal grant by the states) might raise state autonomy concerns, even under our rather weak 10th Amendment jurisprudence; and a state mandate would run afoul of our free speech values, as nonparticipation is a valid mode of political dissent.
But voter participation could be encouraged by offering state and federal tax benefits to those who vote. The enhanced ability of Congress to compromise that would result from diminished political polarization would likely produce sufficient economic gains to offset losses in revenue from such a tax break given to those who discharge their civic duty.
MARK S. WEINER Hamden, Conn., Nov. 6, 2011

To the Editor:
Not voting is a vote. All votes are opinions, and not casting one expresses an opinion of the individual.

HEADLINE: Massachusetts Mulls Letting Bars Offer Happy Hours

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH

 BODY:
BOSTON -- This city has a robust bar culture, with trivia nights, $1 oyster specials and plenty of other perks to keep patrons coming. But not since 1984, when ''Cheers'' was new to television, has Massachusetts allowed bars to hold happy hours.
It looked as if that might change last month, when the State Senate passed an amendment that could pave the way for bars and restaurants to once again serve free or discounted drinks during certain time periods. 
The amendment's ultimate passage seems doubtful now. But it has rekindled an old debate, even provoking a stern warning from former Gov. Michael Dukakis, who signed the ban on happy hours 27 years ago.
The Senate last month included the amendment in its version of a bill allowing casinos in Massachusetts. Specifically, it gave bars and restaurants the same rights that casinos would have under a new ''gaming beverage license,'' citing as theoretical examples ''the right to give free alcoholic beverages to customers as part of promotions'' and ''drink specials that vary by night.''
State Senator Robert L. Hedlund, a restaurant owner who sponsored the amendment, said the idea was to put bars and restaurants on equal footing with the casinos that will be allowed to open in Massachusetts under legislation that is being completed in a conference committee. ''We have the most restrictive laws in the country on drink promotion except for Utah, a Mormon state,'' Mr. Hedlund said.
In 1984, Mr. Dukakis signed the happy hour ban as part of a broader effort to crack down on drunken driving. In a recent interview, Mr. Dukakis described the amendment as ''outrageous.''
''Unquestionably, people will lose their lives if this happens,'' he said.
Michael DiZio, a resident of Arlington, offered a more graphic prediction in a letter to The Boston Globe, writing, ''This will give badly needed employment to people in many sectors of our economy, including emergency room staffs, funeral home employees, grave diggers, and monument makers.''
But Mr. Hedlund said that tough drunken-driving laws save lives, not happy hour bans. And Jan Withers, the national president of Mothers Against Drunk Driving, said that while her group worried about anything that ''encourages excessive amounts of alcohol,'' it would not lobby against the amendment.
Nonetheless, Mr. Hedlund, a Republican, said the amendment appeared to be ''dead as a doornail'' in the conference committee of the Democratic-controlled legislature. He has changed tactics, asking the committee to authorize the state Alcoholic Beverages Control Commission to spend a year reviewing alcohol regulations that apply to bars and restaurants and recommend revisions.
''We're not asking for free booze or happy hour,'' he said. ''We're asking for them to look at some of the flaws that exist in the regulations.''
At the Asgard, a pub in Cambridge that was doing brisk business at dusk on Tuesday, Emily Alexander, who was unwinding with a $5.50 beer, said she would appreciate opportunities for cheaper drinks. When she moved to Massachusetts in September, she said, she was ''very surprised'' to find out happy hours were forbidden here. ''I'm a grad student; I can't afford a bunch of drinks,'' said Ms. Alexander, 23. ''So I'd love it if they did it. I have a ton of friends in D.C., and that's what they do after work.''
But down the street at the Cantab Lounge, a neighborhood bar, Richard Fitzgerald, the longtime owner, said he had no use for happy hours.
''I don't see any sense in selling stuff for half price,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Cuomo Tries To Shore Up The Support Of Minorities

BYLINE: By THOMAS KAPLAN

 BODY:
SAN JUAN, P.R. -- The crowd of Hispanic legislators and business leaders from New York, sipping cocktails at a sleek hotel overlooking the Atlantic Ocean, abruptly halted their conversations as Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, fresh off a 1,600-mile flight, came in through a side entrance on Friday.
Well-wishers pulled out their cellphones and digital cameras and swarmed the governor -- so many that it took him several minutes to cross the room and make his way to the microphone.
Assemblyman Felix W. Ortiz, a Brooklyn Democrat, introduced Mr. Cuomo as ''a real friend and a real hero of the Hispanic community,'' and declared that no governor in recent times had been more supportive of Latinos. Mr. Cuomo, in turn, declared his support for bringing diversity to state government and promised to push for action to combat joblessness among minority youths. 
The enthusiasm that greeted Mr. Cuomo almost, but not quite, obscured the underlying reason he chose this conference, called Somos el Futuro, for his first official out-of-state trip since his inauguration.
Over the last several weeks, the governor has been lavishing attention on minority communities amid signs that some were growing impatient with what they perceived as a lack of attention to their concerns.
The governor's signature economic measure thus far -- a property tax cap -- does not affect New York City residents, and he opposes a top priority for many minority lawmakers: an extension of the state's so-called millionaires' tax, which is to expire on Dec. 31. His travel itinerary has focused heavily on New York City suburbs and upstate communities; when he toured the state to describe his legislative priorities this year, he did not hold a single event in a minority neighborhood in New York City. In July, The Amsterdam News, a black newspaper, published an article with the headline, ''Black Community to Andrew Cuomo: Where Are You?''
Some minority lawmakers have signaled an intent to step up pressure on the Democratic governor, especially if it becomes clear that the outlook for next year's state budget is grim. Assemblyman Peter M. Rivera, a Bronx Democrat, said that Mr. Cuomo's first-year spending plan ''has caused and will cause tremendous suffering within communities of need.'' When the governor was urged to raise money by renewing higher taxes on high-income earners, Mr. Rivera said, ''The governor feels completely the opposite from what we're trying to say.''
''There is an effort afoot to remind the governor of his base and to remind him that we're in for real tough times,'' Mr. Rivera said.
Mr. Cuomo, who grew up in Queens and now lives in Westchester County, is steeped in issues affecting minority communities: he founded a nonprofit organization in the 1980s that provided transitional housing for the homeless, and during the Clinton administration, he served as secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. He enjoys high popularity, not only among the general public, but also among black and Hispanic leaders. And the governor's forceful -- and successful -- advocacy of same-sex marriage has won him enormous good will among liberals, often overshadowing what appears to be a growing, if restrained, critique from the left of the governor's economic agenda.
''There are those things that I feel personally very strongly about as a progressive that he's strong on,'' said Melissa Mark-Viverito, a New York City councilwoman, born in Puerto Rico, who represents parts of northern Manhattan and the Bronx. ''But from the economic justice perspective, I'm very conflicted, because I don't see the level of leadership that I think we need.''
Mr. Cuomo is clearly paying attention. On the day before his trip here, Mr. Cuomo announced the appointments of two Hispanics to posts in his administration; he had named two other minority officials to jobs the week before.
In recent weeks, he has tried to reassure lawmakers that while his legislative agenda this year was not focused on many city-oriented issues, that would change in the future. In September, he gave a speech about gun violence at a breakfast before the African-American Day Parade. And last month, he met with members of the New York State Black, Puerto Rican, Hispanic and Asian Legislative Caucus in his office in Midtown Manhattan to discuss their priorities.
In his 11-minute speech here on Friday, Mr. Cuomo cited several achievements of his first months in office: doubling the state's goal for participation by businesses owned by members of minority groups and women in state contracting; suspending the state's participation in a controversial federal immigration enforcement plan; closing some prisons and juvenile justice centers and directing state agencies to provide free interpretation and translation services in six foreign languages.
But Mr. Cuomo's fiscal conservatism, most visibly exemplified by his refusal to consider extending the state's temporary income tax surcharge on high-earning New Yorkers, may be a fault line. Democrats in the Legislature, now energized by the Occupy Wall Street movement, are urgently pushing for its renewal, while Mr. Cuomo, backed by legislative Republicans, has repeatedly said that he opposes the tax because it would place New York at a competitive disadvantage with its neighbors. (He has said that he would support a federal millionaires' tax that applied equally to residents of all states.)
Charles Barron, a city councilman who ran against Mr. Cuomo last year, heckled him with chants of ''Tax the rich!'' when the governor spoke at an annual dinner of minority legislators last winter. But so far, most lawmakers have refrained from directly criticizing Mr. Cuomo.
''Is there frustration with the governor regarding the millionaires' tax? Yes,'' said Assemblyman Keith L. T. Wright, the Manhattan Democratic Party chairman.
''There's frustration in every community, not just the black or Latino, but in every community,'' Mr. Wright said. ''Do I want the millionaires' tax? Of course I do. But this governor has made some very, very hard decisions, and I'm quite happy that he's there, because I've been around when it's been worse.''
Some lawmakers acknowledged that Mr. Cuomo had blunted the fallout from his rift with fellow Democrats.
''He's doing a lot of things we like,'' said Assemblyman Herman D. Farrell Jr., a Manhattan Democrat. ''There is a little problem with the millionaires' tax, but that is a discussion, that's not a divorce. But other than that, in everything else, I think people are quite satisfied with what he does.''
Many minority lawmakers are looking toward the next legislative session, which begins in January, as they seek to enlist Mr. Cuomo's support on a range of issues.
For example, State Senator Jose R. Peralta, a Queens Democrat, wants Mr. Cuomo to promote legislation that would require microstamping, a form of ballistics identification, on all new semiautomatic handguns, and to provide money to keep foreclosure prevention programs up and running.
Assemblyman Hakeem Jeffries, a Brooklyn Democrat, said he would like to see the governor pay more attention to affordable housing and gun violence next year. After a strong first year in office for Mr. Cuomo, Mr. Jeffries said, ''It's now appropriate to supplement that start with additional substantive accomplishments'' on issues relevant to minority communities.
''The mature political approach is to work with your friends on the issues where there's common ground, and to try and push them where there's areas of disagreement,'' Mr. Jeffries said. ''It's just not productive to throw bombs at a governor who's got three additional years and who we have to work together with to get some things accomplished.''

HEADLINE: Alternate-Side Parking Brings Peace

BYLINE: By ALAN DRAPER. 
Alan Draper is a political scientist at St. Lawrence University.

 BODY:
Canton, N.Y.
EUROPE can't seem to cope with diversity. Controversies over head scarves in France, police brutality in Britain, minarets in Switzerland, and the success of xenophobic right-wing parties in Austria, the Netherlands and Belgium, reveal the depths of the challenge. 
As European countries try to integrate immigrants from Africa, South Asia and the Middle East, they have found the transition from a homogeneous society to a multicultural one painful. The economic fallout from the euro zone debt crisis is likely to make assimilation even harder.
In its search for solutions, Europe would do well to look to the streets -- of New York City. Seriously.
The city's alternate-side parking calendar, which sets out the holidays when street-cleaning rules are suspended (so drivers don't have to move their cars), is actually a model for managing the challenges of diversity.
Over decades, the calendar has grown to include numerous holidays that are sacred to various religions. And we're not just talking Passover and Good Friday, Yom Kippur and Christmas. There's Id al-Fitr and Id al-Adha for Muslims; the Solemnity of the Ascension, the Feast of the Assumption and the Immaculate Conception for Roman Catholics; and a raft of Jewish holidays from Shavuot and Succoth to Shemini Atzeret and Simhat Torah. The parking rules are also suspended on certain cultural holidays, like the Asian Lunar New Year, Rosh Hashana and Diwali, the South Asian festival of lights.
Observing these holidays -- even if only for the purpose of street cleaning -- is not just a symbolic way of acknowledging religious and cultural pluralism. Their existence on the alternate-side calendar alongside civic and legal holidays, like Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Presidents' Day, Labor Day and Thanksgiving, when schools and government buildings are closed, helps to normalize the idea of diversity.
Europe should follow this example. It needs to recognize and celebrate the distinctive identities of its citizens at the same time that it reflects and promotes what unites them. Negotiating the tension between what divides and binds a community together is never easy; even little steps help.
Holidays are particularly fraught because they reflect a kind of state recognition. That is why a multilevel approach to the public sphere -- in which some holidays are celebrated by, say, the suspension of street cleaning and parking regulations, while others that recognize more communal anniversaries are observed in more meaningful ways -- is so attractive. It acknowledges both diversity and unity.
As New Yorkers are aware, even holidays celebrated by one group can have salutary, binding effects for society. Groups who might be adversaries elsewhere -- Palestinians and Israelis, Indians and Pakistanis -- can unite in their appreciation of each other's holidays because it saves them all from the drudgery of having to move their cars.
In fact, if residents had their way, countless holidays observed by immigrant New Yorkers and their families would be added to the calendar. If every group seeking recognition in this fashion succeeded, the streets would get awfully dirty. But everyone would believe that the streets belonged to them.

HEADLINE: Occupy Protesters Shift Focus to Campuses

BYLINE: By MALIA WOLLAN and ELIZABETH A. HARRIS; Malia Wollan reported from Berkeley and Elizabeth A. Harris from New York. Jess Bidgood contributed reporting from Boston, and Lee van der Voo from Portland, Ore.

 BODY:
BERKELEY, Calif. -- Goodbye, city park, hello, college green.
As city officials around the country move to disband Occupy Wall Street encampments amid growing concerns over health and public safety, protesters have begun to erect more tents on college campuses.
''We are trying to get mass numbers of students out,'' said Natalia Abrams, 31, a graduate of the University of California, Los Angeles, and an organizer with Occupy Colleges, a national group coordinating college-based protesters.
Though only a handful of colleges have encampments, tents went up last week at Harvard in Cambridge, Mass., and here at the University of California, Berkeley. Additionally, protesters in California have vowed to occupy dozens of other campuses in the coming days.
Last Wednesday at Berkeley, about 3,000 people gathered on Sproul Plaza to protest tuition increases, and many then set up a camp. Demonstrators linked arms to protect their tents, but police officers broke through and took down more than a dozen tents, arresting about 40 protesters. 
University officials said they had watched city governments struggle to deal with expanding campsites and decided to take a stricter line: no tents, no sleeping, period.
''The present struggles with entrenched encampments in Oakland, San Francisco and New York City led us to conclude that we must uphold our policy,'' the university chancellor, Robert J. Birgeneau, said in a statement.
''Our experience with these encampments is that they are never temporary,'' said Claire Holmes, a university spokeswoman. ''We've had a long-term encampment at People's Park for 43 years.''
Over the weekend, local governments across the country moved to keep Occupy protesters from establishing that sort of tenure.
In Salt Lake City, permits that allowed people associated with the movement to camp in a downtown park, Pioneer Park, were revoked on Friday after a man was found dead. Demonstrators were given about 24 hours to clear out, according to Lt. Scott White of the Salt Lake City Police Department, before the officers moved in on Saturday night to remove those who remained. The police said that 19 people had been arrested.
The same night, protesters in Denver were forced out of their encampment, the second park they have had to leave since demonstrations began. Seventeen people were arrested, the police said.
A police crackdown at Kiener Plaza in St. Louis ended with 27 arrests on Friday night, the local police said, and The Associated Press reported that 24 people were arrested in Albany on Saturday for remaining in a state-owned park past an 11 p.m. curfew.
But protesters in Oakland, Calif., managed to outlast a threat of eviction on Saturday, defying the city's second demand in two days that they clear out. Those calls began after a man was shot near the protest area on Thursday. On Sunday, demonstrators received a third notice from the city demanding they stop camping in city parks.
The mood in Oakland has been tense and angry since Scott Olsen, 24, an Iraq war veteran, was critically injured at a protest in October. Friends confirmed Sunday that Mr. Olsen was released from the hospital last week. Dottie Guy of Iraq Veterans Against the War told The A.P. that he can now read and write, but that he still has trouble talking.
Demonstrators in Portland, Ore., staved off eviction on Saturday with the help of hundreds of supporters who poured into two city parks near each other, Lownsdale Square and Chapman Square, and a nearby street as a midnight eviction deadline passed. About 60 people on bicycles circled the area, while drumming, dancing and juggling lent a festive air.
On Sunday, however, The A.P. reported that the number of protesters there had thinned tremendously, and that police officers in riot gear had moved in to empty the parks, surrounding protesters and shoving some of them with nightsticks. At least one officer said through a loudspeaker that anyone who resisted arrest might be ''subject to chemical agents and impact weapons,'' The A.P. said.
By midafternoon, the area was cleared of protesters and fenced off, while crews cleaned up debris inside. The Portland Police Department's spokesman said that more than a dozen had been arrested.
In Berkeley, the history of encampments stretches back to 1969, when student protesters seized a plot of university land now known as People's Park. In the violent mayhem that followed, the police shot dozens of demonstrators, killing one man.
In the decades since, efforts by the university to develop or alter the park -- now used mostly by the homeless -- have met with protests.
Despite that combustible history, the zero-tent policy and the campus police's apparent willingness to enforce it with batons (as they did Wednesday), the Berkeley protesters say camping is an integral part of their strategy.
Over the weekend, members of the protest group Occupy Cal gathered tents and tarps to rebuild their camp. They have called for a general strike and a mass camp-out at all 10 University of California campuses, 23 state university campuses and 112 community college campuses, starting Tuesday.
''Encampment is one of the most powerful forms of peaceful civil disobedience,'' said Marco Amaral, 20, a third-year student majoring in political science and political economics who said he was involved in the protests in part because his parents lost their Las Vegas home to foreclosure.
On campuses elsewhere, officials have been more hospitable.
At Duke University in Durham, N.C., Shreyan Sen, 19, a senior physics major, pitched his tent on a university lawn more than two weeks ago. Between classes, Mr. Sen goes to the four-tent bivouac to run teach-ins. So far, campus administrators have been very accommodating, he said.
Campuses offer amenities not available to protesters inhabiting parks, like hot showers, indoor pools and cafeterias. ''We have restrooms right here, so that's not an issue,'' Mr. Sen said.
The Harvard encampment, much like the university itself, is highly exclusive. After protesters set up about 30 tents in Harvard Yard last week, university officials closed the gates to the yard, allowing only students with IDs to enter.
''Securing access to the Yard is necessary for the safety of the freshmen and others who live and work there, for the students who will be sleeping outdoors as part of the protest, and for the overall campus,'' the university's provost, Alan M. Garber, said in a statement.
Harvard protesters set up their tent city a week after a student walkout of Economics 10, an undergraduate course taught by N. Gregory Mankiw, a professor and former economic adviser to President George W. Bush.
''We think that Harvard is complicit in propagating the ideology that made the current crisis possible,'' said Amanda Haziz-Ginsburg, a camper who is a student at Harvard Divinity School.
Back in Berkeley, Mr. Amaral worried that Occupy Cal would have a hard time rounding up enough tents. ''It's a hard thing to donate your tent knowing the police are going to take it,'' he said.

HEADLINE: How Romney Could Win

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER

 BODY:
Election Day is nearly a year off and the first primaries aren't until January, but I'm ready to skip ahead to the main event. The last serious hope of the Tea Partiers, Rick Perry, and their last not-so-serious hope, Herman Cain, are in campaign death spirals. Unless God has a cruel sense of humor, Newt Gingrich will pass like a tantrum. That leaves us with a general election between two serious and certifiably sane candidates. Phew!!
If you want to go into hibernation now and re-emerge in August for the campaign home stretch, I understand. But just to put the season of vaudeville firmly behind us, let's contemplate the choice that awaits: two confident, intelligible, no-drama, rather distant men, each of whom seems to have overcompensated for bigot-arousing origins (Obama's race, Romney's religion) by being rational to a fault. 
Despite efforts to polarize our politics into ideological base camps, in presidential elections the deciding vote still belongs to the middle. These voters have been drowned out lately by the Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street, but they are the main prize in 2012. Bruce Gyory, who is a consultant and teaches voting trends at the State University of New York at Albany, calls them the ''40 within 40'' -- 40 percent of the electorate self-identify as independent, and 40 percent of those independents describe themselves as moderate. That means about one in six voters are up for grabs. Obama won them in 2008. The Democrats lost them badly in 2010.
We cannot know whose advertising arsenal will be most effective, which candidate will excel in the debates, or what blunders might tilt the outcome. We don't know whether the MoveOn left or the evangelical right will simply stay home. We don't know if Ron Paul will siphon off some of his libertarian devout into a third-party run. But we can, even at this distance, imagine the arguments that will be made to win over those decisive swing voters for Romney. Here are four.
THE NOT-OBAMA CASE Just as a series of Republican improbables competed for the role of Not-Mitt, Romney is now Not-Obama, an alternative vessel not only for those who have loathed Obama all along but for the disenchanted Obama voters of 2008. I've argued elsewhere that the disappointments of Obama's first term are exaggerated and only in part his fault. But the sense of frustration is real. To be sure, Romney is not going to get voters who are upset that Obama failed to be Dennis Kucinich, but he will surely pursue those less ideological voters who invested hope in Obama, who still want him to succeed, but who are starting to believe what will be Romney's main message: Obama is a nice guy, but in over his head.
O.K., Romney is not Obama, but who the heck is he? He may have been, as he stressed last week, an unwavering Mormon all his life, but on the issues he's been born-again, again and again. His reincarnations on social issues, the environment, taxes and health care, combined with an oleaginous affect, present Romney with a serious authenticity problem.
Still, that decisive middle is in a sullen mood. In the elections of 2006, 2008 and 2010, Gyory notes, ''Their vote has been swung as if it were Thor's hammer against incumbents.'' If Obama can't convincingly offer moderate voters a better direction for the country, they will cast their lot with change, even if it is not change they entirely believe in.
THE C.E.O.-PRESIDENT CASE The disgust with government is so pervasive that private-sector credentials have particular appeal. At the Bain management consulting and equity investment companies, Romney made a reputation as a problem-fixer, an aura enhanced by his role in cleaning up the scandal-plagued Salt Lake City Olympics and his penchant for 59-point job plans.
But Romney's role in the private sector was as a ruthless efficiency machine, a downsizer and outsourcer -- in short, his critics say, a job-killer. When Romney challenged Ted Kennedy for the Senate in 1994, the Democratic campaign guru Robert Shrum prepared ads featuring the misery of workers streamlined out of jobs by Bain Capital. Watch for the sequel in 2012.
Romney can counter, with justification, that making companies more efficient assures their survival and long-term growth. But as an empathetic message, it's just a notch more winning than ''Let them eat cake.''
THE TAMING-CONGRESS CASE Those swing voters, polls suggest, want pretty much what Obama wants: short-term stimulus (middle-class tax relief, infrastructure investments, money to keep teachers and cops on the job) and long-term discipline (including some new tax revenue). But Obama has had little success budging the mulish intransigents on Capitol Hill.
Jonathan Chait, no apologist for the Republicans, argued recently that the best way to break the impasse might be to elect Romney. If Romney went to Capitol Hill with some version of the grand bargain, Chait wrote, most Republicans ''would see the need to rescue the economy under a fellow Republican's presidency, and sheer political expediency would trump all.'' Romney constantly points that as governor he worked across party lines to balance the budget. (He does not point out that he did it in part by raising taxes and fees.)
The Democrats will retort that the Republican Party is hostage to its dogmatically antigovernment Tea Party minority, and Romney is, too. Remember that chillingly defining moment when the Republican candidates were asked if they would reject a deal that included $10 of spending cuts for just $1 in tax hikes? Romney's hand was raised with the rest of them. Swing voters would have taken the 10-to-1 deal in a heartbeat.
So Democrats will paint Romney as a rubber stamp for Congressional Republicans who want to coddle the rich, fix the economy on the backs of the middle class and seniors, and let Wall Street and the polluters write their own rules. Mindful of the polls showing the popularity of that Congress at about 9 percent, they will try to make Romney and Eric Cantor seem like running mates.
I think Romney will not be easy to tar with the zealot brush, though, precisely because he's so lacking in passion. ''Mitt is hard to love,'' says a Republican who has worked for him. ''But for the same reasons, he's hard to hate.''
THE NOT-THAT-CONSERVATIVE CASE Moderate swing voters would have been more in tune with the old blue-state Romney who -- as The Washington Post recalled the other day -- once courted activists for gay rights, abortion and environmental protection, promising to be their GOP BFF in Washington. Romney's camp is counting on those issues to be dwarfed by economic concerns, but moderates may be queasy about the new Romney, who declares he would ''absolutely'' support a law saying that human life begins at conception, who has pledged to support federal laws against same-sex marriage, and whose environmental platform sounds like Sarah Palin's.
The old Romney is not going to reemerge, but a moderate might console himself that Romney is unlikely to spend a lot of energy on rolling back the tide of civil rights. That's not what he cares about. Anyway, these issues are being decided mostly in the states and the courts. Put another way, if the far right hates Romney, how bad can he be?
But, as Peter Beinart pointed out recently, President Romney would inherit a permanent conservative infrastructure of think tanks, lobbyists and members of Congress that constrains any Republican administration. ''It doesn't matter all that much what Romney really believes, or whether he believes much of anything,'' Beinart observed. ''Romney will be a very conservative president because that's the only kind of president a Republican can be these days.''
To which I would add just two words: Supreme Court.
Meanwhile, if you find yourself hungering for the days when politics had heart, buy Bill Clinton's new book. You may find, as I did, that you kind of miss him.

HEADLINE: Obama Talks Up Free Trade and Jobs at Asia-Pacific Meeting

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
HONOLULU -- With the weak domestic economy and his re-election hopes as the backdrop, President Obama made job creation the theme of an annual trade summit meeting on Sunday as the United States, for the first time in nearly two decades, hosted leaders of Pacific Rim nations.
''I want to emphasize that the Asia-Pacific region is absolutely critical to America's economic growth. We consider it a top priority,'' Mr. Obama said as he opened the daylong meeting near Hawaii's capital. ''And we consider it a top priority because we're not going to be able to put our folks back to work and grow our economy and expand opportunity unless the Asia-Pacific region is also successful.'' 
At a press conference after the session ended, Mr. Obama said, ''No region will do more to shape our long-term economic future.''
Although Mr. Obama's remarks at the opening of the closed-door gathering were directed to the leaders of 20 other economies on both sides of the Pacific Ocean, they were clearly intended as much for American voters.
Free trade, especially in his Democratic Party but increasingly among Republicans as well, often carries a negative association, evoking notions of American jobs being shipped overseas to lower-wage nations and of unfair competition from countries like China or Japan.
But Mr. Obama used the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum to promote what he and many economists believe are the benefits of free trade and competition in terms of creating jobs in export industries -- even as he also challenges trading partners, China in particular, to take down barriers to open trade.
The president will hammer at that jobs theme this week as he continues on his eight-day trip around the Pacific. He goes next to Australia, with which the United States has a trade surplus, and then to Indonesia for meetings with many of the same leaders -- including those from China -- at the East Asia Summit and the gathering of the Association of South East Asian Nations.
But the president's trip comes at a time when China-bashing -- and criticism of Mr. Obama for not being tough on Beijing -- has become a staple among some Republicans seeking their party's presidential nomination.
Mr. Obama did not mention China in his opening remarks at the diplomatic roundtable on Sunday. Smaller Asian nations, fearful of China's rising economic and military strength, have welcomed Mr. Obama's signals of greater engagement in their region as a counterbalance to China.
At the press conference, Mr. Obama said, ''We welcome the peaceful rise of China. It is in America's interest to see China succeed.''
But he said he also told President Hu Jintao and other Chinese leaders, ''There are a range of things that they have done that disadvantage not just the United States but a whole host of their trading partners and countries in the region'' -- in particular, valuing their currency so low that ''our exports to China are that much more expensive,'' and failing to protect the intellectual property rights of American exporters.
Though the meeting, as expected, did not produce significant policy agreements among the trading partners, Mr. Obama described progress in addressing the three areas he set for the agenda: increasing trade and investment, promoting green jobs, and streamlining and coordinating the nations' regulations related to commerce and trade.
The president seeks lower tariffs for green technology, like wind turbines and solar panels. China's tariffs on American products and state subsidies for its companies are a major dispute between the two nations; China has come to dominate the global green-technology sector while American companies have struggled or gone bankrupt -- including, notably, Solyndra, the subject of an investigation by Congressional Republicans for the loans it received from the Obama administration.
The 21 members of the group are described as economies rather than nations because they include Taiwan, which China claims as its own, and Hong Kong, which is now part of China.
Because the forum mainly deals with trade relations rather than regional security issues, Mr. Obama as host was eager to have Congress's approval beforehand for three free-trade pacts with South Korea, Colombia and Panama that had languished since the Bush administration -- largely because of opposition from Democrats, including Mr. Obama.
But he won changes from the other nations on labor and environmental provisions, and Congress recently approved all three, giving Mr. Obama boasting rights in time for the meeting.

HEADLINE: Costume Shot Unnecessary, Obama Says

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
HONOLULU -- Is the ''silly shirts'' photo of Asia-Pacific leaders now history?
To the chagrin of White House photographers but the relief of the 21 leaders at the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum that took place over the weekend, President Obama, as the host this year, packed away for good the two-decade tradition of having the group pose for a ''family photo'' in some garb representative of the host country. 
''I got rid of the Hawaiian shirts because I looked at pictures of some of the previous APEC meetings and some of the garb that appeared previously and I thought this might be a tradition that we might want to break,'' Mr. Obama said during a news conference Sunday. ''I suggested to leaders, we gave them a shirt and I promise you if they wanted to wear it that would have been fine, but I didn't hear a lot of complaints about breaking precedent.''
There was speculation in recent weeks that Mr. Obama had provided Hawaiian shirts, grass hula skirts or even surfer-dude wet suits representative of his childhood home. That might seem implausible but for the precedents of past summit meetings -- which have included ponchos and what looked like gowns for pregnant bridesmaids.
Mr. Obama suggested as much two years ago, when it was announced that Hawaii would be the site of the 2011 forum. More recently, a fake White House Web site stoked the speculation by putting three options -- Aloha Attire, Hula Dancer and Wet Suit, modeled by Photoshopped illustrations of the leaders -- to a vote.
Late Saturday the faux Web site divulged that the winner was... Hula Dancer.
It was hard to imagine that Mr. Obama -- he of cool reserve, given to unflashy white shirts and plain ties -- would ever submit to such apparel. And indeed, he and the other leaders were photographed together on Sunday in the usual dark business suits and ties, except of course for the only woman in the group, Prime Minister Julia Gillard of Australia.
The break could well mean the end of the tradition since it actually marks the second consecutive year that the leaders skipped native costumes.
The tradition started innocently enough in 1993, when the United States last hosted the gathering, in Seattle, and President Bill Clinton distributed bomber jackets for the group shot. Subsequent sartorial highlights included two ponchos -- colorfully striped in Chile and brown in Peru; pastel ''hanboks'' in South Korea with bow-like trim that resembled (female) wedding wear; and silk tunics in Vietnam.
While the so-called ''silly shirts'' photos became the defining highlight of APEC meetings, many leaders came to dread them as lending a comic aspect to the proceedings at their expense. The fake White House feature included past photos, saying, ''As you can see, the APEC leaders clearly enjoy posing for the traditional 'silly shirts' photo and are good sports despite some dubious choices made over the years.''

HEADLINE: In Health Law, Asking Where U.S. Power Stops

BYLINE: By ADAM LIPTAK

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- If the federal government can require people to purchase health insurance, what else can it force them to do? More to the point, what can't the government compel citizens to do?
Those questions have been the toughest ones for the Obama administration's lawyers to answer in court appearances around the country over the past six months. And they are likely to emerge again if, as expected, the Supreme Court, as early as Monday, agrees to be the final arbiter of the challenge to President Obama's signature health care initiative.
The case focuses on whether Congress overstepped its constitutional authority in enacting parts of the law. Lower courts have reached divergent conclusions.
Even judges in lower courts who ultimately voted to uphold the law have homed in on the question of the limits of government power, at times flummoxing Justice Department lawyers. 
''Let's go right to what is your most difficult problem,'' Judge Laurence H. Silberman, who later voted to uphold the law, told a lawyer at an argument in September before the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. ''What limiting principle do you articulate?'' If Congress may require people to purchase health insurance, he asked, what else can it force them to buy? Where do you draw the line?
Would it be unconstitutional, he asked, to require people to buy broccoli?
''No,'' said the lawyer, Beth S. Brinkmann. ''It depends.''
Could people making more than $500,000 be required to buy cars from General Motors to keep it in business?
''I would have to know much more about the empirical findings,'' she replied.
Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, who ended up in dissent, then jumped in. ''How about mandatory retirement accounts replacing Social Security?'' he asked.
''It would depend,'' Ms. Brinkmann replied.
Ms. Brinkmann was cut off before she could elaborate on her answers. In other settings, she and other administration lawyers have described what they see as the constitutional limits to government power, though not typically using concrete examples.
They have said, for instance, that laws authorized by the Constitution's commerce clause must be economic in nature, must concern interstate commerce and must address national problems.
They have also said that the health care market is unique. And they have suggested that questions about constitutional limits can miss the point. The only question actually before the courts, they said, is whether the particular law under review was within Congress's authority. Other cases, they said, can be decided as they arise. But there is reason to think that at least some Supreme Court justices will want to hear what a ruling in favor of the health care law implies and what precedent it sets.
In 1995, when the court struck down a federal law that prohibited people from carrying firearms in school zones, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote that ''we pause to consider the implications of the government's arguments'' in defending the law -- that stopping activities that could lead to violent crime relates to interstate commerce because it affects ''national productivity.''
Under that reasoning, Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote, ''It is difficult to perceive any limitation on federal power,'' adding that ''if we were to accept the government's arguments, we are hard pressed to posit any activity by an individual that Congress is without power to regulate.''
Chief Justice Rehnquist died in 2005, but three of the justices who joined his majority opinion -- Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas -- are still on the court.
The concerns expressed by Chief Justice Rehnquist amount to what lawyers call the slippery slope. Many judges are reluctant to issue rulings without some sense of what their consequences will be in other cases.
But defenders of the health care law say that such concerns are not a reason to doubt its validity.
''Slippery slope arguments are themselves often slippery,'' Walter Dellinger, who was acting solicitor general in the administration of President Bill Clinton, told the Senate Judiciary Committee in February. He gave an example. ''If it is within the scope of regulating commerce to set a minimum wage,'' he said, ''one might argue, then Congress could set the minimum wage at $5,000 an hour.'' But that would never happen, he said, for practical, political and legal reasons.
When a divided three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, based in Atlanta, struck down in August the mandate that individuals purchase and maintain health insurance from private companies, slippery slopes were very much on the minds of the judges in the majority.
''The government's position amounts to an argument that the mere fact of an individual's existence substantially affects interstate commerce, and therefore Congress may regulate them at every point of their life,'' Chief Judge Joel F. Dubina and Judge Frank M. Hull wrote.
On Tuesday, on the other hand, a three-judge panel of the District of Columbia Circuit upheld the law. Judge Silberman, who had grilled Ms. Brinkmann so aggressively, wrote the majority opinion, and his discussion of the limits of Congressional power may have handed the administration a bigger victory than it wanted, because it presumably did not want to win on the grounds that Congress could do anything at all.
Judge Silberman said he remained troubled by what he called ''the government's failure to advance any clear doctrinal principles limiting Congressional mandates that any American purchase any product or service in interstate commerce.''
Then he adopted a version of Mr. Dellinger's argument.
''That a direct requirement for most Americans to purchase any product or services seems an intrusive exercise of legislative power,'' Judge Silberman wrote, ''surely explains why Congress has not used this authority before -- but that seems to us a political judgment rather than a recognition of constitutional limitations.''
Judge Silberman said there were Supreme Court decisions on issues like regulating the use of medical marijuana that had endorsed broad Congressional power to legislate in the name of commerce.
''It certainly is an encroachment on individual liberty,'' he wrote of the health care law, ''but it is no more so than a command that restaurants or hotels are obliged to serve all customers regardless of race, that gravely ill individuals cannot use a substance their doctors described as the only effective palliative for excruciating pain, or that a farmer cannot grow enough wheat to support his own family.''
In dissent, Judge Kavanaugh praised the majority for its honesty in describing what followed from its ruling.
''The majority opinion here is quite candid -- and accurate,'' he wrote, adding: ''The majority opinion's holding means, for example, that a law replacing Social Security with a system of mandatory private retirement accounts would be constitutional. So would a law mandating that parents purchase private college savings accounts.''
Within hours of the decision on Tuesday, opponents of the health care law were issuing statements, and their theme was predictable. ''Like the government,'' said Randy E. Barnett, a law professor at Georgetown, ''the majority could identify no limit to an unprecedented power of Congress.''

HEADLINE: In a Job-Creation Experiment, New York Regions Are Vying for Development Cash

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME

 BODY:
Think of it as ''American Idol'' for policy wonks and economic development types.
So western New York is heralding ''bi-national logistics,'' energy, health and life sciences; the Mohawk Valley is vowing to reinvent itself through advanced high-tech manufacturing; the North Country claims it will ''lead the economic renaissance of New York's small cities and rural communities''; Long Island's plan envisions an accelerated transition to a more high-tech and more socially equitable suburban future.
New York City's plan has a heavy emphasis on projects outside its most prosperous precincts, including the Hunts Point market in the South Bronx and an environmentally friendly manufacturing center in the Brooklyn Navy Yard. 
Combining two national obsessions -- job creation and beauty-pageant-style competition -- 10 regional councils across New York State must submit by Monday detailed five-year economic development proposals for $200 million that will go directly to the councils for projects in their area. In addition, a pool of $800 million will be available to individual applicants.
The project is Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo's game plan for economic development, and it comes at a time when two things seem clear: virtually every state in the country is desperate to create jobs, and no place is certain how to do it.
The theory behind the process is that rather than doling out pork ad hoc; the usual default positions behind stadiums, convention centers and cobblestone downtown streets; and infamous sinkholes like the New York State Museum of Cheese, state support for economic development should flow from a realistic, on-the-ground assessment of regional economies, resources and opportunities.
How much this proves to be an abstract exercise and how much it produces actual jobs remains to be seen. Still, almost everyone involved in the process and many outside it give Mr. Cuomo high marks for his framework for something that could prove more difficult than his earlier successes with legalizing same-sex marriage and passing a tough state budget.
''There is a sense that postrecession, we need a radically different kind of growth model that is not investing in the wrong things, and New York is in the vanguard of this,'' said Bruce Katz, an expert on state economic development strategies at the Brookings Institution.
''What you usually have in government is lots of different programs all created for different reasons with no adding up, no synthesis, no leveraging of all these disparate pieces,'' he said. ''What you have here is a more strategic process, more aligned with the distinctive assets and distinctive advantages of different parts of the state. That's smart economic development.''
Building on the empowerment zones that Mr. Cuomo championed as secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, New York's new approach begins with 10 regional economic development councils: public-private partnerships composed of local figures in business, academia, local government and nongovernmental organizations. Over the past two and a half months, the councils -- sometimes with feverish all-nighters as the deadline approaches -- have been putting together economic plans based on each region's strengths in business, location and natural resources.
The plans and drafts play out in a mix of regional promotion, sometimes wonky language about ''innovation ecosystems,'' and regional brands and specific programs for enterprises like the Mohawk Valley Microenterprise Grant Fund or the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus.
Participants say the process has been a rare case of bottom-up planning in which each region is setting its own priorities rather than awaiting manna from Albany. And if the dollars mean more, say, in the Finger Lakes than in New York City, representatives of both populous regions and more rural ones say the planning process has had huge advantages across the board.
''This has been a conversation that really doesn't take place anywhere else,'' said Kathryn S. Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City. ''Usually we look at development deal by deal, transaction by transaction. New York State has spent billions over the past 25 years and has virtually nothing to show for it because there was no plan. To that extent, this can be a game-changer.''
In the first phase of the process, a review panel, whose members have not yet been selected by Mr. Cuomo, will compare the proposals and split $200 million of state aid among the 10 councils, with the top four plans receiving $40 million each to be applied toward their priority capital projects. The remaining $40 million will be split among the other six councils according to the merit of their plans.
Individual applicants had until Nov. 1 to apply for an additional $800 million, available through a simplified online application process, that will be evaluated and graded by the regional councils and then by the state agencies. The money is all existing budgeted financing, and decisions are due by the end of the year.
Skeptics question whether governments can truly create jobs in some innovative way, short of striking oil, luring companies with tax breaks or being lucky enough to have a Steve Jobs or Bill Gates around.
''Economies are big things, governments have trouble changing things, and state governments, in particular, have limits,'' said Joseph Foudy, a professor at New York University's Stern School of Business. ''This is not like Spartanburg, S.C., getting BMW, where you're talking thousands of automobile workers and thousands at suppliers nearby. Something like this can have effects around the margins, but it's not like we have a list of here's how you create jobs.''
Still, said David Skorton, president of Cornell University and co-chairman of the Southern Tier council, if ever there were a time to try something new, this is it.
''It's easy to be skeptical of any strategy or tactic for producing jobs and sustainable economic development when we're all caught in this prolonged downturn with high unemployment and uncertain prospects,'' he said. ''I have no proof this will work, but it would be irresponsible beyond description not to try every way we can to think collectively about how to create and sustain jobs.''

HEADLINE: Iraq Criticizes Exxon Mobil for Its Deal With the Kurds

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER

 BODY:
BAGHDAD -- A deputy prime minister overseeing Iraq's oil industry criticized Exxon Mobil on Sunday over its effort to expand into the semiautonomous Kurdish region in the country's north.
The statement from the official, Hussein al-Shahristani, said the central government had cautioned Exxon against pursuing oil deals in Kurdistan. The government considers such agreements to be illegal until long-awaited rules can be worked that would divide revenues among Iraq's fractious regions.
Mr. Shahristani's office issued its statement after Exxon, whose headquarters are in Irving, Tex., became the first major international oil company to sign a contract in Kurdistan. 
Exxon declined to comment, but officials in Kurdistan confirmed that a contract had been signed on Oct. 18. On Sunday, the regional energy minister, Ashti Hawrami, told reporters at an oil conference in Erbil, the Kurdish capital, that Exxon had been awarded six exploration blocks.
With the deal, Exxon is wading into a dispute that has dogged Iraq since the American invasion in 2003. Oil is the source of Iraq's wealth, and the American invasion threw control of the country's rich reserves into question, worsening the longstanding enmity between the Kurds and other Iraqis. President George W. Bush's administration considered Iraq's passage of an oil law to split revenues a crucial benchmark to long-term peace.
The legal argument against any deal remains unsettled. Iraq's Constitution allows regions to strike their own oil deals, but the central government says there is no law that spells out how that can happen.
Many smaller oil companies, including American producers like Marathon and Hunt, have signed contracts with the Kurdistan regional government. But the larger companies had held back to ensure that they retain deals in the south.
Michael Klare, a professor at Hampshire College and an authority on the Iraqi oil industry, speculated that Exxon might be betting that Iraq would not follow through on its threats of punishment, recognizing that the company's investment elsewhere was critical to the country's economic revival.
''Both Exxon and the Iraqis understand that Iraq has no hope of reaching its lofty goals of higher oil output without Exxon's involvement,'' Professor Klare said. ''Threats to punish the company for investing in the Kurdish area are hollow.''
Critics said oil companies that made deals with Kurdistan after the overthrow of Saddam Hussein's government were pursuing development in a manner that heightened ethnic tensions between Arabs and Kurds and had done little to contribute to economic stability.
For now, at least, the Iraqi government appears to be taking a strongly worded stance whose details are somewhat vague. ''The Iraqi government will deal with any company that violates the law the same way it dealt with similar companies before,'' Mr. Shahristani's statement said on Saturday.
In the past, the government has excluded oil companies active in Kurdistan from new auctions elsewhere. It was unclear whether the statement implied any threat to revoke Exxon's existing contracts, which would be significant. A spokesman for Mr. Shahristani declined to elaborate.
Beyond the ripples that oil deals send through Iraqi's fragile politics, they are important for bringing oil to world markets, but only if relations between the oil companies and the government are smooth enough to allow investment.
The State Department and the military have sought to tamp down antagonism between Kurdistan and the central government for years, and American troops have died trying to keep the peace along that internal border. With the American withdrawal imminent, concerns are mounting that ethnic tensions could again threaten stability.
Under a 2009 contract, Exxon is leading a consortium developing one of Iraq's largest oil fields outside Basra near the Persian Gulf.
Under that agreement, Exxon and its partners agreed to invest $50 billion over seven years to increase output by about two million barrels of oil a day there, at West Qurna Phase 1, bringing more oil to the market than the United States now produces in the Gulf of Mexico. Margins, though, are low. Kurdistan, however, offered more lucrative production-sharing agreements, allowing the company to earn a larger share of revenues and to count more of the crude on its books, which helps lift share prices.

HEADLINE: 'Oops' Moment Takes On A Life of Its Own

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
http://www.hulu.com/watch/299649/saturday-night-live-cold-opening-gop-debate-3
ROCHESTER, Mich. - I knew our CNBC presidential debate had broken through when my daughter called from college to shout: ''Dad, you're on my two favorite Web sites!''
She was talking about CollegeHumor.com and PerezHilton.com, two among the scores of outlets that replayed my exchange with Gov. Rick Perry of Texas that ended with ''Oops.'' It continued through ''Saturday Night Live,'' with Fred Armisen and Nasim Pedrad playing me and my moderating partner, Maria Bartiromo. 
We hardly anticipated slapstick to result from our visit to ''Tension City,'' the PBS anchor Jim Lehrer's term for the experience of moderating presidential debates. Discussions of taxes, deficits and Federal Reserve interest rate policy rarely end that way.
We definitely didn't expect a moment that would ripple across the Internet as one of the biggest debating calamities ever to befall a presidential contender.
But surprise is inherent in these unscripted, high-stakes events. And this one posed especially unpredictable complications.
Start with eight Republican candidates, with varying motivations, depending on their ranking in the 2012 campaign.
Add six questioners from CNBC. Each of us - by virtue of our backgrounds covering politics, business and markets in Washington, New York and Chicago - brought different perspectives.
Then mix in the pressures of live television, and the result was something that no amount of planning could have prepared us for.
As it happened, Maria and I nearly missed the moment that unfolded after Mr. Perry got lost in his stump speech. Only the sharp instincts of a colleague who never appeared on camera ensured that we didn't.
Focus on Economy
Our planning meetings began in earnest two months ago. CNBC producers assembled a thick notebook of economic data and information about the candidates.
Most debate topics were obvious, even if we didn't know how they would translate into questions from us. The entire campaign has revolved around how to generate economic growth, adjust tax and spending levels, and stimulate new hiring.
New topics surfaced as debate night approached. Some, like the deepening European debt crisis, matched our objective of focusing on economic issues.
Others, like the disclosure of sexual harassment accusations against Herman Cain, did not. But the issue had garnered so much attention that it was impossible to avoid.
Soon after the debate began last Wednesday at 8 p.m., we confronted one variable that was completely out of our control: the willingness of the candidates to challenge one another, or not.
When Mr. Perry declined my invitation to critique the leadership of Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, it was clear he wouldn't repeat his aggressive tack from the previous debate. No one else did, either.
Indeed, most of the aggression inside Oakland University's Athletics Center O'rena was directed at us. Audience members booed when we raised the Cain controversy.
We expected that, since Maria and I had received the same reaction at a breakfast of Michigan Republicans that morning. Nor was it surprising when former Speaker Newt Gingrich followed his pattern of attacking debate moderators rather than rival candidates.
What did surprise us was when Mr. Perry's emphatic speech about budget cutting suddenly ran into a synaptic wall.
'Let's See ... '
''It's three agencies of government when I get there that are gone,'' Mr. Perry declared. ''Commerce, Education and the, uh, what's the third one there, let's see ...''
As he scoured his memory, awkwardness drifted into levity. Mr. Perry smiled; I chuckled along with the audience. When Mr. Romney helpfully offered, ''E.P.A.?'' Mr. Perry repeated it with a joshing wave of his hand.
Since our tasks as moderators included keeping the conversation moving, Maria began asking a new question. But our senior producer, who communicated with us throughout the debate through our earpieces, recognized the moment faster than we did.
''DON'T STOP!'' the producer, Sandy Cannold, called out.
So I asked whether the Environmental Protection Agency was in fact the third department on Mr. Perry's list. He acknowledged that it wasn't. When I offered him another chance, Mr. Perry glanced at notes but couldn't find the answer (the Department of Energy).
The rest of the debate flew by. No one doubted the headline - especially not Mr. Perry, who entered the post-debate ''spin room'' to begin an extended effort to defuse his 53-second gaffe with self-deprecating humor.
Then the grousing came. A woman I dated 30 years ago, whose Facebook profile photo is a snapshot of her with Mr. Cain, sent me a ''shame on you'' message for raising the harassment accusations.
We had promised the candidates fairness rather than equal time, but those who felt neglected weren't happy. Mr. Santorum, with 5 minutes and 28 seconds of airtime, was on the screen roughly half the time that Mr. Romney was.
Most surprising was the displeasure voiced from a campaign that emerged unscathed. Even as Mr. Perry's misfortune moved Mr. Romney another step closer to the Republican nomination, his aides complained vehemently that my questions were, um ... what's the word?
Oh yeah - unfair.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Austerity Then And Now

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Not the same, at all. 

 BODY:
Alan Cowell has an interesting piece contrasting public attitudes toward austerity now with attitudes toward the austerity that was the norm in postwar Britain -- and beautifully described by the late Tony Judt. As he notes, one major difference is that back then the sacrifice was shared.
But there are some other differences, arguably even more crucial.
First, here's a little chart from a useful summary of British historical statistics (pdf): 
Postwar Britain had rationing; material consumption was depressed; but it had full employment. This is enormously important. All the evidence I've seen says that the psychological cost of unemployment is much greater than the loss of income. (And I know people who are comfortably fixed for money, but deeply depressed over their inability to find a job.) That's why it's so dumb to say, as some do, that things aren't so bad in America right now because per capita consumption is still high by historical standards.
Second, postwar austerity in Britain was driven by real, obvious limits on resources. In particular, foreign exchange was in short supply. At a basic level, people knew why things were rationed -- Britain had spent heavily on the war, it had to scrimp to pay its bills.
Today, by contrast, austerity is being imposed because men in suits say that it's necessary to satisfy the invisible gods of the financial market. It's understandable that the public is beginning to have its doubts, and not just because those invisible gods somehow demand sacrifices only from workers, never from the wealthy. For the fact is that those men in suits have no idea what they're doing -- a fact that was apparent to some of us early on, but it now becoming common knowledge.
And so if you want to contrast the stoicism of the postwar populace with the anger and confusion of today's voters, don't blame consumerism; blame our leaders, who have imposed gratuitous, unfair pain on their constituents, who are finally starting to figure it out.

BYLINE: GENE MARKS


HIGHLIGHT: Plus: How important are inspiration and creativity to your business? 

 BODY:
What's affecting me, my clients and other small-business owners this week.
The Economy: Can Aliens Save Us?
Small business optimism improves (pdf) a little, but another report finds most small companies think we're already in or likely to enter another recession. One reason: we're having a hard time raising prices. Paul Krugman has an idea: improve the economy by creating the threat of a fake alien invasion. Barry Ritholtz thinks we should just do what Iceland did and let the banks fail: "Rather than bail out the banks - Iceland could not have done so even if they wanted to - they guaranteed deposits (the way our F.D.I.C. does), and let the normal capitalistic process of failure run its course. They are now much, much better for it than the countries like the U.S. and Ireland who did not." Jess Bachman updates his awesome graphic on the government budget. Ben S. Bernanke calls for a heightened focus on small business. Builder Magazine lists the healthiest housing markets. Our trade deficit (pdf) decreases.
Your People: A $50,000 Bonus for Loyalty
Job openings increased, weekly unemployment claims are down, but 99 of our top 100 markets have lost manufacturing jobs. U.P.S. plans to hire 55,000 holiday workers. Adobe cuts 750 jobs. But the State of SMB IT Report says that information technology companies are hiring! Democrats try a new jobs plan. Seventy students walk out of a Harvard class, claiming "the professor's teachings have driven the inequalities in today's society." A frustrated Cleveland Browns fan screams at the stadium. One small-business owner is offering a $50,000 bonus to full-time employees who stay with his company for five years. Suzanne Kearns suggests three ways to give employees year-end bonuses. A surfer is almost swallowed by a whale.
Technology: Dial-Up Service?
Anne Perez gives tips for getting Web sites mobile ready. Yammer makes an acquisition that is "the digital equivalent of the Louisiana Purchase." Guy Kawasaki, Chris Brogan, Ramon Ray and Scott Belsky discuss trends in technology for small businesses. A mobile app rewards kids for keeping parents updated. Robert Scoble profiles two companies that are changing the world of software development. Chad White predicts that the mobile Web will kill mobile apps: "Mobile apps exist because the mobile Web stinks. But it's stinking less and less every day." AOL reports that 200,000 people registeredfor its dial-up service last year. And the Internet actually crashed for 10 seconds.
Start-Up: Now Is the Time
A new report finds that one in four Americans between the ages 44 and 70 are interested in starting a business or nonprofit venture in the next five to 10 years. Semil Shah warns us that clawbacks and start-ups don't mix. Martin Zwilling suggests 10 steps to get that angel investment, and points out, "A conundrum for many frustrated entrepreneurs is that they need money from investors to design and build a prototype product, yet most angel investors expect to see at least a prototype before they invest." Gabriel Weinberg shares the online services his start-up uses. A graphic shows the winners and losers of the 2011 I.P.O. market. American Express opens a $100 million start-up fund. Chris Bibey offers six reasons that now is the time to start your new business, such as: "The only thing you need to get started is an idea, an Internet connection, and a computer. It does not matter where you live as long as you have these three things." Startup Weekend gets support from Google.
Ideas: Jobs Was a Tweaker
Malcolm Gladwell says that Steve Jobs was a "tweaker." Mobile is powering more holiday shopping trips. Wal-Mart's new apps will integrate coupons and voice. An entrepreneur explains how he lost his business at age 11. Retailers are considering Black Thursday? Josh Green is betting on "entrepreneurs in emerging markets, the folks who deeply understand the growing global middle class - because they're a part of it." Geoffrey James lists five ways big companies hurt their small vendors. One in 10 American adults visits magazine-branded social sites. Rod Kurtz explains how to make money on Twitter. A surfer rides a 90-foot wave.
Here and There: Defying the Mob
Power failures hit many Northeast businesses. A small Washington State winery comes of age. Mathew Keegan explains how to avoid exorbitantly high holiday airfares. Here are the airports with the worst on-time performance. The Flyers send the National Hockey League a message. Snooki introduces a new perfume. Bruce Springsteen does "Incident on 57th Street" solo. Oakland business owners feel they may not recover from the Occupy protest. But most small-business owners are split on the Occupiers' cause. The Loch Ness monster is finally caught on tape (in Canada). A bunch of elderly Chinese cover Lady Gaga. An Italian entrepreneur defies mobsters with tuna and ice cream. This is the strongest girl I've ever seen.
Marketing 1: The 10 Commandments
An analysis finds that online retail spending reached $36.3 billion for the third quarter, up 13 percent from a year ago. Jill Krasny gives five reasons to skip the Black Friday madness and shop Small Business Saturday instead. Sherice Jacob preaches her 10 commandments for creating a lead-generating Web site, such as, "Using action-oriented words in your offer places the customer in a pivotal role as the one receiving the benefits as opposed to simply imagining them." Eric Markowitz suggests employing the five senses to encourage customers to buy. Heidi Cohen explains what consumers really want.
Marketing 2: Is Google+ Dead?
A few experts explain how to handle negative online reviews. Flexible queuing systems are shown to improve customer service. A "State of the Blogosphere" report says that corporate bloggers make up 8 percent of the blogosphere and entrepreneurs make up 13 percent. Orna Ross explains why bloggers should meditate. An entomophagy expert makes a case for eating insects. Google wants us to use Google+ to get closer to our customers, but Farhad Manjoo says that Google+ is already dead: "Traffic-analysis firms have reported that Google+'s traffic has fallen precipitously from its early peak. Even Google's own executives seem to have gotten bored by the site."
Red Tape Update: Congressman Hunter Gets My Vote
Are federal workers underpaid compared to their private sector counterparts? President Obama takes aim at federal worker swag. In this video, an accountant discusses the differences between forming a limited liability company, a C corporation and an S corporation. Fewer small businesses than expected have claimed the health care tax credit. A Texas scientist creates the threads for an invisibility cloak. In a new bookBill Clinton explains why we need smart government. The Christmas tree industry gets permission to tax itself but the Obama administration retracts it. Robert Wood asks: is Occupy Wall Street (and other "charities" like it) tax deductible? Representative Duncan D. Hunter says that small businesses should be paying no taxes, period. Small businesses tell lawmakers to revamp the tax code. Wal-Mart plans to enter the health care market.
The Week Ahead: Leadership Challenges
This week we get updated numbers on retail sales, producer and consumer prices and building permits. The Philadelphia Fed will report on its region. If you're in Washington, D.C., for this week's Global Entrepreneurship Week, stop by the House Committee on Small Business's hearing on "Protecting Small Business Contracting: Leadership Challenges at the Department of the Treasury."
The Week's Bests
Five Terms To Make a Marketer's Brain Hurt. Lisa Arthur shares the five terms, including integration: "At most companies, marketing represents the single largest variable spend, but unless you're using an integrated marketing management approach, you can't measure where the value really is, and you can't keep marketing activities properly aligned with organizational strategy. Today's forward-thinking marketers realize that integration is not just the key to success; these days, it's the key to survival."
Example of a Great Brand. Timothy Fariss explains that Nike is not a shoe company: "Watch a Nike commercial lately? Not as much focus on the product as the ethos of 'victory and winning' right? This is because Nike has invested in building a brand to the extent that they don't even have to tell you what the 'it' is in 'just do it' Over the years, Nike has branded so well they have completely dropped the 'just do it' tagline - the swoosh logo is now enough to instill in consumers the sum total of the Nike brand ethos. If you believe in victory and winning, there's a great chance Nike can sell you more than just shoes."
How Inspiration Breeds Creativity. Scott Barry Kaufman explains: "Inspired people view themselves as more creative and show actual increases in self-ratings of creativity over time. Patent-holding inventors report being inspired more frequently and intensely than non-patent holders, and the higher the frequency of inspiration, the higher the number of patents held. ... The link between inspiration and creativity is consistent with the transcendent aspect of inspiration, since creativity involves seeing possibility beyond existing constraints."

HEADLINE: Do You Shop at Locally Owned Businesses?

BYLINE: SHANNON DOYNE


HIGHLIGHT: Does your community have locally owned businesses that compete with big box retailers? 

 BODY:
In "Buying Underwear, Along With the Whole Store," Amy Cortese reports on an upstate New York town whose people banded together to open a community-owned store as an alternative to traveling 50 miles to the nearest shopping center:
SARANAC LAKE, N.Y.-- The residents of Saranac Lake, a picturesque town in the Adirondacks, are a hardy lot - they have to be to withstand winter temperatures that can drop to 30 below zero. But since the local Ames department store went out of business in 2002 - a victim of its corporate parent's bankruptcy - residents have had to drive to Plattsburgh, 50 miles away, to buy basics like underwear or bed linens. And that was simply too much.
So when Wal-Mart Stores came knocking, some here welcomed it. Others felt that the company's plan to build a 120,000-square-foot supercenter would overwhelm their village, with its year-round population of 5,000, and put local merchants out of business.
It's a situation familiar to many communities these days. But rather than accept their fate, residents of Saranac Lake did something unusual: they decided to raise capital to open their own department store. Shares in the store, priced at $100 each, were marketed to local residents as a way to "take control of our future and help our community," said Melinda Little, a Saranac Lake resident who has been involved in the effort from the start. "The idea was, this is an investment in the community as well as the store."
... "It's been a long process for all of us. We're very proud to have it finally become a reality," Ms. Brown said. Her husband, a vigorous-looking man who had a neatly trimmed white beard and was wearing a cowboy hat, added, "This is a small town trying to help itself."
Think of it as the retail equivalent of the Green Bay Packers - a department store owned by its customers that will not pick up and leave when a better opportunity comes along or a corporate parent takes on too much debt.
... "There is definitely a trend towards community-rooted alternatives," said Stacy Mitchell, a senior researcher at the Institute for Local Self Reliance, a nonprofit research and educational organization. Citing the Occupy Wall Street protests and Move Your Money campaigns, she said, "More people are interested in taking the economy back."
Cooperatives - nonprofit businesses like food stores and credit unions owned by and run on behalf of their members - are one common manifestation of the trend. In a co-op, each member gets one vote, and excess revenue not reinvested in the business is distributed among members either as rebates or, in the case of credit unions, lower fees and better interest rates. In the United States, a University of Wisconsin study estimated, there are more than 29,000 co-ops generating $654 billion in revenue, and the number is growing.
Community-owned stores are not as well known and are structured as profit-making corporations, but the aim is the same: to keep ownership and control in the community, and to share the prosperity.
Students: Tell us what you think about the idea of community-owned stores and co-ops. Do you think locally owned businesses are more committed to their communities? Why or why not? What are the trade-offs in shopping at locally owned stores versus shopping centers that have the same large stores that are found throughout the country? Do you have a personal philosophy when it comes to deciding where to shop?

HEADLINE: Consumer Reports Poll Shows Support for Stronger Fuel-Economy Standards

BYLINE: CHERYL JENSEN


HIGHLIGHT: Results from the telephone survey indicated near-unanimous approval of stricter legislation and wide interest in alternative-power vehicles. 

 BODY:
A poll conducted by Consumer Reports in late October showed that an overwhelming majority of American consumers would support higher fuel-economy standards and would be willing to pay a premium for high-efficiency vehicles.
Nearly all, or 93 percent, of the 1,008 people interviewed supported an increase in fuel efficiency. Seventy-seven percent agreed that automakers should produce more fuel-efficient vehicles and that the government should increase standards and enforce them.
Meanwhile, 81 percent of respondents said they were willing to pay more for a fuel-efficient vehicle if it would lower their operating costs.
The telephone survey of a nationally representative probability sample of households, with a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points, was administered by the Consumer Reports National Research Center.
For consumers who had at least one car, 79 percent said their chief concern was the price of gasoline, closely followed by their concern over American reliance on foreign oil.
Over half of respondents, or 56 percent, said they would consider alternative-power vehicles like hybrids or electric cars as their next vehicle, with hybrids like the Toyota Prius being the most common type being considered, at 41 percent.
Lower costs were cited by 89 percent of consumers as their primary motivation for considering these vehicles. Eighty percent agreed that consumers should receive incentives in the form of rebates or tax credits to buy fuel-efficient or alternative-fuel vehicles.
Also, 80 percent agreed that fuel-economy standards should require automakers to increase the overall fleet average to at least 55 miles per gallon by 2025. This response shows strong support for the target fuel-economy standards announced by the White House in July, according to Consumer Reports.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Environmental Protection Agencyare expected this week to announce details of the proposed Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE, standards, and issue a notice of proposed rule-making.

HEADLINE: What Percentage Lives in Poverty?

BYLINE: NANCY FOLBRE


HIGHLIGHT: Improving Americans' standard of living across different income groups is a political difficulty underlying the debate about measures of poverty, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Do poor people represent the bottom 16 percent of the population or the bottom 15 percent? The answer matters more than you might think.
The difficulty of measuring economic well-being helps explain why it's hard for people to figure out what economic percentile they belong to or which public policies would best serve their interests.
A difference of one percentage point in the overall poverty rate is no big deal. But the new Supplemental Poverty Measure, or S.P.M., developed by the Census Bureau, which yields the slightly higher overall estimate, shows lower rates of poverty among children and higher rates among the elderly than the traditional measure. An estimate based on a measure similar to the S.P.M. suggests that poverty has increased less over time.
The S.P.M. goes beyond consideration of money income to estimate the value of such in-kind transfers as food stamps, net taxes paid to government (taxes paid less the value of tax credits received), and medical and work-related expenses (such as child care and commuting costs). It also employs a new standard of need, linked to what low-income families actually spend.

Children are the beneficiaries of more of the in-kind transfers measured by the S.P.M. than people over age 65 and have fewer out-of-pocket medical expenses. As a result, they look less susceptible to poverty under the new measure than the traditional one, especially compared with older adults. Safety net programs such as food stamps expanded during the Great Recession.
Any income-based measure that takes such transfers into account is likely to show a smaller increase in poverty resulting from the recession than one that does not. Indeed, a good measure of poverty should register the impact of major public policies.
Unfortunately, the S.P.M. suffers some painful limitations. Like the traditional poverty measure, it understates the relative economic well-being of older adults because it ignores the value of their wealth - which doesn't count as income although it can reduce or help cover their living expenses.
Also, some low-income families simply can't afford expenditures on health and go untreated. They are not necessarily better off than similar families who spend money on health, though the S.P.M. might make them appear so.
Shawn Fremstad of the Center for Economic and Policy Priorities effectively details these shortcomings. But like others who acknowledge the S.P.M.'s limitations, including Arloc Sherman of the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities and Heidi Hartmann of the Institute for Women's Policy Research, he agrees that it provides important new information.
Much depends on how researchers, journalists and public policy makers interpret the measure and how they explain the difficulties of measuring economic well-being.
The in-kind benefits that people receive from government go far beyond those measured in the S.P.M. and include big-ticket items such as spending on public education and Medicare expenditures. Tax benefits range from implicit tax subsidies for employer-provided health insurance to the mortgage-interest tax deduction.
The value of these benefits to individual families is not measured in any comprehensive survey. Both in-kind and tax benefits to the poor are more politically visible, and they phase out rapidly as family income increases above the poverty line, where both federal income and Social Security taxes begin to bite harder.
This differential visibility probably intensifies political resentments that some middle-income working families feel toward the poor.
Yet taking net taxes and work-related expenditures into account shows many families closer to the poverty line than they would otherwise seem. Using the traditional income-based measure, about 36 percent of Americans lived in families with income more than four times the poverty level in 2010. Using the S.P.M. measure of economic well-being, the size of that top group declines to 17 percent.
Major government transfers and benefits are directed at different age groups. As a result, age-based politics now greatly complicates political alignments based on class. Most individuals enjoy large transfers from the government as children (through public education) and as retirees (Social Security and Medicare) paying net taxes only as working-age adults. As a result, voters are often confronted by choices that might help them now but hurt them later, benefit their children or harm their parents.
We are now a demographically diverse population with enormous variation across households in the extent of time devoted to the care of dependents, whether children, individuals with health or disability problems, or the frail elderly. Yet we don't factor either the costs or the benefits of this work time into estimates of family living standards.
When differences across income groups are extreme and increasing over time -- as between the bottom 99 percent and the top 1 percent - they can trump these complexities.
But any political movement that aims to unify American voters must devise strategies to improve their standard of living. Such strategies should be informed by serious efforts to go beyond conventional measures of family income to develop more comprehensive measures of economic well-being.

HEADLINE: The Euro Zone Crisis and the U.S.: A Primer

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: There are three main channels through which the fiasco across the pond could hurt the United States: trade, stock markets and (most worrisome) a contagious credit crisis. Here's a quick look at each. 

 BODY:
The potential effect of the euro zone crisis on the United States has been the subject of several recentarticles, including Annie Lowrey's on Saturday. Here's a primer summarizing the three main channels through which the fiasco across the Atlantic could hurt the American economy: trade, stock markets and (most worrisome) a contagious credit crisis.
1) Trade. There are two ways that a European catastrophe could hurt American exports.
First, it could shrink our customer base in Europe. Europe buys 22 percent of our exports, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. If Greece and other countries implode, causing a severe recession in Europe, orders for American products and services would fall.
Second, the crisis could shrink the United States customer base around the world. As investors become more concerned about the stability of the euro zone, they will stop investing in the euro. When there is less demand for euros, the value of the euro gets cheaper. By comparison, the dollar gets more expensive. That makes American-made products more expensive, so American products become less attractive to customers worldwide.
2) The stock market. European stock markets and American stock markets are strongly correlated, as shown by indices for both in the chart below:
Of course, this chart doesn't show what's cause and what's effect. A statistical analysis by economists at Deutsche Bank, however, has found that American markets seemed to drive European markets from the onset of the financial crisis in 2007 to March 2010, and since then the reverse has been true: movements in the European markets seemed to be leading movements in American ones.
Additionally, many American companies depend on revenue from Europe, as you might have guessed from the export numbers noted above. Deutsche Bank analysts estimate that about 15 to 20 percent of corporate revenues of companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index are generated by Europe. For companies in the materials, energy and tech sectors, the share earned in Europe is even higher.
When these companies do badly, and their shares drop, the pain is felt much more broadly in the United States. Declines in the stock market mean less valuable portfolios for Americans across the country, causing consumers to feel poorer and be less willing to spend money.
This is known as the wealth effect. We saw it when housing values first plunged, leading Americans to realize they weren't as rich as they thought they were.
3) Debt exposure and a contagious credit crisis. This is the biggest worry, since global financial markets are deeply interconnected.
Europeans owe lots of money to one another -- and to other countries -- as you can see in this debt graphic. For example, American banks own a lot of French debt, and French banks own a lot of Italian debt. If Italy defaults, French banks are in trouble. If those French banks then default, American banks are likewise compromised. With these banks insolvent (or at the very least illiquid), it becomes harder for American companies and consumers to borrow.
The contagion can also spread rapidly because once one country falls, investors get antsy about the fate of their investments in similarly indebted countries. So investors start selling off those assets en masse too, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy and causing those countries to implode. And so the domino effect continues.
Even just worrying about these types of scenarios can seriously damage financial markets, because people stop lending if they suspect someone major somewhere won't be able to pay the debt back. Already banks are tightening their lending standards for borrowers who have significant exposure to Europe, according to the Federal Reserve's latest Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices.
Part of the reason the global Great Recession began (and was so devastating) was that healthy credit markets are crucial to the functioning of any economy. If there is a broad tightening of credit, economic activity seizes up as well.

HEADLINE: Long Road Ahead for Most American States

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: A look at how long it'll take for each state to recover the jobs lost during the recession. 

 BODY:
Michigan, Nevada and Rhode Island will probably have to wait another six years before they are back to the number of jobs they had before the recession struck, according to economists at IHS Global Insight.
These analysts have projected when each state will likely return to its past peak employment, as shown in the map below:
Across the country, there are 4.7 percent fewer jobs today than there were when the recession began in December 2007. And remember that the United States population has grown in the last five years, so if the economy were healthy there would be jobs today than there were then. This analysis only models when we'll be back to square one.
Only Alaska, North Dakota and the District of Columbia have recovered the jobs they lost during the recession. Those places have actually surpassed their previous employment peaks as well.

HEADLINE: Affiliation, Before and After Scandal

BYLINE: MOTOKO RICH


HIGHLIGHT: A new study looks at the effect of sex abuse scandals on the number of Catholics in the United States. 

 BODY:
In the wake of the sexual abuse scandal that is roiling Penn State's football program, some are wondering whether there could be long-term effects on recruiting, donations and the long-term reputation of the university.
Many experts in higher education who have seen other universities weather crises expect the impact of the events at Penn State to fade within a year. But another precedent for how people might react is the aftermath of the sexual abuse scandals that rocked the Roman Catholic Church in the last decade.
A survey by the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life conducted in 2008 found that Americans who had left Catholicism had done so for many reasons, including unhappiness with the church's position on abortion or homosexuality, disagreement with teachings on birth control, and the feeling that their spiritual needs were not being met. But the survey also found that about a quarter of those saying they had abandoned Catholicism cited sexual abuse by members of the clergy as a reason for either leaving religion altogether or affiliating with a different denomination.
A new study by Daniel M. Hungerman, an economist at the University of Notre Dame, estimates that the Catholic Church in the United States lost about two million members - or 3 percent of its American membership - because of the sexual abuse scandals, and that donations to other religious groups rose by $3 billion in the five years after the first significant news reports of the abuses.

Using data from the Official Catholic Directory, the General Social Survey (which is conducted by the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago), the Pew Forum and the Southern Baptist Convention, Mr. Hungerman concludes that disaffected Catholics who have cited the abuse scandals as a primary reason for leaving the church have joined denominations that - unlike, say, the Episcopal Church - are not necessarily very similar to Catholicism.
In fact, Mr. Hungerman's analysis concludes that Southern Baptists, as well as other denominations quite different from Catholicism, have gained a notable number of new members who fled the Catholic Church. "It could be that Catholics came to associate the scandal with some constellation of attributes provided by the Catholic Church, and so defecting Catholics sought out groups with entirely different attributes," Mr. Hungerman wrote.
The Pew Forum data cited by Mr. Hungerman showed that of those who left Catholicism because of the abuse scandals, 6 percent converted to a Baptist church and 17 percent converted to "other Christian" churches, defined as separate from the "mainline" Protestant denominations like the Methodists, Lutherans and Presbyterians, which drew 8 percent of those Catholics disaffected by the scandals. Only 2 percent joined Episcopalian congregations.
Of course, Catholics may have joined another denomination for entirely different reasons. Instead of making a protest decision, they may simply have changed churches because of geography, the influence of friends, availability of children's programs and other pastoral services and the atmosphere in a particular community. 
In fact, the largest group of people who left Catholicism as a result of the scandals were the 51 percent who were "unaffiliated" with any religion, according to the Pew data. That is very similar to the 54 percent of lapsed Catholics who became unaffiliated simply because they had "drifted away" from their faith.

HEADLINE: Opinion Report: Civil Rights in Alabama

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: A summary of what's on today's editorial page. 

 BODY:
There's a new civil rights struggle in Alabama, this time against anti-immigrant laws that deny those without papers the ability to work or travel, to own or rent a home, or to enter contracts of any kind.
New York City routinely fails to release data requested under the state's Freedom of Information Law. Mayor Michael Bloomberg should tell his administrators to comply quickly and thoroughly.
Some Republicans are finally standing up against Grover Norquist's anti-tax pledge. Recently, 40 Republicans and 60 Democrats sent a letter to the budget deficit supercommittee urging a grand bargain that includes new revenues as well as spending cuts.
A new report from the U.S. Sentencing Commission has found that federal mandatory minimum sentences are often severe and applied inconsistently, contributing to the near tripling of federal prisoners in the last 20 years. It's time for Congress to rescind mandatory minimum sentences.

HEADLINE: In a California Vineyard, Bluebirds Earn Their Keep

BYLINE: RACHEL NUWER


HIGHLIGHT: Attracted to nest boxes set up by an ornithologist, birds doubled their numbers in a central California vineyard and consumed enough insects to earn their keep. 

 BODY:
In an innovative study, nest boxes installed at a California vineyard attracted hundreds of birds that picked the farmers' crops clean of pests in exchange for the free housing. The experiment is heartening news for conservationists amid reports of shrinking habitats and population declines for so many species. 
"Placing songbird nesting boxes in agricultural landscapes can provide suitable nesting sites for a lot of birds that used to be plentiful 100 or 200 years ago but lost their natural landscapes," said Julie Jedlicka, an ornithologist at the University of California, Berkeley. 
Dr. Jedlicka set out to study whether installing the nest boxes would help attract the birds and reduce pests. Her research, published last week in the journal PLoS One, confirmed her hunch. Compared with control areas in the same vineyard that did not have the nest boxes, areas with the boxes attracted twice as many birds early in the nesting season and had 2.6 times as many birds later in the breeding season. 
Western bluebirds were responsible for much of the increase: 313 of them were counted at the nest box sites, versus 39 in control portions of the vineyard.

Over all, 1,122 birds representing 25 species made an appearance. Both the nest box sites and the sites without boxes had about the same number of species present, but the numbers of insect-eating species was 50 percent greater in areas with the nest boxes. Insectivorous birds removed about 2.4 times as many insect larvae at the nest box sites as they did in the control areas. 
Dr. Jedlicka's idea is not new. From 1885 to 1940, the federal Department of Agriculture devoted resources to studying "economic ornithology," or using birds as biological controls for agricultural pests. After pesticides like DDT were developed during World War II, that approach largely faded in favor of a quick chemical fix. Now Dr. Jedlicka envisions a revival of economic ornithology through the lens of ecosystem services and bird conservation. 
As cavity-nesting songbirds, bluebirds are particularly well suited to the task. Although they look for enclosures to build their nests, they tend to prefer those found within otherwise open spaces, and agricultural fields fit the bill. What is more, "they respond rapidly to new nesting opportunities," Dr. Jedlicka said. Within one year of placing about 100 nest boxes in two vineyard study sites, bluebird families occupied over 75 percent of the boxes, she said. 
Bluebirds are not picky about what they eat: caterpillars, beetles, and grasshoppers are all fair game. A bluebird family of five nestlings requires 125 grams of arthropods per day, and bluebird pairs can produce two broods per year. 
The birds probably won't replace farm pesticide use entirely. Some pests, like spider mites, are too small for bluebirds to consume.
Dr. Jedlicka hopes that wineries will gradually adopt the "Bird Friendly" stamp, a certification already widely available for coffee growers. Vintners could then market their products to the growing eco-friendly consumer sector while helping the birds. 
Wine growers aren't the only farmers who can benefit: the combined range of North America's three bluebird species extends across the United States. Farmers in Florida already use nest boxes to attract insect-eating birds, as do some apple orchard managers in New England. 
Nest boxes can be used to attract bluebirds to urban gardens as well. "I imagine it would be difficult to find an agricultural system where this wouldn't work," Dr. Jedlicka said.

HEADLINE: Flying on Chicken Fat

BYLINE: MATTHEW L. WALD


HIGHLIGHT: To shield themselves from oil price gyrations, airlines are experimenting with fuels that incorporate ingredients like used fryer oil and algae. 

 BODY:
 Gasoline for cars is commonly blended with corn ethanol. In the last few weeks, airlines have started using blends, too, but their feedstocks are more varied, including chicken fat, algal oil, used fryer grease and parts of inedible plants. 
 Last week, Alaska Airlines, based in Seattle, began one of the most ambitious to date, a series of 75 flights that will burn a total of 15,000 gallons of an 80/20 blend with ordinary jet fuel. The supplier,Dynamic Fuels of Geismar, La., says it can make the fuel from a wide range of organic substances, including used fryer oil. Tyson, the chicken company, is a partner, providing chicken fat and beef tallow. 
Alaska is using the fuel in a daily flight of a Boeing 737 from Seattle to Reagan National Airport in Washington and three daily flights in a Q400 turboprop.between Seattle and Portland, Ore. United Airlines also made a last from Chicago to Houston for which 40 percent of the fuel was derived from algae. 
None of these fuels is quite ready for prime time. Alaska paid $17 a gallon for the blend, whereas conventional jet fuel costs a little over $3. It's like using kobe beef to stretch supplies of Hamburger Helper.
But the price will come down, said Robert M. Ames, an executive at Dynamic Fuels. "Like a lot of things, the first units you produce seem to be a bit more expensive than the millionth or billionth," he said.

The 15,000 gallons is little more than a drop in the bucket: the 737 that Alaska flies to Washington will burn more almost 900 gallons of fuel per hour in the air.
"Obviously, we didn't do this because in the short run it was an economically rational thing to do,'' said Keith Loveless, the airline's general counsel. "But our view is you have to start somewhere." 
The airlines say they are determined to nurture new technologies that will free them from the gyrations of the world oil market. This could take a while. Ethanol is now plentiful, but not nearly as abundant as gasoline, and its price tends to swing up and down with the price of the gasoline it substitutes for. 
The alternative is for the airlines to sign cost-plus contracts and hope that the costs of biofuels stay below the cost of conventional fuel. That depends heavily on the price of a barrel of oil.
Unlike ethanol in cars, the new fuels for planes are "drop-in," meaning they are chemically identical to jet fuel and no modifications are needed for the planes themselves. That is critical in aviation; one of the essential qualities of jet fuel is its "gel point," the temperature at which it is so cold that it starts to congeal and does not flow smoothly to the engines. 
Dynamic says it starts with natural molecules that have hydrogen, carbon and oxygen. It adds hydrogen, which bonds with the oxygen to form water, and the water is taken out of the mixture. It adds more hydrogen to get the carbon/hydrogen balance right, forming molecules in branch shapes that will keep the fuel liquid at low temperatures. 
The specifications for diesel fuel, which can be made from the same ingredients, are far less exacting. But bio-jet fuel may be easier to ship to market than biodiesel. A single "fuel farm" at a major airport could fill hundreds of planes a day. Converting about three dozen airports would cover more than half the passenger jet traffic in the United States. 
Many companies are working on supplying such fuel. A Canadian project to make the fuel from forest waste is moving ahead. But it is that appear to be the most interested; KLM, Lufthansa and Finnair are already using such fuels. 
Since European carriers will soon be paying a tax on their carbon dioxide emissions, bio-jet fuel could reduce their tax bills - although probably not enough to make up for bio-jet's higher prices, for now.

HEADLINE: Barclays Capital Rises, 'Big-Boy Checkbook' in Hand

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: Multibillion-dollar deals have been more common for the bank since it stepped up its aggression beginning in 2008. 

 BODY:
The American pipeline operator Kinder Morgan struck one of the biggest deals of the year nearly a month ago with its $21.1 billion purchase of a rival, the El Paso Corporation.
What was just as notable was the financing backing the deal - a $13.3 billion loan package arranged by Barclays Capital, one of the largest financing efforts that the bank had made on its own. It was the second time this year that the British investment bank took the initial financing of a megadeal upon its shoulders. In August, Barclays lent $8.3 billion to Hewlett-Packard to help pay for its $11.7 billion purchase of the British software company Autonomy.
 Those loans are part of Barclays' continued efforts to move into the top ranks of advisers on mergers and acquisitions, a campaign begun when the London bank purchased the bulk of Lehman Brothers' North American investment bank in 2008.
As of last Thursday, Barclays was ranked seventh among worldwide merger advisers, having participated in 148 deals worth more than $290 billion, according to data from Thomson Reuters. That is a step up from the ninth place that the company held in each of the last three years.
And in terms of deal lending, Barclays ranks in the top five this year, with more than $28 billion in syndicated loan proceeds, according to Thomson Reuters.
"We've long had a big-boy M.& A. business," Hugh E. McGee III, Barclays' head of investment banking and a Lehman veteran, said in an interview. "And now we've got a big-boy checkbook."
Yet the company still has a way to go. It trails its more established competitors, including JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America-Merrill Lynch, both in merger advice and in lending.
JPMorgan, for instance, is ranked third in deal advice and second in merger lending. And it still claims the crown for the biggest deal loan since the 2008 financial crisis, having initially shouldered a $20 billion loan to AT&T for its proposed $39 billion takeover of T-Mobile USA, a unit of Deutsche Telekom.
And a lending business does not guarantee a higher spot on the league tables, or rankings. BNP Paribas, for instance, ranks seventh for deal lending this year, but 13th for mergers advice. Goldman Sachs, on the other hand, ranks ninth in lending but leads the mergers league tables.
Mr. McGee concedes that his company still has some work to do. But he added that Barclays had made progress, including building investment banking operations in Europe and in Asia.
That campaign also includes lending to deals by longtime clients, as in the case of Kinder Morgan and H.P.
Barclays began discussions with Kinder Morgan on Sept. 8 about financing the El Paso takeover, several months after Kinder Morgan had begun discussing the deal with the American investment bank Evercore Partners, according to a regulatory filing.
What Barclays ended up providing was a three-part loan package that the bank initially shouldered on its own, though on Oct. 31 it sold pieces of the loan to 10 other banks.
As with the Hewlett-Packard and AT&T single-bank loans, the financing provided some speed and certainty to Kinder Morgan, allowing the company to avoid the normally time-consuming process of finding enough lenders to provide capital. It also helped clamp down on leaks by limiting the number of people with knowledge of the transaction.
While the loan appeared to be a risk - it was not rated investment grade - Barclays executives said they believed in the deal, which would create the biggest American operator of oil and natural gas pipelines. Kinder Morgan, after all, was a longtime client.
Barclays' single-bank loan offerings had some extra benefits for the bank's clients as well. Along with its loan to H.P., Barclays helped the technology giant hedge the currency risk in its Autonomy deal without tipping off others in the market.
Still, to some, Barclays' loans signify an effort to buy a better spot on deal league tables.
And the bank has gotten into some trouble for its lending practices before: last month, the company settled a shareholder lawsuit over the $5 billion takeover of Del Monte Foods, in which Barclays advised the seller. The plaintiffs had argued that Barclays, which advised Del Monte and provided financing to potential buyers, had an incentive to prevent a robust auction of the food company. Barclays ultimately agreed to pay $23.7 million and gave up $21 million in fees.
But Mr. McGee said the bank's aim was not to rely on lending to get into deals. Barclays is less likely to make a giant loan commitment if it is not one of the lead advisers on a transaction, he said, and is being discerning about to whom it lends.
"We want to lead with our relationships and then use our balance sheet," he said. "We don't want to lead with our balance sheet."

HEADLINE: A Famous Neighbor: Is Having One a Good Thing?

BYLINE: MICHAEL KOLOMATSKY


HIGHLIGHT: This week, the Appraisal looks at a house in Mount Kisco, N.Y., that happens to be across the street from Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. 

 BODY:
Even the most hardcore celebrity hound might not be excited to find the paparazzi on the lawn next door. But wouldn't the presence of a famous neighbor bump property values, providing measurable cachet to one's block or building?
That's not entirely clear, as Joseph Berger reports in this week's Appraisal column. A house in Westchester County that happens to be across the street from Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo's residence, has been on the market for more than a year. By all accounts, the governor and his girlfriend, Sandra Lee, the Food Network celebrity chef, are cordial neighbors; their house is far from an eyesore and their bucolic hamlet has the additional lure of a desirable school district. The house for sale is priced at a relatively modest $699,000. 
A celebrity living on your block or in your building might have its benefits. Noting the constant police presence at the governor's house, Sue, a neighbor up the road, said with a laugh,"Nobody's going to rob my house."
Was your real estate hunt affected by the proximity of the famous? Is a celebrity neighbor a good thing or something to be avoided? Who lives near you, and what story can you tell about living in his or her glow?

HEADLINE: Post-Madoff, a Greater Awareness of Ponzi Schemes

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: Federal authorities are opening more investigations of possible fraud, which they attribute to greater awareness among consumers and a weak economy. 

 BODY:
Nearly three years after Bernard L. Madoff's gigantic fraud imploded, federal authorities say they are cracking down on Ponzi schemes in greater numbers.
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission brought 32 enforcement cases against suspected Ponzi schemes in its 2011 fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, a 45 percent increase from 2010 and a record high for the agency, according to data that will be released on Tuesday. In the same period, the Federal Bureau of Investigation opened more than 1,000 inquiries into possible Ponzi schemes, a roughly 150 percent increase from 2008, new figures show.
"Ponzi schemes are one of our top priorities within financial crimes," Timothy A. Gallagher, the F.B.I.'s section chief for financial crimes, said. "It's right up there with corporate fraud and insider trading."
Regulators say their sharpened focus on Ponzi schemes, where firms pay bogus returns to investors using other clients' money, is because of heightened awareness from consumers and the weak state of the economy. Ponzi schemes rely on a steady inflow of fresh money, but when investors withdraw cash en masse, the schemes dry up.
The cases are rarely front-page news, and the architects of the schemes are usually not prominent names like Mr. Madoff's. But after Mr. Madoff's fraud went undetected for decades, which was an embarrassing blow to the Securities and Exchange Commission, regulators have quietly stepped up their scrutiny of small schemes.
Nearly a third of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's enforcement cases in the last year took aim at Ponzi schemes, cases that collectively totaled $279 million. The agency filed or won five cases in the last month alone.
"The data documents that this is a widespread and ever-present problem in America," said Bart Chilton, a Democratic commissioner at the agency. Mr. Chilton recently wrote a book, an educational publication for the agency - "Ponzimonium: How Scam Artists Are Ripping Off America" - to raise awareness about the prevalence of "scamsters," he said. "Consumers need to be on guard more than ever before."
Last week, the agency filed a complaint against two brothers, Rodney Wagner and Roger Wagner, accusing them of using their Dallas church to recruit nearly 100 investors into a $5.5 million foreign exchange fund. The brothers, according to the complaint, boasted an attractive selling point: at least 200 percent returns.
Yet only a fraction of the customer money was actually deposited into trading accounts, and these accounts lost money, the agency said.
A lawyer for the brothers did not return a request for comment.
Regulators and securities lawyers attribute the surge in Ponzi scheme cases to a recent flood of consumer tips. Investors are more attuned to fraudulent funds, the experts say, after the public downfall of Mr. Madoff.
"In light of Madoff, they're sending the tips earlier," said Marc Litt, a lawyer at Baker & McKenzie and a former federal prosecutor who led the case against Mr. Madoff, resulting in a 150-year sentence. "There's heightened scrutiny to these schemes and the damage they cause."

HEADLINE: Behind the Cover Story: Ronen Bergman on the Gilad Shalit Swap

BYLINE: RACHEL NOLAN


HIGHLIGHT: Over the years, I have seen time and time again that Americans are baffled by the attitude of Israeli society, its intelligence community and its military toward hostages, POWs and MIAs in general and by the Gilad Shalit affair in particular. "Why are you making such a big deal out of one kidnapped soldier?" 

 BODY:
Ronen Bergman is a political and military analyst for the Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth and the author of, among other books, "By Any Means Necessary: Israel's Covert War for Its P.O.W.'s and M.I.A.'s." He is currently at work on a history of the Mossad. The story about Israel's exchange of 1,027 prisoners for Gilad Shalit, who was abducted five years ago by Hamas in a firefight on the border of the Gaza Strip, is Ronen's first cover article for the magazine.
Q.
How did you become interested in this story?
A.
Over the years, I have seen time and time again that Americans are baffled by the attitude of Israeli society, its intelligence community and its military toward hostages, P.O.W.'s and M.I.A.'s in general and by the Gilad Shalit affair in particular. "Why are you making such a big deal out of one kidnapped soldier?" is a question that came up frequently both in conversation with senior U.S. officials and when I have lectured in the U.S.
This is not only a matter of America's official policy of not negotiating with terrorist organizations, but also American bewilderment, their raised eyebrows, at what they perceive as the disregard for proportionality in Israel's attitude. Strangely perhaps, it is the dovish element in the United States - including liberal Jews who are harshly critical of the current Israeli administration's policies- that has expressed opposition to the Shalit deal and argued that it reveals a dangerous weakness on the part of Israel.
In my story, I tried to explain how and why the once purely religious precept of redeeming prisoners has become so deeply fixed in Israel's collective consciousness.
Q.
You are an expert in Israeli intelligence. To your knowledge, has Israel ever used a private citizen like Gershon Baskin to negotiate in the past?
A.
It certainly has, for one main reason: The official Israeli stance is that the state will not talk to terrorist organizations. The use of private citizens, usually left-wing activists or lawyers who are given secret authority by the prime minister, makes it possible for the government to maintain loose contacts without drawing too much attention to itself. Because these emissaries, who also tend to have greater freedom of movement, are informal, the government can always deny any official connection to them.
Q.
Baskin is a curious figure in this story. Do you think that if Ehud Olmert had not rebuffed him this deal could have been brokered and Shalit released years earlier? Or are those kinds of counterfactuals tricky, because all kinds of other factors have also shifted in the meantime?
A.
When I was studying for my Ph.D. at Cambridge University, whenever students tried to play at counterfactual history, the professors rebuked them soundly, so please don't tell anyone that I answered this question. I believe there's a mixture of two things going on here. At the end of the day, and even officials admit this (as hinted at in the thank-you letter from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Baskin), Baskin and his tenaciousness made the breakthrough. On the other hand, it is important to note that the primary player in the Shalit affair is Prime Minister Netanyahu himself. He's the one who ultimately decided to cut across all of the red lines that he himself had drawn, and to make massive concessions to Hamas. This decision was down to Netanyahu, and of course his interaction with a very particular constellation of events inside Israel and in the Middle East.
Q.

One Israeli for 1,027 Palestinians is difficult math to get one's head around. But the equation becomes easier to understand if you are the father or mother of the one Israeli. You write about the Shalit family and Miriam Grof in the story. Was Aviva Shalit's response to her son's disappearance - public suffering more than private demands of officials - more effective than Grof's?
A.
I don't think so. Miriam Grof didn't keep her feelings and her pain to herself or in closed forums, but rather she lashed out at the government through the media and thereby intimidated the decision makers. It was precisely the relatively restrained response of the Shalit family during the first two years after Gilad's abduction - a restraint that was their natural demeanor - that in my opinion caused the delay in his release and gave Israeli leaders a sense that they were not under public pressure.
Q.
Can you name one or two of the wider changes that made it possible for Netanyahu to accept the swap at the time he did? You say that he was desperate for a positive development because of the collapse of health care "among other things."
A.
Last summer, Israel experienced an unprecedented phenomenon - hundreds of thousands of protestors took to the streets demanding profound changes. Under the slogan "The people demand social justice," members of the middle class protested that although they worked hard, they couldn't afford to buy property, provide their children with a decent education or enjoy proper health care. These protests, together with deteriorating relations with the United States and the grave process of delegitimization that Israel is undergoing on the world scene because of the continuing occupation of the Palestinian territories and the deadlocked peace process, helped push Netanyahu to take a drastic step that he knew would be very popular.
Q.
What has the reaction in Israel been like to your article? Shalit's release seemed like such a cause for celebration that even fathers of children killed by Palestinians who were released like Yossi Mendellevich could say they were happy for Shalit and his family. But is anyone arguing that this sort of uneven swap is immoral or unsustainable?
A.
Since the piece appeared, there have been a great deal of responses here in the Middle East, most of them, I am pleased to say, positive. The negative reactions have come from two opposing directions - some Jews and Israelis who find the article too left-wing and "anti-Israel," and some Arab sources who read it as Zionist propaganda. The way I see it, if these two extremes are against me, I feel that I must have done something right.
The story touches on a controversy that split the Israeli public in two. The majority supported the deal, but it also had many opponents. Last Friday I traveled to the north of the country to visit my father and show him the article. He picked up the magazine, gazed at the cover for a long time and said: "I'll read it later. Right now it just makes me very angry - how can a country go down on its knees before a terrorist organization and let so many murderers loose who will soon go back to killing? Of course it's easy for me to speak, because it wasn't my son, and if they kidnapped you, I would drive the whole world crazy to get you back, but a prime minister has to take considered, balanced decisions and to think of the public interests and not to behave as if it was his son."
Q.
Miriam Grof's activism on behalf of her captured son was what led to the release of the man who later founded Hamas, the movement that abducted Shalit. How likely is it that one of the 1,027 released will be instrumental in capturing another Israeli soldier? Is this a cycle?
A.
The modern history of the Middle East is one of a never-ending cycle of blood, assassination, vengeance, abduction and counter-abduction that only gets worse as time goes on. My reply to this question, I am disheartened to say, is Yes, it is definitely possible that something like that will occur again.
Q.
The other option to free Shalit seems to have been a military strike like the Entebbe operation you describe. Yet this wasn't a viable alternative for obvious logistical reasons. Why couldn't Israeli intelligence locate Shalit?
A.
In this case, for once, Hamas had the upper hand. The Shin Bet security service's assumption was that Shalit was in the hands of a small, compartmentalized cell of people who held him for the whole duration of his captivity in an isolated location, probably underground, into which no electronic communications equipment was taken apart from the radio receiver that they gave Shalit. Hamas maintained absolute radio silence and never mentioned Shalit in any electronic communications or allowed any visits, packages or letters, either in or out. Thus, despite massive efforts, the expenditure of hundreds of millions of shekels and the risk of human lives, and despite the fact that the Gaza Strip is so small and so crowded, Israeli intelligence failed to locate him.
Q.
Can you tell me more about that Hebrew phrase "the boss has gone crazy"? Is it no longer applicable to the way Israel deals with hostages?
A.
It seems to me that many Israelis would like the world to relate to them and their country under the heading "the boss has gone crazy." In other words, any strike against will lead to a disproportionate response, thereby creating a deterrent. I think that it is compromises like the Shalit deal and the inability to free hostages in pinpoint commando operations that inflate the desire to respond to crises using disproportionate measures. This is what happened in June 2006, when Israel launched a large-scale aerial bombardment of Gaza because of Shalit, as well as on July 12 2006, when Prime Minister Ehud Olmert went to war against Hezbollah in Lebanon after two soldiers were abducted. Both of these operations were failures, but they didn't change the approach. Two months ago, Palestinians tried to kidnap Israelis in a raid across the Egyptian border, and if they had succeeded in kidnapping, rather than killing, a number of Israelis, I am quite sure that Israel would have waged a large-scale ground campaign against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
Q.
What explains the hold that the Shalit story had on Israel for all those years? Was it a clever marketing campaign? The cardboard cutouts all over the country? Frustration that the government wasn't taking action? The fact that in a country where all young men and women are required to do military service it could have happened to anyone's child?
A.
All of the above are true and are interconnected, in two apparently contradictory ways. On the one hand, there's a kind of concern for one another, a sense of fraternity and mutual responsibility. These spring from Israelis' sense of being under siege - from the aftermath of the Holocaust and the recurrent wars - and the subsequent cooperation among most of them in the defense of and sacrifices for the security of the state. In most countries in the world, a person can live his entire life without ever seeing a soldier, except perhaps in ceremonies or parades. In Israel, most people have themselves served in the army, and everyone knows someone who was killed or wounded while in military service. If Shalit had been left in the hands of Hamas, many would have felt that tomorrow they or their children might share the same fate.
On the other hand, as a result of economic success, the individual has taken center stage, and the demand for sacrifice on behalf of the collective is far less popular in Israel today than it was 30 years ago. A P.O.W., or his parents, if he is a prisoner in an underground cell somewhere in Gaza, has the right to demand that the collective make a sacrifice for his sake. Shalit's public campaign didn't shape public opinion. It drew upon and intensified a trend that already exists.

HEADLINE: Mayor Reports Steady Growth, and Demand, for City's Hotels

BYLINE: PATRICK MCGEEHAN


HIGHLIGHT: Despite the ailing economy, New York remains an irresistible lure for many tourists, judging by the many occupied hotel rooms in the city. 

 BODY:
 At a tourism promotion whistle-stop in Long Island City, Queens, on Monday, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg celebrated the rising number of hotels opening in the city and the "important jobs" they provide. 
 Speaking on the roof of a hotel that opened three months ago, Mr. Bloomberg trumpeted the city's persistent power to draw tourists and the steady growth in the inventory of rooms for them to sleep in. By the end of the year, the mayor said, the city will have more than 90,000 hotel rooms and the number of visitors from out of town probably will have passed last year's record total of 48.8 million.
 An additional 7,000 rooms are scheduled to become available for rent this year, the mayor said. Hotel-building was just about the only bright spot for the city's construction industry after the recession took hold, and hotels and restaurants were among a few sectors that did not shed a lot of jobs. 
 But despite all of the growth, hotels in the city have managed to maintain an overall occupancy rate of about 85 percent this year without lowering their rates, Mr. Bloomberg said. "There's not a lot of deals being made," he said. "They don't have to discount."
 To buttress that claim, Mr. Bloomberg introduced his host, Henry Zilberman, whose Z Hotel is his first. Mr. Zilberman, an Israeli immigrant who has run a limousine business for many years, said the hotel, which charges about $200 a night, had been 87 percent full for the last two months. Business has been so good that he is considering raising the rates, which he said he wanted to keep about 30 percent below what similar accommodations would cost in Manhattan.
 Looking west across the East River, Mr. Zilberman said he provided a shuttle to take his guests across the Queensboro Bridge to and from Manhattan. "What you can see from here, you cannot see from there," he said.
 Mr. Bloomberg said the city would continue to tap hotel customers for additional tax revenue to help bridge budget gaps. Hoteliers had been lobbying the mayor to allow a temporary surtax of 0.875 percent to expire as scheduled on Nov. 30. The City Council is now expected to approve a two-year extension of the tax, which comes on top of a 5 percent levy on all hotel bills.
 With hotels remaining so popular, Mr. Bloomberg said, there was "no evidence that it has been detrimental" to their business, referring to the levy.

HEADLINE: Wyoming Congresswoman to Endorse Romney

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney's campaign is scheduled to announce the endorsement of Representative Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming on Monday. 

 BODY:
The presidential campaign of former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney is scheduled to announce the endorsement of Representative Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming Monday morning, adding a Tea Party voice to its chorus of congressional endorsements.
Ms. Lummis, who will serve as Mr. Romney's Wyoming campaign chair, is a solid fiscal and social conservative, and the Romney campaign hopes her support will underscore the already growing narrative that conservatives are rallying around Mr. Romney.
"Governor Romney's experience as both a chief executive and conservative businessman makes him highly qualified to lead our nation at this time - a time when the size and scope of the federal government threatens to overwhelm us," Ms. Lummis said in an e-mail statement released by the campaign. "I am honored to serve as his Wyoming Chairman and look forward to bringing his conservative message of fiscal responsibility to voters in my state."
Ms. Lummis, who serves on the House Appropriations Committee, was one of the founding members of Representative Michele Bachmann's Tea Party Caucus when Republicans retook the House in 2010. The Wyoming caucus is on March 6, better known as Super Tuesday.
"Congressman Lummis has served Wyoming well for the past 30 years and I am honored to have such a public servant leading my campaign in Wyoming," Mr. Romney said, in an e-mail statement released by his campaign.
First elected to Congress in 2008 as Wyoming's at large representative, Ms. Lummis is also an attorney and a rancher. 
In her statement, Ms. Lummis said that Mr. Romney was the best candidate for the tough economic climate.
"Recently, he highlighted the spending mess that we are in and how we can avert an economic crisis," she said. "The burdens now placed on small businesses and working Americans, and those who want to work, seem unbearable. I believe Mitt has emerged as the right person at the right time to lead America."

HEADLINE: Before We Bomb Iran, Let's Have a Serious Conversation

BYLINE: JOHN H. JOHNS


HIGHLIGHT: A retired general doesn't like what he's hearing from the Republican candidates. 

 BODY:
It is common for candidates in presidential primaries to use bellicose language to prove their toughness. This kind of rhetoric is especially useful in Republican primaries, where audiences have a firm belief in the use of military power to solve problems. But toughness and wisdom are not the same thing.
The difference between the two was on display in the discussion of Iran that opened Saturday night's Republican foreign policy debate, as it has been throughout the Republican campaign. Asked if he would consider a military option should current efforts fail to deter Iran's work on developing nuclear weapons, Mitt Romney said, "of course you take military action, it's unacceptable for Iran to have a nuclear weapon."

Newt Gingrich echoed Romney's call. Previously, Herman Cain called preemptive force against Iran his "option B." Even Jon Huntsman, who has been the most sober of the candidates on foreign policy, suggested that "if you want an example of when I would consider the use of American force, it would be that." Rick Perry let us know that he would support Israeli military strikes too.
The problem with these arguments is that they flatly ignore or reject outright the best advice of America's national security leadership. Former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, retired chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mike Mullen, former congressman Admiral Joe Sestak and former CENTCOM Commander General Anthony Zinni are only a few of the many who have warned us to think carefully about the repercussions of attacking Iran. Two months ago, Sestak put it bluntly: "A military strike, whether it's by land or air, against Iran would make the aftermath of the Iraqi invasion look like a cakewalk with regard to the impact on the United States' national security."
While rhetoric about military strikes may work as an applause line in Republican debates, there is little or no chance that military action would be quite so simple. Quite the contrary. Defense leaders agree that the military option would likely result in serious unintended consequences.
Meir Dagan, the recently retired chief of Israel's Mossad, shares the assessment of the Americans cited above. He noted earlier this year that attacking Iran "would mean regional war" and went on to say that arguments for military strikes were "the stupidest thing I have ever heard."
To be clear: everyone can agree that Iran is a serious problem. The development of Iranian missile technology is credible enough that NATO is (smartly) working with Russia to develop a defensive missile shield. And the most recent report from the International Atomic Energy Agency on Iran's nuclear program should rally the international community to apply even more pressure.
But while Iran is a serious issue, it is equally true that they have been effectively isolated and weakened by the one-two punch of smart sanctions and the democratic winds sweeping through the region. The international sanctions have seriously damaged Iran's economy and exacerbated a growing feud between President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei. It is important to avoid steps that would unite these political blocs.
Meanwhile, Iran's most important regional ally, Syria, is struggling to avoid becoming the next regime toppled by a popular uprising. And given its own deep unpopularity with the Iranian public, the government may yet face a winter of domestic discontent. It has already had to face down strong segments of its population that want a less bellicose attitude toward the rest of the world.
We didn't ask the tough questions in 2003 when America went to war in Iraq in search of weapons of mass destruction. The security of America and the stability of a largely redrawn Middle East depend on our ability to continue to isolate and contain a weakened Iran.
Running for President means running for commander in chief of America's armed forces. If the candidates favor military action, as is their prerogative, they should desist from peddling the false notion of a simple "surgical" strike and answer the hard questions. How would they contain a larger regional war? Would they commit to a ground invasion? How would they pay for it? What is their view on the implications of another major deployment for the U.S. military? And why are they ignoring the advice of some of America's most experienced military leaders?
America ought not consider another war in the Middle East without a very serious discussion of the consequences. Political candidates should curb their jingoistic, chauvinistic emotions and temper their world view with a little reflective, rational thought.

HEADLINE: Geron Is Shutting Down Its Stem Cell Clinical Trial

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK

 BODY:
The company conducting the world's first clinical trial of a therapy using human embryonic stem cells said on Monday that it was halting that trial and leaving the stem cell business entirely.
The company, Geron, said that its move did not reflect a lack of promise for the controversial field. Rather, it said, with money scarce, it had decided to focus on its experimental cancer therapies, which are further along in development.
''I deeply believe in the promise of stem cells,'' John A. Scarlett, the chief executive of Geron, said in an interview. ''I don't think that promise is in any way, shape or form changed by what we're doing.'' 
Still, the move is expected to be widely seen as a setback for the field, because of Geron's central role.
The company, based in Menlo Park, Calif., helped pay for the initial derivation of human embryonic stem cells at the University of Wisconsin in the late 1990s, giving it fundamental patent rights in the field.
Then, in 2010, after a long struggle to win permission from the Food and Drug Administration, it started the first clinical trial of a therapy derived from embryonic stem cells, in spinal cord patients.
California's state stem cell agency, hoping to spur an early success, had agreed to lend Geron up to $25 million to pay for the trial. Dr. Scarlett said the company had returned $6.5 million, the amount it had borrowed so far, plus interest.
Embryonic stem cells can turn into virtually any type of tissue in the body, so some doctors are hopeful they might one day be used to create replacement cells or tissues to fight a vast array of diseases.
But the field has been controversial because creation of the embryonic cells usually involves the destruction of human embryos.
In the trial, nervous system cells derived from embryonic cells were injected into people with severe spinal cord injury.
So far four patients have been treated. Dr. Scarlett of Geron said that there were ''no signs'' that the treatment was helping the patients. But that was not expected in the initial trial, which was mainly looking at safety. And so far, he said, there had been no sign of safety problems.
Dr. Scarlett, who took over as chief executive less than two months ago, said that Geron was not divesting itself of the stem cell business because of the trial results. Rather, he said, it needed to conserve resources at a time when it was extremely difficult for small, unprofitable life science companies to raise capital.
By dropping the stem cell program -- the company is cutting its work force by 66 people, or 38 percent -- Geron will be able to last without needing to raise new money until it receives results of clinical trials of its cancer drugs over the next 18 months. By contrast, Dr. Scarlett said, given all the precautions in the stem cell field, he did not think there would be results from the stem cell trial until 2014.
Dr. Scarlett said that Geron hoped to sell or license the stem cell program to another company that would continue it.
So far, though, many big pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have been wary about trying to develop therapies using embryonic stem cells because of the political controversies and scientific and economic uncertainties.
Geron's withdrawal leaves Advanced Cell Technology as the only company now conducting a clinical trial involving human embryonic stem cells.
It has turned the embryonic cells into retinal cells, and these have been implanted into the eyes of two people suffering from two different forms of macular degeneration, a condition that can cause blindness. So far, results have not been reported.
There are many other trials for a variety of diseases using so-called adult stem cells, which are not as controversial.
Dr. Robert Lanza, the chief scientific officer of Advanced Cell Technology, said Geron's move was ''very unfortunate for the field'' and ''puts the pressure on us now.''
He said that spinal cord injury ''was not the ideal first indication for an embryonic stem cell therapy. Everyone knew it was going to be very difficult to show efficacy.''
Another company, StemCells Inc., is sponsoring a clinical trial testing neural stem cells derived from an aborted fetus as a treatment for spinal cord injury.

HEADLINE: Agencies Fulfill Their Holiday Wishes With New Executives

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
THIS time of year, advertising agencies are focused on the mad dash to Christmas, helping clients maximize opportunities to reach consumers during the crucial holiday shopping season.
At the same time, agencies are also focused inward by seeking to restock their executive suites. They are hiring managers for senior posts, many of which are new, as they hope to maximize opportunities for growth in the new year.
The significant changes that are remaking the industry, as well as the traditional churn in the top ranks at agencies, are also reasons for the volume of hiring that is taking place during the fourth quarter. All those factors mean that even at a time of high national unemployment, ''Help Wanted'' signs can still be found along Madison Avenue. 
The need to be ''on 24/7'' is also inspiring agencies to take another look at their staff needs, said Laurence Boschetto, president and chief executive at DraftFCB, a unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies that operates 161 offices in 96 countries.
Mr. Boschetto is creating a post at DraftFCB, global chief of staff, and bringing in a well-known industry executive to fill it. Other agencies have also recently hired chiefs of staff, among them the New York office of Euro RSCG Worldwide and Kirshenbaum Bond Senecal & Partners.
The new global chief of staff at DraftFCB, who is to be announced formally on Tuesday, is Peter Drakoulias, whose background includes business development, mergers and acquisitions, branded entertainment and licensing. Mr. Drakoulias, who is 51, has held jobs that include partner at another Interpublic agency, Deutsch; president at dRush, a joint venture between Deutsch and the hip-hop entrepreneur Russell Simmons; and principal of GAF Holdings, a consultancy.
''Laurence and I have known each other for somewhere around 20 years,'' Mr. Drakoulias said, ''and about a year ago he asked me to give some help with some merger-and-acquisition work.''
Mr. Boschetto recently asked him, ''Why don't we make it official?''
''The ad business is taking a page from politics and other industries at large'' by adding chiefs of staff, Mr. Drakoulias said, ''recognizing the value of this position.'' Mr. Drakoulias will be in the New York office of DraftFCB.
Mr. Drakoulias said he has been looking at digital properties on behalf of the agency, and ''we're close to announcing something'' in terms of a transaction or transactions.
Another agency hiring a senior executive for a new post is Digital Pulp in New York, which specializes in digital marketing and Web site development. Digital Pulp is bringing on Mitchell Caplan as partner and managing director, joining Ron Fierman, who is partner and president, and Gene Lewis, partner and creative director.
Mr. Caplan's appointment is also scheduled to be announced on Tuesday. Mr. Caplan has held high-level positions at both digital and traditional agencies, among them Merkley & Partners, Think New Ideas and Y&R.
One of his past jobs combined both realms, when he led Martin Interactive, the digital arm of the Martin Agency. Mr. Caplan's most recent post was as North American chief marketing officer at McCann Erickson Worldwide, part of the McCann Worldgroup division of Interpublic.
''We've known Mitch for a long time and flirted with him for 10 years in a variety of different ways,'' Mr. Fierman said.
And when Mr. Caplan was at Martin Interactive, he added, laughing, ''he was trying to bring us into the fold.''
The genesis of the decision to hire Mr. Caplan was a need for ''someone who has the digital chops and a proven track record in new business,'' Mr. Fierman said, ''to move us forward at a fast pace.''
Mr. Caplan, who is also 51, said: ''One reason I decided to move to a shop with a core digital competency is that some of the great work is being done by the digital shops. This has always been a passion for me and it's an opportunity to do the kind of work I really, really want to do.''
Digital Pulp works for clients that include Bausch & Lomb; Continental Airlines, which is becoming part of United Air Lines; Lancome; Mikimoto; New York University's Stern School of Business; and Redken.
Another example of the ardor among agencies to fill new posts came on Monday, when BBDO New York said it had hired Teddy Lynn to be its first executive vice president and director for content. The goal is to bolster the agency's offerings in the area of branded entertainment, the industry term for projects in which advertisers are integrated into the plots of television shows, online videos and movies.
Mr. Lynn had most recently been executive creative director for the global content and experiences team at Universal McCann, part of the Mediabrands division of Interpublic. BBDO New York is part of the BBDO North America unit of BBDO Worldwide, which is owned by the Omnicom Group.

HEADLINE: Plan for Bus Terminal Tower Is Dropped

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
For more than a decade, a prominent New York developer has sought to build a glass skyscraper over the Port Authority Bus Terminal, transforming an eyesore at the west end of Times Square into an architectural showpiece.
But last week, the developer, Vornado Realty Trust, told the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey that it had lost its Chinese investor and could not proceed with the 40-story tower over the north wing of the bus terminal, at the corner of 42nd Street and Eighth Avenue.
As a result, the on-again, off-again project may finally be dead. 
The tower, designed by the architect Richard Rogers of Rogers Stirk Harbour & Partners, was to have soared from a green garden atop the four-story terminal, with its snarling buses and charging commuters, offering panoramic views and plush space for corporate tenants. Elevators on the building's exterior would have carried tenants to the upper floors. Eighteen new boarding gates would have been built to ease the flow of rush-hour buses.
The apparent end of the project occurred after lengthy negotiations between Vornado and the Port Authority. Vornado's exclusive right to build the tower expired in August, after a series of extensions dating to 2007.
On Oct. 20, the Port Authority board voted to extend the agreement retroactively from Aug. 8, 2011, to Feb. 6, 2012, after Vornado said it had struck a deal with its Chinese partner, SOHO China, to invest $600 million in the project.
But the agreement was never signed by either Vornado or the Port Authority, although negotiations continued over the terms. The developer was to have paid the cost of the terminal renovations, which were estimated at $400 million or more.
SOHO China recently paid $600 million for a 49 percent stake in Park Avenue Plaza, a 45-story office tower at 299 Park Avenue.
Vornado told the Port Authority on Thursday that SOHO's investment in Park Avenue Plaza ''was a substitute for what SOHO was going to do at the bus terminal,'' according to one official.
Vornado was not prepared to proceed by itself. The real estate market has regained some momentum since the recession, but lenders remain skittish.
''Vornado informed the Port Authority of this recent development,'' Patrick J. Foye, the authority's executive director, said on Monday. ''I expect to sit down with Vornado shortly.''
The authority has had to cut its budget for new projects because of declining revenues. Several authority board members said they wanted to kill the project if it could not move forward, rather than give Vornado a free option on the development rights.
Steven Roth, Vornado's chairman, did not return calls requesting comment.
Some real estate experts have questioned the wisdom and cost of building an office tower over the busy bus terminal, which handles about 7,000 buses a day. (During construction, for example, the terminal would have to continue to function, making the work far more complicated.)
The project's prospects have ebbed and flowed with the real estate market. The authority first selected Vornado and a joint venture partner, the Lawrence Ruben Company, in 1999 to build a 35-story tower over the bus terminal. They were to have paid $110 million for the development rights under a 99-year agreement.
The authority hoped to capitalize on the revival of Times Square, a once seedy district suddenly awash in new theaters, office towers and retailers. Added in 1981, the north wing of the terminal was designed to accommodate a tower at some point in the future.
Vornado's tentative deal to build a headquarters for Cisco Systems over the bus terminal unraveled with the collapse of the dot-com boom in 2000. Vornado subsequently sued the Port Authority to retain the development rights.
The two sides revived the project in 2007 in the midst of another real estate boom, with the tower getting a new design from Mr. Rogers and more height. Officials said then that the deal was worth as much as half a billion dollars.

CORRECTION-DATE: November 22, 2011

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Tuesday about the apparent undoing of a plan by a New York developer, Vornado Realty Trust, to build a 40-story tower over the Port Authority Bus Terminal misidentified the section of the terminal that was designed to accommodate such a tower. It was the north section, added in 1981, where Vornado was to build a skyscraper -- not the original south part of the terminal, built in 1950.

HEADLINE: A Wide Decline in Shares As Debt Troubles Weigh

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS; Graham Bowley contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The stock market fell Monday after a jump in Italy's borrowing costs reminded investors of how much work remained to be done to contain Europe's debt problems.
The Dow Jones industrial average lost nearly 75 points. Bank stocks fell the most. European markets also fell and the euro weakened against the dollar.
Major indexes closed higher last week as Greece and Italy moved to form new governments and took other steps to get their debt troubles under control. But worrisome signs re-emerged Monday. 
The Italian government had to pay 6.29 percent at an auction of five-year bonds, the highest rate since 1997. Italy paid a much lower rate, of 5.32 percent, at a similar auction last month. The result of the auction was a sign that investors were still concerned about Italy's ability to repay its debts. Stocks fell sharply last Wednesday after important Italian borrowing rates jumped above 7 percent, a level widely seen as unsustainable.
Also on Monday, Italy's biggest bank, Unicredit, reported a $14.6 billion loss.
''The problems these countries are dealing with go well beyond their prime ministers,'' said Dan Greenhaus, chief global strategist at the brokerage firm BTIG. ''Italy didn't get where it is in five minutes. And it's not going to get out of where it is in five minutes. This is going to take months.''
The Dow fell 74.70 points, or 0.61 percent, to close at 12,078.98. Bank of America fell 2.6 percent and JPMorgan Chase fell 2.2 percent, the largest drops among the 30 large companies in the Dow.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 12.07 points, or 0.96 percent, to 1,251.78. The Nasdaq composite index fell 21.53 points, or 0.80 percent, to 2,657.22.
Three stocks fell for every one that rose on the New York Stock Exchange. Volume was very light at three billion shares.
Stocks have risen since early October on encouraging signs of progress in containing Europe's debt crisis, stronger United States corporate earnings and better news on the American economy. The S.& P. 500 has risen 13.7 percent since hitting its low for the year on Oct. 3.
That surge has drawn big investors back into the stock market and opened the door to a long line of companies waiting to go public. The flow of money from institutions into United States stock funds hit $7.3 billion last week, the third largest tally this year, according to a fund tracker, EPFR Global.
Angie's List, a customer review Web site, Delphi Automotive and seven other companies are scheduled to go public this week. If they all go through with their offerings, it would be the biggest week for public offerings in four years, according to Renaissance Capital, a firm that advises on stock offerings.
In corporate news, the airline Emirates placed an order for 50 Boeing 777s, one of the largest orders ever placed with the aircraft maker. Boeing also picked up a new customer, Oman Air, which ordered six 787s. Boeing rose 1.5 percent.
J. C. Penney fell 2.8 percent after reporting a quarterly loss. The department store operator said its results were weighed down by restructuring costs. The company also lowered its earnings outlook for the rest of the year.
Lowe's, the country's second-largest home-improvement retailer after Home Depot, rose 1.7 percent after it reported revenue and earnings that beat analysts' expectations.
The Dow has made gains in six of the past seven weeks, and is still up 1 percent for the month. The S.& P. 500 and the Nasdaq are slightly lower during that period.
Interest rates held steady on Monday. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note was up 3/32, to 99 19/32, and the yield slipped to 2.05 percent from 2.06 percent late Friday.

HEADLINE: Barclays Capital Rises, 'Big-Boy Checkbook' in Hand

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED

 BODY:
The American pipeline operator Kinder Morgan struck one of the biggest deals of the year nearly a month ago with its $21.1 billion purchase of a rival, the El Paso Corporation.
What was just as notable was the financing backing the deal - a $13.3 billion loan package arranged by Barclays Capital, one of the largest financing efforts that the bank had made on its own. It was the second time this year that the British investment bank took the initial financing of a megadeal upon its shoulders. In August, Barclays lent $8.3 billion to Hewlett-Packard to help pay for its $11.7 billion purchase of the British software company Autonomy.
Those loans are part of Barclays' continued efforts to move into the top ranks of advisers on mergers and acquisitions, a campaign begun when the London bank purchased the bulk of Lehman Brothers' North American investment bank in 2008. 
As of last Thursday, Barclays was ranked seventh among worldwide merger advisers, having participated in 148 deals worth more than $290 billion, according to data from Thomson Reuters. That is a step up from the ninth place that the company held in each of the last three years.
And in terms of deal lending, Barclays ranks in the top five this year, with more than $28 billion in syndicated loan proceeds, according to Thomson Reuters.
''We've long had a big-boy M.& A. business,'' Hugh E. McGee III, Barclays' head of investment banking and a Lehman veteran, said in an interview. ''And now we've got a big-boy checkbook.''
Yet the company still has a way to go. It trails its more established competitors, including JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America-Merrill Lynch, both in merger advice and in lending.
JPMorgan, for instance, is ranked third in deal advice and second in merger lending. And it still claims the crown for the biggest deal loan since the 2008 financial crisis, having initially shouldered a $20 billion loan to AT&T for its proposed $39 billion takeover of T-Mobile USA, a unit of Deutsche Telekom.
And a lending business does not guarantee a higher spot on the league tables, or rankings. BNP Paribas, for instance, ranks seventh for deal lending this year, but 13th for mergers advice. Goldman Sachs, on the other hand, ranks ninth in lending but leads the mergers league tables.
Mr. McGee concedes that his company still has some work to do. But he added that Barclays had made progress, including building investment banking operations in Europe and in Asia.
That campaign also includes lending to deals by longtime clients, as in the case of Kinder Morgan and H.P.
Barclays began discussions with Kinder Morgan on Sept. 8 about financing the El Paso takeover, several months after Kinder Morgan had begun discussing the deal with the American investment bank Evercore Partners, according to a regulatory filing.
What Barclays ended up providing was a three-part loan package that the bank initially shouldered on its own, though on Oct. 31 it sold pieces of the loan to 10 other banks.
As with the Hewlett-Packard and AT&T single-bank loans, the financing provided some speed and certainty to Kinder Morgan, allowing the company to avoid the normally time-consuming process of finding enough lenders to provide capital. It also helped clamp down on leaks by limiting the number of people with knowledge of the transaction.
While the loan appeared to be a risk - it was not rated investment grade - Barclays executives said they believed in the deal, which would create the biggest American operator of oil and natural gas pipelines. Kinder Morgan, after all, was a longtime client.
Barclays' single-bank loan offerings had some extra benefits for the bank's clients as well. Along with its loan to H.P., Barclays helped the technology giant hedge the currency risk in its Autonomy deal without tipping off others in the market.
Still, to some, Barclays' loans signify an effort to buy a better spot on deal league tables.
And the bank has gotten into some trouble for its lending practices before: last month, the company settled a shareholder lawsuit over the $5 billion takeover of Del Monte Foods, in which Barclays advised the seller. The plaintiffs had argued that Barclays, which advised Del Monte and provided financing to potential buyers, had an incentive to prevent a robust auction of the food company. Barclays ultimately agreed to pay $23.7 million and gave up $21 million in fees.
But Mr. McGee said the bank's aim was not to rely on lending to get into deals. Barclays is less likely to make a giant loan commitment if it is not one of the lead advisers on a transaction, he said, and is being discerning about to whom it lends.
''We want to lead with our relationships and then use our balance sheet,'' he said. ''We don't want to lead with our balance sheet.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Bank Excuses On Foreclosure Growing Stale

BYLINE: By MICHAEL POWELL. 
E-mail: powellm@nytimes.com

 BODY:
The Bank of America lawyer laid down a patented rhetorical move heard in courts across America. Your Honor, this Orange County, N.Y., homeowner -- a New York City police officer -- didn't make enough money to qualify for a mortgage modification. He didn't send us the right documents.
He didn't, he didn't, he didn't, and so we should be allowed to foreclose. 
Justice Catherine M. Bartlett of New York State Supreme Court cut off the lawyer. You, she said, are telling me lies.
''Bank of America got a bailout, and this is an outrage, how this man has been treated,'' she said. ''Hard-working, middle-class Americans are trying to make it, trying to refinance with your bank.''
Either bank officials show up in person, the justice said, or I'm going to order them ''here in handcuffs.''
Rage has acquired a cleansing power. Patience as a virtue is a hard sell at the burnt end of a four-year economic collapse. Zuccotti Park shakes, rattles and rolls; television yakkers chat about inequality; and the federal judge Jed Rakoff all but heckled the Securities and Exchange Commission last week for going easy on Citigroup misbehavior.
Then there is Eric T. Schneiderman, New York's attorney general, caught in Month 5 of a face-off with the White House. President Obama dearly wants to seal a deal in which the nation's largest banks toss over a few bales of cash -- $20 billion to help with foreclosure relief -- and the state attorneys general agree not to pursue sprawling and explosive legal cases against the banks.
Mr. Schneiderman and Attorney General Beau Biden of Delaware, joined by a few others, say no. Banks, they say, should disgorge more documents, testify more precisely and prove more completely that they own millions of mortgage notes. These rebel attorneys general want the banks to hand over more than $200 billion, which would enable the government to write down tens of millions of mortgages.
But in the end, their argument is elemental: Wouldn't the nation benefit from knowing the truth about the behavior of banks and bankers?
''If you don't air out the policies that led to the implosion of the economy, it will happen again,'' says Mr. Schneiderman. ''There's not one sentence in the proposed agreement, not one period or comma about the stuff that blew up the economy. We can't let the banks rewrite history.''
The desire to know precisely what happened during that give-a-mortgage-to-anyone-who-breathes, securitize-this frenzy has historical antecedents. In the Great Depression, the United States Senate hired another New York lawyer, Ferdinand Pecora, to write the report on its investigation of that collapse.
Mr. Pecora found more questions than answers, and insisted on more subpoenas, more forensic investigators and more brokers testifying under oath. Like a man reaching into a barrel of dead fish, he found a great stink. Not least, he discovered that National City (the lineal ancestor of the same misbehaving Citigroup) had sold flawed investments and that its president engaged in something close to tax evasion.
Seventy-eight years later, the Obama administration has Shaun Donovan, secretary of housing and urban development; the economic adviser Gene Sperling; and Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. dialing liberals, activists and bloggers, urging them to pressure the rebellious attorneys general to forgo emotionally satisfying inquiries and take the deal.
Banks make money and find loopholes, the president noted last month. These actions aren't ''necessarily against the law.''
That raises the question: How does he know?
Mr. Schneiderman is chary of talking too much now about his investigation. A few years back, he wrote an article for The Nation magazine, arguing that Democrats had for too long forsaken transformational politics for transactional, cut-a-deal politics. At the time, Washington Democrats dismissed such arguments as idealistic silliness.
Except that the cultural dial seems to be turning now.
Back in Orange County, the Legal Services lawyer Gina DeCrescenzo had fought for years to protect that New York police officer, William Castillo, filing motion after motion. No judge seemed to share her frustration until October, when Justice Bartlett threw out the foreclosure.
''You want to appeal me, you go right ahead,'' the judge told the bank lawyer. ''Because what happened here is disgusting.''

HEADLINE: A Place to Occupy And Get Results

BYLINE: By RICHARD BEALES, REYNOLDS HOLDING and EDWARD HADAS

 BODY:
Occupy Congress has garnered far less attention than the global protest movement that started as Occupy Wall Street in Lower Manhattan. But politicians helped create the financial crisis. Fresh news of American lawmakers trading on inside information is further reason for mistrust.
The evidence is tough to ignore. Beyond specific examples broadcast on Sunday by ''60 Minutes,'' studies led by Alan J. Ziobrowski of Georgia State University have found that stock portfolios modeled on those of United States senators and representatives beat the market each year by more than 10 percentage points and six percentage points, respectively. 
It's easy to see why that might be. Lawmakers get the scoop on bills or regulations that can send a company's or sector's shares soaring or plunging. But they've been allowed to slide under insider-trading law, partly because regulators have concluded that members of Congress don't owe anyone a legal duty to avoid trading on what they learn in their jobs.
This cramped reading of the law may suit some watchdogs, whose wages effectively come at the whim of lawmakers. But whatever the strict legalities, actions like selling stocks short the day after a closed-door Federal Reserve briefing on the 2008 financial collapse surely breach the public's trust.
Meanwhile, politicians refuse to make such snappy calls with the nation's finances. They have delayed even the smallest decisions they're supposed to make on behalf of their constituents.
One example was the bickering over raising the cap on the federal debt, which helped lead to the credit downgrade from Standard & Poor's. Another ongoing scandal is the failure, three years on, to even begin reforming Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government mortgage finance giants that have cost taxpayers tens of billions of dollars.
Then there was the general acceptance of laxity in bank regulation in the run-up to the 2008 crisis. Protesters have been railing against the influence of money in politics, but the cash used to elect people doesn't go straight into their pockets. Profits from insider trading once in office bridge that gap in the logic. Bankers can't be voted out. For that reason, Occupy Congress may have a better shot of achieving change than does Occupy Wall Street.
Bond Traders Awaken
Legend has it that a senior Swedish official, after a trip to New York in the midst of the Nordic country's financial crisis two decades ago, said: ''We shall never again trust our economy's future to the whims of 25-year-old men with too much testosterone.''
Many euro zone politicians and central bankers must feel the same way. Bond traders are a dangerously fickle lot. For years, traders hardly worried about fiscal strength inside the euro zone. From 2000 through 2007, the average difference between yields on 10-year bonds of Greece and Germany was 35 basis points. For Italy, it was 24 basis points. The recession of 2009 altered the traders' mood, but not by much. Spreads that year averaged 189 basis points for Greece and 102 for Italy.
Throughout the last decade, the European Central Bank expressed concerns about the market's almost blind optimism, but nothing substantial was done to shock the traders into alertness. Now, everything has changed. The bond market has become hyper-attentive to economic flaws and hyper-demanding of reform (inside the euro zone, though not for the United States or Britain).
The reformist zeal is welcomed by almost everyone -- except some insiders in the economic establishments of Italy and Greece. Many outsiders had always hoped the discipline of monetary union would lead to substantial reforms, but were disappointed by investors' complacency.
Still, there can be too much of a good thing, whether it is confidence or fear. Some investors seem to have decided to stay away from Italian debt until G.D.P. starts growing, the government runs a surplus and the European Central Bank declares it will limit their losses. Even then, they will probably demand spreads 10 times wider than in the precrisis days, when the issuing governments cared much less about deficits or transparency.
Warren Buffett once said of Mr. Market that ''the poor fellow has incurable emotional problems.'' The new prime ministers of Greece and Italy, and the new president of the European Central Bank, would dearly like to deal with more rational counterparties. The desire is legitimate, but comes late. As a result of inadequate anticipation, politicians and the central bank now must try to solve more complex problems.

HEADLINE: Bishops Open 'Religious Liberty' Drive

BYLINE: By LAURIE GOODSTEIN

 BODY:
BALTIMORE -- The nation's Roman Catholic bishops opened a new front in their fight against abortion and same-sex marriage on Monday, recasting their opposition as a struggle for ''religious liberty'' against a government and a culture that are infringing on the church's rights.
The bishops have expressed increasing exasperation as more states have legalized same-sex marriage, and the Justice Department has refused to go to bat for the Defense of Marriage Act, legislation that established the definition of marriage as between a man and a woman. 
''We see in our culture a drive to neuter religion,'' Archbishop Timothy M. Dolan of New York, president of the bishops conference, said in a news conference Monday at the bishops' annual meeting in Baltimore. He added that ''well-financed, well-oiled sectors'' were trying ''to push religion back into the sacristy.''
Archbishop Dolan also came prepared to answer questions about the sexual-abuse scandal at Penn State University, which has reminded so many observers of the Catholic Church's own abuse scandal. He said that the accusations against a former university football coach were a reminder that sexual abuse is a universal problem that affects most institutions.
''Every time that once again takes over the headlines we once again bow our heads in shame,'' the archbishop said. ''We know what you're going through, and you can count on our prayers.''
The bishops are struggling to reclaim the role they played in the 1980s and into the '90s as a nationally recognized voice on the moral dimension of public policy issues like economic inequality, workers' rights, immigration and nuclear weapons proliferation. Since then, however, they have reordered their priorities, with abortion and homosexuality eclipsing poverty and economic injustice.
But as the sexual-abuse scandal largely overshadowed their agenda in the last decade, their pronouncements on politics and morality have been met with indifference even by many of their own flock. The bishops issue guidelines for Catholic voters every election season, a document known as ''Forming Consciences for Faithful Citizenship,'' which is distributed in many parishes. But the bishops were informed at their meeting on Monday that a recent study commissioned by Fordham University in New York found that only 16 percent of Catholics had heard of the document, and only 3 percent had read it.
Nevertheless, the bishops remain a forceful political lobby, powerful enough to nearly derail the president's health care overhaul two years ago over their concerns about financing for abortion. Last week, the White House, cognizant of the bishops' increasing ire, invited Archbishop Dolan to a private meeting with President Obama, their second. Archbishop Dolan said they talked about the religious liberty issue, among others.
''I found the president of the United States to be very open to the sensitivities of the Catholic community,'' Archbishop Dolan said in the news conference. ''I left there feeling a bit more at peace about this issue than when I entered.''
But in an impassioned address to the prelates, Bishop William E. Lori of Bridgeport, Conn., the chairman of the bishops' newly established committee on religious liberty, said the church would urge priests and laypeople to take up the religious liberty cause. Bishop Lori said that in states like Illinois and Massachusetts, and in the District of Columbia, Catholic agencies that received state financing had been forced to stop offering adoption and foster care services because those states required them to help same-sex couples to adopt, just as they helped heterosexual couples.
Bishop Lori said in his speech, ''The services which the Catholic Church and other denominations provide are more crucial than ever, but it is becoming more and more difficult for us to deliver these services in a manner that respects the very faith that impels us to provide them.''
The bishops have also been lobbying the Department of Health and Human Services to expand the religious exemption to the mandate in Mr. Obama's health care overhaul that requires private insurers to pay for contraception. The exemption, as currently written, would still require Catholic hospitals and universities to cover birth control for most of their employees -- which the church says is a violation of its religious freedom.
Some liberal Catholic commentators have criticized the bishops' priorities, saying they are playing into the culture wars. John Gehring, Catholic outreach coordinator with Faith in Public Life, a liberal religious advocacy group in Washington, said, ''The bishops speak in hushed tones when it comes to poverty and economic justice issues, and use a big megaphone when it comes to abortion and religious liberty issues.''

HEADLINE: Where Soccer Has Been a One-Way Ticket Out

BYLINE: By JAMES MONTAGUE

 BODY:
KIGALI, Rwanda -- In the fading light and steady rain at Amahoro Stadium, the Eritrea national soccer team trained in silence Monday as it prepared for one of its most important matches since securing independence from Ethiopia in 1993.
The team, known as the Red Sea Boys and ranked 190th by FIFA, will face Rwanda on Tuesday in the second leg of their 2014 World Cup preliminary qualifier. If Eritrea wins, it will advance to the second round, a group stage. 
But the most important number after the match may not be how many goals Eritrea scores, but how many of its players are on the plane back home.
This is the first time Eritrea has played away from home in two years. The last time the national team left Eritrea, for a regional tournament in Kenya in 2009, the entire team disappeared after a match, later claiming asylum at Nairobi's United Nations High Commission for Refugees before being resettled in Australia.
Eritrea is considered among the most repressive countries in the world. The players' defections gained attention internationally after a diplomatic cable titled ''Eritrea's squabbling colonels, fleeing footballers, frightened librarians'' and dated Dec. 15, 2009, was released by Wikileaks. In it, the United States ambassador Ronald K. McMullen wrote: ''Human rights abuses are commonplace and most young Eritreans, along with the professional class, dream of fleeing the country, even to squalid refugee camps in Ethiopia or Sudan.''
A 2011 report on Eritrea by Human Rights Watch described how torture remained routine, how the continual state of conscription has destroyed the economy, and how up to 50,000 Eritreans live in Ethiopian refugee camps.
Athletes are among the few who can leave the country legally. But many do not return. In July, 13 players from Eritrea's top club Red Sea fled in Tanzania. Four players from the same team defected while playing in Kenya in 2006.
''Yes, something must be mended and we are trying to find out the cause,'' said Kahsay Embaye, the vice president of Eritrea's soccer federation. ''But sometimes it is also a conspiracy by some people who are abroad.''
In a section called ''Soccer Team 1-Regime 0,'' the diplomatic cable described reports of the players' defections, and said that President Isaias Afewerki would ''undoubtedly try to twist logic in some way to blame the United States'' for the players' leaving.
But the cable also described the small country's passion for soccer. ''Many dusty streets in Asmara are filled with urchins kicking an old sock stuffed with rags back and forth between goals made of piled stones,'' the cable said. ''Senior government and party officials are avid fans of the British Premier League and sometimes leave official functions early to catch key matches.''
Of the 12 players who defected, 11 went to Adelaide, Australia. Local soccer clubs arranged for four of them to share a house and arranged local jobs for them. Nevi Gebremeskel, a 21-year-old defender who just finished his season playing for White City Woodville, a team in the South Australian Premier League, said that the Eritrean soccer officials led him to flee, not the government.
''We need to play and we had a big problem with the federation,'' he said in a telephone interview. ''If anyone got the chance to go overseas, any team from any country, they didn't allow them to go.''
Speaking of the day the players defected, Gebremeskel said they had a meeting after the team finished the tournament in Kenya.
''We were all having the same thoughts, so we had the big meeting,'' he said. ''Yes, I was scared. ''We didn't have anything when we left. All we had was our kit.''
Negash Teklit, the team's coach, smiled awkwardly when the defections were mentioned. Teklit, a former star of the Ethiopian national team before Eritrea gained independence, has coached the team for 11 years and was in charge at that tournament in 2009.
''This problem is not Eritrean only,'' he said. ''This is a problem of African youths all over the world. They can immigrate from one country to another.''
He added: ''We have many players still. This generation and especially this team is the best team.''
The team had to be rebuilt from scratch. A team of teenagers, picked from Eritrea's under-17 and under-20 squads, train in the jerseys of their heroes from England, France and Italy.
Eritrea's young team has managed to compete. The first leg against Rwanda, played at altitude in Asmara, ended in a 1-1 draw.
Teklit said that the federation learned its lesson and that some players were allowed to play professionally in a handful of friendly countries to avoid any more embarrassing defections.
''We make the players go out and get professional exposure in Qatar, Sudan, Kuwait,'' he said. He added: ''We need the players to play at home first and not to hold them. But if they want to go, they can go.''
Tuesday's game is the first litmus test of Eritrea's new policy. Embaye, the federation vice president, remains confident that after the game with Rwanda, all of the 18 members of the squad will return home.
''That is 100 percent sure,'' he said.
In Adelaide, Gebremeskel follows the national team. He said his fellow Eritrean players, two of whom play for Gold Coast United, one of Australia's top professional teams, were still friends and had built a community around their shared experiences. He said he was convinced that more ambitious soccer players would follow the path he and his teammates forged.
''Life is very good here, very, very good,'' Gebremeskel said. ''Everyone is happy to live. If you need to work, you can work.
''Even tomorrow, after the game, the same thing is going to happen. Everyone has the right to a new life. I don't think they'll come back.''

HEADLINE: Major Changes In Health Care Likely to Last

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON, GARDINER HARRIS and ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
For the nation's health care system, there may be no going back.
No matter what the Supreme Court decides about the constitutionality of the federal law adopted last year, health care in America has changed in ways that will not be easily undone. Provisions already put in place, like tougher oversight of health insurers, the expansion of coverage to one million young adults and more protections for workers with pre-existing conditions are already well cemented and popular.
And a combination of the law and economic pressures has forced major institutions to wrestle with the relentless rise in health care costs.
From Colorado to Maryland, hospitals are scrambling to buy hospitals. Doctors are leaving small private practices. Large insurance companies are becoming more dominant as smaller ones disappear because they cannot stay competitive. States are simplifying decades of Medicaid rules and planning new ways for poor and rich alike to buy policies more easily. 
But how to pay for these changes, and what will happen to the 30 million uninsured Americans the law intends to cover, will be up in the air if the mandate at the heart of the law -- the requirement that individuals buy health insurance or face a penalty -- is struck down.
The election results of 2010 and stiff state opposition to the mandate also complicate the picture. Hospital administrators, insurers and doctors are counting on federal subsidies and coverage expansion that would result in a surge of patients with insurance to offset cuts in government programs that many fear could soon become draconian. Large health systems could then use their newfound clout to demand higher prices from private insurers even as federal and state governments pay less.
Other changes influenced by the legislation may leave some patients and doctors lost in the new land of giants. As medicine moves from a cottage industry to one dominated by large organizations, some patients with insurance will probably find their choices more limited. But their care may be better coordinated, as hospitals, doctors and even insurers join to streamline services.
''The system is transforming itself,'' said Charles N. Kahn III, president of the Federation of American Hospitals. ''But the success of these changes depends a lot on whether there is sufficient funding.''
Hospital systems are anticipating a major influx of federal funds and patients as a result of the law. In Maryland, for instance, the Johns Hopkins Hospital and Health System recently bought two suburban hospitals and is spending several hundred million dollars on computer systems to link its clinics and hospitals across the state. It has hired hundreds of primary care doctors and nurses, forged partnerships with urgent care clinics and expanded home health service to serve an expected flood of new patients.
''If the law is struck down, health care reform will have to continue one way or another,'' said Patricia Brown, president of Johns Hopkins HealthCare.
Across town, Baltimore Medical System, a community health center, expects to expand its medical staff by 50 percent over the next three years to accommodate an anticipated increase in patients to 70,000 from 47,000.
''We are looking for new clinicians on a constant basis,'' said Jay Wolvovsky, the system's chief executive, who said that hiring would stop if the law were overturned and federal funding were in doubt. ''We wouldn't be able to expand and we'd be stuck where we are.''
In states like Texas, the law is deeply unpopular, and the medical association has a ''Calendar of Doom'' listing the timeline for important provisions of the law and other government rules. Still, changes in delivering medical care are taking hold, including a move away from small doctor practices that were predominant for more than a century.
Texas medicine will never be the same no matter what happens with the law, said Louis J. Goodman, the association's chief executive, and older doctors blame a cascade of new rules and changes well beyond the new health law. ''There's a feeling among doctors here that government is crushing them,'' Mr. Goodman said.
And even though critics say the law does little to reduce the costs of care, its passage touched off myriad efforts to pare widespread waste.
''The interest from the doctor and hospital community has accelerated,'' Tom Richards, a senior executive at Cigna, said of efforts to exact savings and improve care.
The law's passage was ''a statement that things need to change and that the status quo doesn't work,'' said Paul Markovich, chief operating officer at Blue Shield of California, a health insurer based in San Francisco. ''It sends a loud message to all the players.''
So far, other requirements under the law have prompted state regulators, insurers and others to work with federal officials over new regulations.
For example, insurance companies now must spend at least 80 cents of every dollar they collect on health care for their customers, limiting how much they are permitted to spend on brokers' commissions, executive salaries and profits.
Federal and state regulators were granted greater authority to review insurers' proposals for raising premiums, and the federal government has already awarded the states about $155 million in grants to help their oversight efforts.
The new rules appear to have had some effect, with some insurers deciding to hold down premiums to avoid being forced to refund money or justify higher rates. ''That scrutiny is important,'' said Sandy Praeger, the insurance commissioner in Kansas.
Some states are taking matters even further than the federal law, to adopt changes regardless of whether it is ruled void. ''What we've tried to do here in California is to take the provisions of the Affordable Care Act and put them in the state law so we can move towards implementation,'' said Dave Jones, the state's insurance commissioner. He credited closer review of insurance rates for saving residents about $87 million a year.
Federal officials have already awarded nearly $516 million to states to help build new insurance exchanges, although some states whose officials are opposed to the law, like Florida and Alaska, have either refused the money or postponed any plans in hopes of getting the legislation overturned.
There is no question that creating insurance exchanges that would provide coverage for more than 20 million uninsured Americans would be more difficult without the backing of the law. Peter V. Lee, a former Obama administration official who is heading the exchange effort in California, said the state already has rules that make it possible to create a marketplace for small businesses, but covering individuals without federal subsidies and a mandate would ''be a challenge for the system.'' California has received about $40 million in federal funds for its efforts.
Even without a significant expansion of Medicaid for the exchanges, state programs will soon be transformed through a provision that tries to standardize some of the byzantine eligibility and other rules. It requires states to offer a single, simple Internet application for not only Medicaid recipients but everyone seeking care on health exchanges.
Toby Douglas, director of the California Department of Health Care Services, said that eligibility currently varies not only by income but by whether someone is disabled, a child, a parent or is pregnant. The forms are primarily filled out by hand, and income, immigration and other documents are required for verification.
The new system will rely on a single measure of income in every state, not by age, sex or parental status, and verification will be made by automatic links to federal tax and immigration databases. It is intended to be simple and cheap. ''This is the opportunity to dramatically overhaul the complicated rules,'' Mr. Douglas said.
Other states clearly have not been so enthusiastic in embracing even minor provisions of the legislation, and more than two dozen are involved in legal challenges to the law. Last week, Ohio voters rejected the federal mandate that residents buy insurance, although the outcome has little practical effect. And Georgia is the latest of six states to persuade federal officials to waive the rules limiting how much insurers are permitted to spend on overhead rather than medical care.
If the Supreme Court strikes down the individual mandate, it would need to decide whether other provisions of the law could survive -- or whether they were so inextricably tied to the mandate that they too must be set aside. The question has provoked much debate and produced conflicting answers from judges. The Justice Department has said that the individual mandate cannot be separated from the requirement for insurers to offer coverage, regardless of pre-existing conditions. In Congress, the outlook for the health care law continues to be precarious. Republicans have kept up a steady barrage of criticism, in speeches and at hearings. The law is increasingly unpopular with the public, including Democrats, according to recent surveys.
Even if the Supreme Court upholds the law's requirement for many employers to offer coverage to workers, it is not clear that Congress will want to keep the requirement in its current form or see it vigorously enforced. With the nation's unemployment rate stubbornly stuck around 9 percent, businesses often cite the costs of providing health care coverage as one of the reasons they cannot hire or expand their work force.
''The law makes it harder and more expensive for job creators to hire new people,'' Senator John Barrasso, Republican of Wyoming who is an orthopedic surgeon, said. ''Under the law, businesses are permitted to drop out of paying for employer-provided coverage as long as they pay a fine. And the fine is about $2,000 per employee. This number is far smaller than what it would actually cost the business to provide family health benefits to their employees.''
Just last week, an inspector general's report from the Treasury Department indicated that fewer small businesses than expected had taken advantage of a tax credit under the law that encourages providing coverage for employees.
Despite opposition in some corners and lukewarm reception in others, a wholesale repeal of the law by Congress may be unlikely. Lawmakers may find it unpalatable to abandon the entire effort, given the fact that critics of the law have not agreed on one comprehensive proposal that would offer coverage to anywhere near the 50 million Americans who are still without coverage. Even if the law goes into effect, an estimated 20 million will still be without insurance. ''It's hard to completely reverse course,'' said Drew E. Altman, the chief executive of the Kaiser Family Foundation.
But as Congress searches for ways to save money, the funds necessary for larger Medicaid enrollment and subsidies for low-income people to buy private insurance are in more jeopardy. Governors of both parties have said they fear that states, many in fiscal distress, will eventually be required to share more of the new costs. Many have cut Medicaid programs already.
For all the changes taking place, there are many areas where political opposition and economic constraints will play a critical role in determining just how much the marketplace will change over the next several years. Patrick J. Geraghty, president and chief executive of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Florida, where the state's governor has refused any federal funds to set up new exchanges, emphasized that the road ahead would be a struggle with or without the federal law.
Florida has cut Medicaid as part of its overall budget-tightening, even though the state has one of the highest rates of uninsured Americans in the country, and relief for them is unlikely to come any time soon.
''All of this plays out against the political reality and the practical reality,'' Mr. Geraghty said.

HEADLINE: A Little Old Work Fills a Big New Space

BYLINE: By ZACHARY WOOLFE

 BODY:
KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Across the street from my hotel here is the stately stone Lyric Theater. Built as a Shriners' hall in 1926, it has also served as a Red Cross blood collection center, a playhouse, a radio studio and a movie theater called the Capri.
In 1970 the Lyric Opera of Kansas City moved in. Then just 12 years old and part of what Time magazine called ''the American operatic explosion,'' the company flourished in the space. It built a reputation for nurturing rising artists and presenting contemporary American works as well as the old standbys. 
Last month the Lyric Opera, along with the Kansas City Symphony and the Kansas City Ballet, moved its performances to the majestic new Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts. Barely half a mile down the road from the old theater, now sitting mostly unused, the Kauffman Center feels like another world, the soaring, glass-walled future to the Lyric Opera's soberly symmetrical past.
The company's first season in its new home began with Puccini's lavish ''Turandot.'' The production was intended to make clear that grand opera can stand up to even the grandest architecture. But the company wanted to follow up with something more intimate, to show its range and prove that smaller works needn't vanish in the imposing center.
The Lyric Opera has little to worry about on that front. In Kristine McIntyre's breezy production, which I saw at the final performance of its run on Sunday afternoon, Mozart's ''Cosi Fan Tutte'' never seemed dwarfed by its surroundings. The opera house's acoustics are bright and clean, if a little dry, and they project young voices well.
The production has updated the action to a swank seaside resort during the Roaring Twenties: airy blue skies, boardwalk, period deck chairs and slinky beaded gowns. It was simple and effective, much like the theater's interior, with its straightforward lines and attractive blond wood. (On the other hand, the incised metal used on the front of each tier has the slightly cheesy look of shiny wrapping paper.)
True to its traditions, the company cast young and likable singers, led by the elegant baritone David Won as Guglielmo. The tenor Matthew Plenk has sung several small roles at the Metropolitan Opera; here, as Ferrando, he had a strong, sweet voice that sometimes sounded pressured rather than ideally free.
As their two fiancees, the soprano Amanda Hall (Fiordiligi) and the mezzo-soprano Marie Lenormand (Dorabella) made an exciting blend, sounding smoother and richer together than they did individually. Ms. Hall didn't quite have the force in her low register to make her arias powerful, but her high notes gleamed, and in ''Per pieta,'' especially, she gave the affecting sense -- so elusive and important -- of a woman trying to figure out her emotions in front of you.
While the mezzo-soprano Susanne Mentzer, a favorite Dorabella at the Met in the 1990s and a perky Despina here, still has the sunny top of her voice intact, the rest can become tremulous. The bass-baritone John Stephens was a bland Don Alfonso, a serious drawback, given that enigmatic character's centrality to the opera. The conducting of Ward Holmquist, the company's artistic director, was crisp but a bit stiff, lacking in energy and poetry.
Like every opera company in America, the Lyric Opera has taken a hit from the economic downturn. For two seasons Gilbert and Sullivan chestnuts took the place of more adventurous works. But the company has not had to resort to the more drastic measures taken elsewhere, like canceling whole seasons or substituting concerts for staged opera.
Instead the Lyric Opera's ambitious plans have become reality: the move to the Kauffman Center, as well as the opening of a new administrative and production center nearby. John Adams's ''Nixon in China'' arrives in March; those Gilbert and Sullivans, it turns out, were no more than a temporary retrenchment.

HEADLINE: Qatar Wields Outsize Influence in Arab Politics

BYLINE: By ANTHONY SHADID

 BODY:
DOHA, Qatar -- Qatar is smaller than Connecticut, and its native population, at 225,000, wouldn't fill Cairo's bigger neighborhoods. But for a country that inspires equal parts irritation and admiration, here is its resume, so far, in the Arab revolts: It has proved decisive in isolating Syria's leader, helped topple Libya's, offered itself as a mediator in Yemen and counts Tunisia's most powerful figure as a friend.
This thumb-shaped spit of sand on the Persian Gulf has emerged as the most dynamic Arab country in the tumult realigning the region. Its intentions remain murky to its neighbors and even allies -- some say Qatar has a Napoleon complex, others say it has an Islamist agenda. But its clout is a lesson in what can be gained with some of the world's largest gas reserves, the region's most influential news network in Al Jazeera, an array of contacts (many with an Islamist bent), and policy-making in an absolute monarchy vested in the hands of one man, its emir, Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani.
Qatar has become a vital counterpoint in an Arab world where traditional powers are roiled by revolution, ossified by aging leaderships, or still reeling from civil war, and where the United States is increasingly viewed as a power in decline. 
''Do they fill a void? Yes,'' said Bassma Koudmani, a Syrian opposition leader who credited the Qataris with a key role in the Arab League's startling decision Saturday to suspend Syria and isolate a government at the pivot of the region's relations. ''They are filling a space and a role that is not being taken up by other countries.''
Flanked by the region's biggest rivals, Saudi Arabia and Iran, Qatar has always played an outsize role in the gulf, but never to this degree. It hosts a sprawling American air base, but some American officials are suspicious of its recent backing of Islamist leaders, particularly in the war in Libya.
Angry at its role in driving the Arab League vote, Syrian officials have called it a lackey of American and Israeli interests. On Monday, Syria declared that it would boycott next month's Arab Games in Doha.
But for all the contradictions in its policies -- and there are many -- Qatar is advancing a decisive shift in Arab politics that many in the West have yet to embrace: a Middle East dominated by mainstream Islamist parties brought to power in a region that is more democratic, more conservative and more tumultuous.
''Qatar is a country without ideology,'' said Talal Atrissi, a Lebanese political analyst and commentator. ''They know that the Islamists are the new power in the Arab world. This alliance will lay the foundation for a base of influence across the region.''
Not everyone is pleased.
''Who is Qatar?'' Abdel-Rahman Shalgham, Libya's ambassador to the United Nations, asked sharply this month on the Arabic channel of a German satellite station.
Syrian officials have asked that question as the crisis deepens between two once-friendly countries. Personal sentiments seem to figure heavily in Qatar's policy, as with Libya, where the emir's wife, Sheika Mozah, spent time as a child. The country long served as an intermediary with Syria, and it invested heavily in an economy that President Bashar al-Assad sought to modernize. But diplomats and analysts say SheikHamad felt rebuffed by Mr. Assad in April, soon after the uprising in Syria began.
Some view Qatar's policy in Syria through a sectarian lens, supporting as it does a predominantly Sunni Muslim revolt. (It also backed Saudi Arabia's intervention in neighboring Bahrain to help quell Shiite Muslim protests.) Others see it more opportunistically, offering Qatar a way to realign a Middle East in which Syria has often played off competing powers -- Turkey, Iran, Israel, Saudi Arabia and actors in Lebanon.
''Syria is such a crucial pivot point in the Middle East,'' said Salman Shaikh, the director of the Brookings Doha Center in Qatar. ''Syria would just be too tempting a target not to be involved in from the outside, and I'm sure the Qataris will be.''
Ambition dominates Doha, whose frenzied skyline suggests medieval Baghdad crossed with ''Blade Runner.'' Qatar's economy offers indicators in superlatives: the world's highest growth rate and highest per capita income. Its emir, a towering man whose girth was ridiculed by Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya, has sought to reconcile what could be considered irreconcilable.
Yusuf Qaradawi, an influential Egyptian Islamist figure, calls it home. So did Ali Sallabi, a prominent Libyan Islamist. Khaled Meshal, Hamas's leader, has a residence here, and speculation is rife that the Taliban in Afghanistan may open an office. American schools and companies, situated in the most modern of complexes, are also based here.
''Bring them here, give them money and it will work out,'' Hamid al-Ansari, a newspaper editor, said of Qatar's style, only half in jest.
Money proved instrumental in Qatar's role in Libya this year. Diplomats say hundreds of millions were funneled to the opposition, often through channels Qatar had cultivated with expatriates here, in particular Mr. Sallabi and Abdel Hakim Belhaj, the head of the Tripoli Military Council who once led an Islamist insurgency in Libya. A Libyan opposition channel was set up in Doha. Qatar dispatched Western-trained advisers, who helped finance, train and arm Libyan rebels.
But Qatar's seeming favoritism of Islamists there provoked the ire of more secular-minded figures. Qatari officials are dismissive of the charges, but others suggest Sheik Hamad, who overthrew his father in 1995, has an affinity for Islamist figures who echo the conservative gulf states far more than ostensibly secular figures like Syria's president, Mr. Assad.
''Historically speaking, dealing with those people is better than dealing with Qaddafi or Assad,'' Mr. Ansari said. ''We believe religion is important, they believe it.''
Maintaining channels with an array of forces has proven a cornerstone of Qatar's policy. It hosts two American bases, with more than 13,000 personnel; in Lebanon, the emir was welcomed as a hero by Hezbollah's supporters last year for helping rebuild towns Israel destroyed in 2006.
Unlike Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, Qatar enjoys close ties with the Muslim Brotherhood, in its various incarnations in Libya, Syria and Egypt, as well as with figures like Rachid al-Ghannouchi, the Tunisian Islamist, all of whom are almost certain to play a crucial role in the next generation of Arab politics.
But it also has what might be described as the Qatari equivalent of soft power: the influence of Al Jazeera, which the emir founded and finances, and which more and more reflects Qatari foreign policy; ties with Mr. Qaradawi, who has his own network of prominent Islamists in the region; and the emir's own knack for involving Qatar in conflicts as far-flung as Afghanistan and the Darfur region of Sudan.
Most recently, Al Jazeera's director general, Wadah Khanfar, departed in what some journalists there saw as part of Qatar's determination to appease countries like Saudi Arabia and Jordan, both long irritated by Al Jazeera's reporting.
American diplomatic cables in 2009, released by WikiLeaks, claim that Qatar has occasionally offered Al Jazeera's coverage as a bargaining tool. A senior journalist there said while no order was given, the network's reporting on Syria changed sharply in April.
''We could feel the change in atmosphere,'' the journalist said.

HEADLINE: Gathering At the Wake For Western Dominance

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI

 BODY:
CIVILIZATION
The West and the Rest
By Niall Ferguson
Illustrated. 402 pages. The Penguin Press. $35.
In his 2003 book, ''Empire,'' which was published here in the immediate wake of the United States-led invasion of Iraq, the popular British historian Niall Ferguson argued that the United States was ''an empire in denial'' and was ''capable of playing an imperial role'' in the world today, much the way Britain once did, in the 19th century.
Only eight years later Mr. Ferguson has written a tendentious new book, ''Civilization,'' which asserts, with similar certainty, that we are now living through ''the end of 500 years of Western predominance,'' that while China is on the rise, the question is not whether East and West will clash, but whether ''the weaker'' -- that is, the United States and Europe -- ''will tip over from weakness to outright collapse.''
The financial crisis ''that began in the summer of 2007,'' Mr. Ferguson argues, should ''be understood as an accelerator of an already well-established trend of relative Western decline,'' coming on top of already serious debt problems. 
''From 2001, in the space of just 10 years,'' he goes on, ''the U.S. federal debt in public hands doubled as a share of G.D.P. from 32 percent to a projected 66 percent in 2011''; when ''unfunded liabilities of the Medicare and Social Security systems,'' growing state deficits and public employees' pension funds are added on to projections, he contends, ''the fiscal position of the United States in 2009 was worse than that of Greece,'' which is now teetering on the edge of default and desperate for a bailout from the European Union.
As usual, Mr. Ferguson, who teaches in Harvard's history department and business school, uses his powerful narrative talents in these pages to give the reader a highly tactile sense of history. But his book as a whole has a hurried, haphazard feel to it that underscores its genesis as a companion volume to a British television series called ''Civilization: Is the West History?'' Not only do the book's more cogent arguments owe a decided debt to ones made by the New York Times Op-Ed columnist Thomas L. Friedman and the CNN commentator Fareed Zakaria, but its more original hypotheses also tend to devolve into questionable generalizations (''Europeans today are the idlers of the world''), contradictory assertions and silly Power Point schemas that strain painfully to be relevant and hip.
Indeed, the central thesis of ''Civilization'' is that six ''killer apps'' (along with ''the fortuitous weakness of the West's rivals'') enabled the West ''to dominate the world for the better part of 500 years.'' Those ''apps'' were competition, science, property rights, medicine, ''the consumer society'' (''without which the Industrial Revolution would have been unsustainable'') and ''the work ethic'' (which Mr. Ferguson, drawing upon Max Weber, associates with Protestant Christianity).
Much as Mr. Zakaria did in ''The Post-American World'' (2008), Mr. Ferguson notes that in recent decades much of the rest of the world has become increasingly adept at downloading such Western concepts.
Japan, Mr. Ferguson writes, began ''copying everything, from Western clothes and hairstyles to the European practice of colonizing foreign peoples,'' and in the 1950s ''a growing band of East Asian countries followed Japan in mimicking the West's industrial model, beginning with textiles and steel and moving up the value chain from there.'' China, of course, has not only become a vigorous market society, with the world's largest population, but also an economic behemoth, holding more than $1 trillion in United States debt.
''In demographic terms,'' Mr. Ferguson says, ''the population of Western societies has long represented a minority of the world's inhabitants, but today it is clearly a dwindling one. Once so dominant, the economies of the United States and Europe are now facing the real prospect of being overtaken by China within 20 or even 10 years, with Brazil and India not so very far behind. Western 'hard power' seems to be struggling in the Greater Middle East, from Iraq to Afghanistan, just as the 'Washington Consensus' on free-market economic policy disintegrates.''
Mr. Ferguson's decision to structure this volume around his six ''killer apps'' -- a decision based, no doubt, on the six-part structure of the British Channel 4 series -- results in a book that, oddly, is schematic and disorganized at the same time: An extended discussion of the French Revolution appears in the chapter titled ''Medicine,'' as does a discursive talk about imperialism that draws heavily on the author's earlier writings.
As in his previous books, Mr. Ferguson does little to mute his own strong ideological views: He denounces Marx as ''an odious individual''; disdains what he calls ''a lumpenproletariat with vices'' like drinking gin and engaging in street fights; and emphasizes what he sees as the positive aspects of colonialism.
What keeps the reader pushing on through ''Civilization'' is the author's knack for making long-ago events as vivid and visceral as the evening news, for weaving anecdotes and small telling details together with a wide-angled retrospective vision.
For instance, Mr. Ferguson provides a concise and fascinating analysis of why the colonial origins of the United States and Latin America led to such different outcomes. In summary, he argues, ''North America was better off than South America purely and simply because the British model of widely distributed private property rights and democracy worked better than the Spanish model of concentrated wealth and authoritarianism.''
In another chapter he discusses how the Singer sewing machine (which ''completed the process of mechanizing clothes production'') helped promote the standardization of dress around the world, even as it helped increase American manufacturing productivity.
More important, Mr. Ferguson artfully uses his knowledge of economic history -- his book ''The Ascent of Money,'' which went to press in May 2008, shrewdly anticipated many aspects of the 2008 fiscal meltdown -- to analyze the bleak financial circumstances the West now finds itself in.
''Even in the late 1990s the West was still clearly the dominant civilization of the world,'' he writes. ''The five leading Western powers -- the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom, France and Canada -- accounted for 44 percent of total global manufacturing between them.'' The scientific world was dominated by Western universities; the Soviet Union had collapsed; a democratic wave was sweeping the world; and some scholars were declaring the triumph of liberal capitalism and dubbing the United States a ''hegemon.''
The financial disasters of 2008 and its continuing fallout; political partisanship and gridlock in the face of daunting problems; divisions within the United States and within the European Union; the overextension of American military forces in the wake of costly wars in Iraq and Afghanistan; and the rise of China: Is the West headed toward a fall like ancient Rome's?
''Such fears appear not altogether fanciful,'' Mr. Ferguson dourly observes, pointing out the role that fiscal crises, wars and political factionalism have played in the toppling of other dominant powers.
Even more alarmingly, he suggests that the collapses of great civilizations tend to come quickly. Rome, he writes, imploded ''within the span of a single generation''; ''the dramatic transition from Confucian equipoise to anarchy'' in Ming-era China ''took little more than a decade''; and the Soviet Union ''fell off a cliff -- rather than gently declining.'' Civilizations, he concludes, ''are highly complex systems, made up of a very large number of interacting components that are asymmetrically organized, so that their construction more closely resembles a Namibian termite mound than an Egyptian pyramid.''
''Such systems can appear to operate quite stably for some time,'' he goes on, ''apparently in equilibrium, in reality constantly adapting. But there comes a moment when they 'go critical.' A slight perturbation can set off a 'phase transition' from a benign equilibrium to a crisis -- a single grain of sand causes an apparently stable sandcastle to fall in on itself.''

HEADLINE: Tomorrow's Psychologists

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Intern Gap Frustrates Clinicians in Training'' (Nov. 8): I am former director of a newly defunct American Psychological Association-accredited internship program in upstate New York. In addition to the problems noted in the article, the harm caused by too few training programs has a ripple effect. For example, the cost-cutting and privatization threat that shut down our program significantly diminish the quality of care available to highly vulnerable populations. In addition, future patients throughout the area are adversely affected because internship programs like ours have historically ''seeded'' communities with psychologists who choose to stay in the locations where they trained. Fewer internship programs harm entire communities and not just the profession of psychology. 
A. Catherine DiNardo
New Paltz, N.Y.
To the Editor:
As this article rightly points out, the problem is not the matching program. It is the mismatch between the numbers of graduating students and available internship positions.
As Congress struggles to right the economy and balance the budget, its members would do well to rethink proposals aimed at cutting graduate medical education funding, lest they create a mismatch in medical education, making it impossible for thousands of newly trained physicians to obtain graduate training and ultimately practice medicine.
Thomas V. Whalen, M.D.
Allentown, Pa.
The writer is president of the National Resident Matching Program.
To the Editor:
There is no question that there is a serious shortage of internships available to clinical psychology graduate students. This shortage, however, is at least partly caused by American Psychological Association's refusal to acknowledge that there are hundreds of internships that provide excellent training but may not be accredited because they lack stipends and/or the funds to apply for accreditation. We have never seen data to support the notion that A.P.A. internships are somehow better than California Psychology Internship Council internships.

HEADLINE: After Madoff, a Greater Effort to Unearth Ponzi Schemes

BYLINE: By BEN PROTESS

 BODY:
Nearly three years after Bernard L. Madoff's gigantic fraud imploded, federal authorities say they are cracking down on Ponzi schemes in greater numbers.
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission brought 32 enforcement cases against suspected Ponzi schemes in its 2011 fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, a 45 percent increase from 2010 and a record high for the agency, according to data that will be released on Tuesday. In the same period, the Federal Bureau of Investigation opened more than 1,000 inquiries into possible Ponzi schemes, a roughly 150 percent increase from 2008, new figures show. 
''Ponzi schemes are one of our top priorities within financial crimes,'' Timothy A. Gallagher, the F.B.I.'s section chief for financial crimes, said. ''It's right up there with corporate fraud and insider trading.''
Regulators say their sharpened focus on Ponzi schemes, where firms pay bogus returns to investors using other clients' money, is because of heightened awareness from consumers and the weak state of the economy. Ponzi schemes rely on a steady inflow of fresh money, but when investors withdraw cash en masse, the schemes dry up.
The cases are rarely front-page news, and the architects of the schemes are usually not prominent names like Mr. Madoff's. But after Mr. Madoff's fraud went undetected for decades, which was an embarrassing blow to the Securities and Exchange Commission, regulators have quietly stepped up their scrutiny of small schemes.
Nearly a third of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's enforcement cases in the last year took aim at Ponzi schemes, cases that collectively totaled $279 million. The agency filed or won five cases in the last month alone.
''The data documents that this is a widespread and ever-present problem in America,'' said Bart Chilton, a Democratic commissioner at the agency. Mr. Chilton recently wrote a book, an educational publication for the agency - ''Ponzimonium: How Scam Artists Are Ripping Off America'' - to raise awareness about the prevalence of ''scamsters,'' he said. ''Consumers need to be on guard more than ever before.''
Last week, the agency filed a complaint against two brothers, Rodney Wagner and Roger Wagner, accusing them of using their Dallas church to recruit nearly 100 investors into a $5.5 million foreign exchange fund. The brothers, according to the complaint, boasted an attractive selling point: at least 200 percent returns.
Yet only a fraction of the customer money was actually deposited into trading accounts, and these accounts lost money, the agency said.
A lawyer for the brothers did not return a request for comment.
Regulators and securities lawyers attribute the surge in Ponzi scheme cases to a recent flood of consumer tips. Investors are more attuned to fraudulent funds, the experts say, after the public downfall of Mr. Madoff.
''In light of Madoff, they're sending the tips earlier,'' said Marc Litt, a lawyer at Baker & McKenzie and a former federal prosecutor who led the case against Mr. Madoff, resulting in a 150-year sentence. ''There's heightened scrutiny to these schemes and the damage they cause.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Far From Washington, Obama Defends His Policies

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
KAPOLEI, Hawaii -- President Obama will be far from Washington this week meeting with Pacific Rim allies, but on Sunday he weighed in on simmering domestic issues, warning Congressional Republicans that voters will turn them out if they do not pass some of his job-creation proposals.
Speaking at a press conference at the conclusion of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum here, Mr. Obama also defended his policies on Iran against assaults from Republican presidential candidates and boasted of those policies' support among foreign leaders. 
By his comments on job creation and deficit reduction, Mr. Obama sought to remain in the fray even as his foreign policy commitments -- two trade summits here and in Indonesia, and a visit to Australia in between to announce a security agreement -- keep him away from Washington.
Republicans ''don't seem to have that same sense of urgency about needing to put people back to work,'' he said, citing their opposition to his $447 billion package of tax cuts and spending for infrastructure projects and state aid to avert teacher layoffs.
Mr. Obama also called for Republicans on the special Congressional committee seeking $1.2 trillion in deficit reductions over 10 years to drop their opposition to raising some revenues from the wealthy -- to ''bite the bullet and do what needs to be done, because the math won't change.''
''If you want a balanced approach that doesn't gut Medicare and Medicaid, doesn't prevent us from making investments in education and basic science and research,'' he said, ''then prudent cuts have to be matched up with revenue.''
Now at an apparent impasse, the committee of six Democrats and six Republicans faces a Nov. 23 deadline -- four days after Mr. Obama returns -- to reach agreement. If it fails or falls short, automatic spending cuts will take effect in 2013, half of them from military programs, under the law creating the panel that the White House and Congressional leaders agreed to in August.
Republican leaders want to repeal the law's provision threatening the military reductions if Congress does not act. But Mr. Obama reiterated his opposition, recalling that the August deal provided for the automatic spending cuts -- known in budgeting jargon as a sequester -- as an incentive for both parties to compromise on alternative ways to reduce projected deficits.
''The whole idea of the sequester was to make sure that both sides felt obligated to move off rigid positions and do what was required to help the country,'' Mr. Obama said. He would not say whether he would veto a repeal measure ''until I actually see a bill.''
With polls suggesting broad support for the provisions in Mr. Obama's jobs package, the Republican-controlled House has countered by passing a number of measures it calls jobs bills. Most attack various federal regulations, in keeping with the party's anti-regulation principles, but economic forecasters say the measures would not spur consumer demand and thus job creation in the short term.
Ignoring the Republican bills, Mr. Obama said, ''Do I anticipate that at some point they recognize that doing nothing is not an option? That's my hope. And that should be their hope, too, because if they don't, I think we'll have a different set of leaders in Congress.''
On the issue of Iran and its suspected efforts to build nuclear weapons, Mr. Obama deflected a question about his inability here to win support from the presidents of China and Russia, Hu Jintao and Dmitri A. Medvedev, for tougher sanctions.
''Because of our diplomacy and our efforts, we have, by far, the strongest sanctions on Iran that we've ever seen. And China and Russia were critical to making that happen'' in the United Nations, he said.
Mr. Obama met separately with the Chinese and Russian presidents on the sidelines of the trade summit. ''All three of us entirely agree on the objective, which is making sure that Iran does not weaponize nuclear power and that we don't trigger a nuclear arms race in the region,'' he said.
The three leaders would consult further in the weeks ahead, he added, ''to look at what other options we have available to us'' diplomatically.
Administration officials had hoped that China and Russia would soften their resistance to additional sanctions given the recent report from the International Atomic Energy Agency of a ''credible'' case that Iran has been trying to develop a nuclear weapon.
Mr. Obama refused to respond directly to criticisms from Republican presidential candidates in their latest debate on Saturday -- in particular a statement from Mitt Romney, widely considered the Republican most likely to win his party's nomination, that ''if we re-elect Barack Obama, Iran will have a nuclear weapon.''
''I am going to make a practice of not commenting on whatever is said in Republican debates until they've got an actual nominee,'' Mr. Obama said.
''Now, is this an easy issue? No,'' he added. ''Anybody who claims it is is either politicking or doesn't know what they're talking about.''
Mr. Obama was asked about another issue raised at the Republicans' debate -- the contention by candidates Herman Cain and Michele Bachmann that ''waterboarding'' of suspected terrorists is not torture and should be used.
''They're wrong,'' he said.
Aside from the fact that the practice is ''contrary to our ideals,'' Mr. Obama said, ''We don't need it in order to prosecute the war on terrorism.''
On a topic removed from foreign or domestic policies, Mr. Obama elaborated on comments on Friday in California that the scandal at Pennsylvania State University should prompt a broader national soul-searching.
''For the alleged facts of that case to have taken place and for folks not to immediately say, nothing else matters except making sure those kids are protected, that's a problem,'' he said.
But the problem is ''not unique to a college sports environment,'' Mr. Obama added.
''All of us, I think, have occasion where we see something that's wrong, we've got to make sure that we step up,'' he said. ''That's true in college athletics. That's true in our government. That's true everywhere.''

HEADLINE: Students Lose Zeal for Aiding Obama Again

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY; Ian Lovett contributed reporting from Los Angeles, and Kim Palchikoff from Las Vegas.

 BODY:
LAS VEGAS -- For much of the presidential election of 2008, Barack Obama's campaign was Emma Guerrero's life. She was one of a dozen volunteers who showed up at an Obama campaign office here every night, taking time from her studies at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, to be part of what she still remembers as the most exciting period of her life.
It was largely because of Ms. Guerrero -- and hundreds of other college students like her across the country -- that Mr. Obama assembled a formidable machine that helped him roll to victory in 2008, a triumph that included putting Nevada into the Democratic column for the first time in 12 years.
''We did everything,'' she said. ''We went canvassing. Phone banking. Cleaning the offices. Taking out my bosses' dry cleaning. Whatever they needed. It was such an amazing time because we all believed and wanted him to get elected.'' 
Ms. Guerrero said that she did not blame Mr. Obama for the 13.4 percent unemployment rate that has gripped this state, and that she was still likely to vote for him. But as she looks to graduation this June and her job hunt ahead, the emotion she feels is fear, and she cannot imagine having the time or spirit to work for Mr. Obama.
''I don't think I could do it anymore,'' she said. ''That campaign was an amazing experience. But I don't think I'm in the same mind-set anymore. He hasn't really addressed the young people, and we helped him to get elected.''
Across this state -- and in others where young voters were the fuel of the Obama organization, voting for him two to one over John McCain -- the enthusiastic engine of the 2008 campaign has run up against the reality of a deadened job market for college students.
Interviews here and across the country suggest that most of his college supporters of 2008 are still inclined to vote for him. But the Obama ground army of 2008 is hardly ready to jump back into the trenches, potentially depriving Mr. Obama of what had been an important force in his victory.
Mr. Obama's advisers, while acknowledging the shift, said they were confident that the loss of these workers would be negated by an influx of new students who have turned of voting age since 2008. Mr. Obama's campaign manager, Jim Messina, said there had been eight million voters ages 18 to 21 registered since the last election, most of whom were Democrats.
''Their brothers and sisters started it, and they are going to finish it,'' Mr. Messina said Monday. ''They are storming into our office. Our volunteer numbers are up from where we thought they would be.''
Yet even Mr. Obama's supporters say it seems unlikely that the president -- given the difficulties of these past three years and the mood of the electorate of all ages -- will ever be able to replicate the youthful energy that became such a defining hallmark of his campaign. In the last election, Sandra Allen hosted a group of fellow Brown University students at her home to call voters in North Carolina and Indiana on Election Day, a common practice in the Obama campaign. Mr. Obama won those states to the shock of Republicans.
Asked if she would be doing similar work for Mr. Obama this time, Ms. Allen responded: ''Not now. And I will not be streaking across the main green of any campus with hundreds of thrilled people were he to be re-elected next year.''
Ms. Allen graduated last year and, after surveying the job market, decided to take refuge in graduate school to wait things out. ''I'm not optimistic,'' she said.
Jason Tieg, 22, a student at Brigham Young University-Idaho, voted for Mr. Obama with great enthusiasm in 2008. But now, struggling to find a part-time job to help him through school, he is not even sure he would do that again. ''I got a job in July as a custodian on campus, but I lost it again when they needed to cut down.''
''I don't know if I'll support him next year,'' he said.
It is hard to find a state that more vividly illustrates the danger to Obama from declining enthusiasm among young voters than Nevada. Few parts of the country have been harder hit by this recession, with stubborn double-digit unemployment, an unending wave of mortgage foreclosures and huge numbers of homeless. And there are few states where young voters were so crucial to Mr. Obama's victory.
Mark Triola, who was president of Young Democrats of Nevada in 2008, said at the time, the Democratic organization at U.N.L.V. was about three times as big as the Republican organization. By last year, he said, they were about equal, a trend that students there say has not changed this year. (For his part, Mr. Triola graduated in the spring and found a job in the communications industry -- ''ideally probably not what I was looking for, but I don't have any room to complain given what's going on,'' he said.)
Jolie Glaser, a gung-ho supporter of Mr. Obama in 2008 when she attended college at Stanford University, has taken to doing volunteer work for a children's cancer foundation as she looks for a job in the nonprofit sector. Her enthusiasm for the president has dampened.
''It's hard to be a passionate follower of him,'' she said. ''It's easier to be a thoughtful supporter.''
Sarah Farr, 20, a communications student, could devote endless energy to helping Mr. Obama as a student here four years ago. But now, with graduation approaching in 2013, she said that was the last thing she and her friends who also worked for him were contemplating.
''I don't have as much enthusiasm this time as I did last time,'' Ms. Farr said. ''Everybody is just focused on themselves and trying to get through school.''
''I'm scared that the major I'm getting won't be helpful in the future,'' she said. ''That terrifies me. I'm terrified that by the time I graduate, there won't be jobs. That's very nerve-racking.''
And even those who remain strongly supportive of Mr. Obama here say they see little chance of his winning this state.
''I don't think so, no,'' said Maureen Gregory, 23, a Las Vegas native who turned up at an interview at Madhouse Coffee loaded with buttons, T-shirts and posters from the campaign. ''People in Nevada are really angry. I think Nevada is going to be red again in 2012, definitely.''
In 2008 Ms. Gregory sneaked away from school every day to work at an Obama campaign headquarters. ''Sometimes I didn't get out until midnight,'' She said. She, too, could not imagine devoting that much time to him again, as much as she admires Mr. Obama.
''I didn't think it was going to be so bad,'' she said. ''I'm looking for something to do. Even part time. I was definitely hoping Obama could do more.''

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Nov. 15 about the waning enthusiasm of many young voters for President Obama's re-election campaign misidentified the university attended by Jolie Glaser at the time she campaigned for Mr. Obama in 2008. It is Stanford University, not the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. The article also described incorrectly a nonprofit organization for which she does volunteer work. The group, Candlelighters Childhood Cancer Foundation, is a children's cancer foundation that holds an annual golf tournament to raise money; Ms. Glaser does not do volunteer work at ''a golf charity.''

 Jolie Glaser said of Mr. Obama: ''It's hard to be a passionate follower of him. It's easier to be a thoughtful supporter.'' (PHOTOGRAPHS BY ISAAC BREKKEN FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES) (A18)

HEADLINE: Health Reform and the Supreme Court

 BODY:
The Supreme Court's decision to review the constitutionality of health care reform means it will be issuing a ruling in the middle of the 2012 presidential campaign. This can be a highly politicized court, and, for the public good and its own credibility, it must resist that impulse.
If the court follows its own precedents, as it should, this case should not be a close call: The reform law and a provision requiring most people to obtain health insurance or pay a penalty are clearly constitutional. 
The court agreed to hear appeals from a ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, which struck down the individual mandate to buy health insurance but left other parts of the law standing. Opponents of the law contend that Congress went beyond its authority in the reform measure. But Congress, under the commerce clause, plainly has the power to regulate the national health care market.
Almost everyone needs health care at some point, and if uninsured people are unable to pay steep medical bills they will get charity care that shifts the costs to others, whose insurance premiums go up to cover the cost of the free riders. There is no denying the health care market is interconnected and that individuals' decisions to purchase insurance -- or not -- affects the whole system.
Republican-appointed judges on two appellate courts have found the insurance mandate constitutional. They have cogently pointed out that past Supreme Court decisions have upheld federal laws that were much more intrusive on personal liberty and involved activities less clearly relevant to interstate commerce. These include rulings on laws that prohibit a farmer growing wheat for his own family's use and a woman growing marijuana for her own medicinal use. There is also no doubt that Congress has the authority to set minimum-wage rates and other laws that affect an individual's economic decisions. As Judge Laurence Silberman of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit wrote last weekin upholding the health reform law, ''the right to be free from federal regulation is not absolute, and yields to the imperative that Congress be free to forge national solutions to national problems, no matter how local -- or seemingly passive -- their individual origins.''
In addition to reviewing the mandate, the Supreme Court will also consider three other questions: whether other parts of the law are voided if the mandate is struck down; whether a decision must be put off until 2015 when the first penalties by noncompliant individuals would be paid; and whether Congress can require states to expand Medicaid programs in 2014.
If the justices were to strike down the mandate, they would have to consider whether that provision can be eliminated without excising some or all of the rest of the law. Without the mandate, it will be difficult for health insurers to accept all applicants and charge them premiums without regard to their health status. But there is no constitutional reason to strike down those other popular insurance reforms.
The reform law's expansion of Medicaid coverage to many individuals who are not now covered also has been challenged by the states as unconstitutional coercion because they claim to have no option but to comply. In rejecting that argument, the 11th Circuit noted that the federal government would bear most of the costs of the program's expansion. Moreover, it found that the states had ample powers to develop alternative programs if they want to drop out of Medicaid.
All of these issues are best resolved in the political system, not the courts. The Supreme Court ought to show judicial restraint, adhere to precedent and uphold the constitutionality of health care reform.

HEADLINE: As the Primary Campaign Grinds On, Romney's Team Prepares for Obama

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY and JIM RUTENBERG; Ashley Parker contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- As Mitt Romney prepares for Republican contests in Iowa, New Hampshire and beyond, his aides have been traveling the country filming stories for the battle they hope will follow against President Obama, spotlighting unemployed Americans who have given up on hope and change.
''We go to a lot of job fairs,'' said Stuart Stevens, a top adviser to Mr. Romney. ''You cannot spend a half-hour at a job fair and actually talk to people without having to leave because you'll start crying.''
Mr. Obama's campaign team has been gathering film of its own, documenting what Democrats say are Mr. Romney's shifting positions on an array of issues over the years. The White House, which is already sending aides and allies out to make a case that Mr. Romney has no core or principles other than trying to win office, is ready to unleash the assault at any time. Democrats have already run commercials against Mr. Romney in Iowa and Arizona and could release even more before the primary season begins. 
It is still seven weeks until Republican voters start getting their say in choosing from a wide field of candidates. But a stealth general election discussion is already under way, with the White House acting as if Mr. Romney will be the Republican nominee and Mr. Romney, for his own reasons, happy to assume the role and respond with an intense retort of his own.
The Romney campaign drew attention to the intensifying clash on Monday, suggesting that Mr. Obama and Democrats have an ''obsession'' with Mr. Romney. To amplify their point, they issued a statement that morphed the blue Obama campaign logo into the word ''Obsession.''
The candidates themselves engaged in one of their first direct exchanges over the weekend, with Mr. Romney asserting at a debate Saturday that Iran's progress toward developing a nuclear weapon represented Mr. Obama's ''greatest failing.'' Asked to respond on Sunday, Mr. Obama shot back that ''anyone who claims'' that containing Iran's ambitions is easy ''is either politicking or doesn't know what they're talking about.''
The back-and-forth provides an early look at how the two men intend to confront each other. While Mr. Romney relentlessly criticizes Mr. Obama for the sour state of the economy, his attacks are often almost genial in tone -- a recognition that many of the independent and moderate voters Mr. Romney hopes to win over like the president personally, but do not necessarily approve of his job in the Oval Office.
''David Axelrod says it's going to be an M.R.I. for the soul, '' said Mr. Stevens, referring to the way Mr. Obama's senior political strategist referred to the campaign process. ''This will be an M.R.I. of the president's record.''
By contrast, Mr. Obama and his advisers have signaled that they intend to try and use elements of Mr. Romney's background against him, particularly his time running Bain Capital. In a strategy that dovetails with the sharpening tenor of the president's populist message, they are likely to paint Mr. Romney as a plutocrat whose brand of capitalism would hurt the interests of the middle class at a moment when the country is increasingly focused on income inequality.
''Presidential races are, by definition, revealing,'' said Mr. Axelrod, who spends more time talking about Mr. Romney than about any other Republican candidate. ''You can try and craft your image, but whoever you are, people find out.''
The president and Mr. Romney have little personal history between them.
They had their first brief meeting in 2004 at the Gridiron Club dinner in Washington. They bumped into each other a few times on the campaign trail in 2007, aides said, and Mr. Obama called Mr. Romney when Ann Romney, his wife, was found to have cancer.
But they are now zeroing in on each other, previewing what the 2012 race will look like should Mr. Romney survive what are likely to be further twists in the primary contest. Mr. Romney's focus on Mr. Obama was on full display at Saturday's debate in South Carolina, when he took on the president's approach to Iran, China, Pakistan and, even, the United States' role in the world.
''We have a president right now who thinks America's just another nation,'' said Mr. Romney, who is testing new lines of attack most anywhere he goes. He has criticized Mr. Obama's ''Where's Waldo economy,'' for example, suggesting that the president has been an absent leader on the biggest issue facing the country, and he characterized the country's economic condition as the ''Obama Great Recession.''
Mr. Romney has been free to keep his focus on Mr. Obama because none of the other Republican candidates have been able to sustain much of an argument against him, to the great frustration of Mr. Obama's aides, who want to see Mr. Romney pummeled by his rivals during the primary season.
The easy treatment of Mr. Romney has also allowed him to avoid getting mired in promises to the far right wing of his party that could turn off independent voters in the general election. ''There's a little eye-rolling when we think a candidate missed an opportunity,'' said Brad Woodhouse, the Democratic National Committee spokesman.
So frustrated were Mr. Obama's aides after Mr. Romney emerged unscathed from yet another debate in mid-October that Mr. Axelrod called a news briefing to go after Mr. Romney himself, saying of Gov. Rick Perry of Texas -- then the Democrats' greatest hope to challenge Mr. Romney forcefully -- ''he hasn't exactly gotten his gun out of his holster.''
But Mr. Obama's aides were highly focused on Mr. Romney almost from the moment the Republican field took shape this summer.
The Democratic Party ran its first commercial against Mr. Romney in August, criticizing his public statement that ''corporations are people,'' in a spot it showed in Iowa.
The Democrats followed with another anti-Romney spot in Arizona in October, that time featuring his comments to The Las Vegas Review-Journal that the foreclosure process should be allowed to ''just run its course and hit bottom.''
Mr. Romney, whose Republican rivals could not afford to wage a major negative advertising blitz against him four years ago, has conserved his resources this time to push back what his advisers anticipate will be an attempt to erode his credibility.
Mr. Stevens said Mr. Romney's focus on Mr. Obama is as much about winning the nomination as about a general election campaign.
''From the very beginning this race has been about who can best articulate the case against Barack Obama,'' he said. ''Anyone who has deviated from that has suffered.''
Correction: November 16, 2011, Wednesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Tuesday about a shift in the Mitt Romney campaign to focus more on President Obama misstated the year they first met, at the Winter Gridiron Club Dinner in Washington. It was in December 2004, not 2005.

HEADLINE: Cain Stumbles in Assessing Foreign Policy

BYLINE: By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.; Michael D. Shear contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
Herman Cain became badly flustered on Monday when asked to assess President Obama's policy toward Libya, raising new questions about his command of foreign policy as he lurched over five minutes from awkward pauses to halting efforts to address the issue.
Video of Mr. Cain's appearance on Monday before editors and reporters at The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel went viral almost immediately after it was posted online, and drew immediate comparisons to Rick Perry's recent stumble in a debate when he froze in discussing which federal agencies he would eliminate. 
At the interview in Milwaukee, after he was asked his thoughts on Mr. Obama's handling of Libya, Mr. Cain leaned back and appeared to search for an answer: ''O.K., Libya,'' he said.
''President Obama supported the uprising, correct?'' he said. ''President Obama called for the removal of Qaddafi -- just want to make sure we're talking about the same thing before I say 'Yes, I agree,' or 'No, I didn't agree.' ''
Mr. Cain said he disagreed with the president's approach ''for the following reasons'' -- then changed course.
''Nope, that's a different one,'' he said. ''I've got to go back and see.''
He added: ''I've got all this stuff twirling around in my head.''
Some analysts have grown sharply critical of Mr. Cain's foreign policy pronouncements in debates and interviews, saying he shows a basic lack of understanding of critical regions of the world. Mr. Cain himself has sometimes fed into this, and in Monday's interview he said: ''Some people want to say, 'Well, as president, you're supposed to know everything.' No you don't.''
His comments about Libya came after a string of other provocative remarks about foreign policy and related issues.
Those include a statement published Monday in which Mr. Cain suggested that most American Muslims are extremists; a contradictory answer about waterboarding during a Republican presidential primary debate on Saturday focusing on foreign policy; and his statement that if Al Qaeda or another terrorist group demanded, he would consider authorizing the release of every detainee at Guantanamo Bay in return for the release of one American soldier.
J. D. Gordon, Mr. Cain's spokesman and national security adviser, said the candidate had not been at his sharpest in Milwaukee because of a lack of sleep amid a long day of traveling.
''We were all going on four hours sleep, so he was tired,'' Mr. Gordon said in a telephone interview. ''When he got the Libya question, it took him a while to get his bearings on it, but he got the answer right.''
Mr. Gordon said Mr. Cain did repeat several times what he said was the correct answer -- that the Obama administration should have done a better job assessing the Libyan opposition to Qaddafi and how it would govern.
Even on this point, though, Mr. Cain seemed to contradict himself at the end of the interview, when he said, ''I don't know that they were or were not assessed.''
Daniel Drezner, a professor of international politics at the Fletcher School at Tufts University, was unforgiving in a post on his blog at foreignpolicy.com.
''There's a mercy rule in Little League, and I'm applying it here -- unless and until Herman Cain surges back in the polls again, or manages to muster something approaching cogency in his foreign policy statements, there's no point in blogging about him anymore,'' Mr. Drezner wrote. ''I can only pick on an ignoramus so many times before it feels sadistic.''
Jamie Fly, executive director of the Foreign Policy Initiative, said Mr. Cain's answer was further argument for additional foreign policy debates by the candidates.
''Past presidents have often been tested very early in their terms,'' Mr. Fly said. ''We elect a president solely on an economic rationale at our own peril.''
In the Cain comments about Muslims that were released on Monday, he told GQ magazine he believed that most American Muslims held ''extremist views,'' explaining that a ''Muslim voice'' he knows -- whom he would not name -- told him that was the case.
''I have had one very well-known Muslim voice say to me directly that a majority of Muslims share the extremist views,'' Mr. Cain said.
Though the transcript indicates Mr. Cain explicitly said he was talking about Muslims in the United States, Mr. Gordon said Mr. Cain had actually been talking about those in another country. ''He doesn't believe most Muslims in America have extreme views,'' Mr. Gordon said.
Mr. Gordon said some other criticisms of Mr. Cain's foreign policy comments had been unfair.
He also said that Mr. Cain had been spending anywhere from 10 minutes to several hours a day boning up on national security issues, including conversations with some ambassadors, and that he had spoken to the first President Bush and former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger.
''It's frankly just a lot of stuff to know in a little bit of time,'' he said.

HEADLINE: UBS Names Sergio Ermotti as Chief Executive

BYLINE: JULIA WERDIGIER


HIGHLIGHT: The Swiss bank said Sergio P. Ermotti, who has run UBS on an interim basis since September, would become permanent chief executive and take the reins of a strategic restructuring. 

 BODY:
LONDON - UBS has chosen Sergio P. Ermotti, who has run the Swiss bank on an interim basis since September, to become its permanent chief executive.
Axel A. Weber, a former chief of the German central bank, will take over as chairman next year, a year earlier than planned, UBS said on Tuesday.
The bank accelerated the leadership change to speed up its new strategy, which UBS is expected to present to investors on Thursday in New York.
"The bank has a lot of restructuring to do and as interim C.E.O. with a chairman on his way out there's little you can actually do," said Florian Esterer, a fund manager at Swisscanto Asset Management. "This way UBS can slowly start moving forward."
Mr. Ermotti, a Swiss national, joined UBS as management board member responsible for Europe in April and was widely seen as a potential successor to the former chief executive, Oswald J. Grubel. Mr. Ermotti stepped into that role on an interim basis when Mr. Grubel resigned in September after the bank lost $2.3 billion in a rogue trading scandal at its London investment banking division.
The changes "will bring essential stability and clarity to UBS," Kaspar Villiger, the current chairman, said in a statement. "It will enable the bank to master the many current economic challenges and regulatory changes facing it." He said the decision to make Mr. Ermotti the permanent chief came after UBS "carried out an intensive evaluation of external and internal candidates."
Some analysts expressed doubts that UBS could find an outside candidate willing to take on the challenges at the bank, which is facing large job and cost cuts and needs to restore investor confidence after the trading loss.
UBS shares fell 2.9 percent in Zurich trading on Tuesday.
In his first internal note to employees as chief executive, Mr. Ermotti warned that the UBS culture must ensure that events like the trading loss did not happen again. "I want to make clear that no one's personal interest nor any amount of revenue is worth more than the bank's reputation," he wrote in the note.
A former UBS trader, Kweku M. Adoboli, is scheduled to appear in a London court next week to face charges of fraud and false accounting. He has yet to enter a plea.
Mr. Ermotti, 51, joined UBS in April from the Italian bank UniCredit, where he was deputy chief executive. He previously worked at Merrill Lynch, where he was a co-head of global equity markets. He started at the firm's equity derivatives and capital markets divisions in 1987.
UBS said a new strategy, which is expected to include a smaller and less expensive investment banking operation and a greater focus on the more successful wealth management business, had been approved by the board.
The strategy was developed by Mr. Grubel and Carsten Kengeter, the head of the investment banking unit, to help UBS remain profitable despite tougher capital requirements and uncertain financial markets. It is now Mr. Ermotti's responsibility to put the plan into action, and he told employees on Tuesday that he "will not rest until we succeed."
"I will execute our strategy, which plays to our many strengths," he said in a statement. "This strategy will be centered on our leading wealth management businesses and our position as the strongest universal bank in Switzerland. A focused, less complex and less capital-intensive investment bank and our asset management business are also key elements for growing our wealth management franchise."
Mr. Weber's appointment as chairman is subject to his election by shareholders at the annual meeting scheduled for May 3. Mr. Villiger, the current chairman, will not be a candidate for election at the meeting.
"I am proud of what we have achieved during a very difficult time in our bank's history," Mr. Villiger said.
Mr. Weber said he would head to Switzerland in February to oversee the handover. He also said he knew Mr. Ermotti personally from his time at the German central bank and that the two men had spoken often over the last few weeks.

HEADLINE: Amid New Lawsuits, Prospects Weaken for 2012 Baltimore Grand Prix

BYLINE: ROY FURCHGOTT


HIGHLIGHT: The company that produced the inaugural race has not paid fees to the city of Baltimore, the state of Maryland or its former counsel, according to recently filed court papers. 

 BODY:
BALTIMORE -- Drivers, race officials, broadcasters, government agencies and local businesses were nearly unanimous in their praise for the inaugural Baltimore Grand Prix, held over Labor Day weekend this year on the streets around the city's Inner Harbor.
But as lawsuits and debt claims mount against Baltimore Racing Development, the company that produced and promoted the 2011 event capped by an IndyCar race won by Will Power, the 2012 race weekend remains in question.
Baltimore officials have threatened to cancel next year's race unless, by Dec. 31, the promoter settled debts to the city totaling $1.5 million. Meanwhile, allegations of mismanagement and dishonesty among company officials have surfaced, and its chief executive has stepped down.
"Baltimore Racing Development has not honored the terms of its contract with the city," said Kaliope Parthemos, deputy mayor for economic and neighborhood development, in a statement last week. "B.R.D. must immediately restructure and recapitalize or sell itself to investors in order to make the event profitable in the future."
City Hall is owed for city services, taxes, fees and parking, Ms. Parthemos said.
The city has also demanded that the company work to pay other vendors and present "a restructured company and management team," or the city will terminate its contract.
When reached by telephone, city officials declined to comment beyond the written statement released last week. Repeated calls and e-mails from Wheels for comment from company officials were not answered.
Maryland's Stadium Authority also moved to recover a portion of funds owed for building pit lanes, which was to be paid into an escrow account. Michael Frenz, executive director of the authority, said in a telephone interview that the company owed $1.6 million, including interest, to the authority, but that no direct payments were due until the end of next year's race, according to the contract.
Mr. Frenz said that negotiations were under way with the company to secure the escrow repayment, which totaled $470,000.
"Ideally we would like them to do it tomorrow, but know it's not possible," he said. "In the event they are not able to do it in what we consider a reasonable amount of time, we are exploring what our options might be."
Among the vendors identified in the statement from City Hall who were due payment were B&K Rentals, which built grandstands;, and Robert Roman, the father-in-law of Jay Davidson, the former chief executive of Baltimore Racing Development.
The company had previously been sued by Steven Wehner, a company founder and shareholder, who initially convinced city and racing authorities to bring a grand prix competition to downtown. Mr. Wehner asserted that he was due a lump payment of $750,000, including interest and lawyers' fees, which was set off when the company defaulted on an agreement to buy a portion of his share in the organization.
Meanwhile, though Mr. Davidson had stepped down, he remained with the organization in an undefined role. According to a report in The Baltimore Sun, Felix Dawson, the former chief executive of Constellation Energy Partners, wasbeing considered for the position.
"I have not met the man, I just know of his qualifications," said Terry Angstadt, president of the Indy Racing League's commercial division, which sanctioned the event, in a telephone interview.
IndyCar, meanwhile, has been pressing for a reorganization of Baltimore Racing Development in the interest of continuing the grand prix.
"When things don't go as everyone would like, it tarnishes the IndyCar brand," Mr. Angstadt said. "We take that very seriously."

HIGHLIGHT: The 2013 Ford Mustang Shelby GT500 has the world's most powerful production V-8 engine. 

 BODY:
In which we bring you motoring news from around the Web:
 On Tuesday, Ford announced details of its refreshed 2013 Mustang line, including the range-topping Shelby GT500. The previous car's 5.4-liter V-8 has grown to 5.8 liters, and power has increased from 540 to 650 horsepower. Ford asserts that the revised engine is the most powerful production V-8 in the world, and despite the heightened output, the car manages to avoid a gas-guzzler tax. It is also the first production Mustang with a top speed in excess of 200 miles per hour. The outgoing car cost roughly $50,000; pricing has not been announced for the revised Shelby, which is scheduled to be displayed at the Los Angeles auto show on Wednesday. (Ford)
 The outward growth of the Prius nameplate continues, with the Toyota's announcement Tuesday that its Prius C hatchback would have its debut at the Detroit auto show in January. The C, which is nearly 20 inches shorter over all than the traditional Prius but only six inches shorter between the axles, is powered by a 1.5-liter, 4-cylinder and the company's Hybrid Synergy Drive system. Toyota estimated that the C would receive a fuel-economy rating in city driving of more than 50 miles per gallon. It is scheduled to go on sale next spring at a price lower than that of the traditional Prius, though pricing was not announced Tuesday. The subcompact hatch was previewed in concept form at Detroit earlier this year. (Toyota)
 Mercedes-Benz revealed photos and specifications for its ML63 AMG on Monday. The S.U.V., which is scheduled to be shown at the Los Angeles auto show on Wednesday, is powered by a downsized version of the brand's V-8, displacing 5.5 liters but producing 518 horsepower and 516 pound-feet of torque, an increase of 15 horsepower and 44 pound-feet of torque over the outgoing version. An optional AMG performance package raises those specifications to 550 horsepower and 550 pound-feet of torque, as well as the limited top speed, to 174 m.p.h. (Automobile)
 The owner of a Chrysler Town & Country minivan that he bought in 2010 from a used-car dealer in Santa Clara, Calif., recently discovered that the van had 19 kilograms of cocaine tucked in its door panels and above the rear wheels. He had taken it to a repair shop because the windows would not go down entirely, which prompted a technician to remove the door panel. Police estimated the street value of the drugs at about $500,000. After the discovery, the owner encountered resistance at the dealership, which would offer to only exchange the vehicle for a model based on the van's current value, not the purchase price. But the dealer eventually acquiesced. (The San Jose Mercury News)
 Better Place, the electric-vehicle infrastructure company, announced recently that it raised $200 million in series C financing. The privately held company expects to use the money to establish a presence in urban markets in Western Europe. Better Place demonstrated its first battery-swapping station in Israel over the summer and expected to have it online, as well as one outside Copenhagen, Denmark and another in Canberra, Australia, early next year. The company also has announced intentions to build swap stations in North America, China and Japan. The only E.V. marketed to consumers that is compatible with the swap stations is the Renault Fluence Z.E. sedan. (Better Place)

HEADLINE: The Balanced Budget Amendment Delusion

BYLINE: BRUCE BARTLETT


HIGHLIGHT: In promoting a balanced budget amendment, Republicans are turning their back on policies that produced balanced budgets previously, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
This week the House of Representatives will take up a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. An idea that has been kicking around for ages, it has never overcome the hurdle of needing a two-thirds approval vote in both houses of Congress. (After which it would not require the president's signature but would need to be ratified by three-quarters of the states to take effect.)
The concept of balancing the budget annually is a bad idea but not an unreasonable one. However, the idea of mandating a balanced budget through the Constitution is dreadful. And the proposal that Republican leaders plan to bring up is, frankly, nuts.
The Founding Fathers took the necessity of balancing the federal budget to be self-evident - with no need to mandate it because economic circumstances severely constrained the government's ability to spend more than taxes covered.

The memory of the hyperinflation of the War of Independence was fresh, and people were rightly concerned that deficits would lead to the printing of money to cover budgetary shortfalls, restarting inflation. Moreover, the domestic capital market was virtually nonexistent during the early years of the republic, and all Americans were wary of borrowing from abroad unless absolutely necessary.
Consequently, the budget was usually balanced for the nation's first 150 years, except during wartime, and strenuous efforts were made to pay down the debt as soon as hostilities ended. This budgetary norm didn't change until the 1930s, when economic stagnation and widespread deprivation made balancing the budget impossible. Also, the economic theories of John Maynard Keynes became popular and argued that large deficits would be necessary to restore growth.
Conservatives view the adoption of Keynesian economics as original sin, opening the door to a vast expansion of government. Instead of being paid for with politically unpopular tax increases or spending cuts, new spending programs were to a large extent financed with seemingly costless deficits. The economist James Buchanan called this "fiscal illusion."
He had a point. We would have less spending if its tax cost was fully apparent. If people knew their taxes would go up or they would lose government benefits whenever spending increased, we would have a lot less spending.
Unfortunately, conservatives intentionally destroyed the remnants of the implicit balanced budget constraint in the 1970s so they could cut taxes without having to cut spending at the same time. Finding enough spending cuts to pay for big tax cuts would have doomed their efforts, so they concocted a theory, "starve the beast," to maintain a fig leaf of fiscal responsibility.
Under this theory, deficits are intentionally created by tax cuts, which puts political pressure on Congress to cut spending. Thus, cutting taxes without cutting spending became the epitome of conservative fiscal policy. Unfortunately, it didn't work.
We gave starve-the-beast theory a test during the Reagan administration, but as I have shown previously, when push came to shove, Reagan was always willing to raise taxes rather than allow deficits to get out of control.
We gave starve-the-beast theory another test during the George H.W. Bush and Clinton administrations. They both raised taxes and, according to the theory, this should have caused spending to rise, because tax increases feed the beast. But they didn't. Spending as a share of the gross domestic product fell to 18.2 percent in 2000 from 22.3 percent in 1991, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
We gave starve-the-beast theory another test during the George W. Bush administration. Taxes were slashed, but spending rose - again, the exact opposite of what the theory said should have happened. The economist Bill Niskanen asserted that the result was not surprising because the Republican position on taxes effectively reduced the tax cost of spending.
Nevertheless, conservatives like Grover Norquist insist that starve-the-beast theory works, which is why they relentlessly push for still more tax cuts despite the obvious failure of previous tax cuts either to stimulate economic growth or restrain spending, and oppose even the most trivial tax increases no matter how big the deficit.
Historically, one problem conservatives had with a straightforward balanced budget requirement was a concern that it might lead to tax increases. It would also make further tax cuts more difficult to achieve.
Today, most conservatives support a constitutional requirement that will only restrain spending but make tax increases effectively impossible, while continuing to permit tax cuts regardless of the deficit. This is the essence of the "balanced budget" amendment that Republicans plan to vote on.
The amendment reported by the House Judiciary Committee in June would limit federal spending to 18 percent of "economic output" (whatever that is) without a three-fifths vote in both the House and Senate and would require a two-thirds vote to raise taxes. The latter requirement is even more stringent than it appears because it applies to the full membership of both houses, not just the percentage of those present and voting. Taxes, on the other hand, can be cut with a simple majority vote.
Space prohibits a full discussion of all the technical problems with this poorly drafted amendment. A July 8 report from the Congressional Research Service does a good job of going through some of them.
These include the fact that gross domestic product is nowhere defined in law, nor could it be because it is a continually evolving concept; 18 percent of G.D.P. is a totally arbitrary figure that couldn't be achieved this year even with the abolition of every federal program other than Social Security, Medicare, national defense and interest on the debt, because the deficit is twice as large as total nondefense discretionary spending.
Outlays would actually have to be well below 18 percent of G.D.P. in practice because future spending is held to 18 percent of the previous fiscal year's G.D.P., and there is no practical way of enforcing the amendment through the federal courts. For more details, see my July 11 article in Tax Notes magazine.
The truth is that Republicans don't care one whit about actually balancing the budget. If they did, they would want to return to the policies that gave us balanced budgets in the late 1990s.
The crucial one was higher taxes, which virtually all Republicans opposed in 1990 and 1993, and budget controls that prevented tax cuts unless offset dollar-for-dollar with cuts in entitlement programs, which Republicans abandoned in 2002 so they could cut taxes without constraint.
Of course, no Republican favors such policies today. They prefer to delude voters with pie-in-the-sky promises that amending the Constitution will painlessly solve all our budget problems.

HEADLINE: Carbon Trading Initiative a Success, Study Says

BYLINE: MATTHEW L. WALD


HIGHLIGHT: A study estimates that the 10 states in the regional initiative will realize $1.6 billion from a three-year period in which the cap-and-trade market operated. 

 BODY:
The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a 10-state program that has been testing a carbon dioxide cap-and-trade system, may be in trouble, with New Jersey planning to drop out and other states considering doing the same. 
But a new study says the program has saved money for consumers, stimulated job growth and kept money in local economies in the states that signed up. 
Power plant owners paid in $912 million over the period studied, from mid-2008 through September. Some of it was spent on projects like improving energy efficiency, some went to unrelated environmental purposes like restoring wetlands and some simply went into general use by the states. 
The 10 states within the program, known as RGGI (pronounced Reggie) are the six New England states, New York, New Jersey, Maryland and Delaware. 
The study, paid for by four nonprofit foundations and carried out by the Analysis Group, a Boston-based consulting firm, found that the regional economy would gain more than $1.6 billion from actions taken under the initiative in the period studied. The figure represents the value of future savings as the energy efficiency benefits are realized. Three-quarters of it would come from savings in electricity, natural gas and heating oil bills.
Companies that make electricity from coal and natural gas raised their asking price for power. That pushed up the market price for electricity, so companies that made electricity from wind, sun and uranium also received a higher price for their output in auctions in the power markets. But the latter companies did not see any increase in expenses, so their profits rose, the study said.

The study also cited a benefit that would accrue to a regional pilot effort but not to a nationwide program: fuel use dropped, and since none of the states involved produces much fuel, the money stayed there. 
Expenses were higher for New Jersey, Maryland and Delaware because their electric system uses more coal. 
But the period covered was one involving radical changes in the electricity market, some of which made the effects of the greenhouse gas imitative harder to discern, according to some experts. The price of natural gas collapsed, allowing gas to take market share from coal. That was a trend that imposing costs on carbon dioxide emissions was supposed to encourage since a coal plant emits about twice as much carbon dioxide as a natural gas plant. 
The greenhouse gas initiative, though, turned out to be piggybacking on a larger economic force, the relative price of fuels. 
The carbon charges helped make electricity slightly more expensive than it would otherwise have been, about 0.7 percent higher, a factor that was intended to drive down demand and encourage conservation. But the price of electricity was falling over the period anyway, and demand was way down because of the recession. 
The national demand for electricity declined in 2008 and 2009, a very rare occurrence, and while it picked up a bit in 2010, it is still not back to 2007 levels.
Popular sentiment now seems to be running against carbon controls.
Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey announced in May that he would of the 10-state compact by the end of this year. Carbon allowances were sold every three months, he said, but the allowances "were never expensive enough to change behavior as they were intended to."
When the program was envisioned, the economy was strong and experts expected that the right to emit a ton of carbon dioxide would sell for $20 to $30, but it never got above the low single-digits. 
Lawmakers in New Hampshire voted to pull their state out of the program, but the governor . Legislation to withdraw Delaware died in committee. 
New York's participation is the subject of a State Supreme Court challenge. 
One of the report's authors, Susan F. Tierney, a former utility regulator in Massachusetts and onetime assistant secretary for policy at the federal Energy Department, said that while changes in the energy economy had made the effects of the initiative less obvious, the program yielded benefits and would have done so regardless of the state of the energy market. 
The benefit was from improving energy efficiency, which states used at least some of the money to accomplish, she said. "Rational people leave money on the table with energy efficiency," Dr. Tierney said.
When states run an efficiency programs, they can overcome a variety of economic barriers -- like a landlord who picks a cheap but inefficient refrigerator that runs on electricity that the tenant pays for -- in a way that pure economic incentive cannot, she said. She called it "a cost-effective societal use of money."
The study found, however, that some of the money went to purposes unrelated to energy.

HEADLINE: On the Soccer Field, a Roster Full of Refugees

BYLINE: COREY KILGANNON


HIGHLIGHT: A league affiliated with the United Nations provides a welcome respite for refugees from oppression and turmoil. 

 BODY:
 In a Wednesday night league held on Roosevelt Island, the sidelines are clearly marked, but the games are very much without borders.
This is especially true for the refugee team that plays in this United Nations soccer league made up of players who work at the U.N. 
The refugee team is fielded by the International Rescue Committee, a nongovernmental international relief organization that works with immigrants fleeing oppression. The refugee team has six players who have come in recent months from countries including Guinea, Mauritania and Sierra Leone.
 There was also Tara Gurung, 18, an ethnic Bhutanese man who spent years in a refugee camp in Nepal. Playing on a recent Wednesday night, he roamed the midfield, quick as a jack rabbit, and hungrily chased down the ball.
There was Basim Mghamis, 24, at forward, who fled war-torn Iraq as a teenager and lived in several countries before coming to New York last year. Defending the goal was Shafiq Haidari, 28, who fled the Taliban in Afghanistan and came to the United States in July.
"It's something we can all play together," said Mr. Haidari, of the soccer competition.
The rest of the team this night -- the games are played with seven players on each side -- was made up of committee staff members and volunteers. The on-field roster varies week to week, since most of the refugees hold jobs with long hours and unusual shifts. 
The team is not exactly eating up the competition - it has lost all of its seven games so far - but the players do work well together, despite many of the refugees' limited English.
"The common thing here is soccer; they each know how to play and where to go with it," said Vanessa Pirandello, a communications coordinator for the committee, which is based in Midtown Manhattan. "The team is an attempt to reconnect them to a sport they all love and reconnect them to other people in New York City. This is the United Nations league, and our team is a little United Nations in itself."
 For some players, the league is their first opportunity to play soccer since arriving in the United States and a return to something normal and carefree, Ms. Pirandello said as she walked the sidelines and cheered for the refugee players.
 Also watching was the league president, Alvaro Calderon.
 "The team is an example of one of our goals, bringing people together and creating friendship through sport," said Mr. Calderon, who recently retired as a librarian in the U.N. library. Each year, he said, league officials pick an all-star team for a World Cup, of sorts, of United Nations teams all over the world.
 The league runs from September through December. There are 16 teams in the league and they have names like the Balkan Express, U.N. Security, Unicef and Peace United. In its early years, the league played its games on Randall's Island and had many high-level players, including Rich Chinapoo, a fullback from Trinidad who played for Long Island University in Brooklyn and went on to play for the New York Cosmos in the early 1980s.
Next to the game involving the team with refugees was another match between a Serbian team and a squad of security guards from the United Nations. Sometimes diplomatic complexities disrupt a team's schedule, Mr. Calderon said. For example, the security team loses some of its key players when they have to travel to help guard the secretary general.
The games are held on a field of artificial turf next to the East River. On this night, the river was dark and glassy and running swiftly southward toward New York Harbor. Big, black tankers slipped by, in front of the Manhattan skyline, seemingly within kicking distance. At one point, a shot toward the refugee team's goal went wide and the ball sailed into the river and was swept away by the current.
The International Rescue Committee helps people uprooted or affected by violence and oppression. It provides emergency relief and resettlement services. It helped Mr. Haidari, for example, get settled in Flushing, Queens, where there are many Afghani immigrants.
Mr. Haidari entered the game as the goaltender but was momentarily confused about what jersey to wear. Teammates on the sideline yelled at him to come over and put on a jersey, but the other team - Millennium, which had largely Latin American and Caribbean players -- was headed down field toward him, on attack.
"What to do?" he yelled, in confusion. He grabbed the jersey and pulled it on, and then blocked a barrage of shots.
Mr. Mghamis said he fled his home in Karbala, Iraq, in 2005, as a teenager and lived in Lebanon before coming to New York in 2009. He now lives in the Grand Concourse section of the Bronx and works at a bakery near his home.
He took off his cleats after the game and said, "In my country, we are born with soccer, so it feels good to play it again."

HEADLINE: Why Is the U.S. on the 'Wrong Track?

BYLINE: CHARLES M. BLOW


HIGHLIGHT: Three quarters of the population agrees that we're headed the wrong way, but they don't agree about why. 

 BODY:
Woe is us.
That's the general mood that comes through when people are asked about the direction of the country. Overwhelming numbers believe that we are headed in the wrong direction.
But why? The quick answer is that the economy is sour and that's a huge drag on national confidence. That's the conventional wisdom.
But the results of a Politico/George Washington University Battleground Poll of likely voters released Monday make that conventional wisdom itself seem off track.
First, the standard question is posed: "Now, thinking for a moment about things in the country, do you feel things in the country are going in the right direction, or do you feel things have gotten off on the wrong track?"
Seventy-five percent answered that the country was somewhat or strongly on the wrong track. Predictable.
But then came this follow-up question: "And, being as specific as you can, why do you think the country is on the wrong track?"
Here are people's answers:
While the economy commands the top spots, I was a bit surprised by how few people mentioned it at all. Taken together, jobs and the economy were only mentioned by 23 percent of respondents.
Far more interesting to me were the reasons given farther down the list. My mind immediately made a parlor game of grouping them to get a sense of political leanings.
I see some clear Tea Party threads and some clear Occupy Wall Street ones.
What do you think? Is the country on the right or wrong track? And why? How would you group the answers given above?
I for one would make sure that every category I dreamed up included the statement, "the country is in a mess."

HEADLINE: Moving the Movement: Analyzing the Future of Occupy Wall Street

BYLINE: SARAH KAVANAGH, KATHERINE SCHULTEN and HOLLY EPSTEIN OJALVO


HIGHLIGHT: In this lesson, students react to current news, examine their own feelings about the movement, read an Opinion piece about its role in history, and do an analysis of "Occupy's" strengths and weaknesses to make predictions about its future. 

 BODY:
Overview | What is the current status of the Occupy Wall Street movement? What effects has it had so far, and where is it going from here? In this lesson, students react to current news, read an Opinion piece about its role in history, and do an analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the movement to make predictions about its future. 
Note to Teacher | This lesson involves students exploring and expressing their political views. Please establish ground rules that will allow for the full range of views expressed to be welcomed and heard, and permit students to keep their opinions to themselves if they are not comfortable sharing them with the group.
Materials | Student journals, computer with Internet access and projector.
Warm-Up | Ask students what they have heard about Occupy Wall Street, also sometimes known merely as "Occupy," or "OWS," and jot ideas on the board. Next, show the slide show that goes with the article "Police Clear Zuccotti Park of Protesters." Discuss what the photos depict and what happened when the police moved into the park. Explain that Zuccotti Park is located near Wall Street in Manhattan, and that it was the initial location of what has become an movement in numerous cities and college campuses around the United States and around the world. (The Times Topics page on Occupy Wall Street has a lengthier overview if needed.)
Point out, if students have not done so, that police have cracked down on Occupy encampments in other places, including in Oakland, Calif. 
What questions does this latest news raise for them? Jot students' responses on the board. What do the protesters want? Note that though their grievances are generally about the financial system, income inequality and a sense that the poor and middle class have been disenfranchised, protesters have not made specific demands. 
Tell students that they will now express their views on the movement, regardless of how extensive their background knowledge may be. They will be using their journals to "take a stand" based on their feelings, values and impressions, but will not need to share these with others unless they choose to.
Tell students open their journals and make a chart with five columns and five rows, labeling the columns Strongly Disagree, Disagree, Neutral, Agree, Strongly Agree and the rows Strongly Oppose, Oppose, Neutral, Support, Strongly Support. 
Explain to the class that you will read aloud five statements. Upon hearing the first statement, they should mark the box that best represents both how much they agree or disagree about the movement's main goals (the columns) and the extent to which they support or oppose the methods that have been used by the protesters (the rows).
They should mark each box with the number of the statement they are responding to. After they have marked a box, they should jot down some notes about why they chose the boxes that they did. Continue the process through the remaining statements. 
The statements are as follows:
1. Income inequality has contributed to the country's problems.
2. Congress has contributed to the country's problems.
3. The White House has contributed to the country's problems.
4. Large banks have contributed to the country's problems.
5. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have contributed to the country's problems.
After the exercise is over, have students write about their choices in their journals, or discuss as a class, using the following questions: Which boxes did you find yourself going to most often? Why might that be? How would you summarize your stance on the Occupy Wall Street Movement at this point? Why do you feel that way? What do you need to know or understand in order to solidify your views one way or the other? 
Update | Nov. 16: We now have a Student Opinion question that we will leave open to which you can invite your students to post: Do You Sympathize With the Occupy Wall Street Movement?
To place these decisions in some context, share with students the Times interactive feature "Public Opinion and the Occupy Movement," on which Times readers placed themselves on a similar grid in response to the same five statements.
Ask: What similarities do you notice between the Times feature and your own chart? What differences? Are you surprised by the similarities and differences? Why or why not? A recent New York Times/CBS News poll found that almost half of the public thinks the views of the Occupy activists generally reflect the views of most Americans. Why do they think that might be? After this exercise, would they include themselves in that group or not? 
Related | The Sunday Review Op-Ed "The New Progressive Movement" examines the potential future of the Occupy Wall Street movement by comparing the movement to past progressive eras in American history:
Occupy Wall Street and its allied movements around the country are more than a walk in the park. They are most likely the start of a new era in America. Historians have noted that American politics moves in long swings. We are at the end of the 30-year Reagan era, a period that has culminated in soaring income for the top 1 percent and crushing unemployment or income stagnation for much of the rest. The overarching challenge of the coming years is to restore prosperity and power for the 99 percent.
Read the entire article with your class, using the questions below.
Questions | For discussion and reading comprehension: 

        
What evidence does the writer, Jeffrey D. Sachs, offer to support his claim that the Occupy Wall Street movement might be marking the start of a new era in American history?
        
Do you think the author's argument is controversial? What arguments do you think could be made to counter his claims?
        
What similarities does the author offer between contemporary economic realities and those of past eras?
        
What does the author believe the Occupy Wall Street Movement should focus on moving forward? Do you agree? Why or why not?
        
How would you characterize the main argument of this author? Do you think he offers enough evidence to support his claims? Why or why not? Do you agree with him? Why or why not?
Activity | At this point in the lesson, there are many directions you could take for deeper inquiry. 
You may wish to move directly to a SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) analysis of the Occupy movement overall (detailed below); choose a movement or time period from the related article to explore as a comparison; examine the decisions to clear the encampments in Zuccotti Park and Oakland, focusing on the tactics by protesters and police, the government's decision and Americans' Constitutional rights; or skim our Oct. 11 lesson on Occupy Wall Street for still more ideas that can be adapted to the latest news. 
To begin the SWOT analysis, tell students that they will work in groups to analyze the Occupy movement and then make predictions about its future. Explain that the acronym SWOT stands for "Strengths," "Weaknesses," "Opportunities" and "Threats." These categories are areas of analysis that businesses and not-for-profit organizations use to determine their internal strengths and weaknesses and their external opportunities and threats for strategic planning purposes. This form of analysis can also be applied to departments or branches of larger institutions, as well as to individuals within these institutions.
If desired and time permits, delve a bit further into how SWOT analyses are performed. You can also see our previous lesson plans using the SWOT format, like one from the 2010 midterm elections ora 2007 lesson on China's readiness for the Beijing Olympics.
Create a chart like this one, with four boxes, labeled "Strengths," "Weaknesses," "Opportunities" and "Threats," on the board. Inform students that they will be working in groups to fill in their own SWOT chart for the Occupy Wall Street Movement, but that the whole class will work together to come up with a few initial ideas before breaking up into smaller groups.
You may wish to model the process using the latest reporting you can find, though students will be digging deeper in small groups. For example, using this Nov. 15 Times article, you might add the line "The [Nov. 15 police operation] in and around the park struck a blow to the Occupy Wall Street movement, which saw the park as its spiritual heart" to the "Threat" category, while the fact that the police action was quickly challenged by lawyers could be an "Opportunity." 
Tell students they may use information from the article they read as a class and other New York Times articles and features about Occupy Wall Street to complete their charts. (Teachers without Internet access might consider printing several articles beforehand for use by student groups during class.) 
You may also want to pull in elements from some of our other recent lesson ideas for teaching about Occupy Wall Street. For example, you might tell groups to look at different opinions on the movement's potential or examine the facts and figures underlying focus on the top 1 percent of the economy as part of the analysis.
When students have completed their charts, bring the class back together so groups can share their analyses with the class. Encourage all students to ask each other clarifying questions and to take notes to refer to for the next part of the activity. Next, have students reconvene in their groups to make predictions about the Occupy Wall Street movement, given the movement's strengths and weaknesses and existing opportunities and threats. Have each small group write down at least five predictions about any aspect of the movement and its future that they investigated. For each, have them provide evidence of some sort, whether in the form of a related article, statistics, a historical parallel, etc.
 When the predictions are complete, reconvene the class and have each group post or otherwise share their work. Provide an opportunity for students to read and comment on each other's ideas, then display the full list of class predictions and a class SWOT chart for future reference. 
Conclude by asking students to reflect on what they have learned. Ask: What propels movements forward? What are the necessary ingredients for making a social movement powerful and effective? What roles might Occupy and other socio-political movements, like the Tea Party, play in the upcoming presidential election? Why?
Going Further | Read the public editor column "Who Is Occupy Wall Street?", about The Times's coverage of the movement. Has The Times begun to address Arthur Brisbane's concerns and recommendations? 
Students follow the news about the Occupy Wall Street movement in the Times and keep personal and class logs whenever events occur connected to their predictions or to the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats identified in class. 
After several weeks or months, return to your SWOT chart and discuss whether the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats are the same. Have some strengths turned into weaknesses, or vice versa? Have some threats become opportunities, or vice versa? Did any of group's predictions come to pass? What new predictions can the class make?

HEADLINE: New Report Cites Strong Start-Up Culture of Dance in the City

BYLINE: FELICIA R. LEE


HIGHLIGHT: The dance world workforce is 35 percent full-time, 40 percent part-time, 14 percent independent contractors and 11 percent volunteer, according to the report 

 BODY:
Dance organizations in New York City are entrepreneurial and innovative, despite having to scramble for money and rely on part-time, contract and volunteer labor, according to a 30-page report by Dance/NYC, the city's dance advocacy group, which will be released this week. The group drew on information about 127 nonprofit dance makers and organizations, culled from the statewide Cultural Data Project, which offers detailed data on finances, programs and employment in arts and culture.
The report highlighted a strong start-up culture of dance. The smallest groups, with budgets of $25,000 to $99,000, had low numbers of full-time and part-time staff and relied on significant in-kind resources but still managed a high level of new creations. Nineteen percent of all premieres and 22 percent of all commissions came from companies with budgets in that range. Companies with budgets of more than $5 million were responsible for 15 percent of all premieres and 31.3 percent of all commissions.
"One of the things that is striking is that you have this extraordinary number of contract employees and volunteers," said Lane Harwell, the director of Dance NYC. "The reliance on part-time workers is a sign of the difficult financial times and it's an expression of optimism. I'd describe these dance makers are entrepreneurs who are at times working for nothing to achieve a different kind of equity - the public and personal expression of their art."
The dance world workforce is 35 percent full-time, 40 percent part-time, 14 percent independent contractors and 11 percent volunteer, according to the report. Despite Mr. Harwell's optimism, organizations with budgets over $5 million were only "growing slightly" and smaller organizations "have struggled on the whole," the report said.
Dance makers with budgets over $5 million relied on ticket sales for their primary source of income, while those with smaller budgets relied on diverse sources of income, including tutoring and contracted services.
New York City provided a majority of government funding in every budget category. Private contributors, though, are most important for smaller organizations (especially those with budgets under $100,000), which derive 62.9 percent of all income from these sources. The corresponding figure for organizations with budgets over $1 million was 36.4 percent. Still, the total annual expenditures of the 127 dance organizations was $230.7 million, which the report called "a healthy contribution to the economy."
The study used a two-tiered sample of information: an analytical base of 103 dance organizations that was available in May, updated with data from 24 additional organizations that became available last month. Dance/NYC is a branch of Dance/USA, a national service organization for professional dance.

HEADLINE: American Migration Reaches Record Low

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: From 2010 to 2011, just 11.6 percent of people moved residences, the lowest rate recorded since the government began keeping track of migration in 1948. 

 BODY:
The share of Americans who move their homes in a year has reached a record low, the Census Bureau reportedtoday.
From spring 2010 to spring 2011, just 11.6 percent of the people moved residences, the lowest rate since the government began keeping track of migration in 1948. The difference between that rate and the 2009 rate of 12.5 percent was not statistically significant, but it was a far cry from its heights in the mid-20th century. From 1951-52, for example, 20.3 percent of Americans moved.
The record low moving rate was primarily driven by a drop in the share of people moving from one home to another within the same county.
Many economists are much more concerned, however, by the low share of Americans who are moving between counties and between states. Declines in this type of migration have been partly blamed for continued high levels of unemployment: stuck in underwater homes they cannot sell, many unemployed workers are unable to move to areas where there are more job opportunities.
Among the people who moved within the same county, 18.6 percent did so for job-related reasons; among those who moved between counties, 35.8 percent followed job opportunities.
Of the 6.7 million people who moved between states, the most common migrations were:

        
California to Texas (68,959 movers)
        
New York to Florida (55,011)
        
Florida to Georgia (49,901)
        
California to Arizona (47,164)
        
New Jersey to Pennsylvania (42,456)
        
New York to New Jersey (41,374)
        
California to Washington (39,468)
        
Texas to California (36,582)
        
Georgia to Florida (35,615)
        
California to Nevada (35,472)
Many Americans have stayed put for their whole lives, regardless of economic ups and downs. As of 2010, 59 percent of Americans lived in the state where they were born. The state with the highest percentage of residents who were born there is Louisiana, at 78.8 percent, followed by Michigan (76.6 percent), Ohio (75.1 percent) and Pennsylvania (74 percent).
Nevada, by contrast, had the most outsiders, with less than a quarter (24.3 percent) of its residents born in the Silver State.
Here's a map, provided by the Census Bureau, showing states by their share of native-born residents:

HEADLINE: Debating Legacy Preferences in Admissions

BYLINE: REBECCA R. RUIZ


HIGHLIGHT: This week, a New York Times opinion forum took up discussion of legacy preferences in college admission. 

 BODY:
Why do top schools still take legacy applicants? The Times's Room for Debate team asked that very question this week, assembling an online forum of six academics, administrators and admissions experts who delivered their own, different answers and arguments.
While Richard D. Kahlenberg, editor of "Affirmative Action for the Rich" decried legacy admissions as wholly discriminatory, Debra J. Thomas and Terry L. Shepard, former college administrators, defended the idea of giving alumni offspring a boost, emphasizing the subjectivity of the college selection process as a whole.
Ms. Thomas and Mr. Shepard argued that applicant categorization and ranking is a necessary part of college admissions, asking, "State universities give preference to in-state children because of their tax-paying parents; shouldn't alumni donors be treated the same?"

John C. Brittain, a law professor, disagreed with them in the name of diversity. "Legacy policies pass on a privilege," he wrote. "And predominantly whites enjoy the benefits."
Tempering the tone of discussion, Stephen Joel Trachtenberg, president emeritus of The George Washington University, emphasized that legacy status by no means guaranteed a student admission. He defended those colleges who might take an extra look at an alumnus's child in deference to their lineage, those people "without whom the contemporary university might not even exist."
Meanwhile, Michelle Hernandez, a consultant and former admissions officer at Dartmouth College, sidestepped the topic somewhat, diverting attention to recruited athletes, who, she asserted, have a significantly greater advantage in admissions than do legacies - and far less deservedly.
"Legacies aren't the group taking up the most space or the ones who fall well below the academic standard," Ms. Hernandez concluded.
Peter Sacks, an economist, delivered a more hard-line verdict, calling legacy admissions a part of the "social reproduction process," in which the well-off commanded preferential treatment.
"Elite institutions have an implicit bargain with their alumni," he wrote. "'You give us money, and we will move your kid to the front of the line.'"

HEADLINE: Doubling Down on Southfork Kitchen

BYLINE: BRUCE BUSCHEL


HIGHLIGHT: No, we have not figured out our first restaurant yet, but we are considering opening a second. 

 BODY:
It's November in the Hamptons. Your restaurant isn't half full half the week. You have become a Saturday night special, a destination for weekenders and anniversary celebrators; the fall-off from the summer is not a surprise, just steeper than expected. You don't know if it's the weather, the uncertain economy, the occupation of Wall Street, or your own particular issues.
You have just changed from prix fixe to a la carte. You have added midweek specials. You discount all bottles of wine on Fridays. You have Sunday lobster specials. You are fishing for answers. You fear you have been so flexible, so eager to please, that you are confusing yourself and your public. You are trying to fix a reputation for being pricey and prissy; still, you will neither serve burgers nor host a happy hour. You will have to settle on an off-season menu and stick to it. You wanted to keep the summer mojo working. You thought your second October, cantilevered on good reviews and word of mouth, would see a spike in business. It has gone where the geese will soon follow, south.
The dead of winter is deadly. There are more snowstorms than hungry visitors. You had always planned on closing for a few months come New Year's Day, as you did last year, but your timetable might have to change. The glow of your fireplace cannot illuminate the solutions to your problems. You have to consider the possibility that your restaurant is a part-time enterprise, a six-month affair. You never wanted it to be so, but reality is sitting at the bar, alone, sipping on absinthe and staring into a space where a television does not sit. You are not mollified by the news that other local restaurants are also going through trying times.v
There are three kinds of restaurants in the Hamptons. Some close up shop right after Labor Day. They don't battle the winter exodus. This works best when you have another restaurant or two, and can shuttle staff to and from the city, or Florida, without having to start from scratch every spring. Some restaurants remain open only on the weekends during the winter with a reduced staff and reduced expectations. They understand the ebb and flow. They are loath to miss the holidays. Other restaurants are daunted by neither rain, nor sleet, nor snow, nor gloom of night and stay open day in and day out, all 365; they swear their reliability pays off in the long run. We are not that kind of place. A skeleton crew cannot run our place efficiently and make ends meet when the turnstiles are not turning in the style to which we have become accustomed.
Choices. We can lower prices and increase advertising. We can explore alternative and additional streams of revenue. We can set up an events department for parties and office shindigs. We should probably do all of the above, but each idea costs money and time, time and money. None will turn a profit. As hard as it might be to say or to swallow, one has to, in the end, spend more time and money in order to not lose as much money and time as one is already losing in a frozen economy.
What is our most likely option? What further investment might actually make fiscal sense? Opening a second restaurant.
 ? 
Sure, on the face of it, it sounds illogical, maybe even hysterical. But in for a penny, in for a pound. (Or perhaps a pounding.) A second restaurant? Look at it this way. At least half the year in Bridgehampton will always be swimming upstream. No matter what we do, the population shrinks and money will be hard-earned if earned at all. When traffic is down, tips are down, and spirits surely follow. We will probably lose some important staffers from an excellent team, and that would be a pity.
So the assets we possess and can transport to a second eatery are a Michelin star chef, a loyal staff, sterling reviews, a growing reputation and a concept with currency. What we don't have is actual currency. We have to raise about $250,000 to safely cover two full years of a smallish restaurant in a New York borough not named Manhattan. We have half the money pledged, from friends and friends of friends, from relatives, from industry people and guests who have expressed interest over the last year.
We are not looking to duplicate Southfork Kitchen. That is particular to the Hamptons, equal parts rustic and elegant. Each space tells you how it would like to be treated. Whatever neighborhood we end up in will have specific needs, quirks and priorities. Price points will be determined by local denizens and the competition. A new restaurant will have a new name and fresh identity. It's connection to Southfork Kitchen will not be a secret, but there is no intention of starting a chain or Southfork West. The elements that will overlap and fuse the two restaurants are the chef and the mindful sourcing: sustainable, artisanal, organic, eco-friendly, small batch, green, hand-hewn. You name it, we aspire to it, hyphenated or not.
Right now, we're lookin' in Brooklyn. The rents are affordable, and our staff is intrigued; Southfork Kitchen will benefit by sharing staff salaries with another entity, while decreasing the possibilities of losing valuable team members. Our business manager, who lives in Brooklyn and knows the borough well, swears it is filthy with foodies, from breakfast to last call, from Sunset Park to Gravesend.
We are fantasizing 45 seats. A reasonable landlord. Lunch and dinner. Wine and beer. The Italian influences of Chef Isidori's family. Grandma to table.
Brooklyn has its own community gardens and breweries, chocolatiers, chicken farmers, green markets, and coffee roasters. Situated half-way between the Hudson Valley and the Hamptons, a restaurant can pull anything it wants out of the ground or right off the turnip truck.
While Park Slope is not Red Hook, and Fort Greene is not Flatbush, the entire borough seems hungrier than the Hamptons, welcoming eclectic and ethnic cuisine, the experimental as well the comforting. It could be just a matter of skewing younger, and multicultural, but Brooklyn seems to enjoy the reimagining of your mother's best dish or your motherland's favorite food. Be sure the hearts of palm are from the heart, not a best-selling cookbook.
So we're lookin' in Brooklyn. We take daily walks through the neighborhoods via Google Earth and have seen a half dozen places. We have an agent and a local guide. If and when we find the right space with the right rent, we will tap our potential investors. We can move quickly. We can cut down on the time and money because we have a team that knows each others' strengths and peccadilloes, and communicates in grunts and glances.
Who knows, some day soon, we may be cookin' in Brooklyn.

HEADLINE: In Innovation Race, China Is Not Yet a Rival, Study Says

BYLINE: STEVE LOHR


HIGHLIGHT: New research by Thomson Reuters tries to draw a more accurate link between corporate patent filings and real innovation. It measures not only the number of patents a company files, but also their quality and influence. A couple of surprises: No Chinese companies made the list of 100 top innovators, and software as an industry did poorly. 

 BODY:
Innovation is a decidedly tricky thing to measure. Patents are the most widely used yardstick, but they are an imperfect gauge of innovation at best.
A report by Thomson Reuters, published on Tuesday, tries to draw a more accurate link between corporate patent filings and real innovation. It does so by measuring not only the number of patents a company files, but also the influence, global reach and success of its patents.
The result is a list of the 100 most innovative companies in the world, not ranked, just in or out. Most of the names on the list are no surprise. Forty percent are from America, including I.B.M., Apple, Microsoft, Boeing, Exxon Mobile and Intel.
One surprise: Not a single Chinese company is on the list. Yet China has become the most prolific patent filer in the world, pursuing a national plan to become an economy based on innovation rather than imitation.
The Chinese plan calls for its corporations and individual investors to file two million patents by 2015, which would dwarf the current filing rate in the United States. David J. Kappos, director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office, has called the Chinese patent targets "mind-blowing numbers."
But patent numbers -- like standardized test scores -- aren't everything. To rank high on the Thomson Reuters innovation-weighted scale, patents must meet other criteria: success (ratio of patents filed to those granted in the last three years), global (filed in the four main patent offices, United States, Europe, Japan and China) and influence (how often patents are cited by others).
China's no-show status in the list, said Bob Stembridge, an intellectual property analyst at Thomson Reuters, seems surprising, but it can be explained. The Chinese patent surge, he said, is "explosive but recent." Chinese filers are "focusing on the domestic market first," he added. So Chinese companies would tend to suffer in the Thomson Reuters scoring because recent patents are less likely to be cited, and patents filed only in China lack global reach.
Software patents, it seems, are another example of a flood of filings not counting for so much, according to Thomson Reuters. The industries with the most companies on the research firm's innovators list were semiconductors and chemicals. Computer software companies as a group came in 10th, just behind transportation equipment.
Critics of software patents would say the low ranking points to the poor quality of many software patents, patenting the obvious rather than genuine inventions. Partly true, no doubt, but Mr. Stembridge also said software patents were far more difficult to obtain in Europe than in America. Software, then, would lag by the research firm's standard of global significance.
The 100 innovative companies selected by Thomson Reuters did well in 2010. They added 400,000 jobs, while sales on average rose 13 percent. It does appear to be more than a coincidence, even though there is a lot more to corporate success than filing high-quality patents.

HEADLINE: Axa Retires Its Gorilla, Who Pushed Retirement Planning

BYLINE: STUART ELLIOTT


HIGHLIGHT: The beast, which first appeared in ads in 2006, is being given a send-off through a consumer sweepstakes. 

 BODY:
 Advertising in the insurance category is filled with colorful characters, among them the Geico gecko, Flo the clerk for Progressive and the menace known only as Mayhem in Allstate campaigns. 
 Now, the menagerie is about to lose a member as AXA Equitable is ending the appearances of a gorilla that has been the star of its ads since May 2006.
 The gorilla (a robot, actually) has symbolized the pitch from AXA Equitable that it is never too soon to think about retirement. The gorilla is intended to represent the voice inside the head of the consumer, reminding him or her that retirement planning is crucial.
 The creature is on its way out as AXA Equitable in the United States works toward having its ads look more like the campaigns for its French parent, AXA, that run around the world. Those ads carry the theme "Redefining standards."
 To mark the departure of the character, AXA Equitable will introduce on Tuesday what it is calling the Destination Retirement Sweepstakes. The idea is that after years of telling human beings that they need to plan for retirement, the gorilla is about to embark on its own golden years.
 "We thought the time is right to retire the gorilla," said Stacy Braun, senior vice president for advertising and marketing at AXA Equitable in New York, as the brand in this country is to be "aligned more closely with the global AXA brand."
 As part of that alignment, AXA Equitable is also changing creative agencies, Ms. Braun said. Instead of using Merkley & Partners in New York, part of the Omnicom Group, AXA Equitable will use the global AXA creative agency Publicis Worldwide, part of the Publicis Groupe.
 With the departure of the gorilla looming, "we decided to have some fun with it," Ms. Braun said, and assume that despite the dislocations of the global economy in the last three years, the beast had "followed his own advice" and saved enough money to retire.
 When consumers enter the sweepstakes, which runs through Dec. 15, they will be asked to vote for a place where the gorilla ought to retire. Prizes include a trip and Kindle Fire tablets. The sweepstakes will be promoted on Facebook and Twitter.
 An unusual aspect of the gorilla campaign is that the creature has always been referred to in the ads as "the 800-pound gorilla in the room," meaning that retirement planning is ignored at one's peril.
 The reference, however, marked the mash-up of two common expressions: the phrase "the elephant in the room," which usually suggests something that cannot be ignored, and the phrase "800-pound gorilla," which is shorthand for powerful people who can do whatever they want. (In some instances, however, people do say, "The 800-pound gorilla in the room" when they mean something that ought not to be overlooked. And perhaps it is easier to get a gorilla inside a room than an elephant.)
 Plans call for a campaign to replace the gorilla ads to be introduced in two stages, Ms. Braun said. First there will be ads in insurance trade publications, expected to begin in mid-2012, she added, to be followed by ads aimed at consumers, likely to start in early 2013.
 Will the gorilla's retirement be permanent? Or, like some human beings who chafe at being on the sidelines, will it return to its work as a pitch beast?
 The intent is "to give him a good send-off," Ms. Braun said, adding, "You never know; we may hear from him another day."

TOP STORIES
A Wave of Partner Retirements at Goldman Sachs | An unusually high number of partner retirements have been announced internally at Goldman Sachs in recent weeks, according to people who were briefed on the matter but not authorized to speak on the record. 
The executives leaving include some well-known names on Wall Street, like Kevin Kennedy and Jeff Resnick. Mr. Kennedy is a member of the firm's executive committee and recently ran its Latin American operations. Mr. Resnick is head of commodity trading. DealBook 
One Secret Buffett Gets to Keep | The Securities and Exchange Commission usually does not let investors keep many secrets. Except if you are a major player like Warren Buffett, Andrew Ross Sorkin writes in his DealBook column.
Mr. Buffett didn't build his company's $10 billion-plus stake in International Business Machines overnight. He started buying the 5.5 percent stake eight months ago, beginning in March. You wouldn't have known that if you had been studiously reading Berkshire Hathaway's filings - known as 13Fs - in which companies must disclose stock holdings. There was no mention of I.B.M. in Berkshire's quarterly filing in April, nor in August. Instead, if you were looking carefully, you might have found an odd footnote that said: "Confidential information has been omitted from the form 13F and filed separately with the commission."
Translation: Mr. Buffett received special permission from the S.E.C. to keep secret his investment in I.B.M. - and possibly keep secret stakes in other companies that he is building positions in that we have yet to learn about. DealBook Column

HEADLINE: Opinion Report: Health Care and the Supreme Court

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: A summary of what's on today's editorial page. 

 BODY:
Every now and then, Verlyn Klinkenborg forgets to turn off the lights in the barn.
Three Republican presidential candidates, Herman Cain, Michele Bachmann and Mitt Romney, have come out in favor of the torture technique known as waterboarding. The fact that torture diminishes the nation's standing doesn't seem to faze them.
In reviewing the health care reform law, the Supreme Court ought to show judicial restraint and uphold its constitutionality.
The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post also devote editorials to the Supreme Court's review of the health care reform law.
In The Post, Charles Lane wonders why the Obama administration was eager to have a quick ruling--before the 2012 election. He suggests that true "judicial restraint," in this case, would involve the Supreme Court determining that they don't have jurisdiction to consider the constitutional issues until the law actually goes into effect.
The Journal, however, is pleased that voters will "have the chance to include the Court's verdict on the law when they go to the polls in 2012." The paper also voices the concern that if the federal government has the authority to order everyone to purchase health insurance, "then there is no limit to what commercial activity the government can command."

HEADLINE: For Obama, a Day Off in Hawaii for Fund-Raising and Golf

BYLINE: JACKIE CALMES


HIGHLIGHT: President Obama made the most of an off day with some golf and fund-raising among friends old and new on a day of idyllic weather in his native state. 

 BODY:
KAPOLEI, Hawaii - Monday was a down day for President Obama between rounds of Pacific Rim summitry, and he made the most of it with some golf and fund-raising among friends old and new on a day of idyllic weather in his native state.
Perhaps it is just as well that he did. Mr. Obama told guests at the fund-raiser that if the budget fights with Congress persisted into the holidays, he might not get to join his wife and daughters for their usual two-week vacation in the islands at Christmas and New Year's.
"We'll see if Washington gets its business done, so I can get here as well," he said.
About 250 people, many in Hawaiian shirts, paid at least $1,000 to attend a fund-raiser and brunch at the oceanside Ko Olina Aulani Disney Resort near Honolulu to benefit Mr. Obama's re-election campaign and the Democratic National Committee.
He told them his visit "has been a little trip down memory lane" -- the president was introduced by Gov. Neil Abercrombie, a Democrat who "actually knew my parents when they first met at the University of Hawaii." The guests included the president's 10th-grade teacher and some of his schoolmates.
Afterward, Mr. Obama played golf at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam. His foursome included two aides and a longtime friend from high school, Robert Titcomb, who drew national attention to his arrest in May for soliciting a prostitute; Mr. Titcomb pleaded no contest.
In his remarks at the fund-raiser, Mr. Obama as usual counted the health care overhaul among the signature achievements of his first three years in office. But he did not allude to the Supreme Court's announcement earlier in the day that it would consider the constitutional challenges to the law.
And he was blunter than usual in referring to his administration's successes against Al Qaeda and its former leader.
"Osama bin Laden will never walk this earth again," Mr. Obama said to applause, adding, "but we've been able to do it while sticking to our values." His statement countered several of the Republican presidential candidates who have said that they would reinstate waterboarding for terrorism suspects, a practice that Mr. Obama stopped, calling it torture.
"Everything we fought for in the last election is now at stake in the next election," he said. "The very core of what this country stands for is on the line."
Mr. Obama, having hosted the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting over the weekend, is scheduled to fly on Tuesday to Australia, where he will announce an agreement for a permanent American military presence there. He then is to travel to Indonesia for another meeting with Asian leaders on economic and security issues.
He is set to return to Washington, and the budget wars, late Saturday.

HEADLINE: Mrs. Obama Reaches Out to Military Women

BYLINE: JACKIE CALMES


HIGHLIGHT: At a job fair for military veterans and spouses, Michelle Obama commiserated with the women in the group. 

 BODY:
KAPOLEI, Hawaii - Michelle Obama, who traveled here with her husband for an economic summit of Pacific nations, attended a job fair for military veterans and spouses on Monday and commiserated with the women in the group.
Among them were the wives of soldiers and sailors who have served multiple deployments abroad. Mrs. Obama told them that although her husband would go on from Hawaii to Australia and Indonesia for more diplomacy, she was "leaving to go back home to Malia and Sasha."
"You know how it is, mothers -- Dad can be gone for I don't know how long, but short time for Mom," she said, to chuckles.
Mrs. Obama's attendance at the job fair, held at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, was part of a nationwide campaign that she and Jill Biden, wife of Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., have undertaken with the Hawaiian and United States Chambers of Commerce to help veterans and military spouses find work. 
She said the chambers have "connected more than 44,000 veterans to more than 2,200 employers in 36 states" and that businesses have committed to hire 125,000 veterans.
"For a lot of folks, making the transition to civilian life is hard, especially in the midst of a tough economy," Mrs. Obama said. But, she added, "You all have mastered state-of-the-art technologies, run some of the world's most complex operations.
"You've overseen hundreds of your colleagues, and you've undertaken missions with no margin for error, working in situations where the bottom line is literally a matter of life and death." 
The event, called the Hiring Our Heroes job fair, was one of several that Mrs. Obama attended while on the sidelines of the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, which the president hosted here in his native state over the weekend for the leaders of 21 nations of the Pacific Rim.
She also got personal on Sunday at a lunch for the spouses of the foreign leaders, speaking of her pleasure at getting "to share this special place with all of you."
Mrs. Obama, who is from Chicago, said she and her husband, who was born in Honolulu and spent most of his childhood there, began spending their Christmas vacations in Hawaii two decades ago.
"And that's really one of the reasons I married Barack" she joked, "when I realized that this is where we'd be spending the holidays. I said, 'Yes -- I love you!' "
Hawaii's ethnic diversity and its reputation for tolerance made it a good choice for a meeting of nations, she said, adding another personal note: "Ever since I first met Barack, he's always talked about how growing up here, in this place, has shaped his character and his perspective -- and it's true. He is a very calm, focused individual, and much of that comes from his upbringing here and the connection to the community here as well." 
The food for the luncheon was grown and prepared by student interns and their mentors at a nonprofit organic farm on Oahu. Mrs. Obama had visited there earlier, speaking with the teachers and students, many of them from disadvantaged families, about the program's mix of teaching about farming, Hawaiian heritage and healthy diets.

HEADLINE: Charlie Rose and Gayle King Join 'The Early Show' on CBS

BYLINE: BRIAN STELTER


HIGHLIGHT: Charlie Rose and Gayle King will lead a top-to-bottom reboot of "The Early Show," CBS News announced Tuesday. 

 BODY:
1:35 p.m. | Updated CBS News on Tuesday announced a top-to-bottom reboot of "The Early Show," its long-suffering morning news broadcast, with Charlie Rose and Gayle King at the helm. The moves will take effect in January.
"What you're going to see in the morning is a program that's very different; that doesn't try to copy what's already out there; and will be a fulfilling experience for our viewers," Jeff Fager, the chairman of CBS News, said at a news conference on Tuesday afternoon.
The new program -- with a title that is yet to be determined -- will have its premiere on Jan. 9 in a new studio that is currently under construction at the CBS Broadcast Center on the West Side of Manhattan.

The New York Times reported last week that CBS was putting the finishing touches on the new format for the program. CBS executives joked at the press conference about the format being a well-kept secret.
In recent weeks, CBS executives have said that because the network has failed to beat NBC's "Today" and ABC's "Good Morning America" by imitating those morning shows, they are comfortable trying something wholly different.
The plan has been the talk of the tight-knit, gossipy New York television news industry for months, but there is widespread skepticism about whether a hard news bent will help bring in viewers in the morning hours.
Mr. Fager said that while the new morning program would emphasize hard news and "real news" - just as "The Early Show" has done for the last few months - "it's not going to be all serious." He said it would cover pop culture as well as political and economic news, describing it as a mixture of what's important "and sometimes what's just plain interesting."
Chris Licht, the former producer of the MSNBC ensemble "Morning Joe," will be the executive producer of the program, said David Rhodes, the president of CBS News. Mr. Licht joined CBS in June as the news division's vice president for programming. He will retain that role while running the morning program, Mr. Rhodes said.
Mr. Rose, who will help to lead the 7 a.m. hour of the new program, will continue to host his PBS and Bloomberg interview program.
Ms. King will lead the 8 a.m. hour. Her move to CBS means the end to her current 10 a.m. talk show on OWN, the cable channel owned by her best friend, Oprah Winfrey.
"We are so happy for Gayle's opportunity of a lifetime," the presidents of OWN, Sheri Salata and Erik Logan, said in a statement. The statement added: "Although her show will not continue on OWN, we look forward to her joining us from time to time as her schedule allows."
Erica Hill, who has been a co-host of "The Early Show" for nearly two years, said at Tuesday's news conference that she was excited by an opportunity to "reshape morning television."
Along with the new co-anchors for the newscast, CBS identified a few regular contributors. John Miller, a law enforcement expert who was hired by CBS earlier this fall, will be a senior correspondent.
Rebecca Jarvis will be a business and economics correspondent. Jeff Glor, Ms. Hill's co-host for the current iteration of "The Early Show," will be a special correspondent.

HEADLINE: Romney Assails Obama for 'Lazy' Remark

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER and MICHAEL BARBARO


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney attacked President Obama for saying the United States had gotten "lazy" in trying to attract new business. 

 BODY:
4:35 p.m. | Updated COLUMBIA, S.C. - Mitt Romney attacked President Obama on Tuesday for making what Mr. Romney described as "disparaging" remarks about Americans, singling out comments over the weekend in which the president said the United States had gotten "lazy" in trying to attract new business.
"Sometimes I just don't think that President Obama understands America," Mr. Romney said, on the factory floor of Colite International, which manufactures corporate signs. "Now I say that because this week, or was it last week, he said that Americans are lazy. I don't think that describes America."
Mr. Obama, speaking at the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Hawaii on Saturday, told a group of chief executives that the United States had grown complacent, especially when it came to recruiting business - although he did not specifically single out citizens as "lazy."
"We've been a little bit lazy over the last couple of decades," Mr. Obama said. "We've kind of taken for granted - 'Well, people would want to come here' - and we aren't out there hungry, selling America and trying to attract new businesses into America."
Mr. Romney's critique sounded a familiar theme in the Republican primary contest - that the president is out of touch with the ordinary American worker.
Mr. Romney, in an attempt to paint the president as out of touch, focused much of his speech here on reciting a litany of things Mr. Obama has said that he disagrees with. 
"Before that, I think it was in October, he was saying that we have lost our inventiveness and our ambition, and before that, he was saying other disparaging things about America, and he was saying that we just weren't working hard enough," Mr. Romney said.
"I don't think he gets what's happening in this country, because the people in America are just as imaginative, just as ambitious and just as hard-working as ever," Mr. Romney said. "In fact, we are the most productive nation in the world. The things we make per person in American exceeds that of any other country in the world. Our problem is not that the private sector isn't productive enough. The problem is the government sector is too heavy and too burdensome, and is keeping the private sector from growing and thriving like it should."
Ben LaBolt, a spokesman for Mr Obama's re-election campaign said the Mr. Romney has taken the "lazy" remark out of context. 
"Only Mitt Romney would criticize the president for encouraging CEOs to promote the United States abroad in order to create American jobs and attract investment at home," Mr. LaBolt said. 
He added: "Maybe that's because when Mitt Romney was a finance executive, he was more focused on outsourcing American jobs and creating profits for investors without any regard for the impact of his decisions on middle class families."
On the campaign trail, Mr. Romney often paints the president as a nice guy who is simply in over his head, but his criticism of Mr. Obama's recent comments have become especially pointed. He reminded the largely business-friendly audience that Mr. Obama had never spent him in the private sector - Mr. Romney spent 25 years in the business world, much of that time running Bain Capital, a Boston private equity firm - before returning to the president's "lazy" comments at the end of his speech.
"I'm convinced that America is not lazy, is not soft, has not lost its ambition or its inventiveness," Mr. Romney said. "I'm convinced that America has all those attributes and more, but that they're being held down today by a government that is too big, that thinks it knows more than it does, and that needs to be replaced by people who fundamentally believe in American principles and the American future."
He concluded: "I will keep America strong, I will keep us prosperous. I can't wait to get into the White House to be able to return America to the people of America."
Mr. Romney's visit here, a return to the state just days after a debate in Spartanburg on Saturday evening, was his sixth appearance in South Carolina this year, and reflects his campaign's changing calculus that he has a real shot at competing here.
The failure of Gov. Rick Perry of Texas to meet early expectations, coupled with Mr. Romney's strong debate performances and a number of socially conservative candidates who could split the Evangelical vote here have created an opening for Mr. Romney. 
Curtis Loftis, the state treasurer and chairman of the Romney campaign in South Carolina, said that since September, Mr. Romney had ramped up his presence in the state, returning roughly every two weeks. Mr. Romney's wife, Ann, who accompanied her husband on Tuesday, has also been a frequent visitor - she has made six trips, including a sleepover with Gov. Nikki Haley, a fellow Republican.
"He knows South Carolina is an important state and he's coming back, and we appreciate that and have a lot of people who will listen to him," Mr. Loftis said. "I think he's going to do well in South Carolina, and he's going to send Barack Obama back to Chicago."
The event's organizers removed five protestors - all military veterans - from Occupy Columbus, a group affiliated with Occupy Wall Street.
The protestors had entered the factory floor by signing in at the company's entrance. As Mr. Romney began speaking, at least one of them revealed a T-shirt with a slogan opposing Mr. Romney's proposal to privatize some veteran's health care through a voucher program.
After the event, Sandra Stroman, a retired teacher who is the executive committeewoman from Chester County, approached Mr. Romney. She had considered several other candidates, but found herself drawn back to Mr. Romney.
"I flirted with Rick Perry, and I flirted with Newt on and off," she said. "I flirted with a few others, but I kept coming back to Mitt."

HEADLINE: UBS Speeds Revamping With New Leadership

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER

 BODY:
LONDON - UBS has chosen Sergio P. Ermotti, who has run the Swiss bank on an interim basis since September, to become its permanent chief executive.
Axel A. Weber, a former chief of the German central bank, will take over as chairman next year, a year earlier than planned, UBS said on Tuesday.
The bank accelerated the leadership change to speed up its new strategy, which UBS is expected to present to investors on Thursday in New York. 
''The bank has a lot of restructuring to do and as interim C.E.O. with a chairman on his way out there's little you can actually do,'' said Florian Esterer, a fund manager at Swisscanto Asset Management. ''This way UBS can slowly start moving forward.''
Mr. Ermotti, a Swiss national, joined UBS as management board member responsible for Europe in April and was widely seen as a potential successor to the former chief executive, Oswald J. Grubel. Mr. Ermotti stepped into that role on an interim basis when Mr. Grubel resigned in September after the bank lost $2.3 billion in a rogue trading scandal at its London investment banking division.
The changes ''will bring essential stability and clarity to UBS,'' Kaspar Villiger, the current chairman, said in a statement. ''It will enable the bank to master the many current economic challenges and regulatory changes facing it.'' He said the decision to make Mr. Ermotti the permanent chief came after UBS ''carried out an intensive evaluation of external and internal candidates.''
Some analysts expressed doubts that UBS could find an outside candidate willing to take on the challenges at the bank, which is facing large job and cost cuts and needs to restore investor confidence after the trading loss.
UBS shares fell 2.9 percent in Zurich trading on Tuesday.
In his first internal note to employees as chief executive, Mr. Ermotti warned that the UBS culture must ensure that events like the trading loss did not happen again. ''I want to make clear that no one's personal interest nor any amount of revenue is worth more than the bank's reputation,'' he wrote in the note.
A former UBS trader, Kweku M. Adoboli, is scheduled to appear in a London court next week to face charges of fraud and false accounting. He has yet to enter a plea.
Mr. Ermotti, 51, joined UBS in April from the Italian bank UniCredit, where he was deputy chief executive. He previously worked at Merrill Lynch, where he was a co-head of global equity markets. He started at the firm's equity derivatives and capital markets divisions in 1987.
UBS said a new strategy, which is expected to include a smaller and less expensive investment banking operation and a greater focus on the more successful wealth management business, had been approved by the board.
The strategy was developed by Mr. Grubel and Carsten Kengeter, the head of the investment banking unit, to help UBS remain profitable despite tougher capital requirements and uncertain financial markets. It is now Mr. Ermotti's responsibility to put the plan into action, and he told employees on Tuesday that he ''will not rest until we succeed.''
''I will execute our strategy, which plays to our many strengths,'' he said in a statement. ''This strategy will be centered on our leading wealth management businesses and our position as the strongest universal bank in Switzerland. A focused, less complex and less capital-intensive investment bank and our asset management business are also key elements for growing our wealth management franchise.''
Mr. Weber's appointment as chairman is subject to his election by shareholders at the annual meeting scheduled for May 3. Mr. Villiger, the current chairman, will not be a candidate for election at the meeting.
''I am proud of what we have achieved during a very difficult time in our bank's history,'' Mr. Villiger said.
Mr. Weber said he would head to Switzerland in February to oversee the handover. He also said he knew Mr. Ermotti personally from his time at the German central bank and that the two men had spoken often over the last few weeks.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: London Protesters Identify With New York Counterparts and Worry of Similar Fate

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS

 BODY:
LONDON -- The news reached London as the first dim glimmers of dawn crested the great dome of St. Paul's Cathedral.
In the sprawling pup tents that constitute the base camp for Occupy London, anti-capitalist protesters who kept vigil through the night learned from their smartphones and laptops that the police had begun dismantling the camp in New York's Zuccotti Park known as Occupy Wall Street. The New York camp was the template for the London protest and scores like it around the world.
Clustering in the tented canteens that serve the bowls of gruel and mugs of coffee that have become the daily menu for many of the London protesters, residents of the 200 tents that curve alongside St. Paul's and onto its iconic forecourt commiserated with their counterparts in New York and other American cities where municipal authorities have uprooted the protest encampments. 
After a meeting on the cathedral's steps of the free-for-all governing body for the London protest, a group of Americans from the encampment took the subway to Grosvenor Square, site of the American Embassy. There, flourishing their passports, the Americans unfurled a banner that read ''They cannot evict an idea.'' They met briefly with embassy officials, who reminded them that the evictions in New York and Oakland were local, not federal, matters.
''What they got was a lecture on the workings of American federalism,'' said Naomi Colvin, a British literary agent who accompanied the Americans. Ms. Colvin is among the hundreds of people who have gathered at the St. Paul's site, many of them unemployed but many others on leave from regular jobs.
On Tuesday, the protesters here marked the passage of a month since, barred by the police from their initial plan to set up in a square front of the London Stock Exchange, they defaulted to their second-choice site, 100 yards away beside St. Paul's.
But any impulse to celebrate the camp's continued existence was muted by an announcement on Tuesday by the City of London, the governing body for the capital's financial district, that it was resuming legal action to evict the protesters.
The tented city at St. Paul's falls within the so-called Square Mile along the north bank of the Thames that constitutes London's equivalent of Wall Street. The cathedral, heavily endowed by the titans of British finance and regarded by them as something of a parish church, lies only a catapult's sling from many of the financial district's most powerful institutions, including the Bank of England.
The governing body's statement gave no hint that it had been encouraged by the events in the United States. But it was imbued with a similar tone of distaste and urgency for a return to business-as-usual that marked pronouncements by opponents of the Occupy Wall Street protest in New York. The London camp, City officials said in their statement, was disrupting local businesses, blocking pedestrians, and causing ''quite a lot of mess.''
Still, the move came as a surprise. After saying in late October that it planned to go to court for an eviction order, it shifted its position, saying it would ''pause'' its plans to allow for negotiations over the camp's future among the protesters, city officials and representatives of St. Paul's.
That led protest leaders to say they were confident of maintaining the encampment at the St. Paul's site into 2012, and to hint that a negotiated solution could lead to the parties settling on a date sometime in late winter or early spring for a voluntary dismantling of the camp.
At least until the new threat of legal action, the London protesters -- a dizzying assembly of libertarians and anarchists, Christian fundamentalists and Marxists, conspiracy theorists and individuals who appear mostly to be drawn by the daily camaraderie of camp life -- had begun to see their presence at St. Paul's as a victory in the struggle against what they describe as the greed and exploitation of global capitalism.
Within days of setting up the camp, they drew adversaries from among many of the most powerful people in Britain, from politicians like Prime Minister David Cameron and the London mayor, Boris Johnson, who supported legal moves for their eviction, to bankers and financiers who saw the camp as a threat to London's appeal as a financial center.
But the protesters found allies to match the establishment forces. A rancorous debate within the Church of England has had hard-liners retreating in the face of a powerful group of liberal theologians led by the archbishop of Canterbury, Most Rev. Rowan Williams, who have argued for an acceptance of the protesters and their cause. The liberals have seen the protest as an opportunity to steer the church toward a renewed embrace of Gospel teachings on social justice.
The City of London said that obtaining a court order for eviction was ''likely to take weeks.'' It also said that ''no enforcement action would take place without further consultation.'' Letters will be delivered to the protesters on Wednesday, it said, asking them to clear the encampment; if these were ignored, it said, the eviction process would resume.
Some protesters saw the threat of legal action as a tactic to prod them into negotiating a voluntary departure. Since the authorities backed away from the threat of imminent legal action two weeks ago, there have been signs that camp leaders have been laying plans for a much longer stay, possibly one that would make the camp a permanent feature of London life.
Sturdier tents have been moved onto the site, and two canteens have been extended. A large Mongolian-style yurt has arrived, with camp residents saying it will help sustain the protest through what meteorologists say could be a severe winter. The chaos of the camp's early days has yielded to lengthy meetings before the cathedral's huge oak doors at which protest leaders sit cross-legged on the stone-flagged floor, poring over hand-lettered organizational charts. Visits to the camp by experts in child care, drug counselors and psychologists have been arranged. Trucks regularly service the site's portable toilets.
''Who knows what will happen to the camp in the longer term?'' said Ronan McNern, who is one of the camp's spokesmen.
''There are going to be many more camps like this across the U.K., and this one is already shaping up as a sort of H.Q. It's becoming more of a political center. In any case, the church authorities aren't pushing us for an end date. So we shall see.''

HEADLINE: F.H.A. Audit Sees Possible Bailout Need

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Chances are nearly 50 percent that the Federal Housing Administration will need a bailout next year if the housing market deteriorates further, the agency's independent auditor said in a report released Tuesday.
The F.H.A., which offers private lenders guarantees against homeowner default, has just $2.6 billion in cash reserves, the report found, down from $4.7 billion last year.
The agency's woes stem from the national foreclosure crisis. In the last three years, the F.H.A. has paid $37 billion in insurance claims against defaulting homeowners, shrinking its cash cushion. 
The auditors determined the agency's level of supplemental cash reserves by projecting losses on its mortgage portfolio and counting them against expected premium revenue. This year, the audit found that the F.H.A. supplemental reserve was less than one-quarter of a percentage point of its current portfolio: $2.6 billion against a $1.1 trillion mortgage portfolio, as of Sept. 30. Legally, the housing agency is required to keep a 2 percent cash buffer, a target it has not met since 2008.
F.H.A. officials argue that the likelihood the 77-year-old agency will need its first taxpayer bailout is slim. ''It would take very significant home price declines to create a situation in which the portfolio would require any additional support,'' said Carol Galante, acting commissioner. ''There is no evidence or widespread prediction that home prices are going to decline to the kind of levels'' requiring a bailout, she said.
The baseline plan included in the report does not foresee the F.H.A.'s going into the red. It presumes that home prices will stabilize in coming months and start to rise in 2012. In that case, the agency's capital ratio will increase to 1 percent in 2012 and 2 percent, the legal minimum, in 2014.
But if housing prices decline, losses from an enormous cohort of loans, most originated between 2006 and 2009, could subsume the agency's reserves. The audit contends that ''significant declines of home prices'' in fiscal year 2012 ''would create a situation in which the current portfolio would require additional support'' from the Treasury Department. In the worst case provided in the report, housing prices would continue to decline through 2014 and the agency would require a total of $43.2 billion from the Treasury. (Congress would not need to approve these funds.)
Ms. Galante said that before the agency got to that point, it would consider several measures, including raising the F.H.A. insurance premiums borrowers pay.
Traditionally, the F.H.A. has helped borrowing by first-time home buyers or those with low to moderate income. When the housing bust hit, the agency greatly expanded its purview, and the value of its loan portfolio more than tripled. In 2006, the F.H.A. backed about 5 percent of mortgages. In 2010, it insured one-third.
The F.H.A. provides lenders with a guarantee if mortgages meet certain underwriting criteria. It finances itself by charging borrowers a premium that offsets the cost of payouts on defaulting loans.
Numerous independent reports in the last three years have predicted the agency's insolvency. Last week, for instance, the American Enterprise Institute, a policy research organization, released a study by Joseph Gyourko, a professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, stating that the agency was underestimating its future losses by ''tens of billions'' and arguing that ''the recapitalization required will be at least $50 billion, and likely much more.''
''If the economy and housing markets deteriorate unexpectedly, we need to be ready to infuse even more capital'' into the reserve account, Mr. Gyourko wrote, estimating that the F.H.A. may ultimately need as much as $100 billion.
Many housing experts have called for additional Congressional oversight of the agency, given the possibility of a bailout. ''Along with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the F.H.A. is the third leg of the government stool supporting the entire housing market,'' said Christopher Papagianis, managing director of Economics21, a research organization. ''What is embarrassing for Congress is that, unlike Fannie and Freddie, the F.H.A. is directly under their purview. It's always been a government agency, subject to hearings and oversight. They clearly haven't been minding the store, given this report.''
Other housing experts caution that the F.H.A.'s insolvency is not a foregone conclusion. ''Whether or not they are adequately capitalized depends on their projections,'' says Ann B. Schnare, an independent housing consultant, who has studied F.H.A. solvency. ''But they have been over-optimistic about their future book for three or four years. Every year, it's like, 'We're losing on this end, but we're going to make it up going forward!' ''
Ms. Schnare added: ''They are doing very high loan-to-value loans in a market that is extremely fragile. People are entering the program without a lot of equity. They're skating on thin ice.''
The F.H.A. report comes as lawmakers are considering raising the maximum loan amount that the agency can guarantee, possibly exposing the agency to more risk. On Oct. 1, the ceiling dropped to $625,500, from $729,750, in some high-cost areas like the New York metropolitan area. However, a bill moving through Congress would return the ceiling to the higher level.

HEADLINE: Loss Puts Head of Kingfisher Airlines on Defensive

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ; Neha Thirani contributed reporting.

 BODY:
MUMBAI, India -- At a raucous news conference on Tuesday that began almost two hours late and lasted almost that long, Vijay Mallya defended Kingfisher Airlines from accusations of mismanagement and instead blamed taxes, oil prices and a competitive industry for the company's financial troubles.
The second-biggest Indian carrier, Kingfisher, which is owned by Mr. Mallya, the Indian liquor and beer baron, was once known for its luxurious service and ambitions to fly around the globe. Now, it is seeking more bank loans after reporting a steep loss for its fiscal second quarter. 
Unlike in the past, when Mr. Mallya commanded the attention of the news media, on Tuesday he struggled to speak over shouted questions and reporters who cut him off.
''It is a very competitive environment, it is a high-tax environment and it's a hostile environment as far as investment is concerned,'' Mr. Mallya said. ''The fact of the matter is that the entire industry is in serious trouble.''
Kingfisher, which is struggling with a $1.5 billion debt load, posted a loss of 4.7 billion rupees, or $93 million, in the three months that ended in September, compared with a 2.4 billion rupee loss in the period a year earlier.
The announcement came Tuesday, after the company abruptly canceled scores of flights on Friday as part of a reorganization of its schedule. On Monday, one of its most important bankers publicly called on Kingfisher's owner to invest more money in the airline, which has never reported an annual profit.
The company's problems are indeed emblematic of the difficulties facing the Indian airline industry, much of which has struggled to make money despite India's rapid economic growth and a 20 percent annual increase in air travel. Many Indian airlines, including Kingfisher, have made expensive acquisitions, grown too fast and cut fares to win market share.
Those missteps have been compounded recently by rising interest rates and a falling rupee, which has made oil imports more expensive. Furthermore, the Indian government has been pumping money into the unprofitable state-owned carrier Air India, which has used the cash to sharply lower fares in an effort to attract more passengers. Only one of the seven largest Indian airlines -- Indigo, which has a business model similar to the Dallas-based Southwest Airlines -- has been consistently profitable in recent years.
But Kingfisher has struggled more than others, analysts said, in part because of its 2008 acquisition of Air Deccan, a low-fare airline that it rebranded Kingfisher Red. The airline decided in September it would end that discount service, executives said, because its regular service, which includes food, is more profitable.
Because of its large debt, Kingfisher spends more than 20 percent of its revenue on interest. By contrast, Jet Airways, the largest airline in India, spent only 6.5 percent of its revenue on interest payments in the most recent quarter, for which it reported a 7.1 billion rupee loss.
''The problem with Kingfisher is their debt has gone beyond what they can manage,'' said Sharan Lillaney, an analyst at Angel Broking. ''Their interest cost is way beyond their operational profits.''
Mr. Mallya, who calls himself the ''king of good times'' and sports a goatee and wavy white hair, said the government should start allowing foreign airlines to invest in Indian carriers. He called on policy makers to reduce sales taxes on fuel, which average about 25 percent, or about five times the rate in other countries. He also said the company was asking its banks to increase its working-capital loans by about 8 billion rupees and reduce its interest costs.
Public officials have said they are considering changing foreign investment regulations, but such reviews in other industries, like retailing and insurance, have been halted for years.
The airline's banks, 13 of which converted some of their loans into a 23.4 percent stake in the company, also seem reluctant to help. On Monday, a senior executive at the State Bank of India, one of the airline's biggest lenders, said Mr. Mallya and his other companies must invest $160 million in Kingfisher.
The airline flies to destinations as far as London and Hong Kong but has had to defer plans to fly elsewhere, including New York and San Francisco.
Over the weekend, the Indian prime minister, Manmohan Singh, said he would consider providing support to the airline. But other public officials, including the aviation minister, have distanced themselves from the idea that the government should help a private airline. India, which has a large budget deficit, has already pumped hundreds of millions of dollars into Air India.
''From the looks of it, Kingfisher is headed in the direction of Air India,'' said Shushmul Maheshwari, chief executive of RNCOS, a research firm. ''There are no quick fixes possible at this stage.''
Mr. Mallya's other companies, including United Breweries, which makes Kingfisher beer, and United Spirits, are profitable and control about 50 percent of the beer and liquor markets in India. Analysts have said Mr. Mallya may have to invest his earnings from those companies in his airline to keep it flying -- a plan that analysts say could hurt those companies.
At the news conference, Mr. Mallya said he would not ''cross-subsidize'' the airline from other businesses. But he added that his holding companies and friends would stand behind the airline.
Shares of Kingfisher closed up 2.3 percent, at 21.85 rupees, on the Bombay Stock Exchange on Tuesday. The stock is down 67 percent for the year.

HEADLINE: Spared in War, Libya's Oil Flow Is Surging Back

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

 BODY:
ZAWIYAH, Libya -- The bullet holes in the oil tanks have been patched, the damaged backup generator is being repaired, and most important, the pipeline that feeds the giant oil refinery here has been reopened.
Oil production is quickly being restored in Zawiyah and around the country, in large part because both the Qaddafi regime and the former rebels, now the interim leaders of Libya, took pains to avoid permanently crippling the country's most important industry during their six-month civil war.
''Qaddafi wanted to keep the refinery going because he needed the fuel, and the rebels wanted the refinery safe because it belongs to the Libyan people,'' said Khaled Rashed, shift coordinator at the Zawiyah refinery's control room.
Libya's oil production remains at about 40 percent of the level that it was before the revolution began. But none of the country's 40 critical oil and gas fields were seriously damaged in the war, according to Libyan officials and international oil experts. Now, most of the important oil ports and refineries, virtually idled by international sanctions and months of fighting, are ramping back up. 
Officials boldly predict that by June, the country will once again be pumping 1.6 million barrels of oil a day, although independent experts say that is conceivable only if the country can avoid a relapse into violence.
The industry's rapid pace of recovery is a beacon of hope at a time when the interim government is struggling to disarm militias, prevent competing tribes from fighting each other, and rebuild shattered cities.
Oil is the mother's milk of Libya's economy -- before the war, it accounted for about one-quarter of the country's economic output, 80 percent of government revenue and 95 percent of export earnings, according to United States government estimates.
''In a country like Libya, oil is everything,'' said Paolo Scaroni, the chief executive of Eni, the Italian oil company that is by far the biggest foreign producer here. ''At the end of the day, the government spends most of its time taking care of oil.''
Unless oil production returns to preconflict levels, the country's economy and political stability will suffer. Conversely, if oil output increases substantially, Libya's 6.6 million people could become quite wealthy -- unlike those in poorer countries whose governments toppled during the Arab Spring. Egypt's economy, for example, has stagnated since the collapse of the Mubarak regime.
Corruption remains a risk. Members of the new Libyan government accuse Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi of stealing billions of dollars in oil revenue. The acting oil minister, Ali Tarhouni, said authorities were investigating more than 20 bank accounts of the National Oil Company for fraud. ''We will follow every penny,'' he said.
With world oil prices near $100 a barrel, restoring Libyan oil production would also ease supply pressures on global markets.
Foreign oil experts caution that even to get production back over a million barrels a day, Libya's interim leaders must end the violence that is deterring foreign oil companies from bringing back expatriate technicians. In a report last week, the International Energy Agency predicted that Libyan oil production would be only 1.2 million barrels a day by the end of 2012.
Last week, at least six people were killed in a firefight between two rival militias that occurred around Zawiyah. In the southwestern desert, where some of the largest oil fields are, there was a standoff recently between one militia and Tuareg tribesmen who raided a Qaddafi arms depot and stole some mortars.
Eni, Total of France and Repsol of Spain have begun to send in a trickle of staff, mostly to restart offshore Mediterranean fields far from any violence. BP, which had planned promising exploration projects, has so far declined to send anyone back.
Over all, only about 20 of the 2,000 foreign oil workers who provided critical technical functions for exploration and production before the war have returned, according to officials at the National Oil Company, which partners with foreign companies.
Jean-Daniel Blasco, Total's vice president for North Africa exploration and production, said a return of his workers ''will depend on the security situation, and there could be political events. This is a question mark.''
Foreign technicians are critical to restart some of the older oil fields that were abruptly shut down. Older wells tend to fill with water or wax when left out of production for long periods, and they will need to be injected with nitrogen and steam -- a tedious operation that requires experienced hands and scarce repair rigs.
However, the war left Libya's oil fields and facilities in far better shape than past and current revolutions in Iran, Iraq and Yemen.
The most serious damage to the fields was when a NATO bomb aimed at Qaddafi forces destroyed a transformer in the eastern Messla field. Repairs are under way and production is back to nearly 70 percent. The As Sidrah oil port facility has been hobbled by a destroyed metering system, but workers are getting around the problem by estimating the amount of oil in tanks and tankers before or after they are filled. Gas compressors at the refinery in Brega were damaged in the fighting, but other refineries are taking up the slack.
There was no damage at the Zawiyah refinery, aside from the destruction of a tugboat full of escaping Qaddafi troops. The rebels, rather than blow up an important pipeline between two giant oil fields and the refinery, soldered two valves closed and then stationed guards there to make sure no one would open them until the war was over.
''Everything can be fixed because there is not much to be fixed,'' said Mr. Rashed of the Zawiyah refinery. ''I think it is a miracle from God that our oil industry was not severely damaged.''
Abulgassen Shengheer, the National Oil Company's general manager for exploration and production, said Libyan employees of Halliburton, Baker Hughes and other foreign companies were able to do the bulk of needed repairs so far.
Workers are making do without air-conditioning in the desert and jury-rigging control rooms as best they can under armed protection from militias. Foreign oil companies are pitching in by helping Libya acquire new trucks, computers and spare parts, and Mr. Shengheer predicted that large numbers of foreign workers would be back by early next year.
''I can't say we can do everything,'' he acknowledged. ''Some expatriates must be here.''
Foreign oil giants, including the American companies Marathon and Hess, certainly want to be in Libya, and the jockeying has already begun for the chance to drill new fields on profitable terms.
Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain, President Nicolas Sarkozy of France and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton all went to Tripoli soon after its liberation to meet with leaders of the interim government, and foreign oil company executives hope that the diplomatic overtures will help them win lucrative contracts in the future.
With proven reserves of 46.4 billion barrels -- the largest in Africa -- Libya is a great prize. But historically the country has been a disappointment for foreign oil companies. During his long rule, Colonel Qaddafi granted foreigners drilling rights on small patches of fields and made them sign agreements that gave the regime most of the profits and left them with most of the bills. Decades of Western sanctions also kept most companies away until 2006.
Now, a new era could be dawning for a country that 50 years ago produced three million barrels a day -- roughly double the output of recent years -- and that might return to such lofty levels with ample investment and new technologies to exploit old and still-to-be-discovered fields deep in the Sahara.
Mr. Tarhouni, the acting oil minister, said the current government's priority was to restart production, and it would leave any renegotiation of existing oil contracts or issuance of new ones for a future elected government. ''I don't anticipate that the interim government will make any major decisions,'' he said.
Mr. Scaroni, the Eni chief executive, is already angling for more business. His company, which produced 280,000 barrels of oil and gas a day in Libya before the war, was by far the biggest foreign producer and counted Libya as an important source of profits in recent years.
Mr. Scaroni visited the rebel leadership in Benghazi last April, flying in via helicopter from an Italian warship, and has been shuttling in and out of Libya.
''The countries that have been involved in helping the new government in throwing out Qaddafi will have a strong relationship with the country,'' he said. ''Libya remains a country where we want to be, to stay, and we want to grow our production.''

HEADLINE: Retail Sales Rose 0.5% in October, Suggesting a Solid Start to the Quarter

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Americans spent more on autos, electronics and building supplies in October, pushing up retail sales for a fifth consecutive month, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. The report suggests the economy maintained solid growth at the start of the fourth quarter. 
Retail sales increased 0.5 percent from the previous month, the agency said. Strong auto sales helped, but even without them, sales rose 0.6 percent, and when excluding autos and sales at gasoline stations, sales rose 0.7 percent.
Overall sales increased even though sales at department stores and specialty clothing stores fell in October.
The retail sales report is the government's first look each month at consumer spending, which accounts for 70 percent of economic activity in the United States.
A rebound in consumer spending was a primary reason that the economy expanded at an annual rate of 2.5 percent in the third quarter, which ended in September, the best quarterly growth in a year.
Stronger economic growth helped calm fears that the economy could slide back into a recession. Still, growth would most likely need to be nearly double the third-quarter rate -- consistently -- to make a significant dent in unemployment.
Another concern is that the growth came from consumers spending more while earning less, a trend that economists fear cannot be sustained.
Without more jobs and higher pay, consumers may be forced to cut back on spending.
The outlook for hiring is mixed. The economy added just 80,000 jobs last month, the fewest in four months. But the government also said employers added more jobs in August and September than it had initially reported, and that the unemployment rate dipped to 9 percent. Employers advertised more jobs in September than at any other point in the last three years, a hopeful sign that hiring will pick up.
Americans are buying more cars. The auto industry had its best October in four years, as sales of S.U.V.'s and trucks offset a loss in momentum for car buying.
Retailers hope consumers will keep spending during the all-important holiday shopping period.
The National Retail Federation, the nation's largest retail group, predicts revenue in November and December will rise 2.8 percent this year compared with last year. That would be smaller than last year's 5.2 percent increase. But it would be higher than the average increase over the last 10 years.
The uptick in retail sales occurred as the Labor Department reported that wholesale prices declined in October for the first time since June, as companies paid less for gas, new cars and other goods. The report indicated that inflation pressures eased as the cost of oil and other commodities declined.
The Labor Department said the Producer Price Index, which measures price changes before they reach the consumer, dropped 0.3 percent in October, after a rise of 0.8 percent in September. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, the core index was unchanged for the first time in 11 months.
Falling energy prices drove the overall decline.
Food prices rose 0.1 percent, after four months of much larger increases.
The Commerce Department, meanwhile, said on Tuesday that business inventories were unchanged in September after 20 consecutive monthly gains, suggesting concern that future sales could slow. Business sales rose 0.6 percent in September, the fourth consecutive gain.

HEADLINE: A Late-Day Rally Loses Steam

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
A day of broad swings in the stock market ended with modest gains Tuesday, as investors balanced an increase in retail sales with Europe's lingering debt crisis. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 17 points. 
The Dow swung between gains and losses for much of the day. It was down about 78 points at noon and was up as much as 86 points during a late afternoon rally that fizzled just before the market closed.
Technology stocks had the biggest gains. Intel rose 2.9 percent a day after Warren E. Buffett revealed that his company, Berkshire Hathaway, had bought a stake in the company. Hewlett-Packard rose 3.4 percent, the most among the 30 stocks in the Dow.
Americans spent more on autos, electronics and building supplies in October, raising retail sales for a fifth straight month. Sales increased 0.5 percent from the previous month, a faster rate than economists expected and the latest indication that the nation's economy is likely to avoid another recession.
The retail sales report helped United States stocks ''show a certain degree of resilience in the wake of the negative headlines out of Europe,'' said Todd Salamone, director of research at Schaeffer's Investment Research.
But Europe's debt woes continued to weigh on markets. Higher interest rates on government debt issued by Italy, Spain and other countries rattled European stock markets Tuesday. The interest rate on Italy's 10-year bond jumped back above 7 percent. When that rate crossed the 7 percent threshold last week, it raised worries about Italy's ability to manage its debts. Greece, Ireland and Portugal had to be rescued by international lenders when their borrowing rates crossed the same level.
The Dow rose 17.18 points, or 0.14 percent, to 12,096.16. The S.& P. 500-stock index gained 6.03 points, or 0.48 percent, to 1,257.81. The Nasdaq composite index added 28.98 points, or 1.09 percent, to 2,686.20.
The prices of assets commonly used as havens from market turmoil, like United States government debt and gold, held steady. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note slipped 1/32, to 99 18/32, and the yield was unchanged from late Monday at 2.05 percent. Gold was at $1,781.70 an ounce.
In corporate news, sales at Staples fell short of analysts' expectations, and the company cut its earnings forecast for the year. Its stock dropped 3.6 percent. The department store chain Saks rose 1.7 percent after reporting stronger sales. Dell fell 1.3 percent in after-hours trading after the company missed Wall Street's revenue forecasts.

HEADLINE: Monetary Fund Urges China to Ease State Controls on Banking

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

 BODY:
SHANGHAI -- The International Monetary Fund warned China on Tuesday that tight government management of the nation's banking and financial system was creating ''a steady build-up in vulnerabilities'' that could eventually damp economic growth.
In the 125-page report on China's financial system, the I.M.F. said that state controls over the economy were partly to blame for soaring property prices, excessive bank lending and mounting local government debt, and that these were among the growing risks that threatened to undermine the country's economic boom. 
The report was the latest effort by the I.M.F. to pressure Beijing to quicken the pace of its economic reforms and adopt a more market-oriented approach to banking and finance in the country, which has the world's second-largest economy.
''The existing configuration of financial policies fosters high savings, structurally high levels of liquidity and a high risk of capital misallocation and asset bubbles, particularly in real estate,'' the report said. ''The cost of these distortions is rising over time, posing increasing macro-financial risks.''
Jonathan Fiechter, one of the authors of the I.M.F. report, said Tuesday by telephone that China had made remarkable progress over the last three decades, but that the country's integration into the global economy made it more urgent for its banks to operate according to market forces.
''Take the training wheels off and let the banking system work,'' Mr. Fiechter said.
While there is no imminent threat of a financial collapse in China, the I.M.F. said state banks could be ''severely impacted'' if the economy were hit by several risks at once, like a sharp drop in property prices and major changes to the country's exchange rate.
In a response to the report, which was completed in 2010 but released Tuesday, China's central bank said that the report was largely constructive, but added that ''several points in the report are not comprehensive or objective enough, and the suggestions regarding the time frame and prioritization of some reform measures lack a thorough understanding of China's reality.''
The Chinese government's control over the economy has become a sore point in China's relations with the United States and the European Union over the last few years.
Only two weeks ago, in a report to Congress, the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission criticized China for pursuing ''state capitalism'' -- policies that give big state-owned companies a competitive advantage over foreign companies doing business in China.
The Chinese Communist Party ''has not expressed an interest in becoming a bastion of free market capitalism,'' the Congressional report said, noting that state companies account for about 50 percent of China's economic output. ''It is pursuing socialism with Chinese characteristics, which mandates a prominent role for state ownership.''
In the I.M.F. report, China's banking and financial system is portrayed as huge, complex and flawed, with state bank lending favoring state companies over private corporations and the financial system creating distortions that affect a wide range of factors, including interest rates, property prices and the exchange rate.
The I.M.F. said, for instance, that despite the nation's spectacular growth, the quality of that growth had become increasingly inefficient. It now takes about $5 worth of investment to create $1 of gross domestic product -- about 40 percent more than it takes in Japan or South Korea, the report said.
Among the lengthy list of prescriptions that the I.M.F. suggested were strengthening regulatory oversight of the financial system, liberalizing interest rates, giving banks more control over lending and risk management and expanding the authority of the nation's central bank.

HEADLINE: Signs of Broad Contagion In Europe as Growth Slows

BYLINE: By GRAHAM BOWLEY, DAVID JOLLY and JACK EWING

 BODY:
The borrowing costs of nations at the heart of Europe jumped sharply on Tuesday, the latest evidence of broader contagion across the Continent as economic growth stalled.
Published data showed that the euro zone economy grew marginally in the third quarter, kept above water by France and Germany, in what analysts interpreted as probably a last gasp before debt problems dragged the Continent into recession.
Traders said the big moves in the bond markets came as investors continued to shed exposure to European debt. 
With few buyers, interest rates on Italian government bonds again rose above 7 percent -- the kind of market pressure that last week led to the ouster of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi.
But they also continued to increase in France, Spain and Belgium. They also moved upward in Finland, Austria and the Netherlands, which have relatively strong underlying financial positions and until recently had mostly been spared the full effects of the financial crisis.
''The concern is spilling over to the other candidates that could be next for the domino effect behind Italy,'' said Millan Mulraine, an interest rate strategist at TD Securities in New York. ''The ubiquitous nature of the increase in yields suggests that the problem is spreading well beyond the troubled peripheral countries.''
In recent weeks, the European Central Bank has been regularly buying government bonds to try to push down interest rates. But Mr. Mulraine said the bank bought a smaller amount than usual on Tuesday.
Without the central bank's usual presence in the markets, bond prices fell and yields rose, and investors appeared to worry that a widening circle of European nations could be dragged into the Continent's problems.
''While France has for weeks been under some market pressure, with fears over the country's AAA-rating to the fore, the likes of the Netherlands and Finland had proved immune,'' analysts at Daiwa wrote in a research note. ''That no longer appears to be the case.''
Yields jumped a quarter of a percentage point in Spain, to nearly 6.35 percent, and about the same in France, to nearly 3.7 percent. They spiked even more in Italy and crossed the 7 percent level, which economists consider unsustainable. The gap between those rates and Germany's 1.8 percent yield also widened to levels that some analysts saw as alarming.
Analysts said they expected the central bank to return to the markets soon, and with a much more aggressive program of bond buying, to put a ceiling on rates.
Compounding euro zone anxieties was a report Tuesday that gross domestic product for the region barely grew 0.2 percent from July through September, compared with the previous three months. That was the same growth rate as in the previous quarter.
In contrast, the United States economy grew by 0.6 percent in the third quarter from the second, while the Japanese economy grew 1.5 percent.
The data from Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, did nothing to alter a consensus among economists that euro area output had already begun to decline since September.
Anxiety about the sovereign debt crisis has led businesses and consumers to cut spending, and government austerity programs have contributed to deep recessions in countries like Greece and Portugal.
Economists define a recession as at least two consecutive quarters of declining output.
The third-quarter figures ''have little bearing on the bigger question -- namely how is the sovereign debt crisis going to be resolved and at what collateral damage to the real economy?'' Jens Sondergaard, senior economist for Europe at Nomura, said in a note to clients.
The huge risk facing Europe is that debt problems and slower growth will create a downward spiral that policy makers may not be able to stop.
If economies slow, then government tax revenue will decline. That, along with higher borrowing costs, would increase fears that countries like Italy may not be able to service their debt. In that cycle, confidence and growth suffer further.
Francois Cabau, an analyst at Barclays Capital, said in a note Tuesday that if business confidence continued to fall during the rest of 2011, the downturn ''could prove to be larger than we currently expect, depressing private domestic demand even further.''
Ample data has pointed to an impending slowdown in the euro area, including reports last week of declines in industrial production and retail sales.
The European Commission, citing painful budget-balancing measures that will weigh on output, cut its growth forecast last week for the 17 euro zone nations, to 0.5 percent in 2012, and predicted that Greece's recession would deepen.
But even that gloomy forecast is starting to seem too optimistic.
Germany, the largest economy in Europe, has been bucking the downward trend so far. Its economy grew by 0.5 percent in the third quarter, compared with 0.3 percent in the second, according to the data released Tuesday.
French growth continued to hold up in the third quarter, but that is not expected to last, either.
Olli Rehn, the European commissioner for economic and monetary affairs, said last Thursday that the European Union's economic recovery had ''now come to a standstill, and there is a risk of a new recession.''

HEADLINE: As the Police Moved In, the Word Went Out: 'It's Happening'

BYLINE: By COLIN MOYNIHAN and COREY KILGANNON

 BODY:
The police began showing up by the hundreds just after midnight. Scores of officers arrived in vehicles that had been staging over by the Brooklyn Bridge but were now at Zuccotti Park. They surrounded the encampment of tents and tarps and booths that the Occupy Wall Street protesters had built and lived in for nearly two months. 
The police ringed the park and set up bright klieg lights, and protesters emerged bewildered out of their tents. Some blew whistles, others urged calm and still others warned each other: ''It's happening.''
The police issued their ultimatum through multiple bullhorns: Get out of Zuccotti or get arrested. Some protesters grabbed valuables and slipped away. But others -- about 100 -- resisted. They contracted into their own tight ring in the center of the park and locked elbows. Some even scrounged for thick bicycle locks and chained themselves together.
Police officers wore helmets, and some used plastic shields. About 1 a.m. they entered the park and made quick work of the tent city and tarp-covered bundles and other belongings. They sliced them apart and tossed them all to the sidewalk bordering this square-block space in Lower Manhattan that had become a communal living space for protesters decrying economic inequity.
The belongings were fed into garbage trucks, and police officers using a pickup truck outfitted with a sound device made announcements and turned up the volume, sending piercing noise into the park.
Hundreds of supporters who had heard about the action and arrived at the park were kept away by the police, as were most of the journalists seeking to cover the long-awaited clearing out of Zuccotti.
The holdouts were hunkered down around a canopied structure that served as the mess area for meals: a brown tarp fluttering over a skeleton of white plastic pipes. The moment was here.
For a while there was a lull: no more orders and little movement.
''This is all we have,'' said one protester, Jason Lee, ''and they are trying to destroy it and take it away from us.''
The protesters' command center (a booth equipped with laptops) was gone, the drums were gone, the protest signs, the pets -- everything but the holdouts.
Police officers had plastic handcuffs. Protesters had gas masks and goggles. There were no more orders now, and the protesters passed cigarettes around, sharing drags. Under the harsh lights, and the sudden hush, the park had an eerie feeling, even while ringed by hundreds of officers and large police vehicles. The police commissioner, Raymond W. Kelly, stood on a ledge and watched it all.
Then the police converged, and the center could not hold. Officers started methodically pulling clenched bodies from the group, one after another, and led the arrested out of park. Most went quietly, walking. Others went limp and were dragged out.A man in a dark suit and a green vest took an American flag from a protester and carefully furled it as the protester was handcuffed. And the arrests continued.

HEADLINE: Investing In Packers, Wallet And Soul

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
GREEN BAY, Wis. -- In any other place, they would be called souvenirs, documents suitable for framing, or even a sham. But here in the heart of Packers country, they are stock certificates that confer to the owner a microscopically thin and perhaps meaningless slice of the hometown team.
The Green Bay Packers are the only publicly owned team in the N.F.L., but the value of the shares they will soon offer to fans is almost strictly of the sentimental variety. They offer none of the privileges, or risks, of normal shares: they do not appreciate, are not traded on an exchange and produce no dividends. Owners get no discounts on tickets, although some merchandise is available only to shareholders.
Perhaps the biggest benefit is that they get to attend the annual shareholders' meeting, where they can vote on new board members and pepper management with questions. 
Yet with the economy flirting with recession and more than 4.75 million shares outstanding, the Packers, who already have 112,264 shareholders, are confident that their fans will line up by the thousands to buy shares again. And chances are they're right.
In the coming weeks, the team expects to complete its offering of new shares. According to a filing with securities regulators in Utah, the Packers plan to issue shares for about $250 each. And fans who have closets full of Brett Favre jerseys and foam cheeseheads, as well as old stock certificates hanging on the wall, may well shell out hundreds of dollars for more shares, if only because they cannot resist the chance to support their team and indoctrinate the next generation.
''We live and breathe the Packers,'' said Chuck Olsen, the owner of Olsen's Piggly Wiggly, which does a big business selling bratwursts to tailgaters on game days. ''Everyone wants to be part of this, so I'll buy a share for my grandson, who is now 1 year old.''
The team hopes to raise at least $22 million after fees, about what was generated in 1997, the last time it sold shares. The money will help offset some of the $143 million needed to add as many as 7,000 seats and replace the scoreboard and sound system at Lambeau Field.
In an era when teams routinely beg, threaten and cajole their host cities into helping them build new stadiums, the Packers' approach of asking their fans to contribute is refreshingly quaint. And something of a tradition.
The team's fans are fiercely proud of the Packers' publicly owned status, which dates to 1923 when Curly Lambeau and four local businessmen incorporated and sold 1,000 shares of the team at $5 each to keep it afloat. The Packers also issued stock not just in 1997, but also in 1950 and 1935 to bolster their sagging finances. Each time, fans snapped up the shares even though they were little more than a gift to the team.
Unlike the growing number of teams that require fans to pay tens of thousands of dollars for personal seat licenses before they can get season tickets, the Packers do not obligate anyone to buy shares. (The Packers do charge ticket holders a one-time user fee to help pay for renovations, but the prices are relatively modest and the fees are refunded if they give up their tickets.)
The ability to tap their fans' seemingly bottomless good will has helped the Packers avoid some of the civic showdowns that have raged in other N.F.L. cities. In neighboring Minnesota, for instance, the Vikings have been negotiating for years with lawmakers, who are split on whether to help the team build a new stadium and how much the public should contribute.
Packers shareholders helped keep the team afloat for many years. But the championships of the 1960s and the N.F.L.'s decision to split its national television contracts evenly among all of its teams helped stabilize the Packers and keep them in Green Bay, the smallest city in the league.
Unlike teams in New York, Chicago and other big cities, the Packers have fewer well-heeled fans and companies that will spend money on naming rights deals, multimillion-dollar sponsorships and corporate suites. In 2000, just three years after the Packers won the Super Bowl, the team was the 23rd most valuable franchise in the N.F.L., according to Forbes magazine.
So the team used all the proceeds from its 1997 share sale and the revenue from a half-penny local sales tax increase in Brown County to pay for the expansion of Lambeau Field in 2003. With more seats, restaurants and a new team Hall of Fame, the Packers' revenue and profits grew.
This year, with a 9-0 record after winning the Super Bowl last season, the Packers are the ninth most valuable franchise in the league, worth $1.089 billion, according to Forbes.
The Packers do not have to ask taxpayers for help this time. In addition to the share sale, the team expects to tap a capital improvement fund dedicated to upgrading the stadium, user fees from the newly added seats and loans from local banks and potentially the N.F.L.
''The Packers have gone to the public in the past when we were in trouble,'' said Jason Wied, vice president and general counsel of the team, who oversees stadium development. ''So to maintain our credibility, we are not going to the taxpayer. Our very survival is not at stake, and we can take on this capital project ourselves.''
This is a big relief to public officials. With consumers struggling to get by, and local governments slashing services, the last thing lawmakers want to do is debate whether to raise taxes to benefit a sports team, even one as beloved as the Packers.
''If it's a priority, people find the money,'' said Jim Schmitt, the mayor of Green Bay, who bought shares for his three daughters in 1997 and was vice chairman of the Lambeau Field Stadium Board when the county raised taxes last time. ''You're not going to see these at Target.''
In a town so devoted to one team, it is not surprising that fans like to brag about going to games, say, during the Vince Lombardi era, or rubbing shoulders with players like Bart Starr. There is also an informal pecking order of fans who own shares from earlier years.
In 1974, Richard Oliver acquired four shares issued in 1950 for $25 each from his wife's aunt. The shares have since split 1,000 to one. But the original certificate hangs handsomely in his home office, where he sniffs at the notion of buying newer shares.
''The only people buying them now are the people that want to be boastful and say to their boys at the tavern, 'I've got a share of the Packers,' '' Oliver said. ''There's a certain amount of pride having the certificate.''
For Oliver, who ran a title business for many years, his shares were a calling card. He loved to attend annual meetings, which years ago were held in a room below a bowling alley across from the courthouse. Oliver recalls meeting players from the 1960s teams and legends like Tony Canadeo.
''It was a good old boys club,'' he said. ''We knew if we ever lost the Packers, it would be the death knell of the city of Green Bay.''
Annual meetings these days draw about 12,000 shareholders and guests at Lambeau Field at the end of July, and many of them tailgate beforehand. ''They're not doing that at I.B.M.,'' Wied said.
Unlike a meeting at I.B.M., the annual Packers meeting elicits few questions about the team's balance sheet. Instead, most concern the team and, this year, the league's newly signed collective bargaining agreement. Some fans suggest ways to improve the stadium. Shareholders vote on a slate of about 15 board members, who are almost always elected with 99 percent of the vote.
All in all, it is a pretty tame affair, which is not unexpected for a team that has 92,000 names on its waiting list for tickets, or fans rabid enough to buy a piece of paper that calls them an owner. Perhaps, though, if fans hang on to their shares long enough, they will be able to resell them for a handsome profit.
Mike Worachek, who runs a collectibles shop not far from Lambeau Field, said a share issued in 1950 could fetch $2,000, while one from 1935 could bring in five times that amount. Their price will only rise when new shares are issued, he said.
Still, fans are so smitten with their shares that few change hands, Worachek said. And even fans who have shares are likely to buy new ones as well.
''There are a lot out there already, but Packers fans are funny,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Beyond Seizing Parks, New Paths to Influence

BYLINE: By CARA BUCKLEY; Reporting was contributed by Michael Cooper from New York; Dan Frosch from Denver; Malia Wollan from Berkeley, Calif.; and Steven Yaccino from Chicago.

 BODY:
The anti-Wall Street protests, which are being driven from their urban encampments across the nation, now face a pivotal challenge: With their outposts gone, will their movement wither?
In New York, where the police temporarily evicted Occupy Wall Street protesters from Zuccotti Park early Tuesday, and in other cities, dozens of organizers maintained that the movement had already reshaped the public debate. They said it no longer needed to rely solely on seizing parks, demonstrating in front of the homes of billionaires or performing other acts of street theater.
They said they were already trying to broaden their influence, for instance by deepening their involvement in community groups and spearheading more of what they described as direct actions, like withdrawing money from banks, and were considering supporting like-minded political candidates.
Still, some acknowledged that the crackdowns by the authorities in New York and other cities might ultimately benefit the movement, which may have become too fixated on retaining the territorial footholds, they said. 
''We poured a tremendous amount of resources into defending a park that was nearly symbolic,'' said Han Shan, an Occupy Wall Street activist in New York. ''I think the movement has shown it transcends geography.''
Even before the police descended on Zuccotti Park overnight, some early proponents of Occupy Wall Street had begun suggesting that it was time to move on.
On Monday, Adbusters, the Canadian anti-corporate magazine that conceived of the movement, indicated that the protesters should ''declare victory'' and head indoors to strategize.
Marina Sitrin, a postdoctoral fellow at the City University of New York who is involved in the movement, said its influence would continue to ripple out. People are already assembling to address local issues in Harlem and Brooklyn, she said. ''There's so much more than Zuccotti Park,'' she said.
Indeed, with winter looming, it seemed possible that Occupy Wall Street's encampment would end on its own as the cold drove people away.
Maurice Isserman, a history professor at Hamilton College in Clinton, N.Y., said New York City officials might have done Occupy Wall Street a favor ''by providing a dramatic ending.''
In New York and around the country, the news media had begun highlighting less savory aspects of the occupations, including drug use, crime and influxes of homeless people who were not motivated by ideology, which could change the message from ''we are the 99 percent'' to ''we are urban pathology,'' Professor Isserman said.
''And suddenly, with a stroke, that's no longer the problem or the issue,'' he said, referring to the evictions.
Still, questions endure about whether, without Zuccotti Park, the movement might lose momentum or drift into irrelevancy.
Doug McAdam, a sociology professor at Stanford, predicted that the energy could quickly dissipate without the occupation. ''The focal point will be lost,'' he said.
The protesters did return to the park later Tuesday, with the city's permission, but without the prohibited tents, tarps and sleeping bags that carried them through so many nights.
''Occupy Wall Street can only grow,'' said Bill Dobbs, a spokesman for the group.
The organizers continue to claim public support. Donations topped half a million dollars weeks ago, and their storehouse, blocks away from the park in Lower Manhattan, is stuffed with nonperishables, blankets and other supplies sent from around the world.
One question is how protesters in other cities will react to the events in New York this week. Some experts wondered whether reduced visibility for Occupy Wall Street might hurt support for the cause elsewhere.
In interviews, protesters on Tuesday dismissed such speculation, saying that the clearing of Zuccotti Park would energize their commitment to seeking more regulation of the financial industry and reducing economic inequality.
''Whenever there is pushback, especially under cover of darkness, I think it will make us stronger,'' said Dan Massoglia, a spokesman for Occupy Chicago.
In Oakland, Calif., Alexandra Hernandez, 22, said recent arrests of Occupy protesters across the country showed that it might be time for a shift in strategy. ''I don't know if the encampments will continue,'' she said.
Officials will be watching closely. The authorities have now cracked down on camps in Denver, Oakland, Portland, Ore., and Salt Lake City.
Portland's mayor, Sam Adams, said the United States Conference of Mayors had organized two conference calls ''to share information about the occupying encampments around the country.'' He said participants on the calls were eager for advice on how cities were handling demonstrations.
William A. Galston, a senior fellow in governance at the Brookings Institution, said Occupy Wall Street and its offshoots were grappling with what many new movements face. ''What do you do for an encore when you've gotten people's attention?'' he said.
While grass-roots movements influenced many major social changes in the United States in the last century, Dr. Galston said that after they garnered attention, they invariably moved on to concrete demands, which the Occupy Wall Street effort has been criticized for lacking. The Tea Party, for example, has sought to repeal President Obama's health care law.
It is apparent, though, that Occupy Wall Street's impact is already being felt.
Union officials said the movement was a factor last week when Ohio residents voted overwhelmingly to repeal a state law limiting the collective bargaining rights of public workers.
''They helped define what it was that was going on, and gave people a sense that you can do something about it,'' said Damon Silvers, the policy director of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.
Less certain is the movement's impact on party politics. The protests took off just as Mr. Obama and Congressional Democrats began trying to push Republicans to agree to a so-called millionaire's tax. Some Democrats cautiously embraced the movement for raising the issue of income inequality, and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee started a petition drive that it called ''100,000 Strong Standing With Occupy Wall Street.''
Last month, after the Congressional Budget Office reported that the top 1 percent of earners more than doubled their share of the nation's income over the last three decades, Mr. Obama used his weekly radio address to discuss the report and income inequality, saying that the middle class was under pressure.
Some Republicans, including presidential candidates, have sought to portray Occupy Wall Street protesters as a band of far-left rabble-rousers.
All of which indicates that the protesters' message has trickled up, despite their tendency to reject the major political parties, analysts said.
Dr. Galston predicted that though protesters across the country were being pushed out of their encampments, their issues would endure.
''The underlying reality to which the movement has called attention is too big, too pervasive, too important to go away,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Economics of Dance For Troupes in New York

BYLINE: By FELICIA R. LEE

 BODY:
Dance organizations in New York City are entrepreneurial and innovative, despite having to scramble for money and rely on part-time, contract and volunteer labor, according to a 30-page report by Dance/NYC, the city's dance advocacy group, which will be released this week. The group drew on information about 127 nonprofit dance makers and organizations, culled from the statewide Cultural Data Project, which offers detailed data on finances, programs and employment in arts and culture. 
The report highlighted a strong start-up culture of dance. The smallest groups, with budgets of $25,000 to $99,000, had low numbers of full-time and part-time staff and relied on significant in-kind resources but still managed a high level of new creations. Nineteen percent of all premieres and 22 percent of all commissions came from companies with budgets in that range. Companies with budgets of more than $5 million were responsible for 15 percent of all premieres and 31.3 percent of all commissions.
''One of the things that is striking is that you have this extraordinary number of contract employees and volunteers,'' said Lane Harwell, the director of Dance NYC. ''The reliance on part-time workers is a sign of the difficult financial times and it's an expression of optimism. I'd describe these dance makers are entrepreneurs who are at times working for nothing to achieve a different kind of equity - the public and personal expression of their art.''
The dance world workforce is 35 percent full-time, 40 percent part-time, 14 percent independent contractors and 11 percent volunteer, according to the report. Despite Mr. Harwell's optimism, organizations with budgets over $5 million were only ''growing slightly'' and smaller organizations ''have struggled on the whole,'' the report said.
Dance makers with budgets over $5 million relied on ticket sales for their primary source of income, while those with smaller budgets relied on diverse sources of income, including tutoring and contracted services.
New York City provided a majority of government funding in every budget category. Private contributors, though, are most important for smaller organizations (especially those with budgets under $100,000), which derive 62.9 percent of all income from these sources. The corresponding figure for organizations with budgets over $1 million was 36.4 percent. Still, the total annual expenditures of the 127 dance organizations was $230.7 million, which the report called ''a healthy contribution to the economy.''
The study used a two-tiered sample of information: an analytical base of 103 dance organizations that was available in May, updated with data from 24 additional organizations that became available last month. Dance/NYC is a branch of Dance/USA, a national service organization for professional dance.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: A Kentucky City Reinvents a Faded Downtown

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER

 BODY:
OWENSBORO, Ky. -- Ron Payne, the energetic and determined 65-year-old mayor of this small city on the Ohio River, keeps a map of new development projects in a corner of his City Hall office. There are more than a dozen sticky notes fixed to the map, each designating the location and cost of a local construction project recently completed, under way or planned.
The total value of the projects is more than $1 billion, including a $385 million hospital under construction east of town; a $2 million, 8,500-square-foot expansion of the regional airport terminal; various road and drainage projects; and a new shopping center along the city's highway bypass. 
But the densest collection of yellow stickers is in Owensboro's rapidly recovering downtown, which after decades of decay is generating significant new entertainment, hotel, housing, retail, and office development.
Like so many other American cities after World War II, Owensboro's pattern of residential and business development spread out from the downtown core. By the late 1970s, when the Town Square Mall opened just beyond the city's beltway, downtown was an island of moldering buildings surrounded by a sea of surface parking lots.
Of late, though, this city of 57,265 and surrounding Daviess County, where 96,656 people live, have invested in an array of business development initiatives in health care, transportation, education, and tourism and travel that focused on making the city and county more competitive in attracting residents and businesses.
Job growth is coming from construction, an expanding medical sector, new businesses in high tech and biotechnology, and the three loan service centers of US Bank Home Mortgage.
Most improbable in this politically conservative region, more than two hours downriver from Louisville, is the $80 million tax increase that provided almost half of the $178.4 million in public and privately financed downtown development projects now under way.
The tax increase, which raised the city insurance premium tax rate to 8 percent from 4 percent, and the county rate to 8.9 percent from 4.9 percent, is paid by residents and business owners on premiums for auto, homeowners, boat and casualty insurance policies. The increase, which came after vigorous debate, was approved by a vote of 7 to 2 in February 2009 by city commissioners and the Daviess County Fiscal Court, the equivalent of a county commission.
Though the new tax revenue is producing jobs and new downtown projects, the effect of the vote on local political careers also was unmistakable. Of the seven city and county officials who voted to approve the tax increase, just two remain in office; two were defeated and three did not seek re-election in 2010.
The largest project by far is a $48 million publicly financed, 169,000-square-foot convention center overlooking the big bend in the Ohio where the city has stood since its founding in 1817. The angular steel and aluminum building, designed by Trahan Architects of Baton Rouge, La., enfolds contiguous zones of glass so the city and river are visible from almost anywhere inside. Construction is scheduled to start in February and be completed by the fall of 2013, Mayor Payne said.
Attached to the convention center by an aerial bridge is a privately financed, $20 million, 130,000-square-foot hotel with 151 rooms. The seven-story hotel, developed by the Malcolm Bryant Corporation of Owensboro, is designed with solar generating capabilities and state-of-the-art energy efficiency measures.
It is the first hotel to be built downtown since 1977 and partly replaces a 591-room hotel that was demolished in 2009. Construction is scheduled to start before the end of the year, and the completion is timed to the 2013 opening of the convention center.
''For so long we were kind of isolated,'' said Mayor Payne, who is credited in Owensboro and Daviess County with leading the redevelopment. ''We were kind of on a cul-de-sac. You had to be going here to get here. If anything was going to happen in this community, we were going to have to do it ourselves. We decided to reinvent this community, and that's what we're doing.''
Along the riverfront and on the busy blocks nearby, construction crews are completing a $40 million federally financed river wall, for flood and erosion control, and shoreline park. In addition, $52 million in city-financed projects are adding promenades, a water-jet fountain, a riverfront playground, and a host of street and sidewalk design features to invite more foot traffic, and the cafes, bars, and leisure businesses that thrive in an active downtown.
Owensboro's downtown redevelopment also is prompting new construction and business starts in other parts of the city. Revenue from Owensboro's occupational tax rose 7.8 percent last year, the highest on record. For seven consecutive years city government has ended the fiscal year with surpluses, most recently with $1.1 million in its general fund at the end of the 2010-11 fiscal year.
The unemployment rate fell to 7.7 percent in September, well below the national rate of about 9 percent. And in the last two years Owensboro and Daviess County added 2,400 jobs, more than any other metropolitan area in Kentucky.
One of the home-grown businesses that is adding new employees and making an investment downtown is First Security Bank, founded in Owensboro in 1997. The bank is spending nearly $3 million to convert a 1960s-era four-story, 28,000-square-foot building on Frederica Street, Owensboro's primary north-south boulevard, into the bank's new headquarters.
In addition the two local developers, Larry Conder and Terry Woodward, said in interviews that they were planning separate projects to build mixed-used retail and residential buildings on empty downtown lots. Mr. Woodward said in an interview that he was prepared to spend $7 million to build a five- or six-story, 50,000-square-foot residential and retail building along Veterans Boulevard. Mr. Conder is planning to start construction in the spring on a five-story, 22,000 square-foot mixed-use building with 12 residences and a 3,800 square-foot food market on the ground floor, at a cost of $3.25 million.
As an example, Mr. Conder pointed to an empty century-old brick building on Second Street that he is interested in buying. Two years ago the owner was asking $125,000 for the 2,400-square-foot building. ''Now they want $350,000,'' Mr. Conder said. ''Prices are going up.''

HEADLINE: Middle-Class Areas Shrink as Income Gap Grows, New Report Finds

BYLINE: By SABRINA TAVERNISE

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The portion of American families living in middle-income neighborhoods has declined significantly since 1970, according to a new study, as rising income inequality left a growing share of families in neighborhoods that are mostly low-income or mostly affluent.
The study, conducted by Stanford University and scheduled for release on Wednesday by the Russell Sage Foundation and Brown University, uses census data to examine family income at the neighborhood level in the country's 117 biggest metropolitan areas. 
The findings show a changed map of prosperity in the United States over the past four decades, with larger patches of affluence and poverty and a shrinking middle.
In 2007, the last year captured by the data, 44 percent of families lived in neighborhoods the study defined as middle-income, down from 65 percent of families in 1970. At the same time, a third of American families lived in areas of either affluence or poverty, up from just 15 percent of families in 1970.
The study comes at a time of growing concern about inequality and an ever-louder partisan debate over whether it matters. It raises, but does not answer, the question of whether increased economic inequality, and the resulting income segregation, impedes social mobility.
Much of the shift is the result of changing income structure in the United States. Part of the country's middle class has slipped to the lower rungs of the income ladder as manufacturing and other middle-class jobs have dwindled, while the wealthy receive a bigger portion of the income pie. Put simply, there are fewer people in the middle.
But the shift is more than just changes in income. The study also found that there is more residential sorting by income, with the rich flocking together in new exurbs and gentrifying pockets where lower- and middle-income families cannot afford to live.
The study -- part of US2010, a research project financed by Russell Sage and Brown University -- identified the pattern in about 90 percent of large and medium-size metropolitan areas for 2000 to 2007. Detroit; Oklahoma City; Toledo, Ohio; and Greensboro, N.C., experienced the biggest rises in income segregation in the decade, while 13 areas, including Atlanta, had declines. Philadelphia and its suburbs registered the sharpest rise since 1970.
Sean F. Reardon, an author of the study and a sociologist at Stanford, argued that the shifts had far-reaching implications for the next generation. Children in mostly poor neighborhoods tend to have less access to high-quality schools, child care and preschool, as well as to support networks or educated and economically stable neighbors who might serve as role models.
The isolation of the prosperous, he said, means less interaction with people from other income groups and a greater risk to their support for policies and investments that benefit the broader public -- like schools, parks and public transportation systems. About 14 percent of families lived in affluent neighborhoods in 2007, up from 7 percent in 1970, the study found.
The study groups neighborhoods into six income categories. Poor neighborhoods have median family incomes that are 67 percent or less of those of a given metropolitan area. Rich neighborhoods have median incomes of 150 percent or more. Middle-income neighborhoods are those in which the median income is between 80 percent and 125 percent.
The map of that change for Philadelphia is a red stripe of wealthy suburbs curving around a poor, blue urban center, broken by a few red dots of gentrification. It is the picture of the economic change that slammed into Philadelphia decades ago as its industrial base declined and left a shrunken middle class and a poorer urban core.
The Germantown neighborhood, once solidly middle class, is now mostly low income. Chelten Avenue, one of its main thoroughfares, is a hard-luck strip of check-cashing stores and takeout restaurants. The stone homes on side streets speak to a more affluent past, one that William Wilson, 95, a longtime resident, remembers fondly.
''It was real nice,'' he said, shuffling along Chelten Avenue on Monday. Theaters thrived on the avenue, he said, as did a fancy department store. Now a Walgreens stands in its place. ''Everything started going down in the dumps,'' he said.
Philadelphia's more recent history is one of gentrifying neighborhoods, like the Northern Liberties area, where affluence has rushed in, in the form of espresso shops, glass-walled apartments and a fancy supermarket, and prosperous new suburbs that have mushroomed in the far north and south of the metro area.
Lawrence Katz, an economist at Harvard, said the evidence for the presumed adverse effects of economic segregation was inconclusive. In a recent study of low-income families randomly assigned the opportunity to move out of concentrated poverty into mixed-income neighborhoods, Professor Katz and his collaborators found large improvements in physical and mental health, but little change in the families' economic and educational fortunes.
But there is evidence that income differences are having an effect, beyond the context of neighborhood. One example, Professor Reardon said, is a growing gap in standardized test scores between rich and poor children, now 40 percent bigger than it was in 1970. That is double the testing gap between black and white children, he said.
And the gap between rich and poor in college completion -- one of the single most important predictors of economic success -- has grown by more than 50 percent since the 1990s, said Martha J. Bailey, an economist at the University of Michigan. More than half of children from high-income families finish college, up from about a third 20 years ago. Fewer than 10 percent of low-income children finish, up from 5 percent.
William Julius Wilson, a sociologist at Harvard who has seen the study, argues that ''rising inequality is beginning to produce a two-tiered society in America in which the more affluent citizens live lives fundamentally different from the middle- and lower-income groups. This divide decreases a sense of community.''

Philadelphia and its Pennsylvania suburbs have seen among the largest change in income segregation. (Sources: Sean F. Reardon, Kendra Bischoff and Anna Ponting, Stanford University) (A23)

HEADLINE: After $5.1 Billion Loss, Postal Service Predicts Weaker 2012

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
The United States Postal Service is forecasting a record $14.1 billion loss for the 2012 fiscal year as a drop in mail volumes accelerates.
''We continue to see steady declines, unfortunately, in first-class mail, which is our most profitable product,'' the postmaster general, Patrick R. Donahoe, said at a board meeting in Washington on Tuesday. ''We have to build tomorrow's postal service based on revenue and volume projections as we look forward. We can't look backward.'' 
The amount of mail delivered by the Postal Service will probably fall about 6 percent in fiscal 2012, exceeding the drop of about 2 percent a year earlier, said its chief financial officer, Joseph Corbett. Revenue is expected to decline to $64 billion in 2012, from $65.7 billion in 2011, he said.
Mail volumes have dropped more than 20 percent in the last five years, hurt by the recession and the increasing use of electronic communications. The service, which is supposed to support itself financially, is closing post offices and processing plants, cutting jobs and promoting the mailing of letters and packages.
The Postal Service, which also said it might run out of cash by next September, posted a 2011 net loss of $5.1 billion in the year ended Sept. 30 after a $5.5 billion benefits payment was delayed into fiscal 2012. The loss in 2010, when the agency made a benefits payment equal to the deferred one, was $8.5 billion.
The loss forecast for 2012 assumes that the agency will not make any of the $5.6 billion in retiree health payments coming due, Mr. Corbett said in a conference call with reporters.
In September, Congress delayed the benefits payment deadline until Friday. If that remains in place, the Postal Service will default on the payment, Mr. Corbett said.
The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee last week approved a bill intended to help the service remain solvent and to lengthen the payment schedule to its retiree health benefits fund.

HEADLINE: Jazz at Lincoln Center To Expand, First in Qatar

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

 BODY:
Jazz at Lincoln Center has plans to expand abroad, creating a new jazz club in Doha, Qatar, and four other cities as part of an unusual partnership with the St. Regis chain of luxury hotels.
The new club opening in Doha, the capital city, next April will be the first time this nonprofit New York City jazz organization, known for presenting high-quality concerts and education programs at its Columbus Circle home, has established a permanent subsidiary abroad.
The 120-seat club is being built as part of a new $1 billion luxury hotel going up in Doha and will be modeled on Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola in Manhattan, with the same curved interior walls, open sightlines, superb acoustics and glass exterior wall with a vista, except that it will overlook the Persian Gulf instead of Central Park. 
With a small population and immense wealth from oil and gas reserves, Qatar has evolved into a cultural hub in the Middle East, as the ruling monarchy has invested money in education and the arts in an effort to diversify its economy. In 2008 the government opened the Museum of Islamic Art, a zigguratlike structure of white stone designed by I. M. Pei, and an orchestra, the Qatar Philharmonic, was formed in Doha. Last year the Mathaf: Arab Museum of Modern Art opened, with 6,000 works. For the past three years the Tribeca Film Festival has run a festival in Doha, which has a small pop music scene, including some jazz.
The Doha club is only the start, said Adrian Ellis, the executive director of Jazz at Lincoln Center. The group has reached an agreement with St. Regis Hotels and Resorts to open four more clubs in new hotels being built around the world over the next five years, though deals on specific sites have yet to be negotiated.
The Doha deal carries little risk for Jazz at Lincoln Center; the group will receive a percentage of ticket sales for booking jazz acts for the new space, as well as a percentage of the food and beverage sales.
For its part, St. Regis Hotels has persuaded a private developer in Qatar, Omar Alfardan, to invest $20 million to build the club, which will be called Jazz at Lincoln Center Doha. The hotel chain, owned by Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide, will employ the staff of the club and pay the fees and travel expenses for the musicians.
Mr. Ellis said the revenue from the Doha club would help support the organization's educational programs, like the annual Essentially Ellington high school band competition and the Middle School Jazz Academy. The group has a $40 million operating budget, of which about $22 million comes from ticket sales, advertising and other earnings. Mr. Ellis estimated that the partnership with St. Regis Hotels would bring in an additional $1.5 million a year in earnings within five years, not counting the contributions Jazz at Lincoln Center might collect from Qatar's well-heeled philanthropists if the program there becomes popular.
''For us it's a contribution back to the bottom line,'' he said. ''We have a vast array of education programs and related programs that don't generate a surplus, so we are always looking for new sources of income to support those. But it's also about reaching new audiences.''
Wynton Marsalis, the virtuoso trumpet player who has long been the artistic director of Jazz at Lincoln Center, said the financial windfall mattered less than the opportunity to spread American culture and to introduce new audiences to jazz.
He said he would initially focus on sending musicians to Doha who are comfortable playing the role of cultural ambassador. The first showcases will have educational themes, he said, highlighting, for instance, important players from New Orleans or different periods in jazz history.
''When we work with our partners, it's not cut-throat, cold-blooded business deals that we are trying to strike,'' he said. ''We are trying to strike mutually beneficial deals that allow us to prosper in a community sense.''
Paul James, the global brand leader for St. Regis Hotels, said the partnership fits well with his company's attempt to use jazz to market its brand, tapping into the history of the original St. Regis Hotel, on East 55th Street, where jazz figures like Count Basie and Duke Ellington played during the height of the swing era.
The luxury chain has been expanding rapidly over the past four years, doubling the number of its hotels to 24. There are eight properties scheduled to open in the next six months, Mr. James said. Turning over the artistic programming at clubs in some hotels to Jazz at Lincoln Center makes good business sense, not only giving the hotel's clubs a classy imprimatur but also ensuring that the musicians are first-rate, he said.
''You can make a jazz club, but you can't make a Jazz at Lincoln Center jazz club,'' Mr. James said. ''That sense of quality and professionalism and the talent of that musician pool is untouchable.''
Mr. James said he approached Jazz at Lincoln Center about the possibility of a partnership in October 2010. The timing was fortunate, Mr. Ellis said. He and Mr. Marsalis had been talking to some of the organization's board members about establishing a more permanent presence in other cities, replicating the acoustic experience audiences have had since Jazz at Lincoln Center moved into the Time Warner Center in 2004 and raised $131 million to build three high-tech performance spaces.
''St. Regis pitched us our idea,'' Mr. Ellis said.
Mr. James said the pieces of the deal came together quickly because Mr. Alfardan, the real estate developer who owns the new hotel in Doha, is a jazz fan and eagerly embraced the proposal.
It is unclear where the future Jazz at Lincoln Center clubs will be built, Mr. James said. St. Regis has entered into talks with the owners and developers of several hotels in other American cities, China and Latin America.
Mr. Ellis said he was confident that at least four more clubs could be opened over the next five years, given the number of hotel projects in the St. Regis pipeline. If it is successful, the performance space in Doha could become a model for other partnerships with for-profit companies.
''If we are careful not to bite off more than we can chew, it could transform our business model,'' Mr. Ellis said.

 BODY:
BOSTON -- Hours after New York Police officers raidedOccupy Wall Street, the protest that spurred a nationwide movement of demonstrators camping in front of government buildings and financial institutions, protestors around the country said Tuesday that they hoped the breakup of the New York encampment would energize the movement but that it would otherwise have little impact on their own protests.
At several encampments, demonstrators who had watched the nighttime police raid in New York via live video streamed on the Internet and over Twitter and Facebook, said that while the Wall Street protest at Zuccotti Park had been their model and given them inspiration, they had no intention of halting their own demonstrations in response.
''I obviously think this is pretty devastating,'' said Becca Chavez, 29, who has participated in Occupy Denver, which itself has had a series of run-ins with the police in recent weeks, leading to dozens of arrests. ''It was hard to watch. I think because New York was a symbol for so much, if anything, this will get people involved. What they had set up in Zuccotti Park was a community. They really know what they were doing. I think this will really pull a lot of people in who would have not otherwise thought of getting involved.'' 
At Occupy Oakland, which has been raided twice by the police -- once with officers using tear gas and projectiles against demonstrators -- one protester, Alexandra Hernandez, 22, said Tuesday that while Occupy Wall Street had served as a beacon for other protests, its existence was no longer necessary for the other demonstrations to continue.
''At the beginning, Zuccotti Park was essential for the movement,'' she said. ''When I saw the park for the first time, it made me think this was possible. It was physical evidence of a movement. To have a physical location was really important. It was different than anything that I'd seen in my lifetime.''
But she said that in light of the recent mass arrests of Occupy protesters across the country, it might be time for a shift in strategy. ''The physical encampments have been an important symbol of this movement -- it's a taking back of public space,'' she said. ''There are a lot of people that still want to struggle to have encampments again. I don't know if the encampments will continue.'' Occupy demonstrations are intentionally leaderless, and protesters in different cities act independently of one another with each group making decisions about what to protest -- though most of the camps appeared to have coalesced around opposition to growing disparities in individual wealth, the perceived greed of corporations and financial institutions, and high unemployment levels.
While many cities originally welcomed the protests after encampments began popping up about two months ago, the autonomy of the different sites has flummoxed law enforcement officers, many of whom have struggled with how to deal with them.
More recently, cities began enforcing prohibitions on camping and bans on tents.
And during the last several days, prior to the New York raid, authorities in Salt Lake City and Portland, Ore., as well as in Oakland and Denver, cracked down on the camps, making hundreds of arrests and flattening tents. Local officials said the camps had become public nuisances with sanitation, drug and other crime problems.
In at least two encampments around the country, people were discovered to have died inside their tents, and in Oakland, a fatal shooting near the encampment involving people who stayed there was among the reasons Mayor Jean Quan gave for ordering a second raid on the camp.
Mayor Quan said Tuesday in a radio interview that she was one of 18 officials on a conference call last Thursday organized by the United States Conference of Mayors to discuss local responses to Occupy encampments around the country. Mayor Sam Adams of Portland, Ore., said there had been two calls hosted by the organization ''to share information about the occupying encampments around the country.'' He described the calls as check-ins to share information and advice on how various cities were handling the demonstrations.
''We did not talk about what any mayor was considering in terms of any action or inaction,'' Mr. Adams said.
A day after the Occupy Oakland camp was cleared out by the police, protesters there on Tuesday planned to march to join Occupy Cal demonstrators at the University of California at Berkeley. Protesters have said that they intend to repitch their tents on campus after an attempt to do so last week was thwarted by the police.
''The camps and the sites in other cities have become autonomous enough that it is not the kind of network where if one goes down, they all go down,'' said Ms. Hernandez, an Oakland protester.
Officials at the University of California, Berkeley, said a man was shot by campus police on Tuesday when he pulled out a gun in a computer lab at the business school. A spokesman for the campus police said there was no reason to suspect the gunman was connected to the Occupy protests.
The raids, and cold, wet weather in some places, have significantly reduced the number of protesters in some cities.
On Tuesday in Denver for instance, there were only about a dozen people at a park across from the state capitol building, down substantially from the past six weeks, during which the police made approximately 84 arrests of people who had established an encampment there. In Boston, protesters Tuesday placed a large banner at the entrance to their camp in Dewey Square that read, ''At 2 a.m. on Nov. 15 without warning NYPD raided OWS.''
''Last night the air was just electric with anxiety,'' said John Ford, who runs the library at the encampment of about 150 tents, which is across the street from the Federal Reserve Bank. ''A lot of people were convinced it was happening here.''
Demonstrators at Occupy Boston, one of the larger encampments in the country, with about 140 tents on Tuesday, said they had been warily watching the raids elsewhere. ''I went home and got a helmet, just in case, after I heard about what happened in Oakland,'' Mr. Ford said. He said he also had a plan to pack up the library, which now holds more than 1,000 books. ''If they gave us three hours' notice, I could get out of here,'' he said. On Tuesday, the National Lawyers Guild, the American Civil Liberties Union and lawyers representing the Occupy Boston movement asked a Superior Court judge for an injunction barring the City of Boston and the police from removing protestors from the encampment.
In Chicago, there were only about half a dozen protesters standing amid office workers early Tuesday on a sidewalk across LaSalle Street from the Federal Reserve Bank in downtown Chicago.
Dan Massoglia, a member of the group's press committee, said he hoped the raid in New York would re-energize the movement.
''Whenever there is pushback, especially under cover of darkness, I think it will make us stronger,'' Mr. Massoglia said.
Latron Price, 37, an organizer of Occupy Atlanta, said Tuesday he believed the raid on Occupy Wall Street was a sign that the protests had struck a nerve.
''To see that happen in New York shows we're on the right track,'' he said. ''These arrests will only strengthen the protests elsewhere.''
While the number of protesters around the country have fallen, they appear to have grown in Los Angeles, where people are camped on the lawn of City Hall. Some have built plywood structures decorated with anti-Federal Reserve murals. On news of the New York raid, about 100 held a march accompanied by the police, said Sergeant Mitzi Fierro of the Los Angeles police.
Sergeant Fierro said, however, that while the protesters would be allowed to stay for the time being, some kind of change would need to happen soon.
''At some point, we're going to have to address that they're camped out on the City Hall lawn,'' she said. ''They've destroyed the lawn. They're becoming detrimental to the trees, and it's also become a health issue. At some point, hopefully very shortly, there has to be some kind of cleanup or movement to address those issues.''

HEADLINE: Village in Iraq Falters With Exit of U.S. Troops

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER

 BODY:
SOKUR, Iraq -- The name of this dusty little village means falcon in Arabic, a reference to its history as a residential community for workers at a nearby airport. But most people in Iraq call it Traitor Town.
''It's not fair, but it's true,'' one market vendor here said about the nickname, pointing down the street to the walls of a now-empty American base just beyond.
Years ago, the residents of this town formed an alliance with the Americans who had moved into the airport and renamed it Speicher Base.
Nearly every young man in the town worked at the base, making this place an illustrative, if extreme, example of the unfortunate turn of fate for Iraqis who took jobs with the United States military during the nearly nine-year war, and who are now being left behind. 
A United States visa program for them is stalled in red tape, while the Iraqi government has no formal program to help. Though these workers were laid off months ago, they are now, finally and irrevocably, deprived of their job opportunities, off the bases and being shunned, or worse.
''At least they could come by to say goodbye, and say thank you, or maybe sorry to leave you in this disturbing situation,'' the mayor, Adel Turki, said of the Americans in an interview. ''But nobody said goodbye.''
Nobody denies, either, that the village had a heyday with the American base next door. Workers bought cars, built homes and started families.
But back in February, ''the American guys say 'no more work in Speicher,' '' Mustafa Nasser, a laborer, said in English, which is widely if imperfectly spoken in this town. Mr. Nasser made a gesture of washing his hands, and then of waving them in the air, as if showing helicopters disappearing into the sky.
For the military's local allies in Iraq, this treatment is a contrast with, for example, the program four decades ago to move the Hmong tribes of Vietnam, who had allied with the United States, to America in a lengthy and costly resettlement effort. As with the venture in Iraq more broadly, military officers, and many Americans back home, seem ready to admit they have already done all they can.
''The opportunity to help Iraq with Iraq's problems is not to move everybody who worked for us to the United States,'' Gen. Jeffrey Buchanan, the military's top spokesman in Iraq, said in an interview. ''We gave them a means of employment for as long as we could.''
The Iraqi government of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki is also a product of the United States occupation, of course, but has swiveled to adopt positions critical of the United States after elections in 2010, generally considered free and fair. The elections forced a coalition with the anti-American cleric Moktada al-Sadr, whose militia fought the United States for years, and who surely holds no sympathy for former base workers today.
Iraqi employees received from the United States military plaques of appreciation and letters of recommendation, carefully saved now in clear plastic folders.
But unfortunately for residents of Sokur, the closest jobs are in nearby Tikrit, Saddam Hussein's hometown, which is packed with people who hate them.
Amir Abu Ali sidled into the town cafe around noon on a recent day, rubbing the sleep from his eyes. He is unemployed after working his entire adult life at Speicher Base, starting in 2003 as a 16-year-old, parlaying odd jobs for contractors into work as an interpreter, once he learned English.
Mr. Abu Ali has a note, signed by an American lieutenant, that says, ''This letter of recommendation is testament to his personal character and selfless services to our men and women serving in the United States Armed Forces.'' The note adds that he ''provided information freely to my soldiers about current situations.''
Mr. Abu Ali said of the letter, ''When I want to die I'll show this to a business'' in Iraq while applying for a job.
The United States military once took the town under its wing. A symbiosis developed. About 500 of the town's 2,000 residents worked at the base. Residents do not deny they helped the Americans by, as Mr. Abu Ali put it, ''telling them who is the good guy and who is the bad guy.''
When, inevitably, the insurgents retaliated with threats and attacks, the United States military built a wall of dirt bags around Sokur; when it became too dangerous to shop in Tikrit, Humvees rolled through the streets, dropping off groceries; an Army doctor checked up on the children.
Helicopters, flying to and from the base, swooped over so the pilots could throw candy out the window on the town they knew supported the Americans, to the smiling, waving children below.
''The Americans protected the town, and we protected the Americans,'' said one police officer, still working in the station built with help from the United States.
Young men from elsewhere in Iraq moved here to take jobs at Speicher Base, turning it into a little eddy in the swirl of ethnic and sectarian violence in this country, a refuge for those who had one thing in common: a willingness to take the side of the United States.
Ibrahim Kalo, who sells sodas from a refrigerator he bought secondhand at the base, said, ''I knew it was dangerous to work for the Americans, but I wasn't worried because we had the base here.''
But the base closed Oct. 20, in a ceremony to which residents of Sokur were not invited.
At the peak of the United States deployment, 505 American bases operated in Iraq, meaning the problems of this town are far from unique. For Iraqis living in a country in the midst of a war that by United States military acknowledgment is still going on, with about a dozen insurgent groups active, even former employment with the Americans is a death sentence, if word slips out.
Sticky bombs slapped onto cars severely wounded two suspected informants for the United States military in Diyala Province last month, for example.
''People hate us because we were traitors,'' said Haidar Mahsan, who sold DVDs on the base for seven years. ''Traitor Town. That is what they call us.''
Mr. Turki, the mayor, said he could not even count the number of death threats he had received. Through an intermediary, he said, insurgents once conveyed the following, unambiguous message: ''We will kill you, we will kill your sons, we will kill your family, we will burn down your house.''
In the embrace of the United States Army, he did not worry. Officers often stopped by his home for tea, and to hear his views on local conditions. ''Now, all we can do is protect ourselves,'' he said, nervously pulling back the lapel of his polyester jacket to reveal a pistol, scant help compared with the United States Army.
''We were expecting that maybe, before they withdrew, they would come and talk to us, discuss if we needed anything,'' he said. ''But that didn't happen.''
In the last months the base operated, Mr. Turki took to standing in his front yard to watch the convoys roll past. He became convinced, he said, that the officers were ashamed to come by.
''They were avoiding us,'' he said. ''They would drive by, but not stop. They did not want to talk about these matters.''

HEADLINE: Republicans Express Optimism on Deficit Proposal as Democrats Sound Glum

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER and ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Congressional leaders began to insert themselves more deeply Tuesday into the work of a joint committee charged with taming the deficit, as Republicans in both chambers embraced a plan devised by Senator Patrick J. Toomey, one of their party's representatives on the panel. Democrats appeared to be less united and struggling to come up with a counteroffer.
House Republicans, back from a week of recess, met to discuss the Republican offer, which includes $300 billion in new tax revenue over 10 years and a rewriting of the tax code. The package was warmly received by many House Republicans at a meeting of their caucus on Tuesday, according to people who attended. 
''All of us have a lot of respect for Pat Toomey,'' said Representative Jeff Flake of Arizona, one of the most conservative House members. ''He's a good free-market conservative.''
Democrats said they were dismayed to see Republicans rallying around the proposal without offering further concessions to address Democrats' concerns.
''Republicans took a step backward today by coalescing around the Toomey plan, which Democrats have roundly rejected,'' a Democrat close to the negotiations said Tuesday night. ''That's a troubling, worrisome sign. The door is still open; discussions will continue. But if this becomes the Republicans' last, best, final offer, they could be dooming these negotiations.''
Representative Jeb Hensarling of Texas, the ranking Republican on the committee, said Republicans were not going to accept Democrats' demands for much more revenue. ''We have gone as far as we feel we can go,'' Mr. Hensarling said on the CNBC program ''The Kudlow Report.''
Democrats dismissed the Republican offer last week as inadequate, saying it did not raise enough revenue and would provide a windfall to millionaires by permanently reducing the top tax rate. But Republicans said Democrats had yet to counter the Republican proposal.
One Democrat on the panel, Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, said Sunday on Fox News that his party had not ''coalesced around a plan,'' even though the Democratic members made their first offer nearly three weeks ago, one that Republicans rejected out of hand.
But it is far from clear that unanimity exists in the Republicans' legislative world, either. Representative Eric Cantor, the majority leader, has repeatedly refused this week to endorse the Republican plan, saying that he is not acquainted with its details, even though his staff has been in several meetings and the plan was carefully presented by Mr. Hensarling, the co-chairman of the joint panel, on Tuesday at the meeting of House Republicans.
While the Capitol was abuzz with reports of new offers and serious negotiations, the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, threw cold water on hints of progress toward a deal.
''So far,'' Mr. Reid said, ''I have not seen an indication that the Republicans are willing to agree to a balanced approach'' that includes substantial new revenue and savings in entitlement programs.
Mr. Reid met Tuesday with Speaker John A. Boehner, who met later with panel Republicans and the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.
The 12-member panel, the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, has until Nov. 23 to vote on legislation to reduce future deficits by a total of $1.2 trillion over 10 years. If it falls short or if Congress does not approve its recommendations before the end of this year, automatic cuts would take effect, starting in 2013.
Republicans and some Democrats saw a possible breakthrough last week when Republicans on the committee, long hostile to new taxes, offered the proposal to raise $300 billion in new tax revenue, mainly by scaling back tax deductions for higher-income households. Mr. Reid on Tuesday appeared to minimize the significance of the offer, saying, ''I don't know what the Republican proposal is.''
Mr. McConnell said that ''failure is not an option'' for the committee, but he sounded almost as frustrated as Mr. Reid.
''The proposal laid on the table by Republicans on the joint select committee has not been countered for over a week,'' he said. ''We're still waiting for what the Democrats might be willing to do. It's been a long week, waiting for a counterproposal.''
Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, a Democratic member of the panel, said, ''That's interesting,'' in response to Republican complaints.
''We are having continuing discussions with them,'' Mr. Van Hollen said.
Democrats balked Tuesday at a possible bipartisan agreement that would save tens of billions of dollars by reducing the annual cost-of-living adjustment in Social Security benefits. Senator Barbara A. Mikulski, Democrat of Maryland, denounced the idea, which has found support among some panel members of both parties. Under the proposal, the government would use a different measure of inflation to calculate the cost-of-living adjustment.
''This is not just a technical correction,'' Ms. Mikulski said. ''It could very well have a chain reaction, pushing old people into poverty.''
The proposal is based on the assumption that when the price of goods increases, consumers buy cheaper alternatives. But for older Americans, she said, health care is one of their main expenses, and they cannot easily find cheaper alternatives.
''This is not like giving up opera tickets for movie tickets,'' Ms. Mikulski said. ''It's not like giving up a latte for Dunkin' Donuts.''
But even as Democrats sounded glum, Republicans began showing a bit more optimism, based on their own party's plan.
''It seems we had a breakthrough where the Republican negotiators did put new revenue on the table,'' Senator Susan Collins of Maine said. ''I think they deserve great credit for that, and it's my understanding that some but not all of the Democrats have put forth entitlement reforms, so that is certainly progress.''

HEADLINE: As U.S. Looks Toward Asia, It Sees China Everywhere

BYLINE: By IAN JOHNSON and JACKIE CALMES; Mark Landler contributed reporting from Washington, and Michael Wines from Beijing. Li Bibo contributed research from Beijing.

 BODY:
The last time the remote Australian city of Darwin played a significant role in American military planning was during the early days of World War II, when Gen. Douglas MacArthur used the port as the base for his campaign to reclaim the Pacific from the Japanese.
So it was with considerable symbolism that President Obama arrived on Wednesday in Canberra, Australia's capital, for a trip that will include an announcement that the United States plans to use Darwin as a new center of operations in Asia as it seeks to reassert itself in the region and grapple with China's rise.
The United States is taking some first steps -- bold in rhetoric, still mostly modest in practice -- to prove to its Asian allies that it intends to remain a crucial military and economic power in the region as the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan draw to a close. The new Australian base, coming after decades in which the Pentagon has been slowly but steadily reducing its troop presence in Asia, puts American planes and ships closer to trading corridors in the South China Sea, where some traditional American allies worry that China is trying to flex its military muscle. 
Over the past year and a half, China has moved to assert territorial claims in the resource-rich but hotly contested waters near the Philippines and Vietnam. Many of the region's smaller countries have asked Washington to re-engage in the region as a counterweight.
''The U.S. needs to show the Chinese that they still have the power to overwhelm them, that they still can prevail if something really wrong happens,'' said Huang Jing, a foreign affairs analyst and visiting professor at the National University of Singapore. ''It's a hedging policy.''
For the United States, the more muscular approach toward China has far-reaching implications, not just geopolitically but also economically. With Republicans at home calling for punitive measures against China for its currency and trade practices, Mr. Obama wants to appear strong in pressing Beijing. He made headway on an ambitious American plan to create a Pacific free trade zone, known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, that, for now, would not include China.
For the Pentagon, which faces sweeping budget cuts in Congress, shifting its focus toward Asia provides a strong argument against cutting back its naval presence in the Pacific -- something that Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta explicitly ruled out in a recent visit to the region. He and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton have been prime proponents of the emphasis on Asia, with Mrs. Clinton shoring up old alliances, like those with Japan and South Korea, and cultivating new partners, like India and Indonesia.
Inside the White House, that emphasis has been reinforced by the president's national security adviser, Thomas E. Donilon, who has argued that the United States needs to ''rebalance'' its strategic emphasis, from the combat theaters in Iraq and Afghanistan toward Asia, where he contends that Washington has put too few resources in recent years, because of its preoccupation with the two wars.
China has become the largest trading partner with most of the countries in the region, undercutting American economic influence. It also is projecting military power more broadly than at any other time in modern history. Its true military budget is not made public, but experts say it has at least tripled over the past decade, allowing China to strengthen a relatively weak maritime presence by building more modern ships that can operate with greater range and arming its first aircraft carrier. It has shown off what appears to be new stealth aircraft and has bought advanced weapons from Russia.
United States military spending remains many times larger than analysts' projections of China's real military budget, but much of that has been sucked into the Afghan and Iraq conflicts. Further, the Obama administration has committed to cutting $400 billion over 10 years, and budget battles may result in further cuts.
The American situation widens the opening for a more assertive China.
Earlier last year, Chinese officials warned administration officials visiting Beijing that China would not tolerate any interference in the region. This year, Chinese ships or planes began taking more forceful action. Officials in the Philippines say Chinese forces entered Philippine waters or airspace six times, including once when a Chinese frigate fired in the direction of a Philippine fishing boat. Vietnam has reported that Chinese ships cut the cables of two exploration ships carrying out seismic surveys.
On Tuesday, Philippine officials said China had recently protested their plans to explore waters less than 50 miles offshore from the Philippines, saying the waters fall under its territorial jurisdiction.
The United States began pushing back last year. A quadrennial Pentagon review identified several countries in the region as strategic partners. The United States also began to restore bilateral ties with Myanmar (formerly Burma) and to promote ties with Indonesia.
Most dramatically, at a regional meeting in Hanoi in the summer of 2010, Mrs. Clinton emphatically argued that the United States had a vital interest in maintaining open and peaceful sea lanes in the South China Sea. She called for all disputes to be settled in international forums. China's foreign minister stormed out.
Administration officials have hewed to Mrs. Clinton's line. ''The South China Sea is a very important maritime common for the entire region'' but also for the United States, Adm. Robert F. Willard, commander of the United States Pacific Command, told reporters traveling with Mr. Obama. The navigation lanes account for $5.3 trillion in bilateral annual trade, of which $1.2 trillion is American, he said.
Obama administration officials say its stronger role is not just because of American interests. Benjamin Rhodes, deputy national security adviser for strategic communications, said Mr. Obama was focusing on ''responding to both the extraordinary interest we have in the region, but also a demand, an interest from the nations of the region for the United States to play a role.''
As a sign of this, Mr. Obama will join the leaders of 16 other nations for the sixth East Asia Summit meeting in Bali this week, the first time an American president has participated in the forum.
The move is part of a broader strategy to re-embrace multilateralism. In recent years, Washington had come to view Asian regional groups as limiting its ability to act, while China embraced regional partnerships before its rise to regional superpower. Now, those roles appear to have switched. The United States has '' turned the multilateral tables on China,'' said Carlyle A. Thayer, a professor of international relations at the Australian Defense Force Academy.
But multilateralism has taken on an aggressive tinge, some analysts contend. ''Beneath the surface they're becoming an arena for subtle but, for the region, quite unnerving power plays and influence games between the U.S. and China,'' said one analyst in Washington, Michael Green of the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
The more robust American position is proving difficult for many in China to accept.
Global Times, a subsidiary of the Communist Party's flagship newspaper, People's Daily, wrote Tuesday that the United States was trying to ''form a gang'' against China's territorial claims on the South China Sea.
Many Chinese have grown angry over the American moves in the region, which are frequently reported and heavily criticized in the state-controlled press.
''The United States is trying to use the small nations as marionettes,'' said Ge Fen, a Hangzhou-based television producer. ''It's trying to hide behind them to encircle China.''
But many more sober voices are also present.
''If the Chinese government is clever, it would do well to think about the reason why the U.S. is suddenly so popular in the region,'' said Shi Yinhong, director of the Center on American Studies at the Renmin University in Beijing. ''Is it because China has not been good enough when it comes to diplomacy with its neighboring countries?''
There are some signs that China may be adjusting its policies to answer such criticism. Over the past few months, it has shown a renewed willingness to strike more cooperative deals with its neighbors. Last week, it announced that it would join its southeastern neighbors in combating pirates on the lower Mekong River. In July, China set guidelines for implementing a ''declaration on conduct'' with Southeast Asian nations over the resolution of disputes in the South China Sea.
''We're back in a cautiously optimistic position,'' Professor Thayer said.

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A news analysis article on Wednesday about the Obama administration's effort to reassert the American role in the Pacific region referred incorrectly to a diplomatic agreement signed by China and Southeast Asian nations in July. It was a set of guidelines for implementing a ''declaration on conduct'' concerning the resolution of disputes in the South China Sea; it was not the declaration itself, which was signed in November 2002.

HEADLINE: A Dispute Over Scrub-Covered Islands Reflects Philippine and Chinese Tensions

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS

 BODY:
PALAWAN, Philippines -- The rhetorical missiles fired by a state-owned Chinese newspaper late last month landed squarely on the shores of this westernmost province and a few dozen kilometers from the coral reefs and scrub-covered islets claimed by China, the Philippines and a number of other nations.
''If these countries don't want to change their ways with China, they will need to prepare for the sound of cannons,'' wrote the unapologetically nationalistic Global Times, referring to the 750 islands and spits of land in the South China Sea, known as the Spratly Islands, which are also contested by Brunei, Malaysia, Taiwan and Vietnam. 
The following day, a riposte of sorts crackled on the sugar-white sands of Palawan as hundreds of American and Philippine Marines scurried from rubber dinghies and stormed into the adjacent jungle with machine guns blazing. It may have been a drill, but the symbolism was not lost on the throng of Filipino journalists on the beach for the occasion.
Although both militaries said the location and timing were coincidental, the Philippine commander, Maj. Gen. Juancho Sabban, appeared to relish the show of force at a time when China's growing assertiveness has rattled Manila and neighboring governments with claims to the islands.
''The mere deployment of missiles or sound of cannons will not scare us from protecting our own territory,'' General Sabban said as the drill got under way.
China's increasingly muscular claims over the Spratlys and two other island groups -- one off the coast of Vietnam and another closer to Japan -- have also unnerved the United States, which in recent weeks has been telegraphing plans to strengthen its presence in the region. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton made a stopover in Manila on Tuesday to observe the 60th anniversary of the defense treaty that binds the two countries.
But even as it takes comfort in its longstanding alliance with the United States, the Philippines, a former American colony, is eager to find common ground with its giant neighbor to the north, whose growing economic pull it is finding impossible to resist.
Although still relatively modest, Chinese investment in the Philippines doubled last year to $86 million, and bilateral trade, at $30 billion, was up 35 percent. During his first state visit to Beijing in August, President Benigno S. Aquino III took along 200 business leaders and courted investment in the hope that Chinese largess might buoy long-neglected infrastructure projects.
In the months after his June 2010 election, Mr. Aquino made some striking concessions to China. The Philippines was one of the few democratic counties last year to hold back its ambassador from the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony honoring the jailed Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo. A few months later, Manila angered Taiwan by honoring Beijing's request to deport to mainland China 14 fraud suspects who hailed from Taiwan.
But the limits of Manila's influence were revealed shortly after Mr. Aquino's visit, when the mainland Chinese authorities executed three Filipinos accused of drug trafficking despite Mr. Aquino's clemency pleas. The executions, and an increase in skirmishes between fishermen and naval vessels from both countries, have fueled Philippine determination to stand up to Beijing.
Walden Bello, a congressman who made a symbolic touchdown on one of the contested islands last summer, said the Philippines was grappling with the realization that China's economic prowess would probably eclipse that of United States.
''Everybody has been affected by the sense that American power is on the wane and that China's is on the rise,'' he said. ''But the fact that China would make such a brash and astounding claim to the entire South China Sea is disconcerting. I think there's a feeling that we can't allow our economic dependence on China let them trample all over us.''
China does not claim that the entire South China Sea is under its sovereignty. But it does make disputed claims to island territories in the sea that would, if recognized, give it sway over developing resources in large parts of the sea, which are among the world's busiest shipping lanes.
The sea has substantial oil and gas reserves that, if fully developed, could someday rival those of Kuwait. Also at stake are rich fishing grounds that by some estimates supply about a tenth of the world's commercial seafood.
In injecting itself into the dispute -- beginning last year when Mrs. Clinton declared the issue a matter of ''national interest'' -- the United States has emphasized the area's crucial role as a conduit for maritime trade.
Despite its vulnerable economy and a weak military that relies on warships from World War II, the Philippines has not shied away from confrontation. In a gesture of patriotic bravado, government officials and the news media have taken to calling the region the West Philippine Sea, and Mr. Aquino has been vocally asserting claims to the islands, some of which are less than 50 miles off the coast of Palawan but more than 500 miles from China's southernmost province.
''Our message to the world is clear: What is ours is ours. Setting foot on Recto Bank is no different from setting foot on Recto Avenue,'' he said in a recent state of the union address, referring to an oil-rich area 80 miles from Palawan and a prominent thoroughfare in Manila.
Mr. Aquino has ordered increased Coast Guard patrols in Recto Bank -- prompted by an incident in which Chinese ships tried to interfere with Philippine-led oil exploration efforts -- and he has been avidly cementing ties with Vietnam and Japan. He has also been pushing a multilateral approach to resolving the Spratlys dispute, including involving the United Nations, despite China's insistence that each country's claim be tackled through one-on-one negotiation.
Filipinos and the Chinese have ties that reach back centuries. Many of the country's most prominent businessmen are ethnic Chinese, and Mr. Aquino's mother, former President Corazon Aquino, traced her roots to coastal Fujian Province.
Few analysts expect the two countries to go to war over the Spratlys issue, but increasingly frequent skirmishes have kept the issue at a low boil.
''Although there is an appreciation that Aquino is engaged on this issue, the anti-China rhetoric coming from the government is not seen to represent the overall interests of the country,'' said Aileen Baviera, dean of the Asian Center at the University of the Philippines. ''Tough talk from a country with a very small stick is not always very pragmatic.''

HEADLINE: Jolted, Wall St. Protesters Face Challenge For Future: Ousted by Police, Then Allowed to Return

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER and MICHAEL BARBARO; Reporting was contributed by Al Baker, James Barron, David W. Chen, Matt Flegenheimer, Joseph Goldstein, Thomas Kaplan, Sharon Otterman and Kate Taylor.

 BODY:
Emergency-service trucks rumbled up Broadway to positions on two sides of Zuccotti Park. Powerful klieg lights blinked on, illuminating about 220 protesters in tents and sleeping bags. The one-square-block plaza was as bright as day. But it was only 1 a.m.
Voices of the police, booming from loudspeakers, echoed through the financial district. Officers swept through the park, picking their way around tents and over sleeping bags, handing out leaflets. Dozens of protesters linked arms and shouted ''This is our home,'' ''Barricade!'' and, in one case, ''You're stepping on my bed!''
But the message was clear: Occupy Wall Street's two-month encampment was coming to a sudden end.
The eviction early Tuesday morning, which ended with the arrests of 140 bleary-eyed protesters who had not heeded the orders to clear out, capped two intense weeks in which Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and his aides tried but failed to negotiate with members of Occupy Wall Street. They concluded that the protesters were unwilling to negotiate and unable to address their encampment's growing problems on their own. 
On Tuesday evening, after a judge agreed that officials could ban tents and tarps, several hundred protesters without sleeping gear returned to the park in Lower Manhattan, began to meet and prepared for an uncertain future.
''I think everyone's still in the processing mode,'' said Nate Barchus, 23, a protester from Providence, R.I., who acknowledged feeling rage and disappointment. ''This will be a catalyst. This reminds everyone who was occupying exactly why they were occupying.''
The predawn operation, overseen by Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, followed a series of crackdowns by exasperated mayors across the country; many of them had initially tolerated the movement, which criticized the nation's economic inequality, but then wearied as the encampments became increasingly disruptive.
Mr. Bloomberg's order to clear out the encampment prompted criticism as well as praise. Some neighbors and business owners, glimpsing park pavement for the first time in weeks, seemed relieved, while various liberal politicians, labor leaders and civil libertarians denounced the move as an unjustified infringement on free speech.
There were ''a number of people inside there, some of them reporters, that were detained just walking on the sidewalk,'' said a council member, Ydanis Rodriguez, who was among those arrested two blocks from the park early Tuesday. Mr. Rodriguez was held until 8 p.m., when he emerged from a courthouse with scrapes on his hand and above his right eye, and a large scab on the left side of his face, and alleged that he was assaulted by a police officer. ''This is not acceptable,'' he said.
For the mayor, a champion of the First Amendment who made a fortune on Wall Street and defends its virtues, the decision was even more freighted: just a month ago, he announced that the city would clear the park for cleaning, but backed down after a chorus of political protest and an influx of new demonstrators.
On Monday, the city took extraordinary steps to keep its plan secret and preserve the element of surprise, leaving members of the mayor's staff, local politicians and even police commanders in the dark. This time, there would be no warning.
The administration had tried to avoid such a confrontation with behind-the-scenes diplomacy.
After weeks of fruitlessly trying to talk to the protesters through intermediaries, Deputy Mayor Howard Wolfson, the mayor's top political aide, said he was thrilled when he received a call in mid-October from Rabbi Peter J. Rubinstein of Central Synagogue in Midtown Manhattan. The rabbi, who is the chairman of the Partnership of Faith, an interreligious group of senior city clerics, had been approached by members of the demonstration's ''comfort working group'' seeking the city's permission to set up tents and portable toilets.
Mr. Wolfson agreed to a meeting immediately, but it took two weeks to arrange one with the demonstrators, the rabbi said.
On Oct. 31, Mr. Wolfson sat down in a carpeted conference room owned by Trinity Church across a table from five members of the protest, an imam and the rabbi looking on.
Mr. Wolfson hoped to work through the Bloomberg administration's problems with what it saw as an increasingly lawless and unmanageable campground in the pulsing heart of the financial district. The protesters wanted to discuss only the need for toilets and tents. Mr. Wolfson told them their requests for permits had been denied, and the negotiations were over before they had begun.
''The city was interested in engaging in a dialogue,'' Mr. Wolfson said. ''It was made clear that that was not something that Occupy Wall Street was willing to do.''
Han Shan, a protest member, said he had volunteered to attend specifically to make sure his compatriots were not lured into negotiations that no one in the movement was authorized to conduct. He said the exchange demonstrated that the mayor's office did not understand how Occupy Wall Street functioned.
''The mayor's office had made it very clear that they were hoping to talk with Occupy Wall Street to negotiate and have people to speak with,'' he said. ''But there was no one empowered in any process in Occupy Wall Street to engage in that dialogue.''
The Bloomberg administration's concerns mounted quickly after the failed meeting, fueled by increasing disorder in the park. And periodic visits to the park, as well as nightly viewings of the protesters' meetings streamed live on the Internet, convinced city officials that the protest was becoming ever more unruly, unsafe and ungovernable.
Two days after the church meeting, a man was charged with sexually abusing an 18-year-old woman at Zuccotti Park, and Mr. Bloomberg's public tone began to shift. Facing mounting criticism from the city's tabloids and from some business interests for his tolerance of an encampment they found increasingly noxious, he spoke increasingly of the need to balance free speech with public safety.
The mayor and his advisers had grown fed up with their inability to police the park, with complaints about noise, disruptions to businesses and odors, and with a leaderless movement that they just could not figure out how to deal with.
As Mr. Wolfson put it in an interview, ''The issues were not resolvable.''
Then last week, an emergency medical worker was allegedly assaulted by a man whom the police were trying to take into custody at the park. If the mayor was looking for a reason to act, he now had it.
''It was a serious incident that pointed to a serious problem,'' Mr. Wolfson said. The situation, he added, was ''clearly headed in the wrong direction.''
And there were other factors too. The protesters were threatening to disrupt the stock exchange and city subways on Thursday with demonstrations marking their two months' occupation of Zuccotti Park. City officials could not imagine how the protesters would leave voluntarily -- even with winter approaching -- because other demonstrators were watching from around the world and there was no way for the New York group to simply declare victory and walk away.
On Sunday morning, the mayor summoned his police and fire chiefs and other senior aides to Gracie Mansion, and a consensus in favor of evicting the protesters emerged.
And on Monday -- the mayor's aides declined to say exactly when -- Mr. Bloomberg gave the order to move in. City officials noted that Brookfield Properties, the company that owns the park, had asked the city to help it clear out the tents, but it was not clear whether the company's request preceded or followed the mayor's decision.
''Inaction was not an option,'' the mayor said on Tuesday morning. ''I could not wait for someone in the park to get killed or to injure another first responder before acting.''
Most of the mayor's staff on Monday was proceeding with plans for Mr. Bloomberg to travel to Washington to speak at a Congressional conference on philanthropy. But after 4 p.m., aides said, some began to sense that something related to Occupy Wall Street was about to take place.
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo was alerted to the operation on Monday night. The Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, whose district includes Zuccotti Park, said a member of his staff got a phone call at 1:30 a.m., after the police had already begun their sweep.
Only after 5:30 a.m., when the eviction operation was a fait accompli, did many other officials hear from City Hall about what had transpired.
Julie Menin, the chairwoman of the Lower Manhattan community board, said Mr. Wolfson called at 6:30 a.m. to inform her of the obvious: ''He was very matter-of-fact,'' she said. ''He said: 'I am calling you to update you on what we did. We came in the middle of the night.' ''

HEADLINE: Obama's Shift on Mandate May Be Health Law's Undoing

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- As Barack Obama battled Hillary Rodham Clinton over health care during the Democratic presidential primaries of 2008, he was adamant about one thing: Americans, he insisted, should not be required to buy health insurance.
''If things were that easy,'' Mr. Obama told the talk show host Ellen DeGeneres in February of that year, ''I could mandate everybody to buy a house, and that would solve the problem of homelessness. It doesn't.''
Now President Obama may wish he had stuck to those words. On Monday, the Supreme Court agreed to take up a constitutional challenge to his landmark health care bill, and a decision could come in the midst of Mr. Obama's 2012 re-election campaign.
At the heart of the challenge is ''the mandate'' -- a provision requiring nearly all Americans to buy coverage or pay a penalty -- that he so vigorously opposed as a candidate. If it is struck down, much of his signature legislative achievement could fall with it in a decision that would undoubtedly be construed as a rebuke to the president. 
Polls show the mandate is by far the most unpopular provision of the 2010 bill, and now Mr. Obama, who ultimately embraced the idea, is in the awkward position of defending something he once rejected.
''I think his political instincts were right,'' said Paul Starr, a health policy expert at Princeton University who argues that it is possible to expand coverage by other means. ''I think he saw that there could be a backlash against a mandate and that there needed to be some other kind of approach. So in a way, I'm sorry he didn't stick to his original position.''
The theory behind the mandate, according to its proponents, is this: Requiring coverage brings both sick and healthy people into the pool of those insured, which is essential because premiums paid by the healthy offset the cost of covering the sick. Otherwise, healthy people wait until they are ill to buy insurance, which leads to what policy analysts call a ''death spiral'' in which premiums skyrocket out of control.
As a candidate, Mr. Obama did favor requiring all children to have insurance. Once he took office, his top aides began examining other options, said Ezekiel J. Emanuel, a former health policy adviser to Mr. Obama. The aides studied the experience of Massachusetts, which has a mandate, and health laws in other states that do not. They considered voluntary incentives to get healthy people to enroll.
Their internal modeling, Dr. Emanuel said, showed that a mandate would extend coverage to 32 million uninsured people. Without such a requirement, he said, the administration estimated it could cover 16 million people at three-fourths the cost of covering the 32 million. In the face of such evidence, Mr. Obama reversed himself.
''I don't think it was a slam-dunk,'' said Dr. Emanuel, now a vice provost at the University of Pennsylvania and a regular contributor to The New York Times's Op-Ed page. ''The president did take very seriously his reputation for following what he said, so he was very reluctant to change his opinion unless he was very convinced.''
Health insurers also insisted on a mandate, as did the Democrats who controlled Congress. In July 2009, Mr. Obama told CBS News that he was ''now in favor of some sort of individual mandate as long as there's a hardship exemption'' for people who truly could not afford to buy insurance.
While the White House may have been prepared for the public unhappiness over the provision, it appears to have been caught off guard by the constitutional challenge -- in part because Obama advisers regarded the mandate as a conservative notion. The idea gained currency in the early 1990s, when some Republicans proposed their own version of an ''individual mandate'' as an alternative to the ''employer mandate'' in President Bill Clinton's health plan.
Polls show that the individual mandate is unpopular. The Kaiser Family Foundation, which tracks public opinion on the health measure, reported in March that 74 percent of Americans would keep, rather than repeal, the law's provision barring insurers from discriminating against people with pre-existing conditions. But only 27 percent would keep the mandate. (A CNN poll released Monday found that 52 percent supported the mandate, up from 44 percent in June, though unlike Kaiser, CNN did not explain that failure to comply would result in a fine.)
The Obama administration insists that if the mandate falls, so does the provision on pre-existing conditions. ''The mandate,'' said Jonathan Gruber, a health economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has advised the administration, ''is the spinach you need to get the chocolate you want.''
Chris Jennings, a former health policy adviser to Mr. Clinton, makes much the same point. ''Health reform without an individual requirement,'' Mr. Jennings says, ''is like driving a train without tracks; you can still move, but you can't get to your coverage destination and it will be a rougher and far more costly trip.''
But not all economists agree. Some say the government has other ways to make sure that enough healthy people buy insurance and offset the cost of the sick. One option is ''auto enrollment,'' in which the government would automatically enroll citizens in insurance plans, but give them the chance to opt out. Mr. Starr, the Princeton professor, who helped draft the Clinton health bill, proposes a system of penalties and incentives to get healthy people to enroll. For instance, people could be given a choice: Sign up now, or wait another five years.
Of the four appeals courts that have weighed the constitutionality of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, only one has struck it down. The most recent decision, issued last week by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, upheld the law. The Supreme Court decision will almost certainly thrust health care back into the public debate next year. But its effect on Mr. Obama's re-election campaign remains to be seen.
Professor Starr says a finding that the mandate is unconstitutional would be a ''severe blow'' to the act, and the Obama presidency.
But Drew Altman, the president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, said health policy rarely affected election outcomes. ''If any health care issue is a voting issue,'' Mr. Altman said, ''it's not health reform, it's Medicare.''
Some experts say that if the bill had imposed a tax on Americans who did not have insurance -- rather than requiring them to buy a policy -- the entire legal fight might have been avoided.
''It's a little bit surprising that the constitutional arguments weren't out there sooner,'' said Mark McClellan, who ran Medicare under President George W. Bush. ''They could have written it in a way that would have better overcome the constitutional challenges.''
That may be what the Supreme Court orders. But for Mr. Obama, it may be too late. The Republican leaders in Congress want to repeal the bill, not rewrite it.

HEADLINE: Retailers See a Split In Behavior Of Shoppers

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD

 BODY:
At Wal-Mart, shoppers cut back on staples like milk and meat that had price increases of a few cents. At Saks Fifth Avenue, they paid full price for shoes and designer fashions at a rate higher than before the recession.
As several big chains reported third-quarter results on Tuesday, the divide between hard-pressed and prosperous Americans remained a defining characteristic of the retail economy. 
''Clearly it's a bifurcated market,'' said Stephen I. Sadove, chairman and chief executive of Saks, in an interview. ''The high-end consumer is much more tied to the stock market and the Dow and how they're feeling about their personal situation, more so than the lower end of the market,'' where concerns about gas prices and unemployment were more prevalent.
Over all, retail sales last month were higher than analysts had expected, rising 0.5 percent, according to the Commerce Department, contributing to the third-quarter results reported Tuesday. But Jay H. Bryson, an economist at Wells Fargo, predicted that the growth would soon slow as consumers stop using their savings, rather than their income, to pay for goods.
''Growth in nominal income is relatively weak,'' Mr. Bryson wrote in a note to clients, and ''the increase in food and energy prices over the past year has eroded consumer purchasing power.''
Wal-Mart, the country's biggest retailer, said it had posted a quarterly increase in sales at stores open at least a year after nine consecutive quarters of declines in that important measure. But its third-quarter profit took a hit as the retailer chose not to pass on all of its price increases to consumers.
Company executives said they were not confident that Wal-Mart shoppers could afford more expensive goods.
''Our customers are still feeling pressured to reduce expenses wherever they can,'' said William S. Simon, president and chief executive of Wal-Mart United States. ''Cost increases in numerous categories were not passed on to our customers in the form of increased prices.''
At the other end of the retail spectrum, Saks said Tuesday that its revenue had risen 5 percent, to $692.3 million, from the same quarter a year ago. Its same-store sales, sales for stores open at least a year, rose 5.8 percent.
''Full-price selling is at record levels,'' Mr. Sadove said. ''We're now in a less promotional environment than we were before the recession.''
At Saks, profit fell by 51 percent, to $17.8 million, in the quarter. But that was a tough comparison with the third quarter of 2010, when profit was pumped up by a gain related to tax reserves.
Some areas where Saks had placed big inventory bets, like shoes, turned out particularly well in the quarter, he said.
''If you look at it in the first half of the year, our same-store sales were up 13 percent,'' Mr. Sadove said. ''If you look at the third quarter, it was not quite as strong as you saw in the first half of the year. Maybe that was tempered by the stock market volatility. Having said that, you still had very strong consumption on the part of the luxury consumer -- it wasn't as though it was flailing about.''
Mr. Simon said Wal-Mart shoppers seemed especially worried about food prices -- Wal-Mart's food costs rose 4 percent over the last quarter, though it passed on ''substantially less'' to consumers via grocery prices.
''We hear from some shoppers that they believe it will be more difficult than ever to afford holiday meals for their families,'' he said. ''We understand their concern, and we see it every month in our customers' purchasing behavior.''
In another sign of tight consumer budgets, Wal-Mart's layaway program for holiday gifts, which it began offering in October after a hiatus of several years, has exceeded projections for the number of layaway transactions so far.
''This is one of the top areas that the customer had asked us to bring back to help meet their needs for the holiday season,'' said Jeff Davis, senior vice president and treasurer, in a call with reporters. ''What we have seen is, once again, this bevy of activity out there particularly in layaway and the traffic it brings to our stores.''
Wal-Mart said its domestic same-store sales increased by 1.3 percent, above its projections. That compared with a 1.3 percent decline in the same quarter a year ago.
However, profit fell 2.9 percent from a year ago to $3.3 billion, below analysts' expectations.
Executives said that while visits to Wal-Mart's stores in the United States fell from the same quarter a year ago, shoppers were spending more each visit. Net sales domestically increased 2.7 percent to $63.8 billion.
Home Depot executives said that although the housing market showed little buoyancy, its customers were spending a bit more on refurbishing their homes.
The average ticket, or amount on a receipt, grew 3 percent in the quarter from the same period in 2010, while transactions increased by 1.2 percent.
Part of that was related to the storms in recent months, with people buying expensive items like generators and roofing supplies. But they were also spending on areas like kitchens. ''Our consumers continue to want to maintain their homes,'' chief financial officer Carol B. Tome said in an interview.
Home Depot posted a profit of 60 cents a share on Tuesday, beating analysts' expectations of 58 to 59 cents a share. Its sales rose 4.4 percent to $17.3 billion, and it had a 4.2 percent increase in same-store sales.
Whether their consumers are feeling pressured or flush now, the retail executives indicated they did not expect things to change soon.
''In the U.S., we still do not see, and do not expect to see in the near term, any meaningful tailwind from the housing market,'' said Frank Blake, Home Depot's chairman and chief executive.
''I feel good about the luxury consumer,'' Mr. Sadove of Saks said.
Referring to the Wal-Mart shopper's dependence on paychecks and government-assistance payments rather than savings, Mr. Davis said that ''going forward we really would not expect anything different.''

HEADLINE: The Sharp Increase in the Food Stamps Program

BYLINE: CASEY B. MULLIGAN


HIGHLIGHT: Changes in policy and law, as well as the weak economy, more than doubled the amount spent on food stamps between 2007 and 2010, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
The poor economy is not the only reason that safety-net programs are spending more. The food stamp program is another example of a safety-net program that is significantly more costly than it was before the recession began.
The Department of Agriculture's food stamp program, now known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, provides money to low-income households for the purpose of buying food, often in conjunction with cash assistance programs. Adjusting for inflation, the program spent more than twice as much in 2010 as it did in 2007, before the recession began.
The Department of Agriculture found that the food-stamp spending increase "is likely attributable to the deterioration of the economy, expansions in SNAP eligibility, and continued outreach efforts." Of particular relevance for the SNAP program is the fact that the poverty rate increased 18 percent, to 153 per thousand in 2010 from 130 per thousand Americans in 2007.

At least two eligibility expansions have occurred since the recession began: work requirements were lifted from April 1, 2009, through Sept. 30, 2010, and monthly income limits were 10 percent higher in the 2010 fiscal year than they were in the 2007 fiscal year, an increase about twice the rate of inflation over that period. 
In addition, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act increased maximum benefits by 13.6 percent, and the minimum benefit increased in October 2008. Increasingly, potential program participants have been given the opportunity to apply for benefits on the Internet.
The declining economy alone, under the previous rules, would have raised the spending on food stamps by 18 percent. But the revised provisions, enacted largely in response to the recession, are responsible for a greater share of the increase. The following table breaks down the program's spending growth into three components: deterioration of the economy, relaxed eligibility rules and increased maximum benefits.
The top row of the table is actual program spending for 2007 and 2010, adjusting for inflation and population. The second row of the table estimates the program's hypothetical spending growth with 2007 eligibility rules, by assuming that real spending per capita increased since 2007 only in proportion to increases in the poverty rate, plus the 13.6 percent benefit increase of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The last row assumes that real spending per capita increased only with the poverty rate. Under either scenario, the hypothetical spending increases are significant but well less than half of the actual spending increases.
Over all, the table suggests that most growth in spending on SNAP is due to changes in eligibility rules and increases in payments per eligible person. The program's spending would certainly have grown if benefit rules had remained as they were in 2007, but much less than it actually did. And those more generous provisions are now likely to be here to stay, even if the conditions that prompted them abate.

HEADLINE: The Early Line on Early Applications for the Class of 2016

BYLINE: JACQUES STEINBERG and REBECCA R. RUIZ


HIGHLIGHT: Many of the nation's most selective private colleges and universities, including Brown, Cornell and Northwestern, are reporting yet another increase in requests by applicants to lock in their acceptances early. 

 BODY:
The window for applying to many colleges and universities under early admission programs closed late Tuesday night. While it will be some time before a definitive statistical portrait emerges of this early admissions season, The Choice has been dutifully requesting application figures from a range of more than 100 institutions. The chart above, which we'll be updating regularly as other figures trickle in, represents the equivalent of early returns in an election, with results from two dozen "precincts."
Such programs have been hotly-debated in academic circles for years. Some high school counselors argue that they unnecessarily speed up students' decision process, favor the savvy (including those with access to the most sophisticated college counseling) and -- in the case of so-called binding early decision plans -- restrict applicants' efforts to compare financial aid offers (because students applying to binding programs agree in advance to enroll if accepted). The colleges and universities (and many students) have a different take: such programs reward those applicants and institutions that are willing to make a definitive decision early in the admissions process. It is not unusual for a private college to admit a quarter or more of its freshman class early.
If the figures gathered thus far are any indication, such programs are continuing to grow in popularity this fall, despite a sluggish economy that would otherwise seem to give families reason to hedge their bets. But every year serves as a reminder that the quest to get into the nation's most competitive private colleges is often immune to the economic pressures on many families. For example, applications under binding early decision programs increased by 20 percent at Boston University, to 1,057; by 15 percent at Northwestern, to 2,450; by 5.5 percent at Brown, to almost 3,000 (for a total freshman class of 1,500); by nearly 4 percent at Cornell, to 3,609; and by 8 percent at William & Mary, to 1,167. The Choice reported last week that applications to Duke's binding early decision program were up 23 percent, and that the comparable figure at Johns Hopkins was 15 percent.
While applications to most colleges reporting thus far -- whether under early decision or non-binding early action -- are up, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology said applications under its early action program had fallen nearly 5 percent, to 6,100; and Rensselaer Polytechnic and the University of Pennsylvania said applications under its binding early decision programs had fallen by 7 percent and just under 1 percent, respectively. 
In the case of UPenn, several factors appeared to be in play, Eric J. Furda, the dean of admissions, said in an interview. One was that the university was coming off a nearly 20 percent increase in early applications in 2010, when compared to 2009. "I feel we're approaching an upper limit,'' Mr. Furda said, citing the national economy as a prod.
But he also acknowledged that UPenn had likely lost several dozen potential early applicants to Princeton and Harvard, each of which restored early admission programs this fall after a four-year hiatus. The Princeton and Harvard programs are not binding (students who are accepted early can wait until as late as May 1 to decide whether to attend) but students are prohibited from applying early to any other private college. The Choice reported last week that Princeton had received more than 3,500 applications under its so-called "single choice" early action program. We'll be sure to pass along figures from Harvard as soon as we receive them.
Colleges and universities can send their figures for consideration for publication, using the format above, to thechoicenyt@gmail.com Readers can continue to check back on this post for updates to that chart.

HEADLINE: Power Surge: 650 Horsepower for the Shelby GT500

BYLINE: JERRY GARRETT


HIGHLIGHT: The range-topping Shelby is claimed by Ford to have the most powerful production V-8 in the world. 

 BODY:
Shown on Tuesday: 2013 Ford Mustang Shelby GT500.
What is it? The latest bid in the Ford Mustang vs. Chevy Camaro poker game of "I see your 580 horsepower and raise you another 70." The GT500 caps a line of otherwise lightly refreshed Mustangs for the 2013 model year.
What they said: "People always ask me which is my favorite Mustang of all time," said Carroll Shelby, the famed racer and car builder. "I always tell them, 'The next one.' Well, with this one, I have to change that. My favorite is this one."
What they didn't say: Mr. Shelby, whose 89th birthday will be on Jan. 11, is not likely to undertake another vehicle project of this scope and magnitude. His medical history includes a heart transplant, and he is described as being in delicate health.
What makes it tick? A supercharged 5.8-liter V-8 that produces a claimed 650 horsepower and 600 pound-feet of torque, coupled to a 6-speed manual transmission. Does that seem like a lot? It is; Ford says it is the most powerful production V-8 in the world. In response to questions whether its top speed is indeed 200 m.p.h., Jim Farley, the Ford vice president of marketing and communications, replied, "No, it's well over 200!" Yet, he promised it would be economical enough to drive on the street every day, while avoiding the federal gas-guzzler tax.
How much, how soon? Sales are expected to begin next summer, at a price that is still an unlisted number. In addition to being the fastest Mustang ever, expect it to be the most expensive. By far.
How's it look? Against the backdrop of an environmentally sensitive auto show, like a devil with a blue dress on at a church revival meeting.

HEADLINE: In Los Angeles, Driving the Dark Horse in the Green Car of the Year Sweepstakes

BYLINE: JERRY GARRETT


HIGHLIGHT: The Honda Civic Natural Gas sedan, revised for 2012, is not the most dynamic road performer, but it continues to run laps around competitors at the pump. 

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- The 2012 Green Car of the Year Award will be presented Thursday at the Los Angeles auto show. The diverse field of finalists includes two all-electric vehicles, a gasoline-electric hybrid, a diesel-powered model and another that runs on compressed natural gas, or CNG.
This week, I have the opportunity to test-drive the CNG entry, the 2012 Honda Civic Natural Gas sedan; the other finalists are the Ford Focus Electric, Toyota Prius V, Mitsubishi i and the Volkswagen Passat TDI.
First, the pluses, which are considerable. At an Arco station in Laguna Niguel on Tuesday, I was able to fill the car's tank for $11.62, the gasoline-cost equivalent of $1.92 a gallon. In the Rocky Mountains, where CNG is more widely available, it is still possible to fill up for under $1 a gallon.
The car's handy navigation system helped me locate and map a route to the Arco, though it did list it as a Shell station.
The car's range has been increased over the outgoing Civic GX natural gas model. That car barely went 200 miles on a tank of CNG; 211 was my personal best. The new one is advertised as having a 248-mile range, which is based on the combined mileage of 31 miles per gallon, with a fuel tank capacity equivalent to eight gallons.
Ratings for the 2012 model from the Environmental Protection Agency are equivalent to about 38 m.p.g. highway and 27 in the city, representing a 10.7 percent improvement in combined fuel economy over the GX, according to Honda. That is comparable to a gasoline-powered Civic, and I actually observed a bit better mileage than that.
And in a boon for California owners, the Civic Natural Gas is welcome in the state's coveted car-pool lanes with only one occupant in the car. Gasoline-electric hybrids like the Civic Hybrid and Toyota Prius lost that privilege on July 1.
Now, for the minuses. The Civic Natural Gas is based on the newest Civic, which made its debut earlier this year to a shocking amount of scorn. A perennial member of recommended lists published by automotive publications, it was unceremoniously dumped by many who dinged it for its cheap-feeling interior, poor ride and handling and sluggish engine. And the 110-horsepower, 1.8-liter engine on the Civic Natural Gas is, indeed, sluggish.
The previous GX was originally intended for only fleet use, but it made its way into the retail arena with a small cult following. It was outfitted like a fleet vehicle, with a primitive interior, lumpy and unsupportive seats, and almost no options. The 2012 model, it was promised, would be more like the normal Civic. That's now true, although some would argue that this was achieved only because Honda skewed the new Civic lower, toward the GX's fleet-caliber quality, not vice versa.
The price has risen, too, up to $26,925 (the navigation system on the test car adds $1,500 to that price). That's more than a $10,000 mark-up above the price of a base gasoline-powered model. It does, to be fair, include more standard features than the outgoing GX. But it would seem most of those added features aren't free, but rather priced in. The CNG-powered Civic is, however, the lowest priced among this year's field of award candidates.
Still, the cult of CNG lovers in this country is somewhat mollified by Honda's continued support, no matter how limited, of the genre. The Civic is the last CNG model still offered by a new-car manufacturer in North America. Other automakers, who used to offer CNG vehicles, or so-called dual-fuel models that would run on either CNG or gasoline, have discontinued them.
The lack of a wider range of new CNG models is distressing for those who claim CNG is the best near-term solution for high energy prices, dependence on foreign sources of oil and for reductions in air pollution. Supporters claim it is the cleanest-burning auto fuel, and the Civic Natural Gas is granted Partial Zero Emissions Vehicle status in California.
Meanwhile, the network of CNG refueling stations is expanding nationwide, and so is the sales network; Civic Natural Gas is now available in 36 states. There is also a robust market for used CNG and dual-fuel vehicles, and a cottage industry of mechanics converting gasoline vehicles to run on CNG is growing.
Despite the new Civic's deficiencies, this natural gas version is a compelling candidate in Thursday's green car pageant. It must be considered something of a dark horse, though. Maybe a trophy would inspire other automakers into revisiting their decision to discontinue CNG models.
I, for one, will miss reading "$11.62" on the fuel pump's digital display.

HEADLINE: Reader Feedback: Why American Migration Might Be Falling

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: A new study finds that the decline in mobility rates within the United States long predates the recent recession, and suggests some possible explanations. 

 BODY:
In response to my post Tuesday on the record low level of migration in the United States last year, an astute reader referred me to a recent paper in The Journal of Economic Perspectives on this subject.
The study -- by Raven Molloy, Christopher L. Smith and Abigail Wozniak -- notes that the drop in mobility has been going on since the 1980s, and so should not be attributed to the recent downturn. Based on statistical analysis, it also argues that the trend seems to be unrelated to "demographics, income, employment, labor force participation, or homeownership." Americans are, however, still more likely to move than Europeans, for unknown reasons.
The authors are unsure why migration rates have been falling so steadily in the United States. They suggest a few possible theories, including:

        
the rise in telecommuting and flexible work schedules, which require fewer workers to move to take a job.
        
 the fact that different cities and states have become less specialized in the products they produce, which makes the kinds of occupations available in different areas more similar than they used to be. In other words, people don't need to move to a different region of the country to do the kind of work they want to do.
        
that differences between different regions in terms of quality of living and other amenities offered have declined, reducing the relative attractiveness of any particular city (e.g., the availability of air-conditioning)
Any other theories, readers?

HEADLINE: Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 Puts the Power, and the Top, Down

BYLINE: JERRY GARRETT


HIGHLIGHT: Chevrolet says the 580-horsepower ZL1 convertible can sprint to 60 miles per hour in 3.9 seconds. 

 BODY:
Shown on Wednesday, Nov. 16: 2013 Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 convertible.
What is it? A tire-melting top dog for Chevrolet's popular Camaro line, the open-air edition.
Is it real? Yes, it goes into production next year; a ZL1 coupe was previously announced and is scheduled to enter production in early 2012. Convertible sales follow late next year.
What they said: "The Camaro ZL1 convertible will be one of the most powerful and most capable convertibles available at any price," said Al Oppenheiser, the car's chief engineer, at a preview showing of the car on the eve of press previews for the Los Angeles auto show. "This car is guaranteed to put a smile on your face any time you drop the top or hit the gas."
What they didn't say: Exactly how hard the ZL1 will hit the gas. Fuel economy figures have not been released for either coupe or convertible versions, but each is flirting with incurring the federal gas-guzzler tax. That would be a bit of a black eye, especially because Ford expected its 650-horsepower 2013 Shelby GT500 to avoid the tax. Chevrolet said the ZL1 had been geared for maximum efficiency, but with a top speed in excess of 180 m.p.h., fuel economy would probably not be a major purchase consideration for prospective buyers.
What makes it tick? A supercharged 6.2-liter V-8 that produces a whopping 580 horsepower and 556 pound-feet of torque. It comes with either a 6-speed manual or automatic, and contrary to logic, the automatic actually beats the manual in a drag race -- 3.9 seconds to 4.0 in a zero to 60 m.p.h. sprint, and 12 seconds to 12.1 in the quarter mile. Remember when a Dodge Viper seemed all-powerful, with its 500 horsepower?
How much? How soon? The ZL1 convertible, at $54,995, costs far less than a Viper or a lot of other vehicles that Chevrolet cites as competitors: the $200,000 Audi R8 GT, the $125,000 Maserati GranTurismo and the $185,000 Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG. That's nonsense, of course. Still, Camaro whips them on price, and all of those models get stomped -- thoroughly -- by the ZL1 on power output.
How's it look? Like a body builder in a designer suit -- ready to flex its muscles and rip out all the seams.

HEADLINE: Shooting for Global Change

BYLINE: JAMES ESTRIN


HIGHLIGHT: Antonio Amendola has harnessed the fervor of socially concerned amateur photographers to create Shoot 4 Change, a nonprofit that digs into social issues through photography. 

 BODY:
Some serious photographers might cringe at being called amateurs. Not Antonio Amendola - he wears the badge proudly.
A lawyer by trade and a photographer by choice, he once organized a workshop in his hometown of Bari, Italy, entitled "On the Seriousness of Amateur Photography."
"If you study Latin and Greek, you know that the word amateur comes from the word ," Mr. Amendola said. "So they are the ones who really love photography. We take the title 'amateur photography' very seriously."
He has harnessed the fervor of socially concerned amateur photographers to create , a nonprofit that uses photography to explore little-covered issues while helping small associations and nongovernmental organizations promote their work.
Shoot 4 Change, made up of idealistic amateurs and some professional photographers, has dug into stories on homelessness, hunger, malnutrition and most recently economic distress and related civil unrest in Italy, the United States and elsewhere.
"There are hundreds of small associations, small groups of people, volunteers, that do really good work and need their stories told," said Mr. Amendola, 41. "There are stories that want to be told, and stories that need to be told. Must be told."
Mr. Amendola started his group shortly after the L'Aquila earthquake in central Italy in 2009. His blog on the earthquake's victims and photography got the attention of many photographers who wanted to volunteer. It has now morphed into a group with over 700 members throughout Italy and in New York, San Francisco and Argentina. He has also enlisted some professional photographers - including Antonio Politano, Ed Kashi, Rajibul Sheik Islam and Alfons Rodriguez - to join.
Photographers are available - at no charge - for volunteer groups and nonprofits that can't afford photo coverage of their work. If newspapers, magazines or publishers want to use the images, their payment is split, with 60 percent going to the photographer and 40 percent to Shoot 4 Change, which uses the money to defray expenses and support social projects.
He recently started a project highlighting how economic turmoil has affected job prospects for students, the unemployed and underemployed - a generation that is "losing visibility." The concept is to get people throughout the world to send in low resolution or pixelated photographs of themselves along with a description of how much money they live on monthly. Shoot 4 Change is setting up a Web site and a Facebook page dedicated to the project, which is called "The Low Resolution Generation."
He said he wants to keep the organization nonpolitical and totally independent, even from sponsorship or advertising.
Mr. Amendola still works full-time as a lawyer, but he spends an equal amount of time on strengthening Shoot 4 Change and encouraging photographers to help to change the world.
"I use the motto, 'Shoot local, change global,'" he said.

HEADLINE: Mazda CX-5 Aims at the Compact-Crossover Market

BYLINE: JERRY GARRETT


HIGHLIGHT: With its Skyactiv suite of efficiency-bolstering technologies, the CX-5 will battle the redesigned Ford Escape and Honda CR-V, as well as the Toyota RAV4, for sales leadership in the United States. 

 BODY:
Introduced on Wednesday, Nov. 16: 2013 Mazda CX-5 crossover.
Is it real? Real enough to have already been extensively driven in its production form by journalists two months ago for road test reviews.
What they said: "The 2013 CX-5 is the vehicle that compact-S.U.V. shoppers have been asking for -- that only Mazda can build," said Jim O'Sullivan, president and chief executive of Mazda North America. "With its Skyactiv underpinnings and best-in-class fuel economy, CX-5 proves that fun needn't be sacrificed for fuel efficiency and that compact doesn't equate to compromise."
What they didn't say: Mazda is betting heavily on the success of the Skyactiv engine (gasoline for now, with a diesel expected later). The company says it has no plans to bring hybrids or electric vehicles to the United States, giving it no presence among buyers of zero-emissions cars when most every other manufacturer is furiously developing such power trains.
What makes it tick? A Skyactiv-G two-liter gasoline engine, with a compression ratio of 13:1. It makes 155 horsepower and 150 pound-feet of torque, and mates to either a six-speed automatic or manual. With an E.P.A. rating of 26 m.p.g. city and 33 on the highway, Mazda claims that the CX-5 achieves best-in-class fuel economy. An all-wheel-drive version gets 25/30.
How much? How soon? Scheduled to go on sale in February 2012 at a price around $20,000, although no exact figure was disclosed. It will be priced below the CX-7, of course, which is the next model up in Mazda's crossover food chain.
How's it look? Unremarkable, and nothing out of the ordinary for a crossover vehicle, especially one intended to showcase Kodo, the brand's new design language. But Mazda continues to expand its lineup of such vehicles for one very important reason: They sell.

HEADLINE: Religious Groups Offer Help to Evicted Protesters

BYLINE: SHARON OTTERMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Clergy of several faiths are supporting the Occupy Wall Street movement, by giving food, advice and places to sleep. 

 BODY:
A loose coalition of religious leaders from around the city, calling themselves Occupy Faith, are trying to assist the Occupy Wall Street protesters, who are now barred from sleeping overnight at Zuccotti Park in Lower Manhattan.
The coalition, made up of more than 100 priests, ministers, rabbis and imams who have signed a pledge of support for the movement, includes clergy who had helped run the protesters' kitchen at the park in the last two months. Others led religious services or gave organizational advice. And in the last 48 hours, as the protests move into a new and uncertain phase, some opened their houses of worship to demonstrators as places of rest, or stood beside them as they confronted the police around the city.
Judson Memorial Church near Washington Square Park has become an informal center of Occupy Faith, and the congregation's leadership is giving space to the protest movement as it tries to regain its footing. The church has pledged to permit up to 100 protesters to sleep in its cramped Parish Hall from Wednesday night through Saturday morning. The church ministers hope this move will help the demonstrators until they can set up camp either back in Zuccotti Park or elsewhere.
"They have to continue their deliberations and protest," said the Rev. Donna Schaper, the senior minister at Judson, who criticized the early-morning police raid of the camp Tuesday. "It can't end with 'You guys are toast, goodbye'."
Judson is not set up to run a shelter, but church members have been doing what they can over the last two nights as dozens have sought help there. One church member came from Westchester County with piles of blankets and sweat shirts, one brought apples from upstate, another, a tray of three dozen deviled eggs, Ms. Schaper said.
Several religious leaders plan to hold a candlelight vigil Wednesday at 5:30 p.m. on the steps of the Judson church, hoping to enlist other religious institutions to help. 
Some are already acting. Middle Collegiate Church in Astor Place gave a pizza dinner and breakfast to 15 protesters who stayed at the church Tuesday night, and its board is considering how it can stay involved.
The Rev. Jacqui Lewis of Middle Collegiate said that providing food was one natural route for the church, which had helped train protesters at Zuccotti Park in how to run their kitchen. Like other religious leaders, she expressed solidarity with the demonstrators' non-violent methods and aim of economic justice.
"We must continue the spirit of this movement, which is essentially, for us, about everybody having enough," she said.
Occupy Faith is using Facebook in an effort to increase its support. This is the pledge the religious leaders have signed:
Our spiritual traditions are clear: the impoverishment of the many for the benefit of the few destroys us all. The cries of our people are clear: the American dream is compromised; the moveable middle is slipping away; and in our politics, all fairness is lost. The Soul of this Great Nation is in danger, threatened by the false idols.
So together we affirm the golden rule: treat our neighbors as ourselves. We commit ourselves to the restoration of justice in our economy, and compassion in our politics; that together we might behold a revolution of values for all our people. We ask all Americans to join us in this prayer, that once again our country might be a hope, and a dream, and a promise for all who reach its shores.

HEADLINE: Cadillac XTS: A Flagship Equipped With a Search Engine

BYLINE: TORI TELLEM


HIGHLIGHT: The XTS is the first Cadillac to offer Cue, the luxury brand's Apple-like telematics system. 

 BODY:
Introduced on Wednesday, Nov. 16: 2013 Cadillac XTS.
What is it? Click "clear history" -- the DTS and STS are not only merely dead, but really most sincerely dead. The XTS is the chosen one and is tipped to be the ultimate Cadillac for luxury and cutting-edge technology. 
What they said: "Engages senses." "Art and science converge." "Authentic materials." "Space is the ultimate luxury." "If luxury can see, it should also be seen." Also, the slightly discomfiting, "Laurence Fishburne makes me feel peaceful." 
What they didn't say: V-8. Cadillac says that for a vehicle of this size, and for what was done in the performance department (the peppy V-6, Brembo brakes and Magnetic Ride Control suspension, for example), a V-8 wasn't necessary. Couple that with fuel-efficiency demands, and it is off the table.
What makes it tick? It has a 3.6-liter direct-injection V-6 producing 300 horsepower. It is matched to a 6-speed automatic transmission. Fuel economy estimates from G.M. are 17 m.p.g. city, 28 highway and only slightly lower when fitted with the optional Haldex all-wheel-drive system.
How much, how soon? The XTS arrives in spring 2012. Pricing is likely to enter Audi A6 territory, so expect the $40,000 to mid-$50,000 range.
How's it look? Cadillac is fairly fixated on the interior, almost making the exterior an afterthought, and there isn't much to say beyond it looks like a Cadillac sedan. The centerpiece is the Customer User Experience interface, or Cue, which makes its debut in the XTS and is expected to expand to other models. The infotainment system has an 8-inch LCD touch screen and includes proximity sensing, which loads a driver's predetermined command icons when it senses the approach of a finger tip. The system also has haptic feedback, making the buttons pulse when pressed to let the driver know the request was received.

HEADLINE: Hyundai Azera Finds Niche Between Sonata and Genesis

BYLINE: TORI TELLEM


HIGHLIGHT: The sedan was reimagined as an entry-level luxury option within the brand, a role occupied until Wednesday by the Genesis. 

 BODY:
Introduced on Wednesday, Nov. 16: 2012 Hyundai Azera.
What is it? An all-new full-size sedan that fits between the Sonata and Genesis.
What they said: The Azera is the seventh vehicle in Hyundai's "24/7 version 2.0 product initiative," with seven new models in 24 months.
What they didn't say: No one explained exactly why a brand like Hyundai needs three luxury sedans: Azera, Genesis and Equus. Hyundai is also boasting about its success at selling more than 100,000 vehicles that get 40 m.p.g., so with the Azera being just another luxury sedan and just another less-than-40-m.p.g. vehicle, we're not sure we understand the business case.
What makes it tick? The 3.3-liter V-6 will make 293 horsepower and will be coupled to a 6-speed transmission. Hyundai estimates a fuel economy rating of 20 m.p.g. city, 29 highway. 
How much, how soon? Hyundai isn't talking pricing yet, other than to say it knows that it has a reputation as a value brand and intends to stay that way when the Azera goes on sale in February. But there will be high-end standard equipment, including a navigation system.
How's it look? Automakers continue to use this word to describe their new vehicle's appearance: fluid. Hyundai went with its now-common phrase, "fluidic sculpture," which we're starting to believe is like saying "exciting-adjacent."

HEADLINE: Hyundai Azera Finds Niche Between Sonata and Genesis

BYLINE: TORI TELLEM


HIGHLIGHT: The sedan was reimagined as an entry-level luxury option within the brand, a role occupied until Wednesday by the Genesis. 

 BODY:
Introduced on Wednesday, Nov. 16: 2012 Hyundai Azera.
What is it? An all-new full-size sedan that fits between the Sonata and Genesis.
What they said: The Azera is the seventh vehicle in Hyundai's "24/7 version 2.0 product initiative," with seven new models in 24 months.
What they didn't say: No one explained exactly why a brand like Hyundai needs three luxury sedans: Azera, Genesis and Equus. Hyundai is also boasting about its success at selling more than 100,000 vehicles that get 40 m.p.g., so with the Azera being just another luxury sedan and just another less-than-40-m.p.g. vehicle, we're not sure we understand the business case.
What makes it tick? The 3.3-liter V-6 will make 293 horsepower and will be coupled to a six-speed transmission. Hyundai estimates a fuel economy rating of 20 m.p.g. city, 29 highway. 
How much, how soon? Hyundai isn't talking pricing yet, other than to say it knows that it has a reputation as a value brand and intends to stay that way when the Azera goes on sale in February. But there will be high-end standard equipment, including a navigation system.
How's it look? Automakers continue to use this word to describe their new vehicle's appearance: fluid. Hyundai went with its now-common phrase, "fluidic sculpture," which we're starting to believe is like saying "exciting-adjacent."

HEADLINE: Infiniti JX35 Moves the People - Seven of Them

BYLINE: TORI TELLEM


HIGHLIGHT: The luxury crossover is available with front- or all-wheel drive and comes standard with a raft of safety technology. 

 BODY:
Introduced on Wednesday, Nov. 16: 2013 Infiniti JX35.
What is it? A three-row, seven-passenger luxury crossover available in two models, the JX35 FWD and JX35 AWD. Question: Can anything still be defined as luxurious when stuffed with seven bodies?
What they said: "With a long wheelbase and short overhangs, as well as a low roofline that doesn't compromise interior headroom, the platform provides the benefits of a large family passenger vehicle without the usual exterior styling restrictions," noted the press materials.
What they didn't say: It is packed with so much accident-avoidance technology, including Backup Collision Intervention, Distance Control Assist, Around View Monitor with Moving Object Detection and Blind Spot Intervention, that it seems custom-designed to make even decent drivers doubt their skills.
What makes it tick? A 3.5-liter V-6 engine, producing 265 horsepower and 248 pound-feet of torque. Fuel economy is estimated at 17 m.p.g. in urban and 23 m.p.g. in highway driving. As for driving enjoyment in this nanny state on wheels, Infiniti added its Drive Mode Selector, which offers four modes: Standard, Sport, Eco and Snow. An optional system sharpens steering response and interfaces with the standard Vehicle Dynamic Control for a more confident cornering feel.
How much, how soon? The front-wheel-drive version will start at $41,345, the all-wheel-drive at $42,445; look for both next spring.
How's it look? Infiniti said that the JX has "standout styling," but just try to pick it out in a lineup of luxurious ute-bodied crossovers.

HEADLINE: After Giving Up Job for Occupy Protest, Questions for Future

BYLINE: BRENT MCDONALD and MATTHEW ORR


HIGHLIGHT: A week before the police evicted Occupy Wall Street protesters from Zuccotti Park, Tim Weldon quit his job in Connecticut to be closer to the movement. 

 BODY:
Last week, Tim Weldon, 35, quit his job in Connecticut and moved from home to devote his time to Occupy Wall Street. "I think this will end up being the biggest and best career move I ever made," he said in an interview.
That was before the police cleared protesters from their encampment at Zuccotti Park. Now, he said, "I have no place to go."
In this video, The New York Times follows Mr. Weldon in his involvement with Occupy Wall Street.
Mr. Weldon graduated from West Virginia University, has a master's degree in economic and social history from the University of Manchester in England, and has worked toward a Ph.D. in social anthropology at the University of Budapest. He is a founder and organizer of the group known as the Occupy Wall Street Think Tank, which has gathered to discuss topics like health care reform; the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, which introduced banking reforms; and the goals of the Occupy movement.
Before he joined Occupy Wall Street, Mr. Weldon had become frustrated with his employment situation and felt burdened by student debt. For two years, he said, while working odd jobs, he sent out hundreds of applications for full-time work, with no success. Finally, seven months ago, he was hired to help people with disabilities find jobs. The work was rewarding, he said, but he did not see much of a future in it. During the time he held the job, he lived with his grandparents, near Poughkeepsie, N.Y., to save on rent. He also picked up weekend work selling ice cream and refereeing women's lacrosse.
On Nov. 8, we followed Mr. Weldon during his last day at his job, after which he stopped to visit his grandparents. They struggled to understand his decision to quit and join the protests. His grandmother was especially worried about his safety because she had been watching news reports of tear-gassing at the Occupy protest in Oakland, Calif. This week, he has faced new challenges as the police have cleared Zuccotti Park.

HEADLINE: Breakfast Meeting, Nov. 16

BYLINE: NOAM COHEN


HIGHLIGHT: Reporters are arrested in Zuccotti Park, CBS presents its new "Early Show" lineup and Google is expected to announce its own online music-download store. 

 BODY:
The day after the nighttime raid that cleared protesters from Zuccotti Park, the New York Police Department was criticized by local politicians and news organizations for its treatment of reporters and the restrictions it placed on how they do their work. The Associated Press reported that at least half a dozen reporters were arrested in and around the park, home of the Occupy Wall Street movement, including a reporter and photographer from the agency. Michael Oreskes, senior managing editor for The A.P., said: "Journalists should not be restricted from access to news events or detained for attempting to do their jobs. We were unhappy that two of our staff members were swept up in the police operation, but we appreciate the N.Y.P.D.'s decision to release them."

        
A Daily News reporter was also arrested, the paper reported, though its long account of the police action against Zuccotti Park included no comment from Daily News management. An editorial published Tuesday morning, before its reporter was arrested, was titled, rather lengthily, "Bravo to Bloomberg's Occupy Wall Street eviction from Zuccotti Park finally reclaiming public space from unsanitary shantytown."

        
In a statement from Indianapolis, the Society for Professional Journalists condemned the arrests. "We know that as protests escalate it may be difficult for police to distinguish bystanders from participants, but it is clear now that many journalists have been erroneously arrested without cause," the society's president, John Ensslin, said. "These errors must be rectified immediately."

        
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg defended the way reporters were treated. "The Police Department routinely keeps members of the press off to the side when they're in the middle of a police action," he said. "It's to prevent the situation from getting worse and it's to protect the members of the press." [The Associated Press, The Daily News, S.P.J]
Perhaps the press management had its effect. Certainly, there was little video taken by journalists to show on the evening news programs, and, as Rick Klein of ABC News noted via Twitter, "Sandusky speaking out #PennSt leads all three broadcast newscasts tonight." [Twitter]
That interview Monday night with Jerry Sandusky - the former Penn State defensive coordinator who has been charged with 40 counts of sexually abusing young boys - gave "Rock Center With Brian Williams" its highest ratings in its brief existence, ArtsBeat blog reported, with 4.5 million total viewers. Still, those ratings paled in comparison to those of "20/20," which devoted the same 10 p.m. hour to an intimate look at the recovery of Representative Gabrielle Giffords after she was critically wounded in a shooting in Tucson last January; its total audience was 13.4 million viewers. [ArtsBeat]

        
Alessandra Stanley commented on the Sandusky interview, which ran in a longer form on the "Today" show. It "was one of the more disturbing and damaging attempts at spin control in recent memory," she wrote. "And this is an election year." [NYT]
The potential cancellation of the N.B.A. season has the league discussing how it might compensate the owners of its broadcast outlets, ESPN and Turner Sports, Amy Chozick reports. Those outlets are scrambling to fill the gaps in their prime-time lineup. [NYT]
CBS News presented the new faces - the PBS interviewer Charlie Rose and the talk show host Gayle King - of its break-the-mold "Early Show" that debuts Jan. 9. "There will be no cooking segments and no couch on the set," writes Brian Stelter, who quote the CBS News chairman, Jeff Fager, as jokingly asking, "Where will the weatherman sit? Oh wait. ..." In fact, the show will have no weatherman. [NYT]
C-Span's chief executive, Brian P. Lamb, wrote to the Supreme Court asking to be allowed to televise oral arguments there over the constitutionality of the recently passed health care law. In a letter available on the network's Web site, Mr. Lamb argued that the case deserved wider attention because the it "will affect every American's life, our economy and certainly will be an issue in the upcoming presidential campaign. [C-Span]
Google is expected to announce on Wednesday that it is opening an online music-download store, The Wall Street Journal reported, and three of the world's four biggest music companies - Sony Music, Universal Music Group and EMI - "are expected to have deals in place to let Google sell their music in time" for the announcement. Independent music labels also will participate, according to the Journal report. Billboard.biz wrote that because Google may be missing the participation of one of the labels, Warner Music Group, Wednesday's event "could lack the firepower that might otherwise be seen at a major product launch by a technology giant."
Julie Bosman profiles the author Ann Patchett, the best-selling novelist who on Wednesday is opening a bookstore in her hometown of Nashville, called Parnassus Books. She is taking on the burden, she said, because she has "no interest in living in a city without a bookstore." And there is reason for Ms. Patchett to have cautious optimism:
She is aspiring to join a small band of bookstore owners who have found patches of old-fashioned success in recent years, competing where Amazon cannot: by being small and sleek, with personal service, intimate author events and a carefully chosen rotation of books. [NYT]

        
Walt Mossberg of AllThingsD reviewed the Kindle Fire, and settled upon what has become the consensus about the e-reader tablet: that it's a real nice device ... for the price. "I think it's a good - though not a great -product and a very good value," he writes. "It doesn't just add color to the Kindle, it adds a robust ability to store and stream music, TV shows and movies - and a weaker ability to store and display color photos. And it offers about 8,500 apps at launch, including Netflix, Angry Birds and QuickOffice." [AllThingsD]

HEADLINE: Visa to Offer Mobile Payments in Developing Nations

BYLINE: JENNA WORTHAM


HIGHLIGHT: Visa announced plans for a product aimed at letting cellphone users in less developed nations buy goods and pay bills using their phones. The service will be available through a simple application or text messaging, 

 BODY:
 Visa has been hard at work on a mobile digital wallet that it hopes to roll out early next year. But that's not the only mobile market the credit card company has its eye on.
On Wednesday, the company announced plans for a product aimed at letting cellphone users in less developed nations buy goods and pay bills using their phones.
"It won't require a physical card attached to the account," said John Partridge, president of Visa. "It's a virtual prepaid account designed specifically for the mobile market in the developing world."
The service will be available through a simple application or text messaging, and it will work across mobile operators. Users will be able to add more money to their virtual Visa accounts at special kiosks.
"It's almost like a branchless banking approach," Mr. Partridge said. He said the service would be fed in part by the company's acquisition of Fundamo, a financial services company that specializes in international markets, as well as a partnership with the MTN Group, a telecommunications provider in Africa and the Middle East.
The new service will begin in Nigeria and Uganda and move across the rest of Africa, as well as Asia and Latin America.
Mr. Partridge said the new service was part of Visa's larger strategy of expanding its payment network. The service will charge users a small fee for each transaction.
"We're looking to grow our revenue outside of the United States to balance the revenue growth between the U.S. and the rest of the world," he said. "And we think this is a combination of a terrific opportunity to take payment services to the underbanked and bring more people securely into the economic mainstream."

HEADLINE: Grover and the Giant No-Taxes Pledge

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: If the supercommittee declares a stalemate, blame Grover Norquist. 

 BODY:
Polls will tell you that a majority of Americans recognize the need to raise taxes. A group of about two-dozen American millionaires have signed a letter to Congress asking for tax hikes that would affect them directly. They even sent a delegation to Washington today to make that case.
So why is the Congressional "supercommittee" stalled in its mission to cut the deficit and seemingly heading for a deadlock? His name is Grover Norquist, a hard-line conservative who has never been elected to office but wields enormous power.
Seventy-one members of the House - that's one in six - have signed a letter to the committee demanding that the deficit be cut without any tax increases. In fact, they want any tax increases to be offset by tax cuts. (I know, it makes no sense.)
The letter was organized by the Republican Study Committee - the House's most conservative members - in response to a proposal by Republicans on the supercommittee to increase revenues by $300 billion as part of a plan to cut the deficit by $1.5 trillion.
As our editorial this morning describes, the Republican plan is designed to give the illusion of a concession while actually permanently reducing income tax rates even below the low level of the Bush tax cuts. David Firestone, who covers Congress for the editorial board, said:
But even that is too much for the House members who signed the letter. Increasing tax rates, they said, is "irresponsible and dangerous to the health of the United States." Many members of the group have made clear their preference for slashing or even ending social-insurance programs like Medicare and Medicaid rather than raising taxes on the rich.
They were encouraged by Mr. Norquist, the self-appointed administrator of the no-taxes pledge. He posted the RSC letter on the website of his lobbying group, Americans for Tax Reform, and encouraged his supporters to write their members of Congress to add their signatures to the list.
He has repeatedly told Republicans they will risk his wrath if they agree to any new tax revenue to lower the deficit, and that threat, according to several members of Congress, has been one of the main forces preventing any real progress on the panel.
This is the kind of intransigence that has held up every reasonable compromise all year to combine spending cuts with revenue increases. Now even a Republican proposal that isn't even a real compromise is being shot down for containing a tincture of new money.
Mr. Norquist founded his group, which opposed increasing the share of GDP taken up by federal spending, at the request of his hero, Ronald Reagan, one of the great deficit spenders. He was on the Republican Platform Committees in 1998, 1992 and 1996, helping his party lurch to the right. He helped draft the Contract with America, which helped the Republicans take over the House. He helped secure early support for George W. Bush's presidential bid, and campaigned in 2000 and 2004 to help him win the White House, where he too went on a deficit-driven spending binge.
If the supercommittee declares a stalemate in the next few days, leading to automatic across-the-board spending cuts, Mr. Norquist can claim some credit for that, too.

HEADLINE: A 'Radical Centrist' View on Election Forecasting

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: The question is not whether or not campaign strategy affects a race's outcome, but how much it does, which is hard to predict. Also, there's a difference between fitting data to past results and actually making a prediction. 

 BODY:
Ron Klain, the former chief of staff to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., has a long critique up at Bloomberg about the piece that I published in The New York Times Magazine recently about President Obama's re-election prospects. His article takes the view that campaign strategy and other intangibles are quite important in presidential campaigns and that statistical forecasts do a poor job of accounting for these.
Unfortunately, Mr. Klain's article attributes to me a number of views that I am ambivalent about or actively disagree with, so it deserves a fairly long reply. I will also use this opportunity to respond to some criticisms that I have been receiving from political scientists. The irony is that I agree with Mr. Klain more than he realizes.
But let's start with Mr. Klain's central question: how much difference does campaign strategy make in determining the outcome of presidential elections?
Do all the ads, speeches, mailings, debates, online activity and rallies really change minds? Or is the outcome of the election the product of underlying fundamentals that are scarcely affected by such efforts?
This is obviously something of a false juxtaposition. It is extremely unlikely that campaigns don't matter at all. Now and then, you'll see a political scientist come fairly close to expressing this viewpoint, but that is certainly not the majority opinion within the discipline. The question, instead, is campaigns matter, and that is a difficult question to answer.
I strongly agree with Mr. Klain that political scientists as a group badly overestimate how accurately they can forecast elections from economic variables alone. I have written up lengthy critiques of several of these models in the past, which suffer from fundamental problems regardless of which variables they choose.
One of the things it took me a long time to learn about forecasting is that there's a difference between fitting data to past results and actually making a prediction. A regression model built from historical data is really just a of statistical relationships that existed in the past. The forecaster or that the relationships will also apply in the future, but there is often a significant deterioration in performance.

I'm not just talking about obvious examples of spurious correlation like that the winner of the Super Bowl was once a highly "statistically significant" predictor of the direction of the stock market. (In recent years, this indicator has performed badly.) The problems run a lot deeper than that, affecting many or perhaps even most of the statistical relationships documented in the peer-reviewed literature in some fields. 
John P.A. Ioannidis, for instance, has described how published research findings in medical journals cannot be replicated independently. Scott Armstrong of the Wharton Business School, who has devoted most of his life to studying prediction, has found analagous problems in the social sciences. My research into the Survey of Professional Forecasts suggests that actual economic data falls outside the 90 percent confidence intervals as claimed by economists somewhere between one-third or one-half of the time, meaning that they are extremely overconfident about the reliability of their forecasts.
Presidential forecasting models that rely on economic data are likely to be especially susceptible to these problems. Most of them are fit to data from a small sample of 10 to 20 past elections but have a choice of literally hundreds of defensible economic or political variables to sort through. Forecasters who are not conscientious about their methodology will wind up with models that make overconfident forecasts and that impute meaning to statistical noise.
I would not paint all the forecasters with the same brush. Two political scientists who I know have a very sophisticated understanding of these problems are Larry Bartels at Princeton and Robert Erikson at Columbia. Others, like Hans Noel, will publish models, but provide very explicit disclaimers about their limitations. But there others who tweak as many knobs as they can, and there are bloggers and reporters who take all of the results at face value and don't distinguish the responsible forecasts from the junk science. The problem is made worse when a game show is made out of forecasting and everyone competes to see who can get the most overfit model published in a peer-reviewed journal.
A more tangible question is how well economic statistics alone can really predict elections. I have written previously that a good assumption is that they can explain perhaps 50 percent of the results. But based on some further research that I will soon publish, I suspect that estimate was too high, and that the answer is more like 30 or 40 percent when the models are applied to make real, out-of-sample forecasts. Economic variables that perform better than that over a small subset of elections tend to revert to the mean or even perform quite poorly over larger samples.
So say that 60 percent of elections be explained by economic variables. Should all of the remaining credit go to campaigns?
No, of course not. First, the fact that cannot explain more than about 40 percent of election results does not mean that cannot. The American economy is very hard thing to measure. Gross domestic product was originally estimated to have declined at a rate of about 3.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008; revised data puts the decline at almost 9 percent instead. The government first reported that the economy had grown by 4.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 1977, but that figure was later revised to 0.1 percent. Using revised data can reduce the error to some extent, but there is quite a lot of intrinsic uncertainty of measurement. Some of the debates about why variable X is superior to variables P, D and Q are no more productive than debating the number of angels that can dance on a pinhead; the measurement error swamps any marginal gain that might be made from the choice of one reasonable variable over another.
Moreover, there are differences between what the statistics say about the economy and how Americans actually experience it. Some of these differences can be exploited by campaigns, but others fall into the category of being "unknown knowns": things that are manifestly important but that we don't have a good way to measure. Beyond the economy, likewise, there are other sorts of factors that campaigns may have little control over. Wars. Terrorist attacks. Earthquakes. Hurricanes. Sex scandals. Most of the attempts to translate these events into statistical variables have been quite silly. But that doesn't mean the uncertainty they introduce into forecasting should be mistaken for the skill of a campaign. It's not to Michael Dukakis's credit that Gary Hart was dumb enough to get caught on a yacht with a swimsuit model.
Next, we have to make a distinction between and . Sometimes a very appealing candidate runs a terrible campaign -- Hillary Rodham Clinton comes to mind -- or vice versa. Variables related to the candidates themselves are potentially easier to quantify than those related to campaign strategy. 
One of those variables is the left-right ideology of the candidate, which I do include in my model and which political scientists have sometimes included in the past. Measuring ideology is not easy -- although in practice it is probably no harder than accurately measuring the economy -- but there are a few well-regarded methods for doing so. I have evaluated a couple, and they perform quite well according to statistical tests, even when taken in conjunction with factors like the president's approval rating on Election Day or robust measures of economic performance. 
To be sure, statistical tests may miscalibrate the impact of ideology just as they exaggerate the impact of particular economic variables. But there are strong theoretical reasons to believe that ideology matters, and there is moderately strong evidence from other contexts, like Congressional elections and elections in parliamentary systems, that it does. It does not seem plausible, meanwhile, as some political scientists' models imply, that the difference between Representative Michele Bachmann or Mitt Romney would amount to only 1 or 2 points at the polls.
Another difficulty is that candidate ideology is correlated with other variables, like the length of the time that a party has been out of office, and those variables in turn have been correlated with election results. My view is that there are strong reasons to believe that ideology is in fact the causal factor -- models that make the opposite assumption come up with some highly implausible results -- but it is hard to know for sure when you're dealing with highly correlated variables over small samples. We will be publishing more about this topic in the coming weeks.
Nevertheless, Michele Bachmann's campaign would have to work with Mrs. Bachmann, while Mitt Romney's would have to work with him; how much difference can their strategies make at the margin? 
One of the more tangible examples of campaign strategy mattering was in 2008, where by a variety of measures Mr. Obama's campaign (which Mr. Klain was a part of) overperformed by a net of about 3 or 4 points in swing states. In this case, Mr. Obama's sound strategy was superfluous since he was likely to have won the campaign either way, but had the election been closer, it may have made a difference. Our models in 2008 generally found that Mr. Obama was about 5 percent more likely to win the Electoral College but lose the popular vote rather than the other way around.
My -- and it's just a guess -- is that this may be as good an estimate as any at the effects that a well-run campaign might have. Perhaps a very well run campaign can improve a president's chances of winning re-election by 5 or 10 percent. But who knows. We have already had an extremely wide array of outcomes in the various special and interim elections that have taken place around the country so far this year, and we've had a very wild Republican primary, suggesting that voter preferences may be more malleable than normal.
In fact, I discussed some of these effects in my article. I wrote, for instance, about a scenario in which the economic numbers might be relatively good, but Mr. Obama nevertheless would lose to Mr. Romney: 
Romney is much different stylistically from Bush's opponent, Bill Clinton, but both are skilled at driving an economic message. Romney would bring out his PowerPoint and seek to persuade voters that the growth had been too little and too late. After all, if killing bin Laden couldn't lift Obama's approval rating much above 50 percent, who knows whether one year of good-but-not-great growth would?
My article was full of these sorts of devil's-advocate cases -- reminders that it's hard to forecast an election a year in advance, and that even when you get closer to it, things might not go according to the formula. Among other years, 1948, 1952, 1960, 1968, 1976, 1992 and 2000 were problematic for at least some of the model-based forecasts. More recently, a lot of "fundamentals" models badly underestimated Republican gains in the 2010 midterm elections.
These models are not that good, so my view is that if you're going to build one, it ought to have a nice wide confidence interval that is designed to apply in the real world and not just in the software package. I also hold the view that one should switch to polling-based metrics sooner rather than later. These models are easier to calibrate, are less prone to overfitting (they have essentially just one variable: the polling average) and are far less presumptuous about why the electorate votes the way it does. They make the very reasonable assumption that voters will do a better job of explaining why they vote the way they do than can be inferred from a series of quasi-random economic inputs. 
If polling-based models do a much better job of prediction, they sacrifice something in elections, leaving some of Mr. Klain's questions unresolved. At the same time, it is important to be aware of the elections in which no campaign would have changed the result. One of these is an example that Mr. Klain cites: 1984.
But, to use just one example, if cold, hard economic data were decisive in elections, then President Ronald Reagan, seeking re-election in 1984 when the economy was beset by a 7.5 percent unemployment rate, wouldn't have won 49 states. After all, his successor, President George H.W. Bush lost by more than 200 electoral votes when he ran for re-election in 1992, with the jobless rate at 7.4 percent.
The unemployment rate may have been 7.5 percent when voters went to the polls to pick between Ronald Reagan and Walter Mondale. But it had declined from as high as 10.8 percent earlier in Mr. Reagan's term. Moreover, economic growth was exceptional in both 1983 and 1984, with G.D.P. advancing at almost 6 percent in the election year. 
One thing the statistical evidence is quite clear upon is that voters are reasonably forward-looking and weigh the rate of change much more heavily than how the economy is performing in an absolute sense. (Historically, the raw unemployment rate has been among the very worst predictors of election outcomes, while the change in job growth during the election year has been among the very best.) Mr. Reagan's morning in America campaign seemed brilliant when the unemployment rate had fallen to 7 percent from 11 percent. The same message would have been ridiculous had the unemployment rate to 7 percent from 3 percent instead.
I apologize if some of this seems prickly. I lived through the wars in baseball and then saw how much progress the sport made once everyone learned how much they had in common. 
Baseball games, however, are played 162 times per year, so the learning process is accelerated. But presidential elections are held only once every 4 years, and we make the same mistakes over and over again. The outcome of the election isn't especially predictable right now, but here are four predictions you can take to the bank:
1. Next year, the strategists of the winning campaigns will be praised as brilliant.
2. Next year, the strategists of the losing campaign will be blamed for a long series of mistakes.
3. Next year, some of the political science models will hit the outcome right on the nose.
4. Next year, some of the political science models will miss wildly in one direction or another.
Maybe one of the campaigns really will have made the difference; the forecasting models can tell us something about that, by the way. But it's just as likely that a campaign that deserves praise for keeping the election to within 2 points when its candidate "should" have lost by 6 will get blame when it deserves credit. Meanwhile, I'll be rooting for the models that apply more responsible forecasting practices, but most of how they perform over the next few elections will be determined by luck. Better if we acknowledge their limitations in advance.

 BODY:
The Wisest Entrepreneurs Know How to Preserve Equity | So you want to be an Internet billionaire. It's not just about having a great idea and building a world-class business at light speed, writes Steven M. Davidoff in his Deal Professor column.
A review of recent filings for initial public offerings by Internet start-ups shows that the founders of Groupon and Zynga -- and by other indications, Facebook, which has yet to file -- have had to do more. These entrepreneurs avoided selling their precious equity early, before reaching the I.P.O. milestone, making them appear more savvy than earlier Internet moguls. But their success may have come in large part thanks to an old guard in Silicon Valley that is eagerly advising the new generation on how to avoid pitfalls. DealBook

HEADLINE: McCartney Letter Seeking Drummer for Beatles Sells for $55,000

BYLINE: RANDY KENNEDY


HIGHLIGHT: The letter, from 1960, invites and unnamed drummer to an audition. 

 BODY:
 If artistic reputations were judged by memorabilia auction prices alone the letter that sold at Christie's in London on Tuesday night would place Paul McCartney - at least in the current economy - decidedly below both his former bandmate John Lennon and John Keats but well ahead of the novelist Harper Lee.
 The handwritten letter, dated Aug. 12, 1960, in which Mr. McCartney invites an unnamed drummer to audition for a place in the Beatles, sold for almost 35,000, or about $55,000. In March a Keats love letter - the last known to be in private hands - went for 96,000, or $151,000, at a London auction. Earlier this month a 1960 letter from Ms. Lee, the author of "To Kill A Mockingbird," to a fan - informing the fan that the real location of the novel's Maycomb County was not in Alabama but in Ms. Harper's heart - sold for $9,500 in Los Angeles.
 But per word, Lennon's writing seems to be the best investment. A cardboard placard - saying "Bed Peace" in curvy block letters - that Lennon made in 1969 during his second weeklong bed-in with Yoko Ono to protest the Vietnam War sold for more than 97,000, or $153,000.

HEADLINE: The Economy Isn't Obama's Only Challenge

BYLINE: MATT BAI


HIGHLIGHT: This time around, the president has to run as a conventional Democrat, and in the modern political era, that isn't an easy thing to do. 

 BODY:
There's a lot of talk now about the many reasons that President Obama faces a perilous path to re-election - starting, of course, with the torpid economy and a dysfunctional political system. But I wouldn't overlook the underlying, more structural challenge in the electoral map that would be vexing Mr. Obama and his strategists even if the economic picture weren't quite so bleak. 
Simply put, Mr. Obama now has to run for president as a conventional Democratic nominee. And this, at least in the modern political era, isn't an especially easy thing to do.
Mr. Obama did not have to deal with this in 2008, when a bunch of mitigating factors came together to make him something more than his party's choice for the presidency. The war in Iraq, the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the market, the erupting fury at Washington's impotence, the way Mr. Obama himself seemed to embody generational change and a renewal of the American story - all of this made it possible for him to run, essentially, as an independent candidate who rarely talked in terms of party. 
Mr. Obama was able to run as a repudiation of the Bush years and a symbol of reform, and because of that he won in states - like Indiana and North Carolina and Virginia - where national Democrats have frequently been slapped around. 
Three years later, as was always bound to happen, Mr. Obama is grayer and less glamorous, another president trapped in a highly partisan moment and trying to flatten out a long arc of economic decline. Now, in the public mind, he is not simply a young president or the first black president, but a fairly typical Democratic president. And that comes with some daunting electoral math.
Consider that only four Democrats in history have managed to get 51 percent of the popular vote: Andrew Jackson, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Lyndon Johnson and Mr. Obama. Now, to be fair, this really isn't as damning for the party as it sounds. After all, the half-century or so after the Civil War was pretty much dominated by northern Republicans, for obvious reasons. 
And Roosevelt alone won convincing majorities in four elections, during a time that a Democratic coalition also came to solidly rule Congress. It's not like Democrats had trouble winning in those years.
In the 11 elections since Johnson punished Barry Goldwater in 1964, however, Democrats have had a legitimately hard time assembling majorities. Republicans won seven of those elections, four times decisively - in 1972, 1980, 1984 and 1988. Democrats won four times, but only Mr. Obama managed to break the 51 percent mark. (It's worth noting that in several of those elections, third-party candidacies made that goal even more elusive.)
You could gather up a lot of theories about why this is, but the most persuasive one I've heard - most recently from Byron Shafer, a serious-minded political scientist at the University of Wisconsin - is that elections in the post-Vietnam, post-civil rights era turned in large part on two issues: diverging views of how to handle the cold war and then terrorism, and divisive cultural issues. 
In both of these areas, Republicans enjoyed a natural advantage in the broad center of the electorate. Liberal America's lingering ambivalence toward the military, coupled with a perceived bias toward the poor at the expense of the middle class, branded Democrats as being outside the mainstream. 
Democrats fared better when the economy was the main concern, but even then, a Democratic nominee had to struggle mightily to overcome all the residual cultural stuff. Look at Bill Clinton, the best campaigner and least traditional Democratic of the age; he ran twice with the economic winds gusting at his back and yet topped out at 49.2 percent of the popular vote in 1996. 
The hopeful news here for Mr. Obama is that his party is probably less vulnerable today on foreign policy and social issues than at any time since the 1960s. It was Mr. Obama, after all, who sent the Navy Seals in to kill Osama bin Laden. And on contentious cultural questions like gay rights and stem cell research, a new generation of voters, reared in a more tolerant and technological society, is rapidly changing the political calculus.
The less encouraging news for the president, of course, is that he doesn't have economic conditions in his favor, as Mr. Clinton did. And while the president's liberal followers may rally around Mr. Obama's health care law and his newfound populism, independent voters seem inclined to think of Mr. Obama now as a traditional, pre-Clinton Democrat - the kind for whom no solid majority has materialized since 1964.
For the conventional Democratic nominee of the modern era, which now describes Mr. Obama, the most pressing question is never how to rally the sizable percentage of voters who are already inclined to vote for you, but rather how to somehow scrape your way to 51.

HEADLINE: Gingrich on Defensive Over Freddie Mac Fees

BYLINE: JIM RUTENBERG and JEFF ZELENY


HIGHLIGHT: Newt Gingrich received $1.6 million to $1.8 million from Freddie Mac for providing strategic advice, Bloomberg News reported. 

 BODY:
9:01 p.m. | UpdatedFor roughly six years, Newt Gingrich worked closely with high-level officials at the government-sponsored mortgage company Freddie Mac. As a highly paid consultant, he coached them on how to win over the conservatives who consider their company an anathema, spoke to their political action committee and offered general advice as they worked to stave off various threats to Freddie Mac's survival, several people familiar with his role there said Tuesday.
The full extent of Mr. Gingrich's involvement with Freddie Mac burst into the open after Bloomberg News reported Tuesday that he earned $1.6 million to $1.8 million, in an on-and-off relationship from 1999 to 2008, with the mortgage company that has since been taken over by the federal government. The payments were far more than had previously been known, or than Mr. Gingrich, the former House speaker, had previously acknowledged.
His compensation, which several former Freddie Mac officials confirmed in interviews on Tuesday, and the extent of his work with the mortgage company, presented Mr. Gingrich with a fresh challenge to his Republican bid for the presidency just as he was climbing in polls and gaining traction as a possible challenger to the party's presumed front-runner, Mitt Romney.
Not only is Freddie Mac a longtime conservative whipping post, but the extent of his consultancy for the mortgage giant seemed to be at odds with his own statements about his work there. He has also blamed it for the collapse of the housing market, saying that at least one Democratic supporter should be jailed, and, in 2008, that President Obama should give back any money his campaign received from its executives.
The news of the full extent of his Freddie Mac contract put him on the defensive all day. 
"Fannie and Freddie, as you know, have been the epicenter of the financial meltdown in this country," said Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, while campaigning in Iowa. "While he was taking that money, I was fighting against Fannie and Freddie."
Speaking with reporters in Iowa on Wednesday, Mr. Gingrich played down the report, saying that he did not know exactly how much he was paid, and that Freddie Mac was but one company that enlisted his firm, the Gingrich Group.
"It's a multiyear project. It was paid to Gingrich Group. Gingrich Group has many clients," Mr. Gingrich told reporters. "I offer strategic advice for a lot of different companies." (His campaign followed up by listing some of them, including I.B.M.,Microsoft and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.)
And, he said, "I did no lobbying of any kind."
In interviews on Tuesday, several former Freddie Mac officials, and others with direct knowledge about his work there did not dispute that. But at least four of them did dispute Mr. Gingrich's own description of his work for Freddie Mac during the CNBC debate last week. When asked about a $300,000-per-year, two-year contract in 2006 and 2007, Mr. Gingrich said he had acted as an "historian."
He said Freddie officials had come to ask his advice, as an historian, telling him, "We are now making loans to people who have no credit history and have no record of paying back anything, but that's what the government wants us to do."
And, he explained: "As I said to them at the time, this is a bubble. This is insane. This is impossible."
Five officials with knowledge of his interactions, and speaking on the condition of anonymity to avoid getting drawn into a public fight with him, said they had never heard of him saying any such thing.
"Freddie wasn't spending $25,000 to $35,000 a month for years to have somebody give them history lessons on what would have happened in 1945 if Japan had won," one former official said.
Another said Mr. Gingrich was enlisted at a time when conservatives were moving aggressively to dismantle Freddie and its counterpart,Fannie Mae, and the organizations were trying to fight back by presenting themselves "as American as apple pie."
Officials said Mr. Gingrich was brought in to help Freddie Mac hone its message to conservative audiences. One person recalled that Mr. Gingrich advised them, for instance, to tell Republicans that the organization was not explicitly government backed - and, at the time, it was not - but also not as freewheeling as Wall Street banks, occupying a responsible middle ground.
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were commonly referred to as government-sponsored entities. They were established by Congress, and their debt and other obligations have always carried an implicit guarantee that the federal government would step in to save them if they were ever in danger of collapse. Republicans said that the companies - and by implication their Democratic supporters - fueled the crisis by financing vast numbers of unaffordable loans.
In all, Mr. Gingrich served two terms as a consultant to Freddie Mac, the first starting shortly after he left the House in 1999. Hired by the head of the mortgage company's government affairs shop, Robert Mitchell Delk, he stayed on through 2002. In an interview with Bloomberg, Mr. Delk said Mr. Gingrich helped him prepare to meet with White House officials to discuss President George W. Bush's "ownership society."
Two other officials said that during his second run with the group, when he took a two-year contract starting in 2006, he addressed donors to the Fannie Mac political action committee and discussed writing an op-ed article or academic "white paper," but never wound up putting his name on anything on Freddie's behalf.
Mr. Gingrich has in recent months been harshly critical of those who have worked with Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. For instance, he said, Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, should be jailed for his association with "a lobbyist who was close to Freddie Mac."
On Tuesday, his campaign said that Mr. Gingrich "believes the financial crisis shows that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac should be broken up and their smaller successors be moved off of government guarantees and into the free market."
For his part, Mr. Gingrich said he welcomed the scrutiny. "Everybody will dig up everything they can dig up," Mr. Gingrich said. "That's fine; they should."

HEADLINE: Lightning Round

BYLINE: DAVID BROOKS and GAIL COLLINS


HIGHLIGHT: There are a lot of things to talk about this week: Cain, Gingrich, Occupy Wall Street - and Cincinnati. 

 BODY:
David Brooks: Gail, there have been a lot of news events of minor importance hitting us all at once so let's play lightning round. First, did you see the Herman Cain video clip on Libya, the one in which he is asked whether he supports Obama's policy there and he stumbles around desperately trying to remember which country Libya is (the little one north of Israel maybe?), what just happened there (Lawrence of Arabia?) and what Obama's policy might actually be.
His stumbles and pauses make Rick Perry look like Winston Churchill. Can you remember a presidential candidate less qualified for the office? I can't. I'm racking my brains, but my impression is that every single candidate in recent political history (including Pat Paulsen) was better informed.
Gail Collins: Well, if I was a restaurant association lobbyist turned motivational speaker who, in my mid-60s, was suddenly transformed into a presidential candidate, I'd probably have quite a few countries where I drew a blank. If Donald Trump had stayed in, he'd have done better:But I find it quite heartening that Cain offers evidence that a career in politics is actually good for something. Very hard to run for president without it. Unless you're a general who won a war.
David: Then there is the squabble over whether the Occupy movement should be allowed to camp out in lower Manhattan. I know this is regarded as an event rivaling the Russian Revolution in some quarters but I can't get worked up about where or if they camp out at all. I have looked around for some evidence that the Occupy movement has had an effect on public opinion, but I can't find any. When people are asked whether government or Wall Street is more responsible for the recession, they say government by overwhelming majorities. You would think that if the occupiers have moved public opinion at all, it would be on that subject.
Gail: Not sure I agree with you on this one. Polls also show a growing public concern with the gap between the very rich and the rest of the country and enthusiastic support for the idea of taxing the V.R. to help resolve the nation's debt problems. I think the whole Occupy Wall Street phenomenon has been, if not transformative, at least helpful on this front. Plus you are never going to get me to be dismissive of young Americans trying to form a protest movement. It may not directly lead to political reformation, but at a minimum we should be able to wring some good music out of it.
David: Then there is the rise of Newt Gingrich to the political stratosphere. My vanity is wounded when it comes to Newt because his press secretary is the rudest man in America, at least toward me.
Gail: O.K., I find that really hard to believe. You're the last person in the universe I can imagine the press secretary of a potential presidential candidate wanting to offend. Honest, I am making lists in my head and there are at least 300 major journalists ahead of you.
David: Still, I try to appreciate that at least Gingrich knows where Libya is and probably has a 14-point plan for redesigning its space program. Do you think voters don't care about the management issues that nearly wrecked his campaign a few months ago, or have they forgotten them? In other words, is any setback survivable so long as you can endure past the average attention span?
Gail: I think his campaign could survive both our memories of the campaign screw-ups of a few months back and our really painfully detailed knowledge of his history of serial adulteries, the three wives, the affair with the aide, etc., etc. But then there's the fact that he appears to be a really irritating, self-involved, pompous jerk. Voters aren't crazy about that. Not to put too fine a point on it.
David: Finally, I want to ask you about your beloved native region, the Midwest. Last week I wrote a column about status inequality, about why it is O.K. to brag about your inherited intelligence but not your inherited wealth.
In the Midwest, I believe, it used to be not O.K. to brag about anything. My impression is that the region was more genuinely egalitarian than the other regions, at least in the small and mid-sized cities. You didn't want to drive around in a fancy car. You didn't want to put on airs. I once heard a consultant give a talk on why C.E.O.s should pay their superstars much more than their average employees. Then he added, as an aside, "We're having some trouble persuading our Midwestern clients to do this." I thought I heard an entire ethos cracking.
Do you think I'm right that the Midwest was more socially egalitarian? Is it still? Has Midwestern culture become more like the coasts?
Gail: David, I come from the wrong side of the tracks in Cincinnati. I went back a few years ago to talk to my old girls' high school and met some terrific kids, who were totally confident about making their way in the world as not-wealthy young women, but really worried that it wasn't possible to get anywhere serious if you were from the west side of town. So, not necessarily.
In America we bounce between romanticizing the place we're from, and romanticizing the place where we've never lived. I have always had this mystical belief that people in Oregon had the answers, mainly because it is the only state I've never been to. Except for North Dakota, Nebraska and Hawaii. They might have the answers, too, but out of the four, I'm betting Oregon. If you had grown up in the Midwest, by now you'd have written an entire book about us, given us a telling nickname that we'd feel very suave about -something like Muppies, but way cooler. And you'd be able to explain Midwesterners to themselves. But in lieu of that, I would say no, we're not better. Just calmer.

HEADLINE: Decision 2013

BYLINE: DREW WESTEN


HIGHLIGHT: Putting off political decisions seems to come easily to President Obama. Is that why we're still trying to figure out who he is? 

 BODY:
For some time the Obama administration had appeared to be signaling its likely approval of a plan to lay a high-pressure oil pipeline from Canadian tar sands right on top of the main water supply to much of the Midwest. Last week, however, after thousands of protesters - ranging from ranchers and farmers to ordinary Americans concerned about the catastrophic harm that could be done if that pipeline were to leak - surrounded the White House, the administration announced that it was delaying a decision until 2013.
For a Democratic president who campaigned on turning America into a powerhouse of clean energy and stemming the tide of climate change (which so many Americans saw this year with their own eyes, as unprecedented floods, tornadoes, wildfires, and extreme weather swept virtually every region of the country), this should not have been a difficult decision. Although some progressive and conservative groups alike assume that this is the beginning of the end for the pipeline, what no one knows is what deals the administration may have struck with the oil industry, just as no one knew for a year, as pundits endlessly debated the popular "public option" in health care reform, that the president had cut a deal with health care industry executives to block it the year before.
Expanding production of one of the dirtiest, most difficult to extract (and hence least energy-efficient) fuels on earth is something one might have expected from the former oilman George W. Bush, not from his successor. The oil industry is trying to change the name of tar sands to "oil sands," and for good reason: "tar sands" polls badly, because the term leads people to picture something dirty, thick and toxic. And it turns out their gut-level reaction is accurate: Strip-mining of tar sands creates craters as wide as the Grand Canyon filled with toxic wastes. In one incident, 1,600 birds died after landing in a waste pond full of toxic chemicals from tar sands.
The decision to put off a political decision has turned out to be a defining characteristic of this administration. Typically the magic number is 2013, although 2014 and 2020 are popular second-choices. Just two months ago, under heavy lobbying from polluters, the president took both supporters and members of his own administration aback with a decision to override a plan produced by his own Environmental Protection Agency to tighten the lax Bush standards on clean air to prevent toxic smog. The president who had campaigned on restoring the role of science in decision-making overrode the judgment of a unanimous panel of scientists, suggesting that he wanted to "study" the issue further - perhaps until 2013.
Obama's 2013 Doctrine doesn't just apply to energy. When he made his "grand bargain" over the summer that cut over a trillion dollars from the budget - in 2013 - he created the Congressional committee charged with cutting at least another $1.2 trillion - to take effect in, you guessed it, 2013.
The question is why a president who likes to talk about being the "adult in the room" with Congressional Democrats and Republicans so frequently employs delaying tactics that look remarkably like the ones employed by my 7-year-old at bedtime. She's happy to go to bed - just after another glass of water, another chocolate milk (okay, I'm a lousy parent, but she really likes it), or another light turned on or off.
One possibility is that the administration believes this is good politics. By delaying the oil pipeline decision, the president left some supporters with the impression that he would cancel the project after the election or let it die a slow death, while simultaneously preventing Republicans from readily attacking him for opposing domestic (or at least Canadian) oil production, not to mention jobs.
The problem with that explanation is that it's actually very bad politics. After his grand bargain on the debt, for example, the president's approval ratings plummeted. The intended message was "I'm willing to compromise," but most voters just saw weakness. Matters were even worse the summer before with the president's signature issue, health care reform. The law might well have catapulted Democrats to victory rather than a "shellacking" in the 2010 midterm elections if its most popular provisions - especially the elimination of "pre-existing conditions" and providing coverage for tens of millions of working people who can't afford insurance - had taken effect in September of 2010, instead of in 2013 and 2014. 
Instead of letting Americans see the impact of the law on their own lives at a time when they desperately needed a shot in the arm, the White House and the Democrats allowed most of the benefits of the law (other than those that applied to children, including grown children living in the basement because they couldn't find work) to remain hypothetical while increases in insurance premiums and the continued elimination of employer-based insurance were anything but hypothetical to the average family, which was already struggling to make ends meet.
A second possibility is that the president either doesn't know or doesn't want anyone else to know what he believes. During the 2008 election, I remember listening incredulously to focus groups as swing voters would repeatedly say about a man they had watched for two years, "I don't know who he is." Now I understand what they meant. No modern American president has ever managed to make it through nearly three years in the White House with so few people really having any idea what he believes on so many key issues - let alone what his vision for the country is.
Does he believe that the way to stimulate an anemic economy is to stimulate demand or to contract it with budget cuts? (He's taken both positions within the last six months.) Does he believe that the rich and big corporations should pay more (as he has repeatedly said) or less (as he ended up negotiating for less than a year ago, when he had a lame duck Democratic Congress behind him)? Does he believe bankers should take personal responsibility for the damage they've done to millions of people's lives and livelihoods (as he has repeatedly said) or that they should be immune from investigation, let alone prosecution (the position his administration has taken as it has tried to twist the arms of state attorneys general who don't think that's right)?
Perhaps the most intriguing thing about an Obama-Romney election would be the question of who could hold out longer without the public discovering what they actually believe.
A third possibility is that the president is tied up in the knots of indecision because he lacks the passion that motivates decision-making and distrusts or fears precisely the emotions that allow us to choose between one course of action or another. Decades ago, psychoanalysts identified a particular personality style common among high-achieving men (although not limited to them), and in recent years researchers have been hot on its trail. People with this style (not narcissism, although that would be a good guess) prefer to see themselves as logical and rational, uninfluenced by emotion, and to think in abstract and intellectualized ways, as if emotions were irrelevant or inconsequential to decision making - when in fact they are essential to it. Whether that describes this president I cannot say, although he has been described by a close aide, and similarly by others, as "the most unsentimental man I've ever met." And it could certainly make sense of how a president of the United States could take two weeks away from Washington at precisely the moment he has empowered a "supercommittee" to make just the kinds of decisions about the fate of the nation that it's hard to imagine a president choosing to leave to somebody else.
Ultimately, the president's delay tactics may work for him, as he runs out the clock while Americans are still trying to figure out who he is. The Republicans are having so much trouble finding a candidate sane enough for the country to elect but crazy enough for their base that Obama may well be able to run unemployment up to 10 percent and still keep the one job that seems to matter the most to him. But the question is why he wants to.
Perhaps we'll find out in 2013.

HEADLINE: Gingrich's Freddie Mac Payday

BYLINE: THE EDITORS


HIGHLIGHT: Newt Gingrich's deal with the troubled mortgage lender shows just how easy it is for former public servants to enrich themselves. 

 BODY:
In a column in today's Campaign Stops, Timothy Egan writes: 
As a young graduate student pursuing an advanced degree in modern European history, Newt Gingrich wrote a dissertation titled "Belgian Education Policy in the Congo: 1945-1960." Thereafter, in the course of writing 23 books, the scholar-politician pontificated on many subjects, from the pope to a "pouting sex kitten," who appears for a quick romp in a novel about the Civil War.
None of his work had anything to do with the home lending practices that would help to destroy the American economy. So why would Freddie Mac pay $300,000 to Professor Gingrich in 2006 - just as the troubled mortgage lender was facing calls on Capitol Hill for increased regulation?
Turns out, that was just small change in the overall sweetheart deal that no historian but Gingrich could ever get. Bloomberg News reported this week that Gingrich made between $1.6 million and $1.8 million for giving additional "advice" to Freddie Mac.

HIGHLIGHT: The latest Newt Gingrich story encapsulates why Washington is broken and how the powerful protect and enrich themselves, unanchored to basic principles. 

 BODY:
As a young graduate student pursuing an advanced degree in modern European history, Newt Gingrich wrote a dissertation titled "Belgian Education Policy in the Congo: 1945-1960." Thereafter, in the course of writing 23 books, the scholar-politician pontificated on many subjects, from the pope to a "pouting sex kitten," who appears for a quick romp in a novel about the Civil War.
None of his work had anything to do with the home lending practices that would help to destroy the American economy. So why would Freddie Mac pay $300,000 to Professor Gingrich in 2006 - just as the troubled mortgage lender was facing calls on Capitol Hill for increased regulation?
Turns out, that was just small change in the overall sweetheart deal that no historian but Gingrich could ever get. Bloomberg News reported this week that Gingrich made between $1.6 million and $1.8 million for giving additional "advice" to Freddie Mac. When I asked about the amount, a Freddie Mac spokesman refused to comment, but officials at the agency who are familiar with the contracts confirmed the numbers reported by Bloomberg.
This is not just another Gingrich laugher, up there with his revolving Tiffany's account or his multiple personal hypocrisies. This story encapsulates why Washington is broken and how the powerful protect and enrich themselves, unanchored to basic principles.
At the same time, it's a case study in the Gingrich method: denounce something as outrageous, while doing that very outrageous thing himself. (Politicians with ties to Freddie Mac came in for scathing Gingrich criticism in 2010.) There is no evidence, as Gingrich claimed last week in a debate, that he offered Freddie Mac a dime's worth of advice in his capacity as a "historian," or warned against a surge in subprime lending. To the contrary, former Freddie Mac executives told Bloomberg that Gingrich was brought in to help the agency continue down the very path of its ruination - backing subprime mortgages.
Plain and simple, Gingrich was paid for his influence. A former speaker of the House, even a disgraced one, is still worth something. And so, what Gingrich actually did was praise Freddie Mac's business model, according to an Associated Press article in 2008. On top of that, he was asked by executives at Freddie to help frame the debate to win over fellow conservatives.
Freddie Mac and its sister firm in government-sanctioned lending assistance, Fannie Mae, were forced into government receivership in 2008. Since then, they have cost taxpayers $181 billion. These two agencies are often cited by Republicans as the main reason for the financial collapse.
With Gingrich, there ought to be a special category for gall. Here's what he said when asked in last week's debate about his $300,000 deal with Freddie:
My advice as a historian, when they walked in and said to me, "We are now making loans to people who have no credit history and have no record of paying back anything, but that's what the government wants us to do," as I said to them at the time, this is a bubble. This is insane. This is impossible.
If he can provide a single speech, audio transcript or paper backing this claim, I promise to personally sell copies of "Belgian Education Policy in the Congo," on street corners for a day.
And if he had come to such an enlightened and early conclusion about the pending housing collapse, why didn't Citizen Gingrich sound the alarm for his fellow countrymen? From this most gaseous of politicians, an op-ed, or quick sit-down with the sycophants at Fox News, would have helped warn a nation of its folly. But there is nothing. The narrative of Newt Gingrich as the Paul Revere of the housing crisis is a self-fantasy to cover up his complicity.
As to the Gingrich method, this latest episode is textbook. He's best known, of course, for blistering President Clinton for his dalliance with Monica Lewinsky at the same time that he, then speaker, was carrying on an affair with a House aide, now his third wife, Callista Gingrich.
In his latest incarnation, Gingrich poses as an outsider who will break up the Washington establishment - a scourge of the elites who feed off its culture of cronyism. But after 33 years in Washington, if Gingrich were any more embedded in the establishment, pigeons would be landing on his shoulder seeking the kind of relief normally accorded statues. Wednesday, while defending his work for Freddie, Gingrich said, "It reminds people that I know a great deal about Washington."
His tax-exempt entity, called American Solutions, allows him to make grand policy statements and promote his brand, while his private entity, Gingrich Productions, is a money-making machine. Most recently, Gingrich Productions has been cranking out DVDs in consort with Citizens United, the same group that prompted the infamous Supreme Court decision that corporations are people. And it was Gingrich Productions, he said on the campaign trail Wednesday, that took in all the money from the now-bankrupt lending agency.
The Freddie Mac deal shows just how easy it is for former public servants to enrich themselves. In this case, a well-connected politician gets paid an extravagant fee to "consult" with a runaway mortgage backer that is fighting off calls for increased scrutiny. He was hired, Bloomberg reported, to build bridges to fellow Republicans in Congress.
For added chutzpah, Gingrich recently suggested that Democratic politicians who were influenced by lobbyists at Freddie and Fannie ought to go to jail. But Gingrich draws a distinction for himself. "I did no lobbying of any kind," he said on Wednesday. No, that would be wrong.

HEADLINE: Arrest Made After Discovery That Shot Hit White House

BYLINE: By CHARLIE SAVAGE and MARK LANDLER; Emma G. Fitzsimmons contributed reporting from New York, and Brian Knowlton and Emmarie Huetteman from Washington.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Law enforcement officials on Wednesday arrested a 21-year-old Idaho man suspected of firing a semiautomatic rifle at the White House on Friday night, and the Secret Service reported finding that at least one bullet had struck the presidential residence.
The suspect, Oscar Ramiro Ortega-Hernandez, was arrested at a hotel near Indiana, Pa., about 12:35 p.m. by the Pennsylvania State Police, acting on information from Secret Service agents in Pittsburgh, the Secret Service said. 
''Ortega-Hernandez is currently in the custody of the Pennsylvania State Police,'' the statement said.
The man, previously referred to in a warrant as Oscar Ramiro Ortega, has a background of legal problems and is said to have a history of aberrant behavior. During an encounter earlier on Friday with the police in Arlington County, Va., he said he was from Idaho Falls. The police there said his family had reported him missing last month.
Gunfire was heard in the vicinity of the White House and the National Mall shortly after 9 on Friday night, and the Secret Service said its officers had seen a car speed away west on Constitution Avenue. A few minutes later, the car was found about seven blocks away, abandoned, with an assault-style semiautomatic rifle inside.
Investigators were examining evidence found in the car and talking with Mr. Ortega-Hernandez's relatives, who told them that he appeared to have a fixation on the White House or President Obama, one official said. Another official said the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives had traced the origin of the weapon, but the official declined to disclose the circumstances of its purchase.
The United States Park Police had obtained an arrest warrant charging Mr. Ortega-Hernandez with a felony count of carrying a deadly weapon. The agency had also released photographs showing that Mr. Ortega-Hernandez had distinctive tattoos, including the word ''Israel'' on the left side of his neck. He was also said to have three dots tattooed on his right hand, the name ''Ortega'' on his back, rosary beads and hands clasped in prayer on his right chest and folded hands on his left chest.
The police in Arlington County took those photographs on Friday when they stopped Mr. Ortega-Hernandez after someone reported that a man outside was circling the area in a suspicious manner. Mr. Ortega-Hernandez was on foot and unarmed, said Lieutenant Joe Kantor, a county police spokesman, and since ''there was no crime,'' there was no reason to arrest him.
Late on Friday, the police searched the Occupy DC protest camp, on McPherson Square just blocks from the White House, after reports that the suspect might have spent time there. Protesters there said on Wednesday that the police had been through their encampment several times since then, showing around a photograph of Mr. Ortega-Hernandez.
Sgt. David Schlosser of the Park Police said any motive would not be clear ''until we can talk to this guy.''
He said Mr. Ortega-Hernandez had criminal records in Idaho, Texas and Utah for charges including drugs, underage drinking, domestic violence, resisting arrest and assault on a police officer. Public records indicated much the same thing.
The Secret Service did not have Mr. Ortega-Hernandez on record as someone who had made any threats to the president, an agency official said.
Mr. Obama and his wife, Michelle, were away on Friday; the president was in San Diego on his way to an Asia-Pacific economic forum in Hawaii, and on Wednesday was in Australia.
It was not clear for several days that someone had deliberately fired at the White House. But the Secret Service has now found at least two bullets. The agency would not say where the White House had been struck, but workers on Wednesday were examining a window overlooking the Truman Balcony, an area outside the second-floor residential quarters where the first family sometimes relaxes or hosts guests.
A second round was found outside, and officials were searching the South Lawn for any other rounds. The area around the White House was generally more crowded than usual with police cars on Wednesday.
The shooting came from roughly 750 yards south of the White House, just outside the outer security perimeter. The security perimeter extends to the south edge of the Ellipse, a grassy area where the National Christmas Tree is displayed. It is across Constitution Avenue from the more distant Washington Monument.
The street area, usually open to the public, is one of the most guarded parts of the city -- or of the country, for that matter -- with the United States Park Police patrolling on the National Mall and the District of Columbia police on the streets. In addition, the Secret Service, with a uniformed force of 1,400 officers, has agents on guard at fixed positions on the White House grounds and on patrol nearby in cars and on bicycles. Streets are routinely shut down for motorcades. The Secret Service said its security worked effectively on Friday evening, though it planned to ''scrutinize how we can make it better,'' an official said.
The Secret Service said it had been tipped off to Mr. Ortega-Hernandez's whereabouts by a hotel employee who recognized a photograph of him and called the Pittsburgh field office. The field office alerted the Pennsylvania State Police, which dispatched troopers to the hotel.
Investigators established Mr. Ortega-Hernandez's route by talking to people who knew him, an official at the Secret Service said, and circulated photos of him to several hotels in the area. The investigation involved all of the Secret Service's 122 field offices in the United States, the official said.
The last known episode in which bullets struck the White House occurred in 1994, when one round fired from the area of the Ellipse penetrated a first-floor window and landed in the State Dining Room, and another was found in a Christmas tree near the South Portico. President Bill Clinton and his wife and daughter were sleeping upstairs. No one was hurt.

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Thursday about the arrest of a man suspected of shooting at the White House misidentified, at one point, the police agency that arrested him in Pennsylvania. As the article correctly noted elsewhere, it was the Pennsylvania State Police, not federal authorities. (The state police were acting on information from Secret Service agents.)

HEADLINE: Imagining Housing For Today

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN

 BODY:
Bronx Park East opened last year opposite the New York Botanical Garden. It consists of a five-story brick pavilion with triple-height windows facing the street, and a seven-story wing for 68 small studio apartments. ''A good neighbor,'' is how its designer, Jonathan Kirschenfeld, described the building's look.
Serious architecture is another way to describe Bronx Park East. It is a single-room occupancy residence, an S.R.O., built to house tenants who had been homeless. Sunny, with modest kitchens and full bathrooms, its apartments are smaller (around 285 square feet) than otherwise legally permitted for studios in New York because different rules apply to housing for social service clients. The building has a handsomely proportioned facade, spacious public rooms and light-filled hallways, none of it standard for an S.R.O.
The other morning a few residents were out on the sidewalk taking in the sun, chatting with people from next door. ''Isn't the idea here to improve mental health?'' Mr. Kirschenfeld said. ''Isn't good architecture part of that?'' 
It is, and Bronx Park East, like other S.R.O.'s Mr. Kirschenfeld has designed in the city, lends dignity to what at least used to be a byword for urban pariah and a building type that often resembled a prison.
But the project is exemplary for another reason, too.
Most new homes in the city today are still designed for nuclear families. According to the nonprofit Citizens Housing & Planning Council, two parents raising young children occupy only 17 percent of New York dwellings; another 9 percent house single parents with children under 25. The city meanwhile has a growing population of singles -- students, young professionals, immigrants, empty-nesters and the elderly -- who can't afford market-rate rentals. (That's not to mention a report last week from the Coalition for the Homeless, an advocacy group that has frequently clashed with the Bloomberg administration , which put the city's homeless population at 41,204, up from 31,000 a decade ago.)
Households have evolved. But New York's housing stock hasn't. In essence, New Yorkers have increasingly had to adapt to the housing we've got, instead of designing and building the housing that suits who we have become.
The problem? Partly, a collection of sometimes conflicting city and state laws that do things like dictate minimum room sizes, prohibit the construction of apartments without kitchens or bathrooms, and outlaw more than three or four unrelated people sharing an apartment. Other rules compel developers in many parts of town to construct a parking space for each new unit they build, a disincentive for designing many smaller, inexpensive apartments as opposed to just a few big ones, never mind what the rules imply for the environment.
Of course safety and fire concerns account for many codes. But together these good laws and outmoded ones have forced much of the city's housing population underground, into illegal shares and jerry-built apartments.
As David Burney, the city's commissioner for the Department of Design and Construction, put it the other day, ''The regulatory environment has fallen behind'' the times. So had a conspicuous part of the architecture world, which, until lately at least, focused on glamour projects rather than on how most people live.
In the past New York has adapted to changing household patterns. For example, grand Upper West Side apartments from a century ago were chopped up to provide more units for smaller families that no longer employed live-in servants . The question now is can the city become nimble again? Boston has zoned for micro-units to accommodate the young population and others struggling with market rates, on whom civic competitiveness and social equity ultimately depend. Can New York also meet the social and economic needs of the 21st century?
The Citizens Housing & Planning Council organized a conference the other day, in collaboration with the Architectural League, that tackled these questions. A clutch of city commissioners joined architects, among them Peter L. Gluck, Ted Smith, Deborah Gans, Rafi Segal and Mr. Kirschenfeld, who proposed new housing models. Their brief was to ignore existing codes and regulations that got in the way of innovative design but to stay real: to focus on what could actually happen in terms of safe, economical construction given a few tweaks to existing laws and putting aside intractable obstacles like rent control and rent stabilization.
As Fred A. Bernstein reported on the conclave in The New York Times on Sunday, not everyone was excited by the plans, including Robert D. LiMandri, commissioner of the Buildings Department, who said he kept worrying, ''How is the fireman going to get in there?'' Mr. Smith, a veteran of communal housing in San Diego, warned that communal kitchens cause internecine warfare and cool-looking convertible furniture, of the sort that a few speakers touted, tends to be expensive.
The larger truth is that wholesale change of the housing stock also can't happen without more efficient federal subsidies and reform of the mortgage system. But the exercise was instructive anyway. A better, more equitable city, with more smaller, smartly designed, adaptable apartments and houses, is within reach.
I was struck by a few proposals, including one from Mr. Gluck and his young team of collaborators. They envisioned a five-story walkup on a town-house-size New York lot. The building would accommodate 20 micro-lofts, as the team termed them, some 150 square feet each. With mini-kitchens, 14-foot ceilings and public spaces for residents to socialize and work together on each floor, the plan trades basics like an elevator for private space and lower building costs, as it also trades views for privacy: it imagines large windows, but extra close to the blank wall of the building next to it (another legal no-no). By doubling the number of apartments from the 10 or so that present zoning laws allow, the project could be economical for developers to build, Mr. Gluck argued, and rents could be low.
Mr. Segal, working with the architect Stan Allen, both from Brooklyn, explored the conversion of increasingly obsolete 1960s Midtown office towers into residences, and they imagined kibbutzlike communes atop low-rise, underdeveloped commercial buildings in neighborhoods like Inwood. More practically, Ms. Gans retrofitted Tudor Revival cottages in immigrant-rich areas like Astoria, Queens, so they could house an evolving assortment of singles and families who might want to live together. Her plan, with buildings cleverly massed and fitted into the existing fabric of the neighborhood, conceived of up to seven apartment ''pods'' (''barnacles'' became another operative metaphor) clinging to a 4,000-square-foot house.
But it was the proposal by Mr. Kirschenfeld and his collaborators that seemed most realistic. If the city simply applied existing laws to market housing for supportive projects like Bronx Park East, he said, it would in principle be possible tomorrow to create new high-density, low-rent apartment buildings.
He focused on revamping the Grand Concourse in the Bronx. ''The Concourse is one of the largest and longest rooms in the city,'' he said, ''and it can become an urban incubator for the city's young work force again.'' He imagined greening that once-vibrant boulevard in conjunction with building housing that mixes tiny apartments for singles and larger ones that can be shared and swapped by a shifting roster of families and unrelated groups, a kind of ''S.R.O. redux,'' as he put it. Including the Concourse, the plan broke down the wall between inside and outside, public and private, in ways that seemed well attuned to modern city life.
Back at Bronx Park East, the benefits of good, economical design were obvious. ''At the beginning there was opposition,'' Raymond Berisha, the building's 50-year-old superintendent, told me. I found him straightening up the terrace. He lived around the corner, he said. ''Like everybody in the neighborhood, I was surprised by how well this fits in, to be honest, but you know New York.''
It's a leap from an S.R.O. to inexpensive studio apartments and commune-style Tudor homes for young professionals and multigenerational families.
But the point is that we aren't stuck with the housing models we've already got.
And that we are what we build.

HEADLINE: The Smokers' Surcharge

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON

 BODY:
More and more employers are demanding that workers who smoke, are overweight or have high cholesterol shoulder a greater share of their health care costs, a shift toward penalizing employees with unhealthy lifestyles rather than rewarding good habits.
Policies that impose financial penalties on employees have doubled in the last two years to 19 percent of 248 major American employers recently surveyed. Next year, Towers Watson, the benefits consultant that conducted the survey, said the practice -- among employers with at least 1,000 workers -- was expected to double again. 
In addition, another survey released on Wednesday by Mercer, which advises companies, showed that about a third of employers with 500 or more workers were trying to coax them into wellness programs by offering financial incentives, like discounts on their insurance. So far, companies including Home Depot, PepsiCo, Safeway, Lowe's and General Mills have defended decisions to seek higher premiums from some workers, like Wal-Mart's recent addition of a $2,000-a-year surcharge for some smokers. Many point to the higher health care costs associated with smoking or obesity. Some even describe the charges and discounts as a ''more stick, less carrot'' approach to get workers to take more responsibility for their well-being. No matter the characterizations, it means that smokers and others pay more than co-workers who meet a company's health goals.
But some benefits specialists and health experts say programs billed as incentives for wellness, by offering discounted health insurance, can become punitive for people who suffer from health problems that are not completely under their control. Nicotine addiction, for example, may impede smokers from quitting, and severe obesity may not be easily overcome.
Earlier this year, the American Cancer Society and the American Heart Association were among groups that warned federal officials about giving companies too much latitude. They argued in a letter sent in March that the leeway afforded employers could provide ''a back door'' to policies that discriminate against unhealthy workers.
Kristin M. Madison, a professor of law and health sciences at Northeastern University in Boston, said, ''People are definitely worried that programs will be used to drive away employees or potential employees who are unhealthy.''
Current regulations allow companies to require workers who fail to meet specific standards to pay up to 20 percent of their insurance costs. The federal health care law raises that amount to 30 percent in 2014 and, potentially, to as much as half the cost of a policy.
When Wal-Mart Stores, the nation's largest employer, recently sought the higher payments from some smokers, its decision was considered unusual, according to benefits experts. The amount, reaching $2,000 more than for nonsmokers, was much higher than surcharges of a few hundred dollars a year imposed by other employers on their smoking workers.
And the only way for Wal-Mart employees to avoid the surcharges was to attest that their doctor said it would be medically inadvisable or impossible to quit smoking. Other employers accept enrollment in tobacco cessation programs as an automatic waiver for surcharges.
''This is another example of where it's not trying to create healthier options for people,'' said Dan Schlademan, director of Making Change at Walmart, a union-backed campaign that is sharply critical of the company's benefits. ''It looks a lot more like cost-shifting.''
Wal-Mart declined to make an official available for an interview and provided limited answers to questions through an e-mail response. ''The increase in premiums in tobacco users is directly related to the fact that tobacco users generally consume about 25 percent more health care services than nontobacco users,'' said Greg Rossiter, a company spokesman.
Wal-Mart requires an employee to have stopped smoking to qualify for lower premiums. The company, which has more than one million employees, started offering an antismoking program this year, and says more than 13,000 workers have enrolled.
Some labor experts contend that employers can charge workers higher fees only if they are tied to a broader wellness program, although federal rules do not define wellness programs.
Employers cannot discriminate against smokers by asking them to pay more for their insurance unless the surcharge is part of a broader effort to help them quit, said Karen L. Handorf, a lawyer who specializes in employee benefits for Cohen Milstein Sellers & Toll in Washington.
Many programs that ask employees to meet certain health targets offer rewards in the form of lower premiums. At Indiana University Health, a large health system, employees who do not smoke and achieve a certain body mass index, or B.M.I., can receive up to $720 a year off the cost of their insurance. ''It's all about the results,'' said Sheriee Ladd, a senior vice president in human resources at the system.
Initially the system also rewarded employees who met cholesterol and blood glucose goals, but after workers complained that those hurdles seemed punitive, Indiana shifted its emphasis a bit.
Workers who do not meet the weight targets can be eligible for lower premiums if a doctor indicates they have a medical condition that makes the goal unreasonable, Ms. Ladd said. ''There are not many of those who come forward, but it's available,'' she said, adding that workers must be nonsmoking to get the other discount. About 65 percent of roughly 16,000 workers receive a discount.
Some benefits consultants say companies may be increasingly willing to test the boundaries of the law because there has been little enforcement, even though there is a provision requiring employers to accommodate workers with medical conditions limiting their ability to meet certain standards. ''They are thumbing their nose at the accommodation provision,'' said Michael Wood, a consultant at Towers Watson.
Still, ''The employer is going to win not by cost-shifting but by getting people to stop smoking,'' said Barry Hall, an executive at Buck Consultants, which advises employers.
Some versions of tougher standards have already been abandoned. The UnitedHealth Group, for example, had introduced a health plan called Vital Measures, which allowed workers to reduce the size of their deductible by meeting various health targets, but discontinued the offering three years ago because of insufficient demand, according to a spokesman. The insurer now offers plans that allow employees to earn rewards by either achieving health targets or participating in a coaching program to improve their health.
Wal-Mart's decision to start charging smokers more for insurance came abruptly, according to some employees who say they had no chance to quit or consult a doctor. Jerome Allen, who works for Wal-Mart in Texas, says he realized he was paying $40 a month more as a smoking surcharge only when he saw a printout of his insurance coverage.
''Forty dollars is a lot of money,'' said Mr. Allen, 63, who works part time. He says he has now quit smoking.
Wal-Mart says it mailed information about benefits changes weeks in advance of the enrollment deadline.
Under Wal-Mart's programs, employees who want to enroll in some of the company's more generous plans, which offer lower deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums, can pay as much as $178 a month, or more than $2,000, a year more if they smoke.
Many other companies charge smokers a smaller, flat amount, and have kept any financial penalties under the 20 percent threshold set by the federal rules, according to benefits experts. Target, a Wal-Mart competitor, does not charge smokers more for insurance, while Home Depot charges a smoker $20 a month. PepsiCo requires smokers to pay $600 a year more than nonsmokers unless they complete an antismoking program.
Some critics say Wal-Mart's surcharge may have the effect of forcing people to opt for less expensive plans or persuade them to drop coverage altogether. Dr. Kevin Volpp, the director of the Center for Health Incentives and Behavioral Economics at the Leonard Davis Institute at the University of Pennsylvania, pointed out that surcharges and stringent health targets might wind up endangering those whose health was already at high risk. ''There is this potentially very significant set of unintended consequences,'' he said.

HEADLINE: The Cash-and-Carry House

BYLINE: By KATE MURPHY

 BODY:
THE house was just $1. The catch? A delivery charge of nearly $22,000.
Still, Julie and Randy Olson decided it was worth it. In 2007, they had bought 120 acres of farmland in Brook Park, Minn., only to see the value of their property plummet, along with their hopes of ever getting a construction loan to build a house.
And while the 4,200-square-foot wood-frame house they bought for a buck had been slated for demolition, it was solid, Ms. Olson said, with ''tight pine lumber and tongue-and-groove construction.''
Ms. Olson, 45, a game warden for the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, had heard about the house from a colleague who had listed it for public auction, to make way for a wildlife refuge. And the Olsons, it turned out, were the only bidders. 
But they are not the only ones to recognize that what might seem wildly impractical -- picking up a house and moving it somewhere else -- can, in fact, be the most practical thing to do when money is tight.
In recent years, more cash-strapped Americans have been doing just that: realizing the dream of homeownership on the cheap, by buying land and then hauling in inexpensive (or free) houses that would have otherwise been torn down. Many of these houses come from used-house lots, the domestic equivalent of used-car lots, where one can choose from a surprisingly wide range of styles, whether quaint shingled cottages or multistory houses.
There are no hard figures on how many homes are acquired this way, but while sales of stationary houses have been declining, sales of the peripatetic variety appear to be increasing.
Owners of used-house lots, particularly in the Pacific Northwest, on the Gulf and East Coasts and in the Upper Midwest, said their sales had increased as much as 60 percent over the last three years.
Warren Davie, the owner of Davie Shoring, a structural mover with a used-house lot in Kenner, La., outside New Orleans, said his business has increased 50 percent since 2008.
''It seems like we're even busier when the economy is bad,'' Mr. Davie said. ''People are looking for a way to save on demolition and dump fees on one end and save on building costs on the other end.''
Depending on a home's size, its condition and how far it has to be moved, the cost can range from $15,000 to $60,000.
That's about 40 to 60 percent of what it would cost to build the same structure from scratch, said Joshua Wendland, president of Milbank House Movers Inc., in Milbank, S.D., which sells and transports houses within a 500-mile radius. For the last three years, Mr. Wendland said, his business has increased about 15 percent annually.
These days, he added, ''If the weather is good, we move up to six houses a week.''
Buyers include developers who want the houses for rental income while they wait for financing to build larger projects and farmers flush with cash from high crop prices, who are upgrading their residences or providing housing for laborers. Natural-gas companies are also buying houses for workers who can't find lodging in sparsely populated drilling regions like North and South Dakota.
But Mr. Davie, who is on the board of the International Association of Structural Movers, the industry's trade group, said most buyers were ''hardworking people who don't want to go into serious debt to own a home and are willing to put a little sweat equity into the project.''
The Olsons fit that profile. In addition to the $21,500 they paid to move their house 30 miles, they plan to spend another $100,000 renovating it themselves. ''It's hard work, but it's going to be beautiful,'' said Mr. Olson, 48, a cattle farmer.
Cheryl Moore, 52, and her husband, Kenneth, 48, of Houston are also rolling up their sleeves. The couple, quality assurance employees at an oil-rig services company, have been working on a 1,200-square-foot Victorian-style house since August, when they moved it 130 miles from Houston to their property in Nacogdoches, Tex.
Ms. Moore found the house on the Web site of a local structural mover who got it from a developer who wanted to tear it down to build a snow-cone stand. The cost, plus shipping, was $47,500. Ms. Moore and her husband plan to invest another $100,000 to put on a new roof and add two bedrooms and two and a half bathrooms, work they will do themselves to save money.
''It's a great deal,'' Ms. Moore said, ''considering to build a house like this would cost us around $500,000.''
MOVING a house is, in theory, relatively simple.
If it is on a pier-and-beam foundation, structural movers slide steel beams under the ground floor to lift it; if the house is on a concrete slab, the mover uses a jackhammer to create tunnels where support beams can be inserted.
Then the house is raised on jacks, dollies are maneuvered beneath it, and the beams supporting the house are lowered onto the dollies, which have an integrated hydraulic suspension system that adjusts to the road, so that no part of the house is unduly stressed on the way.
''The equipment has improved by leaps and bounds in the past three to five years,'' said Keith Settle, president of Northwest Structural Moving, in the Portland, Ore., area, which has seen its business increase 25 percent annually since 2007.
Last year, Mr. Settle invested $250,000 in a new system that uses self-propelled dollies, instead of the kind that are hitched to a trailer truck. It operates by remote control, so he can walk alongside a house while it's being moved, making adjustments as it travels over uneven terrain.
Inevitably, it's a process that prompts spectators to reach for their cellphones to snap pictures. But as Edgar Dodson, secretary and treasurer of Dodson House Moving, in San Antonio, noted, ''We move along at about 15 to 20 miles per hour, so they've got to take the picture pretty quick.''
When it's your own house, the sight can be disconcerting.
''It's kind of freaky to watch your house coming down the road,'' said Steve Moon, 41, a lieutenant with the fire department in Cannon Beach, Ore.
Mr. Moon paid $25,000 to move a two-story house 10 blocks, and $10,000 of that, he said, ''was to deal with the wires.'' (Utilities charge hefty fees to lower or raise their wires so a house can pass.)
But the house itself, a solid cedar A-frame structure he now rents out, was free. It came to him serendipitously last year. The owners called his unit to do a so-called controlled-burn demolition, so they could build something new, and he offered to take it off their hands.
''When I saw it,'' he said, ''I was like, 'Holy cow, there's nothing wrong with this place.' ''
But most people come by their relocated houses more conventionally, through used-house lots or structural movers' Web sites. Other likely sources are large building companies and organizations that routinely clear land for building, safety or preservation projects: state highway departments, for example, or local flood control boards.
Joe Kessi, a real estate developer who buys used houses to place on vacant properties owned by his company, OHM Equity Partners L.L.C. in Scappoose, Ore., said he looks for houses ''anywhere there is a major building project, like a new road or new hospital being built.''
Then he starts ''calling around to find out who has the contract to do the demolitions,'' he said. ''I could go to any state and find a house.''
Contractors are usually happy to save money and avoid the hassle of getting demolition permits, and will simply give the houses to Mr. Kessi. That means moving and renovation are his only expenses.
''It cuts the cost of new-house construction by about a third,'' he said, making his properties competitive with foreclosures that banks are trying to sell cheaply.
But even during a recession, saving money isn't always the only consideration when it comes to moving houses.
Jennifer Davis, 38, a mediator in Everett, Wash., and her husband, Craig, a policeman, also 38, bought a 1,500-square-foot cottage in 2008 as a vacation home for a quarter-acre they owned on Hat Island. The local structural mover who sold the house to them charged $65,000, which included transporting it by barge across Puget Sound and then building a short bridge to span the last 100 yards, where the water was too shallow for the barge to pass.
Despite the obstacles, the damage caused by the move was limited to a few easy-to-repair hairline cracks. And Ms. Davis estimates that they saved about 40 percent of what it would have cost to build a house.
But the best part, she said, is ''it's a 1950s rambler with all kinds of details, like scalloped trim in the kitchen and a wonderful pink bathroom, that you don't find in new construction.''
And ''we saved it from a landfill.''
So That's How They Do It
FOR anyone who has ever suffered through the agony of a move (towers of boxes, miles of packing tape, untold numbers of annoyed friends), it seems like the ideal solution: just take the whole darn house, beds and all, and plop it in another location.
That is exactly the specialty of the International Association of Structural Movers, a trade group whose members shift homes from one address to the next, in toto. Keith Settle, the owner of Northwest Structural Moving in the Portland, Ore., area, is one such big-box specialist and offered a few rules.
DIG IT Just like repotting a plant, moving a building requires digging up the roots -- or the foundation, in this case. Unlike repotting a plant, it also calls for using a mighty piece of equipment called an excavator, an image of which you can probably find in any children's book devoted to big machines.
SHIMS, CRIBS AND OTHER GOOD SCRABBLE WORDS After digging around the building's base, crews typically install a series of wooden boxes known as cribs under the structure. Holes are poked through the walls of the foundation and steel beams inserted underneath, creating a web of support for a structure that is probably more wobbly than an adjustable-rate mortgage. ''Most people think buildings are built perfectly straight,'' Mr. Settle said. ''In reality, they aren't even close.'' So workers correct those problems with wooden shims, which stabilize the building.
NO DISASSEMBLY REQUIRED Little needs to be done to the building's interior, and indeed, some homes remain completely furnished. ''You do not have to take anything out,'' Mr. Settle said, noting that the contents are light in proportion to the weight of the actual structure.
UP AND AWAY The actual lifting is done by hydraulic jacks, which are probably quicker than your average Joe trying to change a tire. Synchronized, they can lift a building more than a foot in two minutes. Not that everything comes along for the ride: the foundation is detached before any lifting is done.
DO NOT -- REPEAT -- DO NOT DROP HOUSE Levitation is the trickiest element of the move, as equipment failure can result in severe damage or destruction of the house -- and anyone working on it.
DO NOT -- REPEAT -- DO NOT FOLLOW THE HOUSE Once the structure is about four feet off the ground, it goes mobile, as wheels are placed under it. Those wheels can be attached to a truck or steered with a joystick, something Mr. Settle likens to playing a video game. (Mario House, anyone?) The house is then driven to its new locale, at about the pace of a student driver. Mr. Settle said they drive slowly, but, depending on the condition of roads, can reach 40 to 45 miles an hour.
YOU CAN GO HOME AGAIN Once the building arrives at its new location, it is lowered into place, using jacks, and allowed to settle into its new neighborhood. All of which, he said, is exciting to watch, for homeowner and mover alike. ''If you don't love that moment of moving buildings,'' he said, ''you should probably find a different line of work.''

HEADLINE: From Shore to Forest, Projecting Effects of Climate Change

BYLINE: By LESLIE KAUFMAN

 BODY:
While the long-term outlook for grape-growers in the Finger Lakes region is favorable, it is less than optimal for skiers and other winter sports enthusiasts in the Adirondacks. Fir and spruce trees are expected to die out in the Catskills, and New York City's backup drinking water supply may well be contaminated as a result of seawater making its way farther up the Hudson River.
These possibilities -- modeled deep into this century -- are detailed in a new assessment of the impact that climate change will have in New York State. The 600-page report, published on Wednesday, was commissioned by the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, a public-benefit corporation, and is a result of three years of work by scientists at state academic institutions, including Columbia and Cornell Universities and the City University of New York. 
Its authors say it is the most detailed study that looks at how changes brought about by a warming Earth -- from rising temperatures to more precipitation and global sea level rise -- will affect the economy, the ecology and even the social fabric of the state.
Cynthia Rosenzweig, a senior research scientist at Columbia's Earth Institute, said the report was much broader in scope than earlier efforts by New York City that tried to evaluate how best to prepare for climate change.
''New York City's report focuses on how climate change will affect critical structures'' like bridges and sewage systems, she said. ''This report also looks at public health, agriculture, transportation and economics.''
The authors drew on results from global climate models and then created projections for variables like rainfall and temperatures for seven regions across the state. Then they tried to assess how those alterations would play out in specific terms. They also developed adaptation recommendations for different economic sectors.
If carbon emissions continue to increase at their current pace, for example, temperatures are expected to rise across the state by 3 degrees Fahrenheit by the 2020s and by as much as 9 degrees by the 2080s. That would have profound effects on agriculture across the state, the report found. For example, none of the varieties of apples currently grown in New York orchards would be viable. Dairy farms would be less productive as cows faced heat stress. And the state's forests would be transformed; spruce-fir forests and alpine tundra would disappear as invasive species like kudzu, an aggressive weed, gained more ground.
If the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets melt, as the report says could happen, the sea level could rise by as much as 55 inches, which means that beach communities would frequently be inundated by flooding.
''In 2020, nearly 96,000 people in the Long Beach area alone may be at risk from sea-level rise,'' the report said, referring to just one oceanfront community on the South Shore of Long Island. ''By 2080, that number may rise to more than 114,500 people. The value of property at risk in the Long Beach area under this scenario ranges from about $6.4 billion in 2020 to about $7.2 billion in 2080.''
The report found that the effects of climate change would fall disproportionately on the poor and the disabled.
In coastal areas in New York City and along rivers in upstate New York, it said, there is a high amount of low-income housing that would be in the path of flooding.
Art DeGaetano, a professor of earth and atmospheric sciences at Cornell, said that its findings need not be interpreted as totally devastating.
''It would be all bad if you wanted a static New York, with the same species of bird and the same crops,'' he said, ''but there will be opportunities as well. We expect, for example, that New York State will remain water-rich and we may be able to capitalize when other parts of the country are having severe drought.''
The next step, the authors said, is for them to meet with state agencies and try to work with them to carry out some of the report's recommendations of ways to cope with climate change
One would be to get the state to routinely incorporate projections of increased sea levels and heavy downpours when building big infrastructure projects. They also suggested protecting and nursing natural barriers to sea-level rise, like coastal wetlands, and changing building codes in certain area for things like roof strength and foundation depth in areas that would be hit hardest by storms.
''If there is one thing we learned from Hurricane Irene,'' Dr. Rosenzweig said referring to the tropical storm that pummeled the state this past summer, ''we have a lot more we could be doing to prepare.''

HEADLINE: Judge Temporarily Bars Eviction of Boston Protesters

BYLINE: By JESS BIDGOOD; Malia Wollan contributed reporting from Oakland, Dan Frosch from Denver, Steven Yaccino from Chicago, Ian Lovett from Los Angeles, Lee van der Voo from Portland, Robbie Brown from Atlanta, and Elizabeth A. Harris and Timothy Williams from New York.

 BODY:
BOSTON -- A judge granted a temporary order on Wednesday requiring the city to refrain from any police action to evict the Occupy Boston demonstrators from Dewey Square, where a small city of about 150 tents has functioned for a month and a half.
Judge Frances A. McIntyre, citing the protesters' right to free speech in her decision, said the city would need a court order in order to evict protesters, unless there are emergent circumstances like a fire, medical emergency or outbreak of violence.
''What the plaintiffs can point to is that abridgment of First Amendment rights is irreparable harm,'' Judge McIntyre said.
While police officers have raided protest sites in cities like New York, Oakland, Calif., and Portland, Ore., law enforcement in Boston has been relatively tolerant of the original encampment, although an attempt last month to expand the camp there was met with more than 140 arrests. City officials say that, although they are monitoring the demonstration daily, they have no plans to move in on the camp in Dewey Square, which is a public park. 
But after hearing of the New York Police Department's raid on Occupy Wall Street on Tuesday morning, Howard Cooper, a lawyer working in cooperation with local chapters of the National Lawyers Guild and the American Civil Liberties Union, filed for a temporary restraining order and a more permanent injunction that could prevent a similar surprise raid.
''Looking around and seeing what's going on around the country, we just worry that something might happen here in Boston,'' Urszula Masny-Latos, executive director of the Massachusetts chapter of the National Lawyers Guild, said on Tuesday.
A lawyer for the city, William F. Sinnott, argued that it needed to be able to evict protesters without warning because officials did not want to give protesters a chance to mobilize.
While protesters are calling the ruling a victory, the order will last only until a decision is made at the injunction hearing, set for Dec. 1. Judge McIntyre said the issues she will weigh at that hearing will include how Occupy Boston, which, like its sister protests across the country, has no designated leaders or official representatives, can be a party to such a lawsuit, as well as whether occupation truly constitutes expression that must be protected under the first amendment. Judge McIntyre ordered both sides to engage in mediation before that hearing.
Meanwhile, the police in San Francisco arrested seven people and dismantled part of the demonstrators' downtown encampment Wednesday morning. The officers, dressed in riot gear, let stand most of the tents belonging to Occupy protesters, but cleared a section of tents that had been built on a sidewalk, according to The Associated Press.
Across the bay at the University of California at Berkeley, protesters pitched tents on campus, despite a warning from university officials.
On Tuesday night, thousands of people showed up at the university's Sproul Plaza to vote on whether to erect tents and to listen to a speech by Robert Reich, a public policy professor at Berkeley who was secretary of labor in the Clinton administration.
Campus police had not removed the tents by Wednesday morning, according to The Associated Press. A previous attempt to put up tents on campus last week was thwarted by the police, who were accused by protesters of using unnecessary force.
In Seattle, several protesters were hit with pepper spray by the police on Tuesday night, including a woman who told officers she was three months pregnant, according to the Seattle police. ''Pepper spray was deployed only against subjects who were either refusing a lawful order to disperse or engaging in assaultive behavior toward officers,'' the police said in a statement. The police said they made six arrests, including a 17-year-old girl who swung a stick at an officer but missed.
Protesters around the nation have said the break up of Occupy Wall Street by New York police on Tuesday would have little impact on their own demonstrations.
At several encampments, demonstrators who had watched the nighttime police raid in New York via live video streamed on the Internet and over Twitter and Facebook, said that while the Wall Street protest at Zuccotti Park had been their model and given them inspiration, they had no intention of halting their own demonstrations in response.
''I obviously think this is pretty devastating,'' said Becca Chavez, 29, who has participated in Occupy Denver, which itself has had a series of run-ins with the police in recent weeks, leading to dozens of arrests. ''It was hard to watch. I think because New York was a symbol for so much, if anything, this will get people involved. What they had set up in Zuccotti Park was a community. They really know what they were doing. I think this will really pull a lot of people in who would have not otherwise thought of getting involved.''
At Occupy Oakland, which has been raided twice by the police -- once with officers using tear gas and projectiles against demonstrators -- one protester, Alexandra Hernandez, 22, said Tuesday that while Occupy Wall Street had served as a beacon for other protests, its existence was no longer necessary for the other demonstrations to continue.
''At the beginning, Zuccotti Park was essential for the movement,'' she said. ''When I saw the park for the first time, it made me think this was possible. It was physical evidence of a movement. To have a physical location was really important. It was different than anything that I'd seen in my lifetime.''
But she said that in light of the recent mass arrests of Occupy protesters across the country, it might be time for a shift in strategy.
''The physical encampments have been an important symbol of this movement -- it's a taking back of public space,'' she said. ''There are a lot of people that still want to struggle to have encampments again. I don't know if the encampments will continue.''
Occupy demonstrations are intentionally leaderless, and protesters in different cities act independently of one another with each group making decisions about what to protest -- though most of the camps appeared to have coalesced around opposition to growing disparities in individual wealth, the perceived greed of corporations and financial institutions, and high unemployment levels.
While many cities originally welcomed the protests after encampments began popping up about two months ago, the autonomy of the different sites has flummoxed law enforcement officers, many of whom have struggled with how to deal with them.
More recently, cities began enforcing prohibitions on camping and bans on tents.
And during the last several days, prior to the New York raid, authorities in Salt Lake City and Portland, Ore., as well as in Oakland and Denver, cracked down on the camps, making hundreds of arrests and flattening tents. Local officials said the camps had become public nuisances with sanitation, drug and other crime problems.
Latron Price, 37, an organizer of Occupy Atlanta, said Tuesday he believed the raid on Occupy Wall Street was a sign that the protests had struck a nerve.
''To see that happen in New York shows we're on the right track,'' he said. ''These arrests will only strengthen the protests elsewhere.''

HEADLINE: Markets Plunge on Report Of Risk to U.S. Banks

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Stocks tumbled on Wednesday as Fitch Ratings said further contagion from Europe's debt crisis will pose a risk to American banks and concerns rose that higher oil prices would hamper economic growth.
Financial shares led the losers on the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index as Citigroup and Morgan Stanley dropped at least 4.1 percent. Dell sank 3.2 percent as the personal computer maker told investors to expect slower sales growth for the rest of the year. Abercrombie & Fitch tumbled 14 percent as profit at the clothing retailer trailed estimates. Rambus fell 61 percent after losing a jury trial against Micron Technology and Hynix Semiconductor. Micron surged 23 percent.
The S.& P. 500 slid 20.90 points, or 1.66 percent, to 1,236.91. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 190.57 points, or 1.58 percent, to 11,905.59. The Nasdaq composite index fell 46.59 points, or 1.73 percent, to 2,639.61. 
Oil rose above $100 a barrel.
''It's fear of the unknown spooking the market,'' Madelynn Matlock, an investment manager at Huntington Asset Advisors in Cincinnati, said in a telephone interview. ''There may be more exposure to Europe out there than people really think, even if banks think they are covered. It's going to be a tough market for quite a while,'' she said. ''Increasing oil prices is a concern because it's like a tax on the consumer.''
Stocks extended losses after Fitch said that while lenders in the United States have ''manageable direct exposures'' to Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain, further turmoil in those markets poses a ''serious risk.'' Equities also fell after the Bank of England governor, Mervyn King, said Britain faced a ''markedly weaker'' outlook for the economy as Europe's crisis threatened global growth.
Diversified financial companies slumped the most among 24 industries in the S.& P. 500, losing 3.9 percent as a group. Dell slumped 3.2 percent to $15.13. The company missed third-quarter revenue estimates after walking away from $2 billion in potential PC sales to focus on more profitable technology and preserve margins, the vice chairman, Jeff Clarke, told analysts on Tuesday.
Rambus plummeted after losing a $3.95 billion jury trial over its allegations that Micron and Hynix conspired to prevent its memory chips from becoming an industry standard.
Marathon Petroleum, HollyFrontier and other American refiners declined on an announcement that the Seaway pipeline would be reversed, which may raise the costs of crude and narrow profits from making fuel.
Benchmark gauges briefly recovered as Eric Rosengren, president of the Boston Federal Reserve, said Europe's debt crisis might warrant coordinated action by the Fed and the European Central Bank. Earlier Wednesday, economic reports also limited losses. Industrial production in the United States rose 0.7 percent in October, more than the 0.4 percent median forecast. Confidence among home builders unexpectedly climbed in November.
''The economic data has been getting better, but I don't think the market should look at that thinking all is fine,'' Wasif Latif, vice president of equity investments at USAA Investment Management in San Antonio, said in a telephone interview. ''There's a probability that Europe goes back into recession. That can put pressure on the rest of the world,'' he said. ''When oil goes up, consumers feel that in their pocketbooks.''

HEADLINE: Berkeley Has Plan to Start A Program In Shanghai

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

 BODY:
SHANGHAI -- The University of California, Berkeley announced this week that it plans to open a large research and teaching facility here as part of a broader plan to bolster its presence in China.
The public university, which is struggling under budget constraints imposed by the state of California, said the Shanghai center would cater to engineering graduate students and be financed over the next five years largely by the Shanghai government and companies operating here. The program is expected to begin in July 2012.
Berkeley's announcement comes as other prominent American universities are racing to build closer ties to China, hoping to attract new students, deepen research capabilities and set up sites to train business professionals to succeed in the booming Chinese market. New York University and Duke University are each building a campus in the Shanghai area, and Stanford is building a $5 million research center on the campus of the elite Peking University in the city of Beijing. 
''This will be a platform or base of operations for us'' said Tsu-Jae King Liu, a professor of electrical engineering and computer sciences at Berkeley, and the associate dean for research at the College of Engineering. ''A major reason to do this is to enhance the opportunities for our students. We want them to be better prepared to become global leaders.''
China is eager to attract branches of world-class universities in the hope of upgrading its own universities. And big cities like Beijing and Shanghai are pushing for partnerships with prestigious American institutions to attract top students and to create research and development centers that they hope will form the base of a modern, high-tech economy.
The scramble to set up American programs here is happening at a time when Chinese students are flocking to America's best colleges and universities and elite boarding schools. Chinese student enrollments in the United States are strengthening university budgets because many of the students are paying full college tuitions, which can range from $15,000 to $50,000 a year.
Last week, the Institute of International Education, a nonprofit group in New York, said nearly 158,000 Chinese students were enrolled in American colleges and universities this academic year. That figure was up about 23 percent from the previous year and was the second consecutive year China topped India on the list of countries sending international students to the United States.
American college administrators say creating programs here will help support fundraising efforts that target wealthy Chinese alumni; it could also help recruit undergraduate students and strengthen research programs by utilizing resources at Chinese institutions.
Some education experts warn, though, that the universities could damage their reputations if the programs in China came to be viewed as lowering standards or profiting from charging high tuition, but relying on local, low-cost teaching staffs.
The Chinese government requires foreign colleges and universities to form a partnership with a local institution, or be approved by the government. Such programs vary widely. In Berkeley's case, the university has signed a memorandum of understanding to open its Shanghai facility at the Zhangjiang High-Tech Park, a sprawling government-controlled campus that has attracted global companies like DuPont, Sony, Honeywell and Lenovo.
What is unusual is that the Shanghai government and the company that operates the high-tech park have agreed to build a 50,000-square-foot building for Berkeley at no cost, with a five-year rent-free lease.
The Zhangjiang High-Tech Park also agreed to raise at least $10 million a year over the next five years to finance Berkeley research in collaboration with Chinese institutions.
The agreement was made with Berkeley's College of Engineering, which has a reputation for training some of the world's most capable engineers and computer scientists. The center will be established for graduate students who gain admission to Berkeley's main campus, as well as Berkeley-appointed researchers. There is no plan to establish an undergraduate or degree-granting program here.
Several other Berkeley professional schools, including the Haas School of Business and the Law School, are also considering initiatives in China. Berkeley's chancellor, Robert Birgeneau, and the dean of its engineering school, S. Shankar Sastry, were in Shanghai last weekend to sign the agreement.

HEADLINE: Re-election Strategy Is Tied to a Shift on Smog

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The summons from the president came without warning the Thursday before Labor Day. As she was driven the four blocks to the White House, Lisa P. Jackson, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, suspected that the news would not be good. What she did not see coming was a rare public rebuke the president was about to deliver by rejecting her proposal to tighten the national standard for smog.
The half-hour meeting in the Oval Office was not a negotiation; the president had decided against ratcheting up the ozone rule because of the cost and the uncertainty it would impose on industry and local governments. He clearly understood the scientific, legal and political implications. He told Ms. Jackson that she would have an opportunity to revisit the Clean Air Act standard in 2013 -- if they were still in office. We are just not going to do this now, he said.
The White House announced the decision the next morning, infuriating environmental and public health advocates. They called it a bald surrender to business pressure, an act of political pandering and, most galling, a cold-blooded betrayal of a loyal constituency. 
''This was the worst thing a Democratic president had ever done on our issues,'' said Gene Karpinski, president of the League of Conservation Voters. ''Period.''
The full retreat on the smog standard was the first and most important environmental decision of the presidential campaign season that is now fully under way. An examination of that decision, based on interviews with lobbyists on both sides, former officials and policy makers at the upper reaches of the White House and the E.P.A., illustrates the new calculus on political and policy shifts as the White House sharpens its focus on the president's re-election.
Industry groups and their Republican allies praised the move, which leaves a far more lenient ozone rule in place for at least a year. But then they reeled off a dozen other proposed environmental, labor and health regulations they also wanted killed.
In the weeks since that decision, the administration has made a number of other environmental decisions, sending mixed messages that left both environmentalists and industry lobbyists perplexed.
Two major clean air rules have been delayed, at least temporarily. The Interior Department announced a significant expansion of offshore drilling in the Arctic and the Gulf of Mexico over the next five years. Last week, the administration bowed to pressure from protesters, environmental groups, and residents and officials in Nebraska in announcing that it would delay a decision on the bitterly contested Keystone XL oil pipeline until after the 2012 election. Taken together, the moves mark the White House's growing awareness of the costs of environmental regulation in a battered economy.
The ozone decision pitted Ms. Jackson, a Princeton-trained chemical engineer and self-described ''New Orleans girl,'' against the White House chief of staff, William M. Daley, a son and brother of bare-knuckled Chicago mayors who was brought in to help repair relations with business and Congress. It also shows the clout of Cass R. Sunstein, the legal powerhouse who serves, mostly behind the scenes, as the president's regulatory czar with the mission of keeping the costs of regulation under control.
While Mr. Daley has recently given up some responsibilities at the White House, he remains the administration's conduit for business interests.
The ozone decision was jarring because it was wholly unexpected. Ms. Jackson considered resigning but soon abandoned the idea as a futile gesture.
Many of the president's supporters remain unsettled, fearing that the ozone decision meant he was abandoning environmental issues. But White House officials cite two major vehicle emissions rules, the pipeline delay and the president's stated promise to carry through on other clean air measures as evidence of the administration's devotion to their causes.
Revisiting a Law
In his inaugural address, Mr. Obama promised to ''restore science to its rightful place'' in making government environmental policy. He also pledged to revisit environmental rules set by the administration of George W. Bush that his administration felt were too weak.
The standard for ozone was last set in 2008 by the Bush administration at a level of 75 parts per billion, above the range of 60 to 70 recommended by the E.P.A.'s scientific advisory panel at the time, but never enacted. Environmental and public health groups challenged the Bush standard in court, saying it would endanger human health and had been tainted by political interference. Smog levels have declined sharply over the last 40 years, but each incremental improvement comes at a significant cost to business and government.
So Ms. Jackson asked health and environmental groups to hold their lawsuit in abeyance while she reconsidered the ozone standard, a job she expected to complete by the summer of 2010. Until then, an outdated ozone standard of 84 parts per billion, set by the E.P.A. of the Bill Clinton administration in 1997, remained the law.
Delay followed delay until the spring of this year, when Ms. Jackson determined that the standard should be set at 65 parts per billion to meet the Clean Air Act's requirement that it be protective of public health ''with an adequate margin of safety.'' At 65 parts per billion, the agency calculated, as many as 7,200 deaths, 11,000 emergency room visits and 38,000 acute cases of asthma would be avoided each year.
Ms. Jackson knew that standard would cause political heartburn at the White House, so before submitting it she met with Mr. Daley at least three times in June to try to deal with any concerns. Mr. Daley, rightly sensing the uproar from business and local governments at the cost of meeting such a standard, sharply questioned the costs and burdens as well as the timing of the new rule but never explicitly asked her to hold off or pull back.
Ms. Jackson went back to her suite in a large office complex off Pennsylvania Avenue to huddle with aides and tweak the proposal.
She returned to Mr. Daley with a compromise, agreeing to settle for a somewhat weaker standard, at the upper limit of the recommendations of the E.P.A.'s scientific advisory board, as well as measures to provide significant flexibility in compliance.
Ms. Jackson thought she had a deal. In early July she sent the White House a 500-page package with a detailed cost-benefit analysis for what she assumed would be routine vetting and approval.
''We were absolutely, 100-percent certain we were going to get this ozone rule,'' one senior E.P.A. official said.
Counteraction
The business community and its Republican allies in Congress went to war.
The ozone rule became a symbol of what opponents called a ''regulatory jihad'' and brought out a swarm of industry lobbyists and Republicans in Congress who identified it as one of their top targets. They organized letter-writing campaigns, ran ads in journals seen by Washington policy makers and put the ozone rule at the top of the list of administration environmental initiatives they wanted repealed in the fall. They claimed the rule would cost $90 billion a year -- far above E.P.A.'s estimates -- and put much of the industrial heartland out of business. Local and state officials complained to Congress and the White House that they lacked the resources to enforce the new rule. Even some Democratic lawmakers warned the White House that the regulation would damage their re-election prospects.
Against all this, there was no one lobbying strongly within the White House for the tougher standard. Carol M. Browner, a former E.P.A. administrator who had served as the White House coordinator for energy and environmental policy, left earlier this year as Mr. Daley was taking over because she sensed those issues were taking a back seat to economic and political concerns.
Mr. Daley abolished her job, leaving no one in the current White House who speaks as forcefully on environmental issues as she did.
Another Voice
In charge of Mr. Obama's effort to reduce regulatory costs and burdens was Mr. Sunstein, on leave from teaching at Harvard and a onetime colleague of Mr. Obama's at the University of Chicago Law School. One of the most respected liberal legal scholars of his generation, he is known for his at-times unconventional thinking on regulation and economic behavior.
Mr. Sunstein had his pick of jobs in the new administration. He chose the obscure regulatory affairs office as a potential laboratory for his sometimes iconoclastic views. He has challenged the utility of command-and-control-style federal regulation and has written favorably of programs to ''name and shame'' polluters as a way of getting them to clean up their operations without enforcement actions or fines. He has sought creative ways to encourage responsible economic and environmental behavior without using the heavy hand of the state.
Mr. Sunstein never really warmed to the proposed ozone rule, not least because it would, by law, be subject to revision again in 2013. He also noted that in nearly half of the E.P.A.'s own case studies, the cost of the new rule would outweigh the benefits, raising additional alarms.
One outside adviser, who watched the process closely but declined to be identified for fear of losing access to policy makers, said the ozone rule provided the perfect opportunity for Mr. Sunstein to make his mark.
''Cass was itching, itching, itching to send a return letter,'' the adviser said.
Early Objections
Although she was under intense pressure from business and Congressional Republicans over the proposed rule, Ms. Jackson believed the White House would back her. In mid-July, she hosted a delegation of trade group officials at E.P.A. headquarters so they could present their concerns. Among those present were leaders of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, the Business Roundtable and the American Petroleum Institute.
They tried a hard sell, according to R. Bruce Josten, the chief lobbyist for the Chamber of Commerce, noting that the new rule would push hundreds of counties out of compliance with the Clean Air Act and force them to devise costly new air pollution control plans. They suggested she wait until the next review in 2013.
''Lisa is very smart, cordial, friendly,'' Mr. Josten said of Ms. Jackson. ''She listened to us, but then talked about how important it was to do this, the lung thing, the asthma thing, the kids' health thing. She felt it was important to go ahead.''
Mr. Josten added: ''The funny thing was nobody wanted to come right out and say, 'Are you guys thinking this through? Your boss is up for re-election next year, do you really want to shut down industrial permitting? You're going to have a major negative impact on the economy.' ''
The executives left frustrated. Ms. Jackson knew their efforts were just beginning.
Maneuvering
The business lobbyists started working the White House, securing a series of meetings with mid-level staff members in July. Mr. Daley and Mr. Sunstein agreed to meet with them on Aug. 16, the same day they were to meet with public health and environmental groups.
For the West Wing gathering that day, Jack N. Gerard, the pugnacious head of the American Petroleum Institute, brought maps showing the areas that would be out of compliance with the proposed regulation in a vivid swath of red states across the Midwest and along the East Coast, states that Mr. Obama won in 2008. They did not need to spell out the implications.
''The maps were on the table,'' said Khary Cauthen, director of federal relations for the petroleum group and a White House environmental adviser in the Bush administration. ''One of the C.E.O.'s had a whole spiel he was going to do, 'This is so bad here, so bad there,' but Daley shut him up. He was like, 'I got that.' ''
John Engler, the former Republican governor of Michigan and president of the Business Roundtable, noted the burden to state and local officials. ''I told him, 'When there's a cloud over your head about whether you're going to be able to meet the new standard, you're likely to lose new business to some other state,' '' Mr. Engler said, referring to Mr. Daley.
Mr. Daley was well aware of state and local concerns. One of the strongest appeals came from North Carolina, a state Mr. Obama narrowly won in 2008. The state's governor, Bev Perdue, a Democrat, argued against the new ozone rule. Her air quality director, B. Keith Overcash, wrote the E.P.A. pleading for a delay. ''Lack of employment, loss of health care, and in some cases, loss of a home, also affect the health of our citizens,'' he said.
''The governors had a big role,'' Mr. Engler said. ''They were very helpful.''
A few hours later, the other side gathered around the same table in the Roosevelt Room. Mr. Daley, Mr. Sunstein and Gina McCarthy, the top clean air official at the E.P.A., sat at the table; a half-dozen more junior aides lined the walls.
Charles D. Connor, president of the American Lung Association and a childhood friend of Mr. Daley's, opened by discussing the adverse health impacts of ozone. He introduced Monica Kraft, a pulmonologist at Duke University and the president-elect of the American Thoracic Society.
''I told them that we thought a 70 p.p.b. standard was appropriate for health reasons and laid out the statistics on deaths associated with progressively higher levels of ozone,'' Dr. Kraft said. She emphasized the damage smog does to the lungs of even healthy young children.
Mr. Daley listened politely, then asked, ''What are the health impacts of unemployment?'' It was a question straight out of the industry playbook.
Another member of the group introduced polling data showing strong public support for tougher air rules. Mr. Daley cut him off with an expletive, saying he was not interested in polls.
Daniel J. Weiss of the Center for American Progress presented data showing little difference in employment and economic growth in areas required to adopt stricter ozone standards than those that did not. Mr. Daley nodded but said nothing.
As the meeting was breaking up, Mr. Daley said, ''As you know, it's a very difficult economic time.''
Still, the group left believing that the rule would go forward.
The Decision
The timing turned out to be terrible. The White House was locked in an ugly battle with Republicans over raising the debt ceiling, job creation had stalled and the presidential campaign was already under way with a singular focus on Mr. Obama's stewardship of the foundering economy. The president was preparing a speech on job creation to a joint session of Congress even as he was considering a regulation that many -- including governors of politically pivotal states like North Carolina and Ohio -- warned could cost thousands of jobs.
For the next two weeks, none of the parties, including the E.P.A. leadership, heard anything from the White House about ozone. Mr. Obama returned to Washington from vacation near the end of August with a heavy menu of economic decisions before him. He wanted the ozone matter behind him and called Ms. Jackson into his office on Sept. 1 to break the news.
''There was always a notion that they were looking for a regulation to use as an example of the reform initiative, a poster child, and this was potentially it,'' said a senior E.P.A. official who asked not to be identified on a matter involving discussions with the White House. ''We knew one was coming. We just didn't know which one.''
Since Mr. Obama took office, Mr. Sunstein's agency has reviewed more than 1,800 rules. Most were approved with some changes and set into law. About 130, including 11 from the E.P.A., were voluntarily and quietly pulled back for further work.
Only one -- the ozone standard -- was so publicly rejected.
Mr. Sunstein would not discuss his communications with the president, but Mr. Obama is known to prefer concisely written memos to long oral briefings. The president's brief public statement turning back the proposed ozone rule closely mirrored Mr. Sunstein's letter to Ms. Jackson.
In an interview, Mr. Sunstein said the rejection of the rule resulted from a long and detailed analysis.
''This decision was made on the merits and not on politics,'' he said. ''There isn't an agreement to do things until the process runs its course. There is sometimes a surprise.''
In a letter rejecting her standard, he reminded Ms. Jackson of the president's executive order in January that all proposed regulations ''must promote predictability and reduce uncertainty.''
Although Mr. Sunstein was not present in the Oval Office when Mr. Obama delivered the news to Ms. Jackson, Mr. Daley was there, but stayed mostly silent.

HEADLINE: As New Graduates Return to Nest, Economy Also Feels the Pain

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL

 BODY:
Like most of her friends, Hollis Romanelli graduated from college last May and promptly moved back in with her parents.
As a result, she didn't pay rent -- or a broker's fee or renters' insurance, for that matter. She also didn't buy a bed, desk, couch, doormat, mop or new crockery set. Nor did she pay the cable company to send a worker to set up her TV and Internet, or a handyman to hang a newly framed diploma. She didn't even buy drinks and snacks for a housewarming party.
In other words, Ms. Romanelli, 22, saved a lot of money. But she deprived the economy of a lot of potential activity, too. 
Every year, young adults leave the nest, couples divorce, foreigners immigrate and roommates separate, all helping drive economic growth when they furnish and refurbish their new homes. Under normal circumstances, each time a household is formed it adds about $145,000 to output that year as the spending ripples through the economy, estimates Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics.
But with the poor job market and uncertain recovery, hundreds of thousands of Americans like Ms. Romanelli (and her boyfriend, who also lives with his parents) have tabled their moves. Even before the recession began, young people were leaving home later; now the bad economy has tethered them there indefinitely. Last year, just 950,000 new households were created. By comparison, about 1.3 million new households were formed in 2007, the year the recession began, according to Mr. Zandi. Ms. Romanelli, who lives in the room where she grew up in Branford, Conn., said, ''I don't really have much of a choice,'' adding, ''I don't have the means to move out.''
Ms. Romanelli, who works as an assistant editor at Cottages & Gardens magazines, is one of the luckier ''boomerang'' children who have found jobs and at least can start saving for their own place someday. As of last month, just 74 percent of Americans ages 25 to 34 were working. It is perhaps no wonder then that 14.2 percent of young adults are living with their parents, up from 11.8 percent in 2007. Among young men, 19 percent are living with their parents.
But even some young people who can afford to move out have decided to wait until getting on more solid footing. Prudence, not necessity, has kept them at home.
Jay Bouvier, 26, has a full-time job teaching physical education and health and coaching football and baseball at a high school in Hartford, near his parents' house in Bristol. He could rent his own apartment -- after taxes he makes about $45,000 a year, he says -- but has decided not to. He says he will stay with his parents until he has saved enough to buy his own house.
''I have it pretty good at home, since it's so close to my work, and financially I just feel like it's smarter for the long run to buy,'' he said. He says that living with his parents enables him to set aside about half of each paycheck. ''It's like I pay rent, but to myself.''
By not paying rent, of course, he has deprived a local landlord and a host of other local companies of some income, as well as whatever businesses those purveyors might have patronized further down the line. It's a phenomenon that John Maynard Keynes referred to as the ''paradox of thrift'': Saving is good for the individual, but en masse can hurt the economy by reducing demand.
''Increased housing demand definitely has multiplier effects throughout the economy,'' said Gary D. Painter, a professor at the University of Southern California and director of research for the university's Lusk Center for Real Estate. ''We have these sort of missing potential households,'' he said, which also means ''missing'' sales and jobs in industries like retail, construction and manufacturing.
The actions of the young are self-perpetuating. Young people are reluctant to set off on their own until they have greater financial stability. But the economic conditions necessary to make them financially secure are difficult to achieve while consumers like them are still too nervous to start making big purchases, on housing or anything else.
Small indulgences are not totally out of the question, though.
''To be honest, for my first few real paychecks I've treated myself,'' said Ms. Romanelli, explaining that she has not yet begun her plan to salt away half of each paycheck. ''It's only the first month or two, after all.''
Some economists are optimistic that there is considerable pent-up demand for new homes because so many young adults are reluctantly staying with their parents. Several of Mr. Bouvier's friends, he said, are ''itching to get out.'' As soon as they find work, he says, they'll leave.
''Once we get a little bit of job growth, or even expectations of better job market, those households are going to start breaking apart pretty fast,'' said Mr. Zandi, of Moody's Analytics. Household formation probably won't lead the recovery, but once set into motion by other good economic news it can ''supercharge growth.'' He estimates that there is pent-up demand for close to 1.1 million new households, which is approximately equal to the number of excess vacant homes for sale and rent.
''If these pent-up households were to form, then the oversupply of housing would be largely absorbed and housing construction would quickly ramp up,'' he said.
Mr. Bouvier, now three years out of school, is hoping to move into his own house early next year, ideally a place that he can ''fix up and turn into good investment.'' He says he'll hire a construction crew to help with the renovations.
''You know, they really should have kept that tax incentive for first-time home buyers,'' he said. ''I'm creating jobs after all. I thought that was a good thing.''

GUATEMALA CITY -- Seventh floor: geeks, computer screens, embryonic businesses -- including one offering digital monsters from artists who worked on ''The Chronicles of Narnia'' film series.
Fifth floor: Milkn'Cookies, a more established company with 50 employees and an online game that teaches children how to recycle.
All the floors combined? Guatemala's attempt to create a local Silicon Valley. 
For now, it is just a single brick building called Campus Tecnologico, with workspaces, programming classes and eco-friendly signs asking people to turn off lights in unused bathrooms. But the developers' goal is to turn this five- or six-block area in the city's center into an entrepreneurial campus, and a residential outpost for the hip, savvy, successful and young.
''For people here, it's the same as in Silicon Valley,'' said Juan Mini, Campus Tec's founder, who returned to Guatemala after starting a successful Internet company in California called ZipRealty. ''What matters is your brain.''
A zone for meritocracy -- that alone would be an achievement in Guatemala. Since the first coffee boom that began around 1875, Guatemala's economy has been defined by wild swings, cronyism and wide income disparities, with ethnic and class divisions that have mostly kept the poor poor and the rich rich.
The current era of drug-fueled violence has added another challenge. Indeed, for all its left coast breeziness, Campus Tec is still a place that must be protected with shotgun-toting guards and biometric keypads that require approved thumbprints for entry. Even Mr. Mini admits it is not exactly what venture capitalists from Palo Alto, Calif., like to see.
And yet, as an urban microprocessor -- a catalyst for change -- Campus Tec is showing signs of promise. After about a year of operation, neighbors say it is already stirring a small revival in a district called 4 Grados that has had its ups and downs.
A San Francisco-style apartment building a few blocks away, with glass-fronted lofts (built by Mr. Mini's cousin), recently filled up, selling out faster than many expected.
Certainly the young people in skinny jeans and too-tight plaid button-downs walking around at lunchtime on a recent afternoon were a welcome sight for business owners like Patricia Laparra, 43.
The owner of a designer glasses boutique near Campus Tec's main entrance, Ms. Laparra was one of many surprised by Campus Tec's impact. October was her second best month for sales since opening seven years ago. After a time when she thought she would have to close, she now says she has no plans to leave.
''They're geeks,'' she said, referring to Campus Tec's 375 inhabitants. ''They care about style. They're cool.''
Many of the companies inside, under exposed air ducts meant to signify Important Creative Work, were founded by Guatemalans with foreign experience. The motion graphics start-up on the seventh floor, BigoMo, consisted of two people: one, Pedro Mendez, 28, had worked in Spain; the other, Kristoffer Hormander, 25, recently returned from three years at Full Sail University outside Orlando, Fla.
Both said that they came back to Guatemala because they felt there were more opportunities for creativity, and less competition for business. One recent independent report, from The Global Entrepreneurship Monitor, found that the average cost to start a business in Guatemala is only $7,569, compared with $17,513 in Brazil and $39,670 in Costa Rica.
Technology in particular, Mr. Mendez said, offers a new path to success, a way for many young Guatemalans to overcome the usual social divides. ''There's a window of opportunity,'' added his partner, Mr. Hormander.
Other company founders agreed. At Milkn'Cookies, Wendy Beatriz Ruiz Cofino, 38, praised Campus Tec for showing that local entrepreneurs could come together, and grow. As the motto on her company chalkboard put it, in almost perfect English: ''keeping together is a progress.''
And profits are not necessarily the only measure of success. Since the peace accords of 1996 ended decades of war in Guatemala, many entrepreneurs have been focusing on the union of technology and social policy, creating things like affordable water filters, or a program for distributing health information to cellphones.
Campus Tec has a taste of this as well. Tech4Mobile, a company on the other side of a grassy patio from Mr. Mendez and Mr. Hormander, recently built a computerized system to record votes in the Guatemalan Congress. Before the government installed the software, votes were rarely recorded.
Maria Mercedes Zaghi, the business development coordinator for Campus Tec, said that she hoped to recruit more companies with a similar focus. But for now, Campus Tec is full with a waiting list. That is partly why there are plans to add another building, with three times as much space.
''We need to make it bigger,'' said Mr. Mini, who combines a family history in real estate with an M.B.A. from the University of California, Berkeley. ''It needs critical mass.''
But to get to that point, a final element is needed: financing. Apparently the Silicon Valley concept still requires Silicon Valley money.
Mr. Mini acknowledged that this would be the next significant challenge. Guatemala, after all, is still a place where progress can be upended by risk.
Just a few years ago, the 4 Grados area experienced a different kind of boom, with restaurants offering wine and middle-class families flocking to the cobblestone streets. Then the drunks and drug dealers came, the restaurants closed and the customers disappeared, residents said. Can Campus Tec and its geeks break the pattern? Mr. Mini sounded cautiously optimistic.
''I honestly think a new Guatemala is being born right now,'' he said. ''But,'' he added, ''it's going to take time.''

HEADLINE: Feuding Hurts G.O.P.'s Hopes To Win Senate

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- In a chamber of ample egos and matching oratory, Senator Bob Casey, the Pennsylvania Democrat, is understatement defined, his excitement most often registered by some extra eyebrow activity.
His low-radar personality, combined with exceedingly high unemployment and a dim view of President Obama back in his home state, make Mr. Casey -- and many other Democrats in the Senate up for re-election next year -- a perfect target for Republicans.
But like a number of his fellow Democrats whose fates could determine whether they lose control of the Senate, Mr. Casey's best asset may be his competition -- in his case, a field of nearly a dozen Republicans, many of them unknown or divisive within their own party.
Among his most prominent potential Republican challengers is Steve Welch, a deep-pocketed entrepreneur from Chester County who in 2008 switched his registration to Democratic in protest against his own party and voted for Mr. Obama in the primary that year. 
In a number of states where Republicans have been hopeful of picking up a seat, they are being hampered by some of the same dynamics that vexed their party in 2008, including trouble recruiting strong and experienced candidates, intraparty fighting, weak fund-raising and the very same anti-incumbent sentiment that also threatens Democrats.
Winning the Senate is tantalizingly within reach for Republicans, who have just 10 seats up for re-election, compared with the 23 that Democrats will defend next year, many of them in states where Democrats barely won in strong years for their party. Powerful national political trends continue to favor Republicans, especially in a weak economy.
But on a state by state basis, there are factors that give the Democrats hope and the Republicans pause. In states like Nebraska, tensions between the Tea Party movement and so-called establishment factions of the party threaten to roil the base. Florida and Pennsylvania have muddled Republican primary fields, with multiple candidates and no real standouts.
In Michigan, where Republicans hope the ailing economy is its own case against Senator Debbie Stabenow, one Republican primary candidate, former Representative Peter Hoekstra, proved to be an underwhelming statewide candidate in a previous campaign for governor, and another, Clark Durant, is an untested charter school executive.
The story is similar in Ohio, where Josh Mandel, the state treasurer, a Marine Corps veteran and fund-raising powerhouse, is somewhat disadvantaged in his race against the incumbent Democrat, Senator Sherrod Brown, by the fact the he looks too young to shave, several party officials acknowledged.
In Montana, Senator Jon Tester, the Democratic incumbent, is giving the Republican candidate, Representative Denny Rehberg, a spirited fight. Even in Missouri, where Senator Claire McCaskill is the Democratic equivalent of the state's flathead catfish -- perpetually in open season -- a group of Republican challengers have faced a series of setbacks, including fund-raising problems, and the state's most popular Republicans declined to jump in the pool.
''What we learned from 2010 is primaries matter,'' said Nathan L. Gonzales, an editor at The Rothenberg Political Report, a nonpartisan newsletter. ''Who Republicans nominate can dramatically affect the outcome of an election. Harry Reid was the best example of this; people didn't like him, didn't like the job he was doing, didn't like the direction of the country and they elected him because they didn't like the alternative,'' Mr. Gonzales said.
Of 33 Senate races next year, an analysis by The New York Times finds that 15 of them are currently competitive. The analysis, which is based on an evaluation of the candidates, polling and fund-raising results and the political and economic trends in the states, rates eight of them -- Hawaii, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Virginia, Wisconsin, Massachusetts and Nevada -- as tossups. Florida, Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania and New Mexico are rated as lean Democratic, while Arizona and North Dakota are rated lean Republican.
On balance, Republicans enter the 2012 Senate races with a solid chance of reversing the 53-47 advantage held by Democrats, which includes two independents who caucus with Democrats.
Democrats are largely playing defense, except in Massachusetts, where Elizabeth Warren is raising considerable amounts of money in the Democratic effort to unseat the original Tea Party upstart, Senator Scott P. Brown, and in Nevada, where each party's candidate is a member of the House but where voter registration favors the Democrat.
But Republicans have some concerns even in states that heavily favor them, including North Dakota, and Democrats are investing heavily in places like Nebraska, even though Senator Ben Nelson's voting record often has the Democratic majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, pulling at his gray tufts of hair.
The biggest fear among Republicans is of divisive primaries in which Tea Party-backed candidates prevail in states where they cannot win the general election, as happened in 2010 in Delaware, Colorado and Nevada, or that weaken the preferred candidate in the process.
In Nebraska, Senator Jim DeMint, the South Carolina Republican who is influential among conservatives nationwide, has endorsed Don Stenberg in the race to unseat Mr. Nelson, a Democrat. Mr. Stenberg is a conservative underdog whose fund-raising has badly trailed that of Attorney General Jon Bruning, the frontrunner in that primary.
In 2010, Mr. DeMint similarly promoted the insurgent conservative candidacy in Colorado of Ken Buck, helping propel Mr. Buck to the nomination but allowing the Democrat, Senator Michael Bennet, to argue that Mr. Buck was too far right.
Fears of ideologically divisive primaries often keep the best candidates from running, some Republican officials said.
''We are having trouble recruiting,'' said Martha Breene, the chairwoman of the Venango County Republican party in Pennsylvania. ''You often are not getting what you hope you could be getting, and then there is the Tea Party factor. A lot of them have good intent but it is sort of like they are the police men of all things and they aren't going to let other Republicans matter.''
In Pennsylvania, even Mr. Welch is trying to attract grassroots Republican activists to his campaign. ''I have a background that is similar to a lot of people in the Tea Party,'' he said. ''Historically I was not very engaged in politics and I am a limited government person.'' (Mr. Welch co-founded a company that assists developing businesses and briefly ran for the House in 2010.)
It was a scene that Representative Patrick Meehan, a Republican who party leaders had hoped would enter the race, has decided he can live without. ''Sometimes the challenges are ones of the moment,'' he said, explaining that he needed to serve his district. ''We'll see what emerges. It's still not too late for anyone else to get in.''
Correction: November 18, 2011, Friday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Thursday about Republican efforts to gain Senate seats in the 2012 elections described incorrectly the Senate candidates in Nevada, a tossup state. The Republican candidate, Dean Heller, is a former House member who was appointed to the Senate earlier this year; his opponent is Representative Shelley Berkley. Both candidates are not currently serving in the House.
Correction: November 18, 2011, Friday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: And a map with the article mislabeled, in some editions, the state in the upper left corner of the contiguous United States that is considered solidly Democratic. It is Washington, not Oregon. (Though the outcome of some races may be in doubt, one thing is for certain: Oregon will always be solidly under Washington.)

HEADLINE: A Fast Turn For Versace

BYLINE: By ERIC WILSON

 BODY:
THE Versace for H&M collection, which goes on sale in Europe today and in the United States on Saturday, has already generated enough buzz that it can qualify as a success for the designer Donatella Versace, even if she doesn't sell a single hot-pink suit. Not that that's likely, given the track record of such collaborations and the hype they create. Here, excerpts from a Q&A with Ms. Versace.
Q. Why was this the right moment for you to create a fast-fashion collection? 
A. It was because of all the young people who have decided to wear Versace vintage. Lady Gaga, for instance. And there is also a lot of homage to Versace happening in fashion. It is a very attractive homage, but this is the real Versace, and I think they should wear the real one. This is fashion right now. It's not about being the same. It's not about being safe. It's about daring, and it's about making people dream, too. There are not many things to dream about in the world right now, but fashion is one of them.
Q. You have described the collection as the greatest hits of Versace. How did you decide which moments to highlight?
A. There are clothes from each collection, since the beginning of the 1990s, that I still have in my closet and wear today. Some of them look so contemporary right now. That Miami print came from a moment when Miami was really happening, all the photographers were going there to do pictures, and all the actresses and the musicians were there. I wanted to underline those moments, but this is not a museum.
Q. Do you have any habits or rituals that are personal to you when you design? Do you do anything for good luck?
A. I don't think too much about it. Things come suddenly, when I am watching a movie, when I talk to my friends, or when I talk to my son or my daughter on the phone. When people tell me about a new thing, I say send it to me. And music has always been an inspiration for me. I like to listen to music very, very loud when I work.
Q. What is the least expensive thing that you have ever bought and actually worn?
A. Lipstick from a drugstore. It was $1.99.
Q. Most of the online commentary about the collection has been positive, but there has also been some snark. One commenter wrote, ''I don't think even the world's gayest gay could pull off that hot-pink suit.'' How do you react to that? Who do you think your clothes are for?
A. I could not even comprehend this in our day and age. It is a very homophobic comment, and I am surprised. Regardless, the suit also comes in black if pink is not his color.
Q. Did it ever cross your mind to water it down a bit?
A. Not a word I understand. I've never used that word in my life.
Q. Your brand represents an embrace of excess, and yet we are at a moment when conspicuous consumption and the disparity of wealth is a touchy subject. Have you been following the Occupy Wall Street protests?
A. It is not only in America. In Milan, everyone is in front of the Sforza. It looks much bigger on TV. I went to see it, and it is much smaller in real life, but it is very important to go there and listen to the voices. Something has to change in the world. Without change, young people will have no future.
Q. Well, what does that mean for the future of selling clothes?
A. You need to put something on, or you are naked. The thing that was wrong, when the depression came in 2008, was that many people said let's do safe clothes, because the economy is down and people are going to invest in things they can wear over and over again. Nothing can be more wrong than that. Fashion stands for new, glamorous, daring and sophisticated. The thing about H&M that makes me very happy is that I can reach an enormous crowd of young people, because they are looking for inspiration. They are not looking for a dress.

HEADLINE: Accenture Calls on Clients To Help Make A Statement

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
THE Chinese have the year of the tiger. Accenture has life after Tiger.
Of all the marketers that were using Tiger Woods as an endorser in 2009, Accenture may have had to scramble the most when disclosures about his personal life suddenly started to tarnish his pristine image. Accenture's campaigns had been centered on Mr. Woods for six years, first with the slogan ''Go on. Be a Tiger'' and later with ''We know what it takes to be a Tiger.''
After Accenture cut its ties to Mr. Woods in December 2009, its ads have featured photographs of animals -- giraffes, sheep, elephants and polar bears, but never tigers -- as metaphors to bring to life the Accenture brand theme of ''High performance. Delivered.'' For instance, one ad, depicting a polar bear with a fish encased in a block of ice, carries the headline ''Opportunity doesn't always arrive gift wrapped.'' 
As striking as those ads have been, they seem generic. The polar bear ad, at first glance, might have been taken for a pitch from Coca-Cola.
Now, Accenture is seeking to distinguish itself in a crowded category for consulting and other business services -- and move farther away from the Woods era -- with a campaign, scheduled to begin on Thursday, that features several prominent blue-chip clients like Marriott, the Royal Shakespeare Company, Unilever and New York City, for the 311 information hot line.
The campaign also gives greater prominence to the ''High performance. Delivered'' theme as well as the > symbol, which means ''more than,'' that appears above the ''t'' in the Accenture name.
The campaign further distances Accenture from the past in that it is the first to be produced by its new creative agency, TBWA/Chiat/Day in New York, part of the TBWA Worldwide division of the Omnicom Group.
TBWA/Chiat/Day was hired in June after Accenture, formerly known as Andersen Consulting, ended a 22-year association with Y&R in New York, part of the Young & Rubicam Brands unit of WPP. Accenture also hired another agency, Tag Worldwide, for global production of the campaign.
The campaign, which has an annual budget estimated at $65 million to $70 million, will include print ads, posters in 73 airports in 35 countries, outdoor ads, digital ads, social media and video clips of case studies that can be watched on accenture.com and YouTube. Images from the ads will also be displayed in 200 Accenture offices around the world.
''We are on a journey with our brand,'' said Pierre Nanterme, chief executive of Accenture, who described the animal ads as working well ''in building awareness'' for the company.
''We're moving to the next phase,'' he added, ''and the objective is very clear: to reinforce our differentiation, creating more distance between us and our competitors.''
The new campaign does that by ''emphasizing much more what we do for our clients,'' Mr. Nanterme said. ''It's not only who we are, but what we do.''
Previous ads for Accenture had talked about clients, said Mark Figliulo, chairman and chief creative officer at TBWA/Chiat/Day New York, ''but they were not at the center of the ads as they are now.''
For instance, the print ads featuring Unilever describe how Accenture helped Unilever executives ''with an unprecedented effort to simplify, standardize and unify their business processes worldwide,'' achieving ''over 1 billion euros in savings'' so far.
Unilever ''chose Accenture as a core partner to work with us on a number of projects'' from 2005 through 2011, said Willem Eelman, chief information officer at Unilever in London. ''We've not always been the easiest client, but at the end we're both quite proud of what we've achieved.''
When Accenture asked to include Unilever in the campaign, ''there was a little bit of reservation'' initially, Mr. Eelman said, but the approval came because ''Accenture has been a partner in this journey with us.''
The Unilever ads illustrate the sense of humor that permeates the campaign. The ads depict a young woman with long, flyaway hair, presumably the beneficiary of a Unilever hair-care brand; the headline proclaims that Accenture delivered the billion-euro savings for Unilever ''without any tangles.''
The ads using the Royal Shakespeare Company discuss how Accenture's analytics ''increased attendance by 30 percent with 0 percent toil and trouble.'' Other ads, which carry the headline ''In today's global economy the world is being remade each and every day,'' wink at readers with their setting: a globe factory.
The humorous tack and ''bold colors'' for the ads ''really do differentiate us,'' said Roxanne Taylor, chief marketing and communications officer at Accenture, not only from competitors but also from other marketers that use client testimonials in campaigns. (Examples include Adobe Systems, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, I.B.M., Unum and Xerox.)
''The ads are not generic people in conference rooms with rolled-up sleeves,'' Mr. Figliulo said, adding that Accenture executives ''explicitly said they did not want that.''
Accenture's association with Mr. Woods may have dented its own image a bit, according to the annual Interbrand Best Global Brands Report, which showed the value of the Accenture brand declining in 2009 to $7.7 billion, from $7.9 billion in 2008, and declining again in 2010, to $7.5 billion. But in the 2011 report, the value rose to $8 billion, a high.
Accenture retains a sense of humor about its past with Mr. Woods. Asked about the animals that have appeared in the ads the last two years, Ms. Taylor said, smiling, ''We definitely left tigers out.''
Although Mr. Woods lost many endorsement contracts -- examples in addition to Accenture included AT&T, Gatorade and Tag Heuer -- companies like Nike did not cut ties with him. And he was recently signed as a spokesman for Rolex and a sports nutrition company, Fuse Science.

HEADLINE: Widening Split in Europe On the Virtue of Austerity

BYLINE: By LIZ ALDERMAN and GRAHAM BOWLEY; Liz Alderman reported from Paris and Graham Bowley from New York.

 BODY:
PARIS -- Throughout Europe's long debt crisis, Germany has prescribed the same strong remedy to its troubled neighbors: a stiff dose of fiscal discipline.
As long as the patients were southern European countries like Greece and Italy, seen as victims of an unhealthy lifestyle, northern-tier nations like France, Austria and the Netherlands have been willing to go along with Germany's prescriptions for reducing debt in the name of economic health. And they were willing to support Germany's insistence that the European Central Bank not be a lender of last resort to indebted governments by actively buying their bonds.
But suddenly, as investors' fears mount that many euro area nations are about to tip into recession, even countries like creditworthy France are finding it much more expensive to borrow money in the open market. And with that development comes a dawning realization: that austerity, rather than making it easier for them to pay down their higher debts, could make it harder -- and more expensive. 
The exposure of the United States, and in particular its banks, to Europe's debt problems caused a sharp sell-off in stocks Wednesday in the final two hours of trading. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, flat on the day by about 2 p.m., lost 20.9 points, or 1.66 percent, to close at 1,236.91, after the rating agency Fitch warned that United States banks were vulnerable if Europe did not solve its crisis quickly.
As investors worried about the European sovereign debt held by banks and their vulnerability to stress in the European financial system, bank shares led the declines. Goldman Sachs lost 4 percent to $95.50. Morgan Stanley closed down 8 percent at $14.66. Citigroup lost about 4 percent to $26.90.
''All this underscores the ongoing nervousness about Europe generally and the banking sector specifically,'' said Barry Knapp, head of American equity strategy at Barclays Capital.
In Europe, as France's borrowing costs become increasingly divergent from Germany's, so might its attitude toward having the European Central Bank step in. Already, French officials are openly disagreeing with Germany on the policy.
On Wednesday, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany continued to speak out against the idea of the central bank buying bonds, while the French finance minister, Francois Baroin, was arguing just the opposite.
Mr. Baroin called for the support of all European institutions, including the central bank, to respond to the crisis. ''But Germany, for historic reasons, has closed the door to the direct involvement of the E.C.B.,'' Mr. Baroin said in an interview with the French business newspaper Les Echos.
Mr. Baroin's remark was a reference to Germany's deep-seated fears over the inflation that could result if the central bank pumped more money into the region's economies.
The so-called yield gap -- the premium that investors demand for holding French 10-year government bonds, rather than German ones -- rose Wednesday to a new high since the euro began of nearly two percentage points. It later eased back somewhat, to 1.9 percentage points.
That is still not close to the yield gap of nearly 5.2 percentage points that beleaguered Italy has with Germany, but it is a disturbing new trend for France. Austria and Netherlands are also experiencing widening yield gaps with Germany, and Spain has become a new source for concern.
The central bank was more aggressively in the market buying the bonds of Italy and Spain on Wednesday to stabilize the situation, traders said. It bought about 146 million euros, more than the 28 million euros it had bought over the previous two days, according to TD Securities. That helped lower yields earlier, but the effect didn't last and interest rates rose again later.
In Spain, which holds elections this weekend, the 10-year yield rose to 6.4 percent -- up from 5 percent just five weeks ago, and back to the levels that first prompted the central bank to begin its current relatively low-level bond buying program in the summer.
In its warning, Fitch said United States banks ''could be greatly affected if contagion continues to spread beyond the stressed European markets.'' The banks' exposure to European countries' debt and to European banks was ''sizable'' then ''unless the euro zone debt crisis is resolved in a timely and orderly manner, the broad outlook for U.S. banks will darken.''
Another agency, Moody's, downgraded several German lenders, adding to investors' jitters.
Italy continues to be a major source of bond market worries, despite the announcement Wednesday by its new prime minister, Mario Monti, of a new cabinet stocked with academics and people from the banking industry and the upper reaches of the civil service.
Italian 10-year yields were back to nearly 7 percent, the level at which analysts say financing the country's 1.8 trillion euro ($2.4 trillion ) debt mountain becomes unsustainable.
But the market anxiety has moved well beyond Italy, as the specter of a regionwide recession is making investors realize that if every country is tightening its belt at the same time, few will be able to grow their way out of the problems any time soon.
So far, France, the Netherlands and Austria have been among Germany's allies in the crisis. France, eager to show that the French-German axis is thriving, has even backed Germany's stance on central bank lending. The question now, though, is whether other countries will start to resist Germany's policy prescriptions.
''The Germans have been able to rely on the French, the Dutch and the Austrians,'' said Simon Tilford, the chief economist at the Center for European Reform in London. ''But if they get dragged into this and their borrowing costs continue to rise, that could influence whether they continue to back Germany and the line taken on the euro zone crisis.''
On Wednesday, the French government showed a clear sign of divergence. It called on the central bank to help calm the crisis by buying the bonds of Italy, Greece and other governments whose borrowing costs are surging.
''The E.C.B.'s role is to ensure the stability of the euro, but also the financial stability of Europe,'' said Valerie Pecresse, the French budget minister.
Mr. Baroin, the French finance minister, went further, alluding to the German fear of inflation, which many historians say helped Hitler's rise to power. Indeed, much of Germany's response to the current economic crisis is rooted in a desire not to let history repeat itself.
Mr. Baroin said that the United States Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan had intervened in their bond markets with little fear that they were being influenced politically. ''But Germany has a history, a memory about inflation and overindebtedness,'' he said.
The central bank is also being sought out by banks that are desperate for cheap financing to offset losses. The chief executive of UniCredit, one of Italy's largest lenders, urged the European Central Bank to increase access to central bank borrowing for Italian banks, the Italian press reported.
Berlin fears that allowing countries to rely on the central bank as a white knight would make them lazy about fixing their own finances. On Monday, Jens Weidmann, president of the German Bundesbank and an influential member of the European Central Bank's governing council, said it would be illegal to use the bank to solve government budget problems.
''The increasing demand being placed on monetary policy is dangerous,'' Mr. Weidmann said. ''Monetary policy cannot and may not solve the solvency problems of governments and banks.''
Analysts, though, say the time for insisting on ideology is quickly running out. Because European policy makers still have not started up the main bailout fund for Europe -- the European Financial Stability Facility -- there are virtually no other tools besides austerity to whittle down debts and deficits.
But, said Mr. Tilford, the euro zone ''is going to crack unless E.C.B. enters the picture soon.'' If the central bank really starts carrying out the lender of last resort function, then the crisis can still be reined in, he and others said.
The question is whether the central bank is engaging in a strategy of brinkmanship to extract as many reforms from governments before it intervenes, or whether it genuinely intends to resist pressure to be a lender of last resort.
''If it's a game of chicken, then it's a very risky one,'' said Mr. Tilford. ''If they are resisting becoming a lender of last resort, then the future of the euro zone is very much in doubt.''

HEADLINE: A Marriage Of Economic Convenience

BYLINE: By ERIC WILSON

 BODY:
THE scene on Nov. 8 at a shopping party to preview the new Versace for H&M collection was fairly predictable, if you didn't count the midnight concert by Prince. When the racks of gold-studded dresses and tropical-print shirts were finally unveiled, in a temporary store on a Hudson River pier, the invited fashion editors, celebrities and Nicki Minaj quickly picked them clean. ''Many of the women in the crowd made beelines for the collection's men's clothes,'' Style.com said. There was still a line outside the shop at 2:30 a.m.
More than a decade since Target first popularized collaborations between high-end designers and mass retailers, and seven years since H&M introduced a collection with Karl Lagerfeld, there is still allure in the concept of cheap and chic. 
Based on news media coverage to date, there is every reason to expect huge crowds and long lines when the Versace clothes go on sale Thursday at international H&M stores (Donatella Versace is to attend the opening in London) and Saturday in the United States. Items from the collection like a cropped baseball jacket with vivid leopard-spotted sleeves, for $129, will undoubtedly sell out, and many of them will then likely reappear on eBay at a higher price. (Actually, that jacket is already there, with an asking price of $179.99.)
Despite concerns that the commonplace appearance of designer names at stores like Macy's, Kohl's, Wal-Mart and even Payless ShoeSource would eventually lead to shopper fatigue, such collaborations are proving to be both a reliable business model for retailers and a business in themselves.
And designers, even those who have far less name recognition than Ms. Versace, are finding these collaborations to be increasingly lucrative. While few details about financial relationships have ever been made public, the typical fees paid to designers have generally more than doubled over the last five years, according to several participants in recent deals, though each seems to follow its own rules.
Mr. Lagerfeld and Stella McCartney, who designed an H&M collection in 2005, were each reportedly paid $1 million for their services; and Madonna, whose M by Madonna collection was sold there in 2007, was said to have received $4 million. (Billboard reported in 2007 that sales of Madonna's collection, which was broader than most, reached $20 million.)
Ms. Versace's payment is expected to be closer to that of the other designers, according to company executives, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the terms were confidential. But Ms. Versace's deal is based on a percentage of sales. It also includes a higher financial commitment from H&M for advertising and promotions. A spokeswoman for H&M said the company would not comment on any sales or compensation figures for the collaborations.
Marc Beckman, a founder of Designers Management Agency, a talent agency that has worked with labels like Proenza Schouler, Derek Lam, Christian Siriano and Sophie Theallet, said that deals with the biggest players in the fast-fashion sector now typically include cash payments of over $1 million. In 2007, many of those payments, particularly for Target's Go International program for emerging designers, were reported to be around $250,000. Mr. Beckman negotiated a long-term contract for a Jay Manuel collection at Sears Canada, connected Rachel Roy with Amar'e Stoudemire for a collaboration and paired the handbag designer Monica Botkier with Swatch.
''The deals we have done, as long as they are for designers at the high end, are seven digits, and at the low end they are six digits,'' Mr. Beckman said.
While the mechanics of such collaborations have become more sophisticated, just how they work has remained somewhat mysterious to shoppers, who may not realize that sales of Ms. Versace's collection for H&M, or the wildly popular Missoni line that was sold at Target this fall, will barely have an effect on the retailers' overall sales volumes. In fact, their success is not measured in dollars, but in overall media impressions, the metric used to determine how many times consumers read or saw a mention of the collaboration in the news media. The Missoni for Target collection, for instance, was covered in the September issues of more than 40 magazines and amassed impressions in the billions.
Looking at Target's Go International and Designer Collaborations programs, during which new designers were introduced at the store in the last five years, the most successful, by one measure, was Alexander McQueen in 2009. A year before his death, the designer, through his lower-priced McQ label, made a small collection for Target that received mixed reviews from fashion critics, and was flat in comparison to those of Proenza Schouler in 2007 or Rodarte, which was introduced later in 2009. But it nevertheless created a lot of buzz for the store.
Right Angle Research, a luxury-goods market research company based in New Rochelle, N.Y., estimated that editorial coverage of that McQueen collection in crucial American magazines was worth $2.1 million to Target for the time period it was in stores. That figure is based partly on the cost of comparable ad space in those magazines, but also considers other factors like the prominence of placement on a page.
Judging long-term effects of collaborations is complicated by how much mass communication has changed. Larry Hotz, the president of Right Angle, said that the Lagerfeld line arrived before the retailer had an online presence, and still, he said, ''it was very significant in terms of the press it did generate at the time.'' By comparison, the Versace collection has been so exhaustively promoted, with the elaborate fashion show and in social media and videos, that it has been unavoidable on fashion blogs the last two weeks.
For smaller designers, it is not just about the exposure. The income can finance a runway show, or help sustain a high-end collection.
Mr. Siriano, who started his signature collection after winning ''Project Runway'' in 2008, has since designed accessories for LG, makeup for Victoria's Secret, a capsule collection for Spiegel and a sponge for O-Cel-O. (''Don't judge me,'' he said. ''It was funny and hilarious.'') His most lucrative collaboration has been with Payless, which sponsors his fashion shows and, as a result of an expanded contract signed last year, pays a royalty for every pair of shoes sold. ''Not only is it financially great for me, but there were a lot of customers who couldn't afford a $3,000 dress,'' he said.
Payless plans to have at least a couple of central styles of Mr. Siriano's shoes in most of its 4,000-plus stores next spring, said LuAnn Via, its chief executive. Customers now see Mr. Siriano like a national brand, she said, so Payless wants to consistently offer new product from him.
''A one-time hype is not going to bring a long-lasting halo to your brand,'' Ms. Via said.
While attention now is focused on the Versace collection, which will be in H&M stores for only a short time, there is more interest among designers, and deal-makers, for longer partnerships. It may not have happened yet, but there is always a fear that at some point, the buzz will fade.
Target, which introduced its first fashion collaboration in 2000, with Mossimo, and followed with Isaac Mizrahi in 2003, raised its cool factor by luring younger, hipper designers, and the company reportedly paid handsomely to attract some of the coolest early on. Proenza Schouler's contract, according to executives familiar with the deal, approached seven figures, but its Target collaboration inspired other young designers to break the traditional industry taboo of crossing over into mass.
And the exposure helped some critical darlings who have no real backing, like Kate and Laura Mulleavy of Rodarte, to maintain the impression they are bigger than they really are. The strategy appears to have paid off for Target, though the collaboration has not been without its bumps, as when Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez of Proenza Schouler accused the retailer of knocking off their signature bag this spring. (Target also does not discuss specifics about relationships with designers.)
Predicting just how big or successful each designer rollout is going to be is part art and part science, said Trish Adams, the senior vice president for apparel and accessories at Target. Executives take into account the historic performance of other lines, how the name is perceived among its customers and even the price differential between the designer merchandise and what will be sold at Target. Still, demand for the Missoni clothes and home designs exceeded expectations, leaving some customers disappointed when many products were not available.
But the company wants its collaborations to maintain a sense of the unexpected. On Sunday, Target introduced children's clothes designed by Gwen Stefani, called Harajuku Mini for Target, that will have an ongoing presence in the store. Ms. Stefani said she found it appealing that Target gave her no creative restrictions beyond what was required to maintain safety standards. ''I love the idea they are letting me do punker pants for kids,'' she said. ''We're going to be doing swimsuits next.''
Among its guest designers for the holiday season is Josie Natori, who is creating two intimate-apparel collections, one now in stores for Christmas shopping and a second for Valentine's Day. The reasoning was simple: Half of Target's sales in the intimate apparel category happen in that period.
''A lot of it comes down to what is the business objective, is it right for us, and is it right for the designer,'' Ms. Adams said.
To hear it from designers, these collaborations offer a fast infusion of cash while helping to expand their awareness and making them seem almost populist in the eyes of many consumers. In the early days of fast fashion, retailers needed a big name to entice consumers, but consumers are now much more aware of a broad spectrum of designer names. Perversely, selling clothes at Target has become a status symbol for up-and-coming designers.
''The model has changed in a way,'' said Gaby Basora of the Tucker label, who designed a collection for Target last year. ''It used to be that you went mass toward the end of your career. Now it's more of a legitimizing moment for younger bands.''

HEADLINE: 2 Elements Of Jobs Bill Pass House Unanimously

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The House on Wednesday approved a measure that would repeal a tax-withholding requirement on government contractors and provide tax incentives for companies that hire veterans, sending President Obama the first, relatively modest components of his jobs bill for his signature. 
''Veterans of every working-age generation are finding themselves unemployed or seriously underemployed due to the economic downturn,'' Representative Jeff Miller, Republican of Florida and chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, said in support of the bill, which passed. 422 to 0, under a fast-tracked process on the House floor.
The vote followed overwhelming Senate approval and represented a rare bipartisan consensus on elements in the package assembled by the White House in its effort to spur hiring. Republicans have rejected or blocked other pieces of the legislation, including proposals for capital works and money for the hiring of emergency workers and public school teachers.
After the vote, the president said in a statement that he wanted to ''congratulate Republicans and Democrats in Congress for coming together to pass these tax credits that will encourage businesses to hire America's veterans. No veteran who fought for our country should have to fight for a job when they come home.''
He also said approval of the measure was a ''only a step. Congress needs to pass the rest of my American Jobs Act so that we can create jobs and put money in the pockets of the middle class.''
At the same time, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, urged the president to hold a public signing ceremony of the legislation to illustrate the bipartisan nature of the bill -- a challenge to the president to share some of the credit with Republicans.
The withholding provision -- passed as part of a larger tax bill under the Bush administration with strong Republican support but delayed for various reasons until 2013 -- repealed the requirement that federal, state and local agencies withhold 3 percent of certain payments to companies doing business with the government. Its proponents say it could encourage those who do business with the government to hire more workers. The Congressional Budget Office said its repeal would reduce federal revenues by $11 billion over 10 years.
To pay for it, the bill fixes an apparent error in the health care law that would allow hundreds of thousands of middle-income early retirees to get nearly free Medicaid coverage meant for the poor. Representative Eric Cantor, the majority leader, said the bill ''removes the threat of unnecessary costs to allow small businesses, universities and manufacturers to put their capital towards expanding and creating jobs.''

HEADLINE: Majority Leader Gives Deficit Panel Wide Berth

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER and ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the powerful House majority leader, enjoys expressing his views. He travels frequently around the country selling the House Republican agenda, makes flattering YouTube videos, holds lengthy weekly news conferences and is a regular on the talk show circuit.
But when it comes to weighing in on a new Republican deficit reduction proposal that includes tax increases, Mr. Cantor has been notably silent. 
''I'm not going to opine as to suggestions, hypotheticals, reports about workings in the committee,'' Mr. Cantor said in a meeting with reporters this week. ''I want them to do their work. I think they are perfectly capable of doing it without added pressure from the outside.''
His spokeswoman said Wednesday that Mr. Cantor had still not reviewed the deficit reduction plan, which was presented this week to Republicans by Representative Jeb Hensarling, a fiscal hawk from Texas who is serving as co-chairman of the bipartisan panel responsible for drawing up a plan.
Aides also said Mr. Cantor did not want to complicate the talks by making a judgment prematurely.
The plan, drafted by Senator Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania, one of the most conservative members of the Senate, includes $300 billion in new tax revenue over 10 years and a rewriting of the tax code. It has gotten a nod of approval from Speaker John A. Boehner, Mr. Hensarling and other top Congressional Republicans, but it or a similar proposal could represent a difficult choice for Mr. Cantor and fellow Republicans who have dug in deep this year against any proposal that resembles a tax increase.
This is just the most recent episode in which Mr. Cantor, who has been in the middle of contentious fiscal talks all year, has grown skittish when the specter of a compromise with Democrats looms.
This year, he walked away from negotiations with Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. over legislation to raise the debt ceiling. And he was icy concerning negotiations between Mr. Boehner and President Obama that collapsed when Mr. Boehner could find little support for an agreement that included new revenues from his leadership team, scuttling a plan that many budget experts believe was potentially the best fiscal compromise deal either party could reach.
Now, as other Republicans are bracing for the blowback from some members of their own party, led by the anti-tax activist Grover Norquist, over the slight opening to new revenues, Mr. Cantor has made the strategic decision to stay away for now from endorsing -- or deriding -- the Republican offer.
Further, as Congressional leaders from both parties have traipsed around the Capitol all week trying desperately to promote an agreement with a deadline just days away, Mr. Cantor has stayed largely out of the fray. During the early part of the week, he was occupied with a camera crew from ''60 Minutes'' that was chronicling his moves for a feature on him; this week his staff released the second of its office videos designed to soften the image of Mr. Cantor, who has been trailed by protesters as he has traveled the country promoting the House Republican economic agenda.
Mr. Cantor's staff points out that his weighing in now could tilt the deficit reduction process since he was an active participant in previous talks, and that he is sensitive to the pressures of serving on such a committee and does not want to add fuel to the fire.
Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the House Republican whip, has also not registered his views on Mr. Toomey's proposal.
The Treasury reported this week that, for the first time, the total federal debt exceeded $15 trillion -- up from $10.6 trillion when President Obama took office in 2009 and $5.7 trillion when President George W. Bush took office in 2001. Two-thirds of the current debt is held by the public; most of the rest is held by government trust funds.
In an effort to show that they had offered major concessions, Democrats disclosed on Wednesday that they were willing to accept a deficit reduction deal including much smaller tax increases than they had originally proposed.
Indeed, Democrats said they were willing to accept the overall numbers in the Toomey proposal: $776 billion over 10 years in spending cuts, including $275 billion of savings in health care programs, and $401 billion of new tax revenue.
''Democrats put forward a serious counteroffer to the Toomey proposal that meets Republicans dollar for dollar on spending and revenue, but demands fairness for the middle class and a plan to create jobs,'' a Democratic aide close to the committee said. ''There was a hope that it would close the gap, but that hope is fading as Republicans appear to be walking away entirely.''
The Republican proposal calls for savings of $75 billion in Medicare payments to health care providers; $150 billion from Medicare beneficiaries; $50 billion from Medicaid and other health programs; and $100 billion from other entitlement programs. It would save more than $160 billion over 10 years by reducing the annual cost-of-living adjustment in Social Security and other benefits.
Republicans said their proposal would raise $310 billion over 10 years from ''individual tax reform'' and $50 billion from ''corporate tax reform.'' Some of the new revenue results from anticipated economic growth.
Democrats said they had refused to accept any increase in the age of eligibility for Medicare, any reduction in the cost-of-living adjustment for Social Security or any extension of tax cuts for the most affluent 2 percent of households.
While Mr. Toomey's plan has almost zero chance of become the deficit panel's final offer to Congress -- Democrats have already written it off as a charade and do not like the idea of extending the Bush-era tax cuts for affluent Americans -- Mr. Cantor's blessing on any final deal is critical, especially on one that includes revenue increases as demanded by Democrats. The approval of Mr. Cantor, who often aligns himself with the most conservative factions of the House, could clear the way for others to support it. His opposition could greatly complicate its passage.
Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, the No. 3 Senate Republican, said Republicans would have to be more flexible on revenues if the nation's fiscal woes were to be addressed.
''This is about more than money,'' Mr. Alexander said. ''It's about whether the president and the Congress can competently govern.
''We now have Republicans who have put revenues on the table; we have Democrats on the supercommittee who have put entitlements on the table. Both need to put more on the table and get a result, and we're here to support them.''

HEADLINE: Sharp Decline in Revenue Is Forecast for California

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- California's budget problems show no signs of abating.
A report released by state budget analysts on Wednesday forecasts a sharp decline in revenue for this fiscal year, which could set off more than $2 billion in new cuts in state spending in January, including a seven-day reduction in the school year for public school students. 
The report by the Legislative Analyst's Office projected that the state would fall $3.7 billion short of the $88.5 billion in revenues and transfers that was anticipated in the 2011-12 state budget approved in June. Under the terms of that budget, automatic reductions -- known as trigger cuts, and specified in some detail in the budget -- go into effect if revenues fall $1 billion or more short of projections.
There is still one more step in this process to determine whether the cuts will occur. Next month, the Finance Department will offer its own analysis of revenues for the year; the final trigger cuts will be based on whichever revenue forecast is higher. But monthly revenue reports by the Finance Department have almost without exception reported drops in revenues this year.
''The budget the governor signed recognized that economic uncertainty could force the trigger cuts to take effect,'' said Ana J. Matosantos, the director of finance. ''Some level of trigger cuts will likely occur, but the exact amount will be known in December.''
The cuts could range from $600 million to over $2 billion, depending on the ultimate revenue shortfall. Under the budget, reductions would be forced in spending on higher education, child care, libraries, preschool programs and public schools.
The report sent a new wave of anxiety through state officials, who for years have had to impose deep cuts to deal with the state's continuing financial crisis.
Even in the midst of the sobering news, the report praised Gov. Jerry Brown and lawmakers for cutbacks earlier this year that began to address the state's problems.
''By making very difficult budgetary decisions -- including the trigger cuts -- the Legislature and the governor have strengthened the state's fiscal condition considerably,'' the report said. ''The Legislature now faces a much smaller budget problem than projected a year ago and the smallest projected out-year deficits since the 2007-2009 recession.''
But it said the problem had hardly been solved. Even with the cuts, Sacramento faces a shortfall of nearly $13 billion in next year's budget.
The Legislature and Mr. Brown dealt with the shortfall almost entirely by trimming spending after Republicans refused a request by Mr. Brown for a ballot initiative that would have allowed voters to extend taxes that were otherwise expiring. Mr. Brown has said he intends to try to propose a voter initiative next November to raise taxes, though he has not said which ones.
''California's budget gap is the result of a decade of poor fiscal choices and a global recession,'' said Gil Duran, Mr. Brown's press secretary. ''This year, we cut the problem in half. Next year, we'll continue to make the tough choices necessary until the problem is solved.''

HEADLINE: A Marine Base For Australia Irritates China

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES; Michael Wines contributed reporting from Beijing.

 BODY:
CANBERRA, Australia -- President Obama announced Wednesday that the United States planned to deploy 2,500 Marines in Australia to shore up alliances in Asia, but the move prompted a sharp response from Beijing, which accused Mr. Obama of escalating military tensions in the region.
The agreement with Australia amounts to the first long-term expansion of the American military's presence in the Pacific since the end of the Vietnam War. It comes despite budget cuts facing the Pentagon and an increasingly worried reaction from Chinese leaders, who have argued that the United States is seeking to encircle China militarily and economically.
''It may not be quite appropriate to intensify and expand military alliances and may not be in the interest of countries within this region,'' Liu Weimin, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, said in response to the announcement by Mr. Obama and Prime Minister Julia Gillard of Australia.
In an address to the Australian Parliament on Thursday morning, Mr. Obama said he had ''made a deliberate and strategic decision -- as a Pacific nation, the United States will play a larger and long-term role in shaping this region and its future.'' 
The president said the moves were not intended to isolate China, but they were an unmistakable sign that the United States had grown warier of its intentions.
China has invested heavily in military modernization and has begun to deploy long-range aircraft and a more able deep-sea naval force, and it has asserted territorial claims to disputed islands that would give it broad sway over oil and gas rights in the East and South China Seas.
While the new military commitment is relatively modest, Mr. Obama has promoted it as the cornerstone of a strategy to confront more directly the challenge posed by China's rapid advance as an economic and military power. He has also made some progress in creating a new Pacific free-trade zone that would give America's free-market allies in the region some trading privileges that do not immediately extend to China.
Mr. Obama described the deployment as responding to the wishes of democratic allies in the region, from Japan to India. Some allies have expressed concerns that the United States, facing war fatigue and a slackened economy, will cede its leadership role to China.
The president said budget-cutting in Washington -- and the inevitable squeeze on military spending -- would not inhibit his ability to follow through. Defense cuts ''will not -- I repeat, will not -- come at the expense of the Asia-Pacific,'' he said.
Some analysts in China and elsewhere say they fear that the moves could backfire, risking a cold war-style standoff with China.
''I don't think they're going to be very happy,'' said Mark Valencia, a Hawaii-based senior researcher at the National Bureau of Asian Research, who said the new policy was months in the making. ''I'm not optimistic in the long run as to how this is going to wind up.''
The president is to fly north across the continent to Darwin, a frontier port and military outpost across the Timor Sea from Indonesia, which will be the center of operations for the coming deployment. The first 200 to 250 Marines will arrive next year, with forces rotating in and out and eventually building up to 2,500, the two leaders said.
The United States will not build new bases on the continent, but will use Australian facilities instead. Mr. Obama said that Marines would rotate through for joint training and exercises with Australians, and the American Air Force would have increased access to airfields in the nation's Northern Territory.
''We're going to be in a position to more effectively strengthen the security of both of our nations and this region,'' he said.
The United States has had military bases and large forces in Japan and South Korea, in the north Pacific, since the end of World War II, but its presence in Southeast Asia was greatly diminished in the early 1990s with the closing of major bases in the Philippines, at Clark Field and Subic Bay. The new arrangement with Australia will restore a substantial American footprint near the South China Sea, a major commercial route -- including for American exports -- that has been roiled by China's disputed claims of control.
The United States and other Pacific Rim nations are also negotiating to create a free-trade bloc, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, that would not initially include China, the world's largest exporter and producer of manufactured goods.
The tentative trade agreement was a topic over the weekend in Honolulu, where Mr. Obama hosted the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, and it will be discussed again later this week when he becomes the first American president to participate in the East Asia Summit meeting, on the Indonesian island of Bali.
For China, the week's developments could suggest both an economic and a military encirclement. Top leaders did not immediately comment on Mr. Obama's speech, but Mr. Liu, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, emphasized that it was the United States, not China, seeking to use military power to influence events in Asia.
The Global Times, a state-run news organization known for its nationalist and bellicose commentaries, issued a stronger reaction in an editorial, saying that Australia should be cautious about allowing the United States to use bases there to ''harm China'' and that it risked getting ''caught in the cross-fire.''
Analysts say that Chinese leaders have been caught off guard by what they view as an American campaign to stir up discontent in the region. China may have miscalculated in recent years by restating longstanding territorial claims that would give it broad sway over development rights in the South China Sea, they say. But they argue that Beijing has not sought to project military power far beyond its shores, and has repeatedly proposed to resolve territorial disputes through negotiations.
The United States portrays itself as responding to a new Chinese assertiveness in the region that has alarmed core American allies. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton wrote a recent article in Foreign Policy laying out an expansive case for American involvement in Asia, and Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta characterized China's military development as lacking transparency and criticized its assertiveness in the regional waters.
Mr. Obama reached out to China even as he announced the new troop deployment. ''The notion that we fear China is mistaken; the notion that we are looking to exclude China is mistaken,'' he said.
The president said that China would be welcomed into the new trade pact if Beijing was willing to meet the free-trade standards for membership. But such standards would require China to let its currency rise in value, to better protect foreign producers' intellectual property rights and to limit or end subsidies to state-owned companies, all of which would require a major overhaul of China's economic development strategy.
Mr. Obama canceled two previous planned trips to Australia because of domestic demands; he recalled Wednesday at a state dinner that he had visited the country twice as a boy, when his mother was working in Indonesia on development programs.
This time, as president, Mr. Obama arrived at Parliament House to a 21-gun salute and, once inside, to the enthusiastic greeting of Australians crowding the galleries of the vast marble entrance hall.
The two countries have been allies for decades, and cooperated closely in World War II, when there were several dozen American air and naval bases and army camps in the country and Australian combat troops served under American command.
Another purpose of Mr. Obama's visit is to celebrate those ties. ''The United States has no stronger ally,'' Mr. Obama said.
Australians fought alongside Americans in every war of the 20th century, and more recently have served in Iraq and Afghanistan.
The war in Afghanistan has become increasingly unpopular here, though, and most Australians want their troops to come home immediately.

HEADLINE: Gingrich on the Defensive Over Hefty Freddie Mac Fees

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG and JEFF ZELENY; Trip Gabriel, Charles Duhigg and Kitty Bennett contributed reporting.

 BODY:
9:01 p.m. UpdatedFor roughly six years, Newt Gingrich worked closely with high-level officials at the government-sponsored mortgage company Freddie Mac. As a highly paid consultant, he coached them on how to win over the conservatives who consider their company an anathema, spoke to their political action committee and offered general advice as they worked to stave off various threats to Freddie Mac's survival, several people familiar with his role there said Tuesday.
The full extent of Mr. Gingrich's involvement with Freddie Mac burst into the open after Bloomberg News reported Tuesday that he earned $1.6 million to $1.8 million, in an on-and-off relationship from 1999 to 2008, with the mortgage company that has since been taken over by the federal government. The payments were far more than had previously been known, or than Mr. Gingrich, the former House speaker, had previously acknowledged. 
His compensation, which several former Freddie Mac officials confirmed in interviews on Tuesday, and the extent of his work with the mortgage company, presented Mr. Gingrich with a fresh challenge to his Republican bid for the presidency just as he was climbing in polls and gaining traction as a possible challenger to the party's presumed front-runner, Mitt Romney.
Not only is Freddie Mac a longtime conservative whipping post, but the extent of his consultancy for the mortgage giant seemed to be at odds with his own statements about his work there. He has also blamed it for the collapse of the housing market, saying that at least one Democratic supporter should be jailed, and, in 2008, that President Obama should give back any money his campaign received from its executives.
The news of the full extent of his Freddie Mac contract put him on the defensive all day.
''Fannie and Freddie, as you know, have been the epicenter of the financial meltdown in this country,'' said Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, while campaigning in Iowa. ''While he was taking that money, I was fighting against Fannie and Freddie.''
Speaking with reporters in Iowa on Wednesday, Mr. Gingrich played down the report, saying that he did not know exactly how much he was paid, and that Freddie Mac was but one company that enlisted his firm, the Gingrich Group.
''It's a multiyear project. It was paid to Gingrich Group. Gingrich Group has many clients,'' Mr. Gingrich told reporters. ''I offer strategic advice for a lot of different companies.'' (His campaign followed up by listing some of them, including I.B.M.,Microsoft and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.)
And, he said, ''I did no lobbying of any kind.''
In interviews on Tuesday, several former Freddie Mac officials, and others with direct knowledge about his work there did not dispute that. But at least four of them did dispute Mr. Gingrich's own description of his work for Freddie Mac during the CNBC debate last week. When asked about a $300,000-per-year, two-year contract in 2006 and 2007, Mr. Gingrich said he had acted as an ''historian.''
He said Freddie officials had come to ask his advice, as an historian, telling him, ''We are now making loans to people who have no credit history and have no record of paying back anything, but that's what the government wants us to do.''
And, he explained: ''As I said to them at the time, this is a bubble. This is insane. This is impossible.''
Five officials with knowledge of his interactions, and speaking on the condition of anonymity to avoid getting drawn into a public fight with him, said they had never heard of him saying any such thing.
''Freddie wasn't spending $25,000 to $35,000 a month for years to have somebody give them history lessons on what would have happened in 1945 if Japan had won,'' one former official said.
Another said Mr. Gingrich was enlisted at a time when conservatives were moving aggressively to dismantle Freddie and its counterpart,Fannie Mae, and the organizations were trying to fight back by presenting themselves ''as American as apple pie.''
Officials said Mr. Gingrich was brought in to help Freddie Mac hone its message to conservative audiences. One person recalled that Mr. Gingrich advised them, for instance, to tell Republicans that the organization was not explicitly government backed - and, at the time, it was not - but also not as freewheeling as Wall Street banks, occupying a responsible middle ground.
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were commonly referred to as government-sponsored entities. They were established by Congress, and their debt and other obligations have always carried an implicit guarantee that the federal government would step in to save them if they were ever in danger of collapse. Republicans said that the companies - and by implication their Democratic supporters - fueled the crisis by financing vast numbers of unaffordable loans.
In all, Mr. Gingrich served two terms as a consultant to Freddie Mac, the first starting shortly after he left the House in 1999. Hired by the head of the mortgage company's government affairs shop, Robert Mitchell Delk, he stayed on through 2002. In an interview with Bloomberg, Mr. Delk said Mr. Gingrich helped him prepare to meet with White House officials to discuss President George W. Bush's ''ownership society.''
Two other officials said that during his second run with the group, when he took a two-year contract starting in 2006, he addressed donors to the Fannie Mac political action committee and discussed writing an op-ed article or academic ''white paper,'' but never wound up putting his name on anything on Freddie's behalf.
Mr. Gingrich has in recent months been harshly critical of those who have worked with Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. For instance, he said, Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, should be jailed for his association with ''a lobbyist who was close to Freddie Mac.''
On Tuesday, his campaign said that Mr. Gingrich ''believes the financial crisis shows that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac should be broken up and their smaller successors be moved off of government guarantees and into the free market.''
For his part, Mr. Gingrich said he welcomed the scrutiny. ''Everybody will dig up everything they can dig up,'' Mr. Gingrich said. ''That's fine; they should.''
Trip Gabriel, Charles Duhigg and Kitty Bennett contributed reporting.

HEADLINE: Clinton Reaffirms Military Ties With the Philippines

BYLINE: By FLOYD WHALEY

 BODY:
MANILA -- During a high-profile visit to the Philippines on Wednesday, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton stood on the deck of a American warship in Manila Bay and reaffirmed the strong military relationship between the United States and the Philippines.
The visit comes at a time of heightening tensions in the South China Sea related to the oil-rich Spratly Islands, which are the subject of disputed claims by China, the Philippines and other Southeast Asian nations. By some estimates, the energy reserves in the areas being disputed by the various countries could rival those of Kuwait. 
''We are making sure that our collective defense capabilities and communications infrastructure are operationally and materially capable of deterring provocations from the full spectrum of state and nonstate actors,'' Mrs. Clinton said aboard the guided missile cruiser U.S.S. Fitzgerald.
Mrs. Clinton's visit also coincides with a trip to the region by President Obama. On Wednesday, Mr. Obama arrived in the Australian capital of Canberra and announced with Prime Minister Julia Gillard an agreement that allows for an increased military presence in that country. Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton will then attend the East Asian Summit in Indonesia.
While in the Philippines, Mrs. Clinton also signed a pact promoting economic growth and attended a lively public forum in which she took questions from the public. But her appearance on the deck of the warship -- a highly symbolic event -- had greater impact for the militarily weak Philippines as it tangles with a huge neighbor to the north over the Spratly Islands.
''Filipinos appreciate symbolism,'' said Ramon Casiple, executive director of the Manila-based Institute for Political and Economic Reform. ''She did not say anything unusual, but they saw her on a warship in Manila Bay. They received the message.''
Mrs. Clinton, whose visit was marked by relatively modest anti-American protests at the American Embassy in Manila, reiterated Washington's position that territorial disputes in the South China Sea should be settled peacefully. In another gesture not lost on her local audience, she referred to the disputed area by its locally coined name: the West Philippine Sea.
''We are strongly of the opinion that disputes that exist primarily in the West Philippine Sea between the Philippines and China should be resolved peacefully,'' she said during a televised news conference with Philippine secretary for foreign affairs, Albert del Rosario. ''Any nation with a claim has a right to exert it, but they do not have a right to pursue it through intimidation or coercion.''
Following its independence in 1946, the Philippines signed agreements that allowed American military bases to operate in the country. Large American Air Force and Navy bases were closed in the early 1990s after contentious debate in the Philippine Senate, but the 1952 U.S.-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty -- upon which the military relationship is based -- has remained intact.
After the Sept. 11 attacks, American military involvement in the Philippines focused on Islamic extremist groups operating in the southern part of the country. In recent years, broader defense coordination has taken place, including American assistance for the outdated naval forces of the Philippines.
The United States currently has no military bases in the Philippines, though visits by American Navy ships and joint drills are common. In October, the United States and the Philippines conducted war games on the island of Palawan, 50 miles from the disputed area with China.
Mr. Casiple, the analyst, noted that the Philippine government has been careful to balance these military gestures with the recognition that the country needs to maintain close and cordial economic ties with China.
''The Philippines does not want to be the representative of the U.S. military in Southeast Asia,'' he said. ''I think the Philippine government wants to maintain its friendship with both these great powers and not become a ball in the middle being kicked by both sides.''

HEADLINE: UBS Outlines How It Plans to Carry Out Turnaround

BYLINE: SUSANNE CRAIG and JULIA WERDIGIER


HIGHLIGHT: Sergio P. Ermotti, the chief executive of the bank, said his efforts would include shrinking business units and raising capital levels. 

 BODY:
When Sergio P. Ermotti entered the chandelier-drenched ballroom at the Waldorf Astoria hotel in Manhattan for his first investor day at UBS as chief executive, he started choking on a piece of food, prompting a few attendees to joke that he may have bitten off more than he can chew in taking the top spot at the beleaguered Swiss bank.
As he took to the stage, a more composed Mr. Ermotti outlined the much-anticipated turnaround strategy for the firm, which in recent months has weathered the European debt crisis, global market turmoil and a trading scandal that prompted the resignation of his predecessor and dented employee morale.
In his speech on Thursday, Mr. Ermotti, 51, promised to shrink weak business units and to continue bolstering the bank's capital levels. He is also aiming to increase the firm's return on equity - a main measure of profitability - by several percentage points.
"We know these goals are ambitious, but we think they are achievable," he told the crowded room made up of largely analysts and reporters. "Everyone will judge the success of our strategy by our ability to execute."
UBS has endured a turbulent few years.
After becoming Europe's biggest banking casualty during the subprime drama, UBS had to be bailed out by the Swiss National Bank in 2008. The financial firm had slowly started to restore credibility and profits when the sovereign debt crisis hit, hurting business and prompting layoffs.
Then in September, a rogue trading scandal cost the firm more than $2 billion and raised serious questions about its internal risk controls. In the wake of the scandal, Oswald J. Grubel, the chief executive who was expected to revive UBS with a plan for a slimmer but more profitable bank, resigned. Kweku M. Adoboli, the former trader who has been charged with fraud and false accounting for the trades, has yet to enter a plea and faces a court hearing in London next week.
Now it is up to Mr. Ermotti, who joined UBS in April and was named chief executive on Tuesday, to convince clients and employees that the difficult times are behind.
While Mr. Ermotti declined to comment on the trading scandal at the event, he and other senior executives promised a return to the basics. They outlined plans to exit risky businesses like equity proprietary trading, where the firm makes bets with its own capital. It is also in the process of scaling back the investment bank.
Instead, the bank will focus on areas like leveraged finance and corporate lending that offer the potential for good returns with less risk. Mr. Ermotti singled out the firm's wealth management division, telling investors it was not for sale.
The bank will also continue to cut the work force. In August it announced plans to cut 3,500 jobs and said Thursday it would eliminate 400 more positions in the months to come.
But some analysts said Mr. Ermotti, who cut his teeth on Wall Street working at Merrill Lynch, faced a daunting challenge in revamping UBS at a time when the industry was streamlining and coping with stricter capital rules. Credit Suisse, a rival whose investment banking unit has been performing better, has laid out a similar strategy to UBS, raising doubts about how the banks will be able to share the shrinking demand for services and products.
Some analysts have urged more radical options for UBS. Kian Abouhossein at JPMorgan Chase wrote this month that UBS and Credit Suisse could combine their investment banking operations, a step that could create a top-five player by revenue.
On Wednesday, a former UBS chairman, Peter Kurer, who left the bank in 2009, suggested that UBS and Credit Suisse should split their investment banking businesses from the rest of the banks to satisfy shareholders.
"There are few who believe in a great future for investment banks; hardly anyone thinks that Swiss universal banks are good at running integrated investment banks," Mr. Kurer wrote in a commentary for Bloomberg News on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Getting the Message Across to Your Employees

BYLINE: ADRIANA GARDELLA


HIGHLIGHT: The detailed manual offers guidance on everything employees need to know; the only problem is that the employees aren't reading it. 

 BODY:
How do you get your employees to think like you? During a recent meeting of our business group, Alexandra Mayzler raised that question as she weighs expanding her business, Thinking Caps Tutoring, into new markets. Thinking Caps currently has locations in New York City and Austin, Tex. Ms. Mayzler is considering opening a Houston outpost,but said she wants to be sure systems are in place before taking the plunge.
Over the summer, Ms. Mayzler worked with her staff to create a manual that provides a blueprint for opening and running a Thinking Caps location. The detailed manual offers guidance on everything from the proper way to save a document, to the script to use when first meeting with a student's family. But, said Ms. Mayzler, "It's really boring, and I think no one will want to read it." She hopes to find a more dynamic and engaging way to present the information, and she would also like to improve the way the company trains its tutors, which she fears is too boring. 
"We've written four operations manuals for the company at this point," said group member Carissa Reiniger, who founded Silver Lining Limited in 2005. At first, all of the information was included in one document. But it was too much, said Ms. Reiniger. She has since broken it into components. For example, she said, Silver Lining's manuals include a brand book and a "sales bible."
"Did you sit down and write it one fine day?" asked Ms. Mayzler.
"I hired someone to sit me down and ask me questions," said Ms. Reiniger. When she did the writing herself, she said, she found she spoke in a way that made sense to her but not necessarily to the intended audiences. Getting someone to translate her thoughts into a form that others could more readily absorb worked well, she said.
Still, Ms. Mayzler wondered about the boredom. She asked how Silver Lining, which offers an online tool that helps small businesses set and reach financial goals, presents the information. Ms. Reiniger uses Google Sites, an application that lets her create separate Web sites for the different categories of people in the company, including the staff and the certified experts who teach her Silver Lining Action Plan. The sites provide access to materials relevant to each group.
Like Ms. Mayzler, Jessica Johnson, another business group member, has spent the last few months working to standardize processes at her growing company, Johnson Security Bureau. Toward that end, she used a grant from the Economic Development Administration to hire a human resources consulting firm. Working with the consultants, Johnson Security created an intranet site to store material for the company's guards, including their schedules and information on company policies.
The site is also easy to update. One day, after spotting an earring on a uniformed guard, a client called Ms. Johnson to ask if that was allowed. "No," she said. Although the policy was stated in the company's written manual, it was then added to the Web site - "for people who don't like paper," said Ms. Johnson.
Susan Parker, a group member who owns BariJay, a dress manufacturer, asked how the employees were notified of such additions. The site generates and sends e-mails, said Ms. Johnson.
Ms. Reiniger pointed out that, while it's her responsibility to notify the staff of new policies, it is their responsibility to be aware of them. New employees sign a document to that effect. She added that her perspective on presenting company policies has changed. "I built this amazing manual, and no one ever read it," she said. She now sees Silver Lining's written polices more as risk management tools and less as "something I'm going to force everyone to read."
"That's exactly where I am," Ms. Mayzler said. "Except we're working with 13-year-olds, and their parents only care about the end result." If a tutor doesn't read her policies, it becomes Ms. Mayzler's problem.
"I agree with that," said Ms. Reiniger. "It's all of our problems if our products don't work."
Ms. Mayzler agreed. She has a manual and her tutors seem to be reading it, she said, but based on some of their questions, she senses the material is not having an impact. "For all their good intentions, something's not clicking in the way we're communicating," she said. "We're teachers, so we should be able to figure this out." Now, instead of thinking about how to teach math to a 13-year-old, Ms. Mayzler said she will continue to think about how to teach a 25-year-old.

HEADLINE: A Fair A.T.M. Fee? Many Consumers Say 'Zero'

BYLINE: ANN CARRNS


HIGHLIGHT: Most consumers oppose various bank fees, including A.T.M. fees, a survey finds. 

 BODY:
As the events of the last couple of months have shown, Americans do not like to pay bank fees. Indeed, a new survey shows, a majority think the only acceptable A.T.M. fee is no fee at all.
More than half of those surveyed for Ally Bank (an online bank that, surprise, promotes its lack of fees, and reimburses the fees its customers are charged for using other banks' A.T.M.'s) said they thought the only fair A.T.M. fee was zero.
The survey also found that about half of those polled (53 percent) said they would rather take time to search for a free A.T.M. than pay a fee for the closest, most convenient option.
The telephone survey for Ally Bank was conducted in October by the Opinion Research Corporation among 1,016 adults (510 men and 506 women). The margin of sampling error was plus or minus three percentage points.
Here are some other findings in the survey:
 84 percent of respondents said they didn't believe it was acceptable to charge a fee for checking.
 79 percent said they didn't believe it was all right to charge a monthly maintenance fee.
 77 percent said they didn't think it was right to charge an A.T.M. fee.
The findings suggest that many bank customers will be disgruntled, as banks continue to impose a variety of fees on their customers to make up revenue they have lost because of new limits on fees they can charge merchants for processing debit card transactions.
What sort of bank account fees, if any, do you think are acceptable?

HEADLINE: For N.B.A. Players, China Is Up (and the D-League Down )

BYLINE: ROB MAHONEY


HIGHLIGHT: With the N.B.A. season in serious jeopardy, more players than ever may look to China. 

 BODY:
When Deron Williams signed with Besiktas back in July, he was supposedly opening the floodgates. N.B.A. players were expected to follow him across the Atlantic in search of steady income and legitimate competition. The various European leagues were seen as a plentiful resource for players without any obligation to their N.B.A. employers, and a first-class fallback plan in case the collective bargaining negotiations stalled.
But the relationship between the European leagues and the available pool of N.B.A. players was never quite so simple. American players may have considered foreign leagues to be an easy alternative, but each European team had its own dynamics to consider. In the final calculus - after weighing team chemistry, fit, long-term value, and cost - shelling out relatively large salaries for N.B.A. players who aren't even guaranteed to play for an entire season just didn't make sense for every European club. Plenty of players have still been able to find work overseas, but the number of openings is inescapably finite.
It was never as easy as the lockout rhetoric made it seem; the notion of playing overseas as a means of filling the lockout void was almost romanticized, as if N.B.A. players would land on foreign soil and be immediately greeted with equivalent salaries and ample playing time. Needless to say that hasn't been the case, as plenty of N.B.A. players have found the offers from foreign teams to be underwhelming, and many of those currently playing overseas have struggled with either the lifestyle or the playing style of their temporary homes.
Now, with the entire N.B.A. season in serious jeopardy, more players than ever are fighting for what precious few spots - and paychecks - are still to be had. The lockout drags on, and the complexity of the European alternative only grows.
Risk and Reward in China
Though there may not be many remaining roster spots for N.B.A. players in Europe, the Chinese Basketball Association (C.B.A.) provides decent competition and solid compensation--with a catch: Chinese teams are not allowed to sign any N.B.A. player currently under contract. That slashes the pool of possible candidates for the C.B.A., but we've already seen Wilson Chandler, J.R. Smith, Aaron Brooks, and Kenyon Martin - who are all free agents - find employment there, with Jamal Crawford and Rodney Stuckey perhaps not far behind.
China could be the most logical landing spot for restricted and unrestricted free agents, but there are two important considerations for any C.B.A. candidate to consider. The first is the well-publicized fact that the C.B.A. requires any player who signs there to remain for the entire season. If the N.B.A. were to resume, players like Chandler, Smith, Brooks, and Martin would not be able to return to the States until their team's run had concluded. N.B.A. players clearly grasp that the 2011-2012 season may not happen, but are they willing to potentially miss months of a shortened campaign should the lockout be lifted?
Additionally, though the C.B.A. may offer better pay than most other foreign leagues, free agents would be putting plenty at risk by playing outside of the N.B.A. A major injury sustained during the lockout would hurt any player, but free agents would be putting their earning power - and immediate chance at a much bigger N.B.A. payday - at risk. Still, the odds of such an injury are quite slim, and with the likelihood of an N.B.A. season diminished following the players' recent legal maneuver, China becomes an increasingly more palatable option.
Trickle-Down Economics
Even with the N.B.A. facing a work stoppage, the Development League - the N.B.A.'s minor league affiliate - is set to begin its season in short order. However, the disclaimer of interest filed by the National Basketball Players Association on Monday could have devastating effects on the D-League's player pool this season.
The D-League's primary allure is the potential for a call-up to the big leagues, and without that carrot dangling above the heads of fringe prospects, there isn't much reason to take part. The D-League's standard salaries are far below what some players can earn elsewhere, and many of the league's base cities - Fort Wayne, Bakersfield, Boise - hold little outside appeal for professional athletes. The D-League has real value when the N.B.A. is in session, but for the moment it lacks the ability to create a true reward system for its players.
We may already be seeing the impact of that unfortunate truth. According to Adrian Wojnarowski of Yahoo Sports, Alando Tucker, who was selected with the No. 2 pick in the D-League draft just two weeks ago, has agreed to a deal with C.B. Gran Canaria of the Spanish A.C.B. League. Tucker was among the more high-profile D-League players, but the potential for superior earning overseas is hardly unique to him. D-League players may be able to find the sweet spot in European clubs' financial goals, as they can contribute on a professional level without pulling in the substantial salary that N.B.A. talent demands.
It may seem odd that a team would elect to sign a D-Leaguer rather than an N.B.A. veteran, but many smaller clubs are priced out of the running for N.B.A. regulars. Plus, the fact that a player like Tucker has had experience with two different international teams certainly doesn't hurt, particularly when considering how many N.B.A. players have struggled to produce in their first European tours. Tucker may be the first D-League player to bolt as a result of the lockout's legal proceedings, but considering the value of affordable talent in overseas leagues, he likely won't be the last.

HEADLINE: Thinking Outside the Bus

BYLINE: LISA MARGONELLI


HIGHLIGHT: When public transportation finds the people who need to use it, and gets them where they want to go, it can grow organically. 

 BODY:
Until September of 2010, Pam Boucher's life was small. Living in Brunswick, Me., a rural town of 21,000, she was dependent upon others to move. At the time, she used crutches or a walker to get around and seizures prevented her from driving. She'd get rides to medical appointments from a social service agency. Trips to buy groceries, or visit her husband in a nursing home, required the help of her adult sons or scheduling a social service staff member. A trip to the local Wal-Mart would cost $28 in taxi fees. Socializing outside her apartment was pretty much impossible. "I was very limited," she says.
But when Brunswick started running two small 14-seat hybrid buses around town, Boucher, who is 59, immediately hopped on. The Brunswick Explorer travels a 7-mile route every hour in both directions. Now in a wheelchair, Boucher calls me from a bus stop, where she's waiting with a friend. The bus has changed her life, she says, giving her independence, control over her time and the ability to socialize. "I take it at least once a day. Sometimes three times." She meets friends on the bus, takes herself to her medical appointments, and goes shopping for groceries afterwards. A few months ago the bus extended its hours into the evening to accommodate more commuters; she can now shop for groceries in the evening if her day has been spent at medical appointments. 
As we're talking the airy green bus pulls up and extends the ramp so she can wheel her chair onto it. She yells jokingly at her friend, "Are you going to leave me here? Hah. Doug won't leave me here." She turns back to the phone to explain. "Doug's the driver. He's really good to me. He's knows my condition and that I sometimes forget where I am."
America's famously car-dependent culture strands the Pam Bouchers among us: those too old, too young, or too sick to drive cars. Overall, only 5 percent of Americans use public transit to get to work and that number is somewhat distorted by the huge numbers of people in cities who commute by subway, train or bus. Outside of metropolitan areas, the number of Americans taking public transit falls to just 1.2 percent. With so few people on the bus, schedules become infrequent and inconvenient, and ridership drops further. As local governments have cut back in the recession, some buses have gone away. Options for rural commuters have been falling even as gas prices have been rising: Between 2005 and 2009 the number of America's rural residents who had the option of taking any bus at all fell to 78 percent from 89 percent.
Lack of transit literally hurts many Americans. The 40 percent of American military veterans who live in rural areas report much lower health quality of life scores than urban veterans. The Veterans Administration attributes this in part to poor transit to medical facilities. Lack of transit to after-school sports means that rural kids are 25 percent more likely to be obese. And the future will be grimmer: by 2015, 15 million elderly people will be without access to transportation. In Atlanta, 90 percent of seniors will be without access to transit. Studies have shown that when seniors can no longer drive their cars, they cease participating in society: Visits to friends and family fall by 65 percent; shopping and eating trips fall by 59 percent. Boucher's experience in Brunswick is the exception rather than the rule.
Conventional wisdom says that the way to create or improve public transit is to invest billions to engineer rails, trains and buses. But the Brunswick Explorer is one of many innovators that are seeing transit as more than an engineering problem and trying to build transit that meets the needs of its residents. 
This week Fixes looks at this and two other small but intriguing transit initiatives. They operate on wildly different models: The Brunswick Explorer is public; it is paid for by riders, who pay a nominal fare, and a combination of federal and local sources, including the town of Brunswick. Another involves private entrepreneurs providing van service; and the third is a non-profit that has radically re-thought the terms of mobility. Together these three programs suggest that we could get a lot more out of our transit dollars - and more important, get a lot more people from place to place - if we approached potential transit riders as customers, and gave them exactly what they need.
In the world of public transit, the Brunswick Explorer is a radical idea. Its genesis came from a coalition of local social service agencies - organizations that work with the elderly, mentally ill, disabled, homeless, as well as with college students and local hospitals. They approached Coastal Transit, a nonprofit regional transit provider to be a part of their coalition. Coastal Transit's executive director, Lee Karker, had worked on two other rural bus systems that fell apart. Both were designed to fill objectives other than helping riders; one was supposed to clear congestion out of a tourist town, and the other just drove from one end of town to the other without much regard for where riders wanted to go. Karker describes the process of setting up the Explorer as "more organic." "Before when we looked at bus routes we got input on traffic patterns, not input from the users," he said. "Now we're trying to be more entrepreneurial." Working as part of the coalition, rather than as transit engineers, changed their worldview. "We have a tendency to make a transit system look the way we think it should look rather than what the community needs and what they want," Karker said.
What the community wanted was a system that ran every hour, that was easy for people like Boucher with mobility issues to use, was green, and that went everywhere they'd like to go - from housing projects to doctors' appointments to the town's grocery stores, malls and Wal-Marts. Brunswick's buses are small and have green hybrid drivetrains. While bus stops in other towns are often placed on access roads to malls, leaving riders to traverse acres of icy parking lots, the Explorer pulls right up under the canopy of the Shaw's supermarket so that a wheelchair user can easily roll off the bus and into the store without braving snow, rain or uneven pavement. And while the bus travels a set route, it will detour to make pickups if called in advance.
So far, Brunswick's ridership has increased by 50 percent in the past year, to an average of 91 people a day in October of 2011. Stops were added to the route as calls from passengers increased. The hours have been extended - they now run from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. - so that more commuters can ride.
John Secone, the bus's supervisor, who sometimes works as a driver, tells me about his customers as I sit in the town's neat bus station in early November. One of the first riders of the day, he says, is a man who takes the bus to his job at Wendy's. Students from Bowdoin College have started taking the bus to school. For a few riders it's been a revelation: a man in his early 20's who'd only been able to take paratransit to medical appointments visited Wal-Mart on the Explorer for the first time. Secone describes the bus as a community, where people meet friends, and where people have expectations of the bus and its drivers that go well beyond boundaries of a typical bureaucracy.
The lesson of the Explorer is that when transportation finds the people who need to use it, and then gets them where they want to go, it can grow organically. In the next two years, the Explorer will have to stretch as a green industrial park opens at the site of an old naval base and the train line from Boston links to Brunswick. Anticipating this change, some nearby towns have begun to design connecting Explorer links of their own. The challenge will be to expand the route according to the desires of its passengers, rather than to accomplish abstract goals of local governments. Here Karker suggests that empowered riders may just hijack the system for their own uses. The bureaucracy of one nearby town has been dithering for months about the pros and cons of linking their transit system to the Explorer. Riders have been much quicker to improvise. One resident in a nearby town cobbles together rides to link up with the Explorer; she's taking charge of her own mobility. "More power to 'em," laughs Karker, at her ingenuity. It's emblematic, he says, of a larger question of how many people would really like to use the bus: "We really don't have a sense of how big the potential could be here."
But transportation does not have to be a public enterprise, as an example on the extreme urban side of the spectrum has shown: The hundreds of private "dollar vans" that zip around the streets of Brooklyn and Queens looking for passengers offer an intriguing model of transit that meets customers' needs because drivers are the owners and operators of the vans. While many of these vans are legal and insured to carry passengers, some are not, and all of them suffer from archaic laws that prohibit them from picking up passengers at curbs. Trundling down Brooklyn's Flatbush Avenue, Winston Williams's Ford 350 van is worlds away from rural Maine. Like Williams, most of his passengers this weekday morning are former residents of Caribbean islands where jitney-style vans provide cheap transit, and they're familiar with the ritual of flagging down vans and paying two dollars to ride. Williams's company, Blackstreet Van Lines, runs eight vans, collecting hundreds of people a day. One morning as I ride with Williams, he talks about business ideas - expanding routes to carry hipsters places where subways are inconvenient, branding vans to build a presence, putting advertising on the vans to increase profits. The biggest hurdle to increasing ridership, he says, is resolving the legality of the whole fleet - both legalizing pickups and eliminating the unpermitted vans.
Legal issues aside, private vans provide services no public system could support, says David King, an assistant professor of urban planning at Columbia University. The concentration of vans along Flatbush means that sometimes there's a van every minute, so riders don't have to wait. Sometimes they'll take a mother and child to daycare and then wait at the curb while the mother walks the child up to the door of the facility - something a city bus would never do. Always on the lookout for customers, the drivers make routes where customers don't have other options. A van between Chinatowns in Flushing, Queens, and Sunset Park in Brooklyn, for instance, can take as little as 20 minutes when the subway would take over an hour. King says that he sees potential to enhance transit options for everyone by incorporating dollar van type services.
For one thing, dollar vans quickly learn passengers' desired routes, like traveling between Chinatowns. This sort of knowledge could help public transit planners design systems that keep up with riders' real needs. Dollar vans' ability to scale up dramatically intrigues King. "According to our estimates, the dollar vans are carrying 120,000 riders a day in New York, which makes them the country's 20th largest bus system."
Still, many people do not want to ride the bus, and that's where a third model comes in - this one a nonprofit that re-envisions the accepted ideas of transit for the elderly and disabled. ITN (Independent Travel Network) is a 15-year-old nonprofit that has grown from a single program in Portland, Me., to a travel network of 18 cities providing 4,000 rides a month. ITN, which was founded by Katherine Freund after her 3-year-old son was hit by an 84-year-old driver, offers a radical rethinking of mobility. "The spark was that I tried to approach the problem (of senior mobility) in a businesslike way," Freund says.
Freund decided to make ITN sustainable for the long term, by trying to avoid surviving on public money. "You can't solve a problem without sufficient resources." She decided to link needy riders with the "excess capacity" of other drivers willing to take them out and walk them arm in arm to their destination. To pay for the service, ITN created "transit savings accounts" which essentially standardize and financialize rides, making them transferable without currency. So I could give elders rides in California and transfer the credits I've "banked" to my mother in New England. Elders can also donate their cars to ITN and receive credits to their accounts. And recently retired drivers can "bank" rides for themselves later by driving others now. This fall, the program logged 330,000 rides, and Freund is working on a bold national plan to create dynamic ride-sharing for people of all ages.
Freund thinks most transit planners, focused on schedules and infrastructure investments, don't really get what moves people. "Mobility is not a car or a train, but really a primitive feeling - a value - of knowing you can move where and when you want. The ability to move is a basic as the difference between being a plant and being an animal. It's these basic feelings - like love - that really motivate people," she says.
With a baby boomer retiring every eight seconds, and gas prices and carbon emissions rising, the challenge of moving Americans around requires huge real investments of public and private money. In 2008 the National Surface Transportation Commission found that we need to double or triple spending on transit to keep up with the growth in population over the next 50 years. But the potential for re-thinking what we think we know about transit, for concentrating on the mechanics of the human brain and our culture as much as the mechanics of bus lines, seems limitless. What innovations do you see? And how do you see transit changing or failing to change to meet your needs?

HEADLINE: No Basketball, Fewer Bar Customers

BYLINE: PATRICK FARRELL


HIGHLIGHT: New York bar owners say that while players and owners bicker, they pay the price. 

 BODY:
The players are locked out. The fans are depressed. And now the N.B.A. stalemate has claimed a whole new class of victims: New York's bar owners, who say they're losing as much as a third of their revenue because sports fans and tourists aren't showing up to watch games.
At a news conference at noon on Thursday at an Upper West Side watering hole - P.D. O'Hurley's on West 72nd Street - State Senator Malcolm A. Smith of Queens joined the heads of the United Restaurant and Tavern Owners Association, which represents 3,000 bars in New York City, and the Long Island Restaurant Owners Association to announce a new petition drive urging the players and owners to settle.
They said bar receipts in the region were down 30 percent from last year at this time - an estimated loss of up to $40 million since July, when contract talks broke down. Even if an agreement is reached soon, the earliest that play could resume is mid-December. And the longer the impasse continues, they said, the more likely that fans will lose the sports-bar habit. 
Winning or losing, the Knicks have been a bankable draw not only for bars, but also for liquor distributors, cabdrivers and other small businesses, said Todd Shapiro, spokesman for the tavern owners' association. He said the team generated about $30 million a month for the local economy during the basketball season -- in what he termed, aptly, "a trickle effect." 
"Now, if a guy doesn't go to see a game, the person parking his car is getting no money," he said. "There are no taxis to be taken, no pretzels to be sold."

The petitions will start circulating this weekend in more than 2,200 bars, along with banners proclaiming, "Don't Play Games With Fans: Play on the Courts."
Can't football fans carry the ball for New York's economy? Mr. Shapiro thought not. "Have you been to a basketball game lately?" he asked. "People spend money, they get dressed up. For a football game, they dress for the cold. This is like going to the opera."

HEADLINE: Among Compact Crossovers, 'Best in Class' Proves a Highly Contentious Title

BYLINE: JERRY GARRETT


HIGHLIGHT: The newly introduced Ford Escape, Honda CR-V and Mazda CX-5 crossovers all stake a claim to having best-in-class fuel economy. 

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES - At the unveiling of the Mazda CX-5 on Wednesday, the automaker promised press conference attendees that the new small crossover would deliver "best-in-class fuel mileage."
Later in the day, at the unveiling of its redesigned CR-V small crossover, Honda flashed a big graphic on a video screen: "Best-in-class fuel economy."
Meanwhile, over at the Ford stand, the new Escape small crossover was being introduced with, of course, "best-in-class fuel economy."
All these vehicles are in the same class, and all claim a superlative that, barring a tie, has a built-in limiter: there can be only one. So what's going on?
"I don't think anyone is being deceitful," said Mark Schirmer, a spokesman for Ford, during an interview at the automaker's stand on Wednesday. "The first guy to announce his fuel-economy figures gets to claim 'best in class' if no one else has announced theirs yet."
Mr. Schirmer said all three vehicles were likely to be certified with highway fuel economy ratings of "32, 33 miles per gallon." Would a tie be shared graciously among the combatants?
"Maybe all three will wind up getting the same mileage, and it'll be kind of a tie," he said. "But we all get 33 m.p.g., say, I'm still going to call mine best in class. I won't be wrong. But I'm not going to say, 'Tied for best-in-class fuel economy.'"
Mr. Schirmer said that Ford had yet to announce specific mileage figures for the new Escape, but that highway mileage on the high end should be close to 33 m.p.g., if not slightly more. "Maybe our guys can look at what the competition is offering and go back and see if there is a little tweak here or there, in the exhaust system or gearing, to get that little extra out of it for bragging rights," he said.
"If we can get even 33.5, they let you round up to the next number. So, believe me, we'll be looking at every fraction," he added.
He cautioned, however, that the CR-V, CX-5 and Escape are all kind of "sitting ducks," while another segment titan, Toyota, bides its time.
"Toyota isn't going to bring out the new RAV4 for a few weeks yet," he said about Toyota''s compact crossover. "They will know what we've got by then, and they'll do everything they can to top all of us."
So the next installment in the best-in-class sweepstakes for small crossovers will come in early January, at the Detroit auto show, when the RAV4 is expected to make its debut.

HEADLINE: 2012 Honda CR-V: Cautious Makeover for a Best-Selling Crossover

BYLINE: TORI TELLEM


HIGHLIGHT: Honda will begin sales of its redesigned crossover on Dec. 15. 

 BODY:
Introduced on Wednesday, Nov. 16: 2012 Honda CR-V.
What is it? It's the production version of the CR-V concept that made its global debut in September at the Orange County auto show, spitting distance from the Los Angeles show. 
What they said: "Compact on the outside and roomy inside, the CR-V represents an ideal balance for size and capability in the entry S.U.V. segment," Honda said in a news release.
What they didn't say: We live in a time when an entry-level family mover from Honda does not offer a manual transmission.
What makes it tick? It's back -- the 2.4-liter i-VTEC 4-cylinder is rated at 185 horsepower and 163 pound-feet of torque and connected to a 5-speed automatic transmission. Fuel economy is up, to the tune of 23 m.p.g. around town and 31 m.p.g. on the highway. Much in the manner of the SmartGauge on the Ford Fusion hybrid, Eco Assist is a new, passive system that shoots "green visual cues" up around the speedo when the car's throttle is under judicious management.
How much, how soon? Mark your calendar for Dec. 15. Mark your check register for prices within the range of the outgoing CR-V, roughly $21,000-$30,000. Models will begin with a base LX and progress to the EX through to the fanciest, the EX-L.
How's it look? Safe. Dependable. Predictable. Those are likely words Honda wouldn't mind hearing about the fourth-generation CR-V. But when those are uttered about the styling? It's time to loosen up, Honda, and take some chances.

HEADLINE: Dok-Ing Automotiv: A Show-Stealing Croatian Upstart Makes Debut in Los Angeles

BYLINE: BRADLEY BERMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The company is showing its XD electric runabout with the hope that it would attract an American investor. 

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- If there were an award for Most Unique Car at the 2011 Los Angeles auto show, a judge would be hard pressed to explain a vote in favor of anything other than the XD electric vehicle from Dok-Ing Automotiv.
It's not only that the XD is built in Croatia, a country that -- at least for now -- does not evoke River Rouge-like manufacturing plants. It's not only the car's carbon fiber, aluminum and Kevlar; its luxury appointments; its fully digital touch screen instrument panel; its claimed zero-to-62-m.p.h. acceleration of 4.2 seconds via four high-power motors; and its diminutive nine-foot body that seats three people -- one in front and two either side of the driver.
It's all of these things, and the fact that the XD is the singular vision of one man, Vjekoslav Majetic.
Mr. Majetic, Dok-Ing's chief executive, worked with a Croatian industrial designer, who worked much like a tailor would produce a custom suit. "I don't like this. Remove it. Move this over here, and so on," said Mr. Majetic of the design process in an interview at Dok-Ing's stand at the auto show. The designer duly responded to his boss's vision of an ideal personal car.
"I will put myself in the middle because it's the safest place in the car," Mr. Majetic said, explaining why the steering column was not positioned toward the right or left, but down the middle. The two passengers stretch their legs past the driver on either side and enter the car through gullwing doors after the driver is seated.
"If you multiply Smart with the Rolls-Royce, you get the Dok-Ing XD," said Zoran Segina, a Los Angeles-based automotive journalist from Zagreb, where the XD is built.
Mr. Segina explained how it came to be that Mr. Majetic, whose company builds heavy-duty remote-control vehicles used for clearing landmines, as well as robotic firefighting vehicles, decided to seek a vehicle to replace his BMW X5.
"The streets of Zagreb are narrow, parking is nearly nonexistent and gasoline costs about $10 a gallon," Mr. Segina said. Not satisfied with anything on the market, Mr. Majetic chose to use his company's one million square feet of manufacturing capacity to build his dream car.
The chassis of the XD was designed and manufactured from the ground up by Dok-Ing in Croatia, as was the car's computer control systems. The company tapped Bosch, a major auto supplier, for the car's braking and electronic stability systems.
The packaging of the XD is clever, yielding more rear cargo space than what's offered in the similarly sized Smart Fortwo. "My friends are always joking with me that we'll first sell this car to the mobsters, because it's small and it's fast," said Tomislav Bosko, Mr. Majetic's son-in-law and Dok-Ing's product manager. "And because the trunk is big enough to fit a body," he added.
Dok-Ing, a company with annual sales of $40 million, according to Mr. Majetic, has made only three units. One is here at the show, while in Croatia there is an open-top version as well as one equipped with all-wheel drive.
Dok-Ing Automotiv has spent about $3 million, according to Mr. Bosko. The company hopes to ramp up to about 1,000 of the cars per year, after selling about 100 in Europe in 2012. The price tag is $80,000.
Dok-Ing is showing its XD in Los Angeles with the hope that it would attract an American investor to bring the car to the United States. The E.V. is exhibited directly adjacent to luxury wares from Rolls-Royce, Aston Martin, Bentley and another start-up, the Mexican supercar company Mastretta.
Mr. Majetic only said a few words at Dok-Ing's press conference here Thursday, but he made them count.
"If you have dreams, and you really want to achieve them, you can do what you wish," he said.
"If you have money," his son-in-law added.

HEADLINE: 'End of the Rainbow' Finds a Broadway Home

BYLINE: PATRICK HEALY


HIGHLIGHT: "End of the Rainbow," a hit London drama-with-music about Judy Garland's final months, will play in New York this spring at the Belasco Theater, one of the last Broadway houses to announce its booking for the coming theater season. 

 BODY:
"End of the Rainbow," a hit about Judy Garland's final months, will play in New York this spring at the Belasco Theater, one of the last Broadway houses to announce its booking for the coming theater season. The show's producers announced on Thursday that its star, the British actress Tracie Bennett, who received critical praise for the West End production, will be joined on Broadway by Michael Cumpsty (the 2008 revival of "Sunday in the Park With George") as her gay pianist, Anthony; Tom Pelphrey (a daytime Emmy Award winner on "Guiding Light") as her young fiance, Mickey; and Jay Russell in various other roles. Written by Peter Quilter and directed by Terry Johnson (a Tony Award winner in 2010 for "La Cage aux Folles"), "End of the Rainbow" will begin preview performances on March 19; the show will open on April 2 instead of the previously announced April 3.
Broadway's 40 theaters have been relatively busy in recent seasons, with the economic recession not proving a significant drag on theater producing; only two theaters, the Lyceum and Studio 54, are without an announced booking for the near future.

HEADLINE: United States of Hunger

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: Last year, more than one in 10 families received food stamps, but the share was highest in Oregon, where nearly one in five families did so, according to a new Census Bureau report. 

 BODY:
Casey Mulligan noted Wednesday on Economix that United States spending on food stamps had skyrocketed since the recession began. A new Census Bureau report provides a look at just how big the program has become. Last year, more than one in 10 families received food stamps, with some states having significantly higher participation rates. In Oregon, the share was nearly one in five.
Here's a map showing what share of families in each state received these benefits to help them buy food:
In Oregon, 17.8 percent of families received food stamps, officially known as Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, the highest rate in the nation. Oregon was followed by Tennessee (17 percent) and Michigan (16.9 percent).
The state with the lowest SNAP participation rate was Wyoming, with a rate of 6.2 percent. The next-lowest rates were in New Jersey (6.8 percent) and California (7.4 percent).
I must admit I'm a bit puzzled by some of these numbers. I would have expected California's food stamp take-up rate, for example, to be much higher, since its unemployment rate is 11.9 percent, the state is broke, and so many cities there suffered from housing busts.
I did a quick scatterplot showing the relationship between median household income and food stamp take-up rates, and the relationship is relatively weak:
The relationship between unemployment rates and food stamp take-up rates was even weaker:
Of course, there are a lot of variables not at all reflected by unemployment and median income figures, such as inequality and state safety net programs.

HEADLINE: An Edge in Science Among the Foreign-Born

BYLINE: MOTOKO RICH


HIGHLIGHT: A Census report quantifies the nationwide gap in degrees in the STEM fields -- science, technology, engineering and math -- between native-born and foreign-born college graduates. 

 BODY:
I've previously written about the wage advantage - as well as the simple likelihood of finding and holding onto a job - that comes with a bachelor's degree in science, technology, engineering or math.
 The study in that case concluded that many American technology and scientific companies are forced to recruit from abroad. 
 But they can also hire from the foreign-born population currently in the United States. According to a new Census report, a much higher proportion of foreign-born residents 25 or older with bachelor's degrees earned their degrees in science, technology, engineering or math -- the STEM fields -- than native-born holders of bachelor's degrees.
 The Census report looked at a broader range of degrees than usually considered when defining STEM fields. Majors analyzed by the Census authors, Christine Gambino and Thomas Gryn, included computers, math, statistics; biology, agriculture and environmental science; physical and related sciences; psychology; social sciences; engineering; and multidisciplinary sciences.
 Among the foreign-born bachelor's degree holders, 46 percent had majored in a science or engineering field. That compares with 33 percent of native-born college graduates. One-third of all residents with a B.A. in engineering are foreign-born.
 Of the 4.2 million foreign-born residents who have science- or engineering-related bachelor's degrees, 57 percent came from Asia, while 18 percent came from Europe and 16 percent from Latin America. Immigrants from India produced the largest number of college graduates in science and engineering, followed by Chinese-born immigrants.
 Like American-born women, foreign-born women are generally less likely to major in STEM fields. While 51 percent of foreign-born college graduates were women, women represented only 37 percent of those with science or engineering degrees.

HEADLINE: Protests Illustrate Dire Economic Anxiety, Bloomberg Says

BYLINE: KATE TAYLOR


HIGHLIGHT: The mayor's remarks to a group of business leaders represented a subtle shift from his previous statements. 

 BODY:
As Occupy Wall Street protesters massed in Lower Manhattan on Thursday morning, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg was in Midtown, telling an audience of business leaders that the protests were a dire sign of the public's economic fears.
"We're coming to a point where Occupy Wall Street is just the beginning, the Tea Party is just the beginning," he said. "The public is getting scared. They don't know what to do, and they're going to strike out, and they don't know where."
 "Occupy Wall Street had this great saying, and they were chanting it: 'We don't know what we want, but we want it now,' " the mayor continued, prompting laughter from the crowd, which included Rupert Murdoch.
"And if you think about it, that tells you what the problem is," he said. "They just know the system isn't working, and they don't want to wait around,'' he said, for another hollow promise by politicians (the mayor punctuated his remarks with an expletive).
The tone of the mayor's remarks - at a panel on immigration organized by the Partnership for New York City and the Partnership for a New American Economy - represented a subtle departure from his usual stance on the Occupy Wall Street movement. Over the nearly two months that the protesters occupied Zuccotti Park, the mayor in his public appearances repeatedly expressed his support for freedom of speech, while largely dismissing the protesters' critique of economic institutions.
At the panel on Thursday morning, he repeated his contention that it would be more productive for the protesters to work to improve the economy, rather than demonstrating, and he criticized those, including politicians, who vilify banks. But he seemed to take the protesters' anger more seriously than he had before, and to express more concern about possible consequences of the unrest.
His comments echoed remarks he had made on Sept. 16, on his weekly radio program, when he raised the prospect that youth unemployment might cause riots in the United States.
"That's what happened in Cairo; that's what happened in Madrid," he said at the time. "You don't want those kinds of riots here."
The Occupy Wall Street protests started the next day.
Mr. Bloomberg was joined on the Thursday panel by the former mayor of Toronto, David Miller, and the founder and chairman of Grupo Salinas, Ricardo B. Salinas Pliego; the moderator was The New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman. The panelists praised the role of immigrants in creating jobs, with Mr. Miller arguing that Canada's open immigration laws had benefited its economy. Mr. Bloomberg urged the business leaders in the audience to put pressure on President Obama and members of Congress to enact immigration reform, and to threaten to work for their opponents if they did not.
Correction: November 17, 2011 
An earlier version of this post incorrectly stated that former Citigroup Chairman Sanford I. Weill was at the forum at which Mr. Bloomberg spoke. Mr. Weill was not at the event.

HEADLINE: Design Unveiled for Tower at Atlantic Yards

BYLINE: CHARLES V. BAGLI


HIGHLIGHT: At 32 stories, the residential building would be the tallest prefabricated or modular steel structure in the world. 

 BODY:
The developer Bruce C. Ratner unveiled the design Thursday for what would be the world's tallest prefabricated steel structure, a 32-story residential building in Brooklyn at the corner of Flatbush Avenue and Dean Street in the $4.9 billion Atlantic Yards project.
The 350-unit building would use varying rectangular shapes, colors and glass to break up the mass of the structure, which would sit snugly up against the Barclays Center, the arena for the Nets that is to open in September. Mr. Ratner, chief executive of Forest City Ratner, said that prefabrication, or modular construction, could save construction time and cut costs by as much as 25 percent. Fourteen other residential buildings would be built at Atlantic Yards using the approach. The second tower would be even taller, 50 stories.
Forest City Ratner is also negotiating a labor agreement with construction unions, which have supported Atlantic Yards but could end up with fewer jobs and lower wages for some trades if modular construction is used. 
Mr. Ratner said Thursday that he hoped to begin construction early in 2012. But the start date has been a moving target for more than a year. He may ultimately decide to build the first tower conventionally. But Mr. Ratner's company has now invested two years in studying modular construction, a technology that has existed for decades but is untested at this height. The world's tallest modular building is a 25-story dormitory in Wolverhampton, England, that was built in 2010 in less than 12 months. 
In New York City, the School Construction Authority has used the technology to build classrooms, and the Capsys Corporation, a modular builder based at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, has built prefabricated steel-frame housing up to seven stories tall in Brooklyn and on Long Island.
Mr. Ratner said 60 percent of the construction would take place in a factory, where an estimated 190 workers would assemble roughly 950 steel-frame modules, each 14 feet by 35 feet, and outfit them with electric and plumbing lines, as well as with kitchen and bathroom pods. At the same time, on-site workers would build the foundation. The modules would be transported to the site, lifted into place by crane and bolted together. Steel bracing would rise with the stacked modules. 
The trick for developers, architects and engineers in erecting taller modular buildings has been to design an economical bracing system to protect the structure from wind shear and seismic forces. Some modular builders say the cost of a high-rise bracing system would be prohibitive. Mr. Ratner is working with SHoP Architects, the structural engineering firm Arup and XSite Modular. "If anybody can crack the code," he said, "this group can."
The development once promised "upwards of 17,000 union construction jobs and over 8,000 permanent jobs." The large number of jobs was a significant reason the state and the city agreed to provide $300 million in direct subsidies for Atlantic Yards. 
Mr. Ratner, a union builder, said modular construction would "probably" require the same number of workers. But under current wage scales, union workers earn less in a factory than they do on-site. A carpenter, for instance, earns $85 an hour in wages and benefits at a construction site, compared with $35 in a factory setting.
 Gary LaBarbera, president of the Building and Construction Trades Council of Greater New York, said, "We are in the process of attempting to reach an agreement that will work for the building trades and Forest City in an effort to create permanent employment." 
This week, seven Brooklyn workers who participated in a Forest City job-training program sued Mr. Ratner, Forest City and Brooklyn United for Innovative Local Development over unpaid wages and damages for what they said was the false promise of jobs. Forest City disputes the claims, saying it never promised union membership. As of September, it said, 19 of the 35 people who went through the program were working in related jobs.
Still, the jobs issue has become a touchstone for opponents of the project like Councilwoman Letitia James, who denounced what she described as the growing distance between the promise and the reality of Atlantic Yards.

HEADLINE: Hints of Tension Chip at a Hero's Welcome for Cuomo

BYLINE: THOMAS KAPLAN


HIGHLIGHT: Mr. Cuomo remains extremely popular within the Democratic Party, but signs of strain are evident among more liberal party members. 

 BODY:
COLONIE, N.Y. - Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo was received as a hero on Thursday at a meeting of the state's Democratic Party, with elected officials crediting him for several critical victories in local government elections last week, and the governor highlighting those elections as a referendum on his first 10 months in office.
But Mr. Cuomo's appearance before his party's leadership also had signs of continuing tension between the popular governor and the liberal wing of the Democratic Party. After he departed, some party members sought unsuccessfully to pass resolutions that would have rebuked parts of Mr. Cuomo's handling of economic and environmental issues.
A resolution calling for a ban on a controversial form of natural gas extraction known as hydraulic fracturing - which the Cuomo administration is preparing to allow in some parts of the state - was tabled at the meeting. So was a resolution calling for raising taxes on the wealthiest New Yorkers, a step that Mr. Cuomo has opposed. 
The state's Democratic Party chairman, Jay Jacobs, said he had opposed the measures because they could "embarrass the governor.''
"In the current environment, with what the governor's doing, the successes he's had and his leadership, this is exactly the wrong time to send the wrong message,'' Mr. Jacobs said. "And the fact that a very vocal, and I would have to say well-intentioned, minority wants to make their personal views known is not an excuse for us as the Democratic Party to have to engage in that kind of an endorsement that might be looked upon in the press and elsewhere as being opposed to the governor's position, which we're not."
The governor did not mention taxes or hydrofracking during 15 minutes of remarks to the state committee, and he did not take questions from reporters when he left, exiting through a back door and hopping into a running sport utility vehicle.
In his remarks, at the Desmond Hotel and Conference Center just outside Albany, Mr. Cuomo talked about the challenge of job creation, which has become an increasingly dominant talking point in his remarks at public appearances in recent weeks.
The Democrats on hand remained silent when Mr. Cuomo trumpeted his signature economic achievement, a cap on local property taxes. But they cheered the governor when he mentioned several other topics, including his closing of prisons and juvenile justice centers and the legalization of same-sex marriage.
The governor personally congratulated several Democrats who won local races, including the newly elected mayor of Yonkers and the county executives-elect in Erie and Suffolk Counties, all of whom he campaigned for. He offered their victories, and others in more local races, as evidence that voters were satisfied with the agenda he had pushed in Albany in his first year as governor.
"We ran on our statewide record," Mr. Cuomo said. "We said, you elected the Democrats when you elected Cuomo in January, and we delivered for the people of the state, period. We did what we said we were going to do."
The governor also used the occasion to offer a rare moment of political philosophizing. He said that part of the reason that Democrats in New York were so successful in this month's elections was because Republican candidates framed their campaigns around blaming government, as opposed to reforming it.
"They had an argument that basically says, whatever the problem, it's caused by government," Mr. Cuomo said. "That's all they say, over and over and over, and that's not an oversimplification. We argue the exact opposite: that government is possibility. Why? Because government is us. All government is, is the vehicle, the organization, for us, and we believe in us."

HEADLINE: City's Jobless Rate Climbs to 8.8%

BYLINE: PATRICK MCGEEHAN


HIGHLIGHT: The unemployment picture in New York City continues to worsen. 

 BODY:
 New York City's unemployment rate rose to 8.8 percent in October, as the city's recovery from the recession continued to falter.
 The city's job market had bounced back more strongly from the recession than that of the country as a whole. But that gap has narrowed this year as the rate of job growth in the city has slowed. The city's unemployment rate, which had been 8.7 percent in September, is not significantly lower than the national rate, which dipped to 9 percent from 9.1 percent in September.
 The city added about 25,000 jobs during the month, according to the State Labor Department. But an independent analysis of the numbers found that, after adjusting for the usual increase in hiring that takes place in October, the city lost about 2,000 jobs. The department adjusts most of its numbers for seasonal fluctuations but not its data for the city.
 After the adjustments, almost every industry shed jobs last month, said Barbara Byrne Denham, an economist with Eastern Consolidated, a real estate services firm. Ms. Denham publishes a report each month after making the seasonal adjustments.
 She said she was troubled by the weakness in advance of the broad layoffs on Wall Street that have been announced and forecast. "These layoff announcements clearly haven't hit the data," Ms. Denham said. "That's why I am concerned. This projection of 10,000 job losses in securities - if it hasn't come yet, then it's coming soon."
 The State Labor Department reported that the biggest increase in employment in the city last month came in professional and business services, which includes high-paying jobs at law and accounting firms. But Ms. Denham said her analysis showed that most of that growth came in temporary positions. Still, she said, those jobs could lead to permanent hiring if the economy strengthens.
 On the bright side, the latest data show that pay is on the rise in the city: the average weekly earnings in New York were $1,104, up 4.7 percent from October 2010. That jump followed a 3.7 percent rise in September.
 Statewide, the unemployment rate declined to 7.9 percent from 8 percent in September. The official unemployment rate does not account for people who have become so discouraged that they have given up looking for work. All told, there were about 750,000 unemployed residents of New York State in October, though only 405,000 collected unemployment benefits. The others either had exhausted all of the available unemployment insurance or were ineligible to collect it for some other reason.

HEADLINE: The Life Report: D.R.G.

BYLINE: DAVID BROOKS


HIGHLIGHT: The life reports are in. 

 BODY:
I was born to Italian American parents whose life never amounted to anything. Dad was a drinker and a gambler. My mother had some common sense somewhat restricted by her parochial views of the world plus the fact that she was brought up by her grandmother who had been born in the 1860's. In addition to all that she also had some physical constraints.
I was thrust into responsibility a lot sooner than most because Mom had to go work to keep us afloat financially - so at age 13 I ended up becoming the housekeeper and the caregiver of my brother who was 5 years younger than I.
I learned the most important lesson of life from my parents - namely, what I definitely did want to become.
College was never a consideration for me - my parents were of the opinion that girls did not need to attend. In 1959, I went from High School right to a job as a stenographer and contributed half of my paycheck to the "house" to chip in towards expenses - it was what was expected.
When I was 19 years old I met a handsome young man whose troublesome journey in life had left him a bit in disarray. Neither of us had any money nor any family backup. But we definitely had a meeting of the minds -maybe it was the Italian heritage that we shared. And, even after he left for California to live there for a year, he returned only to find that our thoughts and hearts were still very much in synch. We decided to marry. But it took us 2 years to prepare for the event because I had personal debt to pay off (what else would you expect - given the fact that my parents were my role models?) and I insisted on having a traditional wedding - which, of course, we had to pay for by ourselves. My parents were pretty disgruntled at the thought of my leaving to marry - mainly because of the loss of their financial subsidy.
It was 1963 when we wed. Neither of us had college degrees - my husband was a truck driver and I was a stenographer. He, having been born in Italy, brought with him a strong sense of conservatism regarding money - a sense that I severely lacked (however, have since embraced). We decided that we would live only on his salary and put all of my earnings into a savings account. Even though my paycheck was $95 gross a week, the money added up rather quickly and very soon we were able to purchase a home. It was not a traditional single family home that we purchased instead it was what is known in our area as a "triple decker". This meant that there were 3 apartments - one in which we would live and two others to rent out and thereby defray our cost of living. It worked out beautifully! More savings!
In 1965 we started a family. I had had a miscarriage a year earlier however, but afterwards our first child arrived without any problems. Sixteen months later a second child arrived and before the first one was 4 years old - the third child arrived. Whew! three kids in less than 4 years certainly took its toll - on me especially! At the time there was not much available in the way of contraception and the Catholic Church's posture was to use only "rhythm" or abstinence.
My husband hated his job as a truck driver and this created an extremely difficult decision for him - how to make a job change. Given the fact that we had 3 kids to provide for - (no backup for any financial difficulties - aka family) - and a stay at home wife, he definitely needed to think through how to go about changing his job. He took a civil service test and was able to join the City Fire Department as a firefighter where he would spend the next 20+ years before retiring.
At this same time (late 1960's) school integration was making its debut. Kids were being bused miles away from their local neighborhoods to attend school. Our first child was about to enter kindergarten. We did not want to be involved in this racial strife so we decided to move from the city to the suburbs. Real estate had been kind to us - giving us the ability to sell a couple of "triple deckers" at a profit each time. In a pricey suburb we actually found a "takeover" mortgage that belonged to a little ranch that was for sale. We all managed to fit inside the home and - then a fourth child arrived despite the fact that I had had an IUD device installed - specifically the Dalkon Shield (later found to be very high risk to both child and mother).
My neighbor had encouraged me to have this device inserted into my uterus. It was a new carefree concept at the time on how to prevent pregnancy. I could not afford to go to her doctor who was a "specialist" and very expensive. So I contacted a local GYN (not a Catholic) and made the appointment - this was in December. By the following February, you can guess what happened. I was pregnant! Then the doctor informed me that the device was only 98% effective, however I was not just 2% pregnant. By relying on someone else's advice and against my own convictions, the end result was that I felt like the world had caved in around me. But always being up for any challenge, I had no choice - so I embraced the onset of another life to care for. The blessing of it all was that I ended up having my first "natural" childbirth and even breastfed this child - another first. From something that I would not have chosen to do, it turned out to be very positive. I knew that I could and would make it all work.
By now, the "pill" had become readily available. But, I, with my Roman Catholic upbringing shunned the use of it. To prevent any further additions to our family, my husband chose to have a vasectomy. There - problem solved! Next on the agenda: Eliminate from my life all those Roman Catholic religious teachings!
Living in this suburb we began rubbing elbows with upscale folks - most of whom were college graduates with earnings greater than ours and on an upwardly mobile trajectory. They were very interesting folks - able to discuss current/world events and present thought provoking pro/con ideas, i.e. Vietnam War etc. This was novel to me given where I had come from. But, instead of letting all of this make me feel inferior, I challenged myself to become better than I was. I was like a sponge - soaking in everything around me and wanting to learn and trying to make up for any shortcomings I knew I had. I signed up at the local library for a discussion group called "Great Books of the Western World". I was very timid at the meetings - did not have a lot of input to give to the discussions - but I attended faithfully. More learning! And, with 4 children under the age of 7 - it was a real challenge not only just to read the book but then to get myself there - I LOVED every minute of it!
By now I had become exposed to other faiths - mainly Protestants - I had already met Jews in the workplace when I started my first job. The Jews were an impressive bunch - well heeled and affluent. Growing up where I did there had been no Protestants and they were different than we were - some were teetotalers - had never met one before. They were very sociable and quite open armed about including newcomers to their circle -maybe proselytizing? We voluntarily and happily accepted their invitation. Yet another learning experience for us - and our children.
As I previously mentioned, real estate had been good to us providing a windfall of profit with each sale and so we moved a couple of more times - always within the same town and to a house better than the one before. Our kids settled in - going to the good schools of our town and doing all the activities available to them.
I had been a stay-at-home mom up until my 40th birthday. My husband had been working 2 full time jobs - the fire department on a rotating schedule and a small business he had created. I not only wanted to "bust out" of my present role - I needed to!
I got a job at a major bank in the city as a secretary. I also joined the League of Women Voters. I was encouraged by some of my peers to run for Town Clerk - which I did - only to lose by 150 votes. Oh well, all of it had been a lot of fun and I got to meet a lot of people everywhere in town. No regrets there.
About 3 years later I got laid off from the downtown bank. While collecting unemployment, I met a friend who suggested that I look into an opportunity to become a Loan Originator of mortgage loans for a very small, privately owned bank that was expanding into my area. I had never heard of such a job! A mortgage originator - what? Once you got a mortgage - didn't you just pay it off within 30 years?
Well off I went. Took the challenge head on and just retired 2-1/2 years ago after a 23 year career! It was such a wonderful employment in many ways. I was able to help many people become home owners by guiding them through the maze of mortgage financing. I embraced all the challenges that the job offered. I became a true professional - thriving on referral and repeat business. I had a standing in the corporate world. I won many awards and honors over the years. Having been shut out of the college experience - I was absorbing any and all of the surrounding culture and enjoying all of it. My husband had furthered himself along in his career into a more professional aspect of the fire department and his business had evolved into environmental consulting.
I was compensated well for my hard work and diligent efforts as a Loan Officer and was able to pay for each of my 4 children's college expenses - I am proud of the fact that none of my kids had any student loans at the end of their college commitment. And by living frugally I was still able to save money too! Together as a couple we continuously kept moving onward and upward. We moved to a prestigious house at a fashionable address. And, in addition from the sale of a piece or property that gave us a windfall of cash, we now were able to own a second home at the ocean's edge.
But , the old real estate syndrome of selling for a profit was biting at us again - so we sold the trophy house- at triple what we had paid for it! What an amazing coup! Our plan had been to pay cash for the next one and be debt free, but our investment "adviser" suggested we put the money into the "market". He said that we could earn more from our investments than what the new place was going to cost us. I liked what he said and I threw caution to the wind. My biggest regret in life - I listened to him. When the "bubble" burst - I had lost more than half of all our money. I have to share in the blame along with the "adviser" and my husband. Greed was rampant everywhere at the time and no one ever thought that things would eventually stop going up!
So, now as I enter the 7th decade of life I have had to embrace some belt-tightening again at this late stage of the game. Oh well, I have been there before so it does not feel that strange to me. As I always have, I accept the challenge and know in my heart that I will be able to make it work - even if it means reinventing my self completely.
My life so far has been a very full and dynamic one - certainly not a "charmed" life but a good life - a full life! I don't mention any of the heartaches - I treat those as if they were a toothache that once it has subsided -I cannot remember any more how it felt.
I have been married for 48 years to my best friend and confidant. We enjoy and share many of the same things. We have raised a fine family. We have four beautiful grandchildren. We have lots of wonderful friends.
Life is good.

HEADLINE: Clashes and More Than 240 Arrests on Protest's 'Day of Action'

BYLINE: ANDY NEWMAN


HIGHLIGHT: At least 240 people were detained and more than 15 officers and civilians were injured as protesters tried to delay the opening of the stock exchange, confronted officers in Zuccotti Park and staged a sit-in at the base of the Brooklyn Bridge. 

 BODY:
Two months after it began in New York, Occupy Wall Street carried out a "Day of Action" on Thursday featuring an attempt to delay the opening of the New York Stock Exchange, demonstrations on the subways, a sit-in in the roadway at the base of the Brooklyn Bridge and unscheduled clashes with the police in Zuccotti Park that left a protester with a bloodied face and an officer with a lacerated hand. 
More than 240 people were arrested, five protesters were charged with felony assault, and seven officers and 10 protesters were injured, the police said. 
Outside the stock exchange, officers swung batons at protesters who crowded the streets. At Zuccotti Park, protesters briefly removed barricades that had been placed there since Tuesday to create checkpoints at the park. 
See latest developments below. And click for more photos from Thursday's demonstrations. 
11:02 P.M. | Labor Leaders Arrested
Among those arrested at the base of the Brooklyn Bridge early Thursday evening was the city's top labor leader and the president of the nationwide Service Employees International Union, according to a union spokeswoman.
The labor leader, George Gresham, the president of 1199 S.E.I.U. United Healthcare Workers East, and the president of the S.E.I.U., Mary Kay Henry, were arrested along with Kevin Doyle, the executive vice president of S.E.I.U. 32BJ.
Wearing white shirts emblazoned with "99%," the three were among a group of 99 people who staged the sit-in at about 6 p.m. said the spokeswoman, Leah Gonzalez of S.E.I.U. United Healthcare Workers East.
They will most likely be charged with disorderly conduct, the police said. As of late Thursday, they had not been released.
- 
7:09 P.M. | Bloodied Protester Charged With Attempted Assault
A protester who was led out of Zuccotti Park on Thursday afternoon with blood streaming from his face had thrown a small battery at police officers and taken a deputy inspector's hat, the police said. He was charged with attempted assault and grand larceny.
The police said the man identified himself as Brandon Watts, 20, and has been arrested at least four times since the Occupy Wall Street demonstrations began.
The police offered this account of Mr. Watts's confrontation:
Mr. Watts climbed up on a wall inside Zuccotti Park and began throwing objects at officers outside the barricade along Liberty Street, starting with pieces of a plastic pen. He then threw a AAA battery, and motioned to officers that he was ready to fight. The officers ignored him. 
Mr. Watts went up to the officers, grabbed the barrier between him and them and began pushing and kicking it, shoving it against the officers. Mr. Watts grabbed a deputy inspector's hat and ran back into the park. The officers ran after him. He resisted arrest, kicking officers, and when he was brought down, he struck his head, causing bleeding. He was taken to Bellevue Hospital Center, where he was treated but not admitted.
Mr. Watts's prior arrests at Occupy Wall Street, the police said, involved resisting arrest on Sept. 24, loitering in disguise on Sept. 28, escaping from a prisoner van on Oct. 14 and having stolen orange mesh fencing on Oct. 28.
- 
6:40 P.M. | In an Endless Stream, Protesters March Across Bridge
After looping around City Hall Park, a long line of protesters that appeared to number in the thousands streamed onto the pedestrian walkway of the Brooklyn Bridge and began crossing the East River. Many carried candles, and the mood was relatively quiet. 
The scene was a sharp contrast from Oct. 1, when more than 700 protesters were arrested after they marched in the roadway on the bridge, blocking car traffic.
- 
6:22 P.M. | Scores More Arrested at Foot of Brooklyn Bridge
Around 5:50 p.m., the police said, 64 protesters were arrested after they sat down in the roadway in a coordinated action at the base of the Brooklyn Bridge. They included City Councilman Jumaane D. Williams.
The protesters, all wearing white "99 percent" T-shirts, marched toward the bridge from the rally at Foley Square, about two blocks north, and sat down in the roadway at Centre Street at the entrance to the bridge, blocking traffic and chanting "All day, all week, Occupy Wall Street."
After a few minutes, the police moved toward them. The protesters all stood at the same time and submitted to being peacefully arrested. They filled two school-bus-sized buses parked at the base of the bridge.
- 
6:15 P.M. | Thousands Rally at Foley Square
Thousands of protesters and union members converged on Foley Square beginning at 5 p.m., with the crowd spilling into a nearby park, to commemorate the passage of two months since the occupation of Zuccotti Park began.
Highlighted by repeated chants of "We are the 99 percent," the gathering also featured speakers from union groups and a hip-hop concert for visitors. 
At one point, protesters broke through barricades surrounding the sculpture in the raised center of the square, but the police did not take action in response.
As demonstrators left the square and began marching toward the Brooklyn Bridge, some protesters tried to push out the barricades separating Foley Square from the street and officers pushed back and maintained the barricade line. 
Laurel Sturt, 55, who teaches elementary school at Public School 91 in the Bronx, said she expected a larger crowd, but lauded the day's proceedings as a victory for the demonstrators.
"It's magnificent," she said, looking out on the crowd gathered beside a speaker system. "All great movements of the past started like this."
- 
5:10 P.M. | Former Philadelphia Police Captain Among Those Arrested
One of those arrested on Thursday was a retired Philadelphia police captain, Ray Lewis, who has been taking part in the demonstrations in uniform. Mr. Lewis says that the police are being exploited by the richest 1 percent, The Associated Press reports.
4:44 P.M. | Occupying the Subways, To Mixed Reception
When Michelle Rodriguez said she was surprised how few protesters showed up at the Broadway Junction station in Brownsville, Brooklyn, Thursday afternoon, a demonstrator beside her offered an explanation. 
"This isn't exactly the most glamorous part of New York nor the most accessible," said Rosalie Harman, a middle aged Canarsie resident, "but this is the community that needs to hear it."
Broadway Junction was one of 16 stations on Occupy Wall Street's afternoon itinerary during its "Day of Action." 
At 3 p.m. on the platform, five protesters handed out fliers to a bustling, seemingly uninterested crowd. Upstairs, a larger group used the movement's signature call-and-repeat "People's Mic" technique to tell travelers who they were and why they were there. A number of curious passersby paused to watch, including a few giggling teenage girls who sang along.
Jesus Verde, 25, of Bushwick, who held a child in his arms, said he wished he could join the protesters. "I would do it, but I have to be with my baby all the time," he said.
Charles Garment, a forensic coordinator for Brooklyn mental health court, said that he, too, would like to protest, but that he couldn't "take a chance with going to jail."
But a recent St Louis transplant, Lindsey Leonard, groaned at the protesters' cheers as they boarded the train to Manhattan.
"They claim they're the 99 percent, but I'm the 51 percent that works three jobs," she said. "I didn't move to this town to protest." At the same time, she said of the protest, "It's beautiful. It's freedom."
Outside another station, the 23rd Street stop on the C train in Chelsea, a lone woman held an "occupy all streets" sign outside as straphangers walked by. 
The that on a train bound for Times Square, about a dozen demonstrators told their stories to fellow passengers. One described her work in low-income communities where people lack access to healthy food options. Another spoke of how he had to move in with his parents because he could not find a job.

4:22 P.M. | Mayor: 'Some Protesters Have Pursued Violence'
At a news conference at Bellevue Hospital Center, where an officer was being treated for a lacerated hand suffered at Zuccotti Park, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said that five of the protesters arrested on Thursday have been charged with felony assault and that seven police officers and 10 protesters were injured. 
"Unfortunately, some protesters today have deliberately pursued violence," the mayor said. There have been 177 arrests so far, Mr. Kelly said.
The seven injured officers, the mayor and commissioner said, included Officer Matthew Walters, 24, a one-year veteran of the force who needed 20 stitches to his left hand after a protester threw a star-shaped glass object at him as the police were trying to stop protesters from removing barricades at Zuccotti Park; four officers who had a liquid, possibly vinegar, thrown at their faces, causing a burning sensation; and an officer who sustained a minor hand injury near the stock exchange. 
The mayor said that a witness told CNN that during a faceoff in Zuccotti Park, protesters tried to provoke officers by flicking lit cigarettes at them. 
"Even in the face of this antagonism, the police maintained incredible restraint," Mr. Bloomberg said.
Mr. Kelly added, "I think some people are intent on being arrested."
The mayor reiterated that the city would "ensure that everyone has a right to exercise their First Amendment rights," but added, "make no mistake: if anyone's actions cross the line and threaten the health and safety of others, including our first responders, we will respond accordingly."
The mayor added that the number of people in the streets was far fewer than the many thousands Occupy Wall Street organizers had predicted would take part in the movement's "Day of Action." "The real story for tomorrow morning's paper was there were just not that many people out here," the mayor said.
Mr. Kelly said that as far he knew, all the injured protesters were treated for their injuries and released. He was asked if he was disappointed about the way events have unfolded. "Why would I be disappointed?" he said. "We are doing our jobs."
The Police Department's overtime tab for the protests has reached $8 million, said the head police spokesman, Paul J. Browne.

3:42 P.M. | Protesters at Subways, But Not Shutting Them Down
Occupy Wall Street's "Day of Action" is taking protesters to subway stations all over the city this afternoon. But contrary to reports on the New York Fox affiliate and elsewhere, there do not seem to be plans to shut down the subways, Brian Stelter reports on Media Decoder.
Shortly after 3 p.m. at one of the stations on the itinerary, Broadway Junction in Brooklyn, the protest consisted of about five people handing out fliers. Most riders did not take them. In Manhattan, a large crowd was marching up Broadway toward Union Square.

3:21 P.M. | New Arrest Total: 175. Injured Officer at Bellevue.
The total number of people arrested Thursday now stands at about 175, the police said. 
They include a man who threw a star-shaped glass object at an officer at Zuccotti Park, causing lacerations to the officer's hand, and a protester who threw a liquid, possibly vinegar, in the face of four officers in a morning confrontation near the stock exchange, the police said. 
The officer with the cut hand was taken to Bellevue Hospital Center, where Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg will hold a news conference at 3:40 p.m. to discuss the officer's injuries. 
Earlier in the day, the police confiscated about a dozen metal devices comprised of metal sleeves welded together and designed to accommodate people who planned to lock themselves to the entrances of Wall Street businesses, said Paul J. Browne, the head police spokesman. Some of the devices were found along the route of the protest march, and others were confiscated in a truck stop early this morning. None were actually used.

2:54 P.M. | Video Roundup of Thursday Protests
2:20 P.M. | Officer Cut in Hand With Glass by Protester
Shortly before 2 p.m., a police officer was cut in the hand by a protester wielding a piece of glass, possibly a broken bottle, near Zuccotti Park, the police said. The assailant is in custody, they said.
An emergency medical technician said the officer, whose nameplate said "Walters," had lacerations on his left hand and would probably need about 20 stitches. 
- 
1:58 P.M. | More Confrontations, and a Bloodied Protester, at Zuccotti Park
A brief clash in Zuccotti Park around 1:35 p.m. ended with a protester led out with blood streaming down his face. Witnesses, including a Reuters photographer, said the protester had flicked the hat off the head of an officer standing just outside the barricades at the edge of the park, then run off into the crowd in the park. 
Police officers flooded into the park and roughly cleared all the protesters out of the park's center, forcing them to the edges of the park. 
Jo Robin, 29, a protester from New Orleans, said that officers tackled the man in front of her. 
"First there were three, then six, then nine," she said. "They were beating his head on the ground."
She said the man tried to give onlookers his name but was brought out of the park by officers as a stream of blood poured from his forehead.

There was a puddle of what appeared to be blood on the ground in the park. "That's our blood," protesters chanted.
After clearing out the middle of the park, the officers withdrew, with many protesters following behind them jeering, "Leave our park."
- 
12:41 P.M. | At a Lull in the Action, Pizza and Confusion
By 12:30, the barricades were back up around Zuccotti Park and protesters were being funneled in single file as before. The chaos had subsided enough for the protesters to order a large number of pizzas: 
@OccupyWallStNYC #OCCUPYWALLSTREET
Here at @liberatospizza, more than 300 pizzas ordered! We're bringing first 40 to #libertysquare in 15 minutes. Come 2 entrance w/ cams!
Thu Nov 17 17:30:43 via #OCCUPYWALLSTREET
But people strolling the streets a few blocks south of the park encountered confusing situations, sometimes being hemmed in on Broadway by police barricades manned by helmeted officers, who sometimes gave contradictory orders, directing pedestrians to move but sometimes not providing egress.
At one point on Broadway, near Wall Street, men in suits and overcoats resorted to clambering over a metal police barricade or ducking through a barricade missing some of its rails. All the while, bands of protesters milled on those streets, marching north and south, waving flags and chanting.
- 
11:20 A.M. | Protesters Yank Barricades at Park. Some Are Arrested.
Around 11 a.m., hundreds of protesters streamed into Zuccotti Park, shoving aside barricades and flowing into the granite expanse that they had been ousted from on Tuesday. They chanted "our park" and lifted barricades in the air near Cedar Street.
Since Tuesday, the park had been surrounded by metal police barricades with one or two entrances that were monitored by police officers and private security working for Brookfield Office Properties, the park's owner.
But when a crowd of several hundred people arrived at the park after the stock exchange march, they did not use those entrances. Instead protesters grabbed barricades, first on the south side of the park, then on the north side, and slid them away, clearing a wide area.
By 11:15 a.m., perhaps a thousand people filled the park, standing on benches and milling about. 
A line of police officers wielding batons pushed into the crowd near Cedar Street. After a moment those officers were directed backward by Joseph J. Esposito, the chief of the department. 
But before Chief Esposito directed the police back, several officers could be seen shoving and punching protesters and journalists. 
A line of helmeted police officers formed a cordon along the south side of the park, holding in place those barricades that had not been moved by the crowd. Columns of officers filled Cedar Street, equipped with wooden batons and handcuffs. Officers could be seen leading people down that street who had been cuffed behind their backs.
- 
10:15 A.M. | Scores of Arrests Near Stock Exchange
At the stock exchange in the early morning, many members of the group pushed through lines formed by police, waving signs and banging drums as they moved. The police started taking protesters into custody who had sat down on the street about a block away from the exchange.
"Sidewalk!" an officer shouted, shoving a protester out of the road. 
Another protester held a sign nearby: "Tear down this Wall Street." The demonstrators and the large deployment of police officers snarled traffic on streets around the exchange.
Protesters chanted, "We are the 99" and "We aren't afraid of your nightsticks."
Protesters had vowed to prevent traders from reaching the stock exchange on Wall Street, and some traders did appear to have a hard time reaching the building. But the stock exchange opened for trading as usual at 9:30 a.m. 
About 10 a.m., Paul J. Browne, the Police Department's chief spokesman, said "there are probably between 50 and 60 arrests." Most were in the street at Nassau and Pine streets, he said. 
One of the more intense confrontations took place before 10 a.m. near the intersection of Broad Street and Beaver Street, where a few hundred people had gathered, dancing and chanting and brandishing black umbrellas. 
A line of police officers surged into the crowd, shoving protesters to the sidewalk, grabbing some and hurling them to the ground, and using long batons to strike others with overhand blows. Officers then walked up Beaver Street pushing the crowd back. Many of the protesters moved around the corner joining another group sitting in a circle, at the intersection of William Street and Exchange Place. 
About 8:30 a.m. at the corner of Nassau and Pine Streets, about 300 people stood and sat in the intersection waving flags and singing. A few minutes later, a police officer announced through a megaphone: "You're obstructing vehicle traffic. If you don't leave the street, you'll be subject to arrest."
At Pearl and Wall Streets, there were some arrests as the police tried to keep the streets sidewalks open for pedestrians. Most of the charges stemming from those arrests were for disorderly conduct and resisting arrest.
Many of those taken into custody were sitting in the street at the corner of Pine and William Streets, a block from the exchange, including one woman in a wheelchair who held an American flag. Cheers rose as two police vans filled with demonstrators drove away.

HEADLINE: Madoff Explains Everything

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Affinity fraud, everywhere. 

 BODY:
As i watch the politics swirl around the Occupy Wall Street movement, I find myself thinking about Bernie Madoff. Bear with me here; this might even make sense.
The Madoff affair, as you may know, was a classic case of "affinity fraud"; Madoff was able to gain the trust of wealthy Jews by persuading them that he was their kind of guy. Affinity fraud lies behind a lot of financial scams -- and it lies behind a lot of political scams too.
Right now, the campaign against OWS basically tries to get working Americans to turn on the movement, even though most people support the movement's goals, by trying to make it seem as if the protestors are people not like you -- whereas the plutocrats are. Hey, this has worked many times in the past; that's the whole point of "What's the matter with Kansas." And it can operate in many directions: OWS should be shunned because they're dirty hippies, Elizabeth Warren is not-like-you because, horrors, she's a Harvard professor.
And now that I think of it, the generalized theory of affinity fraud extends beyond politics to things like financial analysis. I've marveled now and then on this blog about the continued popularity on Wall Street of inflationistas, who have been wrong about everything. I suspect that a lot of it is that economists who issue dire warnings about deficits and money growth come across as the kind of people they'd like to hang out with at the golf course, whereas bearded professors don't.
So what to do? Within limits, one should try to allay unnecessary social dissonance. If you're going to have a demonstration on behalf of working Americans, can the drumming circles. The class warriors on the right want to convince people it's really a culture war, and you don't want to make their job easier.
But there are limits. No, I won't take up golf.

HIGHLIGHT: Highlights from the DealBook newsletter. 

 BODY:
With MF Global Money Still Missing, Suspicions Grow | Nearly three weeks after $600 million in customer money went missing from MF Global, the search for the cash has been hampered by the bankrupt brokerage firm's sloppy record-keeping, an increasingly worrisome situation that has left regulators frustrated and customers in the lurch.
The round-the-clock effort has consumed an alphabet soup of federal regulators and criminal investigators, with lawyers sleeping at open desks and each agency commandeering a different conference room at the firm's offices. But as authorities comb through some 38,000 customer accounts, they are growing more suspicious about what went wrong at MF Global, the commodities powerhouse once run by Jon S. Corzine, the former Democratic governor of New Jersey.
"The lost money is sort of like a lost child," said Bart Chilton, a Democratic member of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. "Every day that passes is more and more concerning, and there's less and less hope." DealBook

He criticized mortgage-backed securities as "toxic," but told Reuters that he didn't voice concerns when he worked in the financial industry. "I saw people I considered much smarter than I was, and they really believed in them, so I didn't open my mouth," he said. REUTERS
Side Effects May Include Recession | Worried about your exposure to European sovereign debt? Mother Jones has an advertisement for a new medication, known as ContagionEx, to clear up any trace of a "Sovereign Transmitted Debt."

HEADLINE: Opinion Report: Before It's Too Late

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: A summary of what's on today's editorial page. 

 BODY:
As the debt crisis persists in Europe, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany should tell her people the truth: The real threat to their country isn't inflation, but an economic collapse across the continent. She should support an all-out effort by the European Central Bank to buy bonds and lower interest rates.
Pressure is finally building against Syria, with King Abdullah of Jordan urging President Bashar al-Assad to relinquish power, and Turkey threatening to cut power lines. But the international community is still acting too slowly, and meanwhile the killing continues.
Senator Tom Coburn's new report "Subsidies of the Rich and Famous," is well worth reading. It argues convincingly that there's real revenue to be netted by cracking down on indefensible boons for the top tax brackets.
The public's right to learn what Penn State officials knew and when they knew it has been severely restricted by a provision exempting the school from an open records law.

HEADLINE: Welcome to the News Business, Ms. Clinton

BYLINE: CLYDE HABERMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The Day: When Chelsea Clinton started working at NBC News, she had to be the most untrained and least experienced new reporter at a major network since, oh, Jenna Bush Hager. Also, what City Room is reading in other newspapers and blogs. 

 BODY:
If ever a development was bound to create jealousy and an urge to ridicule, it was the announcement the other day that Chelsea Clinton started working at NBC News as a special correspondent. She had to be the most untrained and least experienced new hire by a major network since, oh, since NBC in 2009 made Jenna Bush Hager, another presidential daughter with questionable credentials, a correspondent on its "Today" show. 
 Sure enough, there was a stream of jaundiced assessments on Twitter, comments to the effect that merit is dead and that it's nice to be well-born. But sympathetic notes were struck, too, like that from one fellow who said it must be rough "to have everyone presume every job one gets is a byproduct of privilege." 
 You might have thought - we did, anyway - that resentment would bubble at the city's major journalism schools. There, students shell out thousands upon thousands of dollars a year to be trained in a craft that often leads to first jobs paying less than their tuition fees. Surely, people at those schools were fuming that Ms. Clinton could just waltz in and land an on-air role with NBC's "Making a Difference" series. 
 If you thought that, you were wrong. We certainly were. 
 The prevailing attitude was that you'd have to be awfully naive not to know that life isn't always fair, that the well-connected connect well and that television is smitten with celebrity. But it does not automatically mean that Ms. Clinton, 31, can't hold her own. "I'd cut her some slack," said Stephen B. Shepard, dean of the Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York. 
 Besides, Mr. Shepard said, his graduates have done quite well at landing jobs, including with the networks. Similar points were made by those who guide journalism programs at Columbia University and New York University. 
 Given the shabby economy, students have "a lot of anxiety" about their prospects, said Dr. Perri Klass, director of N.Y.U.'s Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute. "But they continue to get jobs and produce stories, and they continue to want to do it," Dr. Klass said. 
 Ann Cooper, director of the broadcast program at Columbia's Graduate School of Journalism, offered an impressive list of positions in television that former students have landed. None have gone directly from the classroom to "a high-profile, on-air job" like Ms. Clinton's, Ms. Cooper said. All the same, she said, "our broadcast grads do very well." 
 For the dean of the Columbia school, Nicholas Lemann, the issue isn't how someone with a resume as slender as Ms. Clinton's could land so plum a spot.
 "To my mind, the real story here is big news organizations creating a special subcategory of feel-good news," Mr. Lemann said. NBC's "Making a Difference" is but one example. With such segments, he said, "a whole different and softer set of journalistic rules applies, including but not limited to whom they hire." 
 Well, Ms. Clinton, now that you are a comrade in arms, we have some advice for you. What it takes to be a television talent is beyond our grasp, but there is a paramount rule that applies to any journalistic endeavor: Never do your expense account when you're in a good mood; it can only work against you. That's important for even a well-to-do Clinton to remember. 
 One more thing: If this TV gig doesn't work out, but you remain keen on journalism, there are other opportunities. Newspapers still have life in them, and local papers are good starting points. Indeed, there is an established weekly covering a couple of neighborhoods on the West Side of Manhattan that you might consider. It's called Chelsea Clinton News.

HEADLINE: Solyndra Has a Cousin in the Poorhouse

BYLINE: MATTHEW L. WALD


HIGHLIGHT: Steven Chu, the energy secretary, compared the market misfortunes of Beacon Power, a manufacturer of mechanical batteries, with the price decline that undid Solyndra. 

 BODY:
At a hearing on Thursday that lasted five and half hours, Republicans on the House Energy and Commerce Committee grilled the energy secretary, Steven Chu, on the bankruptcy of the solar panel manufacturer Solyndraand asked what other loan recipients might be in financial trouble. 
Dr. Chu named only one other company, Beacon Power, which borrowed $39 million and entered bankruptcy late last month. 
In remarks to reporters after the hearing, Dr. Chu lumped the two companies together, although they were in different lines of business. Solyndra, based in Cupertino, Calif., built solar power modules for rooftops, and Beacon built an array of flywheels at a plant near Stephentown, N.Y. The flywheels are mechanical batteries designed to absorb power or give it back on signals from theNew York power grid operator; they were capable of reversing direction every four seconds. 
Their purpose is to help regulate the frequency on the grid so that the electrons dance back and forth precisely 60 times every second, which is the alternation in "alternating current," or AC power.
Solyndra received a loan guarantee of $535 million and built just what it promised to build. But on the world market, the price of its products fell by 70 percent over two and a half years, Dr. Chu testified, because the Chinese government had subsidized so many manufacturers in that country and because the Europeans, struggling with money problems, had slowed their purchases.
Beacon was also a technical success, according to the company. But the price paid for the service it provided, frequency regulation, fell by about 70 percent in the last year. 
The reason is that this price, too, is market-based. Gene Hunt, a spokesman for the company, said that Beacon was a victim of the recession, which has hurt demand for electricity among industries. "It's kind of a perfect storm," he said. The same cliche has been used to describe what happened to Solyndra.
Dr. Chu, speaking in a hallway outside the hearing room in a House of Representatives office building in Washington, said the "market changed very, very rapidly, just as the photovoltaic market changed very rapidly." And among the approximately three dozen other loan recipients, "I can't promise you there won't be another'' with the same problem, he said. 
Analysts have noted that the Energy Department has made extensive loans and grants to companies that want to produce batteries and other components for electric cars or entire cars. If that market does not develop, batteries will be in oversupply and their price will crash, the analysts say. But backers of electric cars still have high hopes for a major market. 
Solyndra is being liquidated. Beacon is still operating and has earned about $600,000 in revenue in the last year, Mr. Hunt said. The company has asked the bankruptcy court for access to an escrow fund that it placed with the Energy Department in exchange for its loan. A bankruptcy court in Delaware is scheduled to hold a hearing on Friday.

HEADLINE: Why Not Break Up Citigroup?

BYLINE: SIMON JOHNSON


HIGHLIGHT: No credible argument has been made to allow mega-banks to remain mega, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Earlier this week, Richard Fisher, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, captured the growing political mood with regard to very large banks, observing, "I believe that too-big-to-fail banks are too dangerous to permit." 
Market forces don't work with the biggest banks at their current sizes, because they have great political power and receive almost unlimited, implicit subsidies in the form of protection against downside risks - particularly in times like these, with Europe's financial situation looking precarious. Mr. Fisher added: 
Downsizing the behemoths over time into institutions that can be prudently managed and regulated across borders is the appropriate policy response. Then, creative destruction can work its wonders in the financial sector, just as it does elsewhere in our economy.
Mr. Fisher is a senior public official and also someone with a great deal of experience in financial markets, including running his own funds-management company. I increasingly meet leading figures in the financial sector who share Mr. Fisher's views, at least in private.

What, then, is the case in favor of keeping mega-banks at their current scale? Vague assertions are sometimes made, but there is very little hard evidence and often a lack of candor on that side of the argument. 
So it is refreshing to see Vikram Pandit, the chief executive of Citigroup, go on the record with The Banker magazine to at least explain how his bank will generate shareholder value. (Viewing the interview requires registration, however.)
Citi is one of the world's largest banks. According to The Banker's database, which includes data from the end of 2010, it had total assets of just under $2 trillion - putting it in the top 10 worldwide. Over all, The Banker places it as No. 4 in its "Top 1,000 World Ranking." Citi is No. 39 on the Forbes list of the top 500 global companies, with total employment of 260,000.
Is there indication in Mr. Pandit's vision that mega-banking will be good for the rest of us in the future? Don't look for Citi to drive any kind of rethinking of the consumer market in the United States; Mr. Pandit just wants to downsize that part of his business.
The engines of growth, Mr. Pandit said, will be "the global transactions services business" and "emerging markets."
Transaction services are important, but they do not require a very large balance sheet; these can equally well be performed by a network of small, nimble financial firms. Global commerce existed for centuries before banks built up risks that are large relative to their home economies.
And emerging markets are risky. Mr. Pandit is essentially betting that Citi can ride the cycle in those countries. Probably there will be relatively good profits for a number of years, and this will justify high compensation levels. But when the cycle turns against emerging markets, as it did in 1982, what happens? 
In 1982, Citi had a large loan exposure in the emerging markets of the day - Latin America, and the Communist nations of Poland and Romania - and it was saved from insolvency by "regulatory forbearance," meaning that the Federal Reserve and other regulators did not force it to recognize its losses. Citi was a relatively big bank at that time, but much smaller than it is today.
And its complex global operations are exactly what would make it very hard to put through orderly liquidation under Dodd-Frank. I argued here in March that there is no meaningful resolution authority for global banks; before and after that post I've taken this point up in private with senior officials in the United States and Europe responsible for handling the potential failure of such entities. 
No one disagrees with my main point: we cannot handle the collapse of a bank like Citigroup in "orderly" fashion.
Jon Huntsman put mega-banks on the agenda for the Republican primaries, with a blistering commentary in The Wall Street Journal a few weeks ago: "Too Big to Fail Is Simply Too Big." 
Other contenders for the Republican nomination have followed his lead, including most recently Newt Gingrich. Whoever ends up going head to head with Mitt Romney is likely to make good use of this very theme - because Mr. Romney already has so much financial support from the top of Wall Street, it will be very hard for him to respond effectively.
Breaking up the biggest banks is not a fringe idea to be brushed off. Mr. Fisher is speaking for many people who work in financial services, who agree that the big banks are not good for the rest of us. Mr. Pandit's interview just reinforces this point.
Any Republican candidates who say they are fiscally responsible must eventually confront this issue: What was the role of big banks in the enormous recession and consequent vast loss of tax revenue since 2008? Which sector poses clear and immediate danger to our fiscal accounts, looking forward - and in a way that is not yet scored properly in any budget assessment? As Mr. Fisher put it, rather graphically,
Perhaps the financial equivalent of irreversible lap-band or gastric bypass surgery is the only way to treat the pathology of financial obesity, contain the relentless expansion of these banks and downsize them to manageable proportions.
I suggest that Mr. Fisher could reasonably begin with Citigroup.

HEADLINE: The Early Word: China

BYLINE: ASHLEY SOUTHALL


HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times, plus a look at what's happening in Washington. 

 BODY:
In Today's Times:
The Obama administration is building a permanent military presence in Australia, an effort to counter China's rapidly rising influence in the Pacific region that underscores Washington's wariness toward Beijing, Jackie Calmes reports.
With a week to go before the joint deficit panel's deadline to submit its recommendations for shaving more than $1 trillion from the deficit, Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the Republican majority leader, hasn't weighed in on a Republican proposal that includes tax increases. Jennifer Steinhauer and Robert Pear note that Mr. Cantor isn't the quiet type and his opinion could greatly ease or complicate the passage of a deal.
Retaking the Senate from Democrats is a tantalizing goal for Republicans but they are having considerable trouble recruiting strong candidates, resolving intra-arty differences and raising money, Ms. Steinhauer writes.
Congress on Wednesday sent President Obama two bits of his jobs bill for signing, after the Republican-led House passed a measure that would repeal a tax withholding requirement on government contractors and provide tax incentives for companies that hire veterans, Ms. Steinhauer reports. Republicans are calling on the president to hold a public signing ceremony and invite some of them to showcase the rare bipartisan agreement.
SOLAR When Energy Secretary Stephen Chu testifies Thursday before the House Energy and Commerce Committee, he will defend the program that loaned $535 billion to a solar-panel maker that went bankrupt against its Republican critics, Matt Wald reports.
John Broder examines how President Obama's re-election interests have influenced his recent decisions on environmental policies. 
Charlie Savage and Mark Landler report that authorities have arrested a 21-year-old Idaho man suspected of firing a semi-automatic rifle at the White House on Friday night. The suspect, Oscar Ramiro Ortega-Hernandez, is charged with a felony count of carrying a deadly weapon.
Happening in Washington:
At 8:30 a.m., the Census Bureau releases housing starts for October and the Department of Labor releases weekly unemployment insurance claims.
At 10, Freddie Mac releases weekly mortgage rates.
At 2 p.m., members of the "Tea Party Debt Commission" will discuss the final findings of their report.

HEADLINE: Republican Ads Turn More Aggressive

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: As the Republican presidential candidates begin to turn their attention to the airwaves, two strategies are emerging: attack your rivals or attack the president. 

 BODY:
As the Republican presidential candidates begin to turn their attention to the airwaves in the final six weeks before voting begins, two strategies are starting to become clear.
Representatives Michele Bachmann of Minnesota and Ron Paul of Texas have decided that their paths to the nomination require direct attacks on their Republican rivals. 
Ms. Bachmann's latest television ad is a fast-paced montage of her rivals' most politically unpopular moments - expressing weakness toward America's enemies and stating their support for abortion rights, illegal immigration, climate change and gun control. She even highlights Rick Perry's "oops" moment.
"Don't settle," the ad concludes.
Mr. Paul has been broadcasting a similar ad that shows his rivals expressing support for economic stimulus and bailout plans - two positions that are likely to be extremely unpopular with conservative voters.
"Who will lead?" his ad asks.
But not all of the candidates view that approach as the right one. Mr. Perry, who is burning through his cash with television ads in an effort to rescue his presidential campaign, has decided - at least for now - that voters would rather see him attacking someone else.
Specifically: President Obama.
In a new ad with a razor-sharp tone, Mr. Perry takes on the president, not his Republican rivals. Speaking directly to the camera, Mr. Perry, the governor of Texas, slams Mr. Obama for a recent comment suggesting that Americans are "lazy."
"Can you believe that? That's what our president thinks is wrong with America," Mr. Perry says. "That's pathetic. It's time to clean house in Washington."
He adds that Mr. Obama's "socialist policies are bankrupting America. We must stop him now."
The differing advertising strategies reflect the uncertainty that has characterized the Republican campaign for months, as members of the unsettled field have tried to break through with negative attacks without alienating voters. 
During the early debates, the Republican candidates largely took the safe route -- avoiding direct attacks on each other and trying instead to outdo their rivals with aggressive one-liners about Mr. Obama.
"We need a new president to end the Obama Depression," Newt Gingrich, the former speaker of the House, declared in the first debate in June.
Several debates later, as Mitt Romney solidified his lead, several of the candidates dropped the niceties and began aggressively confronting the former Massachusetts governor about his position on health care and changes in his positions on other issues. They attacked Mr. Romney - and each other.
"The idea that you stand here before us and talk about that you're strong on immigration is on its face the height of hypocrisy," Mr. Perry said to Mr. Romney during a contentious exchange in Las Vegas in October.
But Mr. Perry's television advertising campaign has avoided that kind of direct engagement with Mr. Romney or any of his other rivals. His first ads have been largely biographical in nature, seeking to introduce Mr. Perry and his record to voters in Iowa and elsewhere.
The new ad is aimed directly at Mr. Obama in the hope of indirectly making the case that Mr. Perry will offer the best contrast to the current occupant of the Oval Office.
Mr. Perry and his advisers are apparently betting that attacking the president will be a more effective way of winning the support of voters than fighting with members of his own party.
For his part, Mr. Romney has employed the same strategy - so far. During the debates and on the stump, the front-runner has tended to keep most of his attacks focused on Mr. Obama. 
Will the hands-off approach work? 
History suggests that successful candidates have to do both. In 2008, the Democratic candidates for president largely avoided highly contentious personal or policy attacks against each other. During debates and in their advertisements, the Democrats usually reserved their vitriol for President George Bush.
That helped to define all of the candidates in terms of their opposition to Mr. Bush's policies. And it served to rally anxious Democratic voters who were more than eager to win after eight years of the Bush presidency.
But Mr. Obama introduced one of the first negative ads of the Democratic primary in December 2007 -- attacking Hillary Clinton and John Edwards for, ironically, backing health care plans that included an individual mandate to buy health insurance.
"Barack Obama believes the solution isn't making it illegal not to have health care. It's making it affordable," the ad said.
And Mrs. Clinton also took aim at Mr. Obama with the now-famous ad questioning whether he had the foreign policy experience and wisdom to be trusted to deal with a national security crisis in the middle of the night.
It's entirely possible -- even likely -- that Mr. Perry and Mr. Romney will eventually ratchet up their rhetorical fire against each other and against other Republicans in the race. That may depend in part on how both men do in the national polls and debates in the coming weeks.
And Ms. Bachmann, Mr. Paul and the other Republican candidates may well start airing ads that use Mr. Obama as a punching bag.
But for now, the two approaches are revealing very different strategies for winning the nomination.

HEADLINE: Pelosi Mocks Perry in Rejecting Debate Request

BYLINE: ASHLEY SOUTHALL


HIGHLIGHT: Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader in the House, said she did not have time to debate Rick Perry over his proposal to overhaul Washington. 

 BODY:
A potentially epic debate between Representative Nancy Pelosi of California and Gov. Rick Perry of Texas isn't going to happen after all.
Mr. Perry, a Republican presidential candidate, sent a letter this week to Ms. Pelosi, the Democratic leader, requesting a "public debate" on his proposal to overhaul Washington, after reading that Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the No. 2 Democrat in the House, had disparaged the plan. Mr. Perry offered to squeeze Ms. Pelosi into his schedule on Monday in Washington or next month in Iowa.
But Ms. Pelosi said Thursday that she had other things to do. During her weekly press briefing in Washington, she said she had received Mr. Perry's invitation, but was all booked. She also helped herself to a dig at the governor's "Oops!" moment in the Republican debate last week.
"Monday, I'm going to be in Portland in the morning," she said. "I'm going to be visiting some of our labs in California in the afternoon. That's two. I can't remember what the third thing is I'm going to be doing."
Mr. Perry's letter was first reported Wednesday by The Hill.
Among other things, Mr. Perry's plan calls for reducing Congress to part-time status and cutting members' yearly salary to $38,000. In the letter, he reasoned that the Washington region had become "the most affluent metropolitan area in the country because lobbyists, contractors, elected officials and bureaucrats have been insulated from the economic ruin prevalent in the private sector."
Mr. Perry's moment of forgetfulness and his overall poor performance in debates are taking a toll on his campaign, as he slips in the polls and struggles to raise money. It is quite plausible that targeting Ms. Pelosi, a liberal Democrat, was a ploy to shore up his support among conservatives.
While they won't face each other in a debate, Mr. Perry and Ms. Pelosi seem to have warmed to the idea of going at each other on Twitter.
After he was rejected on Thursday, Mr. Perry took a swipe at Ms. Pelosi for helping Democrats pass the health care overhaul when she was speaker of the House. In a message on Twitter, he wrote: "Something @NancyPelosi would like to forget: passing a 2k-page gov takeover of healthcare without reading it. American ppl haven't forgotten."
Ms. Pelosi replied repeating her earlier riff on Mr. Perry.
Mr. Perry isn't the first candidate to single out Ms. Pelosi. Herman Cain mocked her as "Princess Pelosi," though he later apologized.

HEADLINE: UBS Outlines How It Plans To Carry Out Turnaround

BYLINE: By SUSANNE CRAIG and JULIA WERDIGIER

 BODY:
When Sergio P. Ermotti entered the chandelier-drenched ballroom at the Waldorf Astoria hotel in Manhattan for his first investor day at UBS as chief executive, he started choking on a piece of food, prompting a few attendees to joke that he may have bitten off more than he can chew in taking the top spot at the beleaguered Swiss bank.
As he took to the stage, a more composed Mr. Ermotti outlined the much-anticipated turnaround strategy for the firm, which in recent months has weathered the European debt crisis, global market turmoil and a trading scandal that prompted the resignation of his predecessor and dented employee morale. 
In his speech on Thursday, Mr. Ermotti, 51, promised to shrink weak business units and to continue bolstering the bank's capital levels. He is also aiming to increase the firm's return on equity - a main measure of profitability - by several percentage points.
''We know these goals are ambitious, but we think they are achievable,'' he told the crowded room made up of largely analysts and reporters. ''Everyone will judge the success of our strategy by our ability to execute.''
UBS has endured a turbulent few years.
After becoming Europe's biggest banking casualty during the subprime drama, UBS had to be bailed out by the Swiss National Bank in 2008. The financial firm had slowly started to restore credibility and profits when the sovereign debt crisis hit, hurting business and prompting layoffs.
Then in September, a rogue trading scandal cost the firm more than $2 billion and raised serious questions about its internal risk controls. In the wake of the scandal, Oswald J. Grubel, the chief executive who was expected to revive UBS with a plan for a slimmer but more profitable bank, resigned. Kweku M. Adoboli, the former trader who has been charged with fraud and false accounting for the trades, has yet to enter a plea and faces a court hearing in London next week.
Now it is up to Mr. Ermotti, who joined UBS in April and was named chief executive on Tuesday, to convince clients and employees that the difficult times are behind.
While Mr. Ermotti declined to comment on the trading scandal at the event, he and other senior executives promised a return to the basics. They outlined plans to exit risky businesses like equity proprietary trading, where the firm makes bets with its own capital. It is also in the process of scaling back the investment bank.
Instead, the bank will focus on areas like leveraged finance and corporate lending that offer the potential for good returns with less risk. Mr. Ermotti singled out the firm's wealth management division, telling investors it was not for sale.
The bank will also continue to cut the work force. In August it announced plans to cut 3,500 jobs and said Thursday it would eliminate 400 more positions in the months to come.
But some analysts said Mr. Ermotti, who cut his teeth on Wall Street working at Merrill Lynch, faced a daunting challenge in revamping UBS at a time when the industry was streamlining and coping with stricter capital rules. Credit Suisse, a rival whose investment banking unit has been performing better, has laid out a similar strategy to UBS, raising doubts about how the banks will be able to share the shrinking demand for services and products.
Some analysts have urged more radical options for UBS. Kian Abouhossein at JPMorgan Chase wrote this month that UBS and Credit Suisse could combine their investment banking operations, a step that could create a top-five player by revenue.
On Wednesday, a former UBS chairman, Peter Kurer, who left the bank in 2009, suggested that UBS and Credit Suisse should split their investment banking businesses from the rest of the banks to satisfy shareholders.
''There are few who believe in a great future for investment banks; hardly anyone thinks that Swiss universal banks are good at running integrated investment banks,'' Mr. Kurer wrote in a commentary for Bloomberg News on Wednesday.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: A Design for Atlantic Yards' Prefab Tower

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
The developer Bruce C. Ratner unveiled the design Thursday for what would be the world's tallest prefabricated steel structure, a 32-story residential building in Brooklyn at the corner of Flatbush Avenue and Dean Street in the $4.9 billion Atlantic Yards project.
The 350-unit building would use varying rectangular shapes, colors and glass to break up the mass of the structure, which would sit snugly up against the Barclays Center, the arena for the Nets that is to open in September. Mr. Ratner, chief executive of Forest City Ratner, said that prefabrication, or modular construction, could save construction time and cut costs by as much as 25 percent. Fourteen other residential buildings would be built at Atlantic Yards using the approach. The second tower would be even taller, 50 stories. 
Forest City Ratner is also negotiating a labor agreement with construction unions, which have supported Atlantic Yards but could end up with fewer jobs and lower wages for some trades if modular construction is used.
Mr. Ratner said Thursday that he hoped to begin construction early in 2012. But the start date has been a moving target for more than a year. He may ultimately decide to build the first tower conventionally. But Mr. Ratner's company has now invested two years in studying modular construction, a technology that has existed for decades but is untested at this height. The world's tallest modular building is a 25-story dormitory in Wolverhampton, England, that was built in 2010 in less than 12 months.
In New York City, the School Construction Authority has used the technology to build classrooms, and the Capsys Corporation, a modular builder based at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, has built prefabricated steel-frame housing up to seven stories tall in Brooklyn and on Long Island.
Mr. Ratner said 60 percent of the construction would take place in a factory, where an estimated 190 workers would assemble roughly 950 steel-frame modules, each 14 feet by 35 feet, and outfit them with electric and plumbing lines, as well as with kitchen and bathroom pods. At the same time, on-site workers would build the foundation. The modules would be transported to the site, lifted into place by crane and bolted together. Steel bracing would rise with the stacked modules.
The trick for developers, architects and engineers in erecting taller modular buildings has been to design an economical bracing system to protect the structure from wind shear and seismic forces. Some modular builders say the cost of a high-rise bracing system would be prohibitive. Mr. Ratner is working with SHoP Architects, the structural engineering firm Arup and XSite Modular. ''If anybody can crack the code,'' he said, ''this group can.'' The development once promised ''upwards of 17,000 union construction jobs and over 8,000 permanent jobs.'' The large number of jobs was a significant reason the state and the city agreed to provide $300 million in direct subsidies for Atlantic Yards.
Mr. Ratner, a union builder, said modular construction would ''probably'' require the same number of workers. But under current wage scales, union workers earn less in a factory than they do on-site. A carpenter, for instance, earns $85 an hour in wages and benefits at a construction site, compared with $35 in a factory setting.
Gary LaBarbera, president of the Building and Construction Trades Council of Greater New York, said, ''We are in the process of attempting to reach an agreement that will work for the building trades and Forest City in an effort to create permanent employment.''
This week, seven Brooklyn workers who participated in a Forest City job-training program sued Mr. Ratner, Forest City and Brooklyn United for Innovative Local Development over unpaid wages and damages for what they said was the false promise of jobs. Forest City disputes the claims, saying it never promised union membership. As of September, it said, 19 of the 35 people who went through the program were working in related jobs. Still, the jobs issue has become a touchstone for opponents of the project like Councilwoman Letitia James, who denounced what she described as the growing distance between the promise and the reality of Atlantic Yards.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: More Than a Century After Edison Lost, Direct Current Gets Another Look

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KANELLOS

 BODY:
Thomas Edison and his direct current, or DC, technology lost the so-called War of the Currents to alternating current, or AC, in the 1890s after it became clear that AC was far more efficient at transmitting electricity over long distances.
Today, AC is still the standard for the electricity that comes out of our wall sockets. But DC is staging a roaring comeback in pockets of the electrical grid. 
Alstom, ABB, Siemens and other conglomerates are erecting high-voltage DC grids to carry gigawatts of electricity from wind farms in remote places like western China and the North Sea to faraway cities. Companies like SAP and Facebook that operate huge data centers are using more DC to reduce waste heat. Panasonic is even talking about building eco-friendly homes that use direct current.
In a DC grid, electrons flow from a battery or power station to a home or appliance, and then continue to flow in a complete circuit back to the original source. In AC, electrons flow back and forth between generators and appliances in a precisely synchronized manner -- imagine a set of interlocking canals where water continually surges back and forth but the water level at any given point stays constant.
Direct current was the electrical transmission technology when Edison started rolling out electric wires in the 19th century. Alternating current, which operated at higher voltages, was later championed by the Edison rivals Nikola Tesla and George Westinghouse.
The AC forces won when Tesla and Westinghouse figured out how to fine-tune AC transmission so that it required far fewer power plants and copper cable.
DC didn't die, however.
AT&T adopted direct current for the phone system because of its inherent stability, which is part of the reason that landline phones often survive storms better than the electric grid.
And household appliances and much industrial equipment -- everything from hair dryers to jet planes -- are built to use DC. Embedded converters bridge the mismatch between the AC grid and the DC devices on the fly.
But those constant conversions cause power losses. For example, in conventional data centers, with hundreds of computers, electricity might be converted and ''stepped down'' in voltage five times before being used. All that heat must be removed by air-conditioners, which consumes more power.
In a data center redesigned to use more direct current, monthly utility bills can be cut by 10 to 20 percent, according to Trent Waterhouse, vice president of marketing for power electronics at General Electric.
''You can cut the number of power conversions in half,'' Mr. Waterhouse said.
On a far smaller scale, SAP spent $128,000 retrofitting a data center at its offices in Palo Alto, Calif. The project cut its energy bills by $24,000 a year.
The revival of DC for long-distance power transmission began in 1954 when the Swedish company ASEA, a predecessor of ABB, the Swiss maker of power and automation equipment, linked the island of Gotland to mainland Sweden with high-voltage DC lines.
Now, more than 145 projects using high-voltage DC, known as HVDC, are under way worldwide.
While HVDC equipment remains expensive, it becomes economical for high-voltage, high-capacity runs over long distances, said Anders Sjoelin, president of power systems for North America at ABB.
Over a distance of a thousand miles, an HVDC line carrying thousands of megawatts might lose 6 to 8 percent of its power, ABB said. A similar AC line might lose 12 to 25 percent.
Direct-current transmission is also better suited to handle the electricity produced by solar and wind farms, which starts out as direct current.
In most situations, solar or wind energy has to be converted, and sometimes reconverted, into AC before it can be used. With HVDC, conversions can be reduced. DC grids can also more easily manage the variable output that occurs, say, when a storm hits or the wind dies.
In the United States, the Tres Amigas power station in New Mexico will use HVDC links to connect the nation's three primary grids -- the eastern, western and Texas grids. Ideally, it will create a marketplace where customers in New York and Los Angeles will be able to buy power from wind farms in Texas, which often have to dump power because of the lack of local demand.
HVDC Light, a version of HVDC invented by ABB in 1997 that is designed for shorter distances, has started to gain popularity because its cables are coated with extruded plastic. That allows cables to be buried underground more easily, avoiding some of the land-use hearings that have delayed proposals for above-ground AC transmission lines in the United States and Europe.
Direct current is also getting more attention at the level of individual buildings.
Nextek Power Systems, for example, has developed a system for delivering power via DC to lights and motion sensors through a building's metal frame, instead of through wires.
Paul Savage, chief executive of Nextek, based in Detroit, understands why the public might view that notion with trepidation. But he said the current was not enough to electrocute anyone.
''If you licked your fingers you might get a little bubbly feeling, like if you put a nine-volt battery on your tongue, but it is not noticeable if you're in a non-wet environment,'' he said.
Of course, AC remains by far the dominant standard for electricity, and many are dubious about ''DC is better'' arguments.
Hardware for HVDC and other direct-current applications is expensive, so capital costs have to be recovered through efficiency. Google, never shy about experimenting with energy-saving technologies, has veered away from DC data centers, claiming that the capital costs do not justify the switch.
Still, sales and sales inquiries are climbing, DC advocates said. Just don't expect Current War II, said Mr. Sjoelin.
''This is a complement,'' he said. ''We're not going back to Edison.''
